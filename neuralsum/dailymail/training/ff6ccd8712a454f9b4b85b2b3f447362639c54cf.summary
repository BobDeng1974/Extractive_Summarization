@entity0 has vowed to crack down on bloggers who post porn , telling them that their posts will be hidden from view if they do n’t clean up their act			1
people who publish material on the company ’s @entity9 platform now have just one month to remove any explicit photographs and videos			1
after march 23 , @entity0 will make any offensive accounts ‘ private ’ , effectively making them impossible to view by anyone other than the account holder			1
@entity0 has announced changes to its @entity9 platform banning graphic images from public view blogs created after the deadline may also be taken down			1
@entity0 used to only ban content that was illegal , or had been published without the consent of the people it featured			1
but it now says explicit photographs will have to be justifiable on ‘ artistic , educational , documentary , or scientific grounds ’			2
@entity0 changed its rules following a @entity32 campaign to get firms to take more responsibility for the content published on their websites			1
earlier this month , it emerged that porn actors and publishers are using @entity41 to get past family - friendly online filters , putting explicit images within reach of children			2
@entity0 changed its policy following a campaign by the @entity32 for it to take more responsibility for content a study found that 500,000 graphic images and videos are published on the site every day , but @entity41 has so far refused to address the problem			1
separately , @entity55 said in its updated privacy terms tuesday it would ban ' involuntary pornography ' or ' revenge porn ' starting march 10			2
according to the company : ' if you believe that someone has submitted , without your permission , to @entity55 a link to a photograph , video , or digital image of you in a state of nudity or engaged in any act of sexual conduct , please contact us ... and we will expedite its removal as quickly as possible			0
@entity55 prohibits the posting of such content without consent			0
' the move comes after @entity55 gained notoriety for hosting forums used to post nude pictures hacked from other online accounts in 2014			0
that included pictures of celebrities including actress @entity87 , pop icon @entity88 and top model @entity89			0
' last year , we missed a chance to be a leader in social media when it comes to protecting your privacy			0
' no matter who you are , if a photograph , video , or digital image of you in a state of nudity , sexual excitement , or engaged in any act of sexual conduct , is posted or linked to on @entity55 without your permission , it is prohibited on @entity55			0
' @entity55 was also criticised for allowing users to post pictures of underage girls , before shutting down forums used for that purpose			0
@entity55 three years ago banned child pornography and posting of sexually suggestive material involving minors .			0

explicit blogs will have to be removed from @entity0 by march 23
pornographic blogs and videos will no *longer* be publicly *searchable*
the change follows a campaign by the @entity32 to protect children
