by @entity0 published : 20:38 est , 15 january 2013 updated : 06:48 est , 16 january 2013 aside from a smattering of nervous laughter , the ballroom of the @entity2 descended into silence on sunday night as @entity6 began a speech that many @entity9 observers have long believed she would never make			1
on stage to accept a @entity12 lifetime achievement award at the @entity13 , she announced she had a ‘ sudden urge to say something that i ’ve never really been able to air in public ’			1
in the rambling seven - minute speech that followed , @entity6 talked obliquely and sometimes even in the third person about a private life she has guarded fiercely for decades			1
outspoken : the usually fiercely private star addressed her personal life in a heartfelt speech at the @entity13 as she accepted her lifetime achievement award some are still wondering what exactly the @entity25 - winning star of the accused and @entity27 did admit , but the text of her speech left little room for doubt			1
for the first time in her career , @entity6 publicly addressed her own sexuality			1
although she never mentioned the words ‘ gay ’ or ‘ lesbian ’ , @entity6 appeared to end years of speculation about her private life			1
as her two sons watched from the audience in a rare public appearance with their mother , @entity6 plunged in			2
she said she had to acknowledge @entity44 , ‘ one of the deepest loves of my life , my heroic co-parent , my ex-partner in love but righteous soul sister in life ’			1
as she said this , the woman in question sat with her head bowed with emotion a seat away from their two boys			0
‘ thank you , @entity61			0
i am so proud of our modern family			0
our amazing sons , @entity65 , who are my reason to breathe and to evolve , my blood and soul			0
’ as the showbusiness world digested the speech yesterday , it was clear from social media sites that scores of fans had been taken completely by surprise by the 50 - year - old @entity6 ’s coded revelations			2
many simply wanted to know who @entity44 was			2
for years referred to simply as @entity6 ’s ‘ constant companion ’ or ‘ close friend ’ , miss @entity44 ’s relationship with the actress has long been cloaked in uncertainty thanks to @entity6 ’s intense privacy			1
they met on the set of the 1993 @entity88 film @entity86 — in which @entity6 starred with @entity90 — and were reportedly quickly in a serious relationship together			2
miss @entity44 — a film producer nearly ten years older who could pass for @entity6 ’s dowdier sister — soon moved into the actress ’s @entity9 mansion			1
' my righteous soul sister ' : the actress with her former partner @entity98 in @entity9 in 1998 , their relationship was cemented after they took shared parenting roles for the first of @entity6 ’s children , @entity105 , who was conceived by artificial insemination			1
@entity6 had her second son , @entity108 , in 2001 in the same circumstances			2
the father of both boys is believed to have been a friend of @entity6 , a gay casting director named @entity113 , who died of heart disease in 2007			2
it is believed it was the lasting influence of mr @entity113 , who campaigned for understanding for gay teenagers struggling with their sexuality , that convinced @entity6 she had to come out			1
mr @entity113 ’s mother , the @entity121 , said this week that her son treated @entity6 ’s two boys as if they were his own , but agreed to sign papers guaranteeing to keep secret the truth about their paternity			2
@entity6 , she added , plans to tell her boys their father ’s identity when they turn 21			2
in interviews , @entity6 has talked about her determination to give the boys a ‘ normal ’ family life , which she never had			1
thus it was that miss @entity44 legally adopted both children and shouldered many of the parenting duties , taking turns with @entity6 to drive them to school in their matching @entity142 convertibles			1
the couple spent most of their time at home , indulging their shared passions for yoga and organic food			0
although @entity6 said she refused to have the usual household staff employed by @entity9 stars because she did n’t want a ‘ bunch of strangers ’ in the house , friends suggested she was simply terrified of her unconventional home life leaking out			1
@entity6 ’s secrecy would lead to bizarre scenes at film premieres , as miss @entity44 and the children waited quietly in the crowd for @entity6 ’s red - carpet arrival before making their own way inside , unnoticed by photographers			1
for several years , the two women wore matching eternity rings on their wedding fingers , and in december 2007 @entity6 first publicly acknowledged the relationship , gushing at a private awards ceremony speech about ‘ my beautiful @entity44 , who sticks with me through the rotten and the bliss ’			1
modern family : the 50 - year - old actress , hugs sons kit , 11 , and 14 - year - old @entity65 , at a @entity13 party at the @entity176 within five months , however , they had split			0
it emerged that @entity6 had found a new lover , screenwriter @entity179 , whom she had met two years earlier on the set of the film @entity181			1
the glamorous miss @entity179 was 14 years younger than @entity6 , and famous for writing explicit sex scenes for @entity184 ’s usually prudish tv sitcom world			1
' deepest love ' : @entity186 and @entity6 on holiday in @entity188 in 2005 she could n’t have been more different than the somewhat mumsy miss @entity44 , and she left the actress the following year , leaving @entity190 reportedly deeply upset			1
@entity121 said the last she had heard , @entity6 had been dating a @entity192 athlete , although it is clear that nobody has replaced miss @entity44 in @entity6 ’s affections			1
indeed , despite speculation that @entity44 could have laid claim to a portion of the actress ’s $ 25 million fortune , the pair separated amicably , and miss @entity44 is now understood to live in one of @entity6 ’s @entity204 homes			1
though this week ’s touching tribute has made plain @entity6 ’s affection for miss @entity44 , their 15 - year relationship was not @entity6 ’s first experience of lesbianism			1
she had an unsettled childhood after her father , a retired air force colonel , left her mother , film producer @entity213 , shortly after @entity6 was conceived			2
her mother then moved in with a lesbian lover named @entity216 , whom @entity6 and her older three siblings called ‘ @entity218 ’			0
from the age of three , when she appeared in a tv commercial for suncream , @entity6 was the household ’s sole breadwinner			2
a 1997 , biography of the actress by her disaffected brother @entity226 described a supremely dysfunctional showbusiness family			0
@entity213 was portrayed as hot tempered and sometimes violent , frittering away her children ’s showbiz earnings			0
as for his sister ’s sexuality , @entity226 claimed she ’d had several boyfriends and had become ‘ smitten ’ with @entity236 actor @entity235 after starring together in the 1987 erotic drama @entity233			0
but he had never doubted she was lesbian or bisexual , he said			0
a furious @entity6 cut her brother off for good			0
firm friend : the late @entity113 , seen with @entity6 at the @entity239 in 1997 , left , and the @entity240 , right , is rumoured to be the father of her two sons , who were conceived through artificial insemination it would be a psychiatrist ’s job to say whether her father ’s desertion of her mother coloured @entity6 ’s view of men , but it is certainly true to say she has spent her career picking roles of strong women fighting against abusive men			0
@entity6 became famous at 14 playing a child prostitute opposite @entity256 in the 1976 film @entity258			0
she went on to win @entity240 for her performances as a gang - raped waitress in the accused and as an @entity263 agent on the trail of a serial killer in @entity266			0
what is particularly noticeable is that she has n’t had a romantic lead since gazing into @entity90 ’s eyes in @entity86 19 years ago — coincidentally , the film on which she met @entity44			2
perhaps she did n’t want to take on major roles when she was devoting so much time to raising her sons — or perhaps directors thought audiences might find @entity6 smooching with male leads faintly ridiculous given the rumours			2
celebrations : @entity279 was seated at @entity6 's table at the ceremony , where she was honoured with a lifetime achievement award for her decades in the movie business proud : the oscar - winner 's sons looked on with pride from the audience as their mother made her emotional speech at the @entity13 even if she has had to watch as the glitzy roles have gone to less talented actresses , @entity6 has stolen the limelight back now			1
she spoke forcefully at the @entity13 about how actors had the right to privacy , which begs the question of why she bothered to step out of the closet now			0
was it simply because she is a little mature for glamour roles and no longer needs to worry about her public image ? certainly lesbianism can damage an actress ’s career in @entity184			0
comedian @entity304 said it took three years to resurrect her career and personal life after she came out in 1997			0
for now , we must wait to see what effect , if any , the @entity13 speech has on @entity6 ’s career			0
@entity184 ’s gay community is divided ; some admire her candour , others complain it took far too long for her to acknowledge the truth ( gay activists tried to force her to admit her sexuality as long ago as the @entity320 , when they plastered posters of her bearing the aggressive phrase ‘ absolutely queer ’ around @entity192 cities )			0
still , nobody was left in any doubt that @entity6 ’s speech , though carefully scripted , was from the heart			0
‘ i want to be seen , to be understood deeply and to be not so very lonely , ’ she said with a smile			0
observers took it to be a reference to her song @entity332 , in which — aged 13 — she crooned ‘ you do n’t have to be lonely ’ to a room of smitten child gangsters in the 1976 film @entity336			0
it was surely meant lightheartedly , but as an actress who has spent most of her career concealing her true self , it seemed strangely fitting .			0

the actress publicly addressed her sexuality for the first time as she accepted a @entity12 lifetime achievement award
*albeit* obliquely , @entity6 appeared to end years of speculation about her private life as she referred to her ' deep love ' for ex @entity44
