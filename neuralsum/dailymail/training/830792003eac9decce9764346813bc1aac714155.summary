life may really be out there			0
astronomers have found the first evidence of habitable planets outside our own solar system			1
the discovery of the shattered remains of an asteroid which once contained huge amounts of water - crucial for life - has left scientists ‘ incredibly excited ’			1
it suggests that hundreds of millions of years ago , the distant system may have harboured @entity17 - like planets			1
an artist 's impression shows a rocky and water - rich asteroid being torn apart by the strong gravity of the white dwarf star @entity23 shattered remains of the asteroid have been discovered 150 million light years from @entity17 but any potential inhabitants would be long since left the region - either extinct or mastering space travel - as their sun blew up and then collapsed into a ‘ white dwarf ’			1
now all that remains are rocky bodies orbiting the dead star			2
scientists believe it is a glimpse into the distant future of our own corner of the universe , after the @entity40 finally burns out			1
but there is no need for alarm - the end is still several billion years away			0
professor @entity45 of the @entity46 at the @entity47 said : ‘ it is the first time we have found a rocky body that also contains water outside our solar system			1
‘ those two ingredients - a rocky surface and water - are key in the hunt for habitable planets outside our solar system , so it ’s very exciting to find them together outside our solar system			1
‘ what this means is that we have the building blocks of what makes planets like @entity17			2
’ he said it was too early to speculate if the region supported alien life , and that if it had existed , it would be long departed following the collapse of the sun. the images , captured by the @entity73 space telescope , are said to give a glimpse into the distant future of our own corner of the universe , after the @entity40 finally burns out ‘ at this stage in its existence , all that remains of this rocky body is simply dust and debris that has been pulled into the orbit of its dying parent star , ’ he said			1
‘ however this planetary graveyard swirling around the embers of its parent star is a rich source of information about its former life			0
in these remnants lie chemical clues which point towards a previous existence as a water - rich terrestrial body			0
’ the research , which appears in the journal @entity98 and was made using @entity100 ’s @entity73 telescope , looked at the light emitted by @entity102			0
the region located 150 light years away from the @entity17			1
astronomers detected an abundance of ‘ rocky ’ elements such as magnesium , silicon and iron , and also found oxygen in quantities that indicated a large amounts of water			2
only a water - rich massive asteroid , or minor planet , can explain the observations , they claimed			2
the discovery suggests that hundreds of millions of years ago , the distant system may have harboured @entity17 - like planets @entity17 is essentially a ‘ dry ’ planet , with only 0.02 per cent of its mass made up of surface water			1
our oceans only formed after the planet was formed , likely a result of water - rich asteroids or comets crashed into us			0
the latest findings suggest something similar could have happened in this distant solar system			1
lead author @entity132 , from @entity134 ’s @entity133 , said : ‘ the finding of water in a large asteroid means the building blocks of habitable planets existed - and maybe still exist - in the @entity102 system , and likely also around substantial number of similar parent stars			2
‘ these water - rich building blocks , and the terrestrial planets they build , may in fact be common - a system can not create things as big as asteroids and avoid building planets , and @entity102 had the ingredients to deliver lots of water to their surfaces			2
under the weather : @entity154 is the first exoplanet to have its clouds mapped			0
‘ our results demonstrate that there was definitely potential for habitable planets in this exoplanetary system			0
’ scientists believe that the universe could be teeming with planets that are able to support life			2
latest @entity100 estimates suggest that there could be as many as 60 million habitable planets			0
data taken from the @entity172 telescope , which has spent several years exploring exoplanets outside of the solar system , had suggested that there could be at least one planet that is capable of supporting life close to each red dwarf			1
but that theory has since been revised as @entity100 scientists now also believe that cloud cover could potentially help a planet support life			0
in order for life to occur on a planet , it needs to be within the habitable zone of a star - that is close enough for water on its surface to stay in its liquid form			0
the great beyond : @entity100 have discovered dozens of exoplanets , including the extremely hot wasp - 12b and its host star , pictured			0
but this is the first time that they have found the basic ingredients for a habitable planet if a planet is too close to its star , the water vapourises as it is too hot			2
but if it is too far away , the water freezes			0
thanks to exploration from telescopes such as @entity172 and the @entity217 telescope , scientists ' knowledge of planets outside our solar system is becoming increasingly sophisticated			1
last week @entity100 released the first ever map of cloud cover on an exoplanet - kepler - 7b			0
the image offered a first look at clouds on hot @entity224 - like planet @entity154 which is some 1,000 light - years away from the @entity17			1
the @entity172 telescope has discovered more than 150 confirmed planets outside the solar system			1
the telescope 's problematic reaction wheels prevent it from hunting planets any more , but astronomers continue to pore over almost four years ' worth of collected data from the planets already discovered			0
it is hoped that the same cloud - mapping techniques can be used to observe smaller @entity17 - like worlds .			0

shattered remains of asteroid discovered 150 light years away from the @entity17
it is the first time that both water and a rocky surface have been found beyond our solar system
scientists believe it is a glimpse into the distant future of our own corner of the universe
