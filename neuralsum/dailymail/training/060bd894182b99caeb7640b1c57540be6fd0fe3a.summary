by @entity0 a group of @entity3 parents are saying that the sound of the angelic voices of children singing @entity8 carols is not a joyful noise			1
they have accused the @entity11 in @entity12 , @entity3 of creating an environment that allows bullying by including yuletide tunes that reference @entity15 at a school holiday concert			1
the protesting parents say their children are ' forced to be reformed to what is seen as the majority ' by singing the holiday melodies and claimed their children would be ' singled out ' and ' targeted ' if they did not join in with the caroling			1
caroling caroling now we go : parents at a school in @entity3 have complained at the inclusion of religious songs at a @entity8 school concert ( pictured the @entity31 in november ) for the concert on december 12 , students from kindergarten to the third grade sang , ' @entity36 , ' ' up on a @entity37 , ' ' @entity38 , ' ' @entity39 , ' ' o come @entity40 , ' ' @entity41 , ' a @entity43 lullaby , a @entity45 song , a pinata song , a @entity48 rhythm piece and ' @entity49 ' for the finale			1
students in the fourth and fifth grade had a separate concert where they sang , ' @entity55 , ' ' @entity54 , ' ' @entity56 , ' ' @entity57 , ' ' @entity38 ' and ' @entity58 , ' for the concluding song			0
an anonymous letter was sent to the school superintendent last week , expressing outrage at the repertoire of holiday tunes			1
' we pay the taxes for this school			0
it is a public school			0
i have no problem with children having personal religious practices at school but to choose one religion and make it part of the curriculum is wrong , ' the author , who only identified themselves as representing ' @entity80 , ' wrote			1
@entity81 : some parents at the @entity11 in @entity12 , @entity3 have said singing carols at school can give way to bullying since students will feel singled out in they do n't join in ' my children are crying because they do n't want to be singled out but what they are doing in school directly conflicts with their faith , ' the parent continued , claiming students would be ' targeted ' if they expressed discomfort at singing a religious carol			1
' bullying is such a hot topic , yet that seems to be what is occurring here , ' the parent wrote , adding that the students were being ' forced to be reformed to what is seen as the majority			1
' but the school denied that the selection of holiday songs was creating antagonism among the students , according to @entity110 , the fine arts director for the school district who oversaw the musical selection			1
' if i thought students were being bullied we would take measures to ensure that was n't happening , ' he told the @entity118			0
according to @entity110 , the musical offerings try ' to strike a balance ' between the different traditions of the holidays			0
' we want the students to be exposed to a number of things			0
there will be some years where there will be no sacred music and some years there is			0
' ' every year we get comments from one side or the other			0
either the concert is too religious or it 's not religious enough			2
' discomfort : an unidentified parent wrote to the school , explaining how their child was traumatized by the caroling tradition though the unnamed parent threatened to take legal action against the public school for mentioning the name of @entity15 in a song , a @entity141 legal specialist doubted the case would have much merit			1
' it does n't create a constitutional crisis to sing @entity8 songs at @entity154 , ' @entity149 , senior counsel at @entity150 ( @entity150 ) , told the @entity118			1
mr @entity149 noted the educational importance of the concert as a ' truncated view of our culture and of music in general			0
' ' if every time there was a piece of art or classical musical with a religious theme , we censored it - we would be eliminating much from the students ' education			0
' mr @entity149 added there is no ' basis for a legal challenge ' in the complaint from the @entity3 parents , who have yet to identify themselves			2
he noted another example that occurred in late october , when an atheist group complained that students at the @entity178 in @entity179 , @entity176 were invited to a local church to see a performance of ' a @entity8			2
' though the trip was voluntary and the program not religious in nature , a statement from the @entity183 said , ' the problem is that it 's got religious content and it 's being performed in a religious venue and that does n't just blur the line between church and state , it oversteps it entirely			1
' @entity8 or @entity195 ? the conservative group , the @entity196 , has alerted members to declare their support for @entity8 ( left ) while secularists say it is better to keep the holiday neutral similar to the @entity3 case , an anonymous parent of an @entity176 student was angered by the invitation and said that even though she could opt to not allow her child to attend , she agreed to let her daughter participate because she feared the girl would be singled out			1
some have gone as far to say that there is a ' @entity211 , ' with religious imagery and even the word @entity8 being deemed offensive			2
a conservative @entity215 group , the @entity196 , has even compiled a list of retailers and rated the brands based on how overtly they incorporate @entity8 into their holiday retailing			2
they assign a top @entity223 rating to brands that promote @entity8 on an ' exceptional ' basis in their marketing efforts and a @entity229 rating to stores that refer to @entity8 on a regular basis			2
a yellow rating means the company refers infrequently to @entity8 infrequently and a @entity235 rating is left for those brands that use @entity8 sparingly			2
reason for the season : religious references , like this nativity scene at a home , have increasingly come under scrutiny despite all the buzz regarding the religious songs on the program at the @entity247 school , @entity110 reported that the december 12 concert was a success			1
several hundred proud parents and family members turned out to watch the show and the kids were excited as ever to get dressed up and perform			0
he said the school wants to give a ' flavor of the the rich tradition in @entity258 ' of different faiths and different cultures			0
' we 're not advancing or inhibiting any religion , ' he clarified			0
he said he has received complaints in the past and it disappointed that this parent has chosen to not identify themselves and provide specifics of a potential problem			0
' if someone is really upset at singing a song , nobody makes them do it			0
' ' i would need for the parent to be a more specific as to how their children was being bullied , in order to know how to prevent it , ' he added .			2

' @entity284 is such a hot topic , yet that seems to be what is occurring here , ' an anonymous parent wrote about carols at school concert
parents threatened legal action if the program did n't *evolve* to become more secular
school choir director said the songs were selected to expose children to all different types of holiday *heritages*
legal expert says there 's no ' constitutional crisis to sing @entity8 songs '
