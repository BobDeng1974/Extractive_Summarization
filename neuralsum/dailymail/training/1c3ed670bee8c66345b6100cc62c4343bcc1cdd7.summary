by @entity0 for @entity1 an anonymous food critic has spent the past two years travelling the @entity3 in hunt of the perfect full @entity5			2
the amateur reviewer 's opinion has become so well respected that the sought - after stickers he rewards for a good review are being displayed like @entity11 stars in restaurants			2
the @entity13 , as he is known as on his blog , rewards restaurants , cafes and tea rooms with a sticker printed with ' inspector recommended ' if he awards the breakfast a score of 8.5 or higher			1
a secret reviewer has been travelling the @entity3 sampling @entity3 's favourite breakfast , the full @entity5			2
pictured here , @entity25 , @entity26 , which received nine out of ten in a rave review the self - appointed taste tester is no stranger to the full @entity5 , having rated over 300 breakfasts from across the country			1
the inspector publishes his reviews on his blog , which has attracted more than 750,000 views since he started it			1
the faceless diner started his quest for the perfect breakfast after a particularly bad and overpriced offering at a chain hotel			1
since then , his dedication has seen him post a review complete with his own photos every time he eats his morning meal out			0
the reviewer began his mission in his hometown of @entity26 and has since samples fry - ups in @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52			1
his devotion to dining has even lead him to other breakfast items overseas			2
the hard - to - please reviewer has even sampled @entity58 versions of his favourite morning meal			0
the @entity13 has rewarded twelve of his best reviews to restaurants in his home town of @entity26 , such as this one , the @entity64 , @entity26 , which was rated a nine out of ten although the inspector has gobbled almost a year 's worth of the fried dish he claims that he has maintained a slim physique			1
the middle - aged - man says that he prefers to stick to a diet of fish and steamed veg during the week and only indulges in a fried breakfast at weekends			2
despite his packed schedule , the @entity13 squeezes in his day job working with adults with learning difficulties and his reviews serve purely as a hobby			1
the critic says that when it comes to a good review it is n't just down to taste , he likes to feel welcomed by the staff and for the restaurant to have a good atmosphere			1
pictured here , the breakfast at @entity92 's , @entity51 8.5/10 , which also got a nine out of ten his success could be down to his involvement in subject as he arguess that so many other restaurant reviews are completely impersonal			1
' i was getting frustrated as other websites reviewing breakfasts had such little information on them			0
' i wanted to write something far more detailed to make sure people would know when places were open for breakfast , what was on the menu and what the experience was like			1
' i learnt that a lot of people go out for breakfast at least a couple of times a month and with so many places to choose from it can be a bit of a gamble so my blog helps them locate the places that are going to be good			2
' i think i must have hit a gap in the market , i do push it on social media , but i think it 's also down to growing a fan base			0
' not impressed : the @entity125 shopping centre cafe only received 3.5/10 ( left ) and @entity126			0
@entity127 , @entity26 , received a poor 2/10 the inspector judges each breakfast on six key aspects - first impressions , service , ingredients , presentation , taste and value			1
to reach a final score for the breakfast the inspector adds together each individual score for the six elements and averages them out			0
when it comes to rewarding a restaurant with a good review he looks for a great atmosphere and friendly waiters			0
' i want simplicity in the ordering process			0
i also think about the vibe of the place			0
' you could have the most amazing breakfast in the world , but if the staff are rude and make you feel like you should n't be there then you do n't have a good experience			2
' restaurants who receive an 8.5 or more are able to request one of @entity163 much sought after inspector recommended stickers when reviewing taste the critic has a meticulous process and does n't let any mistake go unnoticed			1
' i focus on how it 's cooked , anything that 's not quite right , items that do n't have any flavour			0
' my wife prefers a vegetarian breakfast			0
this is quite handy as i can get a photo of the veggie breakfast too			0
' restaurants can be sure to expect a negative review if staff are unwelcoming , use crockery that has seen better days or get his order wrong			0
any breakfast which scores 8.5 or higher means the establishment can contact his blog to ask for one of his circular recommended stickers			1
for the @entity26 - born reviewer , it appears that when it comes to a good breakfast there is no place like home , with 12 restaurants bestowed with the sticker in his birth town in the past two years			1
his best reviews have dished out compliments such as ' out of this world ' and ' cooked perfectly			0
' some restaurants have not received the same flattery and can probably expect a dip in sales being described as ' a sorry sight ' and compared with ' chewing on foam ' .			0

the @entity13 has gained a *reputation* as an expert on breakfast
he started his blog after one particularly bad fry up experience
he gives restaurants a ranking out of 10
any restaurant who receives 8.5 or more is rewarded with a sticker
the critic has given 12 out in @entity26 , his hometown
