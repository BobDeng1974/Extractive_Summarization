soviets may have spent up to $ 1billion on unconventional psychology research from as early as 1917 , it has emerged			0
a new report uncovering previously classified information has revealed how the @entity1 worked tirelessly to come up with a mind control programme that would rival that of the @entity7 the paper by @entity9 confirms for the first time that @entity1 used methods to manipulate test subjects ' brains			1
dr. @entity14 , electrical engineer , conducting a demonstration of @entity1 scientific data and schematics for beaming a magnetic field into the brain to cause visual hallucinations the work titled ' unconventional research in @entity1 and @entity23 : short overview ' details the experiments researchers called ' psychotronics '			2
@entity9 , of the @entity27 of @entity28 and @entity29 in @entity30 , @entity31 , based the work on @entity23 technical journals			0
he reveals how @entity1 developed a device to generate and store high - frequency electromagnetic radiation called ' cerpan '			1
' if the generator is designed properly , it is able to accumulate bioenergy from all living things - animals , plants , humans - and then release it outside , ' writes @entity9			0
the pyschotronics program or ' parapsychology ' as it was called in the @entity7 involves unconventional research into mind and control and remote influence , reports news.com			1
the new information sheds light on @entity1 efforts to research the phenomenon of mind - control using unconventional methods			2
( image taken from @entity58 , a @entity31 documentary ) the original scheme of transmitting and receiving bio-circuitry of the human nervous system as depicted in the report while the two countries worked on their relative projects in secrecy , the report reveals much of what they were investigating was the same			0
indeed the psychotronics program draws similarities to @entity7 's @entity70 - a human research operation experimenting in the behavioral control of humans through the @entity75 's @entity74			1
the program was introduced in 1950 - some 30 years after the @entity1 ' efforts in parapsychology research			1
though paper reveals the @entity1 's early research into the subject , it does not disclose the results of such experiments or whether or not similar work is ongoing in @entity23 today			2
an example of a generator from the psychotronics program of which very little was known in previous years unlike the @entity1 ' research , @entity70 has been well documented since being shut down in 1973			1
the program was officially sanctioned in 1953 , and carried out much of its research illegally by enlisting unwitting subjects who were , on occasion , subjected to taking drugs without their knowledge			2
researchers used various methodologies to manipulate people 's mental states and alter brain functions , including hypnosis , sensory deprivation , isolation , verbal and sexual abuse , as well as various forms of torture			0
as many as 80 institutions carried out the research including universities , hospitals and colleges			0
it was first brought to the attention of the public in 1975 by the @entity116 , but all files relating to the research had been destroyed under the instruction of former @entity75 director @entity120 in 1973 .			0

report uncovers previously classified @entity1 research into mind control
@entity1 researchers investigated subject some 30 years before @entity7 program
soviets made device to create high - frequency electromagnetic radiation
@entity7 's *controversial* @entity70 experimented in control of humans
the @entity75 - run program sometimes forced test subjects to take drugs
