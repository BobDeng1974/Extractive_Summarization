by @entity1 medical correspondent trials to dissuade addiction by providing heroin addicts with ' rewards ' for staying clean have been taking place all over the @entity7 heroin addicts are to be given weekly £ 10 supermarket vouchers in a bid to help them give up their habit			1
the @entity13 will reward drug users with the vouchers for remaining clean during a 12 - week treatment programme – meaning they could ‘ earn ’ up to £ 120 in total			1
the trial – which is taking place at 33 sites around @entity7 – follows a study by researchers who found that the number of heroin addicts who completed a course of three hepatitis b jabs soared when they were rewarded with shopping vouchers			1
the researchers said the financial incentive had been a ‘ game - changer ’ and could have a huge impact on drug treatment as well as other public health initiatives			0
the study was led by professor @entity35 from the @entity36 at @entity37 , working with colleagues from @entity39 and @entity40			1
almost half of those given graduated payments – £ 5 for the first jab , followed by subsequent payments of £ 10 and £ 15 – attended all three appointments , according to a report in @entity49 medical journal			1
professor @entity35 said the ethics of giving financial incentives to drug addicts was a matter for ‘ wider debate ’ but added that it would be a ‘ massive saving in terms of efficiency of the delivery ’ of the vaccination programme			1
‘ why would you not want to do a vaccination programme where you get 45 per cent uptake ? ’ he said			0
professor @entity35 , one of the country 's top experts on drug dependence , has been leading the scheme , and argues that monetary incentives are a good way to ensure most are vaccinated ‘ i can understand the anxieties			1
suggesting this at a time of austerity is difficult but are you really going to shirk from making a difficult decision which is cost - saving ? ’ the research team conceded it was possible that addicts might trade in the vouchers to feed their habit , but said that the evidence suggested otherwise			1
almost 700 addicts are being recruited for the trial , all of whom want to stop taking drugs			1
some will get reward vouchers if their urine tests are clean or they are taking their medication over a three - month period			1
professor @entity35 said the success of the hepatitis b study suggests the approach should be rolled out nationwide to boost vaccine uptake , given that one in five of 250,000 injecting drug users in the @entity7 has the virus			1
around 700 heroin addicts have been recruited for the trial so far , all of whom want to stop taking drugs the costs to the @entity13 of treating the disease were high , as was the human cost of potential transmission to their families , he added			1
he said there was scope for financial incentives to help in other ways , such as encouraging people to take statin drugs , or for the homeless to finish a course of tb treatment			2
however @entity115 , co-director of the campaign group @entity116 , questioned whether addicts should be paid for changing their ways			2
‘ in a time of austerity this is not the best way of spending taxpayers ’ money , ’ she said			0
more must be done to help the rising tide of people who are injecting themselves with steroids , health experts have also warned			2
reports suggest the number of people , including teenagers , who use steroids and other performance or image enhancing drugs is ' rapidly increasing ' , the @entity129 ( @entity129 ) said			2
outreach programmes should be set up in gyms to try to reach this group of drug users , @entity129 said			0
people who use these drugs do not see themselves as having a drug problem , a @entity129 spokesman said			2
in fact , they see themselves as ' fit and healthy ' despite the fact that people who inject themselves with any type of drug are at a heightened risk of @entity152 and hepatitis			0
@entity129 warned that anabolic steroid use is ' relatively widespread ' with an estimated 59,000 people aged 16 to 59 using the drug in @entity157 and @entity158 in the last year			2
but @entity129 said these estimates are ' conservative ' and said that needle and syringe programmes have reported ' rapidly increasing ' numbers of steroid users attending their services			0
@entity165 , harm reduction lead for @entity167 - a needle and syringe programme in @entity170 , said : ' we run a weekly clinic for steroid users but we have people coming through the door on a daily basis , with at least seven new clients a week			0
' we know there are many more people out there who are not using needle and syringe programmes because this group of users do not see themselves as drug users			0
traditionally they are more sexually active than users of heroin or crack , so there is more potential for the spread of infections through sex			0
' people who inject steroids are potentially using them without the correct education or the correct equipment and this can lead to more and more people injecting unsafely , which can put not just their own life , but the lives of those around them , at risk			0
' those who use steroids should be able to get the same support as anyone else who injects drugs			0
this guideline will make sure that services across the country are at the high standard they should be			0

almost 700 addicts are being recruited for the trial ,
the trials are is taking place across 33 sites in the @entity7
all of the addicts who have *signed* up want to stop taking drugs
some will get reward vouchers if their urine tests are clean

study led by professor @entity35 from @entity37
medical experts also say steroid use is on the rise among the young
