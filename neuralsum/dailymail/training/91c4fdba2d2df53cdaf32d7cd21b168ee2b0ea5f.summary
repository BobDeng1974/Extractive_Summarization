bearing in mind she is about to become the most hated woman in @entity3 , at least in the eyes of benefits cheats , @entity0 looks very relaxed			1
as the photographer ’s flash gun goes off , she laughs and jokes about it ’s dazzling brightness in her @entity11 accent : ‘ great , it looks like it gets rid of wrinkles			0
’ @entity0 ’s title of minister for the @entity17 gives the impression her job is solely to make life easier for them			1
but @entity0 the bubbly blonde @entity23 presenter is about to become @entity0 the @entity24			1
challenge : @entity0 , 45 , who became mp for @entity27 in 2010 and is the new minister for the @entity17 , said that many of those claiming disability living allowance are not entitled to the benefits she is to slash what ministers say is the most abused benefit in @entity3 , the £ 13 billion a year @entity36 ( @entity36 )			1
from next week , people who apply for @entity36 of up to £ 120 a week are in for a shock : they will be forced to take medical tests to weed out fraudulent claims instead of just filling in a form and getting it for life			1
in her most candid interview since becoming mp for @entity27 in 2010 , @entity0 , 45 , right , tells @entity45 : rising benefit bill : miss @entity0 , pictured in 2002 , said one in 17 of the population will receive @entity36 within five years if the present rate of claiming continues the number of people who get @entity36 has tripled to three million in 20 years and @entity0 says if it carries on rising at the same rate , one in 17 of the population will receive it within five years			1
she says many who get @entity36 and are officially classed ‘ disabled ’ are no such thing : ‘ only three per cent of people are born with a disability , the rest acquire it through accident or illness , but people come out of it			1
thanks to medical advances , bodies heal			1
’ the decision to introduce new tests has produced an extraordinary ‘ closing - down sale ’ effect , with rocketing claims as people rush to get their hands on unchecked ‘ welfare for life ’ before @entity0 ’s axe falls on april 8			1
she says @entity3 simply can not carry on doling out so much in @entity78 handouts			0
@entity0 says @entity3 ’s welfare bill is ‘ a fifth higher than the @entity81 average , over double what @entity82 spends , six times what @entity85 spends			1
we have to have a fair and robust system , but we must make sure the billions we are spending go to the right people			0
’ before becoming an mp , @entity0 helped run her father ’s firm , got a law degree and was a successful tv presenter			1
her first memory of politics is at school			0
‘ i ran my first campaign when i was 11			0
‘ my slogan was ‘ @entity99 , vote the right way			0
i ’ve never surpassed it ! ’ ask her to identify her political heroes and she pointedly declines to name @entity102 , a nod to her @entity11 roots			2
‘ she was n’t a big figure growing up in @entity107 if i ’m brutally honest , ’ she reveals			2
‘ the people i believed in were people like @entity109 , the great philanthropic industrialist – self - made men who realised anyone could achieve			0
my dad started off in scrap metal , real men doing men ’s jobs			0
‘ i ’m not interested in academic backgrounds or who you are connected to , but your character , personality : are you a laugh to be with ? making herself heard : mrs @entity0 pictured with @entity124 while campaigning in 2005 @entity0 continues : ‘ life is about hard work and getting on with things			1
that may be @entity130 ’s background in demolition , if you look how a building is constructed – the foundations , the structure – the interior design is relatively simple			2
’ she is glad she had plenty of experience before entering politics in her late 30s			0
‘ i have come in later and from a male environment			0
you ca n’t get much more male than a demolition site			0
i ’m shyer than people give me credit for , ’ she says , smiling , adding more convincingly : ‘ but i can also tell people to get lost , maybe some others ca n’t			2
’ @entity149 : miss @entity0 said she never married because : ¿ i never met the man , the man ' she gives another fiery flash of her @entity154 pride when i point out @entity155 in @entity107 has the highest rate of @entity36 claimants			1
does that suggest swinging the lead is worse in @entity107 than elsewhere ? ‘ absolutely not , i totally do n’t want that down ! ’ she flares , pointing angrily at my notebook			2
true or not , @entity107 is one of the first areas to be targeted in @entity0 ’s @entity36 crackdown			1
@entity0 has had a series of romances			2
before becoming an mp she dated @entity168 , now a fellow @entity169 minister			0
until recently she was dating @entity169 mp @entity170			0
‘ we ’re still best mates , if that ’s what you wan na know , ’ she says			2
why has she never married ? ‘ you know what ? it was never my key focus			2
i have had long relationships but i have never got married			2
i just thought it would happen			0
i tried and now i think it ’s too late			0
’ what about not having had children ? is it a regret ? she replies matter - of - factly : ‘ no. and i really like children			1
i have very good mates who did very well in business and had this ticking clock and really felt they wanted to get married and have children			1
i was waiting for my clock to tick and it never happened			1
’ why ? ‘ i do n’t know			2
i obviously never met the man			0
’ not one of her many boyfriends ? ‘ no , the man , ’ she says with a husky laugh			1
is she seeing anyone at present ? ‘ no. but i do live with a man			0
and that ’s me dad , ’ she says , retreating behind her @entity198 caricature			0
you sense none of her suitors have lived up to her true hero , demolition man @entity204 .			0

@entity0 , 45 , is taking on the role of minister for the disabled
said she will **pursue** those who bogus claimants of disability allowance
claimed one in 17 could receive allowance within five years if rate continues
*praised* her demolition boss father @entity218 for her political views
said many of those classed as ' disabled ' are not and that ' bodies heal '
also revealed she does not regret not having children and never got married as she ' never met the man '
she is to **pursue** vast numbers of bogus disabled who carry on claiming the @entity36 long after they have ‘ healed ’ .
her political views come from her demolition firm boss father , @entity218 : ‘ you build from the foundations upwards . '
she never married because : ‘ i never met the man , the man . ’
she does not regret not having children : ‘ i was waiting for my clock to tick and it never happened . ’
