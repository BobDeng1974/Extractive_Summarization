it 's not the first place you might think of when booking a ski trip			0
but in sunny @entity8 's @entity7 mountain range , fans of the downward slope can gather for an altogether surreal ski experience			1
just do n't expect soft powder and runs which go on for miles			0
@entity14 resort , which is perched upon the @entity15 peak - the highest point in the @entity17 - offers tourists the chance to hit the slopes @entity8 style			1
a lone skier on a slope surrounded by the dry @entity7 mountain range in north east @entity8 accommodating about 150 guests in timber chalets , the resort offers three - and four - night ski and snowboard packages			1
and for those all important apres ski refreshments - it also boasts the highest pub in @entity8			1
but the major flaw to the ski resort is that it sees very little actual snowfall			0
the mountains are high and dry , and while the area sees the occasional blizzard , it can go as long as a year without seeing a single flake of the white stuff			2
the @entity44 mountains can go as long as a year without seeing a single flake of the white stuff downhill : when it opened the resort boosted tourism , but it was later closed due to a lack of custom instead , the process of snow - making - usually used by ski resorts to supplement natural flakes and extend the season - is employed by resort staff			1
the artificially - made white stuff covers around 1,000m of ski runs for three months of the year during an average winter			2
but this type of snow creates a super-slidey surface , which while being popular with ski races , can be risky for beginners - or indeed anyone other than true professionals			2
it 's also quite an adventure to get there			0
situated 24km above the town of @entity71 and about 212km east of @entity72 , it is only reachable in small vehicles with no trailers in dry conditions			0
snowmaking - used by resorts to supplement natural snow - is employed by @entity14 staff originally established in 1993 , making it the first resort in the area ( there is another one @entity83 in neighbouring @entity84 ) , initially it brought people to this remote area , boosting local tourism			1
but things went downhill and the resort was closed in 2010 due to a lack of custom			0
it was sold at auction in 2012 and reopened in 2013 by local skier and businessman @entity97			0
situated 24km above the town of @entity71 , the resort is only reachable in small vehicles ' i used to go to @entity14 all the time , and i 'm part of this special community of skiers in @entity8 , ' he said at the time			1
while most ski resorts boast hundreds and sometimes thousands of acres , @entity14 's five acres might seem a little poky			2
it also only has one ski lift			0
on the plus a day ticket at @entity14 is 385 @entity8 rand , which is just over Â£ 20 - it 's a steal .			1

@entity14 is perched on @entity15 peak in @entity7 mountain range
area has very occasional blizzards but *relies* on artificial snow making
also boasts the highest pub in @entity8 - *perfect* for apres ski
