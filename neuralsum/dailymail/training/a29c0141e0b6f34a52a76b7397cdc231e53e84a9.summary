by @entity0 she may be a professional rider and former olympian , but sporty @entity2 has no intention of being a hands - off mother			0
despite telling @entity6 magazine @entity5 that her pregnancy came as a complete ' shock ' , @entity10 , who gave birth this morning in the @entity16 royal @entity14 hospital , has been quietly preparing for motherhood			1
now she has left hospital , having stayed just a few hours , finding a nanny will be among her immediate plans , because the @entity22 silver medallist hopes to pick up her eventing career where she left off			1
@entity10 gave birth to a baby girl this morning , but has already left the hospital as she and former @entity28 rugby captain @entity27 , can begin their new life as parents the @entity32 's granddaughter , pictured here with @entity27 , is likely to raise her daughter with the same passion for horses and country pursuits that both her and her husband so love the arrangement is similar to one employed by @entity10 's own mother , @entity41 , herself a keen horsewoman			1
her two children , @entity10 and @entity44 , were cared for by their nanny @entity45 while she and ex-husband , captain @entity46 , pursued hugely successful careers in showjumping			1
but although @entity10 remains committed to eventing , the famously down - to - earth royal is unlikely to be a distant figure in the life of her daughter , and is instead likely to ensure her new daughter enjoys a classic country childhood , complete with ponies and plenty of pets			1
princess @entity41 , pictured with children @entity44 and @entity10 , is also a keen horsewoman and employed a nanny to help her juggle her riding with raising the young royals like most of the @entity62 , @entity10 was raised to love the outdoors and traditional country pursuits the @entity22 silver - medalist has been riding since infancy , pictured here riding @entity68 ' in 1984 she also plans to cook for the new baby , and has used her enforced career - break to brush up on her culinary skills			1
in the same interview with @entity74 , the sportswoman added : ' i have been a bit bored			0
i 'm used to being on the go and active the whole time , and now it 's quite different			2
so , yes , i 'm baking			0
i love cooking and will definitely cook for the baby			0
' new father @entity27 added of her culinary skills : ' she 's a very good cook and cooks me everything			0
i cook too , but i 'm the pudding guy - sticky toffee puddings , chocolate fondants and brownies			0
' i 'm very good at following a recipe whereas @entity10 's good at putting her own twist on things			2
' professional equestrian @entity10 is likely to ensure that her new daughter enjoys a classic country childhood complete with ponies and plenty of pets			2
@entity27 , a former @entity28 rugby captain who comes from a solidly middle class background , is likely to insist on a down - to - earth upbringing for his daughter , and , like his wife , loves spending time outdoors			0
the new arrival is sure to follow suit , and will certainly have plenty of space to run about in : her parents recently relocated to a cottage on princess @entity41 's spacious 730 - acre @entity107 in @entity16			1
the @entity109 estate certainly will provide ample room for @entity111 to play the baby 's grandmother @entity41 will play a large role in her upbringing as @entity27 and @entity10 have moved into a cottage on the @entity117 @entity118 may attend @entity10 and @entity119 ' former school @entity120 in @entity122 , @entity123 the move also means @entity10 can spend more time with her new daughter , because the property also houses @entity10 's horses and is where she trains both her racehorses and her three - day eventers			1
@entity10 competing at the @entity131 in @entity132			0
she has spoken about her desire to get back on a horse as soon as possible after giving birth it will also mean a bigger role for @entity41 - already a grandmother to @entity44 and @entity139 ' children @entity44 and @entity140 - who will be on - hand to dispense advice to her daughter and provide a spare pair of hands			1
the baby 's other grandparents are @entity27 's mother @entity147 , who is a social worker , and his father @entity148 , a retired bank official who played rugby for @entity150 for 10 years until a knee injury ended his career in 1973			2
both are likely to want to play a big role in the new miss @entity111 's upbringing and are already regular visitors to the @entity117			2
and while the new baby will , like her mother , forego a royal title , she is likely to have an education fit for a princess			2
@entity10 herself followed in her uncle prince @entity119 ' footsteps and was educated at @entity120 in @entity122 , @entity123 , a possible destination for the new arrival			1
regardless of education , the newest addition to the royal family will certainly spend plenty of time with her blue - blooded relatives , and will join the rest of the family at @entity174 next @entity175			0
and although her cousin @entity179 will be spending the next few months in @entity6 and @entity180 , the two newest members of the royal family are likely to meet long before that			0
@entity118 's cousin @entity179 will head off to @entity6 on tour with his parents the @entity184 and @entity185 soon , but the newest members of the royal family will no doubt meet before he leaves			0

@entity10 gave birth to a daughter this morning and has already left hospital
has said she plans to pick up her equestrian career as soon as possible
like @entity10 and her *brother* @entity44 , the child is likely to have a nanny
new royal will enjoy an active and outdoor - *orientated* childhood
couple recently moved to princess @entity41 's @entity117
baby may attend @entity10 's former school @entity120 in @entity122 , @entity123
