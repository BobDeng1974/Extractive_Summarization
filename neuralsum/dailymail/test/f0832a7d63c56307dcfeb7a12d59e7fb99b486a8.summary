the @entity1 took more than a year to replace a broken alarm system at the home of @entity4 , it has emerged			1
the alarm failed at the former president 's @entity8 residence in september 2013 and even though the @entity1 bought a replacement system in january 2014 , it took until december for it to be installed - leaving the couple without the protection of a working alarm at their home for 15 months			1
it came despite an agent 's recommendation in 2010 that the alarm , which was installed in 1993 , be replaced because it ' had exceeded its life cycle '			2
the request was denied for an unknown reason			0
the oversight - just the latest in a string of blunders by the agency - was revealed in a report by the @entity28 , which was released on thursday			1
concerns : former first lady @entity30 and former president @entity4 , pictured watching basketball in march , did not have a working alarm at their @entity8 home for more than a year during the time the alarm was out of service , the @entity1 assigned an employee to keep watch over the residence , according to the report , @entity35 reported			1
some inside the agency contended that the agent was not sufficient to replace the alarm system , the @entity42 reported			1
despite the apparently relaxed security measures , there were no breaches at the property , where 90 - year - old @entity4 and his wife @entity50 have lived for more than two decades			1
on @entity51 on thursday , @entity4 said that he and his wife have ' great respect for , and confidence in , the men and women ' of the @entity1			0
' that respect and confidence has never waned , ' he wrote			0
endorsement : in light of the reports , @entity4 tweeted that he had ' great respect ' for the @entity1 property : their @entity8 home , circle , was guarded by a @entity1 agent throughout the 15 months the report also raises concerns about the security at other former presidents ' homes , but has redacted their names			1
among the concerns , one official reported that safety equipment showed ' signs of impending failure '			0
in january , the @entity42 reported that the alarm system at vice president @entity80 's home was failing so agents had simply switched the system off			2
they were told that budget constraints meant the repairs would have to wait			0
the new report , which was addressed to @entity1 director @entity86 , recommended that the agency reviews all security equipment and looks into how it keeps track of maintenance issues			1
' with these fixes in place , we believe the @entity1 will more effectively meet its mission to protect the lives and homes of our former presidents , ' homeland security inspector general @entity91 , who wrote the report , said in a statement			0
blunders : a member of the @entity1 patrols outside the @entity104 last september after a man managed to scale the fence , run across the lawn and enter the property without being stopped embarrassment : last week , a man landed a gyrocopter on the @entity113 @entity112 lawn in the latest embarrassment for security teams in @entity116 , a member of a bomb squad checks out the aircraft @entity86 agreed with the recommendations and said that the @entity1 had launched a review before the investigations			2
the report 's findings are just the latest embarrassment for the @entity1 , which has seen its reputation tarnished by a string of missteps in recent months			0
last year , @entity130 war veteran @entity129 scaled the fence of the @entity104 and managed to enter the residence - running right past agents , who also failed to release a dog in time			2
earlier this year , two agents drove through an active bomb investigation , and last week , a protester flying a gyrocopter managed to land on the lawn on the @entity112 in @entity139			0

the alarm system at the former president 's @entity8 property failed around september 2013 but was not replaced until december 2014
it came after an agent recommended in 2010 that the 20 - year system be replaced but the request was denied
the *details* emerged in a report by the @entity28 released on thursday
the report recommended that the agency reviews all security equipment
