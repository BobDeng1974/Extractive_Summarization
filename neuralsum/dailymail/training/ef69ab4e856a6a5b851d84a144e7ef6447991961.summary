by @entity0 @entity1 , pictured with his daughter @entity2 , was struck down by the rare condition @entity3 after suffering a bout of man flu a teacher who was left paralysed after a bout of ' man flu ' has taught himself to walk again			1
@entity1 , from @entity9 , @entity10 , picked up a runny nose and cough from one of his pupils			1
when he complained about feeling under the weather , his wife @entity15 told him to stop exaggerating his symptoms			1
but within days , the maths teacher 's condition had deteriorated			1
mr @entity1 , 27 , found himself unable to move his legs , and the paralysis crept across his body , rendering him unable to move			1
he slipped into a coma while in hospital , as doctors worked to determine what was causing his body to shut down			1
they discovered mr @entity1 's cold had triggered a rare nerve condition , @entity3 ( @entity3 ) - which normally develops from a virus or infection and affects just 1,500 people a year in the @entity31			1
remarkably mr @entity1 has battled back from the illness , and after re-learning to walk , he is preparing to return to work			1
he said : ' i thought i just had a bad cold - my wife and i even joked it was a bad bout of ' man flu '			1
' it did get quite bad and i went to a couple of walk - in centres , but the staff there just told me i had a virus , so i thought i 'd best man up			2
' normally i 'm a fit and healthy guy			0
i play loads of sport and stay active			0
i very rarely get sick but i turned out to have pneumonia in one lung and then the @entity3 started			0
' i gradually lost all the feeling in my hands and feet , then my legs and forearms			2
' but then it got the point where i was almost completely paralysed			0
i was gasping for air			0
' it was so scary - i do n't even remember a lot of my early time in hospital			0
' the nurses told me it was one of the most severe cases they 'd seen but it was also one of the fastest recoveries they 'd witnessed because i was in such good shape before			1
' the 27 - year - old started to feel ill last october but put his condition down to a cold			1
but within days he was admitted to hospital and slipped into a coma as his immune sytem began to attack his body doctors diagnosed @entity3 , a rare but serious condition which affects the body 's nervous system			1
the maths teacher was forced to re-learn how to walk as a result of the illness his wife @entity15 ( pictured ) suspected her husband was exaggerating his symptoms			1
she said : ' it just sounded like man flu and i thought he would go to work and get over it			2
but then when things started to get worse three days later i had an instinctive feeling that something was n't right ' mr @entity1 began to feel unwell in october 2013 but , as an active dad who lifted weights and played football and squash regularly , he thought one day in bed would be enough to recover			1
but when he had failed to recover a few days later , he decided to take a day off to get back to strength			0
far from getting better , he deteriorated dramatically and within a week of his first sick day he was no longer able to move and was admitted to hospital			0
@entity3 ( pronounced @entity98 ) syndrome is a rare but serious condition of the nerves that control the body 's senses and movements			1
it affects about 1,500 people in the @entity31 every year and is slightly more common in men than women			1
it causes the immune system ( the body â€™s natural defence against infection and illness ) to attack these nerves , causing them to become inflamed			0
the exact cause of @entity3 is unknown , but most people - around 60 per cent of sufferers - develop the condition shortly after having a viral or bacterial infection			2
the symptoms of @entity3 usually develop between one and three weeks after a minor infection			0
they often start in your hands and feet before spreading to your arms and legs			0
initially a person suffering the condition may experience : - pain , tingling and numbness - progressive muscle weakness - co-ordination problems and unsteadiness weakness is likely to affect both sides of the body and gets worse over several days			2
around 80 per cent of people make a full recovery within a few weeks or months , and do not have any further problems such as permanent nerve damage			2
source : @entity141 in order to let his body recover , doctors sedated him and he remained in a coma while his terrified wife waited anxiously for a diagnosis			2
once doctors had ruled out all other possibilities they started pioneering treatment for @entity3			2
they discovered the condition had developed from the pneumonia in one lung , the illness mr @entity1 had labelled ' man flu '			1
just under two months later , he had to start the long road to recovery in rehab by re-learning to walk			2
fortunately , he was one of the lucky sufferers who make a full recovery and since leaving hospital on @entity165 - more than three months on from being admitted - he has gone from strength to strength			1
he is back playing squash , taking his daughter to the park , and will be back teaching later this month			0
mr @entity1 added : ' i missed my first @entity172 with my daughter but had my first day release from hospital for my daughter 's first birthday			1
' wanting to get back to my wife and daughter , and all the kids at school , was such a big motivator to work on the physio in rehab			2
i just wanted to be back to normal and forget the nightmare			0
' my head teacher came to visit me and told me all the kids had been asking after me so i went back to see my classes for a day visit when i came out of hospital			2
' i ca n't believe i 'm going back to work soon - it 's such a relief			2
' mrs @entity191 , said : ' when @entity1 said he had a cold i thought it was nothing serious - it just sounded like man flu and i thought he would go to work and get over it			1
' but then when things started to get worse three days later i had an instinctive feeling that something was n't right			0
' when he started to lose feeling in his legs it was so scary and frightening			0
' i 'll never dismiss man flu again			1
any little thing has me thinking it must be really serious			0
the 27 - year - old has battled back to regain his fitness and is preparing to return to his job as a teacher later this month			1
his wife @entity15 , said : ' i 'll never dismiss man flu again			1
' ' if he says he 's got a headache i get really worried and quiz him : " are you ok ? do you need to get checked out ? is there something seriously wrong ? " ' now he ca n't stop me fussing			0
' consultant neurologist dr @entity217 , an expert on @entity3 who works with the charity @entity218 , said : ' @entity3 is caused by your immune system attacking the nervous system instead of just fighting an infection			0
' we think the damage is due to antibodies reacting with the precipitating infection which causes peripheral nerve damage			0
' in 75 per cent per cent of cases there is a history of infection and that can be caused by either bacteria or a virus			0
' we can normally identify which infection @entity3 developed from in half of all cases			0
' but we do n't understand it completely and we 're not entirely sure what has caused the @entity3 in all cases			0
' there are hundreds and hundreds of infections which are incriminated as triggers although some are more likely than others			0
