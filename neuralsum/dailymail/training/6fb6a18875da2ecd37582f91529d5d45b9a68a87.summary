when @entity1 reinvented the hand dryer , everyone was surprised at how such as a simple concept could work so effectively			0
now one @entity5 - based company is planning to replicate the success of @entity1 's @entity7 , but for the entire body			1
the ‘ @entity10 ’ group has been working on a design to eliminate the use of towels completely by pushing water off the body in around 30 seconds			2
after enough air has been collected , it ’s blasted out from nozzles in the foot plate			0
the arrangement of the nozzles creates a column of air that swirls around the body			2
the air emits negative ions causing water molecules to divide into smaller particles that evaporate faster			0
the device , which is slightly larger than a set of home scales , pushes highly - compressed ionised air up towards the body at various angles			1
the ionic dryer emits negative ions causing water molecules to divide into smaller particles that evaporate faster			0
luckily the temperature can be adjusted to blow warm air on colder days and cold air during the summer months			2
one @entity5 - based company is planning to replicate the success of the @entity7 ( left ) but for the entire body using its body dryer system ( right ) ‘ the idea for the body dryer came after feeling like i was never truly clean after reusing a towel , ’ the creators wrote on their website			1
‘ we looked at the evolution of hand drying systems in bathrooms and saw a natural progression with body drying			0
’ @entity21 is drawn in from outside the @entity10 device and stored in a pressurised chamber , according to a report in @entity64			0
after enough air has been collected , it ’s blasted out from nozzles in the foot plate			0
the arrangement of the nozzles creates a column of air that swirls around the body , providing what the company claims is a more hygienic drying process			1
currently the device only exists as a prototype , but its developers are planning on launching an @entity79 campaign in april to help finance large - scale production			1
if enough funds are raised , @entity10 is expected to sell for $ 250 ( £ 150 )			1
early contributors to the crowd funding campaign will be able to get one for just $ 125 ( £ 75 )			0
currently the device only exists as a functional prototype , but its developers are planning on launching an @entity79 campaign in april to help finance large - scale production			1

body dryer creators said they ' never truly felt clean after reusing a towel '
device claims to be more hygienic and effective at drying the entire body
it blasts ionised and temperature - *controlled* air at body in various angles
@entity5 - based group has a prototype which it plans to *market* for £ 150
