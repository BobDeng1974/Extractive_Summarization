@entity0 are due to release a new version of their hit song @entity4 40 years after it was first recorded an unreleased version of one of the most celebrated songs in rock , @entity4 , is to come out later this year after sitting in the vaults for more than 40 years			1
an alternative take @entity4 , one of @entity0 ’s most famous compositions , will be released on a new version of the band ’s fourth album due out later this year			1
guitarist @entity15 has sifted through vintage studio recordings to find different versions of each of the eight tracks from the @entity21 album - which first came out in 1971 - for a companion disc to accompany the reissue , part of a remastering of the band ’s entire catalogue			1
the soon - to - be released performance of @entity4 dates from a series of mixing sessions at @entity31 in @entity32			1
the version which was eventually released was completed at the @entity35 studio in @entity36			0
also to be issued the same day , october 27 , is a remastered version of the group ’s @entity40 album which again features newly heard takes of seven of the eight songs from that release			1
new editions of the band ’s first three albums came out last month			0
founding members of @entity48 , singer @entity49 and bass player @entity50 - famously reunited on stage in 2007 along with @entity52 , the son of late drummer @entity50 , at a tribute concert for @entity54 , the founder of the band ’s label @entity57			0
the song , one of the most played in rock music history , was initially conceived while @entity0 guitarist @entity15 was staying an @entity63 cottage in @entity64 in 1970			2
the introduction came to @entity15 during the night , and after he played it to @entity49 the pair made a series of cassette recordings which would form the basis for the song			0
however @entity86 , 42 , the owner of the house , says he is fed up with metal enthusiasts disturbing their peace and quiet			0
mr @entity86 says one fan turned up having walked there from @entity92 , eating berries and sleeping in bushes as he went , while another stole the sign from outside his home after he refused to let him in			0
@entity4 has consistently ranked among the greatest rock song of all time in magazine polls , and in the @entity101 alone it is estimated it had been played 2,874,000 times on radio , enough to last for 44 years if run back - to - back			2
it is perhaps not surprising then that @entity15 once called an @entity106 radio station during a charity drive and offered to donate $ 10,000 if they promised never to play the track again			2
the song was also reportedly banned from some guitar shops after staff became sick of hearing people constantly playing it while trying out instruments.the ban was even referenced in 1992 film @entity117			0
in 1982 the song fell foul of the backward masking ' scandal ' , as @entity101 tv stations alleged the song contained hidden satanic messages that could only be heard if it was played backwards			0
among the messages said to be hidden in @entity4 were ' here 's to my sweet @entity126 ' and ' i sing because i live with @entity126 ' , which could allegedly be heard if the lyrics ' if there 's a bustle in your hedgerow , do n't be alarmed now ... ' were reversed			1
according to @entity134 , the song has earned an estimated $ 562million for the band and their record label to date , taking into account sales , royalties and downloads			1
however @entity0 have repeatedly refused to licence the song for advertising meaning the record could be worth far more than that figure			2
advertising experts told @entity145 that , for just one campaign , @entity0 could make around $ 8million , bringing the song 's worth up to $ 570million .			1

@entity0 to release *unheard* version of hit track @entity4
will be on disc with new versions of all tracks from band 's fourth album
to date the track is thought to have earned the group $ 562million
