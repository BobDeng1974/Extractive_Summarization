more than 300 young people in @entity2 were groomed , raped and sometimes forced into ' sex slavery ' by gangs over the last 15 years , a damning report will reveal tomorrow			1
in a scandal startlingly similar to the one in @entity8 , police and social services will be criticised for failing to protect vulnerable children from sexual abuse			1
one gang of @entity13 men was responsible for abusing and enslaving 50 girls , mainly from @entity15 , but the men were also able to sexually torture girls as young as 11 for eight years after a series of missed opportunities to stop them			1
the victims , who were mainly girls under the age of 16 in the care system , were targeted by men from mainly @entity13 gangs who raped , tortured and trafficked them for sex between 1999 and 2014			1
some were abused for up to eight years despite asking for help from the authorities , who instead refused to believe them or blamed them			2
their abusers fed them drink and drugs before taking them to graveyards , a @entity46 and flats rented just for the rape and torture of children			0
according to the @entity53 , one 12 - year - old girl was taken to a @entity55 house for a backstreet abortion during a six - year period where she was passed between groups of men who raped her in what she called ' torture sex '			0
the plight of the victims was laid bare in 2013 when seven members of a sadistic gang were jailed for a total of 95 years for their ' depraved ' and ' evil ' abuse of vulnerable girls			1
five gang members were given life sentences and two others were jailed for seven years for ' crimes of the utmost gravity '			2
the paedophile network groomed more than 50 vulnerable girls in @entity15 between 2004 and 2012 with gifts , alcohol and drugs before subjecting them to extreme physical and sexual violence			1
they used knives , meat cleavers and baseball bats to inflict severe pain on the girls for their twisted pleasure			0
but a catalogue of opportunities to stop the abuse was missed as early as may 2005			0
jailed : @entity90 ( left ) and @entity91 ( right ) were each given a life sentence with a minimum of 17 years at the @entity94 in 2013 for their role in the @entity15 abuse abusers : @entity91 ( left ) , 38 , was given life with a minimum of 20 years for the ' dreadful offences ' he committed against the girls			1
his brother @entity91 ( right ) , 34 , was also handed a life sentence with a minimum of 15 years attackers : @entity91 ( left ) , 27 , was jailed for life with a minimum term of 12 years while @entity91 ( right ) , 32 , was sentenced to seven years in prison on numerous occasions girls told police officers , social workers and care staff in children 's homes how they were raped or seriously sexually abused – but no charges were brought against the gang			1
three of the girls who gave evidence at the trial were reported missing from residential care on 254 occasions			2
paedophile : @entity91 , 28 , was jailed for seven years for two counts of sexual activity with a child and the judge in the case , judge @entity129 , said ' police and social services missed tell - tale signs ' about the abuse that was taking place			1
one social worker had earlier told the trial that ' nine out of ten ' people who were meant to be caring for the girls ' knew what was going on '			2
life sentences were handed to @entity90 , 32 , and his brother @entity141 , 31 , who were both jailed for a minimum of 17 years , @entity91 , 38 , who will serve a minimum of 20 years , his brother @entity145 , 33 , jailed for a minimum of 15 years and @entity91 , 27 , jailed for a minimum of 12 years			0
@entity91 , 32 , and @entity91 , 27 , were jailed for seven years			0
the latest serious case review came weeks after true scale of abuse in @entity8 was revealed , where at least 1,400 girls fell into the clutches of paedophiles , mainly from @entity156 backgrounds			0
whistleblowers who tried to raise concerns lost their jobs , and police officers often did not seem to believe the girls , their families or those who reported problems , and did not treat them as victims			2
one former police officer said : ' they were running scared of the race issue … there is no doubt that in @entity8 , this has been a problem with @entity156 men for years and years			0
people were scared of being called racist			0
' similar paedophile rings were uncovered in @entity173 , @entity174 , and @entity175 .			0
