by @entity0 , @entity1 correspondent the @entity2 is probing astonishing claims gps are billing care homes for visits that should be free			1
fees paid by nursing homes are intended to cover so - called ‘ enhanced ’ services			1
but there are concerns some family doctors are demanding the payments for nothing more than basic @entity2 care			0
a @entity16 peer said if evidence of fraud was discovered it would be a police matter			1
concern : some gps are charging extra to visit care homes over and above their six - figure average earnings , it has emerged in a debate on care in the @entity28			1
the government is investigating the claims ( file photo ) it is believed some homes are passing the cost of @entity23 on to elderly residents , increasing the chance they will have to sell their property			0
around one in ten nursing homes have paid a doctor for a visit , according to a survey by the @entity43			0
it was reported last month that in one case a @entity45 requested an extra £ 24,000 a year to cover services for 72 elderly residents			1
attack : @entity50 , @entity16 's health spokesman in the @entity28 , said the situation appeared to be fraud @entity54 ’s family doctors are already the highest paid in the western world			1
health minister @entity56 has asked @entity58 and the chief inspectors of gps and social care to investigate how widespread the practice is			1
officials will then consider whether action needs to be taken against rogue doctors			0
many family doctors charge a fee for ‘ enhanced services ’ to care homes , but this is meant to cover extras such as training for nurses and carers , or health and safety audits			2
ministers say the payment should not apply to @entity2 care , which should be provided for free whether or not a person is in a home			0
@entity54 ’s gps enjoy an average package of £ 105,000 a year			1
despite their huge salaries , the vast majority took advantage of the stipulation in @entity16 ’s 2003 botched contract that they could opt out of responsibility for their patients outside office hours			2
the issue came to light during a @entity28 debate on healthcare provision to care homes			0
@entity97 , speaking for the government , said : ‘ let me be clear : gp practices should ensure that any services provided to care homes for which a retainer is charged are not those currently provided under their contract with @entity58			0
‘ @entity58 is responsible for ensuring that the terms of the gp contract are being met			0
‘ any gps who provide services should do so free of charge , and any money paid by care homes to practices should be for something over and above that			2
‘ the sort of thing that we might be thinking of is assistance with training or possibly helping out with something like a health and safety audit , but certainly not basic @entity2 care			0
’ inflation : prescription charges are going up again from £ 7.85 to £ 8.05 , with another rise to £ 8.20 next year probe : health minister @entity56 ( left ) said he will task staff to investigate if the practice is widespread @entity131 peer @entity129 asked what the government was doing to prevent ‘ what appears to be double charging ’			1
@entity136 told her : ‘ the department is working with both the @entity43 and @entity58 to get to the bottom of this			2
guidance is in the process of being written and disseminated			0
’ @entity16 ’s @entity142 urged the government to take further action , insisting that to charge for an ‘ enhanced service ’ and not provide anything extra was fraudulent			2
@entity50 , the party ’s health spokesman in the @entity28 , added : ‘ as this appears to be fraud , should n’t this be a matter for referral to the police ? ’ last night @entity156 , a former government adviser on older people , said : ‘ the idea that just because someone is in a care home they should have to pay for @entity2 care is outrageous			1
‘ gps have already got a very good pay deal and they have typically pulled out of out - of - hours			2
it seems utterly wrong to push this cost on to care homes , who will push the cost on to families who are already paying higher fees			0
’ dr @entity173 , deputy chairman of the @entity175 ’s gp committee , said : ‘ all practices provide comprehensive services free of charge to all patients in care homes			0
‘ a very small number of practices receive extra payments … to cover the costs of providing additional services , such as regular ward rounds or assistance with staff training			1
