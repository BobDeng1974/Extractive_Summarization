the creature belonged to a family of extinct hoofed animals called anthracotheres			1
@entity48 is one of six species of anthracotheres found at the site , but what distinguished it from other members of this family was a series of tiny holes on either side of its jaw that held the nerves providing sensation to the chin and lower lip			2
