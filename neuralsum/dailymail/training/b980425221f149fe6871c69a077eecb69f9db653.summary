in the days long before @entity1 was a @entity2 icon , @entity4 captain and a global megastar , he was a scrawny , unproven 19 - year - old earning four hundred quid a week in the @entity6			1
back in february 1995 , sir @entity7 decided the teenager , who had just one first - team outing under his belt , needed to prove his mettle in a man 's game			2
so the young @entity1 was loaned out to @entity14 for a month to gain the necessary experience and show what he could do with that magic right foot			2
@entity1 's contract for his loan spell at @entity14 in february and march 1995			1
the @entity2 teenager was sent to @entity21 to gain experience and earned £ 400 a week @entity1 , then 19 , shows off those famous ball control skills upon arrival at @entity14 in february 1995 @entity1 pictured at a @entity26 press conference in @entity27 this week and , co-inciding with @entity2 's @entity31 fifth round tie at @entity21 this week , the precise details of @entity1 's spell there have been revealed			1
@entity33 , @entity14 's stadium manager , said @entity1 's loan contract is still hanging on the wall of his office at the ground and is a rather unique souvenir of where it all began for the world famous player			1
he told the @entity43 : ' @entity1 played down here on loan and i have his contract on my office wall			1
i was told to get rid of it by a former chairman , but i was sensible enough to keep it			0
' the official @entity53 document shows that @entity1 will play for @entity14 between february 28 and march 27 , 1995 and will be paid the princely sum of £ 400 a week			1
@entity1 went on to win pretty much every major trophy in the game , including the @entity57 in 1999 @entity1 played 115 times for @entity4 , many as captain , and scored 17 goals for his country @entity1 also won the @entity63 title on six occasions with @entity2 but @entity1 was also in line to receive an additional £ 50 for every first team appearance made , plus all his accommodation costs and expenses were to be covered			1
in the end , he played in five league fixtures and scored twice , both in spectacular circumstances			0
one was directly from a corner and the other was one of those trademark free - kicks			0
after a month , he returned to @entity76 , broke into the first team and , well , the rest is history			0
but to think that @entity1 did n't fancy the idea of a loan move			2
' i was shocked , ' he wrote wrote in his autobiography @entity84			0
' i thought it was a sign that the club was trying to get rid of a player			0
' it took some reassurance from @entity7 to persuade @entity1 that the temporary change of scene would forward his career			0
how right he was .			0
