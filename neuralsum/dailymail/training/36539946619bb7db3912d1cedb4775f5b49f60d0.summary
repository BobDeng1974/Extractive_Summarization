by @entity0 published : 08:26 est , 5 july 2013 updated : 20:08 est , 7 july 2013 the idea of holding a hot hairdryer over your brand new trainers might sound bizarre			2
but for those looking for the perfect fit ( and trying to avoid the agonising ritual of breaking in new trainers ) , this is exactly what @entity10 suggests you do			0
the sports brand has brought out the new u-form + trainer , literally the hottest running shoe on the market , designed to shrink - to - fit using heat from your hairdryer			1
the new @entity21 + is designed to ' shrink to fit ' and mould exactly to the individual foot the hair dryer should be held about 10cm away from the shoes for two minutes as anyone who has worn ill - fitting trainers knows , there is nothing like a blister or a twisted angle to sabotage even the most dedicated runner , ad these hi - tech new shoes aim to put an end to these annoyances			1
they look like normal high - end sneakers , but they come with instructions about how to put them under the hair dryer before hitting the treadmill			0
exclusive to @entity43 , the @entity21 + are different from the original @entity21 , which needed to be put into the oven for three minutes			1
the unique u-form + material is inside the shoe , starting in the mid-foot and wrapping around the heel			1
you hold a hair dryer about 10cm away from the shoes , off your feet , for 2 minutes to heat them up , before putting them on and lacing them up tightly			0
the material is secured around the foot by the lacing system , so when it 's laced it locks down around your foot and heel			0
it then ' fits ' round your foot , supposedly giving a perfect fit and improving running performance			2
a button on the heel of the shoes turns bright red when the trainers are at the correct temperature as the trainers cool down they fit to your foot , which is meant to improve performance and reduce the likelihood of injury the original @entity21 trainers go into a preheated oven at 93 degrees @entity75 for three minutes , until the ' u-form ' tab turns red			1
assuming you have n't over-cooked your trainers , they should be warm but not too hot to put on			0
you then lace them up to your preferred tightness and wear them , while seated , for eight minutes			0
as they cool they shrink round your feet , and in the sitting position they should give optimal support to your feet , ankles and leg muscles			2
available in both men and women 's sizes , the @entity91 trainers cost £ 100 , and while some amateurs might balk at spending that on something you might accidentally set on fire , running enthusiasts seem to be willing to go to any length to get the perfect fit .			1
