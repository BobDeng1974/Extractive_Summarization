many of us are very particular about how strong we like our tea and coffee and the same applies to how hot it has to be			2
with this in mind , engineers have created a heated mug designed to keep the temperature ' just right ' from the first sip to the last drop			2
called the @entity12 , the $ 39.99 ( £ 26 ) gadget can maintain the temperature at around 71 ° @entity14 ) for up to 45 minutes - giving you plenty of time to drink it all			1
it can maintain the temperature of hot drinks at between 68 ° @entity24 ( 155 and 160 ° f ) for up to 45 minutes - giving you plenty of time to drink to finish the beverage before its gets too cold the @entity29 principle is a scientific term for when the state of something falls within certain margins , based on the children 's story @entity36			1
this principle applies to the @entity12 and the margins in this case are between 68 ° @entity24 ( 155 and 160 ° f )			1
the mug weighs a little over one pound ( 454g ) and can be charged wirelessly or using a traditional usb cord			1

the team has raised more than $ 48,900 ( £ 32,330 ) of its $ 120,000 ( £ 79,300 ) goal so far and backers can pre-order the mug for $ 30 ( £ 20 )			1
if the campaign is successful , the mugs will start shipping in august this year , after which point they will retail for $ 39.99 ( £ 26 )			1
