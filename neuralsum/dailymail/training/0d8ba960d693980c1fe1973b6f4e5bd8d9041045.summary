goals from @entity2 ’s @entity1 and @entity4 ’s @entity3 put @entity5 into the quarter - finals of the @entity7 at the expense of @entity9			1
@entity11 ’s late flourish in @entity12 , coming from behind to beat @entity13 , saw them put @entity9 out of the competition , despite starting the day top of the group			1
@entity5 had to settle for second place , but they can be encouraged by a much better performance in their final game , capped by a stunning strike from @entity3			1
the @entity5 squad celebrate taking the lead in the @entity27 contest against @entity9 the @entity4 midfielder lashed in the second goal from outside the box to seal the win nine minutes from time , and send the @entity33 fans into ecstasy			1
it was no less than the @entity5 deserved , as they survived the physical @entity37 onslaught far better than either of the other sides had managed so far in this tournament			0
and , with their long - ball tactics producing next to nothing , @entity9 had little else to offer , particularly after @entity45 ’s @entity44 , by far their most creative player , was withdrawn with 25 minutes left to play			2
@entity1 of @entity5 celebrates his goal against @entity9 during their @entity50 clash at the start of play both sides knew they would be guaranteed a place in the quarter - finals with a win , but either could go out if they lost and the result in @entity12 went against them			1
the onus was on @entity5 , with @entity9 only needing a point , and they showed more intensity from the very first minute than they had in either of their first two games			1
inside 90 seconds the @entity5 should have been ahead , @entity65 – playing for the first time in the competition – robbing @entity68 and setting @entity70 ’s @entity69 through on goal			0
the winger , however , with all the time in the world , seemed to panic , and failed to take the ball around @entity9 keeper @entity75			0
@entity76 of @entity5 vies with @entity9 's @entity45 star @entity44 during the @entity27 tie it set the tone for the game , @entity9 ’s defence – so solid before this game – surprisingly off the pace , with @entity84 a constant nuisance			1
and they were punished for a lack of concentration on 11 minutes , an innocuous ball over the top from the half - way line leaving the entire back three standing , as @entity2 ’s @entity1 stole in behind			2
@entity1 , so disappointing in the first game that he was dropped for the second , showed why he had been recalled , controlling nicely before calmly slotting home past @entity97			0
@entity9 , for the third time in the tournament , had to try and come from behind , and they did pose an attacking threat in flashes , with @entity44 playing just off @entity104 ’s @entity103			0
@entity9 's goalkeeper @entity75 makes a save during the @entity107 match @entity103 ’s pace in behind forced @entity110 to charge out of the @entity112 goal to clear on one occasion , while @entity44 ’s trickery posed a threat			2
but the finishing @entity37 was lacking , the @entity45 winger once undone by a bobble on the pitch , and later flashing over after dancing past a couple of defenders			0
their best chance came just before half - time , when @entity124 played in @entity125 as the @entity33 defence switched off from a freekick			0
with time and space inside the box , however , the wing - back took too long to get his shot away , allowing @entity3 to get across brilliantly and make a crucial block			2
even with @entity9 pouring men forward in search of an eqaulaiser it was the @entity33 who looked more likely to score			0
they were only denied a second by a brilliant goal - line clearance from @entity141 , after @entity142 had fired a shot from the edge of the box , before @entity1 wasted a good chance on the break			0
but it mattered little , @entity3 ’s stunner securing the win , and progress into the knock - out stages .			1

@entity5 head to the knockout stages as @entity27 *runners* - up
@entity1 opened the scoring before @entity3 's late strike
@entity9 out after @entity11 beat @entity13 2 - 1 in the other remaining *fixture*
