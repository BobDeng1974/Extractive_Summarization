@entity1 's lawyers have been trying to paint him as a gullible teen who was recruited by his extremist brother to bomb the @entity5 finish line two years ago			1
but today , prosecutors presented the jury with a never - before - seen photo that tells quite a different story			0
seen in the bedroom of his family home in @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity1 sits at a computer chair and points to a black flag behind him - not unlike the kind used by extremist groups like @entity20 and @entity21			2
@entity1 's former best friend @entity22 testified in court on tuesday that he saw the flag hanging in @entity1 's room , the one time he visited the apartment to watch @entity27			1
while the so - called @entity43 or @entity44 has been co-opted by @entity46 extremist groups in recent years , it has much deeper origins in the @entity49 world			0
the @entity50 used a black standard when he fought , which is why it continues to be used as a symbol for modern - day jihadists			0
according to @entity57 master @entity59 lecturer @entity58 , the flag reads : ' there is no god but @entity62 , and @entity50 is @entity63 '			0
she told the @entity64 that the statement is called ' the shahada - the testimony ' which declares one 's belief in the @entity35 faith			0
however , quickly after the picture of the flag was shown in court today , @entity72 district court judge @entity71 ordered taken out of court since he found it ' illegible '			0
assistant u.s. attorney @entity78 said another witness , who did not take the stand today , would be explaining the flag 's significance further			0

he said his brother was very strict , very opinionated , and that since i was n't a muslim he might give me a little s * * * for that , ' @entity22 said			2
defense lawyers opened the trial at @entity131 in @entity33 with the blunt admission that @entity1 had carried out the crimes he is charged with , focusing their hopes on the jury sentencing him to life in prison rather than the death penalty he could face if found guilty			1
they contend @entity113 was the driving force behind the attacks and that his younger sibling followed out of subservience			0

@entity1 asked to borrow it , saying he too was interested in committing a robbery , @entity22 testified			1
