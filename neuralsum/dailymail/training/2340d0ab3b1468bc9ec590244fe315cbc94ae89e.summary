by @entity0 published : 09:24 est , 2 december 2013 updated : 20:13 est , 2 december 2013 court battle : @entity2 , pictured outside the @entity3 , has spent five years trying to get her wedding ring from her ex-husband a woman who was married for nearly 40 years spent five years fighting a legal battle with her ex-husband to recover her £ 550 wedding ring			1
@entity2 has forked out around £ 100,000 in legal fees fighting him over £ 7,000 worth of jewellery including the ring			1
she said she had supported her ‘ unemployed ’ husband , @entity13 , when they met and had even bought their wedding rings			1
the 66 - year - old retired teacher told the @entity3 that she mounted her legal battle to recover her 22 - carat gold ring because she ‘ paid for it and wanted it back ’			0
the couple met in 1966 and married in 1970			2
they separated in 2004 , and although they were briefly reconciled , they divorced in december 2007			0
during their marriage , mr @entity13 had a successful career as a businessman and amassed assets worth around £ 1.5million			1
mrs @entity2 said that in 2007 , just before their divorce was finalised , they signed an agreement splitting their wealth			1
she received two @entity36 properties worth £ 500,000 and the right to reclaim ‘ jewellery ’ from the former matrimonial home			2
but she claimed that her ex-husband was so determined not to hand over the ring and other pieces of jewellery that he ‘ faked a stroke ’ when she went to collect them in january 2008			2
the court heard that last year after a long legal battle , mr @entity13 handed over the wedding ring , which his ex-wife valued at £ 550			1
but her bid to secure the other three pieces of jewellery – a £ 4,000 pair of diamond and sapphire earrings , which she said she also paid for , another set of earrings and a designer pearl necklace – was dismissed by a family judge in november last year			2
mr @entity13 , who is also 66 , denied having the items and was cleared of faking a stroke			2
in the @entity63 , mrs @entity62 criticised the decision as ‘ irrational , perverse and bizarre ’			0
she said that once the ring was returned to her the judge dismissed her argument that she had been ‘ denied access to the former matrimonial home and my jewellery ’			2
mrs @entity2 , who has remarried and lives in @entity72 , @entity73 , said : ‘ it all turned on the wedding ring issue [ and the fact ] my ex-husband gave the ring back to me eventually			1
but that was just part of my jewellery claim			0
’ lady justice @entity81 told mrs @entity2 : ‘ i see force in some of the matters you raise			1
’ but , refusing to grant permission to appeal , she added : ‘ i do not think she has enough ammunition ( to ) have a real prospect of up - ending the judge ’s findings of fact			0
’ dispute : @entity13 separated from mrs @entity2 in 2004 after nearly four decades together urging mrs @entity2 to move on from the dispute , she said : ‘ i would be doing her no service by allowing this appeal to proceed			1
you would be best to try to put it behind you			0
’ outside court , mrs @entity2 said it was a point of principle and not the monetary value of the jewellery that had led to her court fight			1
‘ it was a 22 - carat gold band which i paid for – and i paid for his , ’ she said			0
‘ he was unemployed when we married ; i was supporting us			0
i paid for it and i wanted it back			0
’ mr @entity13 called mrs @entity2 a ' very , very bitter woman ' details of the case were revealed during a hearing at the @entity3 in @entity114 last night mr @entity13 , a retired company director from @entity115 , @entity116 , said : ‘ she is a very , very bitter woman			1
i think she keeps taking me to court because she is bored in @entity73			0
‘ mrs @entity2 cleared out our villa in @entity73 and packed the ring in a box , which then sat in storage for years			1
i discovered it and took it to the court , but she did n’t want it			0
i had to post it to her in the end			0
