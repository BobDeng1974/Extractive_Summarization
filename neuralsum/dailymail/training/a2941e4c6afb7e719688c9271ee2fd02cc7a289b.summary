by @entity0 published : 18:16 est , 25 may 2013 updated : 18:16 est , 25 may 2013 concerns are growing amongst residents of the upmarket @entity3 that their exclusive beaches are set to be overrun by less desirable visitors this summer driven north by @entity7 ’s devastating impact on the @entity8			1
for so long an exclusive enclave for the rich and famous , the group of villages and hamlets which form the @entity12 of @entity13 , @entity14 have some of the most expensive residential properties in the @entity17 last year , a young and rowdy party crowd started regularly showing up at @entity19 in @entity20			0
last year @entity19 in @entity20 was invaded by a young and rowdy party crowd and locals are fearing worse this summer peace and tranquility : residents in the @entity3 are concerned that their unspoilt beaches will be overrun by young party - goers who would typically party on the @entity8 the beach is so exclusive that only cars with the blue - and - white permits of local homeowners can parked in its lot , but the out - of - towners got around this by being dropped off and picked up by buses and vans - at least one was seen flying a pirate flag			1
suddenly locals were faced with over-crowded beaches full of twenty - somethings hauling kegs of beer , out for a good time and not concerned about not fitting in with the local khakis and blue blazer brigade			2
this year residents throughout the @entity3 are bracing themselves for an even greater invasion exacerbated they fear by @entity7 having destroyed the more traditional habitat of this young crowd – the @entity8			1
paranoia is growing that @entity19 and others will be overrun with the type of reckless young party - goers best personified by @entity56 and the rest of the @entity58 and @entity59 from the cast of @entity62 ’s ‘ @entity8 ’ reality show			1
@entity3 locals are increasingly concerned about a growing influx of young party - goers best typified by @entity56 from the reality show ' @entity8 ' @entity3 locals have complained about an influx of young out - of - towners who travel to their beaches via coaches to avoid the rules preventing them from parking by the beach ‘ you do n’t want to come across as snooty , but it ’s about peace and quiet for all of us , ’ said @entity74 , 49 , a registered dietician and a year - round resident told @entity76			1
‘ it ’s not a party scene ; it ’s not what we want it to become			0
’ ‘ with the devastation of @entity7 , ’ she added , ‘ we ’re all a little nervous			0
’ other residents fear their neighbourhood is in danger of losing its identity and in one local ’s words is in danger of ‘ becoming @entity95 during @entity96			1
’ the old money set has already had to endure the arrival of the nouveau riche - most recently @entity99 - with their mega-mansions , corporate planes and over-the - top tent parties , but an even greater fear it seems is this new group of day - trippers hell - bent on having a good time			2
in a bid to see off the packed buses and vans driving through the residents - only parking lot , a weekend ban on allowing parking lot non-resident vehicles longer than 30 feet or carrying more than eight passengers are being considered			2
@entity3 invasion : locals in the exclusive area known for it 's expensive properties are concerned that growing numbers of young people are visiting the area to party and enjoy the beaches ‘ there was a time when you had to be on the inside to be part of the @entity3 , and that ’s not true anymore , ’ @entity20 - based author @entity125 told @entity126			1
‘ it ’s become a tourist stop , and it has lost some of its exclusivity			0
’ meanwhile @entity56 and the rest of the ' @entity8 ' cast where in @entity141 , @entity142 on friday to help open the resort for summer , even if it is still very much a work in progress			1
saws and sledgehammers joined beer and barbecues as a fixture of the first @entity151 weekend at the @entity8 since @entity7 roared through			2
seven months after the devastating storm pummeled large swaths of the shore , the tourists made their way back , though many substituted porch parties for a day at the beach on saturday due to rain that has lingered since thursday			0
speaking on ' today ' on friday , @entity56 declared : ' everyone ’s here and it ’s getting rebuilt			0
' the residents of the @entity3 will be hoping those words will be enough to encourage @entity56 's fellow @entity165 and @entity167 to party at the @entity168 rather than taking a trip further north			0
the cast of @entity62 's @entity8 reunite on the @entity170 at @entity141 , @entity142 on friday			0

@entity173 residents fear their beaches will be over-run this summer by the boozy younger party - goers who typically *frequent* the @entity8
concerns have voiced about the area being turned into akin to ' @entity95 during @entity96 ’
