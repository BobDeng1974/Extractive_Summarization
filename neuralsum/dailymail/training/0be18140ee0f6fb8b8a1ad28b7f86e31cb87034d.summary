so former regulars of the @entity10 in @entity11 might be surprised to see it now has an indoor swimming pool , five bedrooms and eight bathrooms			1
the disused pub has been transformed from a dingy drinking establishment to a luxury home – worth £ 25million			1
luxury : this is the dining room of @entity21 , a £ 25million home in @entity11 which has been converted from a pub rare : the home boasts a roof terrace overlooking the wealthy district of @entity11 conversion : the whole of the building was demolished apart from the old facade of the former pub gone : the popular @entity10 pub was shut down in 2009 and the building is now back on the market cladding : much of the building is now covered in aluminium leaves intended to imitate a nearby @entity40 tree it was closed down in 2009 and sold to developers who began a major renovation project in the style of the @entity46 programme @entity47			1
much of the building was demolished , but the @entity10 ’s original facade – now painted a pristine white – is still part of the @entity52 designed two subterranean levels , more than doubling the site ’s area from 4,200sqft to 9,500sqft			2
they even clad a large expanse of the property ’s walls in 4,080 folded aluminium leaves which mirror the real @entity62 creeper climbing the opposite building on @entity64			1
and while drinkers may have jostled for a seat on a friday night in the old pub , its new occupants will be spoilt for choice thanks to four reception rooms and two roof terraces			0
pool : two new storeys built below ground include a subterranean swimming pool , pictured @entity77 : two of the eight bathrooms contained in the home , which is one of the priciest currently on the market in @entity83 entertainment : the home cinema room at @entity21 , which will cost 250 times the average @entity83 home relaxation : one of four reception rooms in the home ; planning permission was granted by @entity91 despite estate agents ' doubts room with a view : the lucky new owner will be able to look over @entity98 - starred restaurants and luxury hotels keeping fit : the in - house gym is another feature of the extra space built below ground the home , now called @entity21 , still has a bar in the underground part of the building – which also boasts a cinema , gym and swimming pool			1
marketed by estate agent @entity112 , the property is within close reach of 26 @entity98 - starred restaurants and a number of five - star hotels			0
it also includes underfloor heating , a bespoke kitchen and a maid ’s bedroom			0
@entity112 , managing director of the estate agent , said the pub ‘ went downhill over the years ’ , adding : ‘ it is a prime example of what you can do by taking a piece of real estate and transforming it into a fine home			0
‘ it is also a bit of a mystery from the outside , and having a roof terrace is rare – you do n’t see many of these in @entity11			0
’ the £ 25million price tag makes @entity21 150 times more expensive than the average property sold in @entity138 and @entity139			2
fixtures and fittings : the kitchen and casual dining area in the home , located in an area beloved of the international super-rich pastel hues : one of the five bedrooms in @entity21 , designed by architects @entity150 work : a desk and sofa dominate this office space in the home , which could prove a fruitful work environment for the millionaire who buys it going for a dip : the steps which lead into the underground pool below the property suite : another bedroom in the unique property being sold by estate agent @entity112 garden : one of the roof terraces is covered in greenery with a wall of plants and several pots expansive : the home will be perfect for an oligarch looking to settle in to the luxury @entity175 lifestyle chillaxing : the sofa area of the house next to a coffee table and fireplace @entity181 : the radical re-design of the house was praised by planners who said the building was ' striking ' sought - after : the unique property is likely to attract a fierce bidding war from ultra-wealthy buyers			2
