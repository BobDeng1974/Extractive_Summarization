' after seeing the many videos of people acting crazy on @entity53 , we wanted to encourage some human kindness , ' the @entity47 ad read			1
' we thought about selling it , but that just would n’t be in the holiday spirit			0
' @entity4 ’s girlfriend @entity38 came up with the idea			2
' @entity4 had written a book and i was actually the editor for it and just reading the book just really makes you think about what you have and how you can help other people and basically what you put out comes around six-fold , ' she told @entity68			2

' there were 40 or 50 people on the front lawn when it first opened			0
' mr @entity4 said the sale was part of his plan to live the life he preaches , although some have suggested the entire sale was merely a publicity stunt to generate some much - needed interest in his new self - help book ' @entity99 ' , which came out less than a month ago			1
one big clearout : instead of selling his belongings , @entity4 posted on @entity47 that he was giving away his things for free			1
