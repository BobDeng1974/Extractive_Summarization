a @entity1 deep - sea exploration company says it has recovered about 48 tons of silver from a @entity4 cargo ship that was sunk by a torpedo during @entity6 the haul comes from the @entity8 , which was hit by a torpedo from a @entity11 u-boat about 300 miles off @entity13 's coast in 1941			1
it now sits 15,420ft deep			1
salvage firm @entity15 said it is the heaviest and deepest recovery of precious metals from a shipwreck ever made			1
all but one of her 85 crewmen were lost haul : forty - eight tons of silver bullion has been recovered from the @entity8 and returned to the @entity32 but salvage firm @entity15 will keep 80 % after expenses the company is under contract with the @entity4 government and will get to keep 80 per cent of the haul after expenses			1
the remaining 20 per cent will go to the @entity39 so far , workers have brought up more than 1,200 silver bars , or about 1.8 million troy ounces , worth about £ 23.7 million ( about $ 37 million )			1
the company is under contract with the @entity4 government and will get to keep 80 per cent of the haul after expenses			1
the remaining 20 per cent will go to the @entity39			1
@entity8 was steaming home from @entity47 in 1941 while in the service of the @entity50 when she was torpedoed by a @entity52 u-boat			1
she sank in @entity4 waters about 300 miles off the south west coast of @entity13			1
only one of her 84 crew members survived			2
the 412 - ft steamship has remained sitting upright on the seabed with its holds open , nearly three miles under water			1
raised from the depths : a sonar image of the @entity8 on the bottom of the sea eerie : a ladder leads down to the cargo hold on the @entity8 as it lies on the sea bed 300 miles south of @entity68 uncovered : an intact toilet sits on the bridge deck of the @entity8 treasure hunter : the @entity72 , bristling with high - tech equipment , which went looking for and found the wreck of the @entity8 pick - up : odyssey crew used remotely operated vehicles to get to the wreck and unload its precious cargo the ship , recognisable by the red - and - black paintwork of the @entity82 and the torpedo hole in its side , was sailing in a convoy from @entity86 in 1941			1
buffeted by high winds and running low on coal , the captain decided he would not make it to @entity91 and broke from the convoy to head for @entity68			2
a single torpedo from @entity93 sank her in 20 minutes , on february 17 , 1941			1
three lifeboats were launched , but only second officer @entity96 made it to land , reaching the @entity99 coast after 13 days			1
well preserved : a brass part of the @entity8 is in remarkably good condition in an earlier statement @entity15 said the @entity4 government was ‘ desperately looking for new sources of income ’ and was urging it to find more @entity4 wrecks			1
it was also investigating @entity107 , lost off @entity108 with 10 tons of gold in 1694 , and @entity110 , a precursor to @entity112 ’s flagship			2
in 2008 a @entity1 judge ordered the firm to hand back gold and silver coins worth £ 300million to @entity117 , which said the treasure was taken from a frigate that sank in 1804			2
@entity15 said the wreck ’s identity was unclear and had been found in international waters			1
video : see the silver as it 's hauled up from the bottom of the ocean ! ... by @entity127 heroic : second officer @entity96 , the only survivor of the @entity8 during @entity6 , @entity4 , cut off from occupied @entity128 , was utterly dependent on supplies reaching her by sea			1
but @entity132 was determined to force @entity4 to her knees by cutting off these supplies			1
he ordered his @entity136 captains to hunt down and destroy @entity138 shipping			2
in february 1941 alone , 38 @entity4 ships were sunk			1
many of the ships were old and heavily laden , so they could travel no faster than eight knots , making them an easy target for u-boats			2
the @entity8 , with its heavy load of almost 7,000 tonnes which included the silver , as well as iron and tea , was forced to burn more and more fuel to maintain her speed in the stormy seas as they journeyed north			1
fearing that he did not have enough fuel to make it to @entity91 , her skipper , captain @entity158 , asked permission to break away from the convoy and make instead for @entity68 on @entity13 ’s south - west coast , and on february 14 , 1941 , the @entity8 left the convoy			1
the u- 101 , captained by @entity164 , headed towards the @entity8 , hoping to make a ‘ kill ’ , and at 2230 hours a massive explosion blew apart the ship ’s @entity168 hold			1
such was the impact of the single torpedo that the foremast snapped and crashed to the deck , taking with it the radio antennae , so the crew were unable even to send a distress signal			1
they were alone and sinking fast			2
as fire and smoke ripped through the @entity8 , captain @entity158 gave the order to abandon ship and the men made for the lifeboats			1
then bullets ripped through the darkness , forcing them to throw themselves down			2
the u-boat surfaced and sprayed the deck with machine - gun fire			1
some of the bullets cut through the ropes of one lifeboat , sending it crashing into the sea			2
dozens of men leapt overboard and swam towards it , including second officer @entity96			2
they began pushing away from the stricken vessel to avoid being sucked down as it sank , and had to paddle frantically to get clear of the spinning propellers			2
somehow they pulled away and watched as just a hundred yards from them , the @entity8 disappeared under the waves , within 20 minutes of being hit			1
of the other two lifeboats there was no sign			2
they were alone in icy seas , hundreds of miles from land			2
there were 31 men in the lifeboat : eight @entity128 and 23 @entity47 seamen — known as @entity216 — who immediately began suffering badly from the cold , so they were given all the blankets and some canvas for shelter			0
( file picture ) old and heavily laden ships like the @entity8 made easy targets for the deadly @entity11 u-boats the only man skilled at sailing a small boat , was 31 - year - old @entity96 who immediately took command and set sail eastwards , steering with an oar because the rudder had been lost			1
their food supplies consisted of some tins of condensed milk and dry biscuit , so hard it could barely be swallowed			0
@entity96 resisted the crew ’s pleas for extra water rations to soften the biscuit , because they were desperately short of water			0
each man was limited to half a pint of water a day and half a pint a night			0
but the @entity216 began drinking salt water , which made them go mad and fight each other			0
soon , men began dying			0
then , on the eighth day , water ran out			0
there was no sign of land and little chance of rescue : no one knew their fate or whereabouts			0
men become delirious and ‘ had barely enough hope and heart to carry on , ’ according to @entity96			0
a couple of rain showers gave some relief from the thirst that burned their throats , but in the cold air , their hands and fingers became swollen with frostbite , making it impossible to grip the oars			0
over the next few days , their strength and spirit ebbed away			0
gaping : the torpedo hole in the @entity8 , where the @entity136 captain 's log reported the ship was struck but @entity96 , determined , fit and strong , was resolved to save the lives of the remaining men			1
he sailed the little boat through towering waves and fierce gales , snatching little sleep as only he , the @entity8 ’s radio officer , 18 - year - old @entity287 , and a gunner named @entity289 , 20 , from @entity290 , @entity291 , had the strength left to man the rudder			1
then , 13 days after the sinking , with only seven men surviving , many barely clinging to life , one man croaked out the word they all longed to hear : ‘ land ’			0
at first the others thought it was just a cloud , but then they made out a lighthouse			0
it was the @entity305 on the southernmost tip of @entity99 , 300 miles from where the @entity8 had sunk			1
@entity96 began sailing towards a rocky cove			0
just as they were nearing its entrance , a huge wave smashed onto the small boat , capsizing it			0
in their weakened state , all but three of the men drowned — so near yet so far from safety			0
another wave righted the boat and @entity96 managed to drag himself , @entity319 and @entity289 on board , only for another breaker to capsize them again			0
they clung to the keel , but as more waves crashed violently over them they lost their grip			0
@entity319 was washed to his death , but @entity96 and @entity289 made it onto nearby rocks			0
then another icy wave knocked @entity289 backwards , drowning him just yards from safety			0
exhausted and alone , @entity96 felt ‘ the fight for life was not worthwhile ’			0
then , as he surrendered himself to his fate , he heard voices urging him not to give up			0
three young girls , @entity339 , @entity340 and her sister , evacuees from @entity343 in @entity344 , had been walking along the cliffs when they spotted the boat flip over in the stormy seas below			0
one ran across the fields to fetch help from a nearby farm			0
the other two raced down to the beach and shouted to the men , begging them to keep swimming			0
eventually , the first girl returned with a coastguard named @entity356 , who threw @entity96 a rope and pulled him ashore			0
the bodies of @entity319 , @entity289 and two @entity216 were recovered and buried in a nearby cemetery			0
it later transpired that the place where @entity96 had come ashore , at @entity363 , was just a few miles from his home			2
he was awarded an mbe in recognition of his heroic efforts to keep fellow survivors alive , as well as a @entity370 for bravery at sea			0
@entity96 returned to sea just nine months later , and spoke little about it after the war , during his years in the @entity376			0
but the citation on his mbe will forever celebrate the extraordinary efforts of this brave man : ‘ it was only the cruelty of the sea that robbed him of the fruits of his labour .			0

@entity8 was hit by torpedo from a @entity11 u-boat in 1941
wreck lies 300 miles off @entity13 's coast in @entity4 waters , 15,420ft down
this is the heaviest and deepest recovery of metals from a shipwreck
@entity15 is under contract with @entity4 government
the company will get to keep 80 per cent of the haul after expenses
