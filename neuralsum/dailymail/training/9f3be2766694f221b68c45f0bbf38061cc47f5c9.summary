while @entity2 gold medalist @entity1 has admitted to an addiction to @entity4 , no one has detailed the effects of his addiction as vividly as flight attendant @entity7 in his new tell - all memoir : confessions of a @entity10 : true tales and gossip from @entity13			1
mr @entity7 spent 12 years attending to the needs and whims of the rich and famous as a first class @entity10 flight attendant			1
his book documents finding comedian @entity19 and singer @entity20 delightful as they returned from their ' first date ' in @entity23 as ' celebrities do '			1
he said @entity20 was so down to earth she could have been any other passenger			1
then there was the flight where he plied stunning @entity29 singer @entity28 with so much booze she was 's * * * faced ' , which was ' the absolute proof i 'm 100 per cent gay			1
if i was a straight guy i would have taken advantage of her there and then			2
' but it is @entity7 's tale of watching @entity1 and his now ex-wife @entity38 on a flight to @entity40 that is one of the most compelling			1
@entity1 and his manager have both been contacted seeking comment to this story			2
in this extract from the book , @entity7 recalls the flight at the end of 2005			1
it was one of the rare occasions that i was rostered on with both my two close friends , @entity67 and @entity68 – they were working in business and i was working in first class			2
we ’d just come off a riotous thirty - six hours in @entity59 and i was feeling like death warmed up			2
between the heat of @entity59 and the whingeing of the boarding passengers , i wished i could click my heels and be back in @entity78			0
everything was running as it usually did in first – champagne corks popping , canapés flowing and passengers complaining before they even had their seatbelt buckled ! as we settled the precious ones into their seats , there was a buzz from business class			0
@entity90 ’s @entity2 swimming hero , @entity1 , and his singer girlfriend , @entity38 – soon to be wife ; now ex-wife – were seated in @entity94 and @entity95			2
there was general excitement from crew and passengers alike			2
after the first - and business - class passengers were all put to bed , crew grabbed the cheese boards and gathered in the business - class galley on the main deck for our customary goss			1
the light over @entity94 went on and it was @entity38			0
@entity7 's book also tells of the time he met @entity19 ( left ) and @entity20 ( right ) on their return flight from their ' first date ' in @entity23 she handed us a packet of the sleeping sedative , @entity4 , and asked us to please hide it , explaining that they reacted badly with him ; he ’d just taken some			1
thus instructed , we did as she asked			0
about two hours later , i was standing alone in the first - class galley flipping through a magazine when , smack bang , @entity1 came flying out of business class and through the first - class curtain followed closely by @entity67 and @entity68 , who were desperately trying to restrain him			2
' i should be in here , ' he slurred			0
he then stepped towards the front right door and started to unzip his fly			0
eventually , we wrestled him into the toilet ; let ’s just say it was like getting a thoroughbred horse into a racing barrier			1
although i ’d heard that some people had bad reactions to @entity4 – even sleepwalking – this was truly bizarre behaviour			1
@entity1 is slightly shy of two metres tall			0
somehow , when he emerged , we managed to steer him back to his seat ; that was a lengthy struggle			0
minutes later , he was amorously kissing @entity38			0
while we found that amusing , @entity38 was clearly embarrassed			0
we were trying to assess what she wanted us to do when his behaviour suddenly became a great deal more intimate			0
quick as a flash , we removed her from the situation by taking her to the business - class refreshment bar then i raced to get @entity1 some water			2
former @entity2 swimmer @entity1 had to be wrestled to the toilets and his ex-wife handed his pills over to flight attendants so he could n't take any more , according to @entity7 when i returned with the water , he was laughing to himself while hop - scotching over @entity38 ’s reclined seat			1
everyone around him was shocked ; our @entity2 hero off his head on sleeping pills ? of course , years later , his battle with sleeping pill addiction would become public			1
fortunately he settled , and during the breakfast service in the morning he appeared quite sheepish			0
before they disembarked , i quietly slipped @entity38 the @entity4 as she exited the toilet and she thanked me			1
back in business class , @entity1 was looking under his seat and shaking out his blanket			0
when i enquired whether everything was all right , he told me rather abruptly that he was looking for something			0
@entity68 travelled in to central @entity40 on the same @entity170 train as the celebrity couple and reported that @entity1 still looked upset about losing ‘ something ’			0
he must have got over it because @entity67 , who was working on @entity1 ’s return flight to @entity90 , told me it was uneventful			2
