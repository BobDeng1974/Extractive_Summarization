by @entity0 published : 16:10 est , 6 april 2013 updated : 16:34 est , 6 april 2013 tests : @entity2 wants to try out @entity4 drugs on sick patients a sacked @entity7 drugs tsar has been awarded more than £ 500,000 of public money to carry out a controversial world - first trial using ‘ magic mushrooms ’ to treat depression			1
professor @entity2 wants to investigate the way sick patients are affected by a hallucinogenic substance contained in the mushrooms			1
as president of the @entity17 , he has been given the cash by the @entity19			2
the exercise is also backed by shadowy charity the @entity21 , which is run by an aristocrat dubbed ‘ @entity23 ’ and lobbies to liberalise laws on mind - altering drugs			1
but professor @entity2 ’s chances of carrying out his research are being hampered by ‘ archaic ’ @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity32 laws which govern clinical trials and make such drugs illegal			1
he says it is impossible to gain access to the hallucinogen to carry out the trial and is fighting for a change in the law			0
magic mushrooms are , along with heroin and cocaine , defined as potent @entity4 drugs			0
they are known to have a powerful effect , and are thought to have the potential to make some mental disorders worse			0
possession can lead to seven years in jail and an unlimited fine , and some users have complained of suffering flashbacks and paranoia			0
several deaths have been linked to magic mushrooms in recent years			0
previous research carried out by @entity2 on healthy volunteers – which is subject to far less rigorous regulation – found that psilocybin , the active ingredient in the mushrooms , reduced the level of activity in the part of the brain which appears to cause some people to be locked into a continual cycle of depression			2
he now wants to explore whether prescribing magic mushrooms to those with severe depression can , along with regular psychotherapy , improve a patient ’s well - being			0
speaking ahead of the @entity17 ’s festival of neuroscience this week , professor @entity2 said : ‘ finding a company to provide this illegal drug has , as yet , proved impossible			1
‘ so we ’re between a rock and a hard place , which is unfortunate			0
because if this is an effective treatment – which it may well be for some people – then they ’re obviously being denied that possibility			0
dangerous : magic mushrooms are thought to have the potential to make mental disorders worse ‘ one of the things we have to do is have a more rational debate about the way the drug laws are implemented			0
if they ’re actually denying access to powerful tools which could potentially improve human well - being , then they ’re not doing what they should be doing			0
’ professor @entity2 added : ‘ i ’ve spoken to people in @entity7 and we ’re continuing to try to get the @entity32 to understand that the current way the regulations are implemented is hindering research			1
‘ we have an archaic set of laws which were established by the @entity30 in the @entity108 and they ’re inappropriate for modern medicine and modern science			0
’ the academic , who was sacked from his role as the government ’s chief drugs adviser in 2009 after claiming lsd and ecstasy were less harmful than alcohol , plans to dress up in @entity119 costume at the conference to give a talk on whether psychoanalyst @entity123 ‘ was wrong to give up on drugs ’			1
@entity123 argued cocaine could cure heroin addiction – but then became addicted to cocaine himself			0
for the trial , professor @entity2 wants to recruit 60 patients with depression who have failed to respond to two previous treatments			1
half will be given a synthetic form of psilocybin and half a placebo drug			0
under current laws , academic researchers are not allowed to manufacture @entity4 drugs			2
companies that could supply the drugs must have a @entity32 licence but professor @entity2 said this could take a year and potentially triple the cost of the exercise			1
only four hospitals in the @entity145 have a licence to hold psilocybin – and professor @entity2 said the @entity32 refused to tell him which they were			1
supporter : @entity149 said she has been working with professor @entity2 since 1998 the magic mushrooms trial was initiated by a charity that lobbies to liberalise the drugs laws and examines links between illegal dugs and creativity			1
the @entity21 is run by aristocrat @entity156 , who has taken drugs in the past and has said that she considers herself ‘ my own best laboratory ’			2
the 69 - year - old has worked closely with professor @entity2 ’s team , planning the research after providing £ 50,000 for the work			1
@entity156 also recently helped secure separate ethical approval for a study investigating the effects of lsd on the brain			2
this will be carried out by @entity2 and his fellow researchers at @entity172			2
the government ’s current drugs tsar , professor @entity175 , was criticised for having links to the @entity21			2
his profile appears on the foundation ’s website along with those of other members of its advisory panel			0
however , @entity156 said professor @entity175 had not carried out any work with the foundation since his appointment as chair of the @entity189 in 2010 and was not advising the charity			1
she has been campaigning for 20 years to investigate the therapeutic potential of illegal drugs and has been involved in a collaboration with @entity194 in the @entity195 to use psilocybin to treat nicotine addiction			2
yesterday she said : ‘ we have an ongoing association with the research team at @entity172 and i ’ve been working with professor @entity2 since about 1998			1
how else can you lessen the harm for people with post-traumatic stress , depression and addiction , and discover the benefits of drugs like lsd and psilocybin ? but good things are beginning to happen			0
