by @entity0 published : 07:34 est , 12 november 2013 updated : 08:23 est , 12 november 2013 an increasing number of elderly people are renting properties after selling their own homes , new data has revealed an increasing number of retired people are selling their homes and moving into rented accommodation in a desperate bid to access cash , experts say			1
overall , there has been a seven per cent increase in the number of tenants aged 66 to 70 moving into rented homes after selling their own properties			1
in addition , half of all regions in the @entity23 saw an increase in older tenants downsizing to rented homes in the past year			1
experts believe many pensioners are being forced to sell up to release equity from their homes as their pension pots dwindle and living costs continue to rise			1
and , figures compiled by @entity34 suggest pensioners have no choice but to downsize into rented homes as suitable alternatives are being bought by younger first - time buyers with the help of @entity41 initiatives			2
@entity42 and @entity43 have seen the largest increase in tenants over the age of 65 , while the @entity47 has the highest rate with 3.1 per cent of pensioners living in rented accommodation			1
' pensions are n't providing the same level of contributions they were 30 or 40 years ago , ' said @entity55 , director of sales and marketing at @entity34			0
' for many elderly people , the only equity they have is in their homes and they 're having to unlock income from other sources like selling their houses			2
' ' the government are specifically only helping one demographic ... new houses are being built for younger people			0
' while some elderly people may be forced to sell their homes and downsize to save money , others may be moving in to rented accommodation as they feel their ' money may outlive them ' , says mr @entity55			1
' a lot of the new homes are n't suitable but another thing to consider is that is pensioners could be taking a short - term view and using their equity to provide a standard of living they 're used to			2
' the @entity34 october 2013 @entity80 breakdown reveals how the price of renting has increased less over the past three years ' it appears the demographic of the @entity23 tenant is changing			1
while initiatives , such as the build to @entity90 scheme , are positive moves to alleviate supply , the government needs to consider these purpose - built properties are not going to be suitable for all , ' added mr @entity55			0
' therefore , focus must also be kept on the maintenance of existing properties , so all tenants are able to live in suitable properties depending on their individual needs			0
' ' momentum must be maintained though so those living within the private rented sector are offered the best quality properties and security needed as part of their tenancy agreements			0
' the report also revealed that though the cost of renting has decreased by 4.6 per cent during the month of october to £ 815 , tenants across the board are still paying 2.7 per cent more on average than last year			1
when comparing previous years , this month ’s figures show from october 2010 - 2013 , average @entity23 rents increased less each year , after rising by 4.8 per cent in 2011 , 3.1 per cent in 2012 and 2.7 per cent in 2013			1
this is also true in the capital , where the rate of increase in average rents slowed down by 2.3 per cent between october 2011 - 12 and four per cent between october 2012 - 13			0
the @entity47 , @entity121 and the @entity122 were the only regions where rental costs increased , with properties in the @entity122 costing 4.5 per cent more to rent than last year , and those in the capital almost 21 per cent more than in 2010			2
' our new figures could suggest the effect of the economic downturn in @entity132 is beginning to reduce , ' said mr @entity55			0
' there ’s certainly more confidence within the housing market at the moment and an increasing amount of first - time - buyers are now purchasing their own properties as a result of increased lending and mortgage availability			0
' ' recent reports suggest the build to @entity90 scheme will improve the private rented sector by boosting the supply of buy - to - let homes within the market			0
' properties rented with longer - term tenancies as part of this scheme aim to not only offer additional security to tenants and their families , but also curb spiralling rents recorded over the past few years			0

number of elderly tenants increased in more than half of @entity23 *'s* regions
seven per cent rise in those leaving their own homes for rented property
experts claim some pensioners are forced to sell homes to release equity
report shows average @entity23 cost of renting currently stands at £ 815 a month
