@entity1 side @entity0 have been attempting a rather unorthodox way of placating travelling fans - by offering them free tickets and local delicacies before games			1
last sunday , around 600 supporters of away side @entity8 were treated to white wine and grilled cheese with pickles from the @entity13 region in @entity14 where @entity0 are based			1
and it must have worked in some way as the home side went on to win 3 - 1 , their third victory in five home games			0
a board of cheese and wine , much like that had been offered to away fans by @entity0 @entity0 's tourbillon stadium in @entity14 in july , @entity0 sent out the following press release : ' @entity13 has a reputation for acceptance and friendliness			2
we want to honour this image and make a step in your direction , in the spirit of sport and fair play			0
' the move is the idea of club owner and president @entity39 , who has become somewhat infamous for his regular disposal of managers - sacking 28 of them during his 10 - year reign at the club so far			0
but , despite the show of good nature , he also added a layer of threat to away fans at the end of the press release , saying : ' and if it does n’t work out , then i ’ll close the away stand after the winter break			0
' @entity0 's owner @entity39 came up with the idea in an attempt to prevent crowd trouble some @entity8 fans , however , were clearly not won over by the idea , setting off flares in the away section of the tourbillon stadium			1
but in a home game in august , fans of @entity64 went even further , when about 1,000 of them chipped in 10 swiss francs each per head - approximately the same cost of a ticket - and gave the collection back to @entity39 with the message : ' @entity71 ' , translating as : ' we wo n’t allow ourselves to be bought			2

@entity0 offer away fans free tickets and local delicacies to curb crowd trouble
