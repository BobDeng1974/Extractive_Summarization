click here to see the full @entity2 stats package from the @entity4 clash at @entity5 so it was n't the quiet night @entity7 wanted			1
with the @entity4 back on the agenda , @entity9 's manager expressed his wish for ' something less eventful ' than last month 's drama against @entity14			1
what he got was anything but			0
though there was no epic penalty shootout on this occasion , the spectacle was no less enthralling as @entity9 managed to extricate themselves from a bleak position against 10 - man @entity22 , turning a 1 - 0 deficit into a 2 - 1 win in injury time			1
and it was thanks , in no small part , to @entity30			2
for once , @entity9 's enigmatic striker came up trumps when it was required , finding himself in the right place at the right time to convert a searching @entity37 cross , seven minutes after coming on as substitute			1
@entity30 was only on the field 16 minutes in total but that did not stop him becoming a key figure in the narrative , even managing to get involved in a jostling match with @entity44 after @entity45 had risen highest at the back post to score the winner			1
@entity9 defender @entity45 roars after his injury - time header sealed a 2 - 1 win against @entity22 in the @entity4 @entity30 came off the bench to score @entity9 's equaliser from @entity37 's cross in the 86th minute lovren heads in the winner unmarked in the 95th minute of extra time to send @entity9 through to the quarter - finals @entity30 posted his delight on @entity58 after breaking his barren spell with a crucial goal in front of the home fans @entity22 winger @entity63 scores the opening goal in the @entity66 fourth - round clash at @entity5 never far away from controversy , @entity30 has an argument with @entity44 in front of officials at the end of the game @entity9 : @entity73 6 , @entity74 6 , @entity75 6 , @entity45 6.5 , @entity76 6 , @entity77 7 , @entity78 6 , @entity79 5 ( @entity80 6.5 ) , @entity81 7 , @entity82 7.5 , @entity83 6.5 ( @entity30 7 ) subs not used : @entity85 , @entity86 , can , @entity87 , @entity88			1
scorer : @entity90 ' , @entity45 90 ' @entity7 6 @entity22 : @entity91 7.5 , @entity92 7 , @entity93 7 , @entity94 7.5 , @entity95 7 , @entity96 7 ( @entity97 7 ) , @entity98 7.5 ( @entity99 ) , @entity44 8 , @entity100 6.5 , @entity101 7 ( @entity102 ) , @entity103 7			1
subs not used : @entity105 , @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108			0
booked : @entity109 , @entity95 , @entity94 , @entity93 ( sent off ) scorer : @entity103 65 ' @entity111 7 man of the match : @entity44 referee : @entity115 7 att : 42,582 @entity7 , for good reason , was sheepish as his players celebrated in front of the exultant @entity119 , appreciating that his side had benefitted from the harsh sending - off of @entity93 for a robust challenge on @entity81 , that led to the free - kick from which @entity45 scored			1
in the other technical area , @entity125 – @entity7 ' former captain at @entity22 – was incandescent at the decision ; that his side had frittered away a place in the last eight after looking set to cruise through following @entity63 65th - minute opener added salt to the wound			1
for @entity7 and @entity30 , however , this was a welcome change of fortune			1
a second defeat to a team wearing all - white at @entity5 in the space of week , after @entity139 's brutal lesson in the @entity140 , would have set the alarm bells ringing but , perhaps , this is what they needed			2
' that is @entity30 , ' said @entity7 ' assistant @entity145			1
' he is working hard and he got his just rewards			0
he nearly missed the game because he felt his knee in the warm up , so it was a good thing we had him			2
but i never thought we were out of it			0
i thought we were unfortunate to be 1 - 0 down			2
' @entity111 , unsurprisingly , did not agree			0
once they overcame a sluggish start , @entity22 , inspired by @entity44 's drive , determination and use of the ball , impressed in the second half and should have taken advantage of @entity9 's frailities when @entity63 put them in front			1
' i am disappointed at the end , ' said @entity111			0
' hopefully ( referee @entity115 ) will rescind the red card			0
these decisions are happening , we have to take it on the chin			0
the players are upset with the decision , upset with the goal but we should have taken that into extra time			2
' we should be clever enough to deal with that			0
we did n't deserve that			0
i 'm not talking rubbish , i 'm talking sense			0
i was emotional at @entity179 , i 'm emotional again but it is not getting me anywhere			0
i watched it about 30 times before i came into talk to you			0
i hope he will rescind that			0
' even if @entity115 does , it will be scant consolation			0
@entity22 were so close to repeating the trick they pulled at this stage of the competition two years ago and only naivety cost them			2
until then , they had coped with everything @entity9 had thrown at them			2
@entity9 's play in the opening period was nice enough but lacked punch and only @entity37 looked capable of breaking the deadlock ; he had the two best efforts , one with a left - foot drive that fizzed past the post , the other forced a fine save from @entity91			1
injured striker @entity204 signs autographs for fans as he makes his way around @entity5 ahead of the game @entity30 ( centre ) was left out of @entity9 's starting line - up as @entity7 made nine changes to his side @entity9 defender @entity213 posted a @entity58 selfie with team - mate @entity215 ( right ) at the game @entity78 - battling for the ball with @entity22 's @entity44 - was handed the captain 's armband for the first time @entity81 ( r ) was @entity9 's liveliest player during the opening exchanges as the @entity222 attacked the @entity5 half under - fire @entity9 forward @entity30 smiles as he watches the first half unfold from the substitutes ' bench new signing @entity79 reacts after slicing a shot from @entity78 's neat through ball well wide in the opening half @entity22 forward @entity101 in an aerial duel with @entity9 defender @entity45 @entity236 forward @entity37 comes close to making a breakthrough for @entity9 in the first half but shoots narrowly wide former @entity9 midfielder @entity44 ( left ) forces a save from @entity73 in a rare attack for @entity22 during the first half @entity22 midfielder @entity44 returns the applause from @entity9 fans as he goes to take a corner @entity30 warms up before the start of the second half wearing a pair of customised boots inscribed with ' @entity248 ' click here to read @entity251 's take on @entity30 breaking his barren spell and his spat with @entity44 at @entity5 part of @entity9 's problems in recent weeks has been how they have lost their way in games when things have not gone as they would have wanted them to , so this was going to be a test of their character as much as anything else			1
a sense the tide was turning arrived on the hour when , from another precise @entity44 corner , @entity266 wriggled away from @entity45 and thumped a header straight at @entity73			1
it was a sign of things to come			0
moments later , @entity44 again started driving @entity22 forward but when his ball was cut out , @entity95 latched on to it and ushered it forward into the path of @entity63 , who had taken full advantage of the fact @entity45 had gone to sleep			1
with plenty of time and space , @entity63 took gleeful delight in thumping a volley beyond the exposed @entity73 to send the visting hordes wild and push @entity7 and @entity283 to a place were they had to begin considering the impact of what defeat would have on their season			1
then came the grandstand finish			0
@entity289 , on for @entity83 , came good , turning in @entity37 's cross before one final attack culminated with @entity45 peeling off at the back post and turning in his header , atoning for his earlier mistake			2
@entity7 afforded himself a small smile but nothing more			2
they are into the last eight and his ambition to win silverware is intact			0
it is n't getting any easier			0
