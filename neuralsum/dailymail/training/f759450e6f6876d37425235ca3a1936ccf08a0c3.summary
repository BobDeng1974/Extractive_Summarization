' it was a very cruel situation you put her in			0
she was a vulnerable woman 1,000 miles from her close family			0
you should not have deceived in her in that way			0
' only two people know what happened that afternoon she is not here to tell us			0
you have told lie after lie about a number of matters making it impossible to rely on what you say			2
' the state of her body was such dr @entity167 , the pathologist , could n't even determine the cause of her death			0
your injuries were caused by her desperate attempts to save herself			0
at first , he denied killing her but later claimed he had ' lost control ' after she threatened to ' expose him in the community ' ' it may be that you formed the intentions to do what you did as long as ago as when you bought the incinerator			1
' you are a very devious , controlling man and a meticulous planner in a number of aspects of your life			1
by the day itself you had sorted out what you going to do			0
' killing her was dreadful enough but what followed was horrible even beyond imagining			0
' you behaved in an unbelievably casual and callous way with a complete lack of any humanity			0
' no one who was in court to hear that evidence will easily put out of their minds the image of her body being poked and prodded by you down into that incinerator			0
' her death and manner of her death has had a profound effect on her family leaving a gap which can not be filled			0
' police noted nothing suspicious when they first visited the couple 's home in @entity29 , @entity30 but returned when they saw smoke rising from the garden @entity19 noticed a burning smell , but @entity1 told them he was just ' burning some rubbish ' during the trial , @entity1 had claimed his wife had threatened to ' out him ' to the community			1
the @entity219 employee said he had realised he was gay at the age of 12 but felt unable to tell his parents the truth because they would be ' devastated '			0
he told the jury : ' she started saying that she had found out about me			2
she said " i have found out that you 're gay "			2
' i was shocked , i did n't know how to react			0
she said " i 'm going to leave you , i 'm going to tell everyone			0
i 'm going to expose you to the community "			0
' ' after that everything happened so quickly			0
we started to fight and i was trying to plead with her not to tell anyone ' i did n't want anyone to know about my sexuality because i knew there would be a lot of issues surrounding that			0
i still wanted to work the relationship out			0
a 22 - inch deep incinerator like that @entity51 used to burn his wife 's body ' it happened so fast			2
we ended up on the bedroom floor			0
there was scratching going on			0
then all of a sudden i lost control			1
' the court heard two police officers found the charred remains of @entity253 in the incinerator on september 13			2
prosecutor @entity255 said : ' a @entity256 lifted the lid and found herself looking down on a human skull which was severely burnt			0
' pathologists later confirmed the human remains were @entity2 's and that she had died from strangulation by a metal pole being placed across her throat			2
during the trial the jury were shown @entity127 images of @entity51 filling up a water bottle with petrol at a service station just hours before his wife 's remains were found			1

in the videos , the couple were seen having their photos taken together and then joining hands to dance alongside a crowd of people			0
after the verdict , @entity2 's cousin @entity287 said : ' no words can truly express the sadness and hurt my family and i are experiencing at the loss of @entity253 , she was loved dearly by all , she had a great passion for life and doted on her family			2
' @entity2 attained a masters degree and was driven to make her life a success , unfortunately she fell prey to @entity1 who had ulterior motives which @entity2 would not have appreciated			0
' detective chief inspector @entity132 , from @entity303 , said : ' @entity1 got married as a matter of convenience - he tricked a poor innocent girl into marriage but was living a lie			1
' when she uncovered the truth he could not live with it and killed her quickly then tried to dispose of her body and her possessions by burning them			2
' had another day passed before police attended , @entity51 may well have successfully removed all traces of @entity253			0
' i hope that this verdict brings some comfort to @entity2 's family who have travelled from @entity14 to see justice is brought for their daughter			1
