respect for officials may not always be at the levels the referees would hope , but @entity4 seem to have taken it further than most during their game against @entity7 on tuesday			2
' @entity4 ' players were in the middle of a startling comeback win , and held the momentum with five minutes to go having just equalised through @entity12 , when referee @entity13 halted the game to get treatment			1
@entity13 left the pitch , thinking he had stopped play , to receive medical attention and eventually be replaced by his fourth official			2
@entity4 players continue to play against @entity7 , despite there being no referee on the pitch the players looked genuinely surprised when they were pulled back after the lack of official was pointed out @entity13 did n't realise the players were continuing as he left the pitch to receive treatment @entity13 blew his whistle and gestured angrily to halt the play , before being replaced by the fourth official after a short stoppage @entity13 was replaced , before @entity4 went on to win the game with a late goal however , the @entity4 stars took no notice , continuing to attack with no referee on the pitch , until the official , rather angrily , had to forcefully bring the move to the end with several short blasts on his whistle			1
eventually the men in purple realised what was going on and stopped so that @entity13 could be replaced , in an incident similar to @entity49 's injury during @entity51 's win over @entity52 this weekend			0
however , the stoppage did little to interrupt @entity55 's side , as just moments later @entity56 scored a header to put them in front and secure a superb come from behind win			0
@entity12 headed in @entity56 's cross to level in the 83rd minute against @entity7 @entity56 scored the winner for @entity4 with a header in the 89th minute			0

referee @entity13 had to be replaced in final five minutes
@entity4 did n't notice the stoppage , tried to continue playing
angry official finally *managed* to halt proceedings , before being replaced
