a wonderful opportunity is opening up for @entity1 over the next few weeks			1
at last , he can play where he has always wanted			2
it ’s very unfortunate that @entity4 is injured for @entity5 and @entity6 is out for @entity7			1
for @entity1 , though , these circumstances have presented him with the chance to establish his credentials			1
for both club and country , it is all finally coming together for the 23 - year - old striker			1
he also did well down the centre for @entity7 against @entity33 last month by scoring twice and now he has two games coming up against @entity35 and @entity36 , when you would expect him to score more goals			2
by the time he comes back from international duty , his confidence should be sky - high			2
there is a parallel to be drawn between @entity1 ’s development and @entity6 , who also always craved the central position but was confined to wide roles at @entity47 and @entity48			1
only when @entity50 gave him his head in the centre at @entity53 did we really see how good he is			2
@entity54 must be as delighted as @entity5 boss @entity55			1
now the @entity7 manager has a growing number of attacking options			2
when @entity6 is back , maybe he will consider pairing him with @entity1 and playing @entity60 behind them , as @entity60 has been doing for @entity62			1
with @entity63 as well , @entity7 look strong going forward			2
@entity1 celebrates with @entity64 after scoring twice for @entity7 against @entity33 he could use it as an opportunity to usurp @entity6 for his country it is probably right that @entity6 is not part of this international squad			1
if he was n’t fit enough to be on the bench for @entity53 on saturday , then he probably is not fit to play a significant part against @entity35 and @entity36			2
had he been on the bench in the 2 - 1 win over @entity76 , i would have probably taken a different view			2
when it ’s international week , the clubs have to abide by that			2
but communication between the @entity82 and clubs over injured players is much better than when i was @entity7 manager and brought in @entity85 , who is now a full - time physio with the national team			0
i understand medical staff went to @entity53 to discuss @entity6 ’s fitness and he is a week or so away from returning			0
@entity1 ’s performance on wednesday was very different from the past			1
then , when he had time to linger on a chance , he seemed to struggle			2
an example that stands out was at @entity93 against @entity94 last season when he tried to lift the ball over keeper @entity97 at 0 - 0			0
it was a wonderful chance to take control of the tie and yet @entity97 simply plucked the ball from the air			1
even last month against @entity47 , he hit a good early chance wide			2
but on wednesday , he was clinical even when he had time to think			0
part of that is clearly his confidence			0
he has a manager who believes in him and he is responding			0
but it ’s also because he ’s playing in better areas that are suited to his game			0
i love the way he runs off the back of defenders and stretches teams with his pace			0
he could n’t do that on the flanks			0
wide players do so much work they are almost like full - backs and because he is so hard - working and disciplined , he covered miles in that shift			0
@entity5 's other senior striker @entity4 remains absent for the foreseeable future @entity1 was criticised at @entity62 for not being clinical enough in front of goal at times the downside of such honesty is that he is not in the areas where he is most dangerous			1
now he ’s making darting runs in areas of the pitch that hurt the opposition			0
but i also think that he is the right player in the right team , by which i mean he suits @entity5 ’s style			1
they will create chances through the middle , they do n’t go down the wings that often and send in crosses			0
though i like @entity4 , he thrives more off crosses , while @entity1 seems more suited to their natural game			1
he appears to be a missing link for them and gives them another dimension			0
now , if you ’re playing @entity5 and you want to squeeze up the pitch , maybe to protect a lead , you certainly have to be careful because he can get in behind you with his pace			1
of course , sunday ’s match comes a real test against what looks to be the best defence in the @entity161			2
@entity48 have the meanest and most solid back four			0
but if @entity1 can stretch @entity163 and @entity164 and find some weaknesses , then he really will go into international week feeling he really is in the best form of his life			1
@entity55 was a hugely important manager in my career at @entity170 but there is one thing that has puzzled me about his @entity5 teams in recent years			1
at @entity170 he was very clear about how we would play			0
we had two strong midfielders in @entity176 and @entity177 : solid players who were fierce in the tackle			0
they were good players but they also made sure our back four were protected			0
when he went to @entity5 , he did exactly the same with @entity182 and @entity183 , and then @entity184			1
@entity55 watches on during an @entity5 training session on saturday @entity55 used to prefer players in the mould of former stars @entity182 ( left ) and @entity183 which is why i ’m scratching my head a little when i see the players @entity194 selects in midfield these days			1
last march , in that infamous 6 - 0 loss to @entity48 , he played @entity197 , @entity198 and @entity20			0
they ’re all fine players but none of them is quite like those midfielders he used to favour			0
when i played , the full - backs did n’t bomb on as much as they do now , so now there is even more reason to have a shield in front of your back four			0
there are different kinds of holding midfielders , those who can play the ball out and those who will scrap for you			0
@entity197 is more of the former , and @entity216 more of the latter			0
maybe when @entity55 brought @entity216 back to the club last season , there was recognition that they he had got the balance wrong			1
@entity216 will play today because @entity197 is injured , and it will be fascinating to see whether he can make a difference to @entity5 ’s vulnerability against @entity48			1
@entity227 will be the centre of attention on sunday against his former club			1
he has been outstanding since he came back but there is another player who has been just as good and is not as lauded			0
he brings balance and solidity to @entity48 and their improvement is as much to do with his arrival in january as the more celebrated signings , such as @entity227 and @entity240			1
@entity227 will be the centre of attention when @entity48 face @entity5 @entity234 ( centre ) in action for @entity48 against @entity245 on plaers @entity247 ( left ) and @entity248 when you talk about a midfielder in the mould of @entity182 and @entity183 , then @entity234 is your man			1
he has that same rangy ability to tackle , the height to give you some presence and an ability to pass well			0
perhaps @entity55 will feel a little wistful watching him at @entity258 .			1

@entity1 has a wonderful opportunity opening up over the next few weeks
@entity5 striker now has a chance to establish himself as a centre forward
@entity55 's change in *tactics* have been puzzling in recent years
@entity227 will be centre of attention at @entity258 on sunday
@entity234 is from same mould as @entity182 and @entity183
