this scenario seems to support the @entity7 government 's assertion - contested by some @entity10 - that the killings were done by one person , since they would have been perpetrated over a longer period of time than assumed when @entity22 staff sgt. @entity2 was detained march 11 outside his base in southern @entity10			1

@entity7 investigators now believe that @entity26 walked off his base that night and killed several people in one of the villages , then went back to the base			1
the @entity7 officials , who are privy to some details of the investigation , said they do not know why @entity26 returned , how long he stayed or what he did while there			2
