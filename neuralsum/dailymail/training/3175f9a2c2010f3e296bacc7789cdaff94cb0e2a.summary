by @entity0 and @entity1 she has survived three brain haemorrhages , each of which could have killed her			1
despite stunning doctors by cheating death , @entity5 continues to live with a ticking timebomb in her head , which threatens to claim her life at any moment			1
the 20 - year - old suffers from an arteriovenous malformation ( @entity14 ) , a rare mass of abnormal blood vessels , that can haemorrhage at random			1
@entity5 , 20 , has already had three brain haemorrhages and could have another one at any moment miss @entity5 , from @entity18 in @entity19 , was seven years old when she suffered her first brain bleed			1
four years later the second struck , followed by the third haemorrhage when she was 16			1
but despite living at risk of suffering a fatal brain bleed at any moment , miss @entity5 refuses to let her condition affect her life			1
she said : ' sometimes i ca n’t quite believe how lucky i am - i know that to survive three brain haemorrhages is pretty remarkable			1
' a lot of people would have a permanent disability , but i ’m fortunate to have no lasting damage			1
' the hope is that through the treatment i ’m receiving from the incredible people at the @entity34 in @entity35 , the @entity14 will shrink and disappear completely			2
miss @entity5 ( pictured with her boyfriend in hospital ) has an abnormal mass of blood vessels in her brain which can haemorrhage dangerously without warning miss @entity5 ( pictured with her brother , @entity42 ) had her first haemorrhage when she was seven			1
she had her second one four years later and her third one when she was 16 ' it ’s amazing to think that one day i might not have to live with this			1
' i try not to think too much about the risks of what i ’m living with as i ’d just scare myself - there ’s no point living in fear			0
' thanks to the @entity52 i live just like any other girl my age - i go to uni , i have friends and an amazing boyfriend - i owe everything to them really			0
' i just try not to focus on my condition , and get on with my life			0
' an arteriovenous malformation in the brain is a tangle of abnormal blood vessels			1
normally , arteries carry high pressure blood and veins carry lower pressure blood but in an @entity14 blood is diverted directly from the arteries to the veins			2
they can cause brain haemorrhages , seizures , headaches and difficulty with movement , speech and vision			1
brain @entity79 occur in less than one per cent of people - they are more common in men than women			2
it is not known why they occur but patients are usually born with them			0
treatment options include surgery and radiosurgery			0
source : @entity91 miss @entity5 was just seven years old when she collapsed on @entity92 , having had her first subarachnoid haemorrhage			1
she said : ' i do n’t remember much of it as i was so young , but all of a sudden i was totally unable to move my arms and legs			0
' i was rushed to hospital , but after a few tests and investigations i was discharged			0
' my parents were really worried as they were sure that something more was wrong			0
' four years later , while at school , ms @entity5 was struck down with another bleed			1
she said : ' i was n’t really able to comprehend what had happened or the seriousness of the situation			0
' but again i remember waking up and not being able to use my legs			0
' i was at the @entity34 for two weeks - at first i was treated with suspected meningitis but then a consultant sent me for a ct scan			0
' it was that that they discovered i had an avm about 5cm by 5cm just millimetres away from my brain stem			2
it was a shock to everyone - we just had no idea			0
' miss @entity5 was told that she would be monitored twice a year , and would undergo gamma knife radiosurgery to reduce the size of the @entity14			1
but the condition struck again the day before miss @entity5 's high school prom			1
she said : ' i ’d had my nails and tan done and was in the shower when i experienced a sudden sharp pain			0
miss @entity5 ( pictured with her brother , @entity128 ) has , amazingly , not suffered any long term brain damage following the brain haemorrhages that she had suffered so far miss @entity5 ( pictured with her stepmother and baby sister ) is now hoping doctors will be able to shrink the growth to prevent her having another bleed ' it felt as though someone had hit me on the back of the head with a shovel			1
' the next thing i can remember is looking down at my hands and seeing my nails had grown out and my tan was patchy where the tubes and drips were			0
' i cried and cried when i realised i ’d missed my prom			0
' this time i underwent a surgery called endovascular surgery , but i lost the ability to walk or see properly - i could n’t even do basic things			2
' it was like my brain just did n’t want to work properly anymore , and i was warned that in 50 per cent of cases it could be permanent			1
' it was pretty terrifying but the @entity34 staff helped me to walk and see again			0
miss @entity5 ( pictured with her brother , @entity42 , and sister , @entity163 ) says the abnormal blood vessels are too close to her brain stem to enable surgeons to operate miss @entity5 said : ' sometimes i ca n't quite believe how lucky i am - i know that to survive three brain haemorrhages is pretty remarkable ' ' thanks to them i was out of hospital within a few months and starting college - i really owe my life to them			1
' ms @entity5 's @entity14 is still present , but so close to her brain stem that it makes open brain surgery impossible			1
she continues to be monitored at the @entity34 , and hopes the radiosurgery will continue to shrink the @entity14 until it disappears altogether			2
she said : ' i try not to let my @entity14 and what it could do affect me - i ’ve known about it from such a young age so i ’m used to the idea now and i feel normal			0
' the only symptom i get is migraines but it could be a lot worse			0
' i ca n’t go too crazy on the rides at @entity184 , and i have to be a bit careful if i go on nights out - but apart from that i ’m a normal university student			0
miss @entity5 ( pictured with her grandfather ) said : ' i try not to think too much about the risks of what i 'm living with as i 'd just scare myself - there 's no point living in fear ' ' i just have to stay positive , and one day hope that i can put all this behind			2
' i ’m fortunate to have an incredible family , boyfriend , and group of friends that keep me positive			0
' consultant neuroradiologist dr @entity200 of the @entity34 said : ' a brain arteriovenous malformation ( @entity14 ) consists of abnormal connections between arteries and veins			2
' they appear in the brain as tangles of blood vessels and are usually diagnosed following a scan after someone feels ill with symptoms such as headaches or a seizure			1
' in serious cases the blood vessels can rupture and be the cause of a disastrous bleed in the brain , known as a brain haemorrhage			1
miss @entity5 is pictured with her family			2
@entity222 to @entity128 , stepmother @entity221 , brother @entity220 , sister @entity163 , brother @entity224 , brother @entity42 and father , @entity226 ' @entity79 are still considered to be maldevelopments of cerebral arteries you are born with			0
' at the @entity34 brain @entity230 are treated in a range of ways including open neurosurgical operations , endovascular embolisation , stereotactic radiosurgery or a combination of these treatments			2
' endovascular embolisation is a minimally invasive treatment using microcatheters through the arterial system to block of the arteriovenous shunts with special glue			0
' miss @entity5 is raising money for the @entity34 who have helped her throughout her treatment			2
you can help herby sponsoring her at @entity248 , or text @entity249 to 70070 .			0

@entity5 , 20 , has a mass of abnormal blood vessels in her brain
these can haemorrhage at any time leaving her with a ticking timebomb
had her first bleed when she was seven and her second four years later
she had her third one when she was 16 and could have another at any time
amazingly , she has not been left with any permanent brain damage
she is now hoping doctors will be able to shrink the growth to prevent her having any more haemorrhages
