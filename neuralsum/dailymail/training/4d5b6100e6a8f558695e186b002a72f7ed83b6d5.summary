there have been a host of big - money signings arriving in the @entity3 for the top teams this summer with @entity5 , @entity6 and @entity7 just to name a few			1
but there has also been shrewd business done from the likes of @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 , sides that will all be looking towards the top half of the table			1
below is the top ten players that could take the @entity3 by storm this season			0
early evidence suggests @entity22 is the class act @entity24 hoped they were getting			0
he 's scored twice this summer and has already excited fans with his array of tricks			1
but the 23 - year - old marries graft to his craft and the @entity34 international promises to be a fan favourite on @entity36			1
he operates in the territory just behind a frontman but drifts across the park picking passes			0
he also boasts a thunderous right boot for a player who is slight of frame and is a deadball specialist			0
@entity13 bid £ 8million for him only last summer and view this signing as a major coup			1
@entity24 wanted to sign the @entity34 striker , who scored 102 @entity58 goals in 309 games , but he snubbed them for a move to @entity61			0
the 29 - year - old scored twice in pre-season and is expected to form an exciting partnership with @entity65 , assuming @entity13 keep the @entity66			2
technically , @entity50 is a powerful and moderately quick striker who has an excellent finish and is good in the air			1
he is likely to play up front in a new 4 - 4 - 2 formation , or ahead of @entity71 and alongside @entity65 in a 4 - 3 - 3			2
powerful : @entity50 has already impressed for new side @entity13 during pre-season @entity73 @entity74 ( right ) club : @entity76 joined from : @entity77 cost : £ 4million made an immediate impact in his first appearance in @entity82 's testimonial , catching the eye with the ferocity of his tackling			1
such has been the way he has settled in , manager @entity87 said it seems as if he has been at @entity90 for ' three years '			0
it will take time for him to adjust to the @entity3 and he does have @entity93 and @entity94 to get past in the battle for a midfield place but it is worth remembering @entity87 opted for @entity74 rather than pursuing a move for @entity100			0
will provide energy and bite as @entity76 compete on four fronts			0
talented : @entity73 has already been praised by his manager for how quickly he has settled into life at @entity76 @entity45 club : @entity106 joined from : @entity107 cost : £ 10.9m the @entity108 has arrived in the @entity3 as a virtual no - one , but the fact @entity111 made his signing one of his acts as @entity106 manager tells you how highly he is thought of by his new manager			1
the left - footed forward cultivated a reputation in @entity119 during his time with @entity121 and more recently @entity107 as a flamboyant and tricky winger			2
but it is @entity45 's strike rate that will catch the eye			2
he has scored 32 goals from left - wing over the previous two seasons in @entity119			2
the @entity129 may have just found themselves a player with the x-factor to help them forget about the summer 's mass exodus			1
prolific : @entity45 has scored 32 goals from the left - wing during the past two seasons in @entity119 @entity135 club : @entity14 joined from : @entity137 cost : loan @entity139 may have struck gold in the transfer market yet again with the capture of @entity135			1
the right - back was a star of @entity147 's exciting @entity146 campaign that ended with that heartbreaking penalty shoot - out defeat to @entity149			1
his boundless energy up and down @entity147 's right side was a feature of the @entity154 's play earlier this summer , and with @entity139 planning to switch to a 3 - 5 - 2 formation next season , @entity135 's engine will be vital for @entity14 as they look to consolidate their top - flight status			1
quality : @entity135 was a stand - out performer at the @entity146 for quarter - finalists @entity147 @entity46 club : @entity12 joined from : @entity164 cost : £ 3m @entity165 has secured quite a coup in signing this graduate of @entity168			1
@entity46 , a forward or winger , broke into the @entity164 first team aged 17 and won three liga titles and two @entity172 crowns before his star faded			1
now 23 , he remains a beguiling presence on the ball , two - footed , capable of drag - backs and dribbles , but has been criticised for not finding the net often enough , scoring just four in 24 games as he won the @entity179 on loan at @entity181 last season			2
for @entity164 , he got 41 in 162 games			0
but he has three pre-season goals for @entity12 and should be given a prominent role			1
back on track ? @entity46 could prove to be the signing of the summer after signing for @entity12 @entity189 club : @entity191 joined from : @entity192 cost : £ 10m that head coach @entity193 admitted he had never seen the @entity195 international striker play should not unduly worry supporters			1
@entity191 's set up leaves recruitment predominantly to the hierarchy and the 25 - year - old was scouted extensively			1
he is a physical presence up front and comes with a good record of 33 goals in 74 matches for @entity205 in the @entity207 top - flight			2
he might take a while to reach peak match fitness having surprisingly missed out on the @entity195 @entity146 squad and failing to appear in pre-season as wrangles over his work permit were ironed out			0
presence : @entity216 could prove to be a key player for @entity191 this season @entity218 club : @entity220 joined from : @entity221 cost : £ 7m @entity222 long identified his striking options as needing fresh impetus and tracked @entity218 all summer before the clubs eventually struck a price			2
the 6ft 3in @entity227 cost @entity220 a club - record fee and will provide a muscular focal point for attacks , an aerial threat , and be a willing runner in behind defences			2
he scored twice against @entity220 in a 4 - 1 victory for @entity221 that seemed to cement @entity222 's pursuit			1
question marks arise because @entity218 has never played in the @entity3 while only one of three seasons at @entity240 was in @entity241			0
he grabbed his first two @entity220 goals in a pre-season victory over @entity244			0
step - up ? @entity218 scored 16 goals for @entity247 side @entity221 last season @entity249 club : @entity251 joined from : @entity252 cost : £ 2m experience has been the byword for @entity255 this summer and in @entity257 the @entity251 manager has that			1
at 26 , the athletic left - back has already played in leagues in @entity261 , @entity34 and @entity262 and spent last season on loan at @entity265			2
it is fair to say he was not a favourite at @entity269 , appearing just 19 times , as @entity271 converted from the right to get in ahead			0
nonetheless , @entity249 does have plenty of attributes needed by @entity251 , including power , pace and strength			0
he has one @entity34 cap from 2010 and cost @entity52 £ 12m from @entity279 in 2009			0
all smiles : @entity257 will be hoping to hit some form for @entity251 after a lacklustre spell at @entity265 @entity283 club : @entity285 joined from : @entity286 cost : £ 7m very leggy , athletic but strong and he makes penetrating forward runs off the ball and seems to be all over the pitch			0
imagine @entity291 – and , on first look , he 's a bit like that			0
@entity285 will be very happy if he 's anything like that when the season kicks off ! plays with his head up , likes to open his body and run at opponents			1
he 's not the finished article and , when he becomes that player , he might not be at @entity285 for that much longer			0
enjoy him while he is there and the @entity285 crowd took to him against @entity307 at the weekend			0
there was even a @entity310 flag around the ground and he responded as the best player on the pitch			0
now for @entity314 next week … athletic : @entity283 was very impressive for @entity285 when they played @entity307 at the weekend			0

while big - money buys @entity5 and @entity6 have caught everyone 's attention this summer the likes of @entity50 and co could also be big hits
the signing of @entity46 was a real coup for @entity165 ' @entity12 side
@entity135 also looks to be an excellent signing for @entity14
