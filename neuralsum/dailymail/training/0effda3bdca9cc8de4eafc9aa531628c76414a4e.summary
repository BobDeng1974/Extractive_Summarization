he added : ' we would like to see every complaint against doctors accessible on the internet , with the caveat stating that it is merely an accusation			0

an @entity107 panel banned him in september from carrying out circumcisions for two years , but said to suspend him from working as a mental health doctor would ' deprive the public of a competent psychiatrist '			2

the @entity26 has said it previously tried to impose an automatic ban for doctors , particularly those on the sex offenders ' register , but after consulting with a top lawyer was advised it would be incompatible with human rights legislation			1
@entity185 , chief executive of the @entity26 , told @entity45 : ' for serious convictions , we will now always call for the doctor to be struck off the register			2
' we are also seeking powers to remove doctors from the register without the need for a hearing , if they have committed very serious offences , which we believe these are incompatible with practising as a doctor			0
' we currently do not have a right of appeal against panel decisions when we believe they are too lenient			0
