engineers from @entity1 and @entity2 are used to going head - to - head on the @entity5 race track in order to give drivers the best chance of taking poll position			1
but the two racing thoroughbreds are now competing in bobsleigh and skeleton events at the @entity13 too as they have both built cutting - edge equipment for athletes representing their home countries – @entity17 and @entity18			0
@entity19 applied the same technologies used in the @entity5 world to improve the aerodynamic efficiency and structural integrity of the sleighs , which will give the @entity26 team a competitive edge at the @entity28			1
aerodynamic : @entity19 applied the same technologies used in the @entity5 world to improve the aerodynamic efficiency and structural integrity of the sleighs , which will give the @entity26 team a competitive edge at the @entity28			1
here , @entity34 pilots a sled in a practice run the @entity37 bobsleigh consists of a main hull , a frame , a front and rear axle and two sets of runners			2
the hull , also known as a cowling , is constructed of fibreglass and made of two separate sections			0
the hull is mounted on four runners that each must be made of a single solid piece of steel			0
no plating or coating is allowed and it is not permitted to warm up runners or use any substance that improves sliding			0
at the start of the race , the temperature difference between the runners and the reference runner , which is exposed to the open air for one hour before the start of the competition , must be no greater than plus or minus four degrees @entity65			0
a bob may have a cowled front end but must be open at the rear			0
push bars protrude from the hull at the start of a race			0
those for the second and third man in the four man event must be retractable			0
each bobsleigh has a brake that can only be applied at the finish			0
braking during the race means automatic disqualification			0
dr @entity80 , director of performance at @entity19 , which is based in @entity82 , @entity83 , told @entity84 that the building of the sleds is about making sure they are designed and made as well as possible to achieve little gains rather than a revolutionary new design			2
this is because the rules governing which materials are used and the components of the sled are strictly controlled by the @entity13 body and any incremental improvements are top secret			1
‘ in essence we have made both sleds work better and have made them more adaptable - rather than necessarily having radically altered the shape or design of particular components , ’ dr @entity80 said			2
the company has been involved in the design of the equipment from the @entity108 @entity13 and has gathered vast amounts of data as well as helping the athletes have input into the design so they can use it easily			2
the @entity37 bobsleigh consists of a main hull , a frame , a front and rear axle and two sets of runners			2
it has to be made to suit strict rules and key principles to make a good sled ( pictured ) are applied by engineers the pressure is on for the sleds to perform well as this year ’s @entity26 team contains @entity130 leader @entity129 , who topped the standings in both runs of the women 's skeleton heats yesterday			1
unlike in @entity5 , skeleton sleds and bobsleighs need to be heavy so that they gain speed downhill , but at the same time they must also be light enough for athletes to manoeuvre			1
there is a sweet spot that leads to optimal performance that also complies with strict regulations			0
‘ @entity2 have built the bobsleigh for the @entity18 team so , as you expect , this has given the team at @entity1 an added incentive to produce the goods for @entity37 , ’ a spokesman for the company said			1
@entity151 : teams of engineers used a wind tunnel ( pictured ) and computational fluid dynamics tools to reduce the drag of sleds and hone their aerodynamic bodies , which are made largely of carbon fibre and steel @entity129 ( pictured ) was the fastest in the field during the heats of the women 's skeleton on day six of the @entity164			1
@entity1 said that @entity37 athletes are the only ones to use a sled that is completely tailor made for them			1
before , they used one size of sled for men and women to engineer the perfect sleds , experts at @entity1 first collected lots of data by fitting test sleds with a range of sensors to understand their strengths and weaknesses - essentially looking at how to make them go faster			1
engineers analysed handling data , as handling directly influences speed and looked at unwanted vibrations that hamper good contact between the ice and the sled			0
they then worked to tweak the designs of the bobsleighs and skeleton bob to tailor them to athletes and enhance their performance			0
this process included an evaluation of all aspects of design - ranging from materials to aerodynamics - using simulators to identify changes that could make all the difference when it comes to setting a fast time			1
data capture : @entity1 has been involved in the design of the sleds ( pictured ) since the @entity108 @entity13 and has gathered vast amounts of data as well as helping the athletes have input into the designs data : @entity1 fitted test sleds with a range of sensors , enabling engineers to understand how to make them go faster			1
design : the company enhanced the standard design of the sleds to make performance improvements tailored to each athlete			1
they looked at the materials used , aerodynamics and handling capabilities using computational fluid dynamics and a massive wind tunnel			0
set - up : engineers built adaptability into the designs for the sleds , enabling them to be configured specifically to suit athletes and tracks , rather than relying on a standardised design			2
manufacturing : the sleds are hand built and the company has used suppliers it also uses to build its f1 cars			2
it managed the assembly of sled components with attention to detail not seen before by @entity37 training : @entity1 worked with athletes and coaches to help them learn how to maintain the sleds and understand how to make the best of technological improvements			1
the company has sent two engineers to the games to iron out any technical glitches			0
dr @entity80 said : ‘ for the bobsleigh , we wanted to optimise the speed and manoeuvrability of the sled so that athletes can get a better line and therefore go faster			0
‘ to do this we made computer models and fed in lots of data			0
we then ran cycles , in the same way that we do for @entity5 , to find tiny improvements – and when we did , created parts to test			1
’ teams of engineers used a wind tunnel and computational fluid dynamics tools to reduce the drag of sleds and hone their aerodynamic bodies , which are made largely of carbon fibre and steel			1
the @entity5 company managed the manufacturing and assembly of sled components , helping to bring @entity5 techniques and attention to detail to the sports , which have in the past used old equipment			1
‘ in the skeleton , we are the only country with a completely adjustable approach			0
before there was just one size of sled for men and women , which was not ideal , ’ dr @entity80 said			0
‘ every component of the @entity37 sled is adjustable compared to other countries we have real attention to detail			2
the quality of manufacturing is also really important			0
’ each sled is hand built in comparison to the @entity37 ’s previous sleds , which @entity1 described as ' pretty poor ’			1
dr @entity80 said : ‘ the team used to buy second hand sleds and by the time they were modified by different people – some good and some poor – over time , they were less effective			2
if we only made the sled well , it would have already been much better			0
’ cool runnings : @entity1 thinks that @entity37 is ' definitely ' capable of bagging a gold medal in @entity317 and that they have ' a good chance ' in bobsleigh			1
the @entity164 run is illustrated , which usually has three uphill sections to slow the sleds down going for gold : to engineer the perfect sleds , @entity1 first collected lots of data by fitting test sleds with a range of sensors to understand their strengths and weaknesses - essentially looking at how to make them go faster at the @entity13			1
@entity129 is pictured on a run during the women 's skeleton heats @entity1 managed the manufacturing and assembly of sled components at its factory ( pictured ) helping to bring f1 techniques and attention to detail to bobsleigh and skeleton , where old equipment has been used in competitions in the past ‘ the design is very strictly governed by the rules and all teams use the same components			1
in that way it ’s similar to @entity5 as the @entity354 and @entity5 governing body dictate closely what we can do and we try to make incremental gains , ’ she added			1
one of the key ways to make a sled quicker is to improve the way that it takes corners and it is where fractions of seconds can be won and lost			2
@entity1 has worked with athletes in training to figure out how to maximise the impact of technological improvements made to the sleds			1
dr @entity80 said : ‘ we spend a lot of time at the beginning of the cycles getting athlete feedback and with the alteration of any important detail			0
some tweaks might mean a slight change in control , but once athletes learn to adapt they will go faster and we can show them this using a simulator			2
’ factory fresh : @entity1 has worked with athletes in training to figure out how to maximise the impact of technological improvements made to the sleds at its @entity83 - based factory ( pictured ) built to last : each sled ( pictured ) is hand built in comparison to the @entity37 's previous sleds , which @entity1 described as ' pretty poor '			1
here , @entity17 's two - man bobsleigh pilot @entity34 ( front ) , uses a new sled during a training session at the @entity28 the company uses simulations so that athletes can train in virtual environments when they are not anywhere near an icy run – which is quite often in the @entity26			2
videos of tracks can be used to gather data and athletes are involved at different stages of changes to their sled ’s performance			0
dr @entity80 said the competition is a little like @entity5 on ice , ‘ but the outcome is hugely dependent on the athletes – even more so than in @entity5			0
in the @entity13 , the athletes are at the centre of it all as we hope we ’ve helped them as much as we can			0
’ she thinks the @entity37 is ‘ definitely ’ capable of bagging a gold medal in @entity317 and that the athletes have ‘ a good chance ’ in bobsleigh			1
the company uses simulations so that athletes can train in virtual environments before taking to a real ice run			0
here , members of the @entity17 bobsleigh team practice ahead of the @entity164			2

@entity1 applied the same technologies used in the @entity5 world to improve aerodynamic efficiency and structural integrity of the team 's new sleds
@entity440 *explained* how it makes tiny design tweaks to make the sleds faster within strict sporting rules in a top secret process
@entity1 used huge wind tunnels and computer simulators to test changes
