i hope when you were sitting at home in front of your tellies looking forward to the latest instalment of the @entity6 vs @entity7 show that you remembered all important thing : this classic managerial match - up is no capital club sprint , it ’s a @entity11 derby marathon			1
and yes , it might well have been entertaining to see the pair - one dressed as a clown , say , and the other a superhero - having it out on the streets while @entity18 and @entity19 told us some fascinating facts about historical landmarks			1
perhaps they can do that next year ? this year , instead , once the actual race was run , all roads led to the @entity27 and a @entity29 team all set to act as pacemaker for the afternoon			2
@entity31 has a look in the direction of @entity34 during the stalemate at the @entity27 and , yes , of course they did bother to point out that there also happened to be an important game of football going on			1
one with the added factor of @entity42 happening to be the man in the middle , on a couple of levels			2
but surely there was never any doubt which two men were going to set the tone for what was about to come			2
having just made it sound like some kind of @entity54 vs @entity55 match up , in fact both bosses were far from being in a combative mood in their pre match interviews			1
@entity7 was nigh on glowing about @entity62 ’s ‘ creative team ( with ) amazing , fantastic solutions			1
’ while @entity66 said one of the important motivators for his team was ‘ to share positive emotions with our fans			0
’ it sounded like someone had just broken out the joss sticks in the tunnel			0
perhaps a little more in - your - face were the pundits in the booth			2
here @entity79 ‘ as an @entity62 man ’ @entity78 found himself getting mildly bad cop / bad copped by @entity81 and @entity82 over the former @entity85 striker ’s contention that ‘ it was kind of weird to see ( @entity42 ) in a blue shirt ’ and that ‘ if i was the boss i would tried to buy him back			1
’ but this really was just everyone jostling for position at the starting gun			0
the race was yet to be run			0
in the first half of the encounter , it was the penalty shouts that saw the director scrambling , to switch to @entity100			0
the first image was a beauty , capturing both men together on the touchline after @entity105 and @entity106 had collided			0
@entity105 and @entity106 collided with the @entity108 man taken to hospital for a suspected concussion in the foreground , @entity34 dispensed with the pre-game purple prose and was using an entirely different vocabulary to berate the fourth official			1
while in the distance , @entity31 looked on with the benign countenance of a man who perhaps thought he ’d got away with one ? each was then given their own live hero shot			1
@entity7 was simply stoney - faced for his , by the time the camera had found him after the @entity42 yellow for an adjudged dive			1
but @entity66 ’s solo was much more dramatic			0
a handball shout against @entity125 rejected , the @entity62 boss had by now donned one of his famous zip up coats and was captured in glorious slo - mo			1
his arms raised in the natural position for a man exclaiming ‘ how was n’t that a handball ? ’ back in the studio at half time , @entity79 looked just as surprised as his old boss had , as he exclaimed ‘ two ? wow ! ’ when @entity81 said he thought @entity108 had a pair of good shouts from twelve yards			1
however , not for the first or last time he revealed his true colours when he admitted he thought there had indeed been one for the west @entity11 team			0
‘ i was showing my @entity62 side earlier ’ , @entity78 confessed			1
in his case , proverbially holding his hands up in the box			0
@entity81 , @entity78 and @entity82 chew the fat after the final whistle into the second half , and on co-commentary @entity151 made the point very early that @entity62 would be happy ‘ in their quest to finish second ’			1
and it became pretty clear pretty quickly that there were in fact two teams out there who ’d take one point each			2
all of which meant the spotlights reserved for any @entity66 and @entity7 fireworks were left dimmed throughout			0
we did n’t even get any awkward gaffer - on - gaffer action at the final whistle			2
instead , just the sight of @entity34 disappearing down the tunnel with the draw tucked away inside his voluminous coat			1
and @entity170 securing the right to be last image in the show with his enthusiastic shadow - boxing celebration			2
indeed , by the time @entity29 had tracked down both managers back in the tunnel , it had reverted to the pre-game chill out zone they had created before kick off			0
reporter @entity180 ’s attempt to get the @entity108 manager to bite only proved that @entity7 just was n’t that hungry			1
‘ i have no comment ’ , he continued to reply , his face impassive throughout			0
instead , we got a maths lecture on the points position at the top of the table			0
and a description of @entity170 ’s performance as ‘ from the moon			0
’ @entity34 patrols the touchline as the @entity108 boss saw his side take another step toward the title someone had clearly relit those joss sticks , because @entity66 too failed to take the bait when his head to head to @entity7 was broached			1
‘ it ’s not about me , it ’s about my team and my club ’ , he smiled , before deftly acknowledging an excellent @entity108 side without also paying dues to his opposite number			2
so in the end , both men effectively breasted the tape together ( although they were n’t exactly holding hands in the process ) , finishing equal first in this particular one			0
something @entity29 spotted early on was the deal , and very wisely chose not to try too hard to shoehorn in melodrama where none existed			0
and why should they ? after all , everyone will be back next year for more of the same			2
so what ’s the rush ?			0

@entity31 and @entity34 faced off once more as @entity62 and @entity108 *contested* a 0 - 0 draw
neither boss was in a combative mood before the game despite some fiery match - ups between the pair in the past
@entity62 manager yet to record a win against the @entity235 in *13* meetings
the point is another significant step for @entity108 in their *inevitable* march toward the title
@entity34 hits out at ' boring ' *criticism* as he claims 11 - year title wait for @entity62 is the real *tragedy*
