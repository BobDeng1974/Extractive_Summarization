from breathtakingly clear shots of brittle stars and vivid sea sponges , to the intricate , yet delicate skeletons of coral , one photographer has managed to document the beauty of @entity8 reefs in exquisite detail			1
@entity11 - based artist and designer @entity10 took the shots during dives off the coasts of @entity17 beach , @entity18 and @entity19 on the island of @entity21			1
she used macro lenses and strobe lights to capture the extremely close - up images and is planning to use them as inspiration in her design studio , @entity27			1
@entity11 - based artist and designer @entity10 captured the close - up shots , including this star encrusting coral , during dives off the coasts of @entity17 beach , @entity18 and @entity19 on the island of @entity21			1
encrusting corals grow on hard rocky surfaces			0
they grow larger in diameter , rather than height , which is common in many other coral species			2
this gives them the advantage over other corals in terms of size , yet they are brittle and can break in storm conditions nervous system was set up in 2007 by creative director @entity48 and fellow @entity50 graduate @entity49 , who is chief science officer			2
it specialises in creating jewellery , homeware , lighting and puzzles inspired by patterns found in nature			1
among her @entity21 photos , @entity10 captured images of the @entity60 , also known as the @entity61			1
it is shaped like a vase , with grooves and pits on the outside , and grows to approximately 18 inches tall			0
it is found in coral reefs in the @entity8 , @entity69 , and @entity70			1
it is one of the most colourful sponges found in corals around the world ranging from pink to purple to fluorescent light blue			2
during the dive , @entity48 also managed to take macro photos of maze coral , known as the @entity81			1
@entity81 comes from the @entity83 word platys , meaning flat , and gyros , which means wide circle			0
this describes the maze - like channels of its skeleton			0
large maze corals can grow up to 7 - inches wide			0
one of the most hardy corals photographed during @entity10 's trip was the zoanthid , pictured , a type of so - called colonial coral			1
colonies of coral consist of separate polyps that can live together and each contribute to the area ¿ s ecosystem			2
zoanthids are photosynthetic yet can live in very low light levels and may occasionally eat brine shrip , for @entity105 zoanthid produces @entity106 that can be deadly the majority of corals found in the @entity8 and @entity69 are known colloquially as reef builders			1
they secrete calcium carbonate which hardens to form a coral skeleton , like the one pictured among her @entity21 photos , @entity10 captured images of the @entity60 , also known as the @entity61 , pictured left			1
the sponge is shaped like a vase , with grooves and pits on the outside , and grows to approximately 18 inches tall			0
during another dive , @entity10 caught @entity124 sea stars , pictured right , floating through the water			1
these stars have been known to live for up to 35 years and are distinguishable by their branched arms and complex structures one of the most hardy corals photographed during @entity10 's trip was the zoanthid , a type of so - called colonial coral			1
colonies of coral consist of separate polyps that can live together and each contribute to the area ’s ecosystem			2
zoanthids are photosynthetic , yet can live in very low light levels and may occasionally eat brine shrip , for @entity105 zoanthid , for example , produces @entity106 , which can be deadly			0
there are in excess of 30 different variations of zoanthid and palythoa polyps			0
the individual golden zoanthids , also captured by @entity10 , are approximately 0.25 - inches wide			1
they are found in the @entity8 and the @entity69 , predominately in shallow waters			1
the golden zaonthid grows symbiotically on several species of sponge in small groups and rows on the surface of their host			0
they resemble small sea anemones and get their name from their orange and yellow colouring			0
during the dive @entity48 also managed to take macro photos of maze coral , also known as the @entity81 , pictured			1
@entity81 comes from the @entity83 word platys , meaning flat , and gyros , which means wide circle			0
this describes the maze - like channels of its skeleton			0
large maze corals can grow up to 7 - inches wide the individual golden zoanthids , also captured by @entity10 , pictured , are , on average , approximately 0.25 - inches wide			1
they are found in the @entity8 and the @entity69 , predominantly in shallow waters			2
the zaonthid grows symbiotically on several species of sponge in small groups and rows on the surface of their host			0
they resemble small sea anemones and get their name from their orange and yellow colouring @entity10 used macro lenses and strobe lights to capture the extremely close - up images , pictured , and is planning to use the images as inspiration in her design studio during another dive , @entity10 caught basket sea stars floating through the water			1
these stars have been known to live for up to 35 years and are distinguishable by their branched arms and complex structures			0
they are part of a group known as brittle stars closely related to starfish and found in deep waters			1
the average basket weighs almost a stone ( 11lb ) and does n't contain any blood			0
instead they use their water vascular system to convert gases into energy			0
elsewhere , @entity10 found star encrusting corals			2
encrusting corals grow on hard rocky surfaces			0
they grow larger in diameter , rather than height , which is most common in many other coral species			0
this gives them the advantage over other corals in terms of size , yet they are brittle and can break in storm conditions			0
@entity48 graduated from @entity50 in 2005 with degrees in @entity232			0
' we are attracted to complex and unconventional geometries			0
our inspirations are grounded in the natural forms and corresponding processes which construct the world around us , ’ @entity10 said			2
‘ from coral aggregations to interference patterns , a study of natural phenomena is an essential ingredient to our design process			2
‘ we created @entity27 to explore a design approach that relates process and form in a context of interactivity and openness			2
’ the company writes computer programs , based on patterns found in nature , and uses these programs to create art , jewellery , household items , lights and puzzles			1
these include earrings shaped like dendrites , similar to those found in neurons , lamps inspired by the veins of leaves , and an amoeba jigsaw .			2

the breathtakingly clear and detailed images of *marine* life were captured during a trip to the @entity8
photographer @entity10 took the shots during dives off the coasts of @entity17 beach , @entity18 and @entity277
photos include coral skeletons , brittle stars , *poisonous* polyps and *brightly* - coloured sponges
@entity10 ’ firm @entity27 specialises in creating jewellery and lighting inspired by patterns found in nature
she used macro lenses and strobe lights to capture the bright , extremely close - up images
