@entity0 lined up in the 100 metres final at the @entity1 , shook his shoulders and threw the crowd his trademark beaming smile , in the middle of a row of bulging biceps and straining sinews			1
the camera panned to his right where the towering @entity13 @entity12 , standing a head taller than @entity15 at 6ft 4in , clapped his hands and pointed to the name on his stomach			1
next along was @entity19 , another @entity13 with a chest like a @entity22 god			2
in a field of raw muscle — poised to create an explosion of power — the @entity28 sprinter looked , well , small at 5ft 11in			1
‘ it was an in - house joke with my training group and then others started making comments			2
we started training in hot countries and everyone takes their tops off , or on the physio beds , you start to notice who has abs and who has n’t			2
some of the @entity58 guys who sprint — @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 — they ’re ripped and i ’m not , really			0
’ during the photoshoot preceding this interview , @entity15 messes around by pulling the skin tight around his stomach			1
and in an @entity70 account video that @entity15 posted to show him taking part in the @entity73 to raise money for the @entity75 , he drew on abdominal muscles with a marker pen before pouring the freezing water over himself			1
does it bother him that his fellow sprinters are often much bigger ? ‘ they are beasts , ’ he admits			0
‘ for some people their size can matter a lot			0
i could very well get on the start line , look at the other guys and think , “ @entity89			0
they ’re much bigger and more powerful than me ”			0
but i ’m able to move my body the speed that i move it being this size and i think as i get older i ’ll get bigger and stronger — maybe not as big as these guys are naturally , but i ’ll be able to run quicker			0
‘ physically , i ’m not a stereotypical sprinter			1
i ’m not big with biceps bulging everywhere			0
’ @entity12 of @entity13 ( middle ) wins 100m gold ahead of @entity0 at the @entity1 @entity0 stands alongside @entity99 on the medal podium for the 4x100m relay at @entity102 what @entity15 does possess , however , is a glorious technique , one which he is still honing in the pursuit of sprint glory			1
he burst on to the sprinting scene just before @entity108 by winning the @entity109 , but it is the 200m where he is now progressing at a faster rate			0
@entity0 became only the second @entity28 sprinter to run under 20 seconds when he recorded 19.98 in the 2013 @entity114 semi-finals and he now has in his sights @entity116 ’s 19.87 , the @entity28 record set 20 years ago			1
sprint legend @entity118 , the former 200m world record holder , described @entity0 ’s technique as ‘ phenomenal ’ and ‘ almost perfect ’ when he was just 18			1
three years on and the @entity120 at times mirrors @entity118 ’s upright style , straight back and legs pumping rapidly			1
‘ as a sprinter there are a couple of different types of ways to run , ’ @entity0 explains			1
‘ my natural endurance comes from football			0
i ’m not the biggest of guys and i have n’t got the biggest stride length , but my turnover is good so i can keep my legs moving and that ’s how i run			1
‘ that ’s how @entity118 ran			1
he was very relaxed and kept his legs turning over			0
he ’s got a unique style			1
i try to get myself tall , it ’s what you ’re meant to do			2
if people are comparing me to @entity118 that ’s not a bad comparison to have			1
i do n’t mind that at all			0
’ @entity0 celebrates winning 200m gold at the @entity148 @entity28 's @entity0 crosses the finish line ahead of @entity151 's @entity150 in the 4x100m relay @entity15 still has a long way to go before surpassing the @entity155 ’s previous world record of 19.32 and even further to get within touching distance of current champion @entity99 ’s 19.19			1
yet spectators often forget he is still only 21 and sprinters do not usually reach their peak until at least their mid- 20s			0
the two @entity35 golds in @entity161 — in the 200m , where he matched his personal best , and 4x100m relay — and @entity1 silvers in the 100m and 4x100m relay in @entity166 , are stepping stones on that path			0
@entity0 adds : ‘ when i ran 19.98 at the @entity171 it was cold , 10 o’clock at night , into a minus 1.6 wind			1
all in all , if you flip that wind around and make it a nice sunny day , i can see that time being a tenth of a second or more quicker			0
’ that is still , in sprinting terms , light years away from @entity99 ’s world record but , although @entity15 may lack the abs , he certainly does not lack the confidence to be a world - class sprinter			1
‘ if you never think you can reach those levels , you should n’t be a sprinter , ’ he says			2
‘ if you come to the sport thinking you ’ll never run near to those times , why are you bothering ? you ’ve got to have that belief			0
there wo n’t be anyone like him for a long time , but he ’s set the bar and it ’s up to us to try to touch it			2
that ’s what i ’m doing , trying to stick to him as closely as i can , then maybe one day beat him			2
‘ he has been beaten			0
@entity199 has beaten him , @entity198 has beaten him , @entity197 has beaten him			0
’ but @entity0 , who is funded partly by the @entity201 , will do it his way			1
in the sprint cauldron of muscle , tension , flexing , swaggering and testosterone , he is merely concentrating on himself			0
‘ in the off - season i ’ve got to be more careful because if i even so much as look at a cake i put on a pound of fat , ’ he says bursting into laughter			0
it is nice to know that some athletes suffer the same woes as the rest of us			2
as well as funding the @entity223 athletes , every week , @entity201 players raise over £ 33 million for arts , heritage , charity , community projects and grass roots sports clubs and facilities			2
