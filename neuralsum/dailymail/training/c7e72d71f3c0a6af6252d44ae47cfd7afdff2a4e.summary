a company has developed tracking devices for towels that alert managers to the whereabouts of their linen at all times			1
the concept was initially designed to help keep an eye on linen as it left hotels to be cleaned , but it is now proving a powerful preventative measure for robe raiders			1
the new technology may be bad news for opportunistic thieves , but it 's good news for hoteliers who lose up to 20 per cent of their linen every month			1
@entity22 has designed a chip that alert hotel managers to the whereabouts of their linen most losses are though wear and tear , but two per cent are through theft , estimates @entity29 , executive vice president of @entity22 , the company behind the tracking chip			1
if you 've stolen a towel or robe from a hotel room , you are far from alone			2
a poll by myvouchercodes.co.uk found that 68 per cent of @entity37 can not resist taking a towel or item of linen when they check out of a hotel			0
that number is set to plummet , as 2,000 hotels now use the tracking technology although @entity29 wo n't name which			1
he told @entity45 : ' our properties like to remain anonymous			0
they benefit from the gained efficiency and do n’t want to alarm guests that they have this technology			0
' he revealed while there are no @entity37 hotels currently using the chips they plan to enter the @entity37 market as soon as they find a partner and gain a license			2
2,000 hotels use radio frequency tracking in linen although company chief @entity29 wo n't name which @entity63 , a @entity64 - based company , has patented the chip which , once inserted allows managers to real - time track each and every towel using @entity69 ( @entity71 ) technology			1
a poll found 68 % of @entity73 steal linen from hotels the tiny chip send signals to antennae positioned at the hotel 's entrance or exit , letting owners know if a towel has left the property			1
towels are bendable , chips last up to 300 washes and tags can be read by sensors up to six feet away			2
as well as catching guests out , they are helpful for housekeeping if they want to find out when a towel has been removed from the wardrobe , so it can be restocked			0
@entity29 says , ' our solution not only provides total inventory information , but provides additional data like dwell time , wash count and laundry reconciliation which assists properties become more efficient			0
' he estimates that , although each property is different , most save about $ 50,000 ( £ 33,300 ) a year in lost linen			2
although @entity63 does not tell hoteliers the exact coordinates of a missing towel or robe , several thieves have successfully been asked to return pilfered hotel property			1
' it 's been phenomenal , ' @entity29 also told @entity113			0
' the chips create a lot of conversation			0
when my friends travel , they 'll call and ask , ' are you guys at my hotel ? '			0
