when president @entity1 visited the ' @entity2 ' on a @entity4 island on thursday , he believed he was looking at where @entity5 were shipped across the @entity7 into slavery			1
but not all may be as it first seemed			0
historians claim that the entrance of @entity12 on @entity13 where @entity1 posed for a photo opportunity was most likely only used for disposing of garbage			1
the role of the island in the slave trade has long been disputed , though it has become an important symbol and emotional reminder of the horrific events of the past			1
the @entity16 reports that many scholars now believe that people were kept at this fort , they might have been used by residents of the island rather than for mass transportation to the @entity55			0
many think that other locations in @entity58 , like @entity59 , have stronger claims to being huge staging posts for the slave trade			2
in the 1990s , @entity62 , an emeritus professor of history at @entity64 and the author of two dozen books on the @entity7 slave trade , became one of the first scholars to question the authenticity of the @entity12			1
touring : president @entity1 was accompanied to @entity13 by his wife @entity71 , their eldest daughter @entity71 , @entity71 's mother @entity73 and their niece @entity74 in a discussion on an online forum for historians , he said he believed the ' hoax ' was perpetrated by the charismatic @entity80			1
@entity80 was the museum 's first curator , and he ushered generations of visitors through the house , recounting the alleged horrors perpetrated there with theatrical pomp			0
@entity80 initially claimed that 20 million had passed through the house , upping it to 40 million by the time @entity62 visited in 1992 , four times the total figure of slaves exported from @entity58 overall			0
' a lot of people have been taken in by the @entity13 scam , ' @entity62 wrote			2
' though @entity13 is a picturesque place , it was marginal to the slave trade			1
' from 1501 to 1866 , an estimated 12 million slaves from @entity58 were sent to @entity36 , according to a database created by scholars using shipping records and plantation registers			0
of these , only 33,000 came from @entity13 , an insignificant portion of the overall total , the database shows			2
yet the plaques which grace the stone walls of the @entity12 speak of the ' millions ' of slaves that passed through its halls			0
@entity1 peered out at the crashing waves through the island 's ' @entity2 , ' at first by himself big step : mrs @entity115 joined him at the poignant doorway , and he said that the visit helped remind them of the importance of protecting civil rights meaningful : though the @entity2 has become a popular tourist destination , it was one of the more minor slave shipping ports in @entity4 the debate over the house 's place in history has become emotionally charged and politically treacherous in @entity4 , due to the high - profile role the museum plays in attracting tourists to the island , including celebrity visitors like @entity1 , @entity134 , pope @entity135 and former @entity138 presidents @entity136 and @entity139			1
on thursday @entity1 described the visit as a ' very powerful moment			0
' and that going to the site with his family helped them fully appreciate the magnitude of the slave trade			1
@entity1 also said that , as an @entity148 and an @entity148 - @entity148 president , the trip gaves him even greater motivation to stand up for human rights around the world , and the visit came just hours after he clashed with his @entity4 hosts over gay rights			2
he said the island is a reminder of what happens when civil rights are not protected			0
fatal doorway : when slaves try to escape by jumping from the walkway set up between the doorway and the awaiting ships , they would be eaten alive by sharks who swam around the island expecting the bodies of unhealthy slaves close hold : mrs @entity115 gives @entity71 a hug during a tour of the island alongside her mother @entity176 , who lives with the family in the @entity179			0

president @entity1 and his family visited @entity13 outside of @entity33
historians doubt the role of the island in the slave trade
@entity18 professor said : there are literally no historians who believe the @entity12 is what they 're claiming it to be '
@entity134 , pope @entity135 and former @entity138 presidents @entity136 and @entity139 have also visited the island
