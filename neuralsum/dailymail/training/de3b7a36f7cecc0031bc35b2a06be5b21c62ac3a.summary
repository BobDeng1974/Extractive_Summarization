there are clips on @entity2 of @entity3 slaloming his way past defences in the shirts of @entity7 and @entity8 before he rifles the ball into the top corner			1
@entity3 was widely regarded as one of the finest talents in world football when he joined @entity14 for a club record fee of £ 26million last summer			1
since then , he has barely had a kick			0
last month , when @entity14 manager @entity17 was asked about the @entity19 ’s contribution this season , he claimed : ‘ the jury is still out , if i ’m honest			1
’ they were hardly words of reassurance			0
his body compensated in other areas , eventually leading to the diagnosis of a fractured vertebra that has kept him out of a @entity14 shirt since a 15 - minute substitute appearance in the 3 - 0 victory over @entity38 on december 29			1
since his move — when he was signed with seven other players in a summer spending spree — he has made 10 starts , three in the @entity30			1
he has scored just once , in a @entity44 tie against @entity45			0
he impressed @entity14 fans in that tie but his confidence was not helped when he was left out of the next game — a 1 - 0 home defeat by @entity50 — by @entity51			1
there have been other signs of his talent , including a clever last - minute assist for @entity57 ’s winner at @entity58			0
but inside he is hurting and is absolutely determined to make amends next season			0
a queue of clubs playing @entity64 football next season would take @entity3 off @entity14 ’s hands , but he is n’t leaving			1
lack of action : @entity3 has made just 10 starts for @entity14 and has scored just once he has five years left on his contract and intends to live up to his billing as one of the world ’s best young players when the @entity30 resumes on august 16			1
@entity3 was happy to start a new life in @entity74 when he joined last summer , part of a progression that he mapped out in an interview with @entity78 when he was 12			2
he spoke of his ambition to leave @entity80 to play in @entity81 , @entity82 and ‘ preferably @entity83 because they speak the same language ’			2
his failure to grasp the language is another issue , something @entity17 referenced when @entity3 returned to @entity89 to see specialists because his @entity81 is better than his @entity82			2
lack of backing : @entity14 manager @entity17 has hardly provided reassurance for @entity3 in the early phase of his @entity14 career , as he adapted to his new life and the @entity96 home he shares with his girlfriend , he was still coming to terms with the language			1
@entity3 knows that after a year in @entity82 , a country he always had ambitions to play in when he was growing up with dad @entity104 and mum @entity105 , that he should have a better handle on it			1
off the field he is shy and introverted , spending time with his girlfriend and learning to love their quiet @entity74 life			0
his lack of playing time has come at a cost , with him missing out on a place in @entity116 ’s @entity80 squad for the @entity117			1
staying in : @entity3 's lack of action has seen him miss out on a place in the @entity80 @entity117 squad but @entity3 has been motivated by @entity17 and the manager ’s implied criticism before @entity14 ’s @entity30 clash with @entity125 on april 19			1
asked if he was coming under pressure from @entity14 ’s hierarchy to play @entity3 ( he was injured anyway ) , this was @entity17 ’s spiky response : ‘ the chance would be a fine thing			1
he ’s never been fit			0
he ’s an unknown quantity as far as i ’m concerned			0
’ at the start of the season @entity3 wanted to impress @entity51 , to continue the rich vein of goalscoring form that convinced chairman @entity136 he was capable of replacing @entity137			2
in his final season at the @entity140 , former @entity8 coach @entity138 made a subtle tactical tweak to his game and asked him to switch wings			0
he would cut in from the right on to his favoured left boot and ping balls into the penalty area for @entity148 , @entity149 or @entity150			0
former gaffer : @entity3 signed for @entity14 when @entity51 was still in charge it worked and he scored 15 times in 33 @entity156 appearances as @entity8 finished the season in sixth place			1
there ’s an assumption that @entity3 was recommended to @entity14 by their director of football @entity161 when he quit @entity8 to take up a similar position at @entity14 last summer			1
in fact they made their first approach in january 2013 , when @entity51 enquired about him in the transfer window			0
after such a long courtship , he is under pressure to create a stir at @entity14			2
he needs to do it soon			0
@entity3 - £ 30m @entity8 to @entity14 arrived as one of the brightest young talents in @entity174 but is now a forgotten man			1
@entity177 - £ 8.5m @entity176 to @entity58 the striker played 11 times , scored no goals and was sold at a huge loss			2
@entity183 - £ 7.5m @entity182 to @entity184 one of seven @entity186 signings last summer but the striker has scored only once			2
@entity188 - £ 27.5m @entity187 to @entity189 a panic buy , the @entity192 midfielder has never settled into life at @entity194			0
big move : @entity188 followed @entity196 ( right ) from @entity187 to @entity189 but it has not worked out @entity197 - £ 8.6m @entity198 to @entity199 scored on the opening day but has had just nine shots on target all season			0
@entity204 - £ 15m @entity8 to @entity205 scored only three goals , punched a team - mate and was loaned to @entity208 in january			0
@entity210 - £ 26m @entity209 to @entity14 arrived with a big reputation but has scored only 11 goals at a cost of £ 2.3m each			1
season of woe : @entity210 arrived at @entity216 from @entity209 at a cost of £ 26m @entity218 - £ 12.4m @entity219 to @entity125 just three appearances since his big - money move in january			2
@entity223 - £ 18m @entity224 to @entity184 in 19 games here , the defender has kept only one clean sheet			0
@entity230 - £ 6m @entity229 to @entity231 only scored two all season and outshone by @entity233			0
down and out : @entity234 striker @entity230 has failed to have much impact at @entity231			0

the 22 - year - old has not appeared for @entity14 since december 29
@entity3 has made just 10 starts and has scored one goal
the @entity19 has five years left on his contract and is determined to succeed at @entity216
his lack of action has seen him miss out on a place in @entity80 's squad for the @entity248 in @entity249
