by @entity0 feedback : departing hospital patients will be asked to rate their experience and whether they would recommend their ward hospital patients are to be asked whether they would recommend their ward to friends and family , under new government guidance issued yesterday			1
from april next year , every patient in @entity9 attending @entity10 or admitted to a ward will be able to give the customer service - style feedback			1
called the @entity14 , the aim of the initiative is to help hospitals to identify poor performance and encourage staff to make improvements where services do not live up to patients ' expectations			0
upon leaving hospital , patients will be asked : ‘ how likely are you to recommend our ward / @entity10 department to friends and family if they needed similar care or treatment ? ’ ’ they will be given the choice of six options from ‘ extremely likely ’ to ‘ extremely unlikely ’			1
follow - up questions will be asked where appropriate			0
the answers will be made public so that everyone has a clear idea of which wards , @entity10 departments and hospitals are providing the best care			0
the @entity44 : how likely are you to recommend our ward to friends and family if they needed similar care or treatment ? @entity10 : how likely are you to recommend our @entity10 to friends and family if they needed similar care or treatment ? possible responses : extremely likely likely neither likely nor unlikely unlikely extremely unlikely do n't know patients will be able to register their feedback online , via text messages , a smart phone app , telephone survey , postcard or ‘ voting booth ’ in the hospital			1
it is hoped that at least 15 per cent of patients from each @entity63 will respond			1
day cases , maternity patients , outpatients , and those under 16 will not be asked to take part			2
@entity69 , the health secretary , said : ‘ we want the @entity63 to treat patients as individuals , focus on making services more responsive to their needs and ensure they have as positive an experience of care as possible			1
‘ patients need to be listened to and their feedback acted upon			2
they also need to know that their hospital of choice is driving improvements to provide the very best care			0
' @entity82 in the wards and @entity10 departments of every hospital will make this a reality across the @entity63			2
’ the questionnaire was trialled in hospitals across the @entity90 this summer and was generally well received			0
but the guidance has received a mixed response from @entity93 , who works on patient experience at the @entity96 think - tank			0
@entity97 : patients can provide feedback via text message , smartphone app , email , post or phone she told @entity106 : ‘ it 's a very good thing to ask for patient feedback frequently			1
but there are some problems with it			0
the guidance says that it will empower patients to see themselves as customers and demand customer service			0
' i think the language of " ' customer " is antithetical to how patients feel about themselves when they are a patient ... i do n't think it will empower patients in any way because they do n't choose which @entity10 they go to and they do n't choose their wards			2

from april , every @entity63 patient in @entity9 will be asked to give feedback on their stay
government hopes the move will improve *standards*
patients will be able to vote online , by text or by post
