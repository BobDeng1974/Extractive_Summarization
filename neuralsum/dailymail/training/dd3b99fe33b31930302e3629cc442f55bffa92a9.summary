by @entity0 , @entity1 editor published : 16:07 est , 12 september 2013 updated : 17:52 est , 12 september 2013 among the new generation of brewers is a higher number of women , known as ' brewster 's beer lovers are enjoying a remarkable increase in choice with the establishment of hundreds of microbreweries , many of which are being opened my women			1
almost 200 have opened in the past year , says the @entity15 ( @entity15 ) – and many of the latest generation of ale brewers and drinkers are young and , in many cases , female			1
@entity22 , of brewer @entity23 , said : ‘ these days brewers are far more expeimental and this has led to lighter beers with new aromas and tastes which are attracting more women			0
’ the number of women drinking real ale accounts for over a fifth of @entity15 ’s membership , which is an increase of 20,000 over the past decade			1
rather than the mass produced froth of the big brand lagers , which are drunk cold and taste much the same , these beers are carefully crafted and each has a unique taste			0
historically , the idea of brewing beer on a small scale was the domain of grey - haired men in cardigans , however the new generation is both young and , increasingly , female			1
the rise of the small craft breweries appears contradictory when set against the fact the nation as a whole is drinking less beer , particularly in pubs			1
however , its success is being driven by the fact that each one offers a different taste to consumers , who enjoy the idea of ‘ real ’ food and drink from suppliers they know			0
key to the brewery revival was a change in the tax laws in 2002 with the establishment the @entity70 scheme			1
under the 2002 @entity70 scheme , brewers producing no more than 110,000 gallons per year only pay half the normal excise duty – 22p a pint rather than 44p			2
the editor of @entity15 ’s @entity76 2014 , @entity75 , said : ‘ there has been a boom in the growth of breweries over the last 12 months , resulting in a total of 1,147 breweries now producing beer in the @entity84 - and with more breweries comes greater choice for the drinker and more opportunities to buy locally produced brews			1
’ in the last ten years 20,000 more women have started brewing ale in the @entity84 , with many opening their own microbreweries it is only in modern times that men have overtaken women as the main brewers of beer , as historically it was women who dominated brewing			1
‘ traditionally known as ‘ brewsters ’ , it is fantastic to see more women rejoining the industry and in many cases giving the chaps a run for their money			0
one female owned and run brewery making a name for themselves nationally is the award winning @entity114 ’s brewery			0
founded by @entity15 members @entity114 and @entity117 at a small six barrel plant in @entity119 , @entity120 , in 2008 , they moved to a larger 15 barrel site in 2012 to help meet the growing demand			0
@entity114 said : ‘ brewing real ale is a great job , you get to experiment with new hops , rebrew old favourites and hopefully give the people who drink your beer a great pint			2
’ the number of breweries in @entity133 has doubled in the past year following the opening of 23 new establishments			2
on top of this one previously lost and much loved producer , the @entity138 , in @entity139 , is re-opening this week after more than 20 years			0
another area which has seen above average growth in breweries is @entity120 , with eight new starters taking the county ’s total to 57 - the highest of any region in the @entity84			2
breweries have been opened in a former dairy farm in @entity149 , @entity150 , and a converted school building in @entity152 , @entity153 .			0

number of female brewers , or ' brewsters ' has increased by 20,000 in ten years
rise is the result of new tax laws which makes brewing *cheaper* for some
though people are drinking less beer in the pub , almost 200 breweries opened in the @entity84 last year
