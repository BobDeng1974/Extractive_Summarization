by @entity0 employment minister : @entity2 praised bosses yesterday the longest pay squeeze in history is finally coming to an end as the jobs market continues to swell			1
last year 1,000 people a day stopped claiming @entity9 , with the number of claimants falling at its fastest rate for 16 years			1
the chancellor yesterday hailed the ‘ staggering ’ fall of 24 per cent , or 363,200 , in 12 months			1
he also bragged that for the first time in 35 years , our employment rate is higher than @entity19 ’s			1
the number of workers in @entity22 has reached 30.2million – the most since records began in 1971			1
nearly half – 14million – are women , including many bread - winning wives as well as those in families who can not survive on one income			1
employment minister @entity2 hailed business - owners – and those brave enough to set up a company during the financial crisis – for helping the jobs market to reach such heights			1
‘ the rise in employment is being fuelled by businesses and entrepreneurs across the country who are feeling increasingly confident with the improving economy , ’ she said			1
‘ they should be congratulated			0
’ in further good news , pay rises in the private sector are set to beat inflation for the first time following the onset of the financial crisis			1
since 2008 , the typical worker ’s wage increases have failed to match the rising cost of living , leaving many struggling as energy and food bills spiralled			1
but the @entity55 said yesterday that the average private sector worker is now seeing their pay rise by 1.7 per cent – just 0.2 percentage points below the current rate of inflation			1
the squeeze will continue to ease , @entity60 said yesterday , with pay rises set to beat inflation for each of the next five years			2
last year 1,000 people a day stopped claiming @entity65 , with the number of claimants falling at its fastest rate for 16 years the @entity70 predicts that next year wages will rise by 3.2 per cent , compared with inflation of just 2 per cent			1
@entity76 , senior economic adviser to the accountants @entity77 ’s @entity78 , said : ‘ with inflation expected to fall further this year , wage growth will soon outpace price rises and pay packets will go further than before			2
’ yesterday ’s @entity55 figures also debunked @entity82 ’s claims that the private sector could not create enough jobs for those made redundant by the state			2
the private workforce has risen by around 1.4million people since the last general election , while the number of public sector staff has dropped by 360,000			2
although these figures exclude the impact of ‘ reclassifications ’ by the @entity55 , such as moving the newly privatised @entity96 ’s workforce from the public to the private sector , mr @entity76 said : ‘ all in all , it is looking like a broad - based and sustained labour market recovery			1
’ the number of overall job vacancies jumped to 588,000 in february , the largest number since 2008 , while unemployment fell by 63,000 between november and january to 2.3million			2
two years ago , nearly six unemployment people were chasing every job vacancy , but today the figure is closer to four			2
the @entity55 said the record level of employment includes a huge increase in those who are self - employed			1
their ranks have swelled by around 500,000 since the @entity113 came to power , reaching a record 4.5million			0
experts say this may not be wholely due to entrepreneurial zeal , however			0
they suggest it could simply be that redundant workers have struggled to find well - paid work during the financial crisis , and decided to set up on their own instead			1
@entity60 has warned the job is far from done @entity60 yesterday welcomed the biggest upgrade to @entity126 growth forecasts for three decades but warned : ‘ the job is far from done			0
’ the independent @entity70 now expects the economy to grow by 2.7 per cent this year			0
this would represent the biggest leap for seven years			2
the watchdog also said the economy will surpass its pre-recession peak this summer			0
however , @entity22 is still on course to rack up a deficit of more than £ 100billion this year , with no surplus expected until 2019			1
the national debt is on course to top £ 1.5trillion , or £ 60,000 per household , in the coming years and will not start shrinking as a percentage of national income until 2016 - 17			1
‘ we set out our plan and together with the @entity22 people we held our nerve , ’ the chancellor said			1
‘ but the job is far from done			0
’ the @entity70 forecast growth of 2.7 per cent this year , compared with 2.4 per cent in the @entity149 in december and 1.8 per cent in the @entity126 last year			0
‘ that is the biggest upward revision to growth between @entity126 for at least 30 years , ’ said mr @entity60			2
‘ later this year the @entity70 expects @entity22 to reach the point when our economy is finally larger than before it collapsed six years ago			1
' that ’s because we ’re now growing faster than @entity157 , faster than @entity158 , faster than the @entity19			1
there is no major advanced economy in the world growing faster than @entity22 today			1
’ government borrowing fell to around £ 115billion last year and is expected to edge lower to £ 107.8billion this year – some £ 3.4billion less than predicted in december			2
the @entity70 now expects borrowing of £ 95.5billion in 2014 - 15 , shrinking further every eyar before @entity22 finally reaches a surplus of £ 4.8billion in 2018 - 19			1
mr @entity60 had hoped to balance the books by the general election next may , but sluggish economic growth in recent years means austerity will stretch well into the next parliament			2
@entity170 , chief economist at @entity171 , said : ‘ the original strategy was to combine recovery with repair of the public finances over the current @entity176			0
' the good news is that we are finally getting the recovery ; the bad news is that we are only halfway through what has now become a decade - long deficit reduction programme			2
’ @entity183 said the country faces more austerity because mr @entity60 ’s plans have failed			2
‘ back in 2010 you told us that by the end of 2014 , the economy would have grown by nearly 12 per cent , ’ he said			0
‘ today the figures say it ’s been barely half that , and you want the country to be grateful			1
’ unpopular : king john of england @entity60 had mps on both sides of the @entity198 laughing yesterday with a jibe likening @entity183 to @entity200 ’s notorious medieval ruler @entity195			2
announcing a grant to help pay for celebrations of the 800th anniversary of the signing of the @entity206 by the 13th century king , the chancellor made a series of unflattering comparisons between the ‘ weak ’ @entity195 and the @entity82 leader			0
to cheers from the @entity213 benches – and laughter from shadow chancellor @entity215 – mr @entity60 told @entity196 : ‘ @entity195 ’s humbling centuries ago seems unimaginably distant			1
‘ a weak leader , who had risen to the top after betraying his brother , compelled by a gang of unruly barons to sign on the dotted line			0
' so i will provide a grant to the @entity225 to ensure that today ’s generation learn the lessons of the past			0
’ it was a thinly - veiled reference to the way mr @entity183 vanquished his older brother @entity231 with the help of trade union barons as they fought for the @entity235 in 2010			0
the parallels are not exact			0
@entity195 , the youngest son of @entity237 , did attempt to seize control from his older brother @entity240 , who had been kidnapped during the @entity241 and imprisoned in @entity157 in 1192			0
but the attempt was unsuccessful and @entity195 was banished when @entity240 returned to @entity200 in 1194			0
labour party leader @entity183 responds after @entity60 delivered his @entity126 statement to the @entity198 unlike the @entity244 , however , @entity240 and @entity195 were soon reconciled			0
@entity246 , by contrast , has quit as an mp and moved to the @entity19 to avoid becoming part of the ‘ soap opera ’ surrounding his brother			1
@entity195 ’s reconciliation with his brother allowed him to become king on @entity240 ’s death in 1199			0

he was considered a failure as a king , losing major lands to @entity263 and being forced into a humiliating climbdown by the nobility			0
