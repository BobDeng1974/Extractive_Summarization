@entity1 ’s chances of landing @entity2 have all but disappeared with the player now needed to replace the injured @entity4 until the end of the season , when he will leave @entity7 on a free transfer			1
the @entity9 failed to bring the @entity11 winner to the @entity12 in the summer but looked like getting a second opportunity in the summer with @entity7 still willing to let @entity2 leave for around £ 5million in january rather than lose him for free in the summer			1
but @entity4 is out for three months having torn a tendon in his thigh and @entity17 said on wednesday : ' we will solve the problem because we have @entity20 and @entity2 as a @entity11 - winning pairing and @entity22 can also play there			0
' @entity2 should be available on a free transfer in the summer , with @entity25 and @entity26 leading the way @entity2 ( right ) could still sign a new contract , but it is likely he will depart when his contract runs out at @entity7 @entity2 ’s form between now and the end of january in @entity4 ’s place could yet force @entity7 to improve the rejected offer they made the player last season			1
but it seems more likely the player will sign a pre-contract agreement in january with @entity25 favourites over @entity26 for his signature			0
@entity43 is a massive fan and has already signed @entity2 once when he was at @entity7			0
@entity25 are slight favourites because they favour players returning to @entity45			0
@entity2 is now needed by @entity7 because of the injury to midfielder @entity4 if the @entity49 champions do capture the 27 - year - old , who captained @entity45 in their 1 - 0 win over @entity53 in @entity54 on tuesday , it will be a victory for chairman @entity55 over coach @entity56			2
the former @entity58 manager is not @entity2 ’s biggest fan and is still unhappy that the club allowed @entity20 to leave for @entity7 at the start of the season			0
@entity55 , however , sees signing @entity2 on a free having sold @entity20 to @entity7 for £ 30m after the @entity11 as good business			1
manager @entity56 is not @entity2 ’s biggest fan , but @entity55 wants the @entity64 after an indifferent start to the campaign , @entity65 will want to strengthen certain areas of his squad			2

@entity2 should be available on a free transfer in the summer
@entity25 lead the hunt for his signature , but @entity26 are also *lurking*
@entity1 *'s* hopes of signing him in january for £ 5million have been *dashed*
@entity7 now need the midfielder because of an injury to @entity4
@entity56 is not *thought* to be keen on the @entity64 @entity11 winner
but @entity25 chief @entity55 thinks it is good business
