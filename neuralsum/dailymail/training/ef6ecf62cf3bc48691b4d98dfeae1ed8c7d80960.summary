as we slip into the colder months it ’s time to reach into the back of the wardrobe and pull out the warmest , cosiest clothes you can find			1
trouble is , you might get a lot more than you bargained for			0
october is the month for discovering moth infestations according to pest control experts			1
they ’ve lain undisturbed , happily chewing through your best cashmere and had ample time , space and fuel to breed like wild fire , strewing everything with larvae			0
what ’s more , there are more around than ever			1
if left untreated the larvae — it ’s the caterpillar - like larvae that eat fabrics , not adult moths — can do hundreds of pounds worth of damage to clothing , carpets and soft furnishings			1
it ’s @entity37 , and you need to be prepared			1
so , from conkers and smoke bombs to microwaves and pheromone strips — here ’s what you need to know to beat them			1
@entity24 , managing director of @entity26 pest controllers , has seen at least 10 per cent more call - outs in the last year and 30 per cent more over the past five years why @entity48 ? thanks to the influx of cheap cashmere on the @entity53 we own far more natural fibres than we used to and , as high quality fabrics are a moth ’s favourite meal , they ’re thrilled			1
the increased use of walk - in wardrobes means the moths have far more space to access clothes and remain undetected			1
the unusually warm summer has also helped to increase the moth population , while our open windows have encouraged them indoors			1
@entity24 also blames a decrease in the strength of pesticides			1
thanks to the influx of cheap cashmere on the @entity53 we own far more natural fibres and high quality fabrics are a moth ’s favourite meal ‘ part of the problem has been the withdrawal of some of the most effective insecticides such as dichlorvos , which is now deemed dangerous to health			1
‘ there used to be almost 400 insecticides available to pest controllers , now there are more like 30			1
’ to add to this , we heat our homes all year round , fail to clean as rigorously as our grandparents and fly off on cheap package breaks to places such as @entity93 and @entity94 — bringing back carpets and fabrics infested with moth eggs			1
@entity98 ? @entity99 the best thing you can do to prevent a moth attack is to put your clothes away when they are clean			1
larvae gravitate towards grime as it ’s higher in protein - rich nutrients			1
@entity108 , a seamstress known as @entity109 , says : ‘ deter them by emptying your wardrobe and washing everything			0
if something ca n’t be washed , get it dry - cleaned			1
clean out the inside of your wardrobe , too			1
take everything out , vacuum and wipe the insides			0
’ moths lay most eggs in the carpet so destroy them at the source by moving furniture and vacuuming in all crevices			0
a moth ’s life cycle can be anything from 55 to 90 days so give your home and clothing a thorough clean every month or two — or they ’ll come crawling back a moth ’s life cycle can be anything from 55 to 90 days so give your home and clothing a thorough clean every month or two — or they ’ll come crawling back			1
make sure you empty the vacuum cleaner bag or they ’ll hatch there , too			0
@entity138 as bonkers as it sounds , this really works			0
for clothing that ca n’t be washed , such as leather or fur , put it in the freezer			1
‘ it does n’t damage clothing at all , ’ says @entity108			1
‘ you need to do it for at least 72 hours to kill all moths and eggs			0
i put my clothes in individual plastic bags first — you do n’t want moth eggs in your food — then take them out and hang them to air dry			1
’ microwave even more barmy - sounding — and not for the faint hearted — you could try exterminating moths from garments by putting them briefly in the microwave			1
a study for the @entity165 found that all moths , larvae and eggs could be killed when 10 per cent wool fabrics were microwaved for three minutes at @entity171 microwave radiation — the frequency of modern microwave ovens			1
you could try exterminating moths from garments by putting them briefly in the microwave			0
the side effects were a tiny amount of shrinkage but no colour change			0
‘ one of my clients swears by microwaving her cashmere tops to kill larvae but i would n’t dare , ’ says @entity108			0
@entity186 take precautions with your best sheets , outfits or precious fabrics by storing them in plastic vacuum packed sealed bags if you do n’t need them in the near future			1
@entity197 sells a set of two for £ 10			2
or you could go one better and wrap special items in acid - free tissue paper before vacuum packing			2
‘ acid - free paper helps prevent clothing getting hard creases which cause weak spots in fabric , ’ says @entity108			1
‘ it also protects them from plastic which contains chemicals which can damage fibres			0
’ for professional vacuum packaging try @entity213 ( ukweddingdresscleaners.co.uk ) and try @entity214 for acid - free paper ( £ 5.29 , staples.co.uk )			2
conkers and @entity217 ‘ plants produce harmful chemicals and unappealing smells to stop insects eating them and their seeds , ’ says moth expert dr @entity218 of the @entity219 in @entity220			2
‘ it ’s biochemical warfare			2
’ @entity228 have one of the strongest moth - repelling aromas			1
‘ as conkers dry out a gas is emitted which works as a mild insecticide , killing moths and larvae , ’ says @entity24			1
conkers must be fresh ; so put new ones in your drawers every few weeks			0
other less strong but decent repellents include eucalyptus and bay leaves , cinnamon sticks and cloves			2
@entity246 ‘ @entity246 , thanks to its strong smell , is a very good deterrent , ’ says @entity108 , a seamstress known as @entity109 the problem is , many of the above leave musky smells			1
‘ @entity246 , thanks to its strong smell , is a very good deterrent , ’ says @entity108			1
‘ ideally , put a bag of lavender on every hanger and a couple in every drawer			0
if that ’s too much hassle , sprinkling lavender into a tray at the bottom of your wardrobe works , too			2
’ buy a kilo of lavender for £ 10 from driedlavendershop.co.uk and refresh old lavender by adding a couple of drops of lavender oil			2
what to do if it ’s too late mothballs fade quickly and are often too weak to bring down numbers significantly enough to save your favourite jumper @entity278 these catch moths quickly without any pesticide and give useful clues as to how bad your infestation is			1
usually these look like a rectangular flat piece of sticky cardboard with tent - like sides			2
male moths fly inside then get stuck on the sticky surface			0
‘ they are really effective ; i ’ve seen 20 or more caught on one , ’ says dr @entity218			0
‘ the sticky bit of the trap is impregnated with a female pheromone that attracts male moths only			0
’ with no males left , females die without laying eggs and you win			0
( £ 5.56 , @entity300 at @entity301 )			0
smoke bombs sometimes , you need to bring out the big guns			0
mothballs fade quickly and are often too weak to bring down numbers significantly			0
use a smoke bomb instead			0
‘ get one for when you know you will be away for the weekend , as they can be quite potent , ’ says @entity108			0
@entity311 ( £ 5.79 from mothkiller.co.uk ) contains the toxic chemical permethrin which destroys all moths quickly			0
use it in one room after shutting the door and all windows			0
the smoke wo n’t damage furniture or fabrics but you ’ll need to air the room out afterwards			2
@entity324 unfortunately moths have great taste			0
‘ they love natural fabrics which give them more nutrition than synthetic materials because of their high keratin protein content , ’ says @entity24			1
‘ because they are made of very fine fibres , fabrics such as cashmere , angora and silk are also easier for moths to digest , ’ adds dr @entity218			2
but if the worst happens and you find your jumper holier than a cheese grater , all is not lost			0
if a moth has munched through a family heirloom , it might be worth sending it to an expert to be invisibly mended ‘ little holes are easy to fix , ’ says @entity108			2
‘ turn the garment inside out , do a few overstitches to catch the loose threads together then steam or iron it flat again and you ’ll barely notice a difference			0
’ for bigger holes use a patch , darn it or cover it with embellishments			0
@entity108 suggests using lace ( ‘ always pretty ’ ) , worn denim ( ‘ new denim has no give ’ ) and wide velvet ribbon ( ‘ much stronger than normal ribbon ’ ) for attractive patches — or vintage lace coasters from craft websites such as @entity363			2
‘ be imaginative or use bits from old clothes – just make sure the patch has been washed before attaching it so it does n’t shrink , making the garment pucker			0
’ invisible mending if a moth has munched through a family heirloom , it might be worth sending it to an expert to be invisibly mended			2
‘ it ’s expensive and takes ages but is utterly brilliant if it ’s something you care about and do n’t want to throw away , ’ says @entity108			2
the intricate sewing technique , which takes years to master , involves taking threads from the seam allowances inside the garment and using them to intricately re-weave the patch that ’s missing , by hand , to perfectly match the material ’s existing stitching			2
the @entity393 invisible mending service has a handful of invisible menders in @entity396 and @entity397			0
prices start at £ 40 for a small hole .			0
