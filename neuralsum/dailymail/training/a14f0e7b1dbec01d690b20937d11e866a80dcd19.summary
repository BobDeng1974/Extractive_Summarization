by @entity0 published : 15:40 est , 13 may 2013 updated : 16:55 est , 13 may 2013 facing life sentence : sgt. @entity2 , the @entity4 killed five fellow soldiers in @entity6 a @entity8 soldier , who pleaded guilty to shooting dead five fellow servicemen at a combat stress clinic in @entity6 , killed his comrades with premeditation , a military judge said on monday in a ruling that will almost surely get him life in prison			1
@entity4 sergeant @entity20 , in a deal that spared him the death penalty , pleaded guilty last month to killing two medical staff officers and three soldiers at @entity23 in @entity24 in a 2009 shooting that the military has said may have been triggered by combat stress			1
@entity20 , of @entity27 , @entity28 , faced an abbreviated court - martial at @entity30 in @entity31 to determine the level of his guilt and whether he acted with premeditation , as prosecutors said , or on impulse , as the defense has argued			2
the judge in the case , army colonel @entity38 , asked @entity20 , who appeared at a brief morning hearing in green military dress , to stand and gave his ruling			2
he did not provide further details			0
killed in the 2009 shooting in @entity24 were @entity46			0
@entity47 , of @entity48 , @entity46 , and four @entity4 service members : @entity50			0
@entity51 , of @entity52 , @entity53 ; dr. @entity54 , of @entity55 , @entity28 ; sgt. @entity56 , of @entity57 , @entity58 ; and spc. @entity59 , of @entity60 , @entity61 @entity20 's state of mind before , during and after the attack , one of the worst incidents of soldier - on - soldier violence in the @entity6 war , has been central to legal proceedings over the past year at the @entity70 military base			1
@entity20 's lawyers argued that he was deluded by depression and despair at the time			1
an @entity4 mental health board found that @entity20 suffered from severe depression with psychotic features and post-combat stress			1
@entity20 had long sought help with sleep troubles and was stammering and crying for help in the days before the shooting			2
killed in the attack : ( from left ) pfc			0
@entity84 , and maj @entity85 victims : ( from left to right ) spc. @entity59 , 20 , of @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity88 , died may 11 , 2009 at @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity6 his commanders were so alarmed that they disarmed him and sent him for repeated visits to mental health clinics , said attorney @entity92			0
but prosecutors argued that @entity20 was trying to paint himself as mentally ill in an attempt to win early retirement â€” just as he was facing a sexual harassment complaint that could derail his career and his benefits			0
the day before the killings , psychiatrist @entity100 told him that a mental disability retirement would require ' some kind of suicidal psychotic crisis , ' maj. @entity99 said during closing arguments , according to the @entity106			0
but when @entity20 saw @entity100 again the next day , the psychiatrist said he had no intention of giving him ' a golden ticket ' out of the @entity4			0
in his ruling , the judge ultimately sided with prosecutors who said @entity20 tried to gain a quick exit from the @entity4 and had then sought revenge on a mental health worker who would not help him achieve that goal			0
cout - martial : oldiers assisting with communications and security tasks stand outside the building at @entity30 , @entity31 , where the court - martial for @entity4 sgt. @entity20 was held the mandatory sentence for even one count of premeditated murder is life in prison , and at issue going forward is whether @entity20 will ever be eligible for parole			2
both sides will present arguments , and @entity38 is likely to rule on that by week 's end			0
prosecutors have argued that @entity20 had more than 40 minutes to consider his actions as he drove to the clinic in a stolen @entity136 and @entity138 rifle , and witnesses have testified to how he removed identification tags and the gun 's optic , and had a stone - faced demeanor as he stalked to the clinic			1
an @entity4 forensic science officer who analyzed the scene after the attack testified that @entity20 killed with the tactical precision of a trained soldier			1
defense attorneys said @entity20 's mental health , severely weakened by several combat tours , deteriorated further and that he was suicidal prior to the attack and provoked to violence by maltreatment at the hands of healthcare workers he sought for help at @entity23			1
a forensic psychiatrist , dr. @entity158 of the @entity159 , concluded that @entity20 suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder and psychosis at the time of the shootings and had death wishes related to his illnesses .			1
