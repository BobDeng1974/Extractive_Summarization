' i think we need to look at possibly where the comments have come from and who sponsors those organisations , ' she said			0
' it 's a very , very big issue here			2
' it 's also a censorship issue , you know ? this has been promoted and printed i know it 's well over 500,000 times because the ( inaudible ) manual has been printed that many times already			1
' and it 's in many , many other books across the world			0

i originally created this page out of love and kindness and to share my story so that any @entity219 in a similar position who has been told to put their child on a gluten free and dairy free diet would have a place to come to for inspiration and ideas			2
when you are told your child can not have these foods , sometimes its overwhelming and scary and you are unsure where to start			0
this is why i created @entity19			0
