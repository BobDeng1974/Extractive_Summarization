immigration is responsible for 84 per cent of the surge in @entity4 ’s population this century , a report claims today			1
it suggests the true impact of immigration has been ‘ substantially understated ’ because the @entity8 did not count 1.3million children born to foreign parents as migrants			1
the report concludes that of the 4.6million population rise between 2001 and 2012 , 3.8million is due to the biggest wave of immigration the country has faced			1
not including children born in the @entity4 meant net migration was recorded at a much lower 2.5million			1
sir @entity20 , chairman of @entity21 , pictured , said official figures underestimated the scale of immigration as they do not count the @entity4 - born children of recent migrants as immigrants @entity21 , the think - tank that carried out the study using official data , said it was ‘ undeniable ’ that migration had driven population growth , putting pressure on public services and depressing wages			1
it shows how @entity38 ’s decision at the turn of the century to make it easier for migrants to come to @entity4 has changed the face of the country			0
in its most recent publication , the @entity8 said that , on average , 57 per cent of the @entity4 ’s population increase since 2001 has been due to net migration			2
the statisticians , whose figures comply with international standards , attribute the remainder to the excess of births over deaths – the ‘ natural increase ’ – as people live longer			0
but research by @entity21 has revealed the figure does not include children born to immigrants arriving over the last decade			1
when counted , the figure rises to 84 per cent			0
the report criticised the @entity8 prediction that 60 per cent of future population growth until 2037 will be down to migration as a ‘ serious understatement ’			2
this suggested 43 per cent of the increase would be due to immigrants arriving after 2012 , and 17 per cent to any children they have			0
but this did not take into account the future children of migrants already here , which would make the figure ‘ much higher ’ , the think - tank said			1
moreover , the estimate was based on net migration of 165,000 a year , while it is currently at around 245,000			0
@entity21 pointed out that the birth rate is 1.83 children per woman , compared with the 2.1 needed to sustain the population			2
the @entity8 said 57 per cent of the @entity4 's population increase since 2001 is due to immigration official figures have shown that birth rates among migrants often increase when they arrive in the @entity4 , possibly as a result of better living conditions here			1
@entity21 said the birth rates meant that within 25 years any population increase would ‘ be entirely due to net migration ’			2
@entity8 figures to be released tomorrow will confirm that the government is missing its target to reduce net migration to the ‘ tens of thousands ’			0
sir @entity20 , chairman of @entity21 , said : ‘ this is about population growth , not about citizenship			2
‘ those born in the @entity4 to settled immigrant parents are @entity4 citizens , irrespective of their parents ’ country of birth			0
‘ that said , it is now undeniable that the massive scale of net migration has been the main cause of our population growth and that , in the future , our population growth is likely to be almost entirely due to migration			0
’ he added that official @entity8 statistics did not make this clear			0
an @entity8 spokesman said : ‘ in accordance with the @entity119 international standards , the @entity8 does not define children who are born in the @entity4 as immigrants			1
‘ @entity21 has used a different definition which produces a higher total			0

@entity21 said 1.3 million children have been born to immigrants
the think - tank *complains* that these children are not counted by the @entity8
a report claims the population has increased by 4.6 million since 2001
@entity21 said immigration placed services under pressure
they also claimed that large numbers of immigrants were lowering wages
