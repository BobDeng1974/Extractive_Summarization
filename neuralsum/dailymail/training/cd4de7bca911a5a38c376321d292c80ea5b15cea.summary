by @entity0 the manuscript of @entity3 ’s long - awaited autobiography has been delivered to publishers @entity5 ahead of an august launch			1
the @entity3 life story had been due for release in spring 2013 but was delayed for more than a year because the @entity10 midfielder was allegedly not satisfied with the chapters written by his first ghost writer , award - winning sports journalist @entity12			2
this is despite @entity3 tweeting to his 2.46million followers how much he enjoyed book meetings with his ‘ friend ’ @entity12 , a former @entity18 no 1 table tennis player and an expert on the psychology of sport			2
controversial : @entity3 's autobiography will be released in august shock : @entity3 is thought to have fallen out with award winning ghost writer @entity12 ( right ) it seemed an ideal partnership with @entity3 starting a philosophy degree at @entity28			1
but it ’s understood @entity3 felt there was too much of @entity12 ’s style in the first draft leading to another ghost writer working with the footballer , who tweeted on tuesday : ‘ ca n’t wait for my book			1
’ @entity3 has promised a tell - all tome , threatening when @entity12 started work on the project to expose @entity40 host @entity41 , whom he described as an ‘ odious little toad , with a vast closet of skeletons ’			2
@entity41 called it ‘ scurrilous nonsense ’ , adding : ‘ i had a good look in my closet and only found a few packets of crisps			0
’ @entity5 said only the book would not disappoint while @entity12 could n’t comment for ‘ contractual reasons			0
’ staying out of it : @entity41 has already slammed some of the accusations in the book @entity57 , official supermarket for @entity61 ’s @entity60 campaign in @entity62 , have not renewed that deal for @entity64 2014 , as well as exiting the @entity66 programme			0
the @entity66 need to find a backer for their kids ’ scheme at a time £ 1.6m @entity61 funding has been withdrawn for failing to meet participation levels			0
the @entity66 have put licensed goods in various supermarkets rather than one partner			0
@entity75 are prepared to wait until september to secure their next kit sponsorship deal			1
however , such a late agreement before @entity75 ’s new kit cycle starts in 2015 - 16 would mean all replica strips being flown in rather than shipped , reducing @entity75 ’s profit margins on those likely £ 90 shirts			1
a sign the @entity83 are preparing for @entity84 not renewing their £ 120m title sponsorship in two years is that preliminary talks have reportedly taken place with @entity88 , who backed the @entity91 rugby equivalent for five seasons			0
@entity94 ’s @entity93 revenge @entity97 boss @entity96 , still furious about @entity99 network @entity93 filming a private conversation in which he made disparaging remarks about @entity103 , is making sure he does n’t speak to the network while in @entity99 for wednesday 's @entity106 tie against @entity107			1
@entity96 is asking every @entity99 media representative whether they work for @entity110 before answering questions			2
@entity97 say @entity112 have sympathy with @entity94 ’s stance , so will not fine him for breaching media regulations			0
got time : @entity75 will wait to reveal their new kit sponsorship no way : @entity97 manager @entity96 will refuse to speak to @entity110 + while in @entity119 former @entity61 cricket chief @entity120 , now technical director of elite coaching , is not even the most senior member of that @entity125 department			1
his boss is @entity127 , head of elite coaching development , which begs the question why @entity120 was kept on the payroll after the @entity132 debacle with his presence sure to complicate life for his successor			1
meanwhile , the @entity125 say it is ‘ right and proper ’ for @entity127 , the former @entity139 batsman , to be in the interview group picking the new @entity61 head coach because he helped to pick @entity120			1
snub : @entity120 is not even the most senior member of the elite coaching department of the @entity125 football reporter @entity142 has become @entity144 ’ new chief executive			1
@entity142 will now be buying and selling rather than writing about deals such as @entity75 signing @entity146 last june — described by one website as the worst transfer story ever			0
@entity150 has opted out of @entity112 and @entity152 politics but continues as global ambassador for @entity155 energy giant @entity154 , the @entity106 sponsors			0
@entity154 are ‘ unable to share details of the agreement ’ but informed sources say it is worth € 5m a year to the @entity159 legend			0
new line of work : @entity142 , who reported a ' @entity146 to @entity75 ' story , is @entity144 's new chief executive			2
