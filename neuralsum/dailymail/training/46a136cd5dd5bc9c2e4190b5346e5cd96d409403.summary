@entity1 ’s extraordinary start to the season , maintained with a brilliant opportunist ’s goal from @entity5 at the @entity6 , has been built on the best defensive record in the country			1
the @entity1 have kept six clean sheets in 10 @entity11 matches and conceded just five goals , two of them at @entity16 in the first match @entity14 ’s side played together			1
@entity18 is a key component of the division ’s best back line and the 23 - year - old right - back sees no reason why this dream season can not continue — for club and country			1
@entity18 has been in impressive form for high - flying @entity1 so far this season @entity5 's first - time effort from 40 yards out gave @entity1 an early lead at the @entity6 ‘ i think i ’ve got the ability to play for my country			1

with centre - halves @entity65 and @entity67 and defensive midfielders @entity5 ( left ) and @entity69 , @entity14 has constructed a sturdy platform on which his flair players have freedom to operate			2
‘ we work hard on our defensive shape in training and it shows during games , ’ @entity18 said			1
