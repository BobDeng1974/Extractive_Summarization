looking for female talent : @entity9 and @entity10 say they 'll shell out out as much as $ 20,000 for women to put their parenthood plans on ice @entity10 has already started covering the procedure , which can cost $ 10,000 or more plus annual storage fees , and @entity9 's program begins in january , according to @entity30			1
