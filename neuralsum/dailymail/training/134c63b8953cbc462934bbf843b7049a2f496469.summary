by @entity1 reporter published : 06:43 est , 6 july 2013 updated : 06:52 est , 6 july 2013 not a single office in @entity4 's @entity3 has been filled , a year after the building was inaugurated , it has been revealed			1
while tourists and diners have flocked to the 360 degree viewing platform and sky - high restaurants at what is @entity14 's tallest building , big businesses have been somewhat less enthused			1
it is thought just 10 per cent of the skyscraper 's 25 - floors of office space have been let , with any firms not expected to move in until next year			1
the @entity3 has been a hit with tourists and diners , who have flocked to its viewing platforms and restaurants , but its 25 floors of office space remain empty a year after the building 's inauguration unrivaled experience : tourists have flocked to the @entity3 to experience the viewing platform and the building 's three restaurants but it has struggled to attract businesses so far just 12 months ago @entity4 mayor @entity36 confidently predicted the @entity3 would ' act as a huge commercial magnet , creating vital new jobs and bringing in scores of businesses '			1
there have been rumours a number of high - profile firms are on the brink of moving in , including financial advisers @entity48 , @entity50 tv channel @entity49 and another @entity52 company , @entity51			1
but even if deals have been agreed , that would only mean about three of the floors being taken			2
information on rents and prospective tenants is a closely - guarded secret , but it is thought the amount of prospective tenants pale in comparison to other new buildings in @entity4 , such as the @entity65 and @entity66 towers , which are 50 per cent let before construction has even finished			2
but @entity68 , the developer behind the 72 - storey structure , remains confident businesses will soon be moving in			1
confident : @entity36 said the @entity3 would be a ' commercial magnet ' when he openedlast year , left			2
@entity68 , the building 's developer , says that remains the case and expects firms to move in next year imposing : the @entity3 is the dominant feature in @entity4 's skyline and is @entity14 's tallest skyscraper , with 72 floors he told @entity81 : ' we have signed up a few tenants and are in discussion with a number of others and we will make a decision when we are ready			1
we are taking our time , as we do n't just want to fill the @entity3 up with accountants or lawyers			0
' mr @entity68 added the business plan for the building allowed for the first leases to be signed as late as 2014 , and was in ' no hurry ' to get firms on board before then			2
the cost of running a skyscraper is astronomical , with cleaning windows costing about £ 150,000 a year alone powering the building involves ' pre-booking ' a block amount of electricity from the grid that has to be paid for even if it is not to be used			0
office tenants also pay a service charge for items like cleaning and security , which one consultant said could come to as much as £ 9 million a year when the @entity3 is fully let			0
more than half a million tickets have been sold for the building 's viewing platform the consultant , who did n't want to be named , told the paper mr @entity68 is taking a ' determined stance ' on who he would allow in the building and said it was ' bold ' he had n't held a launch specifically for the property market			1
but he backed him to succeed because demand for office space in @entity4 continues to grow			0
' the prospects for the @entity3 look better than when it completed last year , ' he said			0
mr @entity68 said more than half a million tickets had been sold for the viewing platforms and added : ' the @entity3 has been a long time coming			0
but this is a building that is going to last a few centuries			0
' the businessman is also developing the building next door , the place , which , together with its imposing neighbour , make up what is known as the @entity137 .			0

@entity14 's tallest skyscraper struggling to attract businesses
twenty - five floors of offices remain empty 12 months after launch
but developer confident ' *patient* ' approach will pay off and expects space to be filled by 2014
