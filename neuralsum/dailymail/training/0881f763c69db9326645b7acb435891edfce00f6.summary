here 's an anecdote that tells you a little of what you need to know about @entity3 , unquestionably one of the best coaches this country has produced and who passed away in his sleep on friday aged 82			1
a few years ago the @entity8 were keen to give him an outstanding services award			2
only trouble was the @entity8 dinner , where the award is given out , is the social highlight of @entity15 week , attended by over 300 people and @entity3 did n’t like giving speeches or being singled out for attention			1
eventually we persuaded him to attend and he duly looked petrified when it was his turn to stand up			2
he uttered about 30 words but it was so clearly spoken from the heart , he said more in that time than plenty of other speakers say in 20 minutes			2
he was given a standing ovation			2
tribute : @entity29 wears a black ribbon in memory of @entity32 , who died on friday memory : @entity34 wears a black ribbon in tribute to @entity32 , who died on friday on the practice ground , you could n’t shut him up , of course			1
his idea of heaven was nattering away for hours on end about the golf swing			2
quite honestly his @entity45 accent was so strong i struggled to understand what he was saying half the time but i still liked listening to him			0
in @entity51 yesterday , players who knew him , from @entity34 to @entity29 , paid their own small tribute by wearing black ribbons on their caps			1
@entity3 produced one fine @entity56 golfer and @entity58 captain in @entity59 , coached many other good tour pros including another @entity58 player and skipper in @entity63 , and one undeniably great golfer in @entity65			1
well done , son : @entity3 ( right ) celebrates with @entity59 after @entity56 win the @entity58 at the @entity67 in 2002 legend : @entity3 helped many players including major champion @entity65 when they teamed up in 1998 , @entity65 had a wonderful short game but it would be kind to describe his long game as average			1
over the next decade they worked so hard to transform his mediocre swing into one that delivered no fewer than three majors			0
‘ it would n’t have happened without @entity3 , absolutely not , ’ said @entity65			1
‘ he was like a father to me			0
’ @entity63 took time out from a holiday in @entity81 to pen a heartfelt missive			0
‘ i feel blessed to have known @entity3 and to have had him as my coach since 1992 , ’ he reflected			1
‘ not only was he a world - class coach , a fact recognised across the game , he was also one of my favourite people in life			0
’ but it was @entity65 who summed up how the golfing world should remember him			0
‘ his passing is not to be mourned , ’ said the @entity93			0
‘ he did this game a great service			0
he loved it and whoever came into contact with him walked away with a better experience			0
is n’t that a fabulous way to go out of this world ? ’ our condolences to his wife june and @entity59			0
respect : @entity56 @entity58 captain @entity63 paid tribute to @entity59 legend : @entity3 will be dearly missed by all after losing his battle with cancer			1
