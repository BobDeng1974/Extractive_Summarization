by @entity0 follow @ @ draper_rob there are few more respected voices in world football than @entity4			2
the @entity6 coach does not defer to many in the game , such is the cult following he had grown since turning to management and winning two @entity12 titles , four league titles , three domestic cups in his first five seasons in his new career			0
only one man seemingly has the capacity to make him appear subordinate			2
‘ i was lucky enough to enjoy ( @entity21 ) @entity21 at @entity22 , ’ said @entity4 , the former @entity20 coach , said last week			0
embrace : @entity21 runs over to hug @entity4 after scoring in the @entity24 's last game in charge at @entity22 former colleagues : @entity4 , now @entity6 boss , has been in @entity27 watching @entity21 at the @entity28 ‘ competitively he ’s on a level way above my understanding			1
a player like him is born once a lifetime			0
he always takes the right decisions and i would have been too embarrassed to try to tell him where and how to play			0
’ the watching world would doubtless endorse his words			0
there have been hat - tricks against @entity40 , an impossible goal against @entity42 mimicking @entity43 , and that extraordinary @entity12 final at @entity45 in 2011 where he simply swept aside the best efforts that @entity47 could muster			2
and those are just a handful of his highlights			0
smiling assassin : @entity21 trains with his @entity53 team - mates in @entity54 on friday date with destiny : @entity53 know they are just three games away from their first @entity28 trophy since 1986 star : @entity21 has lit up @entity60 for @entity22 , scoring hundreds of goals for the @entity63 giants match - winner : @entity21 celebrates wildly after scoring in the 2011 @entity12 final against @entity47 and yet greats from yesteryear such as @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity43 made their names at the @entity28			1
so far it has been different for @entity21			0
in 2006 he was too young to make an impact			0
in 2010 he departed @entity73 in tears , with @entity53 dismantled by a vibrant young @entity76 team			1
the following year at the @entity79 in @entity53 the relationship between @entity21 and his home nation reached its nadir			1
@entity53 were knocked out on penalties by @entity82 ; @entity21 was jeered by his own fans			1
it was noted that he did n’t sing the anthem and those who questioned his allegiance claimed he did n’t know the @entity88 had become a global superstar thanks to @entity22 and @entity53 were just a peripheral part of his story			1
made the difference : @entity21 provided a brilliant assist to set up @entity93 versus @entity94 inch perfect : the attacker whipped a sublime free - kick into the top corner against @entity98 not now , however			2
@entity21 is clearly integral to @entity53			1
from the moment he announced himself at this @entity28 with his goal at the @entity101 , to the last - minute winner against @entity103 , to the two goals that perplexed @entity98 and the run and pass that created the decisive goal against @entity94 , @entity21 has been at the heart of this team			1
as for @entity111 , it is tempting to view them as extras in a drama constructed around one man			1
‘ i think he ’s been outstanding , ’ said @entity117 ’s @entity116 when asked about that man			2
‘ obviously he ’s their main man			2
there are many other players to watch but he ’s been outstanding in the games i ’ve watched			2
’ pre-match : @entity21 and his team - mates chat in training ahead of their quarter - final against @entity111 leading the way : @entity21 at the front as @entity53 train in @entity54 before their last - eight match however , @entity132 , the @entity111 coach , appears confident , saying : ‘ people tend to focus on @entity21 , and rightly so , but the team is n’t just one player but a whole			1
' i also saw they left a number of scoring opportunities for @entity94			0
i do n’t think we need to fear anyone			0
we wo n’t adapt to their style			0
it ’s a quarter final and we can write history			2
’ with their array of @entity150 stars , @entity111 could of course stop the story in it tracks			1
@entity94 , a lesser side , managed to frustrate them			0
if @entity155 were to shine , if @entity156 can maintain his imperious demeanour against the greatest player of this generation , if @entity160 can demonstrate more of the raw talent that has led @entity162 to sign him , they surely have a chance			0
joking around : @entity165 gestures to @entity21 during @entity53 's training session at the @entity167 @entity53 have been laboured in this tournament thus far			1
the defence looks chaotic at time ; @entity171 and @entity172 do n’t appear to be able to offer them adequate protection ; @entity93 has been erratic ; @entity175 is misfiring			0
in fact , it is beginning to look a little like @entity21 and 10 others , just as the 1986 side was @entity43 and the rest			0
he is surrounded by some fine players			0
but what lifts this side from being merely good to being excellent is clearly the presence of one man , whose ability and experience is far above anyone else left at this @entity28			1
‘ as in politics , so in football , in @entity53 we are always looking for one man to save us , ’ said @entity189 , the 1986 @entity28 winner last week			1
‘ if we win the @entity28 , the people will crown @entity21 with laurels ; if not it will be a crown of thorns			1
’ training : @entity21 holds @entity165 , who is recovering from injury , steady , and ( right ) practises free - kicks rumours : reports in @entity27 say @entity200 has lost control of the @entity53 dressing room			1

the @entity204 has scored four goals in four matches so far in @entity27
he has been named man of the match in all four @entity28 games
