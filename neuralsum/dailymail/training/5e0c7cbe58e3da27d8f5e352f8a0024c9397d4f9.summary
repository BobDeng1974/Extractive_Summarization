by @entity0 and @entity1 heiress and society ' it ' girl @entity2 caused a stir last year when she revealed that she had spent an unbelievable £ 1m on a crystal bathtub			2
miss @entity2 ‘ dispatched ’ five minions on an expedition up the @entity9 to gather the crystal used to create the state - of - the - art bathtub for her £ 47m @entity13 home , but if you have been inspired by her blinging bathroom you only need to go as far as @entity13 department store @entity16			2
the @entity17 is a tad cheaper too , priced at £ 150,000			1
the @entity20 bath from @entity21 & @entity22 takes over 200 man hours to create and will set you back £ 150,000 the all white crystals appear to give a uniform glitter , but four different types of @entity20 crystals are used to obtain the effect forget paying off the mortgage or putting your children through private school — for £ 150,000 ( or just £ 120,000 for a slightly smaller @entity35 ) craftsmen will laboriously stick 22,000 white @entity20 crystals to a hand - made cast - iron tub for a glittery @entity38 effect			1
@entity21 & @entity22 is the only bathroom company who manufacture exclusively in @entity42 and the bath is made in their @entity45 foundry using traditional methods and employing artisan techniques in every part of the process			1
the claw footed bath is a surefire way to add some glamour to your bathroom , and can be covered in different colours of crystal such as pink , blue or green why not bling up your bathroom with a @entity60 encrusted tub from @entity21 & @entity22 ? the bath is made from cast metal with an enamel interior , and thousands of crystals have been painstakingly applied by hand taking over 200 hundred hours to turn the @entity67 bath into a real object d’art			1
the @entity20 crystals are all white , of four different plates and applied in meticulous fashion , each being individually stuck on by hand to emphasise the light refracting properties of the glass and create a truly sparkling effect			1
@entity2 's extravagant tub is part of the growing trend of bling bathrooms @entity2 's bathtub was created from crystal specially sourced from the @entity9 , and required her bathroom floor to be enhanced to take its weight @entity21 & @entity22 use traditional methods and craftsmanship to create the baths - which are made - to - order @entity21 & @entity22 have also created a bejewelled version of their beautiful ‘ @entity35 ’ bath , which carries the slightly cheaper price tag of £ 120,000			1
four different types of @entity20 crystal are used on the bath as a single size failed to create the right level of razzle - dazzle reflection			1
sticking on thousands of tiny crystals is an unfeasibly intricate process and the craftsmen at @entity103 and @entity22 have come up with a rather ingenious solution			0
they apply the crystals using the end of a pencil covered in @entity108 ! this allows them to individually pick up and place the crystals onto the bath where they are glued into position			0
the baby bath is finished with thousands of a single style of crystal creating a consistent glittering effect			0
and if white is n't your thing , the made - to - order tub can be covered in several shades of @entity20 crystal options , including gold , blue and green crystals			2
personal customisation is available , and @entity21 & @entity22 will painstakingly spell out names or even create crests and logos in different coloured crystals			1
managing director @entity132 says of creating the spectacular , and unusual bath : ' it was to do something exotic			0
we did a job for a princess in the middle east and she was very much into her bling , and that 's where the idea stems from			0
' defending the tubs undeniably hefty price tag @entity132 says : ' if you have the money , you want the bath , then the price is n't the issue ' there is a huge amount of work that goes into it , hundreds of hours , it 's all @entity42 craftsmanship ' it 's a one off ; where are you going to see another one like it ? the reflection off it is just amazing ' the tub is being displayed at the @entity165 showroom in @entity45 , and is also available to buy from @entity16			2
and while you are thinking of upgrading your bath then how about the rest of the bathroom ( chipped tiles or a bargain suite wo n’t cut it next to all those shimmering crystals )			0
why not set your glittering bathtub off with a golden plated sink with crystals on the taps , or , better yet , a @entity20 studded toilet			0
