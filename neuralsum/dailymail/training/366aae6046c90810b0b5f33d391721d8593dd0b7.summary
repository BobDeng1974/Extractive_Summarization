by @entity0 published : 09:49 est , 6 april 2012 updated : 10:01 est , 6 april 2012 in trouble : sgt @entity2 is facing dismissal from the @entity4 after saying he would n't follow orders from @entity6 a military board has recommended dismissal for the @entity9 who wrote on @entity11 that he would not follow orders from president @entity6			1
a @entity4 administrative board found that sergeant @entity2 had committed misconduct with his online campaign against the president			1
after a daylong hearing at @entity18 , @entity19 , board also recommended that @entity2 's discharge from the military be on an other - than - honorable basis			1
that would mean that the disgraced sergeant would lose his benefits and would not be allowed back on any military base			1
@entity2 's lawyers had argued that the 9 - year @entity9 , whose service was to end in four months , was expressing his personal views and exercising his first amendment rights			1
but the @entity4 said it was forced to take action after he declared on @entity11 that he would not follow orders from president @entity6			0
that statement - which @entity2 later clarified to say he would not follow unlawful orders - was part of an online political campaign against the president under the banner of the @entity39			1
@entity2 's defence attorney , @entity9 captain @entity40 , said he was ' surprised and disappointed '			1
' but it was an honour to fight for a hero like sergeant @entity2 and every other @entity9 's right to speak freely , ' captain @entity40 added			1
@entity2 addressed board members during yesterday 's hearing , telling them he loved the @entity4 and wanted to re-enlist , captain @entity40 said			2
captain @entity40 expressed hope that the recommendation would be rejected by the general , saying the case will go forward			0
' the issues are too important for this to end today , ' he said			0
critical : the military has had a policy since the @entity57 of restricting the free speech of servicemen , including criticism of the commander in chief during the hearing , the prosecutor , captain @entity63 , said @entity2 went as far as superimposing images of @entity6 's face on a poster for the movie ' @entity69			1
' he argued that @entity2 's behavior repeatedly violated @entity72 policy that limits the free speech rights of service members , and said he should be dismissed after ignoring warnings from his superiors about his postings			1
the government submitted screen grabs of @entity2 's postings on one @entity11 page he created called @entity39 , which the prosecutor said included the image of @entity6 on the ' @entity69 ' movie poster			2
@entity2 also superimposed @entity6 's image on a poster for ' the @entity88 ' movie that he changed to ' @entity89 , ' the prosecutor said			2
captain @entity63 also said @entity92 comments posted by @entity2 on a @entity11 page used by @entity9 meteorologists were prejudicial to good order and discipline , and could have influenced junior @entity4			1
@entity2 's security clearance was taken away and he has no future in the @entity4 because he ca n't do his job without that clearance , captain @entity63 said			2
' the @entity4 community views the command 's lack of action as some kind of knock on good order and discipline , ' captain @entity63 said			0
' our own people are questioning why this @entity9 is not being held accountable			0
' defensive : sgt @entity2 says he did not mean to be ' disrespectful ' but he believes @entity6 's policies are ' crippling this country ' the military has had a policy since the @entity57 limiting the free speech of service members , including criticism of the commander in chief			1
@entity72 directives say military personnel in uniform can not sponsor a political club ; participate in any tv or radio program or group discussion that advocates for or against a political party , candidate or cause ; or speak at any event promoting a political movement			0
commissioned officers also may not use contemptuous words against senior officials			0
profile : sgt. @entity2 says he is a @entity135 blogger and speaker but adds he does not ' represent the views of the @entity138 ' backed by a team of lawyers and congressmen , @entity2 has said he is fighting for his constitutional rights and should be allowed to stay in the military			1
his lawyers and the @entity145 contend his views are protected by the @entity147			0
' think about how dangerous this could be if the @entity151 government can prosecute you for something you say on your private @entity11 page , ' captain @entity40 said			0
response : sgt @entity2 posted these comments on @entity11 this morning after being told he is facing possible dismissal from the corps @entity2 has said his opinions are his own and has put a disclaimer on his @entity11 page saying so			2
his attorneys argued service members have a right to voice their opinions as long as they do not appear to be presenting their views as being endorsed by the military			0
they say the @entity72 policy is vague and military officials do not understand it			0
representative @entity171 , @entity172 , a @entity4 , wrote a letter to @entity2 's commanding officer stating the sergeant should not face dismissal for an opinion shared by a majority of @entity4			2
mr @entity171 said he was referring to @entity2 's statement that he would not obey unlawful orders			2
representative @entity181 , @entity172 , also expressed support for @entity2			0
@entity2 said his statement about @entity6 was part of an online debate about @entity186 allowing @entity151 troops to be tried for the @entity189 burnings in @entity190			0
in that context , he said , he was stating that he would not follow orders from the president if it involved detaining @entity151 citizens , disarming them or doing anything else that he believes would violate their constitutional rights .			0

sergeant @entity2 found to have committed misconduct over his comments about the president
he faces an other - than - honourable discharge , meaning he will lose benefits and be *barred* from military bases
defence attorney 's claim the @entity9 's first amendment rights have been breached
