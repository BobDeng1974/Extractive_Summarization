@entity1 's new fragrance jack is available exclusively at @entity2 we 've heard of perfume having high notes but @entity1 's new fragrance may be taking that a little too literally			1
@entity7 , a unisex fragrance that launched in @entity2 yesterday , contains a combination of the eccentric presenter 's favourite smells including the class b drug marijuana			1
the actor has had a keen interest in fragrance from a young age , so his latest venture into perfumery comes as no surprise			1
‘ i ’ve been led by my nose all my life , ' he reveals			2
' having aimed it at plates of food , linen , fruit , books , necks , fabric , flesh , flowers , cars and everything else in between , to finally have a perfume of my own , is the realisation of a boyhood dream ’ that is no exaggeration			2
growing up in sub-tropical @entity40 , @entity1 tried bottling gardenia and rose petals in jars of boiling sugar water and buried them in the garden in the mistaken belief that they would magically transform into perfume			1
while his early experiments proved unsuccessful , he never lost is passion for perfume but it took a conversation with handbag designer and friend , @entity56 , to take the first step to making his dream a reality			2
‘ i was in the @entity61 two years ago and @entity56 saw me with my head in a gardenia bush and said , " what are you going to do about that ? ” and i said , “ do you mean psychiatrically ? ” and she said , “ no , have you thought of making a perfume ? ” ' i said , “ it ’s been my dream			2
” she gave me a list of numbers of people to go and see			0
@entity75 , the perfumier , told me i have a very sharp sense of smell , possibly because i ’ve never drunk or smoked			0
’ @entity1 has been interested in perfume for his entire life and says that creating his own fragrance is like realising a boyhood dream with @entity56 on side , @entity1 started work on his perfume in january 2012 , and after two years of hard graft , his boyhood dream has finally been realised			1
‘ two non-stop , chasing - my - tail , steep - learning - curve years later , that dream has become a bottled , labelled and packaged reality , ' he reveals			0
despite his obvious pleasure in finally getting his olfactory dream off the ground , he 's under no illusions about the competitive fragrance market			1
' there are 1,100 perfumes released every year so this is like an old guy releasing a record and hoping people are going to buy it			0
' having never done anything businessy in my life , i think this has been the steepest learning curve for a man in his late 50s as it ’s possible to get			0
’ the perfume includes a draw string bag and a luggage tag that can be personalised for gifts the finished perfume includes all of @entity1 ’s favourite ingredients : lime , marijuana , mandarin , vetiver , pepper , cloves and gardenias			1
deciding on the final edit was n't an easy decision so he enlisted the help of the @entity2 staff and asked the store 's nose , @entity129 , to combine two of his favourite blends			1
‘ our sense of smell is the shortest synaptic leap in the brain to our memory , and every one of these ingredients is like a sensory trigger			0
' i ’ve aspired to create a fragrance that is as lickably more - ish as it is addictive ’ , he says the bottle itself is far simpler than the cocktail of scents : a clear bottle , encased in a red box and a @entity147 draw string bag			2
‘ @entity148 is my favourite colour , and having collected @entity147 flags and bunting since the last century , it was logical to design @entity154 pillar - box red , high gloss packaging , replete with a faded vintage - style calico bunting bag inside the box , to sleeve the bottle			0
' i ’ve always been frustrated when buying perfume at not being able to personalise it , to give to friends			0
so once @entity7 is unwrapped , buyers will find a luggage label attached to the @entity147 bag , ready for them to write a ‘ to ’ and ‘ from ’ message on , as a keepsake ’			0
@entity1 has overseen every last detail of the process - a process that even included designing five windows for @entity2 that he hopes will evoke the quintessential @entity154 creativity of op - artist @entity172 and comedy icons , @entity174 so , after all that effort , is he happy with the finished product ? ‘ @entity7 is my signature in scent , ’ he says , unambiguously			1
we 'll take that as a yes			0
@entity7 is available now exclusively at @entity2 and at @entity182 .			1
