it is no secret that male animals will go to great lengths to pursue a female and can take to extreme measures to hold on to her even if their affection is unrequited			0
but @entity9 scientists have discovered that the innocent - looking male guppy fish has evolved barbs on its penis to force ' unreceptive females ' to mate with it			1
@entity17 research found that claws are used by the male fish to treble the amount of sperm transferred to females who resisted advances			1
@entity9 scientists have discovered that the innocent - looking male guppy fish has evolved barbs on its penis to force ' unreceptive females ' to mate with it the evolutionary biologists believe the species has evolved to benefit males at the expense of females , especially when their mating interests differ			1
@entity34 at the university studied the bizarre clawed genitalia of the fish			0
genitalia differ greatly in animal groups , even among similar species and the research for these difference have baffled scientists for years , although there is a school of thought that says sexual conflict between males and females might be the reason			0
sexual conflict occurs when the fitness interests of males and females differ , which is rooted in differences in egg and sperm sizes			0
males invest less than females in reproduction because sperm is cheap to produce , and larger eggs are most costly to make			0
this difference results in a conflict in which males are interested in mating with as many females possible while females are more selective with their mates			0
ms @entity34 's research shows the male guppy grows claws on its genitals to make it more difficult for unreceptive females to get away during mating			1
the researchers examined the role of a pair of claws at the tip of the gonopodium of the male guppy ( @entity80 ) – essentially the fish ’s penis			2
ms @entity34 said : ' our results show that the claws are used to increase sperm transfer to females who are resisting matings			0
' a @entity9 scientist surgically shaved the barbs off of the penises of some male guppies to investigate the relative advantages of claws for mating with ' unreceptive females '			1
she compared the amount of sperm transferred			2
pictured left is the penis with claws and right the modified guppy genitalia ' this suggests that it has evolved to benefit males at the expense of females , especially when their mating interests differ			1
' the scientists tested two ideas for the function of the claws : one for their role in securing sperm in place at the tip of the gonopodium just before it is inserted into the female and the other for grasping unreceptive or resistant females during mating to aid in sperm transfer			2
ms @entity34 surgically shaved the barbs off of the penises of some male guppies to investigate the relative advantages of claws for mating with ‘ unreceptive females '			1
she compared the amount of sperm transferred by the male fish with a group of males who had n’t been declawed after they had all mated with receptive or unreceptive females			1
ms @entity34 said : ' clawed males transferred up to three times more sperm to unreceptive females compared to declawed males			2
' the claw has evolved to benefit the males at the expense of females , and implicates sexual conflict between the sexes in the diversification of the genitalia in this family of fish			2
' this provides support that this important selective force is behind an evolutionary pattern that evolutionary biologists have been trying to unravel for over a century			0
' the research was published in @entity149 .			0

@entity9 evolutionary scientists say claws are used by the male guppy fish to treble the amount of sperm transferred to *reluctant* females
added the species has evolved to benefit males at the expense of females
