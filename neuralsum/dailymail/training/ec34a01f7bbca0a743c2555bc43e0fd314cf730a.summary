@entity9 died from a massive haemorrhage just hours after he was born prematurely at @entity11 on july 3 last year			1
doctors pierced a soft part of his skull while cutting into the wall of his mother 's womb , causing severe blood loss , an inquest heard			1
grieving : @entity20 died from a massive haemorrhage just hours after he was born prematurely at @entity11 on july 3 last year			1
above , @entity9 's heartbroken parents , @entity23 and @entity24 assistant coroner for @entity26 recorded a verdict of accidental death			1
but she criticised @entity29 for its ' woefully inadequate ' investigation into the tragedy			1
following the hearing on thursday , @entity9 's heartbroken mother @entity23 , 38 , a carer from @entity33 , @entity11 , said she would ' never forgive ' the hospital for her son 's death			1
in a statement released with her partner @entity24 , 37 , after the verdict , she said : ' from start to finish , my care was absolutely horrendous			0
hospital : an inquest heard during a c - section , doctors pierced a soft part of @entity9 's kull while cutting into the wall of his mother 's womb			1
above , the maternity ward at @entity11 , where the newborn died ' i will never forgive them ' : miss @entity23 said she would ' never forgive ' the hospital for her newborn son 's death newborn babies ' skulls consist of five main bones : two frontal bones , two parietal bones , and one occipital bone			1
these are joined by soft spots - or ' fontanelles - which enable the bony plates of their skulls to flex and change shape during birth			2
this allows babies ' heads to pass through the narrow birth canal			0
the ossification of the bones of the skull causes the anterior fontanelle to close by nine to 18 months			0
meanwhile , the sphenoidal and posterior fontanelles close during the first few months of a baby 's life			0
the closures eventually form the sutures of the neurocranium			0
' when i eventually went into labour the doctor did n't seem to believe me but i assured her i was having the baby			0
' for @entity9 's life to end in the way it did is unacceptable			1
during my c - section , the doctor cut my baby 's head so deep that he died			1
i will never forgive them for what they did			0
' during the inquest , @entity99 recalled the heartbreaking moment she found out her baby had died			0
' i woke up and asked @entity24 what we 'd had			0
i could not understand why he was n't happy , ' she said			0
' i heard someone say " he 's had two cardiac arrests " and i felt sorry for the person whose baby it was - then i realised it was my baby			2
' then i heard someone say he had a defect on his head			0
' the inquest heard @entity99 had been 33 weeks pregnant when she went into labour and was taken to @entity11 for an emergency c - section			1
dr @entity120 , assisted by consultant @entity121 , cut into her womb with a scalpel and managed to deliver @entity9 , but then discovered he was haemorrhaging from a wound to his head			2
he was treated in intensive care and given oxygen because he also had underdeveloped lungs , while doctors fought to stop the bleeding			0
but tragically , nothing could be done to save the newborn and he died three hours later			2
mr @entity121 told the inquest that around one per cent of babies suffer cuts during a caesarian section , saying : ' i could not see how a scalpel could cut through bone			0
' but paediatric pathologist dr @entity138 , who conducted the post-mortem , said he thought the doctors had cut into the baby 's skull while cutting through the uterus wall			2
blasted : assistant coroner for @entity26 recorded a verdict of accidental death			1
but she criticised @entity29 for its ' woefully inadequate ' investigation into the tragedy he told the hearing : ' it was at the back end of the temporal bones - made up of five bones that come together			1
' there is a gap between them and there would be no problem opening up a skull with a scalpel blade in that area			0
' the inquest heard that mother - of - two @entity99 underwent a gynaecological procedure to treat heavy periods in 2011 that increased the risk of miscarriage and pre-term labour			2
distraught : miss @entity23 had been 33 weeks pregnant when she went into labour and was taken to @entity11 for an emergency c - section miss @entity23 said that when she found out she was expecting @entity9 in 2013 , she had told doctors she had previously undergone the operation - the exact details of which were not disclosed			1
recording a verdict of accidental death , coroner @entity176 said : ' @entity9 's head was closer to the side of the uterus than normal because of the previous surgery			1
' i want to make this clear - this is not something that happens in a standard caesarean section			2
' following the hearing , the parents ' solicitors @entity188 said it was a ' very tragic case ' and they were considering whether to take further action			0
a statement from the hospital said the surgery was performed by a senior team and the complication was ' extremely rare '			0
dr @entity198 , @entity199 's medical director , said : ' we reiterate our condolences to @entity99 and her family for their loss			0
' @entity9 was delivered by emergency section to maximise his chances of survival			1
' the operation was performed by a senior and competent team of doctors			0
' sadly there were complications that could not have been foreseen			2
' the pathologist concluded that this extremely rare complication caused @entity9 's death			1
' it will never be known whether had this not occurred , @entity9 would have survived			2

@entity9 died from massive hemorrhage just hours after he was born
