a group of disillusioned @entity2 jihadists who wanted to return home after fighting for @entity4 in @entity5 and @entity6 have been taken prisoner by their militant commanders			1
the men were stripped of their weapons and marched to a punishment centre in the militant - held city of @entity14 in @entity6 , according to reports			1
the five @entity2 were accompanied by three @entity16 , two @entity17 and two @entity18			1
they had complained that they were spending their time fighting other rebel forces instead of the government of @entity22 and were concerned that they were killing fellow @entity23			1
but security sources say the new development shows that defectors can not afford to try to bargain with @entity2 authorities and should just ‘ drop their weapons and leave ’			1
until now , is is thought to have operated an open door policy which has allowed around 250 @entity2 to return but the start of @entity42 air attacks has made militant commanders paranoid that spies could direct attacks			1
it means that the formerly welcoming atmosphere for @entity49 militants has now changed to suspicion as the terrorist group begins to turn on its own fighters , according to one security source			0
the map shows the control that the extremist @entity56 group has gained in @entity6 and @entity5 the source said the round - up of @entity59 is a new development and it is ‘ impossible to predict the outcome ’			2
@entity62 , of the counter-extremism think - tank @entity63 , whose members include former fighters , said : ‘ it is very dangerous to expose your identity if you want to come back in case is find out who you are			0
anyone who wants to leave , should just leave			0
’ he said the authorities should still arrest those who have committed crimes abroad , but there also needed to be an option to help reintegrate any who are able to demonstrate that they have ‘ genuinely changed ’			0
it comes after a group of four @entity2 nick - named ‘ the @entity82 ’ are thought to have become so integrated with is that one appeared in videos beheading @entity42 hostages @entity85 and @entity87			2
@entity38 has spent much of its time carving out a caliphate straddling the border of @entity6 and @entity5 , rather than fighting @entity22 ’s forces			1
more than 500 @entity2 have travelled over to join the guerrilla group and around half are thought to have returned , 40 of whom were arrested			2
about 20 @entity2 are believed to have been killed in the civil war in @entity6			1
@entity85 , an experienced @entity42 freelance reporter , was killed by @entity38 thugs after he was kidnapped in @entity6 the grieving mother of a @entity42 journalist beheaded by @entity38 thugs has condemned the @entity100 administration for its lukewarm efforts to save her son			2
@entity103 said she was ‘ embarrassed and appalled ’ by the @entity42 authorities ’ handling of her son @entity106 ’s kidnapping			0
‘ i really feel our country let @entity110 down , ’ she added			0
in an interview with @entity112 on the anniversary of 9/11 , she said her family were even threatened with prosecution if they tried to raise a ransom to free mr @entity85 , 40			0
‘ @entity110 was sacrificed because of just a lack of coordination , lack of communication , lack of prioritisation , ’ she added .			0

the men had their weapons taken and went to the area in @entity14 , @entity6
the five @entity2 were with three @entity16 , two @entity17 and two @entity18
