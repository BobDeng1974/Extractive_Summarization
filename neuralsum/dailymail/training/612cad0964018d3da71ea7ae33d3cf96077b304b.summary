@entity0 , a @entity8 who has permanent residency in @entity11 , developed a special bond with @entity13 and @entity14 over the 10 months he spent in @entity17 's infamous @entity16 jail until he was released on june 24 , 2013			1
the 46 - year - old was instantly embraced and treated like a brother by the reformed drug smugglers and can not imagine having to endure his sentence without their constant love and support			1

@entity0 quit his job as a car salesman in 2012 and headed off on a solo three - month overseas adventure which quickly turned into the holiday from hell			1

when @entity0 explained to the hotel staff that he could not pay his bill they took him to the police station to report the incident when found himself handcuffed			1
after refusing to pay a bribe , he was locked in a cell at the station where he slept on a tiled floor for 60 days			1
following the two months with 13 inmates who did n't speak @entity68 , ironically , @entity0 could n't wait to move into @entity17 's most notorious jail where he was met by @entity14 and another @entity3 member , @entity70			1
the 46 - year - old was instantly embraced and treated like a brother by the reformed drug smugglers an improvised clothesline at the back of the block that @entity0 was confined to for 10 months @entity0 can not imagine having to endure his sentence without their constant love and support from the pair ' they met me at the front door because they had heard through a friend that i was coming , ' he said			1
' i did n't know what to expect when the big doors opened and they welcomed me straight away saying " we 'll come and get you tomorrow morning and tell you what to do and what not to do ''			0
' it was couple of days later that @entity0 was greeted by a smiling and energetic @entity13			1
' he gives 100 per cent everyday - i do n't know how he does it with a death sentence hanging over his head , ' he said			0
' he 's so full of life - positive is the best way to describe him - he just has this aurora that makes you smile and feel happy			0
' @entity0 , who has released the book ' i surivived @entity16 ' about his traumatic ordeal , said @entity14 is the polar opposite to his best mate			1
' @entity13 only has one gear which is straight forward while @entity105 is idle , ' @entity0 said			2

' i had a lot of respect from the @entity40 i was training , ' he said			0
' the gang members would rock up to do boxing so that way they were n't as likely to kill me - plus i did n't take drugs or owe anyone money			0

@entity0 says it hypocritical that his mates are facing a death sentence when the jail is ' full of drugs ' despite the harsh conditions , @entity0 was conflicted about leaving his good mates behind it was so difficult to bid farewell to his close mates that in some way @entity0 wanted to remain living in that harsh world without freedom			1
' it was the worst - i said goodbye to @entity105 in the morning and then @entity13 walked me to the door in the afternoon , ' he said			2
' i will never forget the hug @entity13 gave me - it was so strong and i really felt that bond between us - all of these emotions were going through me			0
' he sent a message to @entity13 about a week ago through a friend of the @entity3 members who visits them regularly			2
' i told him " i have n't stopped thinking about you and i love you as a mate " and he replied with " thanks for your thoughts "			0
' ' the friend said he was in surprisingly good spirits - that 's the type of guy he is			0
' @entity0 was speechless when asked what he would say if he had the opportunity to say goodbye to his dear friends in person			0
