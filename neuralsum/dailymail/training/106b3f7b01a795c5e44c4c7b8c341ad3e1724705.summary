by @entity0 , political reporter and @entity2 , mail online deputy political editor @entity4 was yesterday forced to defend himself after he admitted a vulnerable woman wrote to him to complain about inappropriate advances by mp @entity7 more than three years ago			1
the @entity8 leader acknowledged his office received a letter from the woman in march 2011 begging for help , but denied that he had ‘ turned a blind eye ’ to the problem , claiming that it was never brought to his attention			1
as part of a court settlement on wednesday , mr @entity7 , 68 , admitted he had ‘ crossed the line ’ and had an ‘ inappropriate and unprofessional ’ relationship with the woman after she sought his help as her local mp			1
@entity23 mp , @entity7 admitted he had ' crossed the line ' in his friendship with a vulnerable constituent with mental health problems who had come to him for help mr @entity4 yesterday called on mr @entity7 , who has already had the @entity8 whip withdrawn in @entity30 and his party membership suspended , to leave the party altogether			1
‘ he should resign from the party			2
absolutely , ’ mr @entity4 told @entity33			0
‘ he has made an apology that makes it clear that the way he behaved was totally and utterly out of order			2
he has caused huge , huge distress			1
frankly , that has no role in the @entity8 – the party i lead			1
’ the woman , known as ‘ @entity42 ’ , first wrote to the deputy prime minister on march 9 , 2011 to complain about mr @entity7			1
in a letter sent by recorded delivery to the @entity8 headquarters , she wrote : ‘ i am deeply upset that as the deputy prime minister and leader of the @entity8 you have done nothing to oust this man from politics			1
the former @entity8 mp - who is now sitting as an independent - caused ' huge , huge distress ' , @entity4 claimed today ‘ he can not be trusted and he is a liability to women , the public and also your party			1
his conduct should be a matter for you as leader of the party			2
please reply to this as it is very important to me that i get an answer from you			0
’ the woman , who also believes she was ' bullied ' during her battle , first went to the @entity23 mp with concerns about noisy neighbours in 2009			1
her teenage son , who has stood by her during the campaign for justice , welcomed the apology and said his mother had ' been very strong '			1
the teenager said : ' i think justice has been served and it 's enough for me			0
but the apology does n't account for the last four years			1
' my mum has been very strong , and we have gone through ups and downs together			0
i think @entity7 should stand down from the @entity8 permanently and as an mp			1
' a full statement from the woman said : ' i 'm pleased there 's been a resolution to what 's been a long and hurtful ordeal for me			0
' since the incidents about which i complained happened back in 2010 , my physical and mental health have suffered and i 'm grateful that i may now have some closure to this traumatic episode in the lives of both me and my son			0
' i 'm pleased the defendant now recognises that i did not bring the case for financial gain			0
' i only ever sought justice and an apology from mr @entity7			1
and that is what my legal team fought to obtain throughout			0
' some @entity8 councillors serving on @entity106 have sought publicly to discredit myself and my motives for bringing an action against mr @entity7 , ignoring and even trying to undermine the independent investigation report commissioned by their own @entity111 @entity110			1
' finally , i 'd urge anyone else who has suffered from unwarranted approaches where someone particularly in public office , has abused their trust to come forward			2
' in 2011 , a @entity119 woman accused of being a spy admitted having a four - year affair with @entity7 while she worked as his researcher			1
@entity123 ( right ) revealed the relationship in court in 2011 as she successfully fought deportation after it was claimed she targeted the mp as part of a ‘ honeytrap ’ operation			1
during her time working with @entity7 , she even moved into his @entity132 flat			1
earlier that year , @entity7 admitted having a ‘ close and affectionate relationship ’ with a 17 - year - old girl			1
the pair met at his office when she inquired about undertaking work experience			2
‘ it was a very affectionate relationship – it was strong but not sexual , ’ he said			0
‘ there was contact between us – a kiss and cuddle but no more than that			0
’ in 2010 it was claimed that @entity7 had helped another @entity119 woman , 25 - year - old @entity146 , to stay in @entity147 after she ran into visa problems in the @entity149			1
miss @entity146 ’s ex-husband said the mp went out of his way to help the blonde after she paid several visits to his office			2
@entity7 was also accused of having two affairs with colleagues during the @entity156 and @entity149			2
the marriage of @entity158 ( right ) , a @entity8 councillor and a mother of three , broke up as a result of their relationship			1
‘ i had heard about his reputation for women which goes before him in the party , ’ she said			0
@entity7 was also said to have had a six - year affair with @entity170 , his constituency secretary			2
she told a newspaper : ‘ he ’s no great looker , he ’s not @entity174 ’s gift to women , but he charms his way in			0
’ there have also been allegations that @entity7 had a relationship with @entity178 , 20 , whom he met during an aid trip to a village near @entity181 in october 1990			2
she claimed : ‘ we were very close			0
i miss him very much			0
he ’s a kind and charming man			0
he came on many trips , first in october 1990 , then @entity186 that year , then in january , march and april or may			0
i saw him each time			0
’ mr @entity4 yesterday said the party had taken no action at that time as @entity189 and the @entity190 , which had both looked into the matter , had decided there was no basis on which to proceed			2
he claimed : ‘ she is quite right to say back in 2011 something was sent to my office			0
it did n’t reach me			0
when i was given specific allegations early in 2013 , i responded as promptly as i reasonably could and @entity7 was suspended as an mp for the party			1
’ yesterday it emerged that the @entity23 mp has taken £ 275,077 in salary from the public purse and a further £ 72,004 in expenses since the woman complained to mr @entity4			2
politicians in @entity106 have called on mr @entity7 to quit and trigger a by - election			1
@entity208 councillor @entity207 said : ‘ his position is completely untenable			0
there is no way people in @entity106 can trust him as their mp			0
’ however mr @entity7 will not face an investigation by the parliamentary sleaze watchdog			2
this means that he could cling on until next year ’s election – putting pressure on the government to introduce reforms allowing constituents to recall rogue mps			0
conservative mp @entity223 said : ‘ this clearly shows we need recall			0
it ’s absurd that unless he chooses to step down , his constituents are stuck with him			0

@entity8 leader admits his office received complaints about @entity7
but he *insists* he was never shown the letter and did not ' turn blind eye '
deputy *pm* says @entity7 has caused ' huge distress ' and should resign
former mp admitted yesterday he had ' crossed the line ' with constituent
vulnerable mother today spoke of her ' relief ' over court settlement with mp
but she said she had ' wasted four years of my life ' over battle for apology
@entity7 still an mp and can not be kicked out until the next election in 2015
