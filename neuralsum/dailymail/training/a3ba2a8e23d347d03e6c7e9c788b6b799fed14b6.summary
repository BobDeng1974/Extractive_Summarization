click here to read how the @entity2 plans to pip @entity3 to the post in @entity5 @entity6 offered @entity3 his hand , and he stared at it as if it had come from @entity10 , not from the friend of his racing youth			1
at least boxers look each other in the eye at the weigh - in , even if they are chewing and snarling			2
but @entity3 found it hard even to meet @entity6 ’s gaze when they came together for the traditional handshake of title contenders ahead of thursday ’s press conference			1
@entity6 was the more chipper of the pair			1
shoulders back , a swagger in his step			2
he took the initiative in putting out his paw			2
he has nothing to lose			2
he is already second in the table , 17 points behind his @entity34 colleague going into sunday ’s @entity35			1
@entity6 ( right ) believes he can beat @entity3 to the championship at the final race in @entity5 @entity6 claims that his @entity34 team - mate has been ' making some mistakes ' recently the title challengers finally appeared to shake hands properly during the drivers ' press conference 1			1
@entity3 - 334 points 2			1
@entity6 - 317 points @entity3 will be crowned world champion if he finishes second in the season - ending @entity35 , even if @entity6 wins the race			1
if the final race was a ‘ normal ’ race with 25 points for the winner , rather than the double points on offer , @entity3 would be able to claim his second drivers ’ title with a sixth - place finish			1
perhaps he felt renewed confidence after his win in @entity58 a fortnight ago			2
it was maybe the best win of his career and one of the few occasions he has beaten @entity63 in an absolutely straight fight			0
@entity3 insisted he was not nervous but , if i had a pound for every championship leader who has tried to kid himself into believing that on the eve of the deciding race , i could almost afford a lemonade in the opulent @entity73 hotel overlooking the track			1
this tension stalked the final pre-race press conference of the season — always the most intense all year			0
on thursday , the camera lenses chattered like cicada on the @entity80			0
it was a far cry from their carefree days as young karters in @entity84			0
half their lifetimes ago they were in @entity87 with @entity88 , a great karting talent lost to @entity90 after a rallying accident			1
@entity88 recalled : ‘ they would even have races to eat pizza , always eating two at a time			0
’ as @entity88 told the @entity100 : ‘ they always wanted to win , to beat each other			0
there was always laughing afterwards			0
’ @entity3 and @entity6 ate vanilla ice cream in the middle of the night , wrestled and slept in the same room			1
‘ probably the first bit of real competition we had was when @entity6 used to ride a unicycle everywhere , ’ said @entity3			1
‘ so i thought , “ i ’ve got to learn to ride this unicycle			0
i ’ve got to be better than him			0
” i spent all my time outside the go - kart learning to ride this unicycle			2
’ ah , they were more innocent days , before the on - track skirmishes of this campaign			2
@entity6 takes his place on the podium after beating @entity3 to victory at the @entity120 @entity35 the two @entity34 drivers , pictured in @entity122 , will be fighting for double points at @entity5 @entity3 and @entity6 's relationship has become strained despite knowing each other since childhood click here to read why @entity128 thinks it will be a joke if @entity3 does n't win the drivers ' title on thursday , @entity3 , wearing a white cap with a @entity133 on the underside of the peak , struggled to smile such was the burden on him			1
his answers were polite but short			0
this is largely understandable : he is on the verge of one of the biggest days of his life and he considers reporters ’ questions to be unwelcome hoops to jump through en route to the grid on sunday			0
yet despite the world ’s glare , he said : ‘ i generally feel it ’s quite similar to back in the karting days			0
‘ at that age it was as intense as i had experienced			0
i wanted to win back then and nothing ’s changed			0
’ @entity6 , separated on the dais from his old buddy by @entity155 , was not in total agreement , saying : ‘ it ’s quite amazing to think now that 15 years later we ’re actually in the position we used to dream about : to be in the best @entity90 team , fighting for the championship , fighting for the race wins			1
‘ it is more intense now			0
there is more surrounding it — that ’s the best way to put it			0
’ before the official press conference , the two men conducted their respective media briefings on opposing sides of the @entity34 hospitality area			1
@entity6 spoke in @entity2 , with his assistant @entity173 , a former @entity174 journalist , watching on intently			1
the separation — one drivers ’ huddle in one place , the other ’s nearby — was reminiscent of @entity3 ’s first @entity90 championship fight			1
debris flies in the air as @entity6 and @entity3 's @entity34 controversially make contact at @entity122 @entity35 @entity184 will leave @entity185 to be replaced by @entity186 at the end of the season @entity184 , whose departure from @entity185 to be replaced by @entity186 was confirmed , would plot and scheme with his @entity192 reporter pals ; @entity3 would speak to us @entity195 hacks			1
the level of skulduggery is certainly less overt this time round			0
@entity6 , ruthless though he can be , is the modern company man down to his neat fingernails and would never let off grenades the way @entity184 did			1
and @entity3 , headstrong though he can be , does not have a machiavellian mind			1
but there is still some serious niggle			0
as they left here in the dusk of the desert night , @entity6 went to be with his wife @entity209 , who will be joined at the track by a few of his friends			2
it is @entity6 ’s usual entourage			2
@entity3 left with his @entity216 trainer @entity215			2
neither his father nor mother is here			0
his girlfriend @entity219 is also absent , as she has been all season			0
it is doubtful anyone concerned got an uninterrupted night ’s sleep			0
@entity224 backs @entity3 to clinch title			2

@entity90 drivers ' championship will be decided in @entity35
@entity3 leads his @entity34 team - mate @entity6 by 17 points
@entity233 must finish second if @entity6 wins *due* to double points on offer
