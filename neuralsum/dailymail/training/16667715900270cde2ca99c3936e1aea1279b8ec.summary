by @entity0 published : 04:53 est , 22 march 2012 updated : 05:23 est , 22 march 2012 the first commercial round - trips to @entity2 will blast off within 10 years , according to @entity4 co-founder @entity3 , ceo of @entity6 commercial rocket maker @entity5			1
the trip will cost a cool $ 500,000 ( £ 300,000 ) - entirely payable through @entity4 , no doubt			0
in 2010 , @entity5 became the first commercial company in history to launch a spacecraft into orbit and retrieve it , and has partnered with @entity13 to carry out cargo deliveries to the @entity15			1
red alert : @entity5 is confident it can take paying passengers to @entity2 within 10 years @entity5 launched its @entity18 into orbit atop a falcon 9 rocket on december 8 , 2010 @entity3 told the @entity21 that he 's confident his company will soon be able to go even further and send paying customers to the @entity2 , which lies around 140,000,000 miles away , possibly within 10 years - thanks to technology breakthroughs dramatically lowering the costs of space missions			1
he said : ‘ land on @entity2 , a round - trip ticket - half a million dollars			1
‘ my vision is for a fully reusable rocket transport system between @entity32 and @entity2 that is able to re-fuel on @entity2 , so you do n't have to carry the return fuel when you go there			1
‘ the whole system [ must be ] reusable - nothing is thrown away			0
' at present , he said , the technologies needed to pull off such a grand venture have n't been patented , so he remained tight - lipped about the precise methods @entity5 would use			1
but he added : ‘ we will probably unveil the overall strategy later this year in a little more detail			2
i 'm quite confident that it could work			0
’ at present @entity5 is preparing for a test flight in which it will attempt to send its @entity48 spacecraft to the @entity49			2
the unmanned craft was due to fly to the @entity15 on february 7 - carrying a payload of non-essential supplies in case of failure			0
but this was postponed to allow for more engineering tests			0
@entity5 's @entity18 will fly within two miles of the space station , for a checkout of all its systems			2
then it will close in , with station astronauts grabbing the capsule with a robotic arm			0
@entity48 ultimately will be released for a splashdown in the @entity64			0
@entity5 has said that it aims for manned flights by 2014 .			2

@entity3 , ceo of @entity5 , will *announce* @entity2 strategy later this year
