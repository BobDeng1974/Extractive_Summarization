it was n’t just @entity2 ’s astonishing arrival in 1975 as a baby with blue skin that shocked doctors			1
the 37 - year - old descended from an extraordinary family in @entity8 - and although the colour soon diminished from him , his lips and fingernails still went blue when he became cold or angry as a child			1
he came from an isolated family whose members were born with a condition that discoloured them , as a result of a coincidental meeting of recessive genes , intermarriage and inbreeding in the 1800s			1
family history : @entity2 , 37 , left , of @entity23 , @entity24 , is descended from a isolated eastern @entity8 family with an extraordinary colour defect the story began when @entity29 orphan @entity28 settled on the banks of @entity31 to claim a land grant in the early 19th century and married a red - haired woman named @entity34			1
she had a very pale complexion - and their union brought on the ‘ methaemoglobinaemia ’ genetic mutation , also known as met - h , which reduces an individual ’s ability to carry oxygenated blood			1
@entity46 - based blood expert dr @entity44 said the whole story is ‘ fascinating ’ and shows how society and disease can intersect - as well as the ‘ danger of misinformation and stigmatisation			0
’ ‘ if i carry a bad recessive gene with a rare abnormality and married , the child probably would n't be sick , because it 's very rare to meet another person with the ( same ) bad gene , ’ he told @entity53			2
mr @entity2 was born and taken to the @entity59 , where doctors were amazed by his blue skin and quickly prepared a blood transfusion before his grandmother butted in			2
heritage : mr @entity2 came from a family born with a condition that made them discoloured , as a result of a coincidental meeting of recessive genes , intermarriage and inbreeding in the 1800s ( colourised photo ) couples : @entity2 is pictured with his wife @entity74 , left , and his parents @entity76 and @entity77 are seen right she explained that he looked like his ancestors in @entity31 and his great - grandmother @entity79 , who died aged 84 , was once called ‘ the bluest woman i ever saw ’ , reported @entity53			1
' if i carry a bad recessive gene with a rare abnormality and married , the child probably would n't be sick , because it 's very rare to meet another person with the ( same ) bad gene ' dr @entity44 , blood expert @entity89 tracked down mr @entity2 to the @entity90 in @entity23 , where he now works as a water plant supervisor			1
he gained a wildlife management degree from @entity93			0
the @entity95 family tree shows @entity28 and @entity34 had a blue boy called @entity97 who married his mother ’s sister			1
their son named @entity102 married into a nearby family and they had eight children			2
one of these children was @entity79 , who married @entity107 and had 13 children			0
@entity2 comes from this family line , reported @entity53			2
his mother @entity110 , 56 , lives in @entity111 , @entity8			0
there are other relatives in the @entity77 line still alive in @entity115 and @entity116			0
@entity89 found mr @entity2 has a wife named @entity118 in @entity24 and they appear to have four children			2
rural : the @entity120 lived in an isolated part of eastern @entity8 and had little opportunity to mix with others diagram : @entity125 is a recessive gene ( shown by the small r ) , so rarely produces ' blue ' people as eastern @entity8 has become vastly more populated than the early 19th century , and as more genes are married into the @entity28 family tree , there were far fewer children born with the condition			1
' @entity133 was just as blue as @entity134 on a cool summer day ' dr @entity136 on seeing @entity137 , a descendant of @entity95 branch the blue people in @entity8 began to disappear in the early 20th century as families moved apart and the disease therefore became less common as inbreeding reduced , reported @entity53			0
looking at the old family portrait , they appear to have been either photoshopped or made up to mimic characters from children 's cartoon the @entity146 , but science proves that the condition is real			0
the family was first discovered in 1958 when @entity137 , who was a descendant of another branch of the @entity120 , took his white wife to a hospital and doctors ended up paying more attention to him			0
‘ @entity133 was just as blue as @entity134 on a cool summer day , ’ dr @entity136 said in 1974			0
fortunately for the sufferers , there are no serious problems associated with the disease .			0

isolated family in @entity8 started producing blue children in 1800s
@entity29 orphan @entity28 married pale @entity164 @entity34
genetic mutation reduces individual ’s ability to carry oxygenated blood
intermarriage led to ' pure ' gene pool which often met ' met - h ' gene
@entity24 @entity2 's fingernails *&* lips sometimes turned blue as child
