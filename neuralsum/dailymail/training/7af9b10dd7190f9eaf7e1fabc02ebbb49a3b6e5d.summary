it took just four minutes for @entity1 to serve a reminder of his worth			1
thrown on with an attacking remit during @entity7 ’s @entity6 opener against @entity8 , he rose inside the penalty area , twisting his awkward frame and using his bushy barnet to flick home the equalising goal in a 2 - 1 victory – it was classic @entity1 , a vintage not witnessed since his time at @entity18			1
after 10 months without a goal for club or country , perhaps this was the turning point in his faltering career			0
for @entity26 boss @entity39 had already decided that @entity1 was not for him			1
the 26 - year - old is available for transfer at @entity42 , chief executive @entity43 having been instructed by the new @entity45 manager to offload last summer ’s £ 27.5million signing			0
it charts the sorry demise of a player once feared by @entity51 defences			0
and therein lies the accelerating factor behind @entity1 ’s failure			2
dud : @entity1 struggled to make an impact following £ 27.5m move from @entity18 ruthless : @entity39 has made it clear which players he wants when he takes charge at @entity26 @entity60 will rebuild @entity26 - @entity61 for @entity64 – the man who took @entity1 with him to @entity26 and knew his merits more than anyone – never once deployed him as a second striker , the role in which he had excelled , inspired and intimidated for the @entity18			1
instead , he was used as a holding midfielder , a position which exposed his shortcomings as a ball player , completely negating the effectiveness of his size , athleticism and hunger for goals			0
he was so poor in the @entity78 quarter - final exit to @entity79 that one foreign newspaper refused to even rate his performance			1
yet @entity1 never protested , seemingly content to drift through the campaign			2
even when criticism became concentrated on the @entity84 , @entity64 refused to reposition his flop			0
the @entity87 ’s stubbornness was staggering			0
not so champion : @entity1 was so poor in one game against @entity79 that a foreign newspaper refused to give him a rating indeed , there was an interesting exchange between former @entity26 defender @entity94 – not thought to have been a fan of @entity64 – and @entity97 presenter @entity96 during coverage of @entity7 ’s second - round victory over @entity100			1
@entity94 offered : ‘ i think his ( @entity1 ) best position is off the frontman			2
at @entity18 we played against him numerous times			2
i saw him play against @entity108 , @entity109 , his best games in an @entity18 shirt were off the frontman			2
‘ he 's difficult to play against			0
he gets that ball into him , he 's awkward , he puts his arms everywhere , and that 's where he 's most effective for me			0
’ @entity96 replied : ‘ hence why he did n't fit in at @entity26 because he never got the chance to play there ? ’ to which @entity94 came back : ‘ well i think you play players in their best positions and i think his best games for @entity18 were up there , causing problems for centre halves			1
’ @entity1 has started each of @entity7 ’s three matches since his game - changing impact against @entity8			1
like @entity64 , however , @entity131 has used him in a midfield berth and again he has struggled to exert any influence			0
but @entity60 , it would appear , had determined @entity1 ’s fate before the tournament began			1
@entity1 made just 16 starts for @entity26 and five more from the bench , failing to score in any of those			1
@entity64 paid the price and was sacked			0
it is likely that @entity1 will follow him out of the door .			0

new boss @entity60 has told @entity26 to sell midfielder
@entity1 has failed to make an impact since *joining* from @entity18
he has played in @entity7 's last three games at @entity148 and looks set to take on @entity149 in *saturday* 's quarter - final
