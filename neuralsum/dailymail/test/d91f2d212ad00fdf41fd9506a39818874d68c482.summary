@entity0 had four different scorers on sunday			1
at the start of the season i do n’t think anyone would have thought that quartet would be anywhere near the team , let alone scoring vital goals in a huge @entity11 derby			2
with all that money flashing around you would have picked @entity14 over @entity15 , @entity16 over @entity17 and just about anybody over @entity19 and @entity20			1
but all four have proved their worth			0
people said @entity15 was too slow but his brain is certainly quick enough			2
@entity19 is now @entity0 ’s go - to guy and @entity17 has improved			1
@entity15 celebrates after scoring against @entity26 , and he is part of @entity29 's ' fab four ' @entity20 is another player that few would have expected to be a key part of @entity33 's plans @entity19 has become @entity0 's go - to player in midfielder this season @entity17 has improved and despite the summer spending he remains a key aprt of the team as for @entity20 , who would have thought he would become one of @entity0 ’s most consistent players ? it just shows how @entity29 works			1
he does n’t care about names — he wants to pick the right person at the right time and give everyone a chance			0
the only potential problem would be a @entity50 injury			0
he has been instrumental in @entity0 ’s revival			2
as for @entity53 , i feel for him because he seems a good guy but this could be the final straw			0
@entity33 does n’t care about names — he wants to pick the right person at the right time and give a chance the only potential problem would be a @entity50 injury as he has been instrumental in @entity0 ’s revival @entity61 goals will make james a star we 've heard a lot about @entity65 and he was one of my 10 players to watch at the start of the season			1
he is a fantastic young player with fine technique and an excellent set - piece			0
but it ’s incredible that the penalty he scored on saturday was only his second goal in 85 games for @entity76			0
he grew up idolising @entity77 and @entity78 but they did not just provide , they scored too			0
@entity65 was one of my 10 players to watch at the start of the season and he scored this weekend now he has to go up a level and try and emulate his heroes by scoring goals on a regular basis			1
if he does that , he could well be one of the young @entity89 stars fighting for a midfield place at @entity91			0
@entity92 grew up idolising @entity77 ( right ) and @entity78 ( centre ) , he must score like them my tip for @entity92 from august 2014 as one of my 10 players to watch this season 1998 - the last time all three promoted teams were relegated the following season was in 1997 - 98			1
relegation rivals with @entity100 ’s last - minute win and @entity101 unlucky to lose against @entity102 , it ’s all becoming very tight at the bottom			0
the three promoted teams are all in the relegation zone as it stands but i ’ve got a sneaky feeling one of them will get out of it			1
and here ’s a good omen for them			0
only once before in @entity112 history have all three promoted teams gone straight back down and that happened 17 seasons ago			1
@entity101 were unlucky to lose against @entity102 but i ’ve got a feeling one of the promoted teams will survive @entity118 when @entity121 went on loan to @entity123 , his first photo shoot caused quite a stir			1
there was barely a hint of a smile and plenty of people wondered if he really wanted to be there			0
now he looks like he ’s loving life under @entity134			0
he is a good player , has scored a few goals and suits how @entity134 wants to play			2
i would not be surprised if he made the switch permanent			0
@entity121 looks like he ’s loving life under @entity134 and he suits the way the manager plays @entity143 's @entity142 @entity145 ’s free - kick was one of the finest set - piece goals we ’ve seen all season			1
it feels like a lot of free - kicks have gone flying in this campaign and i wondered if the referee ’s vanishing spray was having a big impact			1
but even with the spray , which is a good addition , there has n’t been a big change in terms of successful free - kicks , as our table shows			1
@entity145 ’s free - kick against @entity164 was one of the finest set - piece goals we ’ve seen all season @entity145 's was good but there has n’t been a big change in successful free - kicks , as our table shows 4 - in 29 games this season , @entity169 has four goals			1
in his last 77 @entity174 games he only scored three			0
@entity175 starts to @entity176 in @entity169 has been one of the main reasons behind @entity174 ’s incredible run of form this year			2
alongside @entity180 and @entity181 he has formed an incredibly potent attacking trio			0
everything he does happens at blistering speed and he absolutely terrorises defenders			1
he ’s such a tricky player and quite old - fashioned in the way he hugs the touchline and takes defenders on			2
but the very best wide men do n’t just create goals , they score them as well			2
if he keeps firing them in like he did at @entity194 , then his value is only going to go up			0
@entity169 has been one of the main reasons behind @entity174 ’s incredible run of form this year homegrown stars @entity198 and @entity199 have been the two breakthrough players of the year and in positions where their clubs needed reinforcements			1
@entity198 has become such a strong presence in @entity206 ’s midfield and @entity199 is a striking star for @entity207			1
it just goes to show you do n’t always have to go out and spend huge money to solve a problem			2
the answer can be right under your nose			0
@entity199 's progress goes to show you do n’t always have to go out and spend huge money to solve issues @entity216 that was a big win for @entity218 at @entity219			1
it gave @entity221 some vital points and he also proved a point to his old employers			0
but how much has really changed at @entity207 ? if it were n’t for @entity199 , there would be some serious criticism heading their way — as the table below shows , they have not improved on last year			1
it is still a young team and they have time on their side but yet again their season is over sooner than it should be			0
@entity218 enjoyed @entity221 's win at @entity219 , it proved a point and earned vital league points true masters i was lucky enough to go @entity244 this week to watch some of the golf and it was fantastic to see how hard all the players work			0
plenty of footballers fancy themselves as golfers but these guys show just how dedicated you must be to be the best .			2

@entity0 beat @entity26 4 - 2 at @entity254 on sunday
@entity20 , @entity19 , @entity15 and @entity17 scored
not many would have expected them to be key men for @entity29
@entity65 can reach the top if he adds goals to his game
i 've got a sneaky feeling one of the promoted teams will survive
@entity121 looks happy at @entity123 and he could move permanently
@entity145 scored one of the free - kicks of the season against @entity164
@entity169 is terrorising defenders with his blistering speed
@entity198 and @entity199 show clubs do *n't* need to spend big
have @entity207 really improved this season under @entity278 ?
@entity280 showed just how dedicated you must be to be the best
