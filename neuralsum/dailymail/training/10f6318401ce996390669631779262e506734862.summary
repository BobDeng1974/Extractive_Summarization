@entity0 faced calls to ' come clean ' about @entity3 's failure to tackle tax evasion while he was city minister in the wake of revelations @entity7 helped 7,000 wealthy @entity8 avoid millions of pounds in tax			1
@entity8 's biggest bank is alleged to have used its @entity12 private banking arm to help their super-rich clients , including celebrities and royalty , to evade tax and also advised them how to stay one step ahead of @entity8 tax law			1
the @entity19 and @entity20 seized on the revelation to question the role of mr @entity0 , who was city minister from may 2006 to june 2007			1
but @entity3 responded with questions about why former @entity7 boss @entity24 was appointed a @entity19 peer and trade minister by @entity27			1
the @entity19 and @entity20 said the revelations raised questions about the role of @entity3 's @entity0 , who was city minister from may 2006 to june 2007			1
the man in charge of @entity7 at the time , @entity24 , was made a @entity33 and appointed to the government the banking documents which form the expose have now become the biggest banking leak in history , @entity35 reported			1
among them are the revelations @entity7 's @entity12 bank allowed its clients to withdraw bricks of cash , allowed clients to conceal undeclared ' black accounts ' and gave accounts to criminals and corrupt businessmen			1
@entity50 says that £ 135million in tax , interest and penalties has now been paid by those who hid their assets in @entity12			1
@entity7 claims that since the documents were leaked , it has radically overhauled its private banking business and reduced the number of @entity12 accounts by almost 70 per cent since 2007			1
it was revealed after a whistleblower leaked details of 30,000 accounts holding £ 78billion between 2005 and 2007 , with a quarter said to be held by @entity8			2
@entity65 stars , royalty , @entity68 's richest families as well as relatives of dictators and people implicated in cases of @entity74 corruption are also said to held an account to help them evade tax			2
in one example , @entity7 's @entity12 bankers were prepared to help @entity79 - a man later convicted of dealing in blood diamonds			1
coalition ministers sought to pin the blame for the failure to act on the last @entity3 government , pointing the finger at mr @entity0			2
and former @entity3 minister @entity86 appeared to admit there had been less enthusiasm for clamping down on tax avoidance under @entity90 and @entity91 because there was no shortage of money			1
speaking during a visit to @entity96 , @entity27 said : ' @entity24 was an excellent trade minister , he did a good job			1
but i 'd also add no government has done more than this one to crackdown on tax evasion and aggressive tax avoidance			0
' i put it absolutely at the head of my @entity106 agenda , to make sure there 's more tax transparency , the big companies pay their taxes properly and that we raise money from people previously evading and avoiding tax and will go on doing that as a government			2
' prime minister @entity27 , pictured today at @entity116 in @entity96 , defended his government 's record on tackling tax evasion deputy prime minister @entity120 said : ' i think it would be great if @entity0 for once or @entity122 would get up and admit that they let the banks run riot on their watch			1
‘ @entity0 went on a prawn cocktail charm offensive to suck up to the banks and they now have the brass neck to somehow constantly accuse this government of not doing enough			0
’ the @entity20 leader claimed his party had warned mr @entity91 and mr @entity0 that the lack of proper bank regulation was ' going to end in a car crash '			2
he told @entity137 's today programme : ' @entity0 went on a prawn cocktail charm offensive to suck up to the banks , yet they now have the brass neck to somehow constantly accuse this government of not doing enough when we 've done considerably more to try and straighten out the banks than @entity3 ever did			1
@entity3 mp @entity86 said there was less pressure to tackle tax avoidance when the public finances ' were not under such tension ' ' so , actually , i think it would be very helpful if he actually for once came clean and was honest about the fact that the banks went awry on all sorts of fronts during @entity3 's term in office			1
' conservative treasury minister @entity156 said @entity157 ' throws a spotlight on the opportunities for tax evasion on the eve of the financial crash in 2007 '			2
‘ clearly @entity7 have got questions to answer , ’ he said			0
‘ in terms of @entity24 , i do n’t think there is any suggestion or any evidence that he was involved or engaged in some of the behaviour that occurred in the subsidiary in @entity12			2
’ he added : ' it is for @entity7 to explain what they did to ensure their clients complied with the tax law			2
but it is for the city minister in years up to 2007 , @entity0 , to make an urgent statement about what he knew about all this and why the then government allowed tax avoidance and evasion to take place on such a scale			1
' since 2010 we have closed many of the loopholes exposed in this report and specifically taken action to get back money lost in @entity193			0
' mrs @entity86 , the chairman of the @entity194 , said @entity50 had not been sufficiently determined in tackling dodgy practices			2
she told @entity137 ' : ' if it had been a benefit cheat it would have been up for court years ago			0
now we have had only one tax cheat taken before the @entity8 courts			0
' but she admitted that many of the activities took place while @entity3 was in power			0
' i think that times have changed and we have to move on			0
you have to remember in times past public finances were not under such tension , there were n't so many demands on them , you did n't have the deficit			0
' the man in charge of @entity7 at the time , @entity24 , was made a @entity33 and appointed to the government			1
lord @entity24 was made a minister eight months after @entity50 had been given the leaked documents from his bank			1
he served as a minister of trade and investment until 2013			0
lord @entity24 told @entity157 : ' as a matter of principle i will not comment on the business of @entity7 past or present			2
' mr @entity0 said : ' there are very serious questions for @entity228 and @entity27 to answer today			0
' why , in the five years since this government was first given information about how @entity7 helped people evade tax , has there only been one prosecution out of 1100 individuals identified ? ' and why did they appoint the chairman of @entity7 as a @entity19 minister eight months after the government was told about the bank 's activities ? ' nobody will fall for yet more desperate distraction tactics from @entity228 and the @entity19 when it is clear that this information was first given to the government in 2010			1
' that is why the chancellor should come to the @entity246 and answer questions about this today			0
' in an urgent question in the @entity250 , shadow treasury minister @entity248 asked what information the @entity251 had sought from him about the claims of tax avoidance made in 2010 before he was made a minister			1
any failure to do so would be an ' inexplicable and inexcusable abdication of responsibility ' , she told mps			0
she said : ' we need much more detail ... as to what the government has been up to since they were made aware of this information			0
' who had seen it in 2010 , she asked , and what was done with it ? were ministers informed , she continued , and if not why ? ' any failure by this government to question him [ @entity24 ] before his appointment would be an inexplicable and inexcusable abdication of responsibility , ' she went on			2
labour leader @entity122 told @entity277 : ' i think this is a very serious situation and the government has some serious questions to answer			0
' mrs @entity86 claimed @entity24 faced ' serious questions '			2
' either he did n't know and he was asleep at the wheel , or he did know and he was therefore involved in dodgy tax practices , ' mrs @entity86 said			0
' either way he was the man in charge and i think he has got really important questions to answer			0
' however , @entity3 frontbencher @entity287 insisted revelations about @entity7 did not emerge until 2010 , so it was not something that mr @entity0 could have taken action on			1
@entity7 is alleged to have helped wealthy customes hide their cash and assets from the government to avoid paying their full tax bills shadow financial secretary to the treasury @entity297 said : ' @entity50 were made fully aware of these practices back in 2010			1
there are serious questions for the chancellor to answer about why just one person out of over a thousand have been prosecuted in five years			0
' and why the government 's @entity12 tax deal has been such an embarrassing flop , raising a fraction of the amounts initially boasted of by ministers			2
' ' tax avoidance and evasion harms every taxpayer in @entity8 , and undermines public services like the @entity313			0
' offshore accounts are not illegal but they are often used as a way of hiding earnings from @entity50			1
however , deliberately hiding money to evade tax is illegal			0
but even though 1,100 people who had not paid what they should have done were identified , five years later only one person has been prosecuted			1
@entity7 has today admitted wrongdoing in @entity12 but said that it has now ' fundamentally changed ' since then			2
claims the bank routinely used its @entity12 operations to help clients shield their true value from the taxman were revealed by a @entity157 investigation			0
it found @entity7 helped clients to hide money from domestic tax authorities in secret ' black ' accounts			1
accounts were held by the rich and powerful , as well as criminals and corrupt businessmen			0
@entity337 's staff allowed clients to withdraws large bundles of cash and emails reveal they were aware the account holders did so because they were ' under pressure from the tax authorities '			0
@entity157 will air on @entity344 tonight and has seen thousands of leaked accounts showing how bankers helped clients – nearly 7,000 of them @entity8 – to avoid taxes			0
some account details were stolen by a computer hacker in 2007 and were presented to @entity50 in 2010			1
@entity157 spoke to a whistleblower who said @entity7 had still failed to implement changes when she worked there in 2013			0
@entity353 , who was the private bank 's head of compliance in @entity357 , said : ' the verbal messages were great but they were n't put into practice			0
' she was sacked after raising concerns and an unfair dismissal tribunal ruled in her favour .			0
