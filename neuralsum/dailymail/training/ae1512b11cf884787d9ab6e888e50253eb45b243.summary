at the end of a low scoring week at the picturesque @entity2 , @entity0 was left holding the trophy aloft as winner of the @entity5 presented by @entity6			1
seven birdies and just a single dropped shot added up to a round of 65 on sunday as the @entity10 posted a 19 under par total to win by a stroke from playing partner @entity13 , with @entity15 ’s @entity14 a shot further back in third position			1
this latest success for @entity0 , who won his first professional title earlier this year on the @entity20 , means the 22 - year - old will now have a full category on the @entity23 for the rest of the year			1
it will allow the @entity10 to plan a proper schedule , and it also sees him jump to fifth on the @entity28 , with the top 15 earning their place on @entity31 come the end of the season			1
all smiles : @entity0 holds his prize aloft after sealing victory in the @entity5 having just received the trophy , and a rather large cheque for € 25,600 at the presentation on the 18th green , @entity0 was clearly over the moon with his success			1
' this is pretty cool , ' said the @entity10 , who represents @entity45 , part of @entity48 network			1
' my first round was n’t that great , but since then i have played some really good golf , and for it to turn into a victory this week , well , i ca n’t put it into words			1
it is my first victory , which makes it special , because i have been playing on invites up until now and this just changes my whole schedule , my season , and my goals			2
' it ’s easy to say now that i saw it coming , but i felt like i was playing well again , and have been hitting the ball like i wanted to			2
to win takes so much more than just playing well though , as there are so many good guys out here , so you could say i got lucky in the end , as i holed a great putt on 15 to win by one			2
i ’m just overwhelmed and happy , and ca n’t wait to go to @entity70 next week			2
' i knew that 19 or 20 under was going to be needed to win , and luckily i got off to a great start as i was five under through nine			2
then i just kept on going , stayed aggressive , and knowing i was close to the lead helped as i knew i could n’t get defensive			0

” ' i ’ve got a six hour drive now until i get back , and i do n’t think my girlfriend knows that i won yet , but i ’m sure there will be some celebrations tomorrow			0
on tuesday i go to @entity70 , so tomorrow will be the day to celebrate			0
i do n’t know what it will be , but i ’m sure my family and my girlfriend will figure something out			0
' coming up just short of @entity0 ’s winning total was @entity175 ’s @entity13 , who birdied his final three holes on sunday to match his best ever finish on the @entity23 , which came at the @entity177 hosted by @entity178 last june			1
while some players might be disappointed to come up just shy of a maiden title , the 22 year old @entity180 resident was excited to continue a run of consistent form			1
' i played alright today , ' said @entity13			0
' five under is always a decent score , @entity185 just played great today			0
i tried my best , and i ’m quite happy with my finish , especially making those birdies in the last few holes			0
' i ’m getting closer to winning , i ’ve still got plenty of golf ahead of me , and i think it ’s coming			0
it is better to play more consistent in my opinion , rather than win and then not play well			0
i ’d rather do that , play well every week , still trying to win			0
i am very happy with a second place finish			0
' on his own in third place was @entity14 , who fired a four under par 67 on sunday to continue a fine run of form in this event , having finished second 12 months ago			0
the @entity15 finished a stroke clear of overnight leader @entity205 , who posted his best result of a maiden @entity23 campaign by finishing in a tie for fourth , thanks to a sunday 69 in @entity211			1
alongside him were @entity213 ( 66 ) , who won the opening event of the season at the @entity216 in march , as well as @entity10 ’s @entity217 ( 68 ) , who had lead in the early stages of the final round			1
a shot further back were @entity84 ’s @entity222 , who shot a 64 in the final round to move into a tie for seventh with the @entity86 pair of @entity226 ( 65 ) and @entity227 ( 69 ) , as well as @entity229 @entity228 ( 67 ) .			1
