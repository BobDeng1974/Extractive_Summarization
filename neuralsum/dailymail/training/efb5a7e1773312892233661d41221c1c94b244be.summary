if i keep the suit and leave it in my @entity79 ’s wardrobe never to be worn then that is okay , but if i sell it on to a buyer who really wants it that is n’t ? ' he added : ‘ where is the logic behind that ? it ’s rich of anyone to knock someone else ’s charitable donations			0

‘ it does n’t fit my dad , so we want to sell it to someone who can get value out of it as that ’s better than it being unused			0
mr @entity4 queued for one and a half hours before he bought the suit from the @entity18 @entity17 charity shop in @entity19 ‘ this way i can raise more money for charity than i already have by buying the tux and make a profit to do something nice with my dad			1
