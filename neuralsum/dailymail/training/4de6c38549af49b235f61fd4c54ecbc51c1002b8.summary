by @entity0 published : 22:27 est , 7 september 2012 updated : 22:59 est , 7 september 2012 not guilty : a judge has ruled that former california governor @entity2 did not break any laws when he reduced a manslaughter sentence for a political ally 's son a @entity8 superior court judge ruled friday that former gov. @entity2 did n't break any laws when he cut the manslaughter sentence for the son of a political ally just hours before leaving office last year			1
judge @entity13 called @entity2 's decision to reduce @entity16 's sentence from 16 years to seven years distasteful and ' repugnant to the bulk of the citizenry of this state , ' but within his executive powers as governor			1
@entity16 is the son of the governor 's onetime political ally , former assembly speaker @entity22			1
@entity16 pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter in a 2008 attack on an unarmed group of young men after he and some friends were turned away from a fraternity party in @entity30			2
three others pleaded guilty to various charges in the attack that killed 22 - year - old college student @entity34			0
@entity34 ' family and the @entity30 district attorney sued , claiming that @entity2 violated the voter - approved @entity37 , which requires families be notified about cases involving their loved ones			2
' the attorney general 's office fought for corruption , and they won , ' said @entity43 , @entity34 ' mother , outside court			2
disappointment : @entity43 and @entity45 , the victim 's parents , expressed their upset after the ruling on friday describing @entity2 and @entity16 as conniving politicians ' they defended a backroom deal , you know ? they got away with it for today , but we 're very disappointed			1
where 's the justice for our son ? he was murdered			2
two conniving politicians got away with it			0
' the family said the judge 's words were not enough			0
they want the reduced sentence for @entity16 thrown out			1
@entity13 sided with the attorney general 's office in ruling that @entity37 does not specifically address the governor 's power of pardons and commutations , which may have been an oversight when it was drafted			2
he said that other laws cited by the plaintiffs ' attorneys also did not place a specific obligation on the governor to notify the family or the district attorney , even if that had been the practice in @entity2 's office for other pardon and commutation applications			1
political pop : former assembly speaker @entity22 's son was one of several men convicted in the 2008 slaying of an unarmed 22 - year - old college student ' based on the evidentiary records before this court involving this case , there was an abuse of discretion , ' @entity13 said			1
' this was a distasteful commutation			0
it was repugnant to the bulk of the citizenry of this state			0
... it is outside the normal realm , the normal circle of fundamental justice			0
' but , he said , it was not illegal			0
@entity30 district attorney @entity105 said her office will appeal the judge 's decision			2
the @entity34 family said they were considering their options			0
@entity2 said in his commutation notice that he believed the sentence was excessive given @entity16 's ' limited role in the killing			1
' he said evidence showed that @entity16 's friend delivered the fatal blow , yet both men received the same 16 - year - sentence			1
the former governor told @entity122 in april 2011 that his office made a mistake in not notifying @entity34 ' parents , but he defended the decision , saying : ' i mean , of course you help a friend			1
' @entity105 and attorneys for the @entity34 family said @entity2 blatantly violated the state constitution with his last - minute decision , ignored the victims ' due process rights and acted ' in an arbitrary and capricious manner			0
' low places : in an interview in 2011 @entity2 , pictured before a cartoon character of himself , expressed no doubt in helping out a friend there was evidence that @entity2 generally required that his office follow the provisions of @entity37 , which voters approved while he was in office in 2008 , when he considered other clemency cases , deputy district attorney @entity141 wrote in a brief filed this week			1
' @entity2 knew the law , he knew exactly what was required of him , and yet he defied the oath of his office , ' @entity141 wrote			2
@entity16 , now 23 , is incarcerated at @entity152 in @entity153 , about 50 miles southeast of @entity8 , and is scheduled for release in 2017			0
his father is a political consultant in @entity8			0
gov. @entity156 in october signed a bill that was written in response to the controversy over @entity16 's commutation			1
it requires the governor to give at least 10 days ' notice to the district attorney in the jurisdiction where the crime occurred before acting on an application for clemency			0
that would give the district attorney time to notify crime victims and allow them to petition against a sentence reduction .			0

as one of his last moves in office the former @entity175 governor cut @entity16 's sentence from 16 years to seven
@entity16 is the son of former assembly speaker @entity22
in a 2011 interview @entity2 said : ' i mean , of course you help a friend . '
