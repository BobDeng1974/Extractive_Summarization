@entity0 does not have a death wish , but she wants to be the one calling the shots when it comes to the time and manner of her passing - not her terminal cancer			1
at age 29 , @entity9 was filled with bright hopes for the future : starting a family with her newlywed husband , traveling and going on mountain - climbing adventures with her friends			2
but on january 1 , 2014 , everything changed : doctors determined that the source of her persistent headaches was an aggressive malignant tumor in her brain			0
@entity9 , a vivacious young woman described by her mother as precocious and larger than life , decided then and there to take her life , or whatever was left of it , into her own hands			2
on monday , mrs @entity0 launched an online video campaign for @entity51 , an end - of - life non-profit organization , to promote death - with - dignity laws , which currently exist in only five states			1
in order to have the option of ending her life on her own terms , @entity9 , her husband , @entity27 , and her parents moved from @entity60 to @entity61 , @entity62 , which has a death - with - dignity legislation on the books			1
on november 1 , @entity9 plans to take a pill given to her by her doctors and painlessly fade away surrounded by her loved ones in her and @entity27 's bedroom , with her favorite music playing in the background			1

’ the 29 - year - old @entity61 resident said she decided on this course of action after hearing from her doctors what would happen to her body in the final stages of her illness			0

since @entity62 lawmakers passed the death with @entity126 in 1997 , more than 1,170 people have obtained prescriptions under the law , and fewer than half of them used them to end their lives			2

working through her foundation , the @entity158 , @entity9 wants other states , like @entity160 , @entity161 and @entity162 , to consider passing laws that would allow people to make the ultimate choice - life or death			1
despite increasing pain , seizures and growing weakness , @entity9 has remained active , traveling around the country with her family and best friend to try and visit as many places on her bucket list as possible before november 1 - the day after her husband ’s birthday			1
so far , @entity0 has journeyed to @entity141 and took a trip to @entity140 with husband @entity27 , but she still hopes to see the @entity178 before the end			1

with less than one month to go before the date chosen by @entity9 as her final day on earth , the young woman reminds everyone what is truly important in life			2
‘ seize the day , what 's important to you , what you care about , what matters , ’ she says			0
‘ pursue that - forget the rest			0
