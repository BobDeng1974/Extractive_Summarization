by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 is the greatest player in the world , perhaps of all time , and after a few minor adjustments @entity5 will be on their way to winning the @entity9			1
that is how life looks inside the self - deceptive bubble which this @entity2 band of brothers inhabit			1
@entity14 tells it thus : ‘ @entity16 does or does n’t do in this @entity9 he is the greatest player in the world and one of the greatest in the history of football			1
’ @entity21 : @entity2 moment of genius : @entity2 scores a superb goal to put @entity5 2 - 1 up against @entity25 and ( below ) @entity27 's graphic of the strike how @entity2 lit up @entity29 : @entity2 's goal against @entity25 rare moment of quality : @entity2 celebrates his goal but before that he had an absolute nightmare but then @entity36 is the manager of @entity5			1
and without a @entity2 brimming with confidence his team would have no better than an outside chance of reaching the final on july 13			2
@entity2 the greatest player on the planet today ? well , you could say he was for the duration of the 10 seconds it took him to collect the ball , dance past an assortment of @entity25 defenders and fire his exceptional goal in off a post			1
but for the 64 minutes which preceded that magical moment he had an absolute nightmare of a first game at @entity55 2014 , running into opponents , losing the ball and looking up at the heavens as if trying to remind the almighty of his divine rights			1
true enough @entity2 did play better after scoring but in objective realty not like one of the gods of the game			2
the comparisons with his forefather @entity65 keep on coming but on this display they are an insult to the @entity68 who once claimed that the @entity70 helped him beat @entity71 in one @entity9 quarter - final			2
great belief : @entity5 's coach @entity14 ( left ) thinks @entity2 is one of the best players of all time @entity77 , @entity78 and @entity79 are among others entitled to feel slighted			1
this is not to deny that @entity2 is a terrific player and has the rare skills and intelligence to rise to the pantheon			1
but , as with any player blessed by birth to play for one of the major football powers , he needs his big @entity9 to be anointed			1
whether that will happen here remains as up in the air as the @entity93 players when they were launched skywards by the hackers from @entity96			0
virtually all he did on sunday night was emphasise how capable he is of scoring amazing goals			0
but in so doing he also reminded us that this is only his second in a @entity9			2
he is in his prime right now and if he does not conquer @entity55 - outshining the likes of @entity103 , @entity104 , @entity105 and @entity106 in the process – then the clock will be ticking all the louder			0
@entity65 and @entity2 's goalscoring records for @entity5 @entity65 91 games , 34 goals ( 1977 - 94 ) @entity2 87 games , 39 goals ( 2005 - ) @entity2 will turn 27 the day before @entity5 play @entity113 in their last group game			2
given that they are in an apparently less demanding section , he and his team - mates will presumably be in the mood to celebrate after that match			0
how far they progress beyond that will depend not only on @entity14 sorting out his tactics but whether they can bring their collective ego down to earth			0
they should have been punished by the @entity25 in a ragged , disorganised first half , although they did improve when @entity14 sent on a couple of decent substitutes and reverted to an orthodox back four			0
yet even in the closing stages , after @entity2 had put them two up , that old arrogance returned and they conceded one goal and almost threw the win away			0
insult : there is still no comparison between @entity2 and @entity9 winner @entity65 @entity68 @entity137 : @entity65 , deified in his homeland , scores that controversial goal against @entity71 in 1986 @entity14 admitted only : ‘ maybe we made one or two errors and i got one or two things wrong			1
but we will get better			0
’ complacency is contagious in this camp but at least @entity2 did not appear too gravely affected when he observed : ‘ yes , we do have to improve			0
’ he can say that again			0
and he had better keep doing so if the tens of thousands of @entity68 – some of whom managed to break into the @entity29 without tickets on sunday – are not to be disappointed .			0

@entity2 had a nightmare for 64 minutes against @entity25
he is a terrific player but needs a big @entity9 to prove himself
@entity77 , @entity78 and @entity79 should be slighted by comparison
