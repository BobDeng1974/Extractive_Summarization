@entity1 took @entity10 to a tribunal after they refused to pay him a redundancy settlement after reading about his sentence for child pornography in the local paper			1
the former power station worker was being made redundant following the closure of a plant in @entity19 , @entity20 , when he admitted making indecent images of children			1
after reading of his sentence his employers suspended his holiday pay and cancelled a redundancy package , arguing he had ' frustrated ' his contract by not being available to work			1
however , @entity31 , from the @entity30 , successfully argued that as @entity1 was on agreed leave at the time and was not expected back at work before his job came to an end , he was not in breach of his contract			2
he also said that @entity1 had no moral or legal duty to tell his employers of the criminal case because it did not involve them			2
in february @entity1 was sentenced to two years behind bars after admitting 10 charges , including making indecent images , intentionally encouraging or assisting the commission of an offence and distributing indecent photos			2
employment judge @entity48 said : ' in this case it is said on the behalf of the claimant that the contract is not frustrated by his imprisonment because there was no requirement for the claimant to be at work			0
' he was on leave			0
whether the claimant was in @entity62 ( @entity63 ) or in @entity64 , it made no difference to the contract of employment			0
' @entity1 was being made redundant from @entity68 when he admitted the offences causing @entity10 to cancel his payments because he had ' frustrated ' his contract by not being available to work he said @entity10 had cancelled the payment as @entity1 was not available to work while he was in prison			1
however , the judge told the tribunal parties : ' my conclusion is that the contract was not frustrated			0
imprisonment does not automatically end the employment			0
' in this case the claimant was not expected to enter work , whether in prison or out , before the contract of employment expired			0
' the claimant 's imprisonment has not made any contractual obligation incapable of being performed - he was not required to work			0
' in his judgement , mr @entity48 said he was awarding @entity1 £ 5,850 in statutory redundancy , £ 24,953 for breach of contract and £ 1,731 in holiday pay .			1
