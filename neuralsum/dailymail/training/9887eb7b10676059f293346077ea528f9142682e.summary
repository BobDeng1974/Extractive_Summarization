' @entity9 was filmed taking part in a fight with an eight - year - old boy whose father has requested he remain anonymous , kicking , shoving and grappling in front of baying adults at a social club in @entity17			1
his opponent , who has not been named , was left in tears , and the video footage has sparked outrage among child and medical experts , who called for a police and social services investigation			1
@entity9 likes cage fighting because he loves the ' crowd cheering really loud ' however , @entity9 hit back last night , telling the @entity34 : ' i like the atmosphere when fighting			2
the crowd cheering is really loud			2
' it is good fun			2
i enjoy it and i am quite good at it			0
i am more confident when i 'm wrestling			0
' meanwhile , his father @entity43 , 33 , a breakdown recovery driver , claimed the discipline of the sport helped his son , who used to be naughty , learn respect			1
he said there was no harm in the sport adding : ' if he was n't cage fighting he would probably be chucking stones at buses and giving people grief			1
' last night , legal experts warned parents who encourage their young children to take part in cage fighting contests could be jailed for child cruelty			1

brutal : the boys are not wearing padding or head gear as they grapple and slam each other into the canvas upsetting : the young boy seen here is crying in the middle of a fight , and is then attended by medical experts who check if he can carry on with the bout in a @entity17 working club battle : @entity28 , nine , with an eight - year - old whose father has asked for his face to be obscured a source at the @entity91 said : ‘ a young child being forced to take part in any violent sport could constitute child cruelty			1
as such , a failure to protect that child from harm could lead to a minimum 12 - week sentence or a maximum 26 - week sentence			1
’ social services bosses in @entity73 confirmed they had launched an inquiry into the cage fighting , which is also known as mixed martial arts , to ‘ consider any child safety concerns ’			1
parental support : @entity9 with his father @entity43 , the youngster features in the shocking video which shows hundreds of baying adults goading the primary - age boys to fight each other culture secretary @entity113 yesterday condemned the fighting among children as young as eight as ‘ barbaric ’			1
‘ getting more young people doing sport is great but i do ask myself whether it really does have to be in a cage , ’ he said			0
‘ it feels very barbaric and i know there are concerns about children that young doing a sport like that			1
’ he added he was ‘ shocked and surprised ’ by claims there were no restrictions on children appearing in such adult environments			1
his comments came after the @entity135 , the @entity132 and @entity133 branded child cage fighting ‘ disturbing and sick ’			2
a @entity137 of @entity139 spokesman insisted : ‘ children this young should n’t be involved in cage fighting			2

professional appearance : just like in an adult event , the tiny fighters have an entourage			0
seconds out : the boys are brought together in the middle of the cage fighting ring , prepared to do battle grappling : the pair begin their fight slowly , testing out the space between them as they start their bout it emerged last night , however , that council chiefs have ordered a licence review for the @entity165 and will ask the venue not to put on any similar events involving juveniles			1
@entity169 : ' this was about giving grown - ups , swigging lager , an evening of blood - thirsty excitement , to match that of adult cage fighting			0
in @entity177 , we have long had laws which ban dog fighting			2
rightly , it is believed that inciting animals to hurt each other for the entertainment of their human masters is barbaric			0
which rather begs the question : in what sort of country do the police pursue with the full force of the law those who encourage dogs to fight one another , but turn a blind eye when adults do the same with children ? ' read more here the deputy leader of @entity200 , @entity201 , said : ‘ i am appalled by the incident of cage fighting involving children taking place in @entity17			1
‘ having checked the club ’s licence there is a condition that children should not be on the premises at public events after 6pm and i think it needs to be looked into whether this condition has been breached			1
‘ as such , i have now made a request for the licence at @entity165 to be reviewed			0
a formal licensing review process will now follow			0
’ that could take up to three months as the club is allowed 28 days to make representations on the matter			2
a similar period is then opened up for members of the public to have their say			0
the shocking video that emerged on wednesday shows @entity9 and the unnamed boy fighting without protective padding or head gear			1
