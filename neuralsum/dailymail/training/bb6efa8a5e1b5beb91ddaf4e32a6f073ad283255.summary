with the snow thick on the ground in the snow - covered forests outside the east @entity6 city of @entity7 , food is in short supply			2
which is perhaps why these two squirrels have such a dramatic reaction as they skirmish over a cone - and the precious seeds it contains			1
the amazing images , captured by photographer @entity15 , appear to show one squirrel flying through the air to catch the cone after its companion throws it - but the truth is rather less friendly			1
@entity15 , 30 , recalls the first squirrel setting its sights on a pine cone that he had placed in a clearing before it began to extract the seeds inside			1
soon a jealous fellow squirrel arrived in a bid to get a taste of the fallen food			0
the duo lunge at each other and at times soar through the air as they battle for dominance			2
