but , within 24 hours , @entity4 has ventured out into the capital with her baby daughter @entity6 pushing a second pram , a @entity8 , £ 819 , in as many days			1

wearing a pair of leggings and a blue fleeced top , the new mother looked healthy and happy as she walked through @entity20			0
matching her look with a pair of blue and white trainers , she has clearly snapped back into shape after giving birth less than one month ago			0
but onlookers will question @entity4 's need for a secondary pram given how indulgent her other one iswith @entity46 crystals			1
the daughter of @entity48 displayed a more modest baby stroller when she was spotted out on friday mother 's nature : the brunette beauty has clearly taken to motherhood well while it is not clear just how much pram 's customisation cost , just the @entity31 - the iconic @entity57 pram - itself costs a staggering £ 1,450			1
and while there are several companies in the @entity62 who offer the customisation , it would n't have come cheaply for the heiress to get the pram changed to her liking			2
however , @entity4 did n't actually pay for her pram herself as it was a gift - from her sister @entity70			1
only the best ! @entity4 and @entity22 stepped out with daughter @entity6 in a customised , crystal - encrusted pink @entity31 pram in @entity2 on wednesday doting : @entity4 and @entity22 looked like the picture of parental bliss as they strolled along with @entity6 in the sunshine personalised : the pram also had the name ' @entity6 ' in a name plate on the front - in case there is any doubt over who it belongs to bling : the pram itself , the @entity57 , costs £ 1,450 - while the customisation would have been more - including the baby 's ' @entity88 would have been more fit for an @entity4 princess : @entity6 is riding in style in her blingtastic baby carriage the @entity57 pram has been popular among celebrities for years , with stars including @entity96 splashing out on the designs for their children			1
it not only looks good but boasts a hand - sprung chassis , is cushioned with leather suspension straps and features handspoked wheels			0
the transport also includes a lever operated brake system , a soft foam mattress for maximum comfort and an extremely large chrome shopping basket			0
while the pink hood and apron come as standard on the pram , it is the crystallised pink and silver detailing on the body of the pram that @entity4 would have had to pay extra for			1
the pram also features a silver nameplate which read ' @entity6 ' on the front - just in case there is any doubt as to who is belongs to			2
despite only giving birth to @entity6 on 17th march , @entity4 already appeared to have snapped back into shape			1
are you ok in there ? @entity4 and @entity22 could n't help but coo over their little charge mid-stroll in 1877 , inventor @entity130 created @entity31 because of a lack of suitable buggies for his own children			1
he opened a small workshop in @entity135 , @entity136 , where he grew the business with the help of his three sons			0
in 1913 , it became the official royal pram , and a special edition was created and sent to @entity143 for princess @entity144 , who is now @entity144			2

the 29 - year - old socialite showed off her post-baby body in a striped black and grey jumper with a pair of three - quarter length black leggings and pink @entity164 trainers for the outing on tuesday			0
with her make - up and hair completely flawless , it 's hard to believe that @entity4 is a first time mother			1
speaking to @entity170 recently about parenthood , @entity4 said : ' motherhood is the best thing that 's ever happened to me , and i 'm enjoying every minute of it			1
' i knew i would love it - i just did n't know how much			0
i feel born to be a mother			0
' although i 've always wanted children , i 've never felt that intensely before			0
but @entity6 has turned my world upside down in an amazing way and i 've never been happier			0
' having my own family with @entity22 is just perfect			0
' how did she do that ? @entity4 already appears to have snapped back into shape , less than three weeks after the birth of her daughter proud family : @entity4 looked flawless in @entity6 's first picture just minutes after her daughter 's birth @entity22 looked equally relaxed for the jaunt , keeping a protective arm around his wife 's waist as they walked along			2
