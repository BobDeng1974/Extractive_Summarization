by @entity0 published : 18:58 est , 26 november 2012 updated : 11:58 est , 27 november 2012 @entity1 has sparked hysteria among its users by proposing to remove their right to vote on changes to the rules which govern the site			1
the end to the site 's experiment in democracy marks an attempt to gain more control over its own future as it tries to build a robust business model for the future			0
but many users have reacted with fury , and attempted to protect themselves against changes to @entity1 's privacy policy by posting a lengthy - but useless - legal disclaimer on their own profile pages			2
users hoping to stop the firm exploiting their data to make money will be disappointed to learn that updating their @entity1 status provides no legal protection whatsoever			1
rule change : @entity1 will no longer allow users to vote on its policies outrage : the backlash to the firm 's decision is another headache for founder and ceo @entity37 should @entity1 end their democratic system which lets users vote on changes to site rules ? since 2009 , the web giant has held a vote on any changes to its privacy policies which attract at least 7,000 comments			1
the referendum then overrides the new policy as long as 30 per cent of @entity1 's active users - around 300million people - participate in the vote			2
but now the company is stepping back from the innovative reform , which was intended to mark it out as a community governed by its users rather than a typical firm focussed only on the bottom line			0
@entity1 issued a statement claiming the voting mechanism ' resulted in a system that incentivized the quantity of comments over their quality '			0
the site promised to replace the system with a new process offering ' more meaningful feedback and engagement ' - but did not elaborate on how they would continue to take the view of users into account			0
announcement : @entity1 has revealed it is revoking users ' right to vote on its privacy policy useless : many users have posted notices like this one on their own profile , but they provide no protection however , @entity1 account - holders hoping to retain their democratic rights have one last chance to stop the change - as nearly 20,000 people have already registered their opposition to the new policy , the site is likely to hold a vote this week or next or whether the change will go through			1
it will be the third time in the site 's history that it has allowed its users to vote on a policy change			0
the firm insists that even if the right to vote on changes is repealed , it will still consult users on its privacy policies and seek their approval before sharing more of their information with advertisers			2
but @entity1 's assurances are apparently not enough for thousands of its users , who have lashed out at the site			2
disaster : the social network has seen its share price slump since its ipo in may in an attempt to prevent the site from using their data for commercial purposes , many have posted statements such as : ' in response to the new @entity1 guidelines i hereby declare that my copyright is attached to all of my personal details , illustrations , paintings , writing , publications , photos and videos , etc. ( as a results of the @entity135			1
) ' for commercial use of the above my written consent is needed at all times			0
( anyone reading this can copy this text and paste it on their @entity143			0
this will place them under protection of copyright laws			0
) ' unfortunately for worried @entity1 users , posting that comment has no legal force , and does not overrule the terms of service to which people agree when they start using the site			1
the mention of the ' @entity135 ' is particularly unhelpful , as there is no such thing - it appears to be an erroneous reference to the @entity161 which governs the validity of copyright law across national borders			0
ultimately , the only way to stop @entity1 exploiting your information for commercial gain is to delete all your posts and shut down your account			1
this latest pr disaster caps off a dismal year for the social network , which launched a much - hyped $ 100billion ipo in may but has seen its share price slump by a third since then amidst fears it will be unable to convert its runaway popularity into lasting profit .			1

site announces it will end three - year experiment in democratic voting
users hit out at social network and post ' legal *messages* ' *banning* @entity1 from sharing their information with others
but posts have no legal force and can not stop firm exploiting user data
