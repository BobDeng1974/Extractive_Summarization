@entity0 unveiled a host of new features in its @entity4 software this week , but neglected to mention one that will leave its users rejoicing - improved battery life			1
a presentation slide shown during the tech giant ’s @entity9 revealed the next - generation software will monitor battery usage by app. the software will be widely available in the autumn , at the same time the @entity16 is expected to launch , meaning the much - rumoured handset could finally end @entity0 ’s battery woes			1
which ? magazine then compared the battery life of eight high - end smartphones including models by @entity38 , @entity0 , @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41			1
@entity38 's @entity42 came top for calls and browsing time , while @entity0 's @entity32 and 5c placed in 4th and 7th place respectively			2
by monitoring which apps use the most power , @entity0 users will be able to keep a closer eye on their battery life and know which services to close , in order to extend it			2
@entity55 has had a similar feature for years			0
leaked images and reports about @entity0 ’s next flagship phone - dubbed @entity16 - have been circulating since last year			0
if the rumours turn out to be true , the @entity16 will have a rounded , thinner design and a larger screen - with some claiming it could jump from the current 4 - inch , up to 5.5 - inch			0
it could also feature a protruding camera , and boast new filters , to create better photos			0
in march , @entity0 was awarded a patent for a power - saving mode			1

the @entity74 launched with an improved power - saving mode ( pictured ) - proving how important battery life is to users @entity0 was recently awarded a patent for a power - saving mode			1
the files ( pictured ) detail a system that tracks how a person users their phone , and makes power - saving changes accordingly			1
built - in sensors detect changes in light and environment , meaning the device could close apps or alter screen brightness the application details a system that tracks how a person users their phone using a variety of sensors , and then makes tailored power - saving changes accordingly			1
for example , the patent explained that if the system detects a ' relatively dark environment ' - such as when a user plays a video game - it may dim the backlight of the display automatically			0
it could also decrease the amount of power being used by the central processing unit ( @entity109 ) , while increasing the amount of energy needed to power the graphical processing unit ( @entity113 ) specifically needed for the game			0
developers who have been given early access to the @entity4 software have confirmed the battery usage by apps feature , and it could take advantage of some of the technologies detailed in this patent			1
leaked images ( pictured ) and reports about @entity0 's next flagship phone - dubbed @entity16 - have been circulating since last year			0
if the rumours turn out to be true , the @entity16 will have a rounded , thinner design and a larger screen these images were posted on @entity131 social network @entity129 last month and are thought to have been leaked by an anonymous insider working at @entity0 supplier @entity133			0
although the images are blurry , they appear to show a rounded design and protruding camera , similar to that seen on the @entity138 despite claiming its @entity29 software would boost energy efficiency , a ‘ manufacturing defect ’ in october caused problems on the @entity32			0
