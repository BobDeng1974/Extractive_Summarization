he looks like your average adventurous toddler with his huge grin and playful antics , but on the inside @entity5 is battling a rare and inoperable brain tumour			1
in his short life , the two - year - old from @entity9 in @entity10 has already undergone two brain surgeries , fallen ill to meningitis , suffered multiple seizures and had eight mris			1
now , his parents @entity16 and @entity18 have been hit with the heartbreaking news the tumour has started to grow			1
two - year - old @entity5 from @entity9 in @entity10 is undergoing surgery for third time this week in a bid to get a biopsy for his inoperable brain tumour @entity5 's parents @entity16 and @entity18 were recently told their only son 's tumour had started to grow after he was first diagnosed 11 months ago @entity5 was first diagnosed with the inoperable tumour 11 months ago			1
there 's no way for doctors to know exactly what type of tumour he has and whether it is malignant unless they carry out a biopsy			1
' he 's had surgery twice to try and get a biopsy			1
they go in through the top of his head but they ca n't see the tumour so that ca n't do it			2
they can only do it if they go behind his head , ' ms @entity16 told @entity49			2
' if they go through there , there 's a very high risk he 'll lose his sight and any movement because it is growing at the top of his spinal cord			0
there 's no way for doctors to know exactly what type of tumour @entity5 has and whether it is malignant unless they carry out a biopsy @entity5 has already had two surgeries to try and get a biopsy but doctors have n't been able to see the tumour			1
they can go through the back of his head but there 's a high chance he 'll lose his sight and movement as the tumour is growing at the top of his spine ' my son is on the go , he 's always outside			2
we ca n't take that away from him – it 's a very hard and difficult decision for us			2
' @entity5 is having his third surgery to try and get a biopsy this week			1
' they 've always said they wo n't do chemotherapy until they detect growth			1
unfortunately they need to treat it and they 've told us it needs to be treated straight away , ' ms @entity16 said			2
' to treat him with the right chemotherapy , they need to do a biopsy to work out what kind of tumour they 're dealing with and that just ca n't be an option			1
' @entity5 , pictured here with his dad @entity102 getting antibiotics in june after catching two brain infections , has been back and forth between @entity105 and his home in rural @entity10 for the past 11 months @entity5 's mum @entity16 said he had been through more than most adults over the past year and had shown remarkable courage despite the trauma of the past 11 months , ms @entity16 said @entity5 had shown remarkable courage			1
' he 's been through a lot more than many adults would have and he 's been so brave , ' she said			0
' @entity5 is my hero , he 's so strong			2
' as soon as he wakes up from surgery and the morphine wears off , he 's running around and smiling			2
you would know there 's something that big in his head			0
' the young family have been back and forth between their home in @entity9 , in central @entity10 , and @entity122 since october			2
' even though he 's young , he 's not stupid			0
when we 're in the elevators at the hospital and we stop on level two he reacts and does n't want to get out			0
he knows that 's the level surgery is done on , ' ms @entity16 said			1
' when he does his mris he will just cry lying on his back			0
he knows what 's going to happen			0
it 's cruel but he takes it			0
i just have to tell him it 's okay and i love him			0
' he 's our first child so the whole time i try not to think of the negatives			0
' his parents first realised something was wrong when he started walking in to walls and falling over in october 2013			0
three weeks later , @entity5 stopped walking altogether @entity16 and @entity102 had built a brand new home in @entity9 just before @entity5 was born			1
@entity16 said if they had to sell the house they would to pay for the ongoing medical costs @entity5 's parents first realised something was wrong when he started walking in to walls and falling over - three weeks later he stopped walking altogether			1
' the first doctor we went to said it was an ear infection because that can make you wobbly , ' ms @entity16 said			0
' after he stopped walking we went to the best gp in town and he said we needed to get an mri immediately			0
we went straight to @entity122 where they told us he had a tumour			0
' we were transfered @entity105 and they did surgery the next day - it all started back then and has n't stopped			1
' the constant time away from home is starting to take its toll financially on the family			0
' we built a brand new home just before @entity5 was born			0
it 's our home but if we have to sell it we will , ' ms @entity16 said			2
' it would just be a lot easier if we knew what it was , but we do n’t			0
i hope there ’s someone or something out there that can cure @entity5			0
' the @entity181 has been set up to raise money for the two - year - old 's treatment			1

@entity5 was diagnosed with a brain tumour back in october
the two - year - old is having his third brain surgery this week so doctors can try and get a biopsy
his parents @entity16 and @entity18 were told a few weeks ago @entity5 's tumour had grown and treatment was urgent
doctors wo n't start chemotherapy until they know what type of tumour it is , which is n't possible without a biopsy
