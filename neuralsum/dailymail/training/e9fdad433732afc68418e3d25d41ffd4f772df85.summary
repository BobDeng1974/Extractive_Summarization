@entity0 appears to have copied the opening credits of hit tv show homeland to introduce the beheading of @entity5 journalist @entity4			1
@entity2 opens with rough cuts between poor quality footage of news reports , @entity9 , and a speech by @entity11 declaring : ' we must and we will remain vigilant at home and abroad '			2
almost identical , the prelude to the brutal @entity16 video shows @entity11 's reaction to the murder of @entity5 journalist @entity19 , in which he states : ' we will be vigilant and we will be relentless '			2
experts have branded the technique a clear move by the extremist group to lure @entity28 recruits using themes from popular culture that romanticise warfare and terrorism			1
dr @entity33 , of the @entity34 at @entity35 , told @entity36 the videos are a ' means of psychological warfare ' that offer young @entity41 ' the illusion to escape the rigid world of boredom '			2
copy ? the homeland opening credits ( left ) uses poor - quality footage of @entity11 declaring ' we will remain vigiltant '			0
the @entity0 video released yesterday ( right ) does the same with @entity11 saying : ' we will be vigilant ' ' they know that these demonstrations of power when wrapped nicely can attract young @entity41 and particularly young converts to @entity55 to join their ranks , ' he said			1
' to a degree they offer youngster the illusion to escape the rigid world of boredom they live in in the @entity63			0
@entity64 provides a cause to fight for and a platform to become something you are not			0
' both @entity2 and the latest @entity0 video - entitled a second message to @entity5 - have deliberately shaky camera shots and special effects to interfere with the colour balance and sound quality of the video			1
they both fade in and out from president @entity11 with @entity77 subtitles on the screen			0
in the latest video broadcasting the murder of @entity5 journalist @entity4 , @entity0 uses a few seconds of president @entity11 speaking in a similar manner to the opening scenes of the hit tv series which is shown on @entity84			1
in the terrorist video , the producer uses commercially available video editing technology to mimic the the techniques used in @entity89			1
according to one video expert who spoke with @entity36 , both clips are in black and white so the colour saturation had been dropped			0
' the image in @entity2 flips over – the visuals in this use a scroll effect			2
' in @entity2 the title sequence is a stream of consciousness you see @entity100 waking and sleeping			0
they have put a filter on the footage so it appears that it is someone else watching this			0
the president is shown giving a speech addressing the threat posed by the fictional terrorists his speech is cut into a @entity112 news broadcast with arabic script at the bottom of the screen one @entity117 user believes that those behind the @entity0 broadcasts are from the west ' in homeland they use @entity77 subtitles at the bottom of the screen faded into a news report			1
in the @entity0 video the @entity77 subtitles are also at the bottom of the screen beneath president @entity11			1
' @entity0 has also put a crackle on the audio of president @entity11 's speech to make it sound more " edgy "			1
' in the @entity2 excerpt president @entity11 is reported as saying ' we must and will ' remain vigilant at home and abroad			0
in the @entity0 version he says we " will continue to do what we must do to protect our people , we will be vigilant and we will be relentless "			1
' many of the videos are produced by the @entity139 , which is the terrorist organisation 's communications department			2
according to dr @entity33 : ' they are trying to appeal to new recruits in the @entity63			0
they are staging these beheadings in a particular way by using themes from popular culture – the series @entity2 might come to mind			2
' sickening : mr @entity11 vowed that ' justice will be served ' after @entity4 ( pictured ) was killed on video threatened : this image is believed to show @entity0 militant @entity154 and the @entity156 hostage he has threatened to murder next			1
the video was released two weeks to the day another video showing the execution of @entity5 journalist @entity19 was released online dr @entity33 said one of the benefits for @entity0 in showing these executions is that it has a psychological impact on their opponents			1
the extremist group now presides over a mass of land equivalent to the size of the @entity156 , from @entity171 to central @entity172 , and controls at least four million people			0
he said : ' the fact that @entity178 units abandoned their posts in @entity180 in june shows that is succeeded in spreading fear			1
they have built a reputation of being ruthless			0
in this respect these videos are a means of psychological warfare			2
' third , these videos are a direct means of communication with the @entity63			2
they want to outrage @entity28 publics and governments to lure them into taking a more active role in @entity172 and @entity196			0
it is a bait that the @entity63 should refrain from taking			0
' another murder : it comes just two weeks after another video showing the beheading of another @entity5 reporter , @entity19 , was released by the @entity16 in the @entity0 version , the president 's voice is distorted slightly by a cackling sound to make it more ' edgy ' the @entity0 version also deliberately interferes with the image , taking away the colour , copying a tv drama the @entity0 video also uses an arabic script subtitle at the bottom of the screen , partly as a branding exercise @entity216 released tuesday by the self - proclaimed @entity0 ( @entity0 ) showed @entity5 journalist @entity4 ( @entity218 ) next to an unknown jihadi shortly before his execution by beheading he continued : ' because the more the @entity63 gets directly involved in the @entity221 the more they will alienate local @entity41			1
@entity64 will then use this alienation to get support from these rather moderate @entity41			0
as soon as @entity64 can make a case that the @entity63 is the near enemy in the @entity221 , the more dangerous the ideology of @entity64 becomes for the @entity63			0
the reason is that they will give is legitimacy in continuing their otherwise very un-islamic jihad			0
' dr @entity33 said he feels the most video is ' an act of desperation ' on behalf of @entity0 as most people have rejected their ideology			1
he said that @entity0 ' is mostly staffed with foreign mujahedeen often not speaking any @entity77 and little knowledge of @entity55 ' .			1

@entity0 media wing *accused* of using tv editing techniques for its terror videos
the broadcasts are similar to popular tv shows for *maximum* terror effect
experts fear the videos are being used to recruit new western @entity252
