the injured planet - hunter , @entity1 , was left crippled in space last year after @entity3 said it had given up attempts to fix the telescope			1
but all was not lost			0
rather than abandoning the spacecraft , a team of @entity1 engineers thought up an ingenious way to keep it running using the subtle pressure of sunlight			1
and now , their efforts have paid off , with @entity1 spotting its first alien world since being wounded by the loss of two of its gyroscope - like wheels in may 2013			2
located 180 light - years from @entity27 , toward the constellation @entity28 , the planet is too hot for life as we know it the planet , dubbed @entity34 , is 2 and a half times the diameter of @entity27 and follows a close , nine - day orbit around a star that is smaller and cooler than our sun. located 180 light - years from @entity27 , toward the constellation @entity28 , the planet is too hot for life as we know it			1
however , it is close enough to be studied by instruments , scientists claim			0
' like a phoenix rising from the ashes , @entity1 has been reborn and is continuing to make discoveries , ' study lead author @entity49 , of the @entity50 ( @entity50 ) , said in a statement			0
' even better , the planet it found is ripe for follow - up studies			0
' the artistic concept shows @entity1 operating in a new mission profile called @entity25			1
using publicly available data , astronomers have confirmed @entity25 's first exoplanet discovery proving @entity1 can still find planets @entity1 was launched in 2009 with the sole purpose of finding new stars and planets			2
during that time it has confirmed 132 planets and spotted more than 2,700 potential ones			0
several of these worlds are ' super-earths ' with up to 10 times the @entity27 's mass situated in ' habitable zone ' orbits where conditions may be suitable for life			0
in december 2011 , @entity1 found a new @entity27 - sized planet orbiting a star just 352 light years away			1
it was found lurking in the @entity1 star field and was named @entity1			2
in january last year , scientists used @entity1 's data to estimate that there are at least 17 billion @entity27 - sized exoplanet			1
in august 2013 , @entity3 announced that the broken planet - finding telescope wasto remain crippled in space after scientists gave up attempts to restore it to full working order			1
the spacecraft , which cost Â£ 395 million , was launched in march 2009 with the chief aim of searching for @entity27 - sized planets that might support life			0
@entity1 's onboard camera detects planets by looking for transits - when a distant star dims slightly as a planet crosses in front of it			1
the smaller the planet , the weaker the dimming , so brightness measurements must be exquisitely precise			0
to enable that precision , the spacecraft must maintain steady pointing			0
in may , data collection during @entity1 's extended prime mission came to an end with the failure of the second of four reaction wheels , which are used to stabilise the spacecraft			1
rather than giving up on the stalwart spacecraft , a team of scientists and engineers crafted a strategy to use pressure from sunlight as a ' virtual reaction wheel ' to help control the spacecraft			2
the resulting @entity25 mission promises to not only continue @entity1 's planet hunt , but also to expand the search to bright nearby stars that harbour planets that can be studied in detail and better understand their composition			1
@entity25 also will introduce new opportunities to observe star clusters , active galaxies and supernovae			1
the @entity1 probe was launched in 2009			0
since the @entity25 mission officially began in may , it has observed more than 35,000 stars and collected data on star clusters and dense star - forming regions small planets like @entity34 , orbiting nearby bright stars , are a scientific sweet spot for @entity25 as they are good prospects for follow - up ground studies to obtain mass measurements			1
using @entity25 's size measurements and ground - based mass measurements , astronomers can calculate the density of a planet to determine whether it is likely a rocky , watery or gaseous world			2
' the kepler mission showed us that planets larger in size than @entity27 and smaller than @entity156 are common in the galaxy , yet they are absent in our solar system , ' said @entity160 , @entity1 / @entity25 project scientist			2
' @entity25 is uniquely positioned to dramatically refine our understanding of these alien worlds and further define the boundary between rocky worlds like @entity27 and ice giants like @entity156			0
' since the @entity25 mission officially began in may , it has observed more than 35,000 stars and collected data on star clusters , dense star - forming regions , and several planetary objects within our own solar system			1
it is currently in its third campaign			0
the @entity1 probe has found hundreds of new planets			0
several of these worlds are ' super-earths ' with up to 10 times the @entity27 's mass situated in ' habitable zone ' orbits where conditions may be suitable for life			0

@entity3 said it had given up on fixing the planet - hunter in may 2013
but engineers kept it running using subtle pressure from sunlight
@entity1 has now spotted @entity194 *116454b* which is 180 light - years away
it is too hot for life as we know it , but can be studied by other probes
@entity1 's new mission , @entity25 , will given the stalwart @entity1 *teelscope* opportunities to observe star clusters , active galaxies and supernovae
