by @entity0 for @entity1 @entity2 hugs his wife @entity3 during a welcome home rally in @entity5 , @entity6 at age 15 , @entity2 was already feeling isolated from his father , who had grown distant from his family and leaned heavily on whiskey			1
then one morning the future congressman found his alcoholic father in bed , dead from an apparent heart attack at age 55			1
it 's a formative story the @entity18 ' 2012 vice presidential nominee has not fully told publicly before now			0
in an interview with @entity20 , @entity2 said the event shaped him as a politician and as a family man - and figures heavily into whether he will seek the presidency in 2016			1
' having not had a dad for a long time , it brings you much closer to your kids and your family , ' @entity2 said from @entity32 as he begins a tour to promote his new book , ' @entity35 : renewing the @entity36 '			1
as @entity2 weighs up a presidential campaign , talk turns to his three children			1
the oldest , @entity40 , is about to turn 13			0
@entity2 says he is not eager to spend even more time away from @entity41 , the small @entity6 town where he grew up and where he and his wife , @entity3 , have raised their own family			1
' one of the reasons why i 've always passed elected leadership positions up in the @entity54 - you know , speaker , leader , all the things people ask you to run for - is because it takes you away from your family even more , ' @entity2 said			1
' i 've made career decisions based upon family balance and part of that is because of my own upbringing and my own childhood			2
' during his turn as @entity65 's vice presidential nominee , @entity2 often returned to @entity41 on weekends			1
in the final weeks of the campaign , @entity3 and the children joined him on the plane or on bus tours that went on for hundreds of miles each day			0
former @entity18 presidential nominee @entity65 shakes hands with running mate @entity2 ( @entity71 ) during the final session of the @entity73 in @entity74 , @entity75 in 2012 @entity2 with his wife @entity3 and daughter @entity40 and sons @entity78 , left , and @entity80 , right , during a welcome home rally @entity2 's stint as @entity65 's number two lasted 87 days			1
a two - year presidential campaign would be tougher as well as longer , keeping his family traipsing through early nominating @entity86 , @entity88 , @entity89 and @entity90			2
and that is before the frenetic head - to - head race against the @entity94 nominee if he were to win the nomination			0
but in his new book , @entity2 lays the policy - heavy groundwork for a presidential campaign - or perhaps an expanded role in the @entity54			1
he is expected to give up the gavel of the @entity102 and shift to the powerful @entity103 early next year			0
while there is plenty of partisan criticism of president @entity107 and his @entity94 allies - he calls the @entity107 administration ' lawless ' - the book 's personal revelations are the ones that could soften his image as a hard - nosed budget negotiator			2
none is more personal than his father 's drinking			2
@entity2 has written a new book , titled ' @entity35 : renewing the @entity36 ' , in which he opens up about finding his father dead from alcohol @entity2 describes a morning phone call from his father 's assistant during the summer of 1986			1
the unexpected call roused the younger @entity2 after a late night working at the local @entity126			1
the assistant said @entity128 , a lawyer , had clients waiting for him at the office			0
@entity2 went looking for his father around their @entity41 home and checked his parents ' bedroom			1
' it was obvious i would n't be able to save him , ' he writes in the book			2
' his heart had stopped and he was gone			0
' years of drinking had taken their toll , @entity2 said			1
his father had struggled with alcohol addiction and at one point checked himself into an in - patient treatment program			0
he stayed sober for more than 20 years , but then slipped back into a pattern of whiskeys from the time he came home until the time he went to bed			0
' i 've never talked about it before , ' @entity2 said			2
he said the relationship with his father had ' atrophied ' , especially during the two years before the heart attack			0
' while he certainly tried to fight it , my dad 's addiction eventually won out , ' he writes			0
' over time , it made him more distant , irritable and stressed			0
before i lost him to a heart attack , whiskey had washed away some of the best parts of the man i knew			0
' his mother was visiting @entity163 when her husband died			0
the high school sophomore started planning for funeral services before his mother returned home and learned about the death			0
' i grew up real fast , ' @entity2 said			2
why , after not discussing his father 's struggles during previous campaigns , did @entity2 write about it now ? ' it would have been incomplete had i not discussed it , ' he said in the interview			1
' i thought it would have been too whitewashed had i not talked about it			0
