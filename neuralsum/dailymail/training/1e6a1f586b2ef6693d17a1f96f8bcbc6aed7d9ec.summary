even in victory , these are strange times at @entity2			1
the natives are restless and it will take more than a win over the 10 men of @entity7 to convince them that all is well at @entity9 under @entity10			1
supporters booed when @entity12 passed the ball back to his goalkeeper @entity14 in the first half			2
they made no secret of their disapproval in the second when @entity19 took off @entity20 immediately after he had won a penalty			1
until then , @entity9 had struggled to land a glove on a stubborn @entity7 side who played with @entity25 sandwiched between two banks of four			1
@entity9 beat @entity7 2 - 0 but @entity10 still has a lot to do before the natives are happy @entity29 is n’t the first to try it at @entity2 and he certainly wo n’t be the last			1
but the way @entity9 struggled to break down their opponents for so long was not lost on their fans			1
they chanted ‘ 4 - 4 - 2 ’ when @entity9 laboured to victory at @entity36 in january , and ‘ attack , attack , attack ’ here after @entity12 had sent a long pass back to @entity38			1
the frustration is never far from the surface			0
one can sympathise with both @entity19 and the supporters whom he is paid to please			0
at times this season @entity9 ’s performances have not only fallen short of the cavalier football under sir @entity49 , they have been positively joyless			2
@entity51 celebrates his opened alongside @entity52 as @entity9 beat @entity7 while @entity19 has tinkered with his tactics and personnel , the outcome has been largely the same			1
the 2 - 0 win over @entity7 followed an equally uninspiring 3 - 1 win over @entity58 on @entity9 ’s last home appearance when @entity60 scored two of the goals			1
despite spending more than a £ 150million last summer on a squad that was far from shoddy in the first place – bringing the likes of @entity67 and @entity20 with him to @entity68 – the @entity63 has clearly struggled to make @entity9 a sum of their parts			1
@entity71 was awful here , @entity20 full of running but offering little threat until he won the penalty with his last contribution of the game			2
@entity67 yet again struggled to impress for @entity9 and was subbed at half time a generation of fans brought up on the thrills and spills of the @entity49 era are having to make do with something altogether less entertaining and a lot of them simply do n’t like it			1
even @entity19 admits he is surprised they have been so patient at times			0
‘ in @entity91 , the white handkerchiefs would have come out , ’ he said in december , reflecting on his first six months in @entity89 football			0
‘ in @entity94 , they would have been whistling			0
in @entity95 , @entity96 , they would have been shouting for my “ friend ” @entity97			0
here they stand up and applaud			0
’ a relieved @entity9 celebrate @entity51 's opener against @entity7 at @entity2 that goodwill has since become a little strained , but here ’s the question			1
performances or points ? @entity49 delivered both but , for now , @entity9 fans may have choose one or the other			1
@entity19 has been hired to get @entity9 back into the @entity107			2
they are in third place with 11 games to go and through to the @entity111 quarter - finals after losing just two of their last 21 games			0
the alarming decline of the @entity117 era has been arrested , at least in terms of results			0
@entity19 has won a trophy in his first season everywhere else , and you would n’t bet against him doing it with @entity9 at @entity124 in may			2
just do n’t expect the @entity111 final to be a classic			0
@entity51 looks at @entity7 defender @entity127 as @entity128 is sent off after he was shown a red card if there ’s any consolation for supporters , @entity19 knows they deserve better			2
he has talked before about finding the ‘ perfect game ’ , about the players needing time to buy into his ‘ philosophy ’ before it all comes good			2
in his programme notes for this game he wrote : ‘ the signs in training , and also in some of the matches , show me that we are improving			0
what we are striving for now is that good all - round team performance when everything clicks into place			0
i am sure it is not far away			0
’ on the evidence of this performance , some fans will remain unconvinced .			0

two goals from @entity51 earned @entity9 all three points
but the hosts were yet again far from impressive in victory at @entity2
big money signing @entity67 was *hauled* off at half time of the win
@entity20 also struggled to impress *upfront* for the @entity164
