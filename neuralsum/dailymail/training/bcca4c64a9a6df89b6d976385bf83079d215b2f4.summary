he said : ' the sentence is reasonable in the circumstances			0
' however , had the charge of religiously aggravated assault not been dropped i 'm sure it would have been considerably longer and i fail to see why that charge was dropped given that he was wearing an @entity16 t - shirt and screaming about @entity70 at me			1
