by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 09:58 est , 24 june 2013 updated : 17:39 est , 24 june 2013 in a victory for affirmative action opponents , the @entity3 ruled in favor of @entity7 in a case that alleged the @entity9 rejected her application in favor of minority applicants with similar grades and test scores			1
the court sent the case back to a lower court for another look			0
the court 's 7 - 1 decision in @entity22 monday was a blow to advocates of the 35 - year - old law that boosts college admissions of @entity27 and other minorities			1
' i probably would have gotten a better job offer had i gone to @entity9 , ' she told the @entity44			1
another factor fueling @entity7 's lawsuit was that the university has produced diversity by automatically offering about three - quarters of its spots to graduates in the top 10 percent of their @entity52 high schools , under a 1990s state law signed by then - gov. @entity54			1
acting firmly : @entity7 maintains she was passed over for minority students who performed as well or not as well as she did in high school by @entity9 admissions taking action ? attorney @entity59 ( left ) , speaks to the media while standing with plaintiff @entity7 , after the @entity62 @entity61 heard arguments in her discrimination case in october 2012 the landmark @entity7 v. @entity9 case was only one among several groundbreaking cases that @entity3 has decided this week			1
some decisions have been announced , while others are still to come , including the long - awaited doma and @entity73 same - sex marriage cases			1
today 's decisions @entity75 : the court ruled in favor of @entity78 , making it harder for employees to sue employers for harassment because it ruled a person must be able to hire and fire someone to be considered a supervisor in such suits			0
@entity62 v. @entity87 : ruled that sex offenders may still be listed on sex offender registries even if they completed their sentences before the @entity92 and @entity93 came into law			0
@entity95 v. @entity96 : decided for the university , ruling that an employee who claims harassment and complains of subsequent punishment must show the punishment would not have occurred if not for the complaint			1
@entity103 : decided for the pharma company , not the woman whose skin fell off after using their drug , and ruled that federal law trumps state law in cases of the adequacy of drug warning labels			2
some rulings to come @entity115 v. @entity62 : this is the @entity71 case			1
@entity71 defines marriage as between one man and one woman at the federal level and opponents believe it 's unconstitutional			1
@entity124 : this is the case that will decide the constitutionality of @entity128 's 2008 voter - passed @entity73 that banned same - sex marriage @entity130 , @entity131 v. @entity132 : current law lets the federal government monitor voting in areas with a history of discrimination			1
opponents seek to strike down that aspect of the @entity140			0
that includes schools where the top level of achievement could be significantly lower than at higher - performing schools			0
it also includes schools where the student demographics skew toward minorities			0
@entity7 was a good student who played on the soccer team and graduated with a 3.59 grade point average			1
she graduated 82nd in a class of 674 , which put her close to the top 10 percent but not quite close enough , reports @entity153			2
the admissions program has been changed so that now only the top 8 percent gain automatic admission			0
according to @entity7 , minorities who graduated below her and who participated less in extracurricular activities at her high school were accepted to the flagship @entity9 system school			1
justice @entity161 wrote for the 7 to 1 majority			0
he said the @entity164 appeals court that sided with @entity52 originally did not scrutinize the case sufficiently enough and in accordance with the @entity3 's 2003 upholding of affirmative action			0
justice @entity168 stayed out of the case , presumably because she had some contact with it at an earlier stage when she worked in the @entity173			0
the compromise ruling throws out the decision by the @entity164 - based 5th @entity176 , which upheld the @entity52 admission plan			2
more than 8 in 10 african - american and @entity180 students who enrolled at the flagship campus in @entity182 in 2011 were automatically admitted , according to university statistics			2
even among the rest , both sides acknowledge that the use of race is modest			0
in all , black and @entity189 students made up more than a quarter of the incoming freshmen class			2
white students constituted less than half the entering class when students with @entity195 backgrounds and other minorities were added in			2
@entity52 argued that race is one of many factors considered and that whether race played the key role in any applicant 's case was impossible to tell			0
the @entity211 administration , roughly half of the @entity205 companies and large numbers of public and private colleges that feared a broad ruling against affirmative action backed the @entity52 program			2
among the benefits of affirmative action , the administration said , is that it creates a pipeline for a diverse officer corps that it called ' essential to the military 's operational readiness			0
' unfair ? @entity7 speaks to the media after @entity62 @entity3 heard arguments in her case in october			1
today , the court ruled in her favor , throwing out an earlier decision against her , sending it back to a lower court read the case of @entity22 ...			0

@entity7 sued the @entity9 after she was rejected from the school in 2008
@entity7 alleged a *preference* for minority students over *non-minorities* lost her a spot at the school
' i probably would have gotten a better job offer had i gone to @entity9 ' : @entity7 graduated instead from @entity238
no ruling monday on @entity71 or @entity73 *gay* marriage cases
