by @entity0 published : 07:14 est , 8 january 2013 updated : 20:11 est , 8 january 2013 despite being in her seventies , @entity1 could hardly be said to have gone off the boil			1
she remains the @entity5 ’s top cookery author – having sold more than 21million books – and the so - called ‘ @entity7 ’ is famed for having a huge impact on the sale of products used in her recipes , from sea salt to cranberries			2
however , the grand dame of tv cooking has been dropped as a face of @entity18 while the younger , trendier @entity19 is being retained			1
mr @entity19 ’s contract has been renewed and , as well as him featuring in new advertising , a @entity18 spokesman said his ‘ successful range will continue to excite our customers and push the boundaries of supermarket innovation ’			1
veteran cook @entity35 broke her life - time policy of refusing to advertise commercial brands when she signed a money - spinning tie - up with the firm three years ago			0
there was speculation then that her timing may have had something to do with a leaked report from executives inside the @entity45 that claimed she had ‘ limited appeal ’ and was in the bottom tier of the corporation ’s roster of presenting talent			0
@entity1 sticks to what she does best with a classic recipe enjoyed by thousands of people over the years			2
the combination of fruit soaked in brandy and mixed spice with nutmeg create a traditional festive flavour			0
@entity18 sells a £ 10 box with all the ingredients prepared and weighed out in advance			0
@entity19 let his imagination run wild to create an unusual twist on a @entity68 classic			2
a whole candied clementine hidden in the centre which infuses the entire pudding with strong citrus notes			0
the pudding is priced at £ 13.99 but the high demand has led it to be sold on ebay for £ 250			0
favourite : @entity19 's @entity74 has proved so popular it ended up on email for £ 250 ready to go : @entity76 prepared ingredients box gave customers a helping hand the @entity18 deal paired @entity35 , an outspoken critic of celebrity chefs who champion pretentious and fussy food , with three - @entity83 starred @entity84 chef mr @entity19 , 46 , famed for his offbeat concoctions such as snail porridge			1
it is not known how much both were paid but their annual fees are thought to run into six figures			0
confirmation that cookery ’s most unlikely double act has reached its sell - by date came yesterday in a @entity18 statement saying miss @entity1 ’s contract with them finishes next month when they will be bidding her a ‘ fond farewell ’			1
a spokesman said : ‘ @entity1 has other major projects and commitments coming up in 2013 and so , by mutual agreement , her contract will finish in february 2013			1
’ calls to @entity35 ’s manager were yesterday responded to by @entity18			0
sources said details of her new projects are likely to be revealed in the ‘ next few weeks ’			0
@entity18 marketing director @entity111 said : ‘ it has been such a fantastic experience working together and we have been really appreciative of the work @entity1 has done with @entity18			1
’ both @entity35 and mr @entity19 signed three - year contracts with @entity18 in march 2010 to take part in a campaign costing £ 10million			1
the partnership was also a first for @entity18 , which had never before used celebrity chefs to boost sales			2
in the campaign , the two personalities encouraged customers to cook meals from scratch and created recipe cards			0
they waived their fees for a low - budget @entity68 advert so that the money could go to the retailer ’s own community charities			0
miss @entity1 ’s departure was announced just days after @entity18 revealed record festive sales			1
the @entity19 - created @entity134 and @entity135 were among the store ’s top - sellers			2
@entity19 versus @entity1 unique : @entity19 's @entity84 restaurant is renowned for weird and wacky recipes , such as snail porridge different : @entity19 's @entity135 shaped as a @entity74 proved popular last month			1

@entity18 is looking to ' push the boundaries of supermarket innovation '
@entity1 , 71 , leaves by ' mutual *consent* ' with a record of boosting sales
@entity19 agrees new contract and will continue to create unique products
store remains ' on good terms ' with @entity1 who has ' several other projects '
