@entity0 has faced criticism over the past week for copying many @entity3 features on its larger @entity4 , but it appears this imitation goes both ways			1
just days after @entity0 added encryption by default to @entity10 , @entity7 has announced its next - generation @entity3 software will equally prevent law enforcement officers and governments getting their hands on user information			1
as with @entity0 ’s security tool , only people with passwords or passcodes for devices running @entity3 l will be able to access the files on it			1
once installed , it will encrypt data by default , and only people with the device or smartwatch 's ( @entity30 360 pictured right ) password will be able to access the files - preventing the police and governments getting access to it using a search warrant as with @entity0 , this means that if search warrants are served on @entity7 for the customer 's information , it wo n't legally be able to get hold of it			1
@entity7 began adding encryption tools to devices in 2011 and it was a standard feature of @entity46			2

however , the tool was optional and many users either did n’t know how to enable the feature , or were n’t aware it existed			1
to enable encryption on devices running @entity56 or @entity46 , plug the phone or tablet into charge			0
make sure the device remains connected to the power cable throughout			0
go to @entity62 , @entity63 and select @entity64			0
choose a pin or password and follow the steps			0
select the @entity69 option when prompted			0
encryption can take up to an hour , depending on how many files are stored on the device			0
however , the tool was optional and many users either did n’t know how to enable the feature , or were n’t aware it existed			1
any devices that upgrade to @entity78 next month will have this tool turned on by default , but it ca n’t be disabled			1
‘ as part of our next @entity3 release , encryption will be enabled by default out of the box , so you wo n't even have to think about turning it on , ’ said @entity7 ’s director of global communications and public affairs @entity84			1
‘ for over three years @entity3 has offered encryption , and keys are not stored off of the device , so they can not be shared with law enforcement			2
’ earlier this week , @entity0 launched a new privacy page , and the firm 's chief executive @entity97 wrote an open letter to customers			1
mr @entity97 said : ‘ at @entity0 , your trust means everything to us			0
' we ’re publishing this website to explain how we handle your personal information , what we do and do n’t collect , and why			0
‘ a few years ago , users of internet services began to realise that when an online service is free , you ’re not the customer			0
‘ but at @entity0 , we believe a great customer experience should n’t come at the expense of your privacy			0
’ @entity7 began adding encryption tools to devices in 2011 and it was a standard feature of @entity118 ( pictured )			1
however , the tool was optional and many users either did n’t know how to enable the feature , or were n’t aware it existed according to @entity0 's new privacy site , on devices running @entity124 8 , personal data including photos , messages - including attachments - email , contacts , call history , @entity132 content , notes , and reminders are placed under the protection of a user ’s passcode			1
‘ unlike our competitors , @entity0 can not bypass your passcode and therefore can not access this data , ’ continued the firm			2
‘ so it 's not technically feasible for us to respond to government warrants for the extraction of this data from devices in their possession running @entity124 8			0

mr @entity97 wrote : ' @entity0 can not bypass your passcode and therefore can not access this data			2
so it 's not technically feasible for us to respond to warrants from devices running @entity10 ' in march , @entity7 published a video that detailed the process it takes when responding to search warrants from law enforcement officers and governments ( screengrab pictured )			2
under the new rules , @entity7 will be able to legally decline requests for any information protected by a passcode , by default the reference to competitors is believed to have been an attack on @entity7 , which the firm has countered with its @entity3 l encryption announcement today			1
the rollout of new software to @entity7 devices , however , is significantly slower than @entity0			1
@entity0 can push updates to every device because it owns the hardware , but @entity3 runs on the devices of multiple manufacturers , which will have to roll out @entity3 l individually			1
this could take months , if not years			0
and data stored on @entity185 , as with @entity183 , is not encrypted automatically , so could still be retrieved with the appropriate warrant			0

@entity7 ’s @entity3 l software is *expected* to be released next month
once installed , it will encrypt data by default for the first time
the tool has been an optional feature since @entity118 was released
but many people did n’t know how to enable it or aware the tool existed
update means only people with the device ’s password can access the data
@entity0 announced it has added a similar feature to @entity10 earlier this week
