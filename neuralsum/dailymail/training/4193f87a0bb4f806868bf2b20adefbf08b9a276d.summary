by @entity0 are you afraid of the future ? that 's the gist of what a new @entity6 study out thursday asked @entity4			1
and the answer looks like no. though there are plenty of exceptions , @entity4 said they generally embrace the future of science and technology			1
however , a majority of @entity4 have a negative view of many up - and - coming technologies like drones , cybernetic implants or worn technologies like @entity21 and dna modification for humans			1
sorry @entity21 , the verdict is in and a majority of @entity4 find cyborg - like devices and implants too creepy they may be a boon for the folks at @entity32 but most @entity4 think drones are worrisome addition to our skies @entity36 is also out of luck with it 's driverless car , says the recent @entity6 study , which found that 50 percent would n't even get inside one example of where respondents to the @entity6 study was the driverless car			1
@entity36 wants us all to have our very own and laws are even springing up to help pave the way			0
but @entity6 found that 50 percent of @entity4 would not get inside one			1
also related to the tech giant was the finding that 53 percent think a future where people wear or implant technology that constantly feeds them information would be change for the worse			2
sorry @entity21 ! another internet company , @entity32 , will be interested to hear @entity6 's finding that 63 percent of @entity4 say opening @entity4 airspace to drones is a bad idea			2
while scientists recently managed to grow a hamburger in vitro , a huge 80 percent of @entity4 say they would decline to eat it			2
the @entity6 shows that @entity4 overall have a rosie view of technologies overall , but certain developments -- even those we 're on the cusp of making -- have them worried seems unlikely : a surprising 39 percent of @entity4 think teleportation could happen in their lifetimes and 66 percent feel that giving parents the ability to alter their baby 's dna to make them smarter , healthier or more athletic would be a dangerous thing			1
despite their trepidations , 59 percent of @entity4 think technological changes in general will have a positive effect on society			2
unlike food , we 're comfortable with lab grown organs at least in as much as 80 percent of adults believe such things will be improving our lives within 50 years			0
but plenty of potential advancements that have become sci - fi staples just do n't seem likely as much as we 'd like them to come to be			0
a surprising 39 percent of adults think scientitists will have invented teleportation in 50 years			0
a healthy 56 percent have their doubts			0
sixty - four percent think long - term space colonies are too far fetched and back on earth , 77 percent doubt we 'll be controlling the weather in 50 years			0
life outside of earth seems on the horizon for 33 percent of respondents most doubt we 'll be zapping away hurricanes any time soon			0

many @entity4 are *deeply* wary of many of the technologies we 're at the cusp of reaching
meanwhile , 6 in 10 @entity4 say future advancements will lead to a better life for people
