by @entity0 landmark discovery : the brain of someone with @entity4 , which can leave sufferers unable to walk - but new treatment could reverse the effects of the disease a new treatment for @entity4 not only stops the disease from advancing but may help patients recover from disability			1
remarkable results for the drug alemtuzumab mean it has been approved for use on the @entity17 and is now available in @entity18			2
originally a pioneering cancer therapy , @entity21 scientists have spent almost 25 years developing it as a treatment for @entity4 sufferers			1
trials involving more than 1,500 patients show treatment led to fewer relapses compared with multiple jabs of the treatment beta interferon each week , cutting further disability and even allowing some existing damage to recover			2
alemtuzumab is given in two short courses with one infusion a day for five days during the first year and three days during the second year followed by regular monitoring			1
despite the £ 56,000 price tag , the drug has got the go - ahead as cost - effective from the rationing watchdog the @entity42 ( @entity42 )			1
professor @entity43 , professor of neurology and the @entity45 at the @entity21 , said the drug worked in the early stages of @entity4 , but did not help patients with advanced disease			1
@entity4 affects almost 100,000 @entity50 , causing attacks or relapses that may lead to progressive loss of physical skills , sensation , vision , bladder control , and intellectual abilities			0
about 2,500 people are diagnosed each year , with four out of five having relapsing - remitting @entity4 - many of them in their 20s and 30s			2
prof @entity43 said more than half of patients with this type of @entity4 could benefit			0
he said ‘ this is a real step forward and brings to a conclusion work involving a number of research groups in @entity21 , stretching back to 1991			1
‘ the decision from @entity42 now provides an opportunity for neurologists to offer a highly effective therapy for patients with multiple sclerosis early in the course of their illness			1
’ alemtuzumab , marketed as @entity77 by makers @entity78 , was being used in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia when prof @entity43 identified its potential for treating ms. patients take the treatment , which took 25 years to develop , in two doses over two years it works by destroying a key class of immune cells that are attacking the body ’ s healthy nerve cells and then rebooting the immune system so it no longer turns on itself			1
a main side effect is patients can develop other autoimmune diseases as the immune system gradually recovers following exposure to the drug			0
these include thyroid problems and a low blood platelet count that can rarely can prove fatal			0
platelets are cells that circulate in the blood and clot to keep us from bleeding			0
the complications can be easily treated if promptly recognised which makes monthly blood tests essential , said prof @entity43			0
‘ this drug offers a bright future but it is coloured by the risk			0
‘ it ’s not a cure and it does n’t work for everyone but it can stabilise the disease for a long time			0
patients are less disabled , they can look after their families and the societal savings are considerable ’ he added			0
‘ this drug offers a bright future but it is coloured by the risk ' - professor @entity43 at @entity21 unlike most treatments newly approved for @entity17 use , patients do n’t have to try other drugs first and more than two courses of treatment may be offered			1
prof @entity43 said ‘ twenty years ago when a young person was diagnosed , i ’d have to say i ’m sorry to tell you that you do have ms – we ’ll do our best to look after you but there are limited treatments			2
‘ today this drug may well be suitable for 50 to 60 per cent of early cases			0
’ @entity132 , director for @entity133 at the @entity134 , said it was ‘ a major step forward ’			0
he said ‘ this drug has taken decades to develop , and we applaud the team at @entity21 for all their work in making it a reality			1
‘ while it ’s not without risk , it ’s proven to be a highly effective medicine for people with relapsing remitting @entity4 and we look forward to seeing it made available to those who could benefit			2
’ @entity150 , of the @entity151 said ‘ this provides people with @entity4 with an important treatment option to consider in partnership with their @entity4 specialists			2

scientists have spent 25 years developing treatment at @entity21
alemtuzumab infusion is given in two short courses over two years
despite costing £ 56,000 , @entity42 has ruled treatment is cost - effective
