a university professor in @entity1 , @entity2 , has moved into a 33sq ft dumpster , which he plans to call home for an entire year			1
dr. @entity5 , a @entity6 - educated environmental science professor , took up residence in the trash can tuesday in an effort to show students at @entity11 , and the world , that humans can live on a smaller scale and lessen our environmental impact			1
thankfully for @entity5 , who 's now known as professor @entity18 , his new home is n't your ordinary smelly dumpster but will be getting kitted out by his students so it includes creature comforts like a shower , kitchen , bed , @entity26 and toilet			1
' the idea here is to ultimately show one can have a pretty good life in a dumpster , ' @entity5 told @entity45			1
however , the dumpster is starting off modestly			0
tuesday night , the 6ft 1in professor @entity18 posted a picture of his new abode on @entity49 with a maroon sleeping bag laid out tightly in the small space with little else in view			1
if occasionally @entity5 needs a break from the box , students can opt to take his place for the night			2
one student , @entity57 , has already signed up			0
mod cons : thankfully for @entity5 , pictured , his new home is n't your ordinary smelly dumpster but a special version customized by his students that includes creature comforts like a shower , kitchen , bed , @entity26 and toilet not very big : @entity5 posted a picture of his new home on @entity49 tuesday with the comment ' @entity72 of dumpster home at bedtime ' ' i think it 's pretty intriguing , ' she told @entity78			1
' it 's pretty cool			0
i want to live in it too			0
' after the year of dumpster living is up , @entity5 plans on taking the bin across the @entity83 , educating students about the possibility of following in his ' less is more ' footsteps			1
@entity5 said the project idea came to him two years ago while he was sipping a latte at @entity89			0
' i looked out the window into the parking lot and saw an eight - yard dumpster and had some sort of strange flash that i was definitely moving into a dumpster , ' he told @entity45			0
so when the lease ran out on his lovely , full - sized , apartment a year later , he posted an announcement on @entity99 , which read : ' starting at 6pm , i will be selling all of my home furnishings , clothes , kitchen appliances , and everything else in the apartment for $ 1 an item			2
' help : @entity5 , right , had help from students and other educators including dr @entity109 , pictured concerns : a week before move in , @entity5 wrote a list of his concerns with ' heating ' number one despite , the five - item - per - person maximum , his home was empty by nightfall except for a modest suitcase , which was coming with him to the dumpster			1
however , the dumpster was n't ready at this stage , so he moved into his office for the next seven months , secretly sleeping on the floor			2
' keeping that secret for seven months , especially from the 3 a.m. cleaning staff and 24 - hour security , much less the students and my colleagues , was interesting in itself , ' he told the website			0
but the low - impact living experiment , officially known as @entity135 , is finally ready to begin - and it has the university 's backing			2
scrub : five days ago , @entity5 was giving his dumpster a clean out cute : @entity5 posted a picture of him and his girlfriend two weeks ago with the comment , ' honey , i 'm home			2
this place looks like a dump ' vs : @entity5 's previous front porch was slightly more desirable ' i 'm essentially becoming part of the 1 per cent , he jokes			1
' this dumpster is 33 sq ft , which is 1 per cent the size of the new @entity83 home ... ' but as he undergoes this transformation , so will his students in campus dorms , whom he 'll expect to replace light - bulbs and install low - flow shower heads			1
the goal is to bring sustainability to the center of the college experience			0
' what we are talking about right now is to start a green movement within historically black colleges and universities , and become the flagship school of that , under an initiative called " @entity172 is the @entity173 , " ' he told @entity45			0
in the meantime , @entity5 says he 's going to take his dumpster life one day at a time			2
' it 's going to be pretty overwhelming , ' he said			0
' i ca n't think too far ahead in this project and stay sane			0

dr. @entity5 , a @entity6 - educated environmental science professor at @entity11 in @entity1 , moved into the dumpster tuesday
the experiment is designed to show students , and the world , that humans can live on a smaller scale and lessen our environmental footprint
thankfully for @entity5 , who 's now known as professor @entity18 , his new home is n't your ordinary smelly dumpster
it will be getting kitted out by his students so it includes creature comforts like a shower , kitchen , bed , @entity26 and toilet
