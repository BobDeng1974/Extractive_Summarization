by @entity0 @entity2 goalkeeper @entity1 faces a tough battle to keep his no. 1 spot at @entity5 next season			1
city boss @entity7 sees £ 6milion summer signing @entity8 as providing real competition for @entity1 who was pictured last week partying in @entity12 with international team - mate @entity13 after @entity2 ’s disastrous early exit from the @entity15			1
@entity7 , who managed @entity16 at @entity18 side @entity17 , is unconvinced by @entity1 ’s kicking and judgement as he seeks a modern ' keeper sweeper ' in the mould of @entity23			1
challenge ahead : @entity1 faces a battle with @entity8 for the goalkeeper spot at @entity5 new by : @entity16 signed for the @entity27 champions in a £ 6million switch from @entity17 while @entity1 ’s physical attributes are of huge benefit in ordinary @entity27 games , they are not as important against top clubs or in the @entity34			1
@entity1 was dropped for two months last season after rushing from his goal to allow @entity37 to score a late winning goal for @entity39 against @entity5			2
significantly , @entity7 was asked whether he could sign an @entity41 understudy to @entity1 following the departure of @entity43 to boost @entity5 ’s homegrown quota			1
but the manager insisted he went overseas for 32 - year - old @entity16 knowing that a reliable goalkeeper is vital for @entity5 ’s chances in @entity48			2
they have failed to get past the round of 16 in the @entity34 despite an investment of more than £ 1billion since 2008			0

the @entity55 were only eliminated by an injury - time goal by eventual finalists @entity58			0
mr. reliable : @entity16 helped @entity17 reach the quarter - finals of the @entity34 back in 2013 it will be interesting to see how @entity1 reacts to the first serious threat to his long - term place at @entity5			2
he said in interviews last season that being left out by @entity7 had been a kick up the @entity67 the 27 - year - old failed to impress at the @entity15 and knows he can not afford to be on the sidelines for the majority of the season			0
for a quiet and undemonstrative man , @entity7 has displayed an enormous amount of independence since succeeding @entity74 at the @entity75 and was rewarded by winning the @entity27 and @entity77 last season			0
he has resisted the long - term plan of the club ’s former @entity80 executives feran @entity82 and @entity83 to duplicate the tactics of @entity85 , who they still want to lure to the @entity75 when he leaves @entity87			0
independent : city boss @entity7 guided the club to the @entity27 title last season			1
