by @entity0 published : 15:49 est , 19 february 2013 updated : 15:49 est , 19 february 2013 burly : enforcers @entity1 and @entity3 , pictured looking back , went to @entity5 's home armed with a @entity7 writ taken out against the millionaire a wealthy businessman threatened two bailiffs with a shotgun after they tricked their way into his country home to seize over Â£ 1.2 million worth of property , a court heard			1
the burly enforcers went armed with a @entity7 writ taken out against millionaire @entity5 , director of a company that sells aircraft and parts			1
@entity1 and @entity3 were refused entry when they arrived at the gates of 62 - year - old @entity5 's home @entity24 in @entity25 , @entity26 , on july 31 last year			1
but they found a gap in bushes surrounding the property , knocked down a fence and managed to reach the front door			1
when @entity5 , whose business interests include @entity34 , @entity35 and @entity36 , answered the door he was served with the writ			1
he still refused entry but allowed them into the house to photocopy the writ			1
once inside , mr @entity1 and mr @entity3 saw their chance to start seizing property , @entity43 heard			1
mr @entity1 told a judge : ' i said : " as i am in the house , we are going to have to levy on all the goods in the house			1
' ' mr @entity5 was not very happy about this and said no , we could n't			1
he tried to forcibly eject me			2
mrs @entity54 appeared and asked us to leave			1
' mr @entity5 said if we did n't leave the premises he was going to get a gun			1
my colleague advised him it would not be a very good idea and if he did he would get himself in a lot of trouble			2
mrs @entity54 insisted we left and said we were trespassing and she would call the police			2
we told her we were not going to leave and if she wanted to call the police that was fine by us			2
' mr @entity5 appeared in the hallway with a double barrel shotgun			1
it was on his shoulder pointing in our direction in the firing position			2
worrying : @entity43 , pictured , was told that mr @entity5 appeared in the hallway of his home with a double barrel shotgun ' he said : " get out of my house			1
" he pointed the gun towards my legs			2
he said : " if you do n't get out i am going to shoot you in the legs			2
' my reaction was : " that 's fine , we will leave the house "			2
asked by prosecutor @entity83 what was going through his mind , he replied : ' what was going through my mind was i was going to end up with no legs			0
' the bailiffs left the house , called the police and waited outside the gates			0
mr @entity1 , who worked for @entity93 , denied a suggestion by @entity95 , defending , that they broke down a metre - high garden fence to get into the grounds			1
mr @entity3 said of the gun incident : ' i could see by his face he meant it			1
i was in a bit of a state and panicking			0
' mr @entity102 told him : ' you could have been a couple of bandits			1
' @entity5 admitted possessing a firearm with intent to cause fear of violence but disputed that he aimed the gun at the bailiffs			1
his solicitor and son - in - law @entity113 said the writ resulted from a civil action in which the businessman was one of the defendants			2
he said of the bailiffs : ' i said it sounded like trespass			0
their aim was to empty the house of everything they could lay their hands on			0
it was an unwarranted and insane idea			0
' there was a @entity128 in one of the garages			0
their eyes lit up at that point			0
a low loader was ordered ( to take it away )			0
' the court heard @entity5 's wife @entity136 had just finished breakfast when the bailiffs arrived			1
oil had been stolen from their property the previous day			2
the gun was used by their son for clay pigeon shooting			0
saying she felt ' extremely vulnerable ' , she maintained the bailiffs had broken in by forcing the stock fence and damaging the hawthorn and holly hedge			0
mrs @entity54 said she repeatedly asked them to leave the house before her husband told them : ' if i get a gun would that persuade you to leave ? ' she heard him say : ' and now will you leave ? ' ' i looked over my right shoulder and he was pointing at the floor , ' she added			0
she denied that her husband either pointed the gun at the men or threatened to shoot one of them in the legs			0
@entity5 was sentenced to six months imprisonment suspended for two years with 150 hours unpaid work after judge @entity169 found he could not be sure what position the gun was held in			1
he said @entity5 , who also owns a gym in @entity173 and is a co-driver in rallying with @entity175 , acted ' foolishly ' by fetching the gun and could have calmed down at any stage			1
but he added the two bailiffs had been equally foolish , and even ' deceptive '			0
' i do not find that the criminal standard of proof has been satisfied and @entity182 sentence on the basis that the defendant unwisely , foolishly , brought in a gun which was broken and not loaded , ' said the judge			0
' the defendant did by his actions threaten the two bailiffs and his actions were foolish , overdramatic , grandstanding and the bailiffs were behaving in a foolish and deceptive way and were not really frightened			0
' all the parties over-reacted in what may be described as a childish and foolish way			0
' judge @entity197 said @entity5 's behaviour would have caused fear but nothing like as first suggested by the bailiffs			1
he added that use of a firearm to threaten or intimidate could not be tolerated and there had to be a deterrent sentence			0
the bailiffs , he said , had broken into the property by knocking the fence down and going through the hedge			2
their ' misbehaviour ' went further and had fuelled the situation			0
he described them as ' incompetent and belligerent ' and said it seemed remarkable to suggest they were experienced bailiffs			0
' they lacked the professionalism and any understanding of the regulations concerning what they were permitted to do and their evidence was contradictory , ' he said			0
' their attitude inflamed the situation and they went into the house completely uninvited			0
mr @entity5 undoubtedly considered genuinely that he had been tricked , as he had			1

burly enforcers went armed with a writ taken out against @entity5
@entity1 and @entity3 were refused entry to property gate
but they reached front door after finding a gap in bushes
mr @entity5 later appeared in his hallway with a double barrel shotgun
