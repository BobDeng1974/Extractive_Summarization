by @entity0 for @entity1 if having your own gun tower is n't quite enough for the wow factor , few things can beat saying you live at what some say is the world 's best address - @entity8 , @entity10			1
this 150 - year - old sea defence , known as the @entity12 , is based on a spit of land 1km off the @entity15 , @entity16 , where the @entity10 and the @entity17 meet - and is now up for sale for £ 500,000			1
but , despite the unrivalled sea views and certainty for privacy , there are some drawbacks - including the fact you can only get there during low tide			1
at high tide , the tower is completely cut off from the mainland and is accessible only by boat or helicopter			1
although the @entity68 - style property was modified during @entity69 , it has barely been touched since			2
the huge bomb - proof building , which is set over 2,300sqm of space , was built in the 1855 and bought from @entity58 by builder @entity71			1
despite wanting to turn it into his dream home , mr @entity71 has not managed to develop the property			0
the former fort is marooned off the coast of the mainland , with nothing surrounding it apart from water the house is being billed as the ideal potential home for a city boys , who wants to commute to work by speedboat the fort 's original purpose was to serve as a key military installation , protecting @entity91 and @entity92 dockyards , as well as the @entity10 the fort boats stunning sea views back onto the mainland , uninterrupted by any other homes or boats , as shown above although its day as an estuary gun emplacement are long gone - and despite being in a dilapidated state - the imposing fort is still thought to be bomb proof but he has drawn up plans to show how the former fort - which has 15ft - thick walls - could look when renovated			1
while the estate agents are billing it as the perfect home for a city boy who wants to commute by speedboat , mr @entity71 's dream is to see a house boat marina and a water and outdoor sports centre			0
the plans also show the potential to turn the fort into a mid-river nightclub or restaurant			0
@entity121 , director of @entity122 , said : ' we sell lots of very nice properties but we ’ve never sold a fort			1
but despite having an enviable position on @entity10 , a lot of work needs to be done to turn the 19th century property into a liveable home the current owner , builder @entity71 , bought the home ten years ago but did not manage to spend the time renovating the property estate agent @entity121 , director of @entity137 , said that an estimated £ 1million needs to be spent on the property for it to be turned into a dream home mr @entity121 said it is ' an amazing building ' and that he is ' in awe ' of its potential			1
he said it could be turned into something ' really special ' the property originally had an enormous gun on the roof			0
in 1912 , two @entity150 guns were moved to the tower			0
during the @entity69 , it had a pair of six pounder @entity150 guns installed ' i am in awe of what an amazing building it is and its potential , which would be subject to planning permission and negotiations with @entity164 heritage			0
' it could be transformed into something really special - a stunning home , a hotel , a sanctuary or something to do with outdoor pursuits			0
there are so many possibilities			0
' the seller has owned it for around ten years and he does n’t have the time to do anything with it			0
i think you would probably look at spending a minimum of £ 1 million turning it into a home			0
' the fort 's original purpose was to serve as a key military installation , protecting @entity91 and @entity92 dockyards as well as @entity10			1
this map shows the remote location of @entity8 , the @entity10 - just off the @entity15 , where the two rivers meet current owner @entity71 , who bought the fort ten years ago , has commissioned a set of plans to show what the fort could look like			1
the estate agent said it could be turned into a private residence , an off - shore hotel , a houseboat community , a film location , a nightclub or a casino this architect 's image shows the revamped fort being used as a hotel or club , with a permanent walkway attached this internal image of the proposed renovations , produced by @entity210 , shows the building being used as a club or bar , something which the estate agent said is very plausible pictured are plans which show the outside and inside of the fort if it were to be converted into a bar			2
mr @entity121 said : ' it could be transformed into something really special - there are so many possibilities ' the property - 4.6miles from its nearest train station , @entity225 - originally had an enormous gun on the roof			1
in 1912 two 4.7 @entity150 guns were moved to the tower			0
during the @entity69 , it had a pair of six pounder @entity150 guns installed and a two - storey red brick barracks was built on stilts , to house 60 soldiers			2
although its days as an estuary gun emplacement are long gone - and despite being in a dilapidated state - it is still thought to be bomb proof			2
with a guide price of £ 500,000 , the fort is around three times the average price of a home sold in @entity164 and @entity243 last month			2
but it is also the same price that a developer paid for three garages in @entity248 last month .			0

the bomb - proof 150 - year - old sea defence is sat 1km off the @entity15 , @entity16 , where the @entity17 and @entity10 meet
the fort , known as @entity12 , can only be accessed by a half - mile walk at low tide , or by boat or helicopter
it was built in 1855 to protect @entity91 and @entity92 dockyards , was used in @entity69 and has its own gun tower
agent @entity121 - who said it needs £ 1m renovation - said : ' we **'ve** sold nice buildings , but we **'ve** never sold a fort '
