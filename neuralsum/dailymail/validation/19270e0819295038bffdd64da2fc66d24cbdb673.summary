it ’s the wonder material that ’s 200 times stronger than steel and one million times thinner than human hair , which is set to revolutionise electronics , medicine and transport			1
now graphene is set to make its commercial debut in the form of a light bulb in a ‘ matter of months ’			1
the bulb contains a filament - shaped led coated in the super-strong carbon and is set to go on sale late 2015			1
the dimmable bulb contains a filament - shaped led coated in the super-strong carbon , which was co-discovered by sir @entity17 ( pictured left )			1
here , chancellor @entity18 examines the bulb @entity21 researchers behind the bulb claim it will last longer and be cheaper to make than conventional leds , as well as slash energy use by 10 per cent			1
it looks like a traditional light bulb , but the graphene coating enables it to conduct electricity and heat more effectively , to facilitate the improved performance , meaning users wo n't have to change their bulbs as regularly			1
it was designed at the @entity35 , where graphene was discovered , and will be made by @entity37 , a @entity21 - registered company that ’s a spin - out from the university			1
professor @entity40 , deputy vice-chancellor at the university told the @entity42 : ‘ the graphene light bulb will use less energy			1
we expect it to last longer			0
‘ the manufacturing costs are lower and it uses more and more sustainable components			0
’ the innovative product looks like a traditional light bulb , but the graphene coating enables it to conduct electricity and heat more effectively , to facilitate the improved performance			1
an illustration of the structure of graphene is shown , made from a honeycomb lattice of carbon atoms graphene is a single atomic layer of carbon atoms bound in a hexagonal network			0
it not only promises to revolutionise semiconductor , sensor , and display technology , but could also lead to breakthroughs in fundamental quantum physics research			0
it is often depicted as an atomic - scale chicken wire made of carbon atoms and their bonds			0
scientists believe it could one day be used to make transparent conducting materials , biomedical sensors and even extremely light , yet strong , aircraft of the future			0
similar to another important nanomaterial - carbon nanotubes - graphene is incredibly strong - around 200 times stronger than structural steel			1
the university said in a statement : ‘ it is expected that the graphene light bulbs will be on the shelves in a matter of months , at a competitive cost			1
’ this implies that the graphene bulbs may cost less than @entity13 bulbs , which can be priced at around £ 15			1
the graphene light bulb is thought to be the first commercial application of graphene to emerge from the @entity21 ’s £ 61 million @entity92 ( @entity93 ) , which was opened in @entity35 last week by the chancellor , @entity18			1
the wonder material was isolated by university researchers sir @entity97 and sir @entity17 , earning them the @entity98 in 2010			0
now more than 200 researchers are studying the material at @entity35 to unlock its commercial potential			1
while the material is difficult to make in large quantities , graphene could one day lead to lighter and more efficient forms of transport such as planes			2
in the shorter term , it could lead to thinner , lighter , tougher and more efficient smartphones , laptops and wearables such as smartwatches , which could be charged much faster than they can now			0
the graphene light bulb is thought to be the first commercial application of graphene to emerge from the @entity21 ’s £ 61 million @entity92 ( pictured ) , which opened in @entity35 last week medical researchers are also excited , because graphene could be used to make nanotechnologies , which could one day provide better cancer treatments , for example and a filter system could create safe drinking water from salt water			1
professor @entity40 said : ‘ this light bulb shows that graphene products are becoming a reality , just a little more than a decade after it was first isolated – a very short time in scientific terms			2
‘ this is just the start			0
our partners are looking at a range of exciting applications , all of which started right here in @entity35			2
‘ it is very exciting that the @entity93 has launched its first product despite barely opening its doors yet			0
’ more than 35 companies have partnered with the university to incorporate graphene into products , such as @entity147 , a company that makes tennis rackets			0
graphene is the most conductive material in the world , but because it is thin and flat it does n’t have the surface area needed to be used in batteries			1
to increase the size and shape of this so - called super-material , scientists in @entity157 have used graphene 's sheet - like structure to create ‘ pom - poms ’			2
the 3d structures were made by dropping graphene oxide into hot solvent - a process that has been likened to deep - frying food			2
to increase the surface area of graphene , in order to make it transfer more charge and make it more suitable for use in batteries , scientists at the @entity169 in @entity170 created graphene ‘ pom - poms ’ ( pictured )			2
these 3d spheres were formed by dropping graphene oxide into hot solvent deep - fried pom - poms of graphene could ultimately make batteries in phones and tablets smaller , efficient , and more capable of storing and transferring charge			2
@entity189 and his colleagues at @entity169 , in @entity170 put flakes of graphene oxide into an ultrasonic nozzle , which used sound waves to create microdroplets			0
these microdroplets were when sprayed into a mixture of organic solvent and ascorbic acid , at temperatures of 160 ° @entity202 )			0
in the solvent and acid , the graphene oxide was turned into graphene , the water in the droplets evaporated , and the resulting spheres resembled pom - poms			2
as they formed , nanosheets in the graphene spilled out from the centre , creating ‘ waves ’ of particles			0
this created so - called nanochannels , which increased the area in which charge could be transferred			0
early tests with the graphene pom - poms showed that they performed better as electrodes compared to typical sheets of graphene .			0
