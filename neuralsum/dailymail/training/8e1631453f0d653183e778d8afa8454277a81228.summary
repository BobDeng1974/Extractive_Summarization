by @entity0 a couple were left shocked when workmen accidentally threw away their bespoke ' kitchen for life ' worth almost £ 10,000 - and binmen mistook it for rubbish			1
@entity7 , 51 , and partner @entity8 , 53 , were having some new electrical wire installed in their house in @entity12 , @entity13 , when they realised their kitchen fittings had been taken away to the tip , leaving their expensive kitchen a gutted husk			1
the contractors had taken down all of the kitchen units , cupboards and surfaces in order to fit the wiring in the walls , and placed them at the back of the house - only for binmen to take them away			1
@entity7 , 52 , in the husk of her now - gutted kitchen after workmen inadvertently threw the £ 9,500 fittings out the mistake cost the couple £ 9,500 , and now they are left searching for a new kitchen			2
ms @entity7 and mr @entity8 were in the midst of having their kitchen repaired by contractors who were working on behalf of @entity43 , who were carrying out the work as a part of their ' @entity48 ' programme			1
because the couple loved their bespoke kitchen , they declined the offer of a new one , but still needed some rewiring and a new bathroom			2
ms @entity7 , said : ' we got our own kitchen put in about five years ago and we spent £ 9,500 on it			2
' i love cooking and baking so i spend a lot of time in , and we wanted something that was going to last - that was meant to be our kitchen for life			0
' they have accepted blame , but what i do n't understand is if they put the cupboards outside , they must have known they had to bring them back in when they were done , and if the cupboards were missing then why did n't they say anything ? the workmen had left the fittings outside next to the bins while they had carried out the electrical wire renovations , where the binmen mistook the expensive cabinets for rubbish @entity7 was having renovations to her @entity12 house as a part of the @entity48 - but had declined a kitchen renovation because she was happy with her £ 9,500 kitchen ' we told the council that we did n't want a new kitchen off them and were happy to keep the one we had			1
' the workers needed to take the top cupboards off the walls to do the re-wiring			0
' the story is that to make more room for themselves , they put the cupboards out in the back yard then a binman , who was going around collecting rubbish , came and took them away			0
' it was n't until the next day that i started sorting through boxes and things in the kitchen and noticed they were n't anywhere in the house			2
' @entity7 , a support worker for people with brain injuries , said she contacted housing bosses , who held their hands up and admitted fault straight away			0
ms @entity7 has been offered a new kitchen by the housing authority , which has admitted they were in error , but she feels she has n't been offered one of the same standard the couple have been told they can choose a replacement kitchen as means of compensation , but they say they have yet to be offered one they feel is of the same quality or value to the units they lost			1
a spokesman for @entity43 said : ' this was a genuine mistake on behalf of the contractor , which has accepted responsibility and apologised for the error			0
' the contractor has assured us they are working very hard to resolve the issue and have offered the tenant a range of options to try to progress this as quickly as possible			0
' we are waiting to hear back from mr @entity8 to take this forward			0

contractors were working on the house in @entity13 fitting new wiring
they removed the cabinets and surfaces to access the walls
workers put the kitchen items outside , where binmen took them
the couple have since been offered a new kitchen by @entity43
however , they feel they have n't been offered one of the same quality
