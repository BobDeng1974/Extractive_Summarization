a 200 - year - old mystery that links a castle in a @entity3 town , a mysterious ' @entity4 ' and the @entity6 royal family may be on the cusp of finally being solved			1
in 1807 a covered carriage arrived in the central @entity3 town of @entity10			1
a man , now known to be @entity12 , a secretary in the @entity14 embassy in @entity15 from july 1798 to april 1799 , got out			0
with him was an enigmatic and secretive young woman who would go on to fire the imaginations of historians everywhere			2
end of the mystery ? a digger clears the earth during the exhumation of the grave of so - called ' dark countess ' in @entity10 , @entity3 known as the ' @entity4 ' , many believed she was none other than @entity28 - daughter of the @entity6 @entity29 and his wife , @entity30 , who were executed during the @entity31			1
rarely seen in public and always veiled , she lived under the protection of the @entity34 and @entity35 in castle of @entity37			1
now a team of archaeologists , supported by @entity40 , may be about to shed light on a secret that has gone unsolved for more than two centuries			0
the grave is being opened to find out if it contains the remains of ' @entity46 ' , the @entity6 princess @entity47 who was said to be the sole surviving member of the @entity6 royal family after the revolution in 1789 resting place : @entity52 , director of the local municipal museum , holds what are believed to be pieces of the coffin and nails during the exhumation they are exhuming her grave to collect dna evidence that can prove once and for all whether the @entity4 was in fact the ill - fated princess			2
princess @entity28 , pictured around the time she left @entity6 after her parents were guillotined @entity28 was imprisoned in the ' @entity67 ' , a notorious former fortress used as a prison during the @entity70			1
accepted historical dogma is that afterwards she was taken to @entity72 , the capital city of her cousin , the holy roman emperor @entity75 , and also her mother 's birthplace			0
it was speculated that she would have refused to rejoin society after her traumatic time in the @entity67 , where it is rumoured she was subjected to cruelties by the guards - and perhaps even pregnant from rape - and was replaced by @entity84 , her half - sister and childhood companion			1
the count gave her name as @entity88 , a single woman from @entity89 and refused to confirm what the relationship between the pair was			2
when she died in november 1837 she was quickly buried , possibly without a religious service , intensifying the speculation			0
a physician said she appeared to be around 60 years old when she died - which would match the age of @entity28			1
' i am personally convinced that the @entity46 , the @entity6 king 's daughter , is buried here , ' said mayor @entity102 , reports @entity103			0
he welcomes the grave opening , but many residents want to prevent it to maintain the air of mystery surrounding a tale that would not look out of place in a @entity113 novel			0
