the huge container port of @entity1 was at rest yesterday as church bells called sunday worshippers to prayer			1
under a leaden sky , @entity6 huddled against the breeze drinking tea in beach huts , while kite - surfers skimmed across the sea next to the port where hundreds of metal containers – piled like giant @entity16 bricks and stamped with @entity18 company names – waited on the concrete to be lifted on to ferries for @entity22 crossings next week			1
this is the port at the centre of a new immigration controversy : where 35 migrants , including children , were crammed into a container on a @entity30 ship which set sail to @entity32 in @entity33 on friday night			1
on saturday at 6.15am , when the container was lifted off the boat on to the @entity32 dockside , the exhausted migrants screamed to be let out as their air inside began to give out			2
it had been a nightmare journey of nine hours across the @entity22 in the dark , airless 40ft long metal box			0
however the terrifying odyssey at least ended in the only country the migrants wanted to reach : the promised land of @entity61			0
in recent weeks , the eyes of the world have been on @entity64 , the @entity65 port where 1,300 @entity66 and @entity68 migrants have rioted as they battle for control of the best spot to jump on a lorry driving on to a ferry to the @entity18			1
yet over 15 years of mass illegal migration to @entity18 , other ports along the @entity65 and @entity6 north coasts have also become targets for migrants hoping to smuggle themselves to @entity61			1
they come from all over the world , and are mostly not @entity80 – like those who wait at @entity64 – but @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 and @entity87			1
at @entity1 , security fences have been put up , and containers are searched with body - heat - seeking devices , machines to detect human breath and sniffer dogs			1
fenced off : there are high security fences and containers are searched with devices that seek body heat hard to track : the ship on which the @entity82 @entity100 hid had 50 other containers on board , all bound for @entity32 ‘ this was a result of the growing numbers , ’ a port official told the @entity106 recently			1
‘ we had to do something to stop @entity1 becoming a target like @entity64			2
’ whether this has worked is another matter			0
the scale of the task is daunting			0
at one stage , the port authority admitted only one container in four could be searched because there are not enough staff			2
according to monitoring groups , during big waves of illegal migration 3,000 a year have slipped into containers on ferries and made it to @entity61 from @entity1			1
it is thought the number of those getting through is now around 600 a year – but the truth is that no one knows			2
@entity133 : in makeshift camps near the port , some migrants have waited for a year or more there are so many containers and so many ferries crossing the @entity22			1
the ship on which the @entity82 @entity100 hid had 50 other containers on board			2
most migrants arriving at the @entity6 coast live in decrepit makeshift camps hidden among trees dotted along the motorway from @entity65 while they wait their chance to get to @entity61			1
some have tents bought at the local supermarkets , but the majority exist in squalid improvised huts made from pieces of shed , black tarpaulin , sheets and blankets			0
i visited two camps on the @entity6 border near @entity1 yesterday morning			1
i talked to migrants as they cooked breakfast over open fires			1
i met a doctor , an engineer and an architect from @entity83 , two @entity168 students from the @entity170 @entity169 , and dozens of @entity82 who said they had not had a job in their home countries for years and were running away ‘ to your @entity61 ’			1
the migrants from different cultures and countries have little in common – except they all have family in @entity18 , want to get there desperately , and have been put in the ‘ holding ’ camps by agents who operate along the @entity6 and @entity65 coasts , and also smuggle them on to lorries for fat fees			1
the agents are controlled by mr @entity186 in cities such as @entity188 and @entity189 , such shadowy figures that even the agents do not know the names of their bosses			0
the agents set up the illicit journeys by mobile phone , and they , too , stay anonymous			0
they give only their first names or even pseudonyms to the migrants , so they can not be traced if police or border staff catch a stowaway at @entity1 or one of the other ports , such as @entity204			1
the @entity18 police say they are launching a homicide inquiry into the dead migrant , and hope to catch the traffickers who put him – and the other @entity100 – into the container			1
it will , by any standards , be a tough job			0
almost certainly , the @entity82 @entity100 will not even know the identity of the trafficking agents who fixed their journey , let alone the names of those who pull the strings at the top of the operation			1
there is one sliver of evidence : a cctv camera caught a picture of the lorry with the container entering the port on friday night			2
it is believed they were smuggled across the 4,000 miles from @entity82 to @entity230 by truck			2
once in @entity6 , they were put into an empty container , due to be shipped to the @entity18 , and driven by lorry into the port area and on to the ferry			1
whether they were forced to wait in a camp until the ‘ time was right ’ for the illicit journey is unclear as yet			0
certainly , the migrants i spoke to yesterday had not seen any @entity82 @entity100 during the past two or three weeks			1
ideal : some will pay another £ 1,500 to cross the @entity22 after already paying £ 20,000 for their journey so far increased security ' was a result of the growing numbers , ' a port official told the @entity106 recently			2
' we had to do something to stop @entity1 becoming a target like @entity64 ’ , the official added there are only 3,000 @entity168 families in @entity82			1
they have been oppressed by successive regimes for their religious beliefs			0
the @entity257 were particularly vicious , attacking and ostracising sikhs for their perceived wealth as successful merchants , and their refusal to convert to @entity262			0
no wonder this particular group has turned its eyes to @entity188 in the past decade , where there is a thriving and established @entity82 @entity168 community , particularly in @entity267 , @entity188			2
relatives in @entity188 raise the large sums of money demanded by the trafficking organisations , often – i have been told – paying the fees into trafficking agents ’ bank accounts in @entity61			0
the cost of a journey from @entity82 to the @entity6 coast is currently £ 20,000 a person , and then £ 1,500 per head to be taken across the @entity22			1
a well - used migrant route for @entity82 is to head for @entity282 by land and then travel over the porous border into @entity285 by boat , where they make their way to @entity288 and catch trains northwards to the @entity290			2
challenge : the road to @entity1 is a long one , and for many it begins with a tourist visa to @entity288 one migrant , 22 - year - old @entity170 @entity294 , said : ' i heard what had happened to the @entity100 from @entity82			1
it is terrible news for us , too			0
we are worried there will be more security on the container ships ' however , there is another migrant route which has become a favourite with those who have money			2
the illegals enter border - free @entity230 by plane on a tourist visa to @entity288 via @entity310			0
‘ a tourist visa into modern @entity230 means that you can go to any country apart from @entity61 without any trouble			0
@entity288 is full of tourists and gives the visas out easily , so it is a passport to @entity230 , ’ an immigration official in @entity312 told me recently			0
this was just the route taken by @entity323 , a 22 - year - old @entity170 @entity168 i found at a camp in @entity325 , a @entity65 town near the @entity6 border yesterday			2
he told me : ‘ i heard what had happened to the @entity100 from @entity82			2
it is terrible news for us , too			0
we are worried there will be more security on the container ships going out of the ports now			0
’ then , with his toothbrush and toothpaste in hand as he went for a morning wash at the corner of the camp , he added emotionally : ‘ i flew by @entity342 on a tourist visa from @entity344 to @entity310 , and then to @entity312			0
i got a train here to northern @entity65			0
i have been here a year and i am beginning to lose hope of getting to @entity61			1
’ at a camp nearer @entity1 , another @entity170 @entity168 , @entity348 , 22 , his long hair tucked into a baseball cap , said : ‘ i have relatives in @entity267 , in @entity352 and all over the north of @entity61			0
i have been here for two weeks waiting for the agent to find me a place on a container or a lorry			0
‘ i came into @entity288 on a tourist visa and caught a train from there			0
my visa into @entity288 meant i could come to @entity6 because there are n’t any borders in @entity230 any more , so it was easy			0
with sincerity shining from his dark eyes , he added : ‘ i do n’t want to be here , though , only @entity61			0
’ no doubt the 35 sikhs from @entity82 found at @entity32 in such a desperate state felt the same when they set off on their perilous journey			1
and what is clear from their troubling and tragic story is that they certainly wo n’t be the last to take their lives in their hands in the hope of making it to their destination .			0

35 @entity82 were crammed into container in huge port of @entity1 , @entity6
but migrants also come from @entity84 , @entity83 , @entity85 , @entity86 and @entity87
security fences have been put up and machines detect human breath
but still monitoring groups say around 600 a year make journey to @entity18
doctor , engineer , architect and students cooked breakfast over open fire
one said : ' i have been here a year and i am beginning to lose hope '
