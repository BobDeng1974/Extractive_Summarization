the newly released @entity0 is every bit as starry as the first film , with @entity3 , @entity4 , @entity5 and @entity6 at centre stage			1
but @entity8 plays its supporting role with equal charm and grace			1
painted elephants , marble palaces , magnificent forts , wandering cows , pale pink turbans and flickering candles tell of the noise , smells and rich colours of this flamboyant country			0
a city of colours and sounds : @entity24 is the spectacular setting for @entity0 filmed in @entity27 , the film is based in its capital , @entity24			1
but ask any resident of the city about the film and you will be met with a blank stare			1
our wonderful guide , @entity36 , was aware of it only because a client had pointed out ' the apparently very famous @entity3 ' in the @entity39			1
@entity40 , not @entity41 , still rules the screens here			0
while it might be too late to see @entity6 in the crowded alleyways of the bazaars , you will spot plenty of other desirable items			1
@entity24 is a shopper 's paradise and @entity8 flock here for silks and the region 's hand - made , block - printed cottons			1
this is also considered the place to come for jewels			0
the stones are not mined here , but cut , polished and set better than anywhere else			0
visit the iconic jeweller of @entity24 , the @entity60 , one - time court jewellers to the @entity63 emperors and run by the @entity65 family since 1852			2
classic glamour : @entity3 ( left ) stars in a movie which shows off @entity24 ( right ) at its most evocative here are ruby chandelier earrings , enamel rings with floral mughal designs and moonstone necklaces			1
you can watch them being worked on in their basement workshop , using skills that have been passed down the generations			0
for inexpensive sparkle , head to @entity81 ( @entity82 ) in the old city , where you can choose from a multitude of colourful lac bangles for a handful of rupees			2
made from resin produced by the female lac insect , they are embedded with mirror pieces , stones , beads or painted			0
for fashion , @entity95 is the most sophisticated venue , with high - collared men 's waistcoats and moccasins in all hues , as well as kaftans and shawls			2
the best block - printed fabrics , a craft that dates back to the 1700s , are at @entity106 , where cloth is piled from floor to ceiling			0
@entity119 , too , through the spice market , past paan wallahs filling betel leaves and the flower market , where scented roses , fragrant jasmine and marigolds are made into garlands to offer to your favourite deities			0
magical moments : " the @entity0 is every bit as starry as the first film " the @entity24 is so - called for its coloured wash , intended to replicate @entity8 sandstone , a more noble material than the lime and mortar of which the buildings are actually made			1
with its city gates and crenellated walls , it makes for a striking sight			0
there are iconic landmarks , such as the five - storey , 18th - century @entity136 , with its latticed screen facade allowing street life to be viewed by the veiled ladies within			0
before 1727 , when @entity140 created @entity24 , the @entity141 , neighbouring @entity142 , was the capital			2
the magnificent @entity144 , to which you can ride on an elephant , offers panoramic views over @entity148 and the ornamental gardens that seem to float within			0
the 16th and 17th century interiors impress with their exquisitely carved silver doors , ceilings of alabaster and an @entity8 version of the @entity155 with mirrored fragments embedded in vaulted ceilings glinting between arches			2
today , the @entity24 royal family live in the @entity160 , where rooms are open to the public			2
gone is their @entity39 , which became @entity8 's first palace hotel in 1957 ( do try its @entity167 restaurant )			1
but their newly elegant @entity168 has recently been re-opened			0
dating back to 1729 , this was once the @entity171 residency and later home to the polo - playing @entity173 , who entertained the @entity174 , @entity175 , prince @entity176 and princess @entity177 , and @entity178			0
a vision in pink : the @entity136 is one of @entity24 's - and @entity27 's - most iconic structures their names adorn some of the 14 suites in the palace 's new chapter as a hotel managed by @entity188			1
the decor , by acclaimed designer @entity189 , offers vivid turquoises and shocking pinks , gilded mirrors and sweeping marble staircases - but , sadly , not @entity6			2
@entity195 ( 01242 851 868 , www.abercrombiekent.co.uk ) offers three nights ' b&b in @entity24 at the @entity168 with city tour , trip to the @entity144 , transfers and flights via @entity202 with @entity203 from Â£ 1,775 per person , based on two sharing a double room .			1

the city is one of the most alluring *destinations* in @entity8 's @entity27
