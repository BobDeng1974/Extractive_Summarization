by @entity1 reporter published : 10:52 est , 10 july 2012 updated : 10:52 est , 10 july 2012 a five - year - old boy has taken his first steps - after a ' miracle ' drug helped shrink a giant and deadly tumour that was raging through his body			1
@entity8 has a growth spanning his entire right leg , pelvic area , bowel , part of his stomach and lower spine			2
it is so big that surgeons are unable to remove it , and until recently he could only get about in a wheelchair			2
but after taking an experimental drug to treat the incurable condition - which is through to affect just 500 people worldwide - @entity23 has been given a new lease of life and last month he took his first steps			1
new start : @entity8 is now walking after an experimental drug stopped a tumour from growing in his body			1
he was diagnosed with a rare lymphatic disease at @entity32 in 2010 ( right ) his mother @entity33 , 39 , from @entity34 , said : ' it ’s amazing			2
the difference was almost overnight			2
' he went from being a child who spent most of his time on the sofa because he was in so much pain , to a very happy little boy who loves being in the thick of it			1
' he wants to play football , wrestle , bounce on the trampoline , and climb trees			2
he sometimes forgets he ’s not able to do all these things but he still wants to give it a go			2
' @entity23 was diagnosed with @entity51 , a rare and invasive disease caused by a malformation of the lymphatic system , when he was just 18 months old			1
it has also left him with brittle bones and his blood does not clot properly , which causes internal bleeding			2
but against all odds , @entity23 ’s condition has seen a marked improvement since he started taking trial drug sirolimus			1
he no longer has to visit the hospital every week			2
the drug is more commonly used as an anti-rejection drug for kidney transplant patients , last september			1
mrs @entity67 , who also has son @entity68 , nine , said : ' as far as we are concerned it ’ s a miracle drug			1
i ca n’t believe how happy and healthy @entity23 is today			1
' he is getting stronger every day			2
' we ’ve been able to wean him off all his pain relief , an mri scan showed the tumour has reduced in size and it has n’t spread			1
' it was spreading really quickly and was going up into @entity23 ’s spine but it has n’t gone any further			1
that in itself is fantastic			2
' the ultimate goal is to find a cure but this is a breakthrough			2
' @entity23 's mother @entity33 ( pictured ) said : ' this drug is giving @entity23 the quality of life he should have ' @entity23 was just six months old , when mrs @entity67 and her husband @entity92 , 43 , noticed his leg appeared swollen when he was in his baby walker			1
he was eventually diagnosed a year later at @entity32			0
@entity23 ’s right leg remains swollen and is around three times larger than the left one			1
the disease is also making his right leg grow at a faster rate and it is 5cm longer			0
however @entity23 , who until recently had to take morphine to combat the pain he was in , has a special shoe with a built - up sole to aid his balance			1
mrs @entity67 said : ' we ’ve got him pain free and balanced and he has been able to take his first steps unaided			1
' it was very emotional			0
he just stood up and said : ‘ @entity111 , look at me ’ , and took three steps			0
' he even made me keep it a secret from his dad because he wanted to practice before he showed him			0
my husband shed a few tears when he saw him walking			0
' along with the trial drug , @entity23 also takes potent cancer drugs once every seven weeks and steroids twice a day to help his blood clot			1
it is hoped his next session of chemotherapy next month will be his last and that in time he will also be able to come off the steroids			0
@entity127 , at nine months old , before he was diagnosed			0
his parents were concerned that one of his legs appeared swollen mrs @entity67 now hopes @entity23 , who was five last month , will be able to walk into school , when he starts there after the summer holidays			1
she said : ' it ’s a major milestone			0
we did n’t really think he would get to mainstream school or even get to school			0
“ i ’m just so happy he is joining in and doing what he ’s supposed to at five years of age			0
' he ’s a cheeky little character who is always laughing and playing with his brother and asking to have friends around			0
it ’s fantastic he can just be a little boy			0
' however , they know there is no guarantee that the drug ’s success will continue indefinitely			1
the family has now set up a charity in their son ’s name to help raise money for @entity156 and @entity157			0
the organisation aims to fund research for a much - needed cure for the disease , which has a low life expectancy , with only some sufferers surviving 10 years or more			0
mrs @entity67 said : ' this drug is giving @entity23 the quality of life he should have and we ’ve got to hold on to that			1
' as long as his body can tolerate the toxins the drug produces he should be able to stay on it , hopefully , for the rest of his life			1
' but they do n’t know what side affects there could be			0
we just have to take it one day at a time			0
' something like this teaches you not to look too far into the future			0
we just have to live for today			0
' since setting up @entity185 at the end of last year , they have raised more than £ 40,000			0

drug has stopped spread of tumour and @entity23 has been weaned off pain *medication*
the drug is more commonly used as an anti-rejection drug for kidney transplant patients
