when the makers of the @entity19 - based six part comedy tv series for @entity20 posted that @entity0 had taken the clip off their page , fans commented that it was ' outrageous ' and ' ridiculous '			1
so i 'm just going to think about all the ridiculous half naked , tacky lingerie - clad girls posting selfies that @entity0 is apparently okay with and laugh			2
' @entity37 called it a : ' typical misapplication of standards			2
' the show 's co-creator @entity41 told the @entity44 : ' i 've moved from anger to disappointment to just bewilderment , really , ' @entity41 said			0
' i just think it 's silly and disrespectful to the women who were dancing for us			2
' out of all the reasons we could have been pulled , nudity is not high on the list			0
' on 12 april , @entity41 reposted the video on the @entity11 facebook page			1

aboriginal actress @entity72 , who co-created the comedy show about a radio station in constant plight ' where black and white mingle ' , told @entity76 : ' i just do n't understand how mothers breastfeeding or dancing ceremonially [ can be ] offensive			1
' the 2.36 minute long clip also shows a white man accidentally shooting an aboriginal man with a dart while hunting and the white @entity85 who have come to work at the radio station in @entity19 are labelled ' @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity89 '			1
' @entity19 - based @entity4 radio station @entity11 has been infiltrated by … well - meaning whitefellas who will save your soul , steal your assets and usurp your culture , all in the name of helping you out , ' the blurb for the comedy show reads			1
aboriginal actress @entity72 , who co-created the comedy show about a radio station in constant plight , was also confused about how women ' dancing ceremonially can be offensive ' characters in the @entity12 show @entity107 ( @entity108 ) and @entity109 ( @entity110 ) are seen during filming ' saving @entity114 people from themselves is hard work , but ' closing the @entity116 ' has never been funnier , ' it adds			1

the nudity section of @entity0 ’s community standards says : ‘ we restrict the display of nudity because some audiences within our global community may be sensitive to this type of content – particularly because of their cultural background or age			2
the comedy is about an @entity19 - based @entity4 radio station @entity11 where black and ' whitefella ' work the 2.36 minute long clip also shows a white man accidentally shooting an aboriginal man with a dart while hunting ' @entity4 people from themselves is hard work , but ' closing the @entity116 ' has never been funnier , ' the comedy show 's blurb reads ' in order to treat people fairly and respond to reports quickly , it is essential that we have policies in place that our global teams can apply uniformly and easily when reviewing content			1
as a result , our policies can sometimes be more blunt than we would like and restrict content shared for legitimate purposes			0
we are always working to get better at evaluating this content and enforcing our standards			0
’ @entity0 explains : ‘ we remove photographs of people displaying genitals or focusing in on fully exposed buttocks			2
