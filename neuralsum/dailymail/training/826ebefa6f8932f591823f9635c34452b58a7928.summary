by @entity0 published : 06:23 est , 30 may 2012 updated : 19:26 est , 30 may 2012 he had a hand in some of the ‘ most heinous and brutal crimes in human history ’ during an 11 - year war in @entity6			1
and yesterday @entity7 , the former president of @entity8 , received his punishment as he was jailed for the rest of his life by a war crimes judge			1
he is likely to serve his sentence in @entity14 following a pledge by the @entity17 government in 2006			1
scroll down to watch the sentencing jailed : @entity8 ex-president @entity7 looks downbeat as his sentence is read out today killer : @entity7 , pictured here in his heyday , was told his crimes were of the ' utmost gravity ' @entity24 , the judge at the un-backed court in @entity26 , said @entity7 was in a ‘ class of his own ’ when it came to war crimes and sentenced him to 50 years			1
@entity7 , 64 , had provided arms and support to the brutal @entity34 rebels in neighbouring @entity35 – in return for a steady supply of ‘ blood diamonds ’			1
‘ while mr @entity7 never set foot in @entity35 , his heavy footprint is there , ’ the judge said			1
the rebels ’ atrocities included cutting off the limbs of their victims and cutting open pregnant women to settle bets on the sex of their unborn children , he said			0
@entity7 immediately lodged an appeal which means he will remain in the @entity50 for now			0
it will cost at least £ 100,000 a year to keep him in jail here			2
@entity17 boasted that its 2006 offer of a cell was proof of a commitment to international justice			0
during @entity7 ’s trial , model @entity59 ’s evidence provided a key link between @entity7 and the diamonds he received in return for arms			1
first : @entity7 is the first former head of state convicted by a war crimes court since @entity67 warlord : as president of @entity8 from 1997 - 2003 , @entity7 was accused of war crimes including the employment of child soldiers , rape and murder in the brutal war against neighbouring @entity35 @entity7 is the first former head of state convicted by an international war crimes court since @entity67 and judges said they had no precedent when deciding his sentence			1
he looks likely to serve his sentence in a @entity14 jail after @entity83 's government in 2006 made the offer to resolve a stand - off that had delayed @entity7 's two - year trial			1
he said : ' the special status of mr @entity7 as a head of state puts him in a different category of offenders for the purpose of sentencing			0
' at a sentencing hearing earlier this month , @entity7 expressed ' deepest sympathy ' for the suffering of victims of atrocities in @entity35			2
but he insisted he had acted to help stabilise the @entity6 region and claimed he never knowingly assisted in the commission of crimes			0
he said : ' what i did ... was done with honour			0
i was convinced that unless there was peace in @entity35 , @entity8 would not be able to move forward			1
' @entity34 soldiers , backed by @entity7 , pictured riding in a pick - up truck at their base in the outskirts of @entity111 @entity112 ( left ) and @entity113 ( right ) both had limbs hacked off by the @entity34 a child soldier of the ex-president 's militia in @entity35			1
however , judges ruled that @entity7 armed and supplied the rebels in full knowledge they would likely use weapons to commit terrible crimes			0
this was in exchange for payments of ' blood diamonds ' often obtained by slave labour			1
prosecutors said there was no reason for leniency , given the extreme nature of the crimes , @entity7 's ' greed ' and misuse of his position of power			0
prosecutor @entity138 wrote in a brief : ' the purposely cruel and savage crimes committed included public executions and amputations of civilians			0
' the display of decapitated heads at checkpoints , the killing and public disembowelment of a civilian whose intestines were then stretched across the road to make a check point			0
' public rapes of women and girls , and people burned alive in their homes			0
' soldiers backed by @entity7 wreaked havoc in @entity35 so he could obtain blood diamonds @entity7 armed child soldiers who rampaged through @entity35 @entity7 stepped down and fled into exile in @entity164 after being indicted by the court in 2003			1
he was finally arrested and sent to the @entity50 in 2006			0
while the @entity35 court is based in that country 's capital , @entity111 , @entity7 's trial is being staged in @entity170 , a suburb of @entity26 , for fear holding it in @entity6 could destabilise the region			2
one of @entity7 's sons is in jail for torture , another is awaiting trial for murder and two more children were fathered while he was in @entity50 custody			0
more than 120,000 people were killed and two million displaced in @entity35 ’s civil war which was characterised by atrocities , the use of enslaved child soldiers and the amputation of children ’s limbs as a weapon of terror			2
claims : @entity59 ( right ) allegedly accepted a ' blood diamond ' from the former @entity195 despot			0
she said she was given it by unknown men			0
@entity198 ( centre ) contradicted this , as did @entity59 's former agent @entity201 ( left ) who said @entity59 knew @entity7 sent two men to her room to give her the precious stones @entity14 played a vital role in ending the war after @entity83 sent in 800 troops in may 2000 to evacuate foreign nationals and support @entity35 ’s fledgling democracy			1
the @entity14 troops also assisted in capturing rebel leader , @entity212 , and helped to form a military strategy which forced the @entity34 to retreat from the capital , @entity111 , a former crown colony			2
pivotal to the case was the evidence of supermodel @entity59 and actress @entity198 , who provided a clear link between @entity7 and blood diamonds he received in payment for arms			1
@entity223 - born miss @entity59 admitted being given a pouch of uncut gems by the president ’s men after a dinner in @entity229			2
@entity7 is thought to have acquired from the rebels diamonds worth as much as £ 950million			2
