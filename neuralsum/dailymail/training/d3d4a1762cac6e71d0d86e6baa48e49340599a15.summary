hit tv show @entity0 has been lambasted by linguistic experts for its dodgy use of @entity5 accents			1
set in a world which could be described as half medieval , half @entity9 , the award - wining fanatsy series has won a worldwide audience with its lavish production values			0
the show 's cast consists of predominantly @entity5 actors including well known faces like @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 as well as newcomers @entity20 , @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24			1
@entity18 ( left ) and @entity17 ( right ) are among the many @entity5 actors to feature in @entity27 's hit fantasy series @entity0 , but the show has been lambasted by linguistic experts for its dodgy accents and while the hotchpotch of regional accents on offer appear to have fallen on deaf ears in the @entity36 they have begun to attract ridicule in the @entity38			1
in one terrible blunder four members of the same family - the @entity41 - are all heard speaking with different accents			1
producers on the show , which is set in an ancient kingdom based on early @entity47 , have hired a growing army of famous and forgotten @entity38 acting talent			2
each episode enjoys a mammoth budget , similar to that of a @entity54 movie , but experts said they should have paid more attention to our diverse accents			0
the show 's creators splashed out on constructing new languages called @entity62 and @entity63 for the exotic @entity65 kingdoms , but have let the @entity5 accents run wild			1
professor @entity68 , @entity69 and language expert said the mistakes are caused because @entity36 do n't know any better			1
brits @entity20 ( as @entity73 ) and @entity24 ( as @entity74 ) both speak with southern accents in the show he said : ' the accents on @entity0 are a complete mish - mash and it is the one big mistake they 've made			2
' some actors are better at accents than others and it really shows on the show			2
' they should have had a dialect coach on set to ensure all the accents were consistent - but the actors must have been told to ' sound as @entity5 as you can , just not @entity36			1
' ' when these actors audition for a role , they must show their ability to perform with a range of accents			2
' the @entity36 producers can not hear the inconsistencies on the show 's @entity5 accents as they tend to be wowed by @entity5 accents , no matter where they come from			1
' most of them have n't had much exposure to @entity5 brogues outside of the standard @entity109 or @entity110 accents			2
' they ca n't distinguish between people 's speech from @entity114 , @entity115 and @entity116 - those accents will all sound the same to them			0
the show is set in a fantasy world which could be described as half medieval , half @entity9 more @entity5 : @entity120 as @entity121 and @entity23 are among the many young @entity5 actors in the series ' the producers thought we 'll get @entity5 actors and have lovely @entity5 accents , but they got a lot more than they bargained for			1
' they have spent a lot of money on constructing the new @entity62 and @entity132 languages and no doubt the regional accents have come second to this			0
' as long as it sounds exotic to them , the producers will be happy			0
' it would be impossible for members of the same family , like the @entity41 , to have different accents unless one had been sent to live the other side of the country			0
' it 's more like a representation of life today where people travel and have partners from elsewhere			0
' dr @entity150 , senior lecturer in @entity151 at @entity152 added : ' tv producers use regional accents as a shorthand for creating characters			0
' stereotypes born out of accents are a method of giving the audience a quick way to indentify their backgrounds - but they 're out of place in this context			0
' a @entity27 spokesman for @entity0 said the producers of the show ' declined to comment			0
' it is n't the first time an @entity36 production has been slammed for its misunderstanding of @entity5 accents			1
after starring in the 2010 production of @entity175 , @entity54 hot head @entity176 famously stormed out of an interview with @entity178 after being accused of making the hero of @entity180 sound a trifle @entity182 .			0

show 's cast consists of predominantly of actors from all over @entity38
in one blunder four members of the same family speak with different accents
