by @entity0 published : 11:53 est , 9 july 2013 updated : 12:35 est , 9 july 2013 fans of the women 's surf - wear brand @entity4 have expressed their outrage at a new teaser video they feel is demeaning to women , branding it as ' disrespectful ' and ' disappointing ' , and some claiming they feel ' utterly disgusted '			1
posted on the brand 's @entity10 channel and @entity13 page , the short video features a faceless female surfer waking up in the morning and preparing to hit the waves ... but the star of the show is her bottom			1
moreover , since the video ends when she paddles out to sea , none of the video actually features any surfing , which fans have found unpalatable			1

' she has so many dimensions we do n't even have to show you her face ( just her bum , ammirite ? ? ! ) so original , i feel i have learnt so much about this woman 's " complexity "			2
' ' sarcasm over now			2
it 's hard enough getting coverage for women 's sport , and now there is this fantastic opportunity to showcase this competition and the ability of the surfers - and it has been wasted			2
' sitting on your bed in your undies and sexily undressing for a shower is in no way a " dimension "			2

she 's a pro surfer that is what their figure looks like			2
but i am bothered you " promote " a world tour surfing event focusing entirely around a woman 's butt			0
' aimed at who ? ! not women that 's for sure			0
it should n't be focused on a surfer 's body or sex at all , it should be about their talent and athleticism and power			0
amazed @entity102 still let sponsors do this in 2013			1
it would n't happen at @entity106			0

it only got my attention by disappointing me by reducing women , yet again , to their sexuality			1
' the video shows the faceless girl getting up in the morning and preparing to hit the waves ...			1
but she never actually rides one @entity119 said : ' utterly disgusted that a brand which promotes natural beauty with vast female base clients focus so much on sexualising a female athlete 's body when promoting a world surfing event			1
' not a single shot of surfing was displayed on the ad and yet it was meant to promote surfing talents ! i was a big @entity4 fan until i see the response you have provided			0
' we know she is sexy ; we know she has an amazing body ; but do you have no other selling points to attract interest to @entity43 ? pathetic really			1
' others tried to defend the brand , claiming male surfers suffer the same fate in the industry - and that at least the video drew attention to the surf competition others tried to defend the brand , claiming male surfers suffer the same fate in the industry - and that at least the video drew attention to the surf competition			1
@entity155 said : ' i would just like to point out , that male surfers are shirtless and have their butts showing through their board shorts all the time during contests , and somehow that 's not sexist ? ' as a very proud surfer girl , i do wish the video had an ounce of surfing in it ( come on @entity4 ) but the video got everyone 's attention			1
' it may have been for the wrong reasons , but it got attention			0
with that i bet many more people will be watching the contest than before			0
and to say that the company that made the first women 's board shorts is sexist and is setting us back , in my opinion , is just stupid			0
' the surfer paddles out to sea , but the video ends before she gets to a wave @entity4 were unavailable for direct comment , but wrote on their @entity13 page : ' whether you are athletic , smart , funny , sexy , daring , confident - we support whatever combination you choose to be			1
' women are complex and multidimensional			0
to ignore this fact is to ignore who we truly are			0
' obviously , there 's been much conversation around the video we recently released			1
we believe all athletes are naturally beautiful , in and out of the water			0
' you certainly do n't have to be sexy to be an athlete , and we also believe it 's not wrong to be an athlete and to be sexy , if you choose to be			0
' we do n't judge one to be better than the other and we do n't believe in excluding one for the other			0
thank you for the passionate thoughts shared on the video , and for expressing how much you respect women in surfing			2
