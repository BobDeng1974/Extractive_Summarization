published : 16:02 est , 19 september 2012 updated : 16:04 est , 19 september 2012 a high - end steakhouse in the @entity1 is offering @entity3 restaurant goers their first real taste of a @entity7 steak , for a whopping $ 350			1
while restaurants across @entity10 have claimed to sell @entity7 beef on their upscale menus for years , charging customers hundreds of dollars for the delicacy , these steaks have previously been fakes			1
until august 17 , 2012 , it has been illegal to buy , sell , and import any @entity19 beef in the @entity10 , including the rare @entity20 ; and while some ranchers in the @entity22 have claimed to recreate it , they only produce what @entity24 has called ' faux - be ' beef - a cut of meat that is all beef , but no @entity7			1
the real deal : the @entity30 in the @entity1 is offering @entity3 restaurant goers their first real taste of a @entity7 steak , for a whopping $ 350 last month the @entity33 lifted the ban on the import , which was originally set in place because of an outbreak of foot and mouth disease in @entity19 , and now the brand new steak dish at @entity41 is so popular that the restaurant does n't even have it on the menu			1
owner @entity45 told @entity46 : ' we got our first shipment on friday , and already it has sold out			0
' the availability is so limited , so we 're keeping it to a first come , first serve basis of reservations only , ' he said			0
during the import ban , restaurants have been charging approximately $ 40 for a ' @entity7 ' burger or $ 100 for a ' @entity7 ' steak , conning customers into paying top dollar by using a word synonymous with excellence and good quality meat			1
' we got our first shipment on friday , and already it has sold out ' however @entity63 's @entity7 steak is the real deal			2
' we had two people fly in from @entity19 's @entity66 to see the meat , to ensure it have arrived properly , and was being served correctly , ' mr @entity45 explained			2
kobe beef in @entity19 is a registered trademark of the @entity71 , and must fulfill seven strict conditions in order for a restaurant or supplier to label it as such			2
patented and pricey : @entity7 beef on sale at a price of $ 180 per kilo in @entity19 , it is known for its renowned flavour , tenderness , and fatty , well - marbled texture the virtues of @entity7 , which refers to cuts of beef from the @entity88 - ushi breed of @entity90 cattle , considered a delicacy and renowned for its flavour and tenderness , has been regularly touted by famous chefs and on menus all over the country			1
while @entity90 is a broad term which literally means @entity19 cattle , @entity20 is the term which is used for beef actually raised in the province of @entity7			1
under @entity19 law , for a beef to be labelled @entity7 , it can only came from the @entity106 prefecture , where no slaughterhouses were approved for export from 2010 until august 2012 by the @entity33			1
and despite the fact that @entity20 , @entity111 , and cattle are patented trademarks in @entity19 , these @entity19 trademarks are neither recognised nor protected by @entity10 law			1
similar to the label ' natural ' on many @entity10 products , a term also unregulated in @entity10 , @entity20 is an adjective which has been used by restaurants mainly to confuse consumers and profit from their confusion			2
however real @entity7 beef is produced under some of the world ’s strictest legal food standards , contributing to the $ 350 cost of the @entity63 's authentic @entity7 steak			1
copyright guidelines : these authentic @entity7 cows were born in the @entity106 prefecture , raised on local grasses since its birth , and have a 10 digit @entity133 ' i can only equate it with having a great bottle of wine			0
you would pay $ 300 to taste the best possible red , much like you would for the best steak in the world , ' said mr @entity45			0
he added : ' buying @entity19 beef is about ten to 15 times the cost of buying @entity10 beef , and that 's where most of our overheads come in			1
but it 's not about the money , it 's just about enabling the public to try this exquisite piece for meat			0
' according to the @entity7 patent , in order to label a cut of meat @entity7 , it must have come from a pure lineage of @entity160 breed cattle			0
however in the @entity10 , @entity19 cattle which were imported before the 2010 ban are crossbred with @entity10 cattle , which has translated into a @entity7 - style product			1
must be pure - bred @entity88 calf born in @entity106 farm fed only from grains and water from @entity106 castrated bull or virgin cow , to purify the beef processed at slaughterhouses in @entity7 , @entity173 , @entity174 , @entity175 and @entity176 in @entity106 only marbling ratio , called @entity178 , of level 6 and above @entity179 of 4 or 5 gross weight of beef from one animal is 470kg or less the cow must also have been born in the @entity106 prefecture , raised on local grasses , water and soil since its birth			0
it must be a bull or virgin cow , and it must be processed in a @entity106 slaughterhouse , which for two years have not been able to be exported to the @entity10 , until now			0
there are only 3000 head of certified @entity20 cattle in the world , and each of them live in @entity19			0
the process is so strict that when the beef is sold , either in stores or restaurants , it must carry the 10 - digit identification number so customers know what particular @entity205 it came from			0
but as an unregulated term , the @entity10 government has enabled vendors to misuse the @entity7 name , charging customers high prices under false pretenses			2
however with the ban now lifted , hopefully this will change			0
and while the @entity10 @entity20 - style beef is usually raised all - natural , antibiotic - free , hormone - free , and fed a vegetarian diet , it has nothing in common with actual @entity7 beef except that it comes from cows			1
restaurants currently have no legal obligation to label it as such , easily justifying a price tag to match the wool pulled over consumers eyes			0
mr @entity45 , who is excited about being one of the first @entity10 restaurants to serve the real deal , said : ' we 'll continue to serve it as long as the demand is there			2
' it ’s a food experience of orgasmic proportions – really , ' he added			0
diners who order the pricey dish will also be able to take home an inscribed plate as a token of their experience .			0

@entity30 is one of the first restaurants in @entity10 to sell real @entity7 beef
the @entity33 lifted a *longstanding* @entity19 meat import ban on august 17 , 2012
