i think the man on the door had had a rough night			0
i said , ' trust me , i 'm a vicar ' and i was wearing the dog collar – but he would n't budge			2
' the bemused grandad , a massive @entity25 and @entity26 fan , grinned : ' it 's their loss			1
' i was n't going to go in and tell everyone to go to hell or anything ! ' mr @entity0 , who preached in @entity32 for 16 years , strolled off instead to the nearby @entity33 in the @entity34 for a quick drink and a chat			1
' i have been in @entity10 before and it 's a lovely place - it 's a bit of a giggle really and occasionally this sort of thing happens			0
