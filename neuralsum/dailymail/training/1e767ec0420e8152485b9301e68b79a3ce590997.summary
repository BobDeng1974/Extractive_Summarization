the @entity0 has come under fire after it refused to condemn @entity2 - because of fears it was ' islamophobic '			1
students put forward a motion at the body 's @entity8 meeting calling for the condemnation of terrorist atrocities and support for the @entity14 people			1
but the call was defeated after a rebellion led by @entity18 officer @entity17 , who said the motion was merely a ' justification for war '			1
fighters from @entity2 are pictured marching in @entity27 , @entity28 it comes a day after military chiefs from around the globe met to discuss the battle against @entity2 and despite a number of @entity36 leaders in @entity33 having condemned the extremist group			0
one student , who wished to remain anonymous , said : ' @entity39 is a meaningless term used by irrational people when unable to rebut a rational criticism			2
' @entity17 should realise how lucky she is to be able to stand up and express her opinions with freedom and security			0
' she would not enjoy the same freedom if she were to visit the @entity2 / @entity2 that she refuses to condemn , and protested her opinions			0
' another added : ' i personally would find something rather islamophobic in ms @entity17 's idea that condemning @entity2 is also to condemn the other , approximately two billion @entity36 on the planet - who do n't rape minorities or murder journalists			1
' they do n't want @entity2 to carry out such attacks in the name of their religion , and who in the @entity59 have repeatedly begged not to be associated with the activities of " @entity63 " state			0
' if the vast majority of @entity36 students in the @entity33 are in fact repeatedly standing up and telling you that they do n't like @entity2 , that these terrorists do n't represent their faith , that they do n't want to be associated with them in any way - then how exactly is not condemning @entity2 helping to fight @entity39 ? ' the motion , proposed by @entity73 , was raised at the @entity0 ' @entity8 meeting at @entity75 in @entity76 in september			1
it put forward seven suggestions as to how the body could support the ongoing battle with the @entity81			1
the motion stated : ' to work with the @entity84 â€™ campaign to support @entity14 , @entity28 and other international students in the @entity33 affected by this situation			1
' to campaign in solidarity with the @entity14 people and in particular support the hard - pressed student , workers ' and women 's organisations against all the competing nationalist and religious - right forces			1
the @entity0 ( @entity0 ) has come under fire after it refused to condemn @entity2 - because of fears it was ' islamophobic '			1
the @entity0 headquarters in @entity76 is pictured above ' to support @entity14 trying to bridge the @entity101 divide to fight for equality and democracy , including defence of the rights of the @entity107 and @entity108 minorities			1
' to condemn the @entity109 and support the @entity111 forces fighting against it , while expressing no confidence or trust in the @entity115 military intervention			0
' encourage students to boycott anyone found to be funding the is or supplying them with goods , training , travel or soldiers			0
' to make contact with @entity14 and @entity111 organisations , in @entity14 and in the @entity33 , in order to build solidarity and to support refugees			2
and to issue a statement on the above basis			0
' but @entity129 student @entity17 led a team who either abstained or voted against the proposal , leading to the motion 's defeat			2
she said : ' we recognise that condemnation of @entity2 appears to have become a justification for war and blatant @entity39			1
' this rhetoric exacerbates the issue at hand and in essence is a further attack on those we aim to defend			0
' the @entity145 stands in support of black communities across the globe and uncompromisingly against imperialism and @entity151 interference which history shows all too often leads to the suffering of black people			0
' we stand in complete solidarity with the @entity111 people against the recent attacks by @entity2 and join many others in condemnation of their brutal actions			2
' the @entity145 will be working with @entity111 students and the @entity162 to raise this issue within the @entity0			0
' she added that she will now begin work on a revised motion which will not be ' islamophobic '			1
but @entity73 , who proposed the motion , said he could not see any signs of @entity39			1
he said : ' i have looked again and again at the contents of the motion , yet i can not track any @entity39 or racism			2
' there is a stranglehold of " identity politics " on the student movement			0
' this is an issue which needs to be discussed in more depth , but essentially the idea is widespread that if a liberation officer opposes something , it must be bad			0
' earlier this year @entity36 leaders in @entity33 condemned @entity2 expressing their ' grave concern ' at continued violence in its name			0
representatives from both the @entity101 and @entity188 groups in the @entity33 relayed their message that the militant group does not represent the majority of @entity36			0
@entity192 , of the @entity193 , said at the time : ' violence has no place in religion , violence has no religion			0
' as international condemnation of the extremists continued to grow this week , @entity115 president @entity198 met with representatives from a global coalition of 22 countries to discuss the battle against @entity2			2
representatives from @entity206 , @entity207 , @entity208 , @entity209 , @entity14 and @entity210 were among those who attended the meeting			2
in a statement , the @entity0 said : ' at our most recent @entity8 meeting , a motion on this issue was presented and voted on by all members			1
' some committee members felt that the wording of the motion being presented would unfairly demonise all @entity36 rather than solely the group of people it set out to rightfully condemn			0
' @entity0 does not support @entity2 and a new motion will be taken to the next @entity226 meeting , which will specifically condemn the politics and methods of @entity2 and offer solidarity for the @entity111 people			1
