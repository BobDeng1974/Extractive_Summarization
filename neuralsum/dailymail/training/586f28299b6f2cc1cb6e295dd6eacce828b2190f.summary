madame @entity0 rose to fame as the matriarch of @entity4 ' @entity3 by marrying businessman @entity5 - in a lion 's cage - in 1928			1
today , at 103 , she has outlived her late husband by decades but still has a smile on her face as she reminisces over her extraordinary life			1
@entity0 appears at the circus apartment doorway in @entity4 in sparkling diamonds , red lipstick and a walking frame and sits down beside her leopard skin rug			1
@entity17 , 103 , ( pictured last month ) shows an art piece depicting her and her husband during their circus days as she sits in her @entity4 apartment art piece depicts @entity17 's wedding day in a lion cage in 1928 , on display in her @entity4 apartment ' that 's @entity28 , ' exclaims the doyenne of @entity31 's most famous circus , pointing to all that remains of her former pet			1
' he died of old age			1
we had him a long time , ' she says nostalgically , while offering a visitor one of her luxury @entity41 chocolates			1
soon , anecdotes from the legend come pouring out : how she got married in a lion 's den , once entered a posh hotel carrying a baby primate in a hat box , and helped raise a parrot known for its foul use of the @entity51 language			1
the great @entity52 is now considered the big top 's most eccentric , and oldest , character			1
@entity55 been to a performing family in @entity57 just in time for @entity58 in 1910 , two years before the @entity59 sank , she went on to find fame and success in @entity4 by marrying @entity5 , whose claim to fame was buying the @entity64 in 1934			2
she 's now a @entity51 celebrity in her own right			2
photographs and paintings seen displayed in @entity17 's apartment in @entity4			2
madame @entity0 was born in @entity57 to a performing family in time for @entity58 in 1910 she was close friends with @entity71 , the @entity72 - born @entity51 dancer , singer and actress			1
madame @entity0 also rubbed shoulders with opera diva @entity76 and actresses @entity77 and @entity79 — and outlived them all			1
madame @entity0 , who now has 54 grandchildren and great grandchildren , survived two world wars and the @entity84 occupation			1
but the matriarch of the @entity64 never let the petty trials of the 20th century spoil her zest for life			2
she married her husband in a lions ' cage instead of a church			2
she remembers advising the pastor against entering the den for fear he 'd get eaten by the big cats and not finish the service			2
her protective elephant respected the sanctity of this marriage so much that he once squashed @entity76 in retribution for getting too close to her husband after one show			2
@entity17 points to photographs around her @entity4 apartment as she talks about her life ' the elephant practically knocked her over			2
... he was jealous , ' said @entity0 , with a laugh that makes her look decades younger			1
laughter , it becomes apparent , is this incredible woman 's life - line : the memories and anecdotes she 's told a thousand times still make her wrinkled face light up with a touching naivety when she remembers a punchline or conjures up an image that had been sitting for years undusted in her memory archive			2
nevertheless , she feels the need to bring along to the interview her 80 - year - old son @entity125 as her ' memory aid ' to help her fill in the gaps			2
once she gets started , the stories pour out			0
there was her other ' child ' — a male gorilla she somehow named @entity131			0
she and her husband once turned up at a top hotel with the baby primate placed in the hat box			0
the footman said , ' gosh			0
@entity0 's hats are pretty heavy , ' said @entity0 , chuckling and saying that for the month they were at the hotel no one noticed the gorilla in the room			1
@entity131 also had a taste for wine			0
the couple 's foul - mouthed parrot , @entity146 , was equally loved , but less jovial			0
he lived to 45 and would squawk profanities at @entity148 , if he was ever ignored			0
' i can not tell you what he would call me ... ( @entity152 ) are very , very intelligent			0
he could speak very fluently , ' she said			0
her stories are fantastical , but photos , pictures and her son bear witness			0
take for instance her sea voyage to @entity161 with her circus in the 50 's			0
in scenes reminiscent of ' @entity164 , ' she says there was a freak storm , which caused the captain to order that the 12 elephants be thrown overboard to save the ship from sinking			0
an art piece depicts @entity52 and her husband during their circus days @entity17 , 103 , sits with her son @entity125 in her apartment in @entity4 her son , who was aboard , calls it a ' miracle ' when suddenly the storm subsided and the boat remained afloat with the animals safe			1
' that was an adventure , ' says madame @entity0			1
then there were the celebrities			0
' so many , so many , ' says her son , who remembers sitting with stars @entity77 and @entity79 who had flown in from @entity185 to attend the circus perform beneath the @entity187			0
madame @entity0 met @entity76 , who loved the circus , many times , and had a close relationship with @entity71 , who died in 1975			1
' she was a friend			0
amazing , ' @entity0 says , adding that she used to share costume ideas with the black icon that went on to become a global star for her ground - breaking banana dance			1
there 's a slight sadness when she reminisces over characters in her old stories			0
' they 're all dead			0
... they 're all dead , ' @entity0 repeats several times , sighing in front of the portrait of her husband , who died decades ago			1
but now that her huge family includes contortionists , acrobats , jugglers , and lion tamers in the popular annual @entity64 spectacle , their many theatrical get - togethers stop her dwelling on the past			0
she says the secrets of her eternal youth include hard work , sleeping very little and deadly animals			1
' i 've always , always been with lions , with panthers , with wolves , with hyenas , ' she says			0
' i was never scared			0
' as the interview concludes , madame @entity0 ca n't resist revealing one more secret of her longevity			1
' @entity227 , ' she said , and paused			0

madame @entity0 has 54 grandchildren and great grandchildren
she has survived two world wars and the @entity84 occupation
the secrets of her eternal youth include hard work , sleeping very little and deadly animals
