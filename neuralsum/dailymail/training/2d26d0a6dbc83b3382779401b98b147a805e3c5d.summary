the owner of the shelter brought the dog to two hands @entity12 , founder @entity31 told the site , detailing his strenuous rehab			0
‘ i took him [ @entity3 ] straight to the neurologist , and she knew we did n't have the roughly $ 8,000 to do an mri and surgery , ’ ms @entity43 recalled , ‘ so she told us to just try rehab to see if we could get him up again			1
’ the dog was put through a rigorous physical therapy program spanning four hours each @entity49 included having @entity3 ‘ in the pool , doing massage , laser , acupuncture , assisted standing and assisted walking in the quad cart , ’ she added			1
in the beginning : @entity3 could n't walk and had to rely on people carrying him , as well as the walking cart in the foreground poor pooch : @entity3 was weak and unable to move any of his legs despite stiff limbs that made the process ‘ incredibly difficult , ’ the team plugged away , she said.another hurdle encounter by the team was when @entity3 lost the ability to pee			1
‘ [ it ] became life - threatening , and we actually thought we would lose him because of this , ’ ms @entity43 said			2
another group , the @entity77 , became aware of the dog ’s dire condition and was able to cobble together donations totalling $ 6,000 in less than one day , the group ’s director told @entity17			0
@entity3 was sent for an mri , and then went into surgery – during which doctors discovered the shocking extent of the damage to @entity3 ’s spine , and said he might not survive , let alone walk again			2
the @entity88 ’s battle still was n’t over , as he contracted pneumonia less than a month later			2
‘ it was scary touch - and - go for a few days , ’ but @entity3 made it , ms @entity43 told @entity17			1
a lot of physical therapy : many people worked tirelessly to keep @entity3 's limbs strong while he recovered a long road to recovery : the chances of recovery appeared bleak , but @entity3 began to pull through baby steps : @entity3 was able to walk with some assistance after a few weeks @entity3 ’s rehab went into overdrive when he was finally healthy again			1
‘ at times we had four people in the pool with him , each one ' walking ' a leg to mimic the motion of movement , ’ she said			0
‘ he probably got at least 25 hours of physical therapy a week , including acupuncture			2
’ ms @entity43 reserved her optimism , but did n’t lose all hope			0
‘ i rarely see dogs walk again after being down that long			0
i frankly did n't think we would get this puppy up again , ’ she told the site			0
