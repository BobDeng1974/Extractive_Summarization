by @entity0 the @entity1 discovered the perils of wearing pearls around children today			2
particularly if they happen to be large , shiny and , frankly , very tempting drop earrings			2
on a visit to open the new @entity9 , @entity7 was cuddling 10 - month - old @entity10 when the baby made a grab for her jewellery			1
the enterprising – and rather nattily dressed - youngster managed to yank the earring from her ear and waved it admiringly			2
yoink ! the @entity1 holds 10 - month - old @entity10 , who managed to pull her earring off , as she visits the @entity20 at the new @entity9 , fortunately the royal – who has two children and five grandchildren of her own – took it all in her stride , reassuring wincing hospital staff : ‘ do n’t worry , it ’s a clip on			1
’ @entity28 appeared a natural as she cradled @entity30 , who was born prematurely at 26 weeks and requires intravenous feeding due to ongoing gastroenterital difficulties , ‘ holding him like this reminds me of @entity37 , ’ @entity7 said , referring to her step - son , prince @entity34 ’s baby			1
@entity28 was accompanying her husband on a visit to @entity9 and @entity41 ’s new state - of - the - art facility dedicated to providing specialist care for children			1
caring for more than 75,000 children , both inpatients and outpatients , each year , it is one of the busiest units in the country			0
laughing it off : fortunately the royal - who has two children and five grandchildren of her own - took it all in her stride , reassuring wincing hospital staff : ' do n't worry , it 's a clip on ' the royal visitors were taken to the @entity20 where they met paediatric surgeons operating the @entity64 ’s only paediatric @entity63 robot			1
its arms move in a way which mimics the human wrist but with more precision , enabling operations to be carried out with more intricacy and less damage to tissue			0
@entity28 was keen to try it for herself although , when she discovered just how tricky it really was joked that it was rather lucky there was n’t a real patient there			0
@entity80 quickly followed suit , with his wife providing what she described as a ‘ back seat driver ’ role			1
grand opening : the @entity87 and @entity7 officially open the new @entity9 , at the @entity9 and @entity41 in @entity88 the couple also met cheeky little @entity90 , son of @entity92 presenter @entity91 , who showed off his prosthetic limb			1
@entity90 , now five , was born with serious leg deformities which meant he might never walk			0
in his short life , he has undergone countless , often agonising treatments , including the amputation of one foot , and was yesterday admitted to the hospital for further surgery			0
but that has failed to alter his infectious zest for life and on meeting the prince yesterday he excitedly asked him what football team he supports			1
@entity80 , looking a little flustered dodged the question , but when @entity90 revealed he supported beleaguered @entity106 , he prince muttered knowingly : ‘ ah , i do n’t think we should talk about that			1
’ testing , testing : the royal couple also had a go at operating the hospital 's ' @entity63 ' robot , the @entity64 's first surgical arm dedicated to babies and children that 's clever ! the arm enables operations to be carried out with more intricacy and less damage and scarring to tissue @entity90 then animatedly told the @entity1 he had just been to see @entity125 to which @entity7 , mimicking the film ’s catchphrase , replied : ‘ as yes , my grandchildren have been to see that			2
it ’s awesome ! ’ the royal couple also had a go at operating the hospital 's ' @entity63 ' robot , the @entity64 's first surgical arm dedicated to babies and children			0
the arm enables operations to be carried out with more intricacy and less damage and scarring to tissue			0
@entity7 had most success at the helm of the £ 1 million state - of - the - art surgical arm , which moves in a way which mimics the human wrist but with more precision			1
she was soon able to master the device , as a doctor joked : ' the patient is alive ! ' @entity80 quickly gave up after struggling to get the hang of the mechanism			2
both he and @entity7 were later presented with certificates of competence in surgical training			2
they greeted a number of young patients and their parents at the hospital , which was created through a redevelopment of paediatric services at the @entity9 and @entity162			2
@entity80 quickly gave up after struggling to get the hang of the mechanism , @entity7 had much more success			1
both he and @entity7 were later presented with certificates of competence in surgical training football chat : prince @entity80 declined to reveal which football team he supported to a young @entity106 fan the children 's hospital has been treating patients since september 2011			1
it now comprises four new paediatric theatres , four new wards including a high dependency unit , dedicated children 's burns unit , and a neonatal intensive care unit			0
the new facility follows in the tradition of its predecessor , @entity182 , which was built in 1907 and had its services transferred to @entity9 and @entity41 when it was opened by the @entity184 in 1993			1
unveiling a plaque to open the facility , @entity80 said : " we are so delighted to come and join you on this occasion			2
we both worried a great deal that we 'd caused enough disruption to the smooth running of this hospital for one day			0
the children 's hospital now comprises four new paediatric theatres , four new wards including a high dependency unit , dedicated children 's burns unit , and a neonatal intensive care unit ' but nevertheless we 've had a brief glimpse of the remarkable services provided by the hospital and in particular the children 's department			0
we 'd like to congratulate all those who completed the project on time and on budget			0
it is a remarkable achievement			0
' the @entity87 also hailed the role played by nurses and volunteers at the hospital , adding : ' you play such an important part in the life of the capital and the life of the country and you 've transformed so many people 's lives			0
' @entity219 , clinical director of children 's and young people 's services , said : ' i hope you 've had a flavour of what the children 's hospital is all about			0
it 's about all aspects of children 's care , educating them , to give them and their families the absolute best care in @entity88			0
' remarkable : prince @entity80 said of his visit : ' we 've had a brief glimpse of the remarkable services provided by the hospital and in particular the children 's department '			1
