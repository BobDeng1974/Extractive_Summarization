@entity1 ’s training set - up is under urgent review after it emerged he was training alongside a convicted doper			1
@entity5 athletics have admitted to @entity6 that they have been using a coach heavily connected with a drugs cheat to organise the double @entity11 champion ’s trip to @entity12 and provide running partners for his sessions			0
@entity15 , described as an ‘ unofficial facilitator ’ to the governing body during @entity19 ’s seven - week stay in the high altitude town of @entity21 earlier this year , provided athletes , including former world junior 1500m champion @entity23 , to train with @entity19			1
this picture , posted by @entity23 , that appears to show the athletes travelling in a minibus @entity1 and @entity23 are pictured training together on the latter 's @entity29 page @entity19 celebrates breaking the world record for the @entity32 two miles final at the @entity33 @entity23 , 20 is currently serving a two - year @entity35 ban for irregularities in his biological passport , which date back to august 2 , 2012 , when he was being trained by @entity15			1
the ban began on @entity41 but was only made public last week			0
@entity15 was @entity42 ’s coach intermittently since 2011 but he denies knowingly allowing a doper to train alongside @entity45 ’s most decorated and celebrated track star			2
@entity47 ’ performance director @entity46 and head of endurance @entity49 were with @entity19 in @entity12 but also deny knowing who @entity23 was			1
@entity19 delighted the crowds in @entity53 as he crossed the line in record time at the @entity55 a @entity47 spokeswoman said : ‘ we have already sought assurances and @entity15 states that he did n’t hear of the ban until over a week after @entity23 ’s departure [ from @entity12 ] about the ban relating to his blood passport and is obviously very unhappy about the situation			1
‘ of course we will be looking into it further , but that ’s what we know right now			0
@entity46 and @entity49 were not concerned by anything while out there			0
it ’s too early to say it ’s raised concerns but understandably they will review the whole set - up			0
’ while there is no suggestion that @entity19 is involved in any wrongdoing , it is another damaging blow to his image just a week after he was involved in an unseemly @entity79 spat with @entity45 team - mate and rival @entity80			2
the training spell in @entity12 helped @entity19 's condition , and he said he was in the ' best shape ' of his life the @entity35 are likely to investigate why @entity23 , who was born in @entity86 but competes for @entity87 , was partaking in formal training at all , apparently contravening rules which state banned athletes are prohibited from ‘ participating in any capacity ... in a training camp , exhibition or practice ’			1
although @entity19 , who won @entity11 golds at 5,000m and 10,000m in @entity97 in 2012 , will not face any action from the @entity35 , he could be embroiled in any investigation as a witness			0
@entity19 ’s camp made an attempt to distance themselves from @entity42 , claiming he did not even know who he was running alongside much of the time and implying @entity106 had ‘ jumped in ’ on his session			1
the double @entity11 champions poses back on the track where he won gold in @entity97 earlier this month several pictures later emerged showing them running , travelling back from the track and dining together but a source close to @entity19 said : ‘ he is so focused on his training that he often does n’t know the identity of other athletes around him			2
’ allowances do have to be made for the cultural differences between training in the @entity5 or @entity125 and in @entity126 , where things are more relaxed and young children and animals often run alongside elite athletes on the trails			0
but those charged with protecting @entity19 ’s clean image surely have to take more care about the background of athletes he is being exposed to , even if they could not reasonably be expected to know about @entity23 ’s ban			1
@entity23 ( third right ) competes for @entity87 at the @entity11 at @entity97 's @entity141 in 2012 there will be awkward questioins for @entity15 , given that @entity23 was only 17 when the abnormalities in his biological passport first occured			0
many will want to know who he got performance enhancing substances from			0
@entity47 came under fire in 2013 for sanctioning @entity19 to have a training session with controversial sprint coach @entity152 , who led @entity153 to 100m gold in @entity155 in 2000 , but was named in official documents connected to the @entity158 drugs scandal that brought down @entity159 and @entity160 .			2

pictures taken during training camp show @entity1 with @entity23
@entity23 is serving two - year ban and can not attend training camps
@entity19 ’s agent @entity168 said the athlete hired local runners to train
*facebook* posts appear to show the pair training and on a minibus
