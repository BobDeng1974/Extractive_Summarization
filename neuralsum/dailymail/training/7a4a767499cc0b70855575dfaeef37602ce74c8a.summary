building work underway with the project said to be more straightforward than @entity16 because several venues are already on the site due to its former role in hosting the @entity80 flowing design : cutting through the centre of the park is the @entity94 which reflects the design of pavements across @entity19 which show the merging of the darker waters of the @entity99 and the lighter waters of the @entity101 in the @entity102 big project : mr @entity82 looks over his designs			1
unlike the @entity65 , the main olympic stadium is not at the park - athletes will use the famous @entity19 football stadium , the @entity68 , which will also be the site of the opening and closing ceremonies as well as the @entity73 - home to the club side @entity74 @entity84 , based in @entity113 , @entity16 , were also responsible for designing @entity16 's much - heralded olympic park in @entity115			1
@entity82 , 51 , who led @entity84 's @entity6 bid to win the contract said : ' it is very exciting			0
it will show off the best of @entity19 architecture in a magnificent setting			1
' this is the first @entity124 in @entity125 and @entity6 is the most beautiful city in the world and we have tried to reflect the beauty and spirit of the place in our masterplan			0
' explaining how it will differ from the @entity16 park , @entity82 added : ' @entity16 was very complex because of the old industry and network of canals			2
@entity6 is more straightforward in that it is flat and already partially developed			0
' but our approach has been very similar , especially with regards to leaving a legacy and in using @entity19 architects in the same way all smiles : @entity82 stands over the model			1
venues such as the velodrome and aquatics centre are already at the site , requiring only minor conversions to bring them up to standard to host the @entity80			2
and unlike @entity16 , the park will also host the @entity24 tennis @entity155 architects were used in @entity16			1
that is something that was key in @entity16 and @entity158 ( @entity159 , the mayor of @entity6 ) was keen to do the same			0
' we are already talking about some interesting ideas of converting some of the temporary venues into public buildings , like schools after the games			0
' @entity82 said one of the main challenges facing @entity6 was public transport			2
the city of six million people has just two metro lines			0
' the authorities are working on the transport and are extending the lines out to the park			2
the good thing for us , is a lot of the upgrades will be done in time for the @entity182 in 2014 , ' he said			0
venues such as the velodrome and aquatics centre are already at the site , requiring only minor conversions to bring them up to standard to host the @entity80			2
