by @entity0 published : 19:15 est , 22 january 2013 updated : 19:16 est , 22 january 2013 warned : @entity1 has been told by mps that succession reform may open a royal @entity4 @entity1 was accused of ‘ opening a royal @entity4 ’ last night over plans to change the laws of succession to the throne			1
the deputy prime minister told the @entity11 that rules giving precedence to men and the ban on heirs marrying @entity17 belonged to a ‘ bygone era ’			2
the change will mean that if the @entity20 and @entity21 of @entity23 ’s first child , due in july , is a girl , she would ascend the throne even if she had brothers			1
but @entity2 said the @entity27 was being ‘ rushed ’ through @entity28			1
@entity30 mp @entity29 , a close friend of prince @entity31 , said the proposals came from the ‘ good wheeze school of @entity34 ’ and had not been properly thought through			1
mr @entity29 , a grandson of sir @entity35 , warned of the ‘ unwanted , unintended consequences that often flow from tinkering with legislation of this type and could damage the crucial relationship between church and state ’			1
he suggested removing the catholic marriage ban might make it more likely that a @entity43 would eventually succeed to the throne - sparking a constitutional crisis			1
this fear is also said to be shared by @entity31			2
fellow @entity30 @entity47 said an oversight in the legislation could create a financial crisis for a future female monarch as she would not inherit the £ 350 million @entity53 estate if she had a younger brother			0
mr @entity47 said the proposals would ‘ disinherit the monarch ’			0
the @entity58 ’s @entity57 said it was ‘ utter folly ’ to introduce a measure to allow the heir to the throne to marry a @entity43 , warning mps the @entity64 opened the ‘ royal @entity4 ’			2
‘ we ought to be minimising points of potential crisis , not creating the certainty that there will be a crisis , ’ he said			0
‘ we will create a potential set of circumstances where a future heir will have to make a choice between faith and throne , and such a choice , to discard a closely held faith for position , i believe simply creates another simply unjust choice that a person will have to make			2
’ changes : the reform of the law will mean that the first - born child to prince @entity87 and the @entity21 due in july will ascend the throne regardless of whether it is a boy or a girl @entity93 ’s @entity92 questioned why the @entity64 was being rushed through			1
he said that by retaining the ban on a catholic becoming monarch , the @entity64 ‘ strengthens the prejudice of the past by not allowing all citizens the chance to become monarch ’			2
he accused mr @entity1 of tinkering ’ with the constitution , warning that the changes contained the ‘ seeds of future problems that will be obvious in the years ahead ’			2
critic : conservative mp , and friend of @entity31 , @entity29 but mr @entity1 insisted the changes were necessary to bring the monarchy into the 21st century and end the system of primogeniture , which he said was based on the ‘ supposed superiority of men ’			1
he said : ‘ the current rules of succession belong to a bygone era			0
they reflect old prejudices and old fears			0
‘ today we do n’t support laws which discriminate on either religious or gender grounds , they have no place in modern @entity124 and certainly not in our monarchy , an an institution central to our constitution , to the @entity128 and to our national identity too			0
’ mr @entity1 told the @entity11 that the 16 @entity128 countries only agreed the @entity64 in writing just hours before the @entity20 and @entity21 announced they were having a baby			1
he said he was ‘ sympathetic ’ to calls to alter the rules for the inheritance of hereditary titles			0
but he said it was vital to keep the changes simple so that they would be accepted by the other @entity128 nations			0
mr @entity1 said the ban on @entity43 marriages were part of historic @entity143 laws that had mostly now been swept away			1
‘ @entity17 could n’t vote , they were excluded from all professions and public offices , they could n’t go to university , could n’t teach , could n’t be the guardian of a child , could n’t buy land with a lease of more than 31 years , could n’t own a horse worth more than £ 5 , ’ he said			0
mr @entity57 joked he would not refer to the time when @entity17 suffered widespread discrimination as ‘ those @entity155 ’			0
mps backed the law without a vote .			0

change means @entity20 and @entity21 of @entity23 *'s* *firstborn* would ascend the throne - even if it is a girl and eventually had brothers
