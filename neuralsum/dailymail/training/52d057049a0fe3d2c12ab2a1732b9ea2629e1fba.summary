by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 09:06 est , 25 january 2013 updated : 16:11 est , 25 january 2013 @entity3 would quit the @entity4 if a referendum was held now , a surprise new poll revealed today			1
in the wake of @entity9 ’s high profile speech on giving voters a say on severing ties with @entity13 , research showed 40 per cent of people now back an exit while 37 per cent want to stay in			1
the @entity17 survey would translate to a 53 - 47 vote in favour of leaving after other factors , such as likelihood to vote , were taken into account			1
mr @entity9 has insisted he wants @entity3 to remain within the @entity4 but only after negotiating a fresh settlement , clawing back powers from @entity13			1
the @entity35 are to start drawing up legislation now to hold a referendum , which would be staged after the next election but before 2017			1
according to the @entity17 / @entity41 poll , mr @entity9 ’s long - awaited speech has done little to help his prospects of securing a @entity44 majority at the 2015 election			1
three quarters of supporters of the @entity48 said they were unmoved by the speech , and 17 per cent said they were less likely to back the @entity50 in future			1
just 8 per cent of @entity53 supporters said they were no more minded to back mr @entity9			1
in a speech at the @entity25 in @entity55 , mr @entity9 sought to reassure business leaders that @entity3 was not ‘ turning our backs on @entity27 ’			0
but he told them @entity27 was being ‘ out - competed , out - invested , out - innovated ’ and must be transformed into an engine for growth			2
the pm discussed the proposals in a 15 - minute meeting with @entity64 chancellor @entity63 , who has indicated she is open to a ‘ fair compromise ’ with @entity3			2
@entity66 said he was ' none the wiser ' about how the @entity60 's plans to claw back powers would actually work deputy prime minister @entity66 said he is ‘ still none the wiser about exactly what this great re-negotiation means ’			1
in an interview with @entity74 , he said : ‘ it was a well - crafted speech and obviously very well delivered			2
but in terms of the content , look , the @entity44 will obviously ride away with headlines about the referendum today			0
my own view is that it will be a tactical victory today for a strategic mistake tomorrow			0
’ meanwhile , @entity83 leader @entity82 sought to clarify his own position on @entity27 , after appearing to rule out an in / out referendum in the @entity86			0
he said : ‘ i am being clear			0
i do not think it makes sense , now , to commit to an in / out referendum years ahead			0
‘ and the reason why it does not make sense is clear from what the priority of the @entity3 people is			0
their priority is jobs and growth and living standards and i 've got to say what i think the right priority is and i do not believe now it makes sense to commit to an in / out referendum			0
’ in an interview with @entity106 , mr @entity9 insisted the @entity107 was not planning to ‘ storm off ’ if its calls for reform were not met			0
‘ we 're not putting a list of demands on the table and saying we 'll storm off if we do n't get them , ’ he said			0
‘ what we 're saying is we should in @entity27 have changes that will benefit all of the countries of the @entity4 , but which at the same time will , i think , make @entity3 more comfortable with her place in the @entity4			2

40 *%* back exit compared to 37 per cent who want to stay in @entity4
@entity17 poll result suggests 53 - 47 vote in favour of exit
@entity60 promised to claw back powers before staging referendum in 2017
