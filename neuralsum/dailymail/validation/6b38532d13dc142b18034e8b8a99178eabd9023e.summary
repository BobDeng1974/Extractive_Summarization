unless @entity0 can produce the greatest result in their @entity3 history - arguably their entire history - and overturn a 2 - 1 first - leg deficit against @entity7 on wednesday night , @entity4 faces an embarrassing total wipeout from this season 's @entity9			1
with @entity12 dumping @entity13 out last week and @entity14 resisting @entity16 's spirited fightback on tuesday night , we face the prospect of having no @entity19 representatives in the quarter - finals			1
the @entity4 charge on the continent halted by mid-march ? it never used to be like this , you know			0
@entity16 's @entity26 is commiserated as @entity14 celebrate knocking out the @entity4 side on tuesday dejected @entity13 players walk off the field at @entity30 after their @entity9 exit to @entity12 @entity32 roars his frustration during @entity0 's first - leg defeat to @entity7 at the @entity35 this graphic showing the @entity4 clubs that have reached the @entity9 quarter - finals since 2004 you do n't have to flick too far back through the record books to find a time when @entity4 ruled in @entity43 's foremost club competition			1
the last halcyon days were the three seasons from 2006 - 07 until the end of 2008 - 09 , when the @entity19 supplied 11 of the 24 quarter - finalists			1
going back to @entity49 's miraculous triumph in @entity50 in 2005 , @entity4 has provided eight of the 20 finalists			2
in the 2006 - 07 season , @entity49 , @entity13 and @entity53 all made it to the semi-finals			1
they all repeated the feat 12 months later , with @entity53 beating @entity13 on penalties in the @entity60 final			0
in 2008 - 09 , @entity53 knocked out @entity16 in the last four , while @entity7 squeezed past @entity13			1
since then , it 's been an overall trend of decline			0
while @entity53 were runners - up again in 2011 and @entity13 lifted the trophy in 2012 , as well as reaching the semi-finals last season , the @entity4 dominance seen during that golden three - year period has n't been replicated			1
@entity13 and @entity53 contested the 2008 @entity9 final in a golden period for @entity4 @entity53 met @entity16 in the @entity9 semi-finals in the 2008 - 09 campaign @entity13 and @entity49 met in the 2008 @entity9 semi-finals , with the @entity76 club advancing the mantle has been passed to @entity78 , who will expect to see @entity7 , @entity80 and @entity81 in the last four unless paired in the next round			1
so while the @entity19 continues to grow ever - richer , with the astonishing Â£ 5.1bn television deal signed earlier this year ensuring record returns for years to come , money does n't necessarily guarantee success across the board in @entity43			2
though @entity13 reached the last four a year ago , @entity53 exited at the quarter - final stage , while @entity0 and @entity16 departed in the last 16			1
the season 2012 - 13 was even worse , with @entity53 and @entity16 crashing out in the last 16 and @entity13 and @entity0 failing to get out of their groups			1
there is n't one single reason to explain this slump in @entity19 performance , but a growing school of thought is that the lack of a winter break is beginning to hold our teams back			1
sir @entity100 , @entity101 and @entity102 have always advocated a winter pause and the evidence to support them grows with every passing season			0
@entity107 and @entity53 were beaten by @entity108 in last season 's quarter - finals @entity111 scores for @entity7 in their win over @entity0 this time last season @entity115 and @entity16 were eliminated by @entity108 at the last - 16 stage last season city boss @entity117 joined the chorus in an interview with @entity120 this week , saying : ' december and january are very tough months because of the number of games			1
' you reach an important part of the season and you are not in optimum shape because there is no winter break as there is in other countries			2
' @entity4 football gives other leagues an advantage			0
there are some traditions you ca n't change , i realise that			0
but you ca n't play nine games in december and nine in january			0
you have to stop at some point			0
' he has a point			0
the quantity and intensity of fixtures in @entity4 means that no player can emerge from the hectic december and january period firing on all cylinders			0
it is a time that features vital matches in the @entity19 as the title race takes shape , while the leading clubs are increasingly keen to win the @entity154 and @entity155 , which might at one time have warranted weakened teams			2
the leading sides are scared witless of finishing the season empty - handed - even the once - maligned @entity155 is now taken seriously			0
man city manager @entity117 has joined the chorus of managers favouring a winter break @entity12 did n't play a competitive match between december 21 and january 4 @entity13 played five times during that period , including a 5 - 3 defeat at @entity168 on @entity169 in explaining @entity13 's exit , you might consider that @entity12 did n't play a single competitive match between december 21 and january 4			1
in that same time , @entity13 played @entity173 , @entity174 , @entity175 , @entity168 and @entity176			0
while @entity14 broke off after winning at @entity177 on december 20 and did n't resume until january 4 , @entity16 had to play @entity49 , @entity178 , @entity174 , @entity175 and @entity179			2
for both @entity76 clubs , the fixtures continued to come thick and fast in the subsequent six weeks before their @entity3 ties			0
and while @entity0 played @entity185 , @entity186 , @entity187 , @entity188 and @entity189 , @entity7 were out of action			2
after cruising into the winter break with an 8 - 1 rout of @entity193 and a 5 - 0 win over @entity195 , when they resumed , @entity196 - after a shock defeat by @entity199 - recorded thrashings of @entity200 ( 5 - 0 , 4 - 0 and 6 - 0 ) and @entity201 ( 4 - 0 )			1
there is no escaping the reality that @entity7 's matches are far more straightforward than those played by @entity0			2
little wonder they had the greater energy at the @entity35			0
@entity7 had not only a winter break but a reasonably straightforward run of games in january while football over the @entity214 period should be kept sacred , a couple of weeks off in january would not go amiss and would boost @entity4 chances of getting through the last - 16 stage			1
the scrapping of @entity154 replays would also be a sensible move			0
of course , there was no winter break in @entity4 between 2006 and 2009 , but @entity4 clubs still prospered			1
this points perhaps to a growing pace and intensity of all domestic games and perhaps a strategic naivety in approaching two - legged ties			0
@entity229 , well - placed to compare styles having played for @entity108 and @entity53 , observed on @entity231 last week that : ' if we got past the first 20 or 30 minutes , we 'd probably win the game because the @entity4 teams used to come out all guns blazing , the defence would push the team forward and we used to realise if we could keep it at 0 - 0 we would win			0
' in the @entity19 , that works , but in @entity43 the teams are too talented , too good in possession			0
' should @entity0 exit , as expected , against @entity7 , the debate as to why @entity4 clubs no longer reach the latter stages of the @entity9 en masse will intensify			1
there is no definitive answer or quick fix but a breather in @entity4 football 's ruthless , relentless schedule is an increasingly popular option to give our teams a fighting chance in @entity43 .			2

@entity13 and @entity16 are already out of @entity9 at last - 16 stage
@entity0 are likely to follow , trailing @entity7 2 - 1 after home leg
@entity49 did n't even get through the group phase this season
@entity19 clubs ' performance has declined in last few seasons
golden period between 2006 - 2009 saw @entity4 with 11 quarter - finalists
managers are increasingly calling for winter break to boost chances
all participants have struggled with intense and relentless fixture list
