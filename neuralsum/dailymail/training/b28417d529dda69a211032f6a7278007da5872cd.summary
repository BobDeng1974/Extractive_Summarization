a migration agent who has been banned for five years after he allegedly groomed a client to act gay so that he had more chance of getting an @entity5 visa has vowed to clear his name			1
@entity8 based lawyer @entity7 is reported to have taken a wannabe migrant to @entity10 and @entity11 , areas of the city popular with the gay community , and advised him to tell a tribunal that he was homosexual			1
however , mr @entity7 told @entity16 he is launching an appeal with the @entity18 against the @entity20 's ruling			1
‘ i obviously deny that allegation , ’ mr @entity7 said , highlighting that he believes the whole story has not been told			2
his solicitor @entity24 added : ‘ we are preparing an appeal urgently			0
we are beyond appalled by the nature of the allegations that have been presented , they are gravely defamatory			0
’ a migration agent has been banned from practising from five years after he allegedly took a wannabe migrant to @entity10 ( pictured ) and @entity11 and advised him to tell a tribunal that he was homosexual in a court appearance , involving a man who wanted to live in @entity5 named mr @entity34 , it was alleged that mr @entity7 ‘ advised and assisted him to apply for a protection visa based on fabricated claims of being homosexual ’			1
to support the claims for his visa application , mr @entity34 claimed that mr @entity7 took him to @entity10 and @entity11			2
the client was interviewed by the @entity20 on 17 december 2012			0
however , mr @entity7 stated that mr @entity34 ’s complaint was motivated by personal gain			2
in another tribunal involving a man named as mr @entity48 , it was also alleged mr @entity7 advised him to apply for a protection visa based on fraudulent claims of being homosexual			1
in other complaints about the migration agent , protection visas were also lodged on religious grounds			1
eight complaints were made against the migration agent by his clients , the @entity57 , the @entity58 and the @entity59 legal services commissioner @entity20 said in total they received eight complaints about the agent ’s conduct and the immigration assistance he provided to protection visa applicants between november 2011 to june 2013			1
these complaints were from individual clients , the @entity57 , the @entity58 and the @entity59 legal services commissioner			0
‘ the complaints alleged that the agent encouraged and assisted his clients to lodge applications for @entity74 visas with claims that were fabricated , ’ a ruling on the @entity20 website says			2
in response to an official warning notice from @entity20 , mr @entity7 said ‘ there is no evidence to substantiate the allegations of fraud ’			1
he also claimed the alleged ‘ unusual similarities ’ attached to the homosexual lifestyle of his visa applicants ‘ do not establish any element of causation of fraud ’			0
in some cases he called his clients ‘ self - confessed liars ’ and questioned the validity of their claims against him			0
it was alleged that mr @entity7 ' advised and assisted [ a client ] to apply for a protection visa based on fabricated claims of being homosexual ' mr @entity7 first registered as a migration agent on 9 february 1995 and records show he mainly practices in relation to protection visas			1
protection visas allow migrants to live and work in @entity5 as a permanent resident but to qualify for them you must be a refugee as defined by the @entity104			1
or you may also meet the @entity74 criteria in the @entity107			0
in some countries being gay is a crime and thus homosexuals can be granted refugee status in @entity5 if they face persecution in their home countries			2
for example , in @entity116 this year the president approved a new law that imposes life sentences for homosexuality ; he also made it a crime to fail to report someone for breaking the new law			0
protection visas lodged inside @entity5 cost $ 35 and are far cheaper than other visas , such as a @entity127 which starts at $ 3250			2
to be granted a protection visa you need to be either a refugee as defined by the @entity104 : refugees convention : the term ‘ refugee ’ is defined as a person who owing to well - founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race , religion , nationality , membership of a particular social group or political opinion , is outside the country of his nationality and is unable or , owing to such fear , is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country ; or who , not having a nationality and being outside the country of his former habitual residence , is unable or , owing to such fear , is unwilling to return to it			0
or you must meet the @entity74 criteria in the @entity107 1958 : circumstances where there are substantial grounds for believing that , as a necessary and foreseeable consequence of a non-citizen ’s removal from @entity5 to a receiving country , there is a real risk the non-citizen will suffer significant harm			0
the @entity20 investigated a sample of mr @entity7 ’s client , departmental and tribunal files – a total of 73 files - and found ‘ a pattern of poor practices which breached the @entity173 ’			1
‘ @entity174 found that the agent prepared and submitted applications containing generalised information not supported by instructions from his clients ; he included misleading and inaccurate statements to enhance the prospects of success of the visa applications ; and failed to provide frank and candid advice to his clients about the prospects of success of their visa applications			0
‘ as a result of the investigation the @entity174 was satisfied that the agent had breached multiple provisions of the @entity173 and was not a person of integrity , and not a fit and proper person to give immigration assistance , ’ the ruling states .			0
