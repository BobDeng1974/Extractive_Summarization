as @entity5 's @entity4 reign began with a dispiriting 2 - 1 home defeat by @entity7 , the disintegration of his team may have taken him by surprise			1
while @entity4 's players have produced vibrant and intense performances in pre-season , this was a return to the sluggish , timid and disappointing performances of last season			2
@entity15 has spent the last month training him players intensively in the 3 - 5 - 2 formation but that system was shelved after just 45 minutes amid a spate of injuries and an unconvincing first half showing			1
@entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45 would all have walked into the starting line - up and offered a more formidable threat			0
throughout the team , @entity4 players looked uncomfortable , short of purpose and it resulted in a sluggish and flat performance			1
@entity53 appeared uneasy as part of the defensive three while @entity56 and @entity57 failed to provide a shield to the defence , leaving their team - mates brutally exposed for @entity7 's opening goal			1
nothing , however , should be taken away from @entity7 , who made 28 passes in the lead up to @entity67 's superbly taken strike			2
perhaps the biggest concern for @entity15 will have been the anonymity of @entity70			1
if this system is partially devised to liberate the @entity72 in his favoured central position , then @entity15 needs @entity70 to shine			1
@entity74 was similarly ineffective in in the first - half , while @entity76 was substituted at half - time			1
in truth , though , the @entity78 is a penalty - box forward and relies on service from his team - mates			0
he was the one picked out by @entity15 but @entity76 was let down by those behind him			2
built around him : but @entity70 did n't shine in a 3 - 5 - 2 formation do @entity4 have the players to play 3 - 5 - 2 ? the evidence of pre-season suggests so but on saturday lunchtime , it was dysfunctional and there were too many square pegs in round holes			1
@entity94 was caught out a couple of times at right wing - back before succumbing to injury early on			0
@entity99 replaced him in that position and he , frankly , is far too good going forward to have to worry about defensive concerns			0
@entity15 's preference to play three at the back is sadly undermined by the glaring truth that only @entity42 has proved himself as a defender of @entity4 quality in recent years			2
the jury is out on @entity53 and @entity108 while @entity109 , the most impressive @entity4 defender against @entity7 , has only one @entity111 appearance to his name			2
evidently , @entity15 needs his chief executive @entity113 to close some deals			2
@entity115 of @entity116 is believed to be close but @entity4 now have only two weeks to act			0
they knew @entity117 was leaving at the turn of the year and it was expected that @entity120 would follow - how have they left it so late ? no cover : it was unfair to expect @entity109 to solve problems on his @entity4 debut @entity4 also appear short in central midfield			0
@entity57 is stylish and composed and @entity56 is steady but @entity15 needs some bite in there and somebody that can grab a football match by the scruff of its neck			1
@entity4 continue to deny links to @entity137 ' @entity136 but he would be an ideal signing after missing out on @entity139 and @entity140			0
@entity141 said on @entity142 : ' the big thing for me was the quality just was n’t there in the midfield			0
' [ @entity74 ] @entity74 and [ @entity70 ] @entity70 could n't feed off anything			1
' the big thing about @entity5 spending big money now is – who comes in ? is the quality there ? the two big players have n’t come – @entity155 and @entity139			0
' @entity157 of the league @entity156 struggled adapt to the rigours @entity111 too much space : @entity67 rounded off a fine first half for the visitors with the opening goal what changed in the second half ? @entity4 changed to what @entity15 described as a 4 - 3 - 3 but to the layman appeared to be a 4 - 4 - 1 - 1 : @entity168 ; @entity53 , @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity169 ; @entity99 , @entity57 , @entity56 , @entity170 ; @entity70 , @entity74			1
for 20 minutes , the plan appeared to be working as @entity74 equalised			2
briefly , @entity4 threatened to build up a head of steam but the momentum was killed by @entity7 's second goal			1
in previous years , when @entity4 equalise at @entity34 , you expect the whole tone of the game to shift and the @entity179 to be launched towards the opponent 's goal , as @entity4 attack with dynamism , pace and fury			0
a @entity74 free - kick aside , @entity4 barely threatened			1
even in six minutes of added time - @entity188 had only signalled for four ( some things stay the same at @entity34 ) - @entity4 did not create a chance of note			0
in a striking similarity to last season , @entity4 were ponderous , hesitant and seemed to lack the belief to go for the throat of the opponents			0
again , players looked uneasy in their roles , and @entity169 's misjudgement for the second goal was typical of an attacking winger being asked to play as a full - back			1
ultimately , systems , formations or philosophies can become meaningless if the personnel is not up to scratch or the players are bereft of confidence			0
impressive : @entity99 could be the flying winger @entity4 fans have come to expect at @entity34 should @entity4 be ditching the wingers ? evidently , @entity170 , @entity169 and @entity211 have not demonstrated enough in recent times to warrant a place on the wing in a 4 - 4 - 2			1
you can understand , therefore , why @entity15 has experimented with the 3 - 5 - 2			1
however , we should not forget that these @entity4 supporters have been groomed on the sir @entity219 philosophy that centred around flying wingers - @entity220 , @entity222 , @entity223 , @entity224			0
in @entity99 , @entity4 appear to have another and he is , without question , the most exciting player on @entity4 's books			0
in the long - term , @entity4 view him as a number 10 but his willingness to commit opponents and produce quality makes him @entity4 's stand - out wide player			0
if @entity4 were able to recruit another winger - @entity234 has been monitored this summer , while @entity235 was a target earlier this year - @entity15 would then have the personnel to revert to a style of play that @entity4 fans adore			2
if that signing is not forthcoming , @entity4 followers may have to be patient with this new philosophy - but five shots on target in a game at @entity34 falls below the call of duty			0
on the lookout : @entity15 must strengthen the squad ... but fans also have to be patient with his philosophy			2

@entity15 started with 3 - 5 - 2 formation but players looked lost
@entity57 and @entity56 gave @entity7 too much space
system designed to get the best out of @entity70 but he failed to impress
lack of first - teamers did n't help but matters did n't improve with 4 - 3 - 3
@entity74 scored only goal but @entity265 netted winner
