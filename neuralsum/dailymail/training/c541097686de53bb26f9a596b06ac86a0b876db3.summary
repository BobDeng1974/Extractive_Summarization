by @entity0 a polar bear who survived a near fatal injury has defied the odds and is now rearing a second set of cubs			2
it was feared the bear , who appeared to have a badly broken leg , would have to be put down when spotted on a barrier island in @entity12 , @entity13 in 2009			1
but five years on , the sow has now been spotted with a second set of cubs showing that her disability is not holding her back			2
the female polar bear , who survived a broken leg leads her new cubs along a barrier island in @entity12 , @entity13 the new set of pictures were captured by wildlife photographer , @entity26 , who has been monitoring the bear since 2009 wildlife photographer @entity26 has been monitoring the polar bear over the years , charting her progress			1
he said : ' her new cubs are only a year old and i do n't know if her other cubs made it			0
' i observed her many times during the eight weeks that i was photographing polar bears last fall			0

mr @entity26 says the sow , right , has learned to deal with her disability as one of her legs has calloused over internally the female bear , seen here , starts to head into the water for a swim the two cubs , who follow their mother , are thought to be her second set of cubs			1
her first set were first spotted in 2011 it is thought that the new cubs are around one year old with mr @entity26 monitoring them over an eight week period ' she was feeding , resting , playing , walking and swimming - doing all the natural things you would expect a polar bear to do			1
' i would imagine her chances of survival are pretty good as she has been able to survive with a bad leg and she has her second set of cubs now			2
' i was so happy to see that an animal with a disability was able to learn to live and cope with it			0
' not only that she is thriving and bringing up her offspring			0
' every female polar bear giving birth is a good thing with all the changes that are going on with their habitats			0
the trio of polar bears pause for a break , with one of the cubs lying down rolling about in the snow mr @entity26 said : ' every female polar bear giving birth is a good thing with all the changes that are going on with their habitats			1
' the female bear leads her cubs into the water for a swim in @entity12 , @entity13 ' it shows that she is a very smart mother and is raising intelligent cubs			1
' the bear was first spotted in @entity13 in 2009 , when she appeared to have a badly broken leg , which was causing her to walk more slowly			1
it was thought at the time that she would be unable to survive but remarkably the animal has learned to deal with her disability			2
in 2011 , just two years after her life - threatening injury , she showed up with her first set of cubs			0
photographer mr @entity105 is now interested to see if the bears show up on @entity12 again next year mr @entity26 added : ' we knew it was the same bear because she 's the only one who shows with the same break in the same spot			1
' the first couple of years she walked softly on it but has now figured out how to move efficiently with it			0
' the leg has calloused over internally so it hangs and dangles - it will remain that way for the rest of her life			2
' she moves fine and seems to have more confidence and now has another litter of cubs			0
she just showed up along the coast again and i saw her			0
she is hard to miss with that leg			0
' it will be interesting to see if she shows up next fall			0
' mr @entity26 believes that the female polar bear is a ' a very smart mother and is raising intelligent cubs ' .			1
