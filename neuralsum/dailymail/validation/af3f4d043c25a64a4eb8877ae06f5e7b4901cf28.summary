a stag party in @entity1 is usually the cue to go a little crazy			1
but the groom , my mate @entity3 , was adamant he did n't want ' crazy '			1
on this trip , we were determined to do things differently			0
after all , we are all older and wiser now … @entity1 was n't the first choice among our party - we had originally planned to go to @entity11			1
there were going to be just five of us , so we thought we would head somewhere with some nightlife and a good spa so that we could relax too			0
the famous @entity1 casinos are definitely worth a punt if you 're feeling flush but then the number who wanted to travel grew to ten , so @entity3 suddenly announced : ' we 're going to @entity1			0
i do n't care if it 's been done before – we 're going to go and do our best out there			2
' as @entity3 's best man , it was my job to organise the stag party - and i discovered what a nightmare that can be			1
first of all , it was impossible to get everyone to pay the money at the right time			0
and then those who had said they were coming suddenly decided that they could n't make it , and people who had said ' no ' then announced they were available			2
we planned a three - night trip			1
going on past experience , i knew it would be intense - nobody gets much sleep because there is always something going on			2
you plan to go to bed , for example , and then you get sucked into going to a pool party			2
@entity1 is home to many stag and hen parties - but the groom on @entity55 's trip said he did n't want ' crazy ' we stayed at @entity56 , one of the newer hotels in @entity1			1
it 's vast - just walking from one end to the other takes about half an hour			1
it has great shops and 14 different restaurants , including @entity65 , a steakhouse which also has branches in @entity68 and @entity69			1
like most of the hotels in @entity1 , the @entity56 is very skilfully laid out so that it does n't matter where you are going to or coming from , at some point on your journey through the hotel you will find yourself passing the slot machines and the gaming tables			1
nobody gets much sleep in @entity1 because there is always something going on			0
you plan to go to bed , for example , and then you get sucked into going to a pool party when you get to your room at the end of the day , you 're unlikely to have any change in your pockets - it will all have been eaten by the ' slots '			1
i 'm not really a gambler , so i think i probably came home with a little bit more in my pocket than the others			0
i had to be the sensible one , after all , because i saw it as my duty to look after the groom			2
you 're there to make sure he 's having a great time - within the limits , of course			2
as the best man , @entity55 ( left ) was ' mr @entity106 ' on the trip , and looked after the groom - to - be @entity3 ( right ) we did n't start off with a carefully drafted plan about how we spend our days in @entity1 - instead , we decided that we would all meet up at certain points			1
we would all get together at dinner , for example , and then we would all head out to a club afterwards			0
it was n't that difficult to arrange			2
we had three rooms between us , so it was usually just a case of picking up the phone and saying : ' right , we 're meeting in 15 minutes			0
' we looked at going on a @entity121 tour , but in the end we never really escaped the hotel scene – @entity1 really sucked us in , chewed us up and spat us out ! half the time you 're not sure whether it 's breakfast or whether you should be getting ready for a night out while we had planned to take it easy , in the end we partied like we did when we were in our 20s			1
the problem is that when you 're down in the gaming rooms , there is no natural light , so you have no idea whether it 's night or day			0
half the time you 're not sure whether it 's breakfast or whether you should be getting ready for a night out			0
but we all agreed the trip was a huge success			0
we did n't get much sleep but we had plenty of fun			0
and on a stag trip , that 's all you can ask for			0
getting there @entity143 offers three nights in @entity1 from £ 1,379 per person for departures in june			0
this includes return flights from @entity149 to @entity1 and accommodation at @entity56			1
prices for the v - room at @entity149 costs from £ 24.50 per adult and £ 14 for children aged from two to 11 .			1

@entity55 and the groom - to - be had n't planned to go ' crazy ' on the stag do
the party stayed at @entity56 for their three - night stay
hotel had 14 different restaurants and *seemingly* *endless* gambling tables
in the end , the party hardly ever left the vast hotel in @entity168
