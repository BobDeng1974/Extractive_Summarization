designer @entity0 has revealed that she refuses to let images of herself be retouched before they are shown to the public			1
in an age when almost every photo featured in the pages of the world 's favorite fashion magazines has been subject to at least a few photoshop tricks and tweaks , the 22 - year - old insists that people should be able to see her exactly as she is , without any unrealistic enhancements			1
speaking to @entity13 , the designer , who admits to changing dress sizes on a regular basis , confessed that size eight is her ' happy place ' , adding : ' i like eating cookies and food			2
' posing in a stunning set of images for the fashion site , the designer insisted that none of the photos , which were taken in @entity47 , should undergo any ' cosmetic ' alterations			2
and it 's not just this shoot on which @entity0 has taken such a stance			1
indeed after completing her first photoshoot for her fashion range , @entity0 x @entity30 , the burgeoning fashion star noticed that the images had later been retouched - and she promptly sent them back and asked them to be returned to their former natural glory			1
' my legs looked too good , ' she recalls			0
@entity0 is just as straight - talking when it comes to her own perceptions about her body , having spent much of her adolescence living life in the spotlight - and learning to cope with all of the unwanted publicity			1
' we went on a family vacation , and i was wearing a thong bikini like my favorite celebrity , @entity72 , ' she explained , ' and someone took my picture			0
' as a 17 - year - old girl , i had to see my butt on the cover of [ a newspaper ] with the headline ' @entity81 plus - size daughter '			1
it made the global news circuit			0
' i grew up a chubby kid and into a curvy girl			0
i was ok with it , but the world was n't			0
i have cellulite , stretch marks , and freckles , and that 's fine with me			2
' au naturel : @entity0 has had to cope with her fair share of publicity , including being referred to as ' plus size ' when images of her in a bikini aged 17 were published			1
despite that , she insists that natural is always best daughter of blank : the rock heiress first embarked on her fashion career because it allowed her to break free from her famous family name ' i want to give girls confidence ' : @entity0 's fashion label does n't discriminate by size , and she hopes that her designs will suit all women , no matter what their shape having faced her fair share of the spotlight before reaching the age of 18 , beginning when she first starred in her family 's reality series , @entity81 : family jewels , at the age of 11 , @entity0 admits she was eager to step away from the shadow that both of her parents had cast and make a name for herself as a designer			1
' when i 'm singing , i 'm @entity81 's daughter , ' she said			2
' when i 'm acting , i 'm @entity126 's daughter			1
with fashion , i 'm just me			2
i 'm not just " daughter of blank "			0
' that said , @entity0 confesses she was happy to trade on her well - known name to a certain extent - provided she could use it to help her make a change within the industry			1
' i felt like i really had the chance to give girls confidence with affordable clothing , ' she added			0
' if you have a platform , you should use it			0
' free spirit : while she admits that she used to find her father , @entity142 legend @entity81 , a bit ' crass ' , @entity0 reveals that she now embraces that same blunt attitude up close and personal : @entity0 , who is a size eight , admits that many of her favorite designers ' clothes do n't fit her and it 's not just her parents ' creative talents that @entity0 has inherited			1
the designer admits that , while she was often embarrassed by her father 's over-the - top and in - your - face behavior when she was a child , now she sees it as a blessing			2
' when i was little , i 'd think : " ca n't you just be nice ? " ' she said of the 65 - year - old rocker			1
' he taught me that there 's being nice and then there 's lying			2
it 's better to be blunt and un-liked than shade the truth			0
i appreciate people who are honest			0
' her straight - talking attitude no doubt helped when it came to making a name for herself within the fashion industry , marking her out from those designers who only cater to the small , select group of women who can fit into their clothing			1
' i 'm not a high - fashion model , and i 'm not plus size , ' @entity0 says of her own body			1
' which is weird for fashion , but not for life			0
putting your best booty forward : earlier this year , @entity0 admitted to @entity186 that many of the designs for her collection were ' based around my butt ' rising star : @entity0 is used to being in the spotlight , having first risen to fame age 11 when she starred in her family 's reality series @entity81 : family jewels family ties : @entity0 is incredibly close with both her father @entity199 and her mother , former @entity201 , @entity126 ( @entity198 ) ' a lot of designers that i love do n't fit me			1
i wanted to do cuts that would be flattering to girls who have some shape			0
' earlier this year , @entity0 , who is based in @entity208 , revealed to @entity186 that her first 18 - piece collaboration with @entity30 was tailored to suit her own body type - particularly in the derriere			1
' the cuts of the pieces are all flattering , ' @entity0 explained			2
' all the waistbands are elastic , which i prefer			0
essentially , the collection is based around my butt ... ' we do n't want to limit who buys the collection based on sizing ; the cuts will look good on everyone			0
' we want our shoppers to be part of the process with us			0
so give us feedback and tell us what 's working on your body			0
just because it works on my butt does n't mean it works for everyone			0

the size eight 22 - year - old has her own fashion label , @entity0 x @entity30 , which is aimed at women who are ' average sized '
