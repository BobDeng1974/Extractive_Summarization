@entity0 held talks with a @entity3 human rights investigator for first the first time in ten years , in a charm offensive designed to nullify attempts to prosecute its leaders for crimes against civilians			1
@entity3 human rights chief @entity11 said he was surprised and gratified @entity0 officials had raised the possibility of allowing him to visit their country during their meeting			1
but he said the prospect of such a trip remains deeply uncertain because leader @entity19 was insisting he drop moves in a @entity3 resolution to prosecute the country in the @entity23 over its human rights record			1
@entity11 said he conveyed @entity0 's message to the @entity54 and @entity55 , which drafted the resolution			2
he said he would not be involved in any further discussions between the parties on the issue			0
@entity11 met with four @entity0 officials on monday , the first such encounter since the office of special rapporteur for human rights in @entity0 was created 10 years ago			1
he said he was surprised when the officials mentioned the possibility of a visit , which would be a breakthrough in international efforts to have a first - hand look at the way the deeply impoverished but nuclear - armed country treats its citizens			0
he said the @entity0 also floated the possibility of a visit by the @entity3 high commissioner for human rights			1
' it 's quite a big jump for @entity0 , ' @entity11 said at a news conference			2
' it 's a very pragmatic step they are taking			0
' but @entity11 said the @entity0 made clear they want mention of the @entity23 dropped from the resolution ' so that they would be in a position to issue an invitation			1
' a @entity3 commission of inquiry warned leader @entity19 in a letter earlier this year that he may be held accountable for orchestrating widespread crimes against civilians the nonbinding resolution , which could be introduced to the @entity89 next month , would urge the @entity90 to consider referring @entity0 's situation to the @entity23 , as well as press for targeted sanctions			1
it does n't name names but a @entity3 commission of inquiry warned leader @entity19 in a letter earlier this year that he may be held accountable for orchestrating widespread crimes against civilians			1
@entity11 said the @entity0 were upset about the mention of @entity19 because ' it touches on the sanctity ' of the leader			1
an @entity54 spokesperson did not discount the possibility of addressing the @entity0 's concerns			2
' the objective of this text is to bring change to the human rights situation in the country , by which we mean real improvements on the ground , ' the spokesperson said			0
' it is with this objective in mind that the @entity54 and its co-sponsors will look at any proposals made by the @entity0			0
' a @entity55 official said the government in @entity122 has been made aware of the message conveyed by @entity124 ' but i can not predict whether the resolution will be modified or not			0
' a still from video reportedly showing a prisoner being abused by @entity0 officials			2
a @entity3 @entity44 report published in february detailed wide - ranging abuses , including the use of prison camps , torture , starvation and killings comparable to @entity52 - era atrocities the official said ' our policy is for now unchanged ' and @entity55 would continue seeking support from @entity3 members for the resolution			1
the officials both spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak on private discussions by name			0
@entity11 , who has been special rapporteur since 2010 , said it is ' out of question ' for the resolution to drop calls for officials to be held accountable for human rights atrocities but he spoke of the possibility of ' reformulating ' the language			2
when asked whether that could mean dropping direct mention of the @entity23 he said , ' it depends on how you formulate that			0
' the @entity163 has been on the defensive since the @entity3 commission of inquiry released a harshly critical report accusing the regime of running political prison camps with up to 120,000 people and sponsoring abductions of @entity172 , @entity55 and others			2
that report recommended that the @entity0 's situation be referred to the @entity23 , something @entity124 backed in the annual report he presented monday to the @entity89 's commission on human rights			1
even if the @entity90 were to take up the matter , @entity180 would likely veto any resolution that included a referral of its @entity0 ally to the @entity23			0
but the @entity0 have engaged in an unusually public diplomatic blitz to stop the idea from even reaching a vote			0
@entity188 , a @entity0 foreign ministry official in charge of human rights issues , told @entity192 on monday that no date has been fixed for a visit from @entity11 , but his country is looking for a ' new and objective report ' on @entity0 's human rights situation			1
' previous reports he has prepared have been based on rumors and fabrications , as well as distortions , ' he said			0
phones rang unanswered tuesday at @entity0 's @entity203 .			0
