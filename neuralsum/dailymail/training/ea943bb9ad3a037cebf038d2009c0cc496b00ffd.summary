@entity0 forward @entity1 has lifted the lid on his difficult time at @entity4			1
@entity5 , tipped as one of @entity9 football 's brightest prospects at the time , was signed from @entity0 by former @entity12 boss sir @entity11 in january 2013 for a fee believed to be around £ 15 million			1
but he was loaned straight back to the @entity0 for the remainder of the season and did not arrive at @entity16 until the following summer , by which time @entity11 had retired and been replaced by @entity18			1
@entity5 was signed by former @entity4 manager sir @entity11 for around £ 15m in january 2013 ' sir @entity11 obviously saw something in me and that 's why he brought me to @entity12			1
but i never got to be coached by him			0
i signed and by the time i came back ( from the loan spell at @entity0 ) , he had left			2
that was weird , ' @entity5 told @entity26 the forward was a peripheral figure under @entity18 , used sparingly and sometimes out of position			0
and the lack of first - team opportunities afforded to him , coupled with the stresses of moving to @entity34 alone , proved frustrating for the youngster			1
' i had a lot to deal with living on my own in @entity34			0
it was n't the best , ' he said , ' if you 're not playing , you 're not happy			0
' after failing to make an impact under @entity43 , @entity5 was loaned to @entity44 for the second half of last season			2
although life off the pitch improved at @entity51 , with one of @entity5 's brothers making the move to the @entity56 capital to keep him company , the forward 's form did not , as he contributed just one assist in 11 games			0
@entity5 found first - team opportunities hard to come by at @entity12 and has been loaned back to @entity0 @entity5 returned to @entity0 again at the start of this season on another loan deal and could yet rejoin the @entity0 permanently in the summer			1
the 22 - year - old has been given a new lease of life under @entity0 boss @entity66 and is working hard towards rediscovering the sort of of form that led @entity12 to sign him two years ago			2
for now , though , @entity5 remains focused simply on playing regular , first - team football and will leave any decisions on his future until the end of the season			1
' i 'm not ruling anything in or out			0
i 'm just going to play , ' he said			0
the 22 - year - old forward is working hard to rediscover the form that led @entity4 to sign him in the first place			0

@entity1 signed for @entity12 in 2013 for £ 15m
however , he was frustrated with the lack of first - team opportunities
@entity5 never got a chance to play under sir @entity11
the forward has been loaned out to @entity44 and @entity0
now , back at @entity0 until the end of the season , he wants to hit form
