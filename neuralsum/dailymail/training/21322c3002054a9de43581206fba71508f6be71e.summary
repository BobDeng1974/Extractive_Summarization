conservatives in the @entity1 got a powerful weapon on wednesday in the battle over whether they can pull the rug out from under president @entity7 's plan to mainstream millions of illegal immigrants into @entity11 life			1
@entity13 sen. @entity12 , the @entity15 ' top budget hawk , has unveiled a nov. 21 memo from the @entity17 ( @entity17 ) explaining that @entity18 can legally strip funding from @entity11 's immigration enforcement agency – including funds the agency raises on its own through fees it charges @entity11 and foreigners			1
that news will put fuel in the tank of right - wingers who want to paint @entity7 into a corner when the @entity15 controls both houses of @entity18 in january			1
citing ' @entity18 's constitutional power over the purse , ' the @entity17 – @entity35 's official nonpartisan research arm – instructed sessions that lawmakers can pick and choose what executive branch agencies can spend money on			1
' an agency is not free simply to disregard ' those orders , the memo read			0
that question had been left hanging in an internecine @entity15 feud that spilled out into news coverage and the blogosphere in the weeks since the midterm elections			0
sessions and other @entity1 conservatives argue in favor of ' de-funding ' @entity84 , a subagency of the @entity87 , in order to force an @entity7 administration retreat from what they term an ' amnesty ' for more than 5 million people living in the @entity11 illegally			0
moderates , led by @entity94 chair @entity49 of @entity95 , insist the gesture would be an empty one since the @entity97 could legally thumb its nose at @entity18 by self - funding the agency			1
@entity84 will print and distribute green cards and work authorization cards for the millions of immigrants likely to benefit from @entity7 's executive order , announced last week			1
those cards and other documents will cost money – arguably bringing in more than the agency needs – even if congressional @entity15 try to freeze it out			2
under construction : like the mid-restoration @entity109 itself , the shape of the next @entity18 – including the level of aggressiveness @entity15 leaders will employ against the @entity97 – is still taking shape not far enough : @entity7 was heckled in @entity116 on tuesday by @entity118 activists who insisted he had n't done enough @entity49 cautioned last thursday , after @entity7 unveiled his unprecedented immigration plan , that since ' @entity18 does not appropriate funds for any of [ @entity84 's ] operations ... the @entity121 process can not be used to " de-fund " the agency			1
' @entity7 's immigration bureaucracy , he argued , ' has the ability to continue to collect and use fees to continue current operations , and to expand operations as under a new executive order , without needing legislative approval			1
' @entity49 , multiple @entity35 sources confirmed wednesday , is focused on passing a so - called ' omnibus ' budget bill by december 11 when the current agreement funding the federal government expires – and has ignored pleas from his right to force - feed the @entity97 a series of piecemeal bills instead			2
while the normal appropriations procedure makes it difficult to seize control of fees that an agency like @entity84 might use to plot its own course , a different maneuver – writing a short piece of legislation – would unlock what @entity18 needs			0
the @entity17 sided with @entity12			0
even if @entity84 gets no money from @entity18 at all , the memo states , ' the funds available to the agency through fee collections would be subject to the same potential restrictions imposed by @entity18			0
' ' importantly , ' @entity17 adds , ' amounts received as fees by federal agencies must still be appropriated by @entity18 to that agency in order to be available for obligation or expenditure by the agency			0
' confused ? a senior aide to a conservative @entity15 @entity94 member told @entity165 on wednesday that ' this analysis means @entity49 is way off - base			2
' ' this is no different from entrance fees charged by the @entity171 , ' he said			1
' @entity18 can certainly tell the @entity172 what it can and ca n't do with that money			2
park rangers ca n't just stick their tongue out at us and spend that money doing something @entity18 forbids , like giving tap - dance lessons to grizzly bears			1
' ' if we could stop that , we can stop this			0
' a second @entity97 aide said even if moderate @entity15 were n't sure they had the authority to stop @entity84 from printing green cards with its own money , ' they could just legislate that			1
' @entity190 : @entity7 's move to sidestep @entity18 with his immigration reform drew laughs from @entity194 , which depicted him pushing a favorite @entity196 icon down the @entity35 steps on the senate side , an aide close to the @entity199 told @entity165 that the @entity17 report ' should be the end of this technical debate			1
' ' the report clearly says @entity18 can use the appropriations process to deny the funds needed to implement the president 's illegal amnesty and work authorization program , ' the aide said			1
' the @entity15 made a promise to midterm voters to battle this amnesty and secure their livelihoods			0
this has become yet more imperative following confirmations that legalized populations will draw @entity218 and @entity219 checks from @entity11 families			0
' sessions seemed ready to fight all 12 rounds last thursday			0
' @entity224 should send the @entity1 a government funding bill which ensures no funds can be spent for this unlawful purpose , ' he said nov. 20			2
on wednesday his office sent @entity165 a statement insisting that ' the suggestion that the @entity97 can implement any unlawful and unconstitutional act so long as it pays for it with assessed fees is just plain wrong			0
' ' there is no question that @entity18 has the power to block this expenditure and no doubt that it can be done , ' he said			0
even a potential lawsuit , @entity17 wrote , would likely tilt in favor of lawmakers who want to tie @entity7 's hands			2
a court ' could find ' that a congressional restriction on homeland security spending ' reached activities or agencies that were entirely fee - funded , ' according to the report .			0

@entity15 civil *war* broke out after @entity7 's nov. 20 ' amnesty ' speech over whether the @entity15 can stop the @entity97 from issuing green cards and work *permits*
@entity18 's official fact - checkers now say the new @entity15 *majority* on @entity35 can legally pull the plug
at issue is whether immigration authorities can do whatever they want with fees they collect from immigrants , both legal and illegal
one congressional aide proposed a *hypothetical* situation where the @entity172 *diverted* @entity171 entrance fees to give ' tap - dance lessons to grizzly bears '
' if we could stop that , we can stop this , ' the *staffer* insisted
