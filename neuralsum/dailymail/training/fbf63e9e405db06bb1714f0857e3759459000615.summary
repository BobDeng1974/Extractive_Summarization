unsettling video footage has given the first look into the massive sinkhole that opened up beneath a @entity4 home and swallowed a man from his bed in february			1
@entity8 , 37 , was sucked into the sinkhole while he slept in his family home in @entity11 and when his brother , @entity12 , jumped in the hole to try to save him , he was nowhere to be seen			1
footage taken by a contractor who examined the hole shortly before the home was demolished has now been released by the county , and shows that every piece of furniture has vanished			1
most bizarre is how the ground has completely given way - revealing the brown dirt beneath - yet hats , high - visibility jackets and shelves remain on the wall above where @entity8 's bed once was			1
the house has now been torn down and the family hopes to set up a memorial at the site			1
@entity45 left their properties and the county has said that the houses on each side of the sinkhole house will have to be condemned , @entity44 reported			1
' the results of the geophysical tests concluded that the subsurface soils were unstable as subsidence activity is evidenced at each site , ' county administrator @entity51 said			2
he added that residents should speak with engineers before they try to collect their belongings			2
bizarre : hats are still hanging on a doorknob in the bedroom in @entity11 , @entity4 yet the ground beneath the wall has completely vanished			1
the freak accident claimed the life of 37 - year - old @entity8 , right gone : this video still shows the hanging hats , left , above the massive hole in the ground			1
the video was taken by a contractor shortly before the home was demolished @entity8 , 37 , was in his bedroom in @entity11 - a suburb of 8,000 people 15 miles east of downtown @entity77 - when the earth opened up on the night of february 28			1
five others in the house escaped unharmed			1
@entity81 , 36 , recalled how he desperately tried to pull his brother , @entity82 , from the rubble as he heard his screams for help			2
' i ran in there and heard somebody screaming , my brother screaming , and i ran in there , ' he told my @entity91			2
' and all i see is this big hole			1
all i see is the top of his bed			2
i did n't see anything else , so i jumped in the hole and tried getting him out			1
hidden : the hole was largely hidden beneath the home but was seen as the property was demolished crushed : demolition experts watched as the @entity8 's home was destroyed three days after his death ' the floor was still giving in and the dirt was still going down , but i did n't care			1
i wanted to save my brother			2
i could hear him screaming for me , hollering for me			0
i could n't do nothing			0
' @entity12 had tried to save his brother when he heard him screaming , but was unable to reach him			0
a deputy pulled @entity12 out of the sinkhole , and likely saved his life			1
following the tragedy , @entity81 said he believed the rescue teams should not have given up so soon			0
' i feel like they could have tried harder to get my brother out of there , ' he said			0
' that was my brother			0
no one is even talking about what my mom and dad are going through			0
they do n't want to be on camera			0
my mom and dad are going through hell right now			0
' break down : @entity81 , right , told reporters that not enough was done to get his brother @entity82 out of a sinkhole during an emotional interview as the family house was demolished remembered : @entity81 set up a makeshift memorial for his brother before demolition began the 20 - foot - wide opening of the sinkhole was almost covered by the house , and rescuers said there were no signs of life after the hole opened			1
experts say thousands of sinkholes erupt yearly in @entity4 because of the state 's unique geography , though most are small and deaths rarely occur			2
' there 's hardly a place in @entity4 that 's immune to sinkholes , ' said @entity150 , who owns a geology consulting company			2
' there 's no way of ever predicting where a sinkhole is going to occur			1
' watch out : @entity4 , @entity156 , @entity157 , @entity158 , @entity159 , @entity160 , and @entity161 are the states most affected by sinkholes , according to the @entity164 a sinkhole is a hole that opens up suddenly in the ground			1
they mostly occur because of erosion or underground water that gathers naturally or due to man - made activities			0
when this water dissolves the foundation beneath the surface layer , spaces and caverns develop underground			0
@entity178 , carbonate rock , and salt beds are particular vulnerable to this erosion			0
meanwhile , the top layer of @entity181 usually stays intact			0
when the dissolving area beneath the surface becomes too large , the surface suddenly gives way			0
according to the @entity164 , @entity4 , @entity156 , @entity157 , @entity158 , @entity159 , @entity160 , and @entity161 are the states most affected by sinkholes			0
while they often occur from natural causes , sinkholes can be man - made and caused by human activity			0
groundwater pumping and construction are the most likely culprits			0
they can also occur when water drainage systems are changed			0
