ahead of @entity2 's crucial @entity1 semi-final against @entity4 in @entity5 , @entity0 takes a closer look at @entity8 's side			1
player of the tournament : @entity11 ( 5 games , 4 goals ) the poster boy of this @entity1 has almost single - handedly united a nation fractured by social division and sent belief coursing through the veins of the country			1
the @entity21 to @entity23 ’s @entity22 at @entity24 , @entity11 has been liberated by responsibility , committing opponents , scoring goals and elevating @entity2 out of the rut of mediocrity that has enveloped his fellow attackers @entity30 and @entity33			2
the guttural release , hair bouncing , veins bulging and eyes boggling as he charged towards the @entity61 support , kung - fu kicking the corner flag , was the moment of this @entity1			0
technique : @entity45 watches his powerful free - kick fly towards @entity66 's goal to put @entity2 2 - 0 ahead lowlight : underhand tactics against @entity46 perhaps our vision of the @entity61 sides of years gone by is a touch romantic , but it has been a shame to see talented , dynamic talent like @entity75 's @entity74 reduced to slicing the legs off talents such as @entity46 ’s @entity78			1
@entity2 ’s competitive courage and determination has been compelling to watch but the impressions of @entity1 villains like @entity83 and @entity84 have been dispiriting , to say the least			0
@entity85 : @entity75 midfielder @entity74 was guilty of regularly fouling @entity46 's @entity78 best goal : @entity45 v @entity46 , 2 - 1 , quarter - final , @entity88 how has the boss performed ? @entity8 has declared that @entity2 are two steps from heaven and he will be elevated to @entity93 - like status if he can guide his country to a second @entity1 triumph , after previously managing them to glory in 2002			1
his dark pragmatism has not been well - received by all observers but in @entity2 , the natives are riding a tidal wave of emotion and unity as @entity8 ’s cool exterior betrays the frenzied but effective performances of his players			2
repeat performance ? @entity8 is on the verge of leading @entity2 to a second world up triumph top scorer : @entity11 – 4 goals killer stat : @entity2 are unbeaten in competitive football ( not including friendlies ) for 39 years on home soil			1
the run stretches back to a defeat by @entity119 in 1975 in the @entity120			0
results in 9pm kick - offs : played three , won three , defeating @entity41 , @entity123 and @entity46			0
@entity125 v @entity124 : @entity125 : @entity2 won all three games against @entity41 , @entity123 and @entity46 on @entity124 but they have proved less successful on the @entity125 , drawing 0 - 0 win @entity127 and only defeating @entity128 in the first knockout round on penalty kicks			2
@entity131 to semi-finals : comfortable progress through @entity134 with victories over @entity41 and @entity123 and a draw against @entity127 , before seeing off @entity138 rivals @entity128 and @entity46 in the final 16 and quarter - finals			1
@entity141 ranking : 3 likely line - up : @entity143 ; @entity144 , @entity145 , @entity45 , @entity146 ; @entity147 , @entity148 ; @entity30 , @entity149 , @entity35 ; @entity33 @entity1 pedigree : five time winners in @entity151 in 1958 , @entity128 in 1962 , @entity127 in 1970 , @entity152 in 1994 and @entity153 in 2002			0
finalists in the last @entity1 in @entity2 in 1950 , where they were defeated by @entity155			0
semi-finalists in 1938 , 1974 , 1978			0

@entity11 was *undoubtedly* @entity2 's player of the tournament before *injury* struck against @entity46
the @entity24 will miss the remainder of the tournament with a broken bone in his back
@entity45 's long - range free - kick against @entity170 's side is the @entity2 's most impressive goal so far
@entity2 were guilty of playing rough during their 2 - 1 quarter - final victory
@entity8 is closing in on his second @entity1 triumph
@entity2 play @entity4 in @entity5 on *tuesday*
