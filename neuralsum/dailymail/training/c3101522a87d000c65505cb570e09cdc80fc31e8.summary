by @entity0 , mail online deputy political editor retired @entity3 get £ 600 - a - year less than those in @entity5 because of @entity7 red tape strangling people 's pension pots , research has revealed			1
@entity10 in the @entity3 can expect a pay out of around £ 2,850 a year from a £ 50,000 retirement pot. but in the @entity15 , pensioners with the same size nest egg will get £ 3,450			1
pension experts say this £ 50 - a - month gulf is because @entity7 financial regulation is twice as strict as that in the @entity15			1
a @entity3 pensioner with a £ 50,000 retirement pot would receive £ 2,850 - a - year , but in the @entity5 a pensioner with the same size nest egg would get £ 3,450 @entity7 rules force @entity3 insurance companies to hold twice as much cash in reserve compared to those in the @entity5 - driving down the amount they can pay out in annuities to pensioners			1
because the regulation forces shareholders in @entity3 pension companies to put more cash on the line as an insurance policy , the shareholders demand more profit in return - eating in to people 's retirement incomes			1
@entity3 insurers demand a profit margin of around 20 per cent on annuities			2
in the @entity5 meanwhile , insurers generally look for a return of just 10 per cent			2
an annuity is what most people in the @entity3 choose to spend their pension savings on at retirement			1
pensioners hand over your pension fund to an insurer - who have to pay back a guaranteed income for life in return			1
in 2013 around 400,000 annuities were sold worth £ 12billion			2
insurers generally work on the assumption they will have to pay a 65 - year - old a pension until they are 90			2
from a retirement pot of £ 100,000 , insurers work out that they will make around £ 55,000 - £ 60,000 by investing this cash over 25 years			1
from this , pensioners will get an annual income of around £ 5,700 - £ 5,900 — which works out at up to £ 148,000 over 25 years			1
this means £ 12,000 is left over			0
of this , £ 5,500 goes on overheads and middle men - with the remaining £ 6,500 in profit for the insurance company			0
but insurance companies will make much more than £ 6,500 on average - because most people do n't live until they are 90			0
a healthy 65 - year - old is likely to live until they 're 84 , official figures show			0
this effectively gives insurers six years of extra profit			0
someone who passes away at 84 could receive as little as £ 94,000 from their £ 100,000 retirement pot , leaving insurers with around £ 30,000 in profits , according to experts			1
new rules come into force next year which give pensioners much more freedom over how they spend their pension pots			1
people should even be free to blow their pensions on buying a @entity93 if they want to , pensions minister @entity94 has said			0
the centrepiece of the government 's @entity96 was a plan to allow people to withdraw their pension pot as a cash lump sum instead of investing in a pension plan , which ministers claim will give people choice to spend their money how they wish			2
in the @entity5 peoples have total freedom on how to spend their pension savings - forcing annuity providers to pay out more to encourage pensioners to choose their product			1
in the @entity3 the best annuity rate was £ 5,700 a year for every £ 100,000 invested			1
but in the @entity5 , pensioners could get $ 6,900 a year for $ 100,000 invested			1
this is some 20 per cent more paid to pensioners in the @entity5 than in the @entity3			1
@entity117 at @entity118 said : ' regulators need to explain to the public why they build in so much higher " health & safety " requirements to @entity3 at pensioners ' expense compared to the @entity5			1
' from april 2015 , pensioners can vote with their wallet and at these poor prices , i can not see many choosing to buy annuities			0
' pensions minister @entity94 said : ' for many years consumers have felt that they were not getting good value from their annuities			0
' but from next april people will be free to do what they want with their pension pot. ' no one will be forced to buy an annuity and if someone thinks they can get a better return through an alternative way of using their pension pot then this government will not stand in their way			2
' pensions minister @entity94 has introduced new rules to give pensioners more freedom over how they spend their retirement savings former @entity151 pensions adviser dr @entity152 warned told @entity153 that @entity3 pensioners were losing out			1
former saga chief dr @entity152 said : ' @entity3 pensioners are being royally ripped off			1
in the @entity5 you can choose whether you want to buy an annuity or not			2
but companies here have a captive audience because they have to buy an annuity			0
' i think it is essential that people take advice before looking into an annuity and that they shop around			0
the evidence is clear when you look other countries - they are much better rates			0
' @entity173 ’s shadow pensions minister @entity172 mp added : ' annuities as they stand do not work for the majority of savers – low and middle income savers with smaller pension pots			2
' we support more options for savers , but the quality of financial guidance savers receive is paramount			0
' @entity184 promised and must deliver high quality impartial face to face guidance for the hundreds of thousands of savers who retire annually			0
the devil is in the detail when it comes to the chancellor ’s @entity191			0
' annuity rates have been on the wane for the past 15 years and are now at an all - time low what is an annuity ? if you belong to a non-final salary pension scheme , by the time you retire you will have built up a lump sum in your personal pension pot. this may be used to buy an annuity from an insurance firm , which guarantees a specified annual income for the rest of your life			2
how much you receive is based on life expectancy and government interest rates			0
what can i expect to get ? someone aged 65 with a £ 50,000 pot can expect around £ 2,850 a year			1
but in the @entity15 , pensioners with the same amount will get £ 3,450			1
why are payments so poor ? annuity rates have fallen steadily for the past 15 years because of increased life expectancy			0
the longer we live , the longer our pension pots will have to support us			0
more recently the @entity223 ’s policy of quantitative easing has led to a drop in the interest paid on government bonds			0
because insurers use the yield on these bonds to set annuity rates , pension payouts have fallen steeply			0
what types of annuity are there ? the simplest , and most common , offers a fixed income for life , with no inflation proofing and no provision for a surviving spouse			0
once you take an annuity your entire pension pot is gone			2
if you die a year later , the income stops and your family will not get access to savings you had			2
annuities for the chronically sick and smokers can be up to 40 per cent higher than normal because they have shorter life expectancies .			0

*excessive* @entity7 ' financial health and safety ' is hitting @entity3 pension incomes
with £ 50,000 retirement pot , @entity3 pensioners can expect £ 2,850 a year
but pensioners in the @entity5 can expect a retirement income of £ 3,450
