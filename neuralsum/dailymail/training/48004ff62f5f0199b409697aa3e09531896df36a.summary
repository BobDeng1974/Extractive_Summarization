@entity0 will become the latest player to wear the iconic @entity3 no 7 shirt when he lines up for his debut at @entity6 's @entity5 on saturday lunchtime			1
we are all aware of the legends who have worn this number down the years - @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity12			0
but what about those who wore the shirt but did n't live so long in the memory ? who took on the legend but were n't able to live up to expectations ? @entity23 takes a look back			0
part of @entity35 's promising team in the late seventies , he suffered @entity38 final heartache in 1976 when @entity3 were beaten by second division @entity39 at @entity40			1
@entity28 made amends 12 months later , ending @entity43 's treble ambitions in a 2 - 1 win and in all he made 322 league appearances , scoring 53 times			2
hindered by knee problems , @entity28 was forced to retire in october 1983 , at the age of just 28 , before forging a long managerial career			2
underachiever ? @entity28 was good at @entity3 but perhaps could have been more @entity51 ( @entity3 1977 - 1983 ) @entity52 - born utility player @entity51 played in 107 matches for @entity3 during his half a dozen years at @entity54 yet was never able to hold down a first - team place			1
he was n't especially favoured by manager @entity56 and even less so by his successor @entity57 , who brought in the likes of @entity14			1
@entity51 played for @entity3 during a relatively barren spell in their history for silverware but he did collect an @entity38 winners ' medal in 1983 as an unused substitute in the final with @entity66			1
he was moved on to @entity67 the same year and later played for @entity68 and @entity69			0
he won 18 caps for the @entity71			0
sent to @entity67 : @entity51 was never really favoured by his managers at @entity54 @entity73 ( @entity3 1988 - 1991 ) squad numbers officially came along with the inception of the @entity76 in 1992 , but @entity73 wore the no 7 shirt during his three years at @entity54 in the early @entity78 years			1
@entity3 had finished second in the @entity79 the season before midfielder @entity73 arrived and @entity78 believed the former @entity82 man would help them win the title			1
it did n't quite transpire that way , with @entity73 scoring just three goals in 30 appearances for the club			2
he was certainly not loved by the fans and regularly crops up in debates about their worst - ever players			0
@entity78 admitted many years later that @entity73 was his worst signing , saying : ' i only paid Â£ 170,000 but still get condemned for it			2
' given this , it 's remarkable @entity73 clung on to the club 's payroll until the summer of 1991 before being released			0
trouble at @entity99 : @entity73 ( right ) is often mentioned when @entity3 fans discuss their worst ever players @entity102 ( @entity3 1993 - 1995 ) a member of the class of ' 92 alongside @entity106 , @entity16 , @entity107 , @entity108 et al , @entity103 was a player with real pace and promise			1
but he was unable to force his way past @entity114 @entity113 in an era of success for @entity3 and he only made a handful of first - team appearances			2
in the end , @entity103 moved on to @entity120 , part of the deal that brought striker @entity123 to @entity54			0
he later went on to play for @entity124 , @entity125 and @entity126 among others and won 86 caps for his country			0
struggle : @entity102 ( left ) could not forge a career for himself on @entity3 's right wing @entity133 ( @entity3 2009 - 2012 ) it 's fair to say that @entity78 's offer to join @entity3 came as a big surprise to @entity133 , who was considered well past his best and prone to injuries			1
handed the no 7 shirt , @entity133 spent three years at @entity3 , making 52 appearances and scoring 17 times			1
he found it hard to dislodge the likes of @entity144 and @entity145 from the forward line and any progress seemed to be checked by yet another injury setback			0
highlights included a last - minute winner against @entity151 and a @entity153 hat - trick away to @entity154			0
injury hit : @entity133 ( right ) spent a lot of his time at @entity54 on the sidelines @entity159 ( @entity3 2009 - present ) after @entity133 's departure , the no 7 shirt was passed on the @entity162 , who was entering his fourth season with the club			1
the change in number led to an inconsistent season with the @entity170 winger finding the net only once in 40 games , a decrease from his previous seasons			0
he duly switched back to his more familiar no 25 shirt the following year though it 's debatable whether his form has actually improved for the change			0
he 's got your number : @entity162 is rebuked by @entity181 during his unsuccessful spell wearing seven one of the best : @entity3 were in seventh heaven with @entity12 big success : @entity3 hit the jackpot with @entity15 when he pulled on the famous no 7 jersey			2

@entity28 's @entity3 career was *curtailed* by injury
@entity51 was never trusted by @entity56 or @entity57
@entity73 's name is mentioned in the ' worst @entity3 players ' debate
@entity102 could n't force his way into the first team
@entity133 spent a lot of time on the sidelines at @entity54
@entity159 *reverted* back to @entity204 after flopping as no 7
