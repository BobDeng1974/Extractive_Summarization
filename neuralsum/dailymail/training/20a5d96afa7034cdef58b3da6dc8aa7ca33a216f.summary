@entity25 said : ' shearing an alpaca is not a doddle			1
it takes a long time to learn how to do it properly			2
' it takes two people to secure one to a board			2
we then fleece it and check their teeth , do their nails and give them any injections they are due			0
' the whole job takes between 10 and 20 minutes per alpaca , but with the relatively low numbers involved it ’s not about speed			1
' it ’s more important that we do a good job for the owner and be as gentle as possible with the alpaca			0
you have to keep the alpacas calm during the shearing process			0
' it ’s still only early june and i have already clipped over 150 alpacas			0
that wo n’t sound much to a sheep shearer , but a lot of the jobs i do are in twos and threes , with a lot of miles to cover in - between			0
