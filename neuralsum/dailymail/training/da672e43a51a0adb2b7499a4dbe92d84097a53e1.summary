by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 published : 18:06 est , 20 march 2012 updated : 18:41 est , 21 march 2012 stamp duty on all homes that cost more than £ 2million will soar to seven per cent from tonight , @entity3 announced in a tax grab on the wealthy			1
a new 15 per cent tax will also be imposed on all properties over £ 2million which are bought via a company in an attempt to close a loophole			1
mr @entity3 said the clampdown on stamp duty avoidance will help raise five times more than the 50p tax which ' may raise nothing at all '			1
the chancellor added that the government will consult on a ' mansion tax ' - an annual charge on properties worth at least £ 2million - in a concession to the @entity23 new rate : homes such as these will be subject to the new rate			1
the move comes just 12 months after the introduction of a 5 per cent band on homes bought for more than £ 1m the seven per cent tax will mean a minimum tax contribution of £ 140,000 by someone buying a residential house costing £ 2m or more			1
the move comes just 12 months after the introduction of a 5 per cent band on homes bought for more than £ 1m			2
the new rate will allow the government to milk high - end wealth particularly in expensive enclaves of @entity41 , appealing to ' squeezed middle ' voters			0
however , estate agents have warned the raid on £ 2million plus homes could hit all homeowners and buyers by triggering a slowdown in the areas of the property market which have been vital to supporting prices			1
they said the chancellor risks ' killing the goose that lays the golden egg ' at a time when much of the housing market remains flat elsewhere			1
mr @entity3 told the @entity60 that he was determined to crackdown on property tax avoidance - and close a loophole that has allowed wealthy homeowners to dodge stamp duty by placing their properties in overseas tax shelters			1
clampdown : mr @entity3 unveiled a crackdown on @entity70 tax avoidance in his budget today the average asking price in one exclusive corner of @entity41 , the @entity74 , hit £ 2m for the first time this week			1
a decade ago , the average asking price in the area was just £ 650,000			0
those paying the new rate of stamp duty now face bills of at least £ 140,000 if the new 7 % rate is implemented			1
before 1997 they would have paid little more than £ 20,000 because stamp duty was a flat 1 per cent			1
there are thought to be around 80,000 homes in @entity87 worth £ 2million or more			1
the price of homes such as those in @entity41 's most expensive boroughs has shot up in recent years , partly due to an influx of foreign wealth			0
throughout the capital , average prices were typically £ 455,159 , up 7.3 % year - on - year			0
overall @entity87 is set for a house price boom , a @entity97 expert predicted yesterday			0
demand will rise as a result of our ageing population , an influx of immigrants and a record low in the number of new houses being built			0
more than £ 100billion of property in central @entity41 alone has been placed offshore beyond the reach of the taxman , costing the nation billions in lost revenue			0
the chancellor said : ' if you buy a property in @entity87 that is used for residential purposes , then we will expect stamp duty to be paid			2
that is the clear intention of @entity120			0
' i will not hesitate to move swiftly , without notice and retrospectively if inappropriate ways around these new rules are found			0
' he added : ' it is fair when money is tight , and so many families could do with help , that those buying the most expensive homes contribute more			0
' from midnight tonight , we will introduce a new stamp duty land tax rate of 7 per cent on properties worth more than £ 2 million			1
' a @entity137 inventory of 18,700 title deeds shows that in some areas of @entity41 more than one in 20 properties are owned offshore			0
the dodge has spread across the country , with @entity144 , @entity145 , @entity146 and even @entity147 among the locations for properties held in tax havens			0
the schemes enable the rich to avoid stamp duty , as long as they are not resident or domiciled here for tax			2
their heirs also avoid inheritance tax , charged at 40 per cent			0
experts say the loophole is cheating the @entity160 out of up to £ 500million a year in stamp duty and as much as £ 1.3billion in inheritance tax			1
mr @entity3 said that the crackdown on avoidance and new taxes on the wealthy would raise five times more than the 50p tax which brought in just £ 1bn a year			1
it is being replaced with a 45p tax			0
he said : ' no chancellor can justify a tax rate that damages our economy and raises next to nothing			0
it is as simple as that			0
' and thanks to the other new taxes on the rich i 've announced today , we 'll be getting five times more money each and every year from the wealthiest in our society			2
' so the richest pay more			0
' today 's move will avoid a costly general revaluation of homes across the country that would have been required if the @entity23 's ' mansion tax ' or annual levy was implemented			2
@entity187 , chief executive of estate agent @entity188 and @entity189 , said the new stamp duty band could hit the property market at all levels			1
' not only will this policy disproportionately target @entity41 , where house prices are in a league of their own , it risks killing the goose that lays the golden egg			1
' with the property market still far from healthy , we need to see the government supporting activity at all levels , rather adding yet another tax burden			2
' @entity41 homes have been vital in keeping average prices up , with the capital often viewed as the most ' healthy ' and stable area at a time when the housing market generally remains weak and patchy			0
statistics from the @entity137 show that the new top rate of stamp duty will overwhelmingly hit @entity41 buyers			2
in november – the latest month for which figures are available – 121 homes were bought for more than £ 2million in @entity216 and @entity217 and 98 of these were in @entity41			2
the thresholds : how @entity220 ( @entity220 ) hits housebuyers money raised by the new stamp duty level will be used to plug the £ 3bn gap in public finances as the chancellor also announces a rise in the income tax base threshold to £ 9,205			1
mr @entity3 ’s stamp duty shake - up arrives just a few days before first - time buyers lose a generous exemption from the tax			1
the two - year holiday , which was introduced by @entity235 ’s @entity234 in his final budget , covered properties worth up to £ 250,000			2
the 7 per cent stamp duty band is a watered - down version of @entity23 plans for a mansion tax – pushed by business secretary @entity242 yesterday			1
the @entity243 said the government had missed an opportunity to completely overhaul the ' outdated ' stamp duty system , a tax which is seen as causing distortions in the market			1
@entity243 president @entity250 said : ' to reinvigorate this struggling market will require specific stimulus across the entire housing spectrum to help people buy and sell homes , not further penalties on those able to do so			0
' former @entity243 president @entity258 said every homeowner would be hit by the new top - end tax , with 70 per cent of first - time buyers relying on the progression of a ' chain ' of sales			0
he said : ' higher stamp duty always results in property price pressure , in this scenario there is little doubt that prices will fall across the board			2
some may think ‘ great ’ , but mortgage lenders will not - they rely on the expectation of a gentle long - term rise to safeguard their loans			0
' mr @entity258 predicted that lenders would generally start demanding higher deposits to protect themselves if prices dipped .			0
