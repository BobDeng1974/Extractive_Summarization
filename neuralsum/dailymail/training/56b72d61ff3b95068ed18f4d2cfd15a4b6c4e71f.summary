by @entity0 published : 07:16 est , 23 october 2013 updated : 02:13 est , 24 october 2013 last night , @entity2 's ceo took to the stage ahead of the firm 's latest @entity5 announcement and declared the tech giant recently sold its 170 millionth tablet computer			1
the announcement was accompanied by a simple looking line chart plotting the steady growth in @entity5 sales since the first model was unveiled back in 2010			2
yet , news site @entity14 took the chart and compared it with official sales figures to discover that not only is the chart ' misleading ' , it 's been created in a way that covers up the firm 's latest sales drop			1
@entity23 - based journalist @entity22 recreated the @entity2 chart , pictured , using official sales figures and found the original , simplified version was ' misleading '			1
the pink line plots the actual cumulative sales , based on these figures , while the grey line is @entity2 's interpretation according to journalist @entity22 : ' while that is a nice smooth curve , it has little resemblance to the underlying data			1
@entity2 ’s plot shows cumulative @entity5 sales accelerating more slowly and more exponentially than in reality			1
' @entity22 plotted the official quarterly sales figures as bars along the x-axis , and used these to produce a more accurate cumulative sales line			0
this was placed over the top of the original @entity2 chart to highlight the difference			2
by showing the difference , @entity22 was able to determine that at various points , the gap was wide enough to ' represent nearly 30 million units ' , which he claims creates a cumulative sales difference of around a third			0
similarly , figures in the second and third quarter of this year show a drop in sales - which is likely to be due to the fact a new @entity5 was set to launch - yet the chart does n't accurately reflect this			1
@entity2 's ceo @entity63 , pictured , used the chart shown here to announce the firm recently sold its 170 millionth tablet computer			1
according to @entity63 , @entity5 now make up 81 per cent of tablet usage while competitor tablets combined make up just 19 per cent @entity22 ran a similar comparison when @entity2 announced its latest iphones in september , and discovered a similar trend			1
he does highlight , however , that @entity2 has n't overplayed the sales all the way through the chart , adding that although the distances between the labels are the same above 30 million , the gap between zero and 30 million is smaller			2
by creating this smaller gap , it gives the appearance of lower sales at the start of the first quarter			0
also , for context , cumulative sales and quarterly sales are n't the same thing			0
cumulative sales are , as its name suggests , a cumulative , overall view of all @entity5 sales since the first model was launched			2
whereas quarterly sales look at specific sales over a three - month period so will reflect positive or negative growth depending on the time of year and other market considerations , such as new product announcements			0
additionally , @entity2 is the first tablet maker to hit the 170 million - mark - a figure that is accurate - and @entity5 are said to account for 81 per cent of tablet usage			1
competitor tablets combined make up just 19 per cent			0
new version : @entity2 's new @entity106 , right , is the fifth 9.7 - inch model to be sold by the @entity107 - firm			1
it is 43 per cent thinner than the previous model and has a @entity111 camera			0
the new @entity112 , left , has a 7.9 - inch retina display and 10 hours battery life @entity2 's new @entity106 is the fifth - generation 9.7 - inch tablet to be sold by the @entity107 - firm and is 43 per cent thinner than the previous model			2
it has a @entity111 camera and dual microphones for the first time and will be available in mid-december in four colours - silver , white , ' space grey ' and black			0
prices start at $ 499 for a @entity123 model with @entity125 prices starting at £ 399			0
@entity2 also unveiled a new @entity112 with a new high resolution 7.9inch retina display , which also has the new @entity129 chip from the @entity130			0
it features 10 hours of battery life , improved @entity132 and and is available in silver , white , space grey and black , contrary to rumours that suggested it would come in a rainbow of colours like the @entity139 .			0

@entity2 announced at the event the firm recently sold its 170 millionth @entity5
ceo @entity63 showed a simplified chart to show this rise in sales
news site @entity14 has recreated the chart to accurately reflect the figures
it calls @entity63 's chart ' misleading ' claiming it hides recent drops in sales
