by @entity0 @entity0 competed in 152 @entity2 races over 10 years			2
he won five times , including the @entity4 for @entity5 , and scored 169 career points			1
after leaving the sport in 1985 , @entity0 has forged a successful media career , and today he writes for @entity9			2
ahead of the new season , which starts in @entity11 this weekend , @entity0 gives his verdict on who he thinks will win the title , @entity16 's reliability woes , and why his former team @entity5 must finish in the top three this year			1
i have to say @entity19			2
they are the best prepared in terms of every element and they are quick			2
you are going to see a whole raft of development going on and they have got the budget to be able to do that			2
they have the money , the talent and the equipment			1
on the one hand you have got @entity35 who is very exciting , and on the other , you have @entity36 who drives more with his head			2
the fuel will be a factor so how you use , as to abuse your tyres , will be key , so i think @entity36 has the advantage on that level , and he probably shades it			2
for raw speed @entity35 might have him			0
in the spotlight : @entity35 and @entity36 will start as the favourites to win this year 's @entity2 title it comes down to the pace of development			0
@entity16 have got a fantastic car , but it suffers through overheating and their new engine parts			1
the way that it is packaged is , in part @entity59 's responsibility , but also the way @entity16 go about their engineering - they take it to the absolute limit			1
they are on the outside edge of that limit and as a consequence they will suffer from reliability problems			0
but they have got the capacity , in terms of people and budget , to turn it around very quickly			1
i would not be surprised if we see @entity16 returning to the front of the grid			1
they will be winning a race or more before mid-season , but whether they can recover and dominate as they did at the end of last year will be a very difficult challenge for them at this stage			1
all smiles : but @entity89 will face an uphill challenge to defend his @entity2 title this term under fire : but @entity0 expects @entity16 to win at least one race before mid-season @entity96 loves talking			1
he has become a media babe and he loves the camera and the microphone			0
even when the team is struggling he is still there talking away			2
i would hate to think he is becoming the story , instead of the messenger ... the difference is when reliability was an issue we did not have the global tv coverage that we do today			0
i do n't want to see a grand prix where potentially a number of cars will fail to qualify and will be outside the 107 per cent rule			0
i do n't want drivers either with a car which are incapable of running 20 laps before they retire , and even that may be optimistic			0
all this is a consequence of these very radical changes in regulations			0
maybe the people who made the new rules should have looked at it from a reliability perspective and not gone quite so radical as they have done			0
there are three fully - funded teams on the grid – @entity128 , @entity16 and @entity19			1
everybody else is funded by degrees , and some teams are still probably paying off the bills from 2012 let alone 2013 , so they will take longer to get over the reliability problems			0
you will then see the top three teams dominating			2
@entity5 will be amongst them , but it is a question of how competitive they are going to be			1
some teams may run slower than a @entity141 car and that would be a travesty			0
@entity144 seems to have found himself in a really good place			1
@entity146 have a competitive car			1
they have got the right engine and for a driver like @entity144 who has been somewhat subjugated with @entity151 and then @entity152			1
he is now at a team where he can be @entity144			1
contender : @entity144 may spring a surprise for @entity146 this season following his move from @entity128 the team are impressed with him and i am sure he will be delighted that the car is competitive			1
it does depend whether @entity146 can sustain it over the season and mix it with the top teams			1
i would also like to see @entity166 do to @entity167 what @entity168 did to me in 1980 – a young guy coming in and doing an outstanding job , taking on and maybe getting the better of his more established partner			0
dream team ? @entity174 and @entity152 they are both great drivers and great world champions , and they are both diametrically opposed in terms of personality			2
my only concern about @entity174 coming back is that @entity152 is such a good operator of every element so @entity174 will have to do a lot more than he was doing at @entity183 where in reality his then team - mate @entity184 , was not challenging him			1
i would have thought that @entity152 will be the dominant of the two drivers , but i can not underestimate @entity174			0
i did underestimate him when he came back at @entity183 , but the way he drives a racing car is a pleasure to watch , but he ca n't let the @entity128 garage be solely on @entity152 's side			0
the principle change at @entity5 is @entity193 returning in a controlling situation and part of the reason i am in @entity11 is to see a team i was a member of reformed			1
in effect we now have a @entity5 team that is in the same state as it was 32 years ago			1
i want to see what that team will do under @entity193 's leadership			1
but the problem @entity5 have , is that it is like an ocean liner – it is massive			1
it has its own momentum and it takes time to get that under control and to turn it			2
it ca n't be changed by one individual coming in , but what that individual will do is set into motion a whole new process , thinking , commitment and motivation			0
happy days : @entity167 shares a joke with former team - mate @entity35 in the @entity11 paddock @entity193 needs to ensure his team finish in the top three this year			1
he has to beat one of @entity16 , @entity128 and @entity19 and that is not going to be an easy task , but he has the advantage of that @entity19 engine			1
@entity167 is a thinking racing driver and he knows how to win a race			2
when it comes to conserving fuel and tyres , @entity167 has got that capacity and can win grands prix			0
he needs to make good use of the car in qualifying			0
i won my first grand prix in @entity242 at the circuit which was known then as the @entity244			0
now it is called the @entity244 and it is a shadow of its former magnificent self			0
there are a number of great tracks , but to me @entity252 is @entity2			0
it always has been and it always will be			0
i went to @entity254 for the inaugural @entity256 @entity255 and that was fantastic			0
it is a wonderful circuit and a fantastic venue , but from a pure spectacle perspective @entity260 wins hands down			0
i have no feeling for it one way or the other			0
it would n't have changed anything in 2013 , and would not have changed an awful lot in 2012			0
if it is going to attract a bigger audience and reinvigorate the end of the season than i am happy			2
i think there is more chance that we 'll get struck by lightning than it going down to the final race			1
in other words , no , it will be tied up before we get to @entity279			0
it will be a @entity19 - engine car which will win			2
we could have @entity144 as world champion but the most likely scenario is that it will be either @entity36 or @entity35			1
@entity0 was speaking to @entity283			0

*mercedes* are in the best shape . they have the money , talent and equipment
@entity16 have the budget to turn season around - they 'll be winning soon
@entity144 could spring a surprise for @entity146 this season
@entity5 chief @entity193 needs to ensure team finish in the top three
the championship will be *settled* before the final race in @entity302
