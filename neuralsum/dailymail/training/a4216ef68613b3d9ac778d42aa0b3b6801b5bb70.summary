by @entity0 published : 22:32 est , 4 march 2014 updated : 06:33 est , 5 march 2014 leading scientists have given their backing to introducing a 99 per cent accurate @entity5 test on the @entity6			1
non-invasive prenatal testing ( @entity8 ) can predict whether a baby has @entity5 as early as the 10th week of pregnancy			1
it also screens for the rare genetic conditions @entity13 's syndrome and @entity16 syndrome			1
@entity8 is currently only available in private hospitals , costing from around £ 300 , but is being considered for use on the @entity6 by the @entity19			1
leading scientists have given their backing to introducing a 99 per cent accurate @entity5 test on the @entity6 it will make a formal recommendation on whether to introduce the test once the results of a trial at @entity26 in @entity27 become known			1
in a new development , a scientific impact paper published by the @entity29 ( @entity29 ) supports giving the test to all women who want it in early pregnancy			0
at present , testing for @entity5 involves a combination of an ultrasound scan of the baby and a blood test for the mother			1
experts then estimate a woman 's chance of having a baby with @entity5 's			1
those found to be at high risk can opt for invasive tests - amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling			0
both carry a one in 100 risk of miscarriage			0
a formal decision whether to introduce the test will be made once the results of a trial at @entity26 are known the new @entity8 blood test detects a baby 's genetic material and does not carry any risk of miscarriage like the invasive tests			2
professor @entity60 , consultant in foetal medicine at the @entity62 and author of the scientific impact paper , said : ' this is the most exciting development in pregnancy care in many years			0
' the new test is so accurate that the number of women who will need invasive tests is going to fall very dramatically while still informing those who wish to know about chromosomal abnormalities			0
' the test is not yet available on the @entity6 but we think it will become a primary screening tool for all women who wish to know about foetal chromosomal abnormalities			2
' advantages of the test include its high accuracy rate ( over 99 % ) and ability to avoid invasive tests			0
however the experts said one disadvantage is that pregnant women may occasionally be informed of findings of uncertain significance , such as when there is a discrepancy between the chromosomal make - up of the cells in the placenta and the cells in the baby			2
dr @entity92 , chair of the @entity29 's scientific advisory committee , said : ' the potential for this technology is exciting and will provide much more accurate results for pregnant women			0
' however , it is important that there are resources and training for health professionals offering this testing and an emphasis on discussions with the pregnant woman before the test about the implications of the results			0
' about 750 babies with @entity5 are born in the @entity110 each year .			2
