' but if your child gets sick and gets my child sick and my child dies , then your action has harmed my child			0
' mr @entity8 said at a parents meeting at his daughter 's school that a staff member told parents not to send peanut products to school , since a child or children had an allergy and could die			1

' he later found out that parents at the meeting were ' mad ' that he asked the question as they do not immunize their children			2
now he and his wife , @entity18 , have emailed the district 's superintendent , requesting that the district ' require immunization as a condition of attendance , with the only exception being those who can not medically be vaccinated			0
' he replied them and said the district is monitoring the situation ' closely ' and will take whatever actions necessary to ensure the safety of students			0
@entity63 in @entity64 ( pictured ) has a seven per cent personal belief vaccination exemption rate unvaccinated children in @entity10 are required to stay home for the entire incubation period during any contagious - disease outbreak in their school - which is 21 days for measles - but there is no precedent for excluding unvaccinated students when there are no confirmed cases of a disease			1
@entity130 officer @entity129 told @entity131 : ' i see the father ’s request as a prompt to have important conversations as a community regarding our ethical obligations to one another			0
