if you want to play until you ’re 35 then you ’re not going about it in the best way by smoking and drinking			1
if you want to have a top career you need to give yourself every opportunity to succeed , you want to take every advantage – even being one per cent better than your opposition			1
one way of doing that is to live the life of a professional athlete and making your body as good as you can for as long as you can			0
puffing away : @entity18 was pictured smoking while on holiday in the @entity20 rising star : @entity18 's progress has been disrupted due to injuries in the short term , smoking and drinking probably would n’t have a major effect on your body			1
it would be about the quantity and regularity of it			0
if you smoke over a period of time then that ’s not going to do you any good from a fitness point of view and it obviously increases the risk of lung disease			0
it has a drip - drip effect			1
if you start young it ’s going to have an effect by the time you ’re 28 or 29			0
a sportsperson is no different to the man on the street , the effects are still the same			0
laying low : @entity18 smokes a thin cigar while relaxing in the swimming pool with friends bright future : but @entity18 risks cutting his career short if he continues smoking , says leather it will damage the lungs and decrease the ability to breathe effectively			1
with drinking it stays in your system even 48 hours afterwards , which will lead you to be more dehydrated and increase the likelihood of picking up soft tissue injuries if you train or play within that time			0
if someone , particularly a sportsperson , is smoking or drinking on a regular basis then , it ’s not rocket science , it ’s not going to do them any good .			2
