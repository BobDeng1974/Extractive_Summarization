by @entity0 for the @entity1 follow @ @ @entity2 @entity4 customers were in revolt last night after the retail chain dumped free cake and tea for loyalty scheme members			1
up to a million customers are to be stripped of the highly popular perk - introduced as a reward for allowing the high street giant to track their shopping habits - from next month			2
the my @entity4 loyalty scheme launched in october last year with free monthly vouchers for a pot of tea or coffee and a cake worth £ 5 in the store ’s restaurants for those who signed up			1
instead customers will receive tea and coffee vouchers based on how much they spend in @entity4 - and how frequently they visit the store as well as their ‘ preferences and purchases ’			1
the news comes after @entity45 , part of the @entity43 , was forced to issue a profit warning earlier this month , partly because of the popularity of its own loyalty scheme			0
shoppers with a @entity52 card – which was introduced in 2011 – receive a free tea or coffee daily , including cappuccinos , lattes and mochas , even if they do not buy anything else			2
they also receive a free copy of most daily quality newspapers if they spend more than £ 5			1
the gimmick has proved hugely popular and the supermarket is estimated to hand out one million free cups of coffee and nearly one million newspapers every week			0
the change at @entity4 means some of the scheme ’s one million members will now receive vouchers only occasionally or not at all			0
the loyalty card will still have other perks such as discounts and invites to events and entry to a prize draw			2
a spokesman for @entity4 said it was restricting the offer because its restaurants become ‘ extremely busy in the run - up to the peak @entity81 season ’			1
he said : ‘ we want to make sure our customers experience the high standards of service they expect from us during this period			0
reason ? a spokesman for the loyalty card said the restaurant gets too busy in the run - up to @entity81 ‘ all my @entity4 member rewards are continually reviewed and the rewards our members receive in future do depend on a variety of factors including shopping frequency , spend , preferences and purchases			1
’ loyal customers who had agreed to let the firm track their habits solely because of the monthly treat were angered at the decision			0
@entity107 , managing editor at consumer champion website @entity109 , said : ‘ there will be many disappointed loyal @entity4 customers – especially existing loyalty card holders			1
our site users have told us they feel let down that the offer ’s been changed			0
‘ people are really feeling the pinch and in the run up to @entity81 they more likely to have popped into the store for a free cuppa and slice of cake			1
’ a @entity4 spokesman refused to be drawn on whether its move to cut back on free drinks was down to cost			2
but free coffees and cakes in big chains have begun to attract wider criticism			0
campaigners have argued such schemes force smaller shops out of business , while some traditional shoppers worry that free drinks attract the ‘ wrong type ’ of customer .			0

loyalty card holders *previously* received free coffee and cake worth £ 5
the perk will now depend on how frequently they visit @entity4 stores
*bosses* claim it is to restrict *congestion* in the run - up to @entity81
