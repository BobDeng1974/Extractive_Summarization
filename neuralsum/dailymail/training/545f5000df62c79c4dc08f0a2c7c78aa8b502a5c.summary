@entity0 has found it increasingly hard to defeat @entity2 of late , and now the @entity5 number one 's wannabe compatriot is going to give it a try			1
@entity8 is the 25 - year - old @entity9 settled in @entity10 with a pop star girlfriend who is a protégé of the renowned music producer and tennis nut @entity12			1
the fast - rising world no 116 hopes to receive his passport and represent @entity17 this year , but for now must concentrate on his first round against the world no 1 and outright favourite for the @entity21			1
@entity8 , who hopes to represet @entity17 , will face world no 1 @entity2 on tuesday @entity9 tennis star @entity8 lives with his pop star fiancee in @entity24 , @entity25 the season 's first @entity26 was due to begin on monday morning , with @entity0 beginning his campaign against @entity31 qualifier @entity29			1
@entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34 play on day two , and then there is @entity8			1
since 2008 he has lived in an area more associated with producing outstanding golfers , such as sir @entity38 and @entity39 , and he now sees himself as part of the @entity24 scene			2
he has even represented the county at tennis , under the non-playing captaincy of @entity45 – best - known for his @entity47 musical adaptation – who works with @entity8 's girlfriend @entity49 , another who seeks @entity5 citizenship			1
at present the player is not known much beyond the tennis cognoscenti , although he is reckoned to have top 50 potential and his ranking is falsely low due to injury problems sustained last year			2
his profile would skyrocket with an upset of @entity2 , who might be more vulnerable than usual as he has been battling a virus and has had his preparations for this event disrupted			2
@entity61 – an athletic baseliner who has already been in the world 's top 75 - has had an immigration lawyer pressing for a passport for two years , but is trying to ignore any distractions as he prepares to face the formidable @entity67			1
@entity8 faces an extremely difficult @entity21 tie against @entity2 @entity2 's preparations have been disrupted as he has been battling against a virus ' i have n't been checking up on it too much here because i need to focus , ' he said on sunday			1
' i really want to play for @entity17 , that 's my life goal actually			2
i do n't know everything about it but it looks good so far and i 'm looking forward to the next few years			0
' i 'm paying taxes in @entity25 so that 's a plus , i guess			0
i live with my fiancee			0
i have a friend as well , @entity12 , who is trying to help @entity49 , which is her artist 's name in her music career			0
' so we have both been based there for our careers and i think that 's a big thing			0
we are both enjoying it there			0
i 'm planning to live there after my career as well			0
it 's just a nice place to live			0
' he confirmed that he would try to appeal against a new rule that came into effect this month preventing players who have already represented another country switching their allegiance in the @entity100			0
his problem is that he has been on the @entity9 team three times , the last occasion being three years ago			2
the potential objections from someone like long standing @entity100 stalwart @entity32 would be understandable on that basis			0
@entity32 may object against @entity8 switching from @entity9 to represent @entity17 at the @entity100			1

@entity8 is hoping to represent @entity17 later this year
the 25 - year - old @entity9 is keen on obtaining a @entity5 passport
