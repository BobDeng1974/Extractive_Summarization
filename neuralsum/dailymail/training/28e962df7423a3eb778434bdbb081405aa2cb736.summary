by @entity0 , science reporter relaxed : the research suggests women are better at coping with stressful environments multi-tasking mothers have known it for years – women are better at coping with stress than men			0
now scientists believe they can tell them why			0
it ’s all down to the protective effect of oestrogen , which appears to ‘ block ’ the negative effects of stress on the brain			2
in a @entity20 study , scientists put male and female rats through tasks that mimicked challenging experiences humans often face , such as those causing frustration and feelings of being under pressure			1
the female rats showed no impairment in their ability to recognise objects they had previously been shown , said study leader dr @entity32 , while the male rats struggled with their short - term memory			1
an inability to remember a familiar object indicates a disturbance in the part of the brain that controls working memory , attention , decision - making and other high - level ‘ executive ’ processes			0
‘ previous studies have found that females are more resilient to chronic stress and now our research has found the reason why , ’ said dr @entity32 , a professor in the department of physiology and biophysics at the @entity55			0
‘ we have examined the molecular mechanism underlying gender - specific effects of stress			0
’ earlier research by the professor found that repeated stress resulted in this area of the brain being damaged in young male rats			0
but the latest study found that it remained intact in females , even after they were subjected to stress			0
stressed out : a study of rats found males struggled with their short - term memory in stressful situations and by exposing the male rodents to greater levels of oestrogen , the team found they were protected from the effects of pressure			1
‘ when oestrogen signalling in the brains of females was blocked , stress exhibited detrimental effects on them , ’ said dr @entity32			1
‘ when oestrogen signalling was activated in males , the detrimental effects of stress were blocked			1
‘ we still found the protective effect of oestrogen in female rats whose ovaries were removed			1
it suggests that it might be oestrogen produced in the brain that protects against the detrimental effects of stress			1
’ the team found that levels of an enzyme linked to the production of oestrogen , known as aromatase , is responsible for female stress resilience			0
higher concentrations were found in the brains of female rats , they reported in the journal @entity102			2
‘ if we could find compounds similar to oestrogen that could be administered without causing hormonal side effects , they could prove to be a very effective treatment for stress - related problems in males , ’ dr @entity32 said .			2

@entity20 researchers test brains of male and female rats in stressful situations
females showed no impairment - males struggled with short - term memory
study finds oestrogen can help block the detrimental effects of stress
