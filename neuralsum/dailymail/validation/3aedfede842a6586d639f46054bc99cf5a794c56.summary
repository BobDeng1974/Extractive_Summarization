it 's the ultimate compliment for any player to have their talent recognised by their fellow professionals			0
so , to settle the argument of which is the greatest @entity9 since it started in 1992 - 93 , @entity6 has studied every @entity11 team of the year to find out which players are most highly - regarded by their peers			1
the results are fascinating – and surprising in some cases too			0
legendary @entity17 goalkeeper @entity16 was selected in only one @entity19 all - star team ( 1993 ) , as was @entity20 ( 1998 ) and therefore are well short of being considered for the greatest xi. @entity16 famously saves a penalty from @entity20 in 1999 ... but neither make the all - time xi @entity24 and @entity25 were n't voted for often enough either while @entity26 – regarded as one of the best players in @entity30 's history – was never picked in a @entity11 side			1
@entity32 and @entity33 were picked on fewer occasions than central midfield rivals @entity35 and @entity37			2
likewise , stars like @entity39 and @entity40 performed too briefly on the @entity9 stage to be chosen as often as other players			1
based on the number of times they were voted for by their fellow professionals in the @entity50 team of the season , here is the best xi over the last 23 years			1
and for @entity35 , heavily criticised after his red card against @entity17 on sunday , there is some good news – nobody has been picked more often			2
the @entity57 @entity58 ( @entity59 2007 , 2009 , 2011 ) played in @entity9 for : @entity60 , @entity17 sir @entity61 compared the @entity63 's influence with @entity16 's after he helped @entity17 return to the top following a period of dominance by @entity67 's @entity30			1
@entity58 was 34 when he joined @entity17 from @entity60 but it proved to be a master signing , and one that @entity61 admitted he wished he 'd made earlier			0
@entity58 won three league titles in a row and was the hero of @entity17 's penalty shootout win against @entity30 in the 2008 @entity74 final , making the match - winning save from @entity76			2
@entity58 celebrates with his @entity17 team - mates after beating @entity30 in may 2011 @entity78 ( 1996 , 1997 , 1998 , 1999 , 2005 , 2007 ) played for : @entity17 the heart of @entity17 's team that dominated @entity82 football for two decades and part of the @entity86 - winning side			1
@entity78 was @entity17 's effective leader and club captain off the field well before he eventually wore the armband on it			2
the right - back for @entity17 and @entity91 was the most voiceferous member of the famed class of 92 and since retirement has become a hugely influential figure both as a television pundit and @entity91 coach @entity78 was a stalwart of the @entity17 side and was named six times in the @entity100 @entity101 ( 2002 , 2005 , 2007 , 2008 , 2009 , 2013 ) played for : @entity102 , @entity103 , @entity17 , @entity104 a skilful centre half in the continental mould , @entity101 started at @entity102 but was first voted into the @entity9 team in 2002 after an excellent season at @entity103			1
after impressing at that summer 's @entity109 , @entity17 paid a £ 29million transfer fee for @entity101 , a @entity112 record that stood for four years			0
he became an integral part of @entity17 's success in the 2000s culminating in their @entity9 - @entity74 double in 2008			1
now plays for @entity104 but is expected to retire at the end of the season @entity118 ( 2007 , 2008 , 2009 , 2011 ) played for : @entity17 @entity17 's hard - man captain who formed a formidable central defensive partnership with @entity101			2
the @entity122 international endured a poor first six months at @entity123 after arriving from @entity125 football but went on to become a huge fans ' favourite			0
one of the bravest players seen at @entity123 , @entity118 put his head and body in where others feared to , leading to a number of injuries			0
when sir @entity61 left , @entity118 signed for @entity135 , and the incoming manager @entity136 missed his presence			0
@entity118 ( left ) and @entity101 formed a formidable partnership at the heart of @entity17 's defence @entity141 ( 2003 , 2004 , 2005 , 2011 ) played for : @entity142 , @entity30 considered by many the greatest @entity82 left back of all time with more than 100 caps , @entity141 won the @entity9 title with @entity142 and @entity30 with fans in north @entity147 not forgiving him for moving to @entity148			1
@entity141 was quick , mobile and had the ability to defend and attack			0
the controversial decision by @entity152 to leave him out of @entity91 's @entity109 squad backfired and @entity141 decided to move abroad where he now plays in @entity154 for @entity155			0
one of the few defenders who could get the better of @entity157 in his prime			0
@entity141 ( left ) gets the better of @entity157 during the 2004 - 05 season @entity157 ( 2006 , 2007 , 2008 , 2009 ) played for : @entity17 hard to believe he was only in the @entity9 for six years such was the impact he made			1
he was voted into the @entity11 team for four seasons in a row before he signed for @entity165 for a then world - record fee of £ 80million			1
there were eyebrows raised when sir @entity61 sold @entity169 and unveiled an unknown @entity171 teenager			0
@entity157 treated @entity123 to a series of stepovers on his debut and by 2008 was voted @entity175 , the only time that honour has gone to someone in the @entity9 after @entity178 in 2001			1
he has subsequently gone on to scale even greater heights at @entity165			0
@entity157 was named @entity175 during his outstanding @entity17 career @entity35 ( 2001 , 2004 , 2005 , 2006 , 2008 , 2009 , 2014 ) played for : @entity181 indisputably the best player of the @entity9 era not to have won the championship , @entity35 is nonetheless regarded as the greatest player in @entity181 's history alongside @entity187 and was man of the match when he led their comeback in @entity192 to win a fifth @entity74 in 2005			1
@entity35 in his prime was the ultimate box - to - box midfielder , stopping goals , creating goals and scoring goals , often spectacular ones			1
will leave @entity181 this summer to join @entity199 in the @entity200			0
no player has been named in the @entity100 more times than @entity181 captain @entity35 ( centre ) @entity37 ( 1999 , 2000 , 2001 , 2002 , 2003 , 2004 ) played for : @entity142 , @entity204 was voted into the @entity11 team for six consecutive years between 1999 and 2004 , an unprecedented spell of dominance in the @entity9 era			1
@entity37 was @entity210 's first signing – actually arriving at @entity211 shortly before the manager who was tied up with contractual issues in @entity214 – and was the blueprint for an @entity142 team who set new standards for the whole country			2
a tall , quick and powerful midfielder , @entity37 helped @entity142 win the @entity221 and then succeeded @entity222 as captain , leading the 2004 @entity225 side that went through an entire season unbeaten			0
@entity227 ( right ) gets in the team ahead of his great rival at @entity17 , @entity32 ( left ) @entity230 ( 1993 , 1998 , 2001 , 2002 , 2007 , 2009 ) played for : @entity17 statistically the greatest player in the @entity9 , with a record number of titles ( 13 ) and appearances ( 632 ) , @entity230 was named six times in the @entity11 team spanning a period of 16 years			1
he was a flying 19 - year - old winger who had led @entity17 to their first championship for 26 years when he was named in the 1993 all - star side , and a clever 35 - year - old central midfield playmaker when he was chosen in 2009			2
now assistant manager to @entity243 at @entity17 having been interim manager at the end of last season			0
@entity230 back in 1993 , when he was entered in his first @entity100 , 16 years before his last @entity247 ( 1993 , 1994 , 1995 , 1996 , 1997 , 2003 ) played for : @entity248 , @entity249 the @entity9 's record goalscorer with 260 – more than 70 goals ahead of anyone else , @entity247 won the championship with @entity248 and became the only @entity9 player to also be the world 's most expensive player when he signed for hometown club @entity249 for £ 15million having just finished as leading goalscorer at @entity259 for @entity91			1
@entity247 could score all types of goals , rocket shots , tap - ins and headers , and following a brief spell as @entity249 's interim manager , is a respected tv pundit			2
@entity247 ( left ) and strike partner @entity268 celebrate after leading @entity248 to the title in 1995 @entity270 ( 2001 , 2002 , 2003 , 2004 , 2005 , 2006 ) played for : @entity142 added @entity271 to the @entity82 game after @entity210 signed him from @entity274 and turned an inconsistent winger into the most lethal centre forward in @entity277			0
like @entity37 , @entity270 was picked for six consecutive @entity11 teams and won the @entity279 for being the leading scorer in the division on four occasions			2
rivals @entity157 as being the best @entity9 import ever seen and after spells with @entity286 and @entity287 is back in this country , offering his views on the game with @entity290			0
@entity270 was named in the @entity291 an incredible six times in a row between 2001 and 2006			0
. and an unlikely all - star xi. these players all made the @entity9 team of the season on one occasion : @entity299 ; @entity300 , @entity301 , @entity302 , @entity303 ; @entity304 , @entity305 , @entity306 , @entity307 ; @entity308 , @entity268			1
