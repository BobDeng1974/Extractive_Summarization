by @entity0 for @entity1 an orphaned cheetah cub has discovered that a dog is more than a man 's best friend at @entity6			1
when @entity9 the cheetah was abandoned by his mother , he was taken in by the zoo who found him a new friend to keep him company - @entity15 the @entity17 puppy			2
the two animals , who are both nearly four months old , scamper around their enclosure like the best of friends in this footage which was released by the zoo			1
ridgebacks are no stranger to big cats and are also known as @entity28 because they were originally bred as farm and hunting dogs in @entity31 - now @entity32			0
once they picked up the scent of a lion , they would track it down and try and confine it so a hunter with a gun could get a clean shot			0
but luckily for @entity9 the cheetah , @entity15 has been introduced to help him navigate his new home in the zoo			0
@entity44 : @entity9 the cheetah and @entity15 the @entity17 go for a walk together in @entity6 when cheetahs are born they are blind and completely rely on their mothers to protect them from predators			1
if the mother can not produce enough milk , she will often abandon her cubs in the wild leaving them to the mercy of the outside world			0
so far @entity15 the @entity17 has been showing the young cub some fun and games inside their enclosure and it looks like there is never a dull moment at @entity6 .			2
