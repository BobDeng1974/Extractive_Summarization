by @entity0 competitive parents are stripping the enjoyment from school sport , a leading headteacher has claimed			1
@entity5 , headmaster of @entity6 , @entity7 , @entity8 , said that pushy mothers and fathers are making exhibitions of themselves and damaging children ’s confidence			1
they are losing sight of the importance of ‘ good sportsmanship ’ and setting a poor example to others , he said			1
too competitive : @entity5 claimed parents are losing sight of good sportsmanship ( file picture ) mr @entity5 said everyone has seen ‘ the hysterical parent pacing up and down the sideline , shouting instructions to the player on the field who is already doing his or her best for the team ’			1
he cited a mother at a swimming gala who paced the swimming pool , yelling encouragement to her daughter who ‘ never excelled ’ at the sport			1
the woman did this ‘ to the extent that she would collapse in a heap at the end of each race , exhausted at the attempt to get her daughter across to the other end of the pool ’			1
writing in @entity50 , the magazine for the @entity49 , mr @entity5 said he had no doubt that the girl would ‘ never swim another stroke again ’ as soon as she hit puberty			1
another ‘ over-excited ’ father embarrassed himself at a rugby match by ‘ hysterically ’ shouting instructions and then throwing the ball to the player himself when a boy did n’t respond			2
mr @entity5 , whose school has 500 boys and girls aged three to 13 , urged parents to be proud when their child does well and ‘ make sure that , win or lose , you love them and are not disappointed with their performance ’			1
shouting : he cited a mother at a swimming gala who paced the swimming pool , yelling encouragement to her daughter who ' never excelled ' at the sport ( file picture ) in a bid to tackle the problem , mr @entity5 has written a series of top tips for parents on how to act at school sporting events , stressing they are ‘ not the @entity85 ’			1
this includes making an effort to support sons and daughters more , accepting the team they are placed in and not yelling at other players , coaches and officials when they make a mistake			0
in an article entitled parents behaving badly , he said : ‘ you may not even realise that you ’re doing it but do make sure you are n’t comparing your child to their team mates			2
‘ this can start to eat away at their self - confidence			0
comments like , ‘ you need to run your lines more like @entity111 ’ or ‘ @entity112 practices all the time , that ’s why she ’s better ’ , might not be meant as harmful but it can give the impression that you are n’t proud of what they have achieved			2
’ parents should also be ‘ realistic ’ about their child ’s physical ability and stage of development			2
mr @entity5 said : ‘ always remember that children play sport for their enjoyment and not yours			1
emphasising improved performances , not just winning , positively reinforces improved skills			0
‘ it is important that parents control their emotions at games and events - do n’t yell at your child , other players , coaches and officials if they make a mistake			2
rather be a cheerleader for your child and the team			0
claims : @entity5 is the head of @entity6 in @entity7 , @entity8 ‘ respect all coaches and do not question their selections			2
‘ accept the team your child is selected to play in			0
they ca n’t all be in the first team			0
he / she might be a late developer and , as a result , could make higher team later on at senior school			0
‘ more importantly , try and be a positive role model - enjoy sports yourself			0
’ parents should avoid ‘ becoming wrapped up ’ in how well their child performs and must remember the need to develop good sportsmanship			1
he said : ‘ by all means shout encouragement , not directions , from the sidelines			0
‘ only make positive comments , never bad mouth players , coaches or game officials			0
if you have a legitimate gripe , discuss it privately with those involved			0
‘ always applaud good plays without regard to who makes them and set a good example by congratulating parents of the opposing team when they win			0
’ mr @entity5 ’s intervention comes just months after former @entity85 footballer , @entity173 , warned that families screaming abuse from the sidelines are killing their children ’s love of football			1
in an article in the @entity185 , the @entity183 presenter hit out at the ‘ utterly depressing ’ culture of pushy parents attempting to turn their children into footballing superstars			1
meanwhile , in december , the football coach of a under - 10s village boys ’ team in @entity193 was fired after insisting that boys were n’t there to have fun as he was ‘ only interested in winning ’			0
@entity197 , 42 , outlined his views in an email to parents at @entity202 ’s @entity201 in @entity193 and was sacked four days later .			0
