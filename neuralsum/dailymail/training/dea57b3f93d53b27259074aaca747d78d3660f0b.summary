by @entity0 published : 11:48 est , 16 march 2014 updated : 08:53 est , 17 march 2014 profits at the fashion chain @entity4 are set to overtake @entity5 for the first time in a milestone for the chain and the high street			1
a successful @entity10 means it is on course to announce a rise of at least 12 per cent for 2013 , which would take the figure to around £ 700million			1
this puts it on course to make more money than @entity5 , which is predicted to see underlying annual pre-tax profits fall to £ 628million			1
profits booming : the latest financial figures from @entity4 represent a remarkable rise for the 34 - year - old chain the figures represent a remarkable rise for a fashion chain that began only 34 years ago , compared to @entity5 ’s 210 - year history			1
@entity5 has failed to win back customers , with the clothes in its leading ladies ad campaign – featuring the likes of @entity31 and @entity32 – criticised for lacking glamour , while its spring collection was said to be unappealing to its core market			1
that is in direct contrast to @entity4 , which is lauded for giving customers what they want , and appears prepared to embrace high - end fashion – using top models and taking inspiration from leading designers			2
the @entity4 catalogue and online store have been central to its success amid a remarkable rise in the number of people buying fashion on the internet			1
@entity10 shoppers in @entity53 as a spate of early discounting from @entity4 helped the retailer attract business at one time , the idea of buying clothes on the web without trying them on first seemed ridiculous , but this is now the fastest growing of all internet sales			1
some 21.2 per cent of all clothes and 26.3 per cent of shoes are now bought through online stores			2
@entity5 has recently re-launched its own website – a multi-million - pound make - over including catwalk videos and mix and match outfit suggestions – in a bid to cash in on the shift in shopping habits			1
@entity4 had a particularly good @entity10 , in contrast to @entity5 and the rest of the high street			1
sales were up 11.9 per cent in the eight weeks before @entity10 compared to the year before			1
profits down : customers walk near a @entity5 shop in the @entity78 the online only fashion store @entity79 has taken a huge bite out of the sales of bricks and mortar chains the company managed to hold its shelf prices while many other big stores , including @entity5 , were running promotions to get people through the door			1
sales via its directory and online division rose by 21 per cent in the festive trading period			2
analysts say @entity4 ’s sales figures were driven by areas such as knitwear and sleepwear , as well as strong growth in homeware			2
it overtook @entity5 in terms of stock market value in 2012 and it now sits at some £ 10.2billion compared to £ 7.5billion for @entity5			1
next , which has around 500 stores , plans to expand its retail space by 4 per cent during 2014 , while also increasing its online business in the @entity108 and overseas			2
it plans to launch a site in @entity111 this year			2
the shift to the web is also likely to be reflected in strong figures this week from online fashion store @entity79 , which has taken a huge bite out of high street sales			0
the group achieved sales of £ 335.7million in the four months to december 31			0
the figure from the @entity108 alone rose 37 per cent , while sales overseas were up by 38 per cent			0
@entity79 , which stands for @entity121 , is aimed at ‘ fashion forward twenty - somethings ’ , and has steadily expanded around the world			0
it recently launched in @entity111 and is expected to hit its target of £ 1billion in total sales this financial year			2
@entity126 : a jacket from @entity4 's 2014 collection it 's no surprise that @entity4 has finally overtaken ailing @entity5			1
both stores have long been trying to throw off their reputation of selling slightly dowdy workwear and frumpy casual clothes			0
@entity5 hired fashion guru @entity134 to revamp its collections , but went off - mark with its leading ladies ad campaign , which was derided for looking dowdy despite its celebrity cast			1
worse , the spring collection , which was filled with crop tops and acid floral prints , was panned for being unlikely to appeal to its core market of middle - aged women			0
@entity4 has been far more savvy , and listened to customers			0
the key message seems to have been that they were prepared to pay more for quality classics inspired by the catwalk			0
on the @entity4 website you ’ll find neat office dresses that are dead ringers for @entity152 designs and cost £ 35			0
the designs are carefully cut and conscious of what older women want : there ’s plenty of sleeves , nipped - in waists , control slips and flattering cuts in classic colours			0
better yet , alongside its own collections , @entity4 has started selling brands such as @entity165 , @entity166 and @entity167			0
not only does this make its own clothes seem more desirable , but gives customers an added incentive to buy from them			0
next has also stuck with its directory ( every woman was on the mailing list in the @entity177 ) , but added a day delivery service that gives you the option to shop until 10pm and still receive your outfit the following day			0
lastly , in contrast to @entity5 , @entity4 has returned to using top models			2
the directory of the @entity177 featured @entity186 and @entity187 on its cover , and the current one has new face @entity191 doing the same job – making their high street clothes look like haute couture			0
no wonder women are flocking back .			0

successful @entity10 means chain 's profits rise at least 12 per cent
the figures represent a remarkable rise for the 34 - year - old chain
meanwhile , @entity5 pre-tax profits are predicted to fall to £ 628million
