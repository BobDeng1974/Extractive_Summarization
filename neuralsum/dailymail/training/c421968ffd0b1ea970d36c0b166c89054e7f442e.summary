@entity0 is always very special to me because of @entity2 , and i love @entity3 , of course			2
but now i have added @entity5 to my list of special places			1
it 's very surprising to me ! i was invited to visit because i have artworks in the @entity10 2014			2
i thought i was coming to a sleepy little town , but i found this amazing energy , so much activity - a kind of spiritual rising			1
it 's not just a beautiful place ; it also has an incredible history linked to the @entity19 a new vision : @entity21 only gazes across the waterfront in @entity5 on her first visit to the @entity25 port - town i went to pay my respects at the new @entity27 , and i think it 's so powerful			1
it was dedicated by @entity30 in august to the fallen soldiers and nurses who walked down @entity33 to the harbour to go to war			2
there are crocheted red poppies on the railings lining the road , and it 's very moving			2
all the artworks from the @entity42 are placed around the town , and they are part of daily life , instead of being a show in a museum			1
so you see them when you 're shopping or walking on your way to work , it 's very casual			0
@entity5 is a town that wants the world to know that it likes art , that it is sensitive to art , and i wanted to promote that idea			1
i am invited to art events around the world , but i wanted to go to @entity5 because i believe in localisation , and i wanted to wave the flags for them			1
@entity63 and beautiful : @entity64 shows its arty side in the studios , galleries and shops of its @entity70 i made @entity71 , one of my installations , to acknowledge the debt owed to those who died in the wars of the last century			0
the words are on a billboard by the railway station , and on a flag at the grand hotel			0
there is also a light spelling out ' @entity71 ' in @entity84			0
i wanted to acknowledge the soldiers who died in the @entity86			1
i saw old photos of them in a wonderful exhibition , @entity5 , organised by the local @entity90			1
i had gone to the @entity91 to see my other installation , skyladder 2014 , and when i went up the stairs i discovered the exhibition			1
i learned that , during the @entity86 , the people of @entity5 took in 115,000 @entity97 refugees who arrived by boat and were welcomed and treated very well			1
it was much more than double the population - how did they manage ? that was quite something in those days			0
in fact i was welcomed here myself once before , in 1966			0
it was the year i met @entity2 , and i came to the @entity107 for what they now call performance art. it was very avant - garde and i did n't think anybody would understand it , but people here showed me smiles , and that was a sign for me			0
there is something special about a town by the water			2
the sea air is very good for your health			0
@entity2 's @entity124 used to live at the seaside			0
when @entity2 became halfway successful , he bought a beautiful house for her at @entity127 in @entity128 , overlooking the ocean			0
as a child in @entity131 , i had a very special situation , because my mother had a summer house at the seaside in @entity136			0
now i live in @entity137 , but @entity138 is an island , surrounded by water			0
in @entity5 , there is a wonderful fish restaurant , @entity142 , where i had a fabulous squid lunch			1
the setting by the harbour is amazing			2
pretty persuasion : @entity21 praises @entity5 for its ' amazing energy ' , and says it could ' cleanse your spirit ' over lunch we were discussing the fact that the guy who designed the @entity155 peace sign , @entity156 , is buried near here			1
he must have an incredibly strong vibe , and with all the vibrations of the other beautiful people i thought : ' no wonder ! ' i went there to give energy and it was the other way round ! i got a lot back			2
it was a spiritual exchange , extremely positive , and it made me happy			0
visit @entity5 â€¦ it could cleanse your spirit			1
@entity21 was talking to @entity167			0
the @entity42 2014 ( www.folkestonetriennial.org.uk ) runs until november 2 .			1

widow of @entity170 visited the town for the @entity42 event
