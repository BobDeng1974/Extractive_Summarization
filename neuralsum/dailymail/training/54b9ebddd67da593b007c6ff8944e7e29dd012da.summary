@entity1 , 45 , who is also an electrician , gives seminars on how he continues to catch striped bass weighing 50lbs or more , but wo n't reveal all his secrets			1
@entity1 set the world record two years ago by catching a striped bass that weighed 81.8lbs off the @entity3 coast			1
last year he set the striped bass length record of about 44 inches			1
just last month he caught a 73 - pound bass ' i 'm just going to go ahead and say it : @entity1 is the greatest living striper fisherman , ' declared @entity22 in an account last month in @entity24			1
@entity25 , owner of on the @entity27 magazine , said he does n't know anyone who 's caught so many large striped bass			1
@entity1 reached the pinnacle by methodically studying his prey and developing devices to lure the fish to him and , perhaps , change how people fish			1
' i 've gotten it down to a science , ' @entity1 said			2
' that 's what all these great catches are attributed to , knowledge of the fish			0
you got ta think like them			0
' the 45 - year - old electrician from @entity2 began fishing at age two			0
at eight , he used the feathers from his grandmother 's dead parrot to make his first fly , catching a rare rainbow trout and realizing the thrill of catching a fish with something he made			0
he studied fish , learning that striped bass feed on lobster and are drawn to them by the sound they make along the ocean floor			1
@entity1 began trying to replicate that sound with a rattle he put in sinkers , at one point using discarded crack cocaine vials he cleaned up at work and filled with bearings and bbs			2
his methods grew more sophisticated as he listened to crayfish in his 200 - gallon aquarium with a stethoscope			0
he also used a sound meter to determine the decibel and frequency and then tweaked the sound of the rattle to mimic it as much as possible			0
last year @entity1 ( pictured center ) set the striped bass length record of about 44 inches @entity1 ( pictured left ) has been called the @entity8 of the fishing world , giving seminars on how to catch the big bass ' it 's the reason why i caught more big striped bass than anyone in the world , ' @entity1 said			1
' it was my secret weapon for years			0
' @entity1 said he 's received patents for his rattling sinkers designed to lure the striped bass to fishermen and formed a company called @entity95 to sell the products			1
' we 're changing the whole fishing industry			0
we already have , ' @entity1 said			2
@entity1 stocked a stream on his property with trout and noticed how the biggest ones take the best spot			2
he figures striped bass do the same , such as by staying near a boulder that breaks the current so they can conserve energy as they wait for lobster to come out when tides are slow			1
he likes to head out in the evening and will fish through the night at times			0
he insists on quiet , often barefoot on the boat to prevent noise and alert to the slightest disturbance to his line			0
@entity1 really began to attract attention when he caught three bass in 2010 that weighed more than 60 pounds and won angler of the year			1
in 2011 , @entity1 headed out in calm waters off the @entity3 coast when he snagged a powerful fish that began to pull his boat			1
' it was an incredible fight , ' @entity1 said			2
the 81.8 - pound catch , certified by the @entity125 , broke a 29 - year - old record of more than 78 pounds			0
@entity1 stands with a friend , holding two massive bass weighing over 50lbs in @entity3 @entity1 said he 's caught more than 25 striped bass that weighed at least 50 pounds , eight or nine over 60 pounds and three more than 70 pounds			1
@entity1 has become so famous in the fishing world that others will follow him			1
@entity1 said he did n't catch all the big fish in the same spot			2
' no one knows where those spots are , ' he said			0

' @entity1 said he has fished with actor @entity141 , retired ballplayer @entity142 , top chef @entity143 , @entity145 football player @entity144 and even an astronaut			2
@entity1 is proud of his records but does n't dwell on them			2
' i kind of almost crave that bite that i know is coming , ' @entity1 said			0
' i do n't care about any of the fish i 've already caught			0
the best fish is the next fish for me			0
