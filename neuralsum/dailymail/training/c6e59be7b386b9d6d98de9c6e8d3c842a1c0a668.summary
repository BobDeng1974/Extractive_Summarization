by @entity0 published : 04:52 est , 9 may 2013 updated : 05:08 est , 10 may 2013 @entity1 last night allowed ministers to vote against the @entity3 as he struggled to contain a growing @entity5 mutiny on the issue of @entity7			1
in an extraordinary development , @entity9 sources said @entity5 mps would be given a free vote next week on a backbench amendment to the speech that expresses ‘ regret ’ about the lack of legislation for a referendum on @entity7			2
the move came as senior @entity20 ignored the prime minister ’s pleas to pipe down on the issue in the wake of last week ’s elections , when @entity27 gave the @entity20 a bloody nose			1
he said @entity5 grandees such as former chancellor @entity42 and one - time leadership contender @entity43 were ‘ wrong ’ to say @entity40 should leave the @entity44 now			1
former @entity5 chancellor @entity45 also suggested @entity40 would be better off out , saying the economic advantages of @entity44 membership were ‘ vastly over-stated ’			1
today @entity33 mayor @entity48 said it would not be ' cataclysmic ' if @entity40 left the @entity44			1
' we should be prepared to pull out			0
you ca n’t go into a negotiation like that without being willing to walk away , ' he told @entity57 's today programme			0
' and i do n’t think , by the way , that it would be anything like as cataclysmic as is sometimes pretended			0
i do n’t think it would lose millions of jobs , far from it			0
i think the economic benefits and dis - benefits are now much more balanced			0
' but he backed mr @entity1 's renegotiation strategy : ' what we need to do is to say to our friends and partners : " listen chums this thing is n’t working for either of us			2
your eurozone is causing all sorts of misery , plus the on - costs , the none wage costs , the way that the @entity44 has been running , has legislated , has regulated over the last 20 , 30 years are making our continent , making the whole area completely uncompetitive "			2
' and a third former chancellor , @entity86 ’s @entity85 said he now believed the ‘ case for leaving is stronger than staying in ’			0
@entity5 rebels last night revealed they had tabled an amendment to the @entity3 criticising the lack of legislation to hold an in / out referendum			1
@entity95 changed her view about @entity40 's @entity44 membership after the @entity98 in 1992 , her biographer claimed mr @entity1 has told his mps he is unable to bring forward government legislation to enact his pledge to hold a referendum in 2017 because of opposition from the @entity104			1
but @entity105 last night said he was ‘ relaxed ’ about the amendment and suggested @entity5 mps and ministers would be free to vote for it			0
if commons speaker @entity111 agrees to the vote it will be held next tuesday			0
mr @entity1 will be on an official visit to the @entity114 , but other cabinet ministers are expected to vote in what would be a criticism of their own @entity3 and a clear sign of dissatisfaction with the @entity120			1
the amendment is purely symbolic but its supporters claim it will help build an unstoppable momentum for a referendum to be held			0
backers include eurosceptics @entity126 , @entity128 and @entity129 , and maverick @entity130			0
the amendment does not demand legislation on a referendum but ‘ respectfully regrets ’ that no bill was included in wednesday ’s @entity3 , which set out the government ’s legislative agenda for the coming year			1
mr @entity126 said its purpose was to send a clear message that the demand for a bill was ‘ not going away ’			0
it underlines the pressure mr @entity1 is facing to sanction backbench legislation on a referendum			0
the prime minister ’s official spokesman said he had ‘ always said he is very happy to look at all ways of strengthening his commitment to an in / out referendum in the next @entity150 ’			1
@entity1 is under pressure to bring forward legislation on his promise to stage an @entity44 referendum former defence secretary @entity43 said he would vote to quit @entity38 while @entity33 mayor @entity48 , pictured yesterday , argued @entity40 could survive outside the @entity44 yesterday mr @entity1 told a conference he was right to try to renegotiate @entity40 ’s membership of the @entity44 before putting the new deal to a referendum after the next election			1
he said : ‘ i think it is possible to change and reform this organisation and change and reform @entity40 ’s relationship with it			0
’ but speaking at the same conference later in the day , mr @entity48 , the @entity33 mayor , suggested @entity40 would benefit from leaving the @entity44			1
he said that if mr @entity1 ’s bid to renegotiate membership of the @entity44 failed ‘ then obviously we should be ready to walk away ’			2
he said : ‘ i think it would be a shot in the arm because people would suddenly feel , yes , we are running our own destiny again			0
’ mr @entity48 said he was ‘ broadly in favour of the single market ’ but said its benefits had been overstated			2
@entity104 sources said it would be ‘ extraordinary ’ for @entity5 ministers to vote against the @entity3			1
a source said : ‘ the conservatives seem to want to talk about @entity7 when we should be talking about the positive things in the @entity3 like the reforms on pensions and social care			2

@entity3 vote to be *hijacked* by @entity20 demanding referendum
prime minister *insists* it is ' possible ' to push through changes to the @entity44
@entity48 says impact of exit would not be ' cataclysmic '
@entity95 backed *withdrawal* from the @entity44 , her biographer claims
@entity43 and @entity45 back @entity42 's call to exit
