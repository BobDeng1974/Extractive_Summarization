describing the garment on its website , the makers say : ' protection from the sun is a priority , especially if you spend a lot of time at the pool or beach			1
and while cover - ups can go just about anywhere , the one place they ca n’t is in the water			1

designed to wear over your swimsuit top , it ’s soft as your favorite tee and incredibly lightweight - even while wearing it in the water ! ' it ’s not just for swimming though			1
it also works as a colorful cover - up when the air turns cooler or you ’re just looking to shade your skin			1
' while she 's often criticised for regularly recommending outrageously priced luxury items on her lifestyle website , @entity2 wants her critics to know that she 's just a regular girl			1
the 42 - year - old @entity77 - winning actress recently insisted she 's like all other women because , despite her fame , she still seeks the same things as others			1
she recently told @entity82 : ' i 'm incredibly close to the common woman in that i 'm a woman and i 'm a mother and we all are in a physical body with beating hearts with compassion and love we are all seekers ... @entity2 recently insisted she 's ' close to the common woman ' in an interview ' we all want fulfilment , we all want to live our best lives			1
we want to be healthy and happy and squeeze the most we can out of life			2
i think that 's all women			2
' the @entity96 star - who has children @entity98 , ten , and @entity99 , eight , with estranged husband @entity101 - continued to say she is keen to be seen as a normal woman through her lifestyle website @entity9 , and not a ' guru ' who professes to know all of the answers to people 's problems			2
she explained : ' what we try to do at @entity9 is curate and to edit			2
we know that a woman 's time is her most precious resource and we want to multitask , get a lot done , and what we want to do is provide the best solutions			2
the @entity96 star says she is keen to be seen as a normal woman through her lifestyle website @entity9 her lifestyle website , @entity9 , features everything from fashion to health and beauty advice ' i see myself as an actor and a mother and as an entrepreneur			2
i do n't see myself as a guru at all			2
i 'm not a guru because i 'm the one asking the questions			0
i 'm not purporting to know anything			0
' during a recent appearance on @entity132 's @entity131 ahead of @entity133 , the star said of the perception of her site : ' i think there is sometimes a miscommunication			0
' ' we are n't a super-luxury site , but we 're aspirational			0
we have things on there that cost $ 4			0
we have things on there that cost $ 500			0
sometimes i think that some of the criticism @entity9 gets is because people have n’t actually gone to the site and looked around and seen what we actually are			0
' in 2011 , the star admitted that the near - deafening criticism she faced over @entity9 prompted her to consider quitting the brand altogether			0
' there were a couple of times when i thought , " i 'm just gon na stop doing it			0
people are so mean to me			0
i do n't want to do it , " ' she told @entity158 @entity157			0
' but then i was like , " who cares what some lame person out there says ? " i was in @entity164 once , and this old man came up to me and said , " i had the best time in @entity167 because of @entity9			0
" and that is so worth it to me			0
