@entity0 , 50 , says she no longer leaves the house because insecurities over her psoriasis have left her feeling ' hideous ' and like a ' leper ' a woman has described how unsightly patches of silvery ' bark ' are forming all over her body as a result of the skin condition psoriasis			1
@entity0 , 50 , is covered in thick , red welts and rough , silvery scales , which she described as ' looking like bark ' or ' plaster of @entity20 '			1
she is constantly itching and feels ' hideous ' , but despite trying a range of treatments to help manage her condition , nothing has worked			1
she now no longer leaves the house due to her insecurities , and has also developed arthritis in her joints - a problem related to her skin condition - making walking painful			1
her insecurities grew after she was thrown out a library and swimming pool due to psoriasis , which also affects celebrities such as @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity39 's @entity38			1
' i was asked to leave our local library because people complained i was getting flakes on the keyboard , ' @entity46 from @entity47 , @entity48 , said			0
' they thought i might be contagious and would n't let me back without a letter from a doctor			2
' then one day , i built enough courage to go swimming , but within seconds of stepping out the changing rooms i was told i could n't get in the water			0
' i 'm treated like a modern - day leper so now i barely leave the house			2
' according to the @entity61 consortium , 125 million people worldwide — 2 to 3 per cent of the total global population — have psoriasis			2
it is a skin condition that causes red , flaky , crusty patches of skin covered with silvery scales			1
it occurs when the process by which the body produces skin cells is accelerated			1
normally the cells are replaced by the body every three to four months , but in psoriasis the process only lasts about three to seven days			1
the resulting build - up of skin cells creates the silvery , bark - like patches that miss @entity46 suffers			1
it is believed this happens as the immune system attacks healthy skin cells by mistake			2
miss @entity46 has been thrown out of shops , swimming pools and bars as the managers worried her condition was contagious			1
she now never leaves the house			1
her arms are pictured , left and right the condition causes red , flaky , patches of skin covered with silvery scales to form on her body			1
there is no cure , and treatments to manage the symptoms have not worked			0

' even the dandruff shampoo i 'd been using had n't helped , ' she said			0
' i was only 24 and took pride in my appearance			2
but most days i looked like i 'd stepped out of a snow storm			0
' ' it was getting worse by the day			0
' taking her clothes off was a nightmare , as her skin came away as she pulled off the garment			2
' i inched my sock down my leg and peeled the top layer of my skin off with it , ' she said			0
' @entity128 , my body was slowly being swallowed up by a thick covering of scales and sores , even between my fingers and toes			1
' she was finally diagnosed at age 24 , but diagnosis brought little relief as there is no cure for the condition			1
' the doctor explained it 's a skin condition that can cause flaky red patches of skin covered with silvery scales , ' miss @entity46 said			1
' they told me there was no cure but that most people are only affected in small areas so it would be manageable with creams and medication			0
' miss @entity46 says the silvery patches look like bark or plaster of @entity20			1
she suffers constant itching , and has difficulty taking on and off her clothes because they stick to her skin , causing sores			0
her legs are pictured , right and left ' the itching drives me crazy , ' she continued			0
' my skin is so dry and brittle that my constant scratching leaves me red and bleeding			1
' even though i slather myself in moisturising cream in the morning , by evening i have to peel my clothes away from my skin , where they 've welded themselves to my weeping wounds			0
' the affected bits looked like thick bark or as if i 'd been covered in plaster of @entity20			1
' she has tried an array of treatments to reduce her symptoms , but claims nothing has worked			0
' it 's on my legs , arms and torso , ' miss @entity46 said			0
' it 's even between my fingers and toes			0
i 've tried creams , tablets and uv light treatment but nothing 's made any difference			0
' i even bathed in tar because someone said it would help			0
' she said the physical pain she endures from the psoriasis is nothing compared to the insecurities the condition has left her with			1
as well as the library and swimming pool , she has been thrown out of bars , shops and restaurants			1

' i developed psoriatic arthritis so walking became almost impossible anyway			1
' between 10 and 30 per cent of people who have psoriasis also develop psoriatic arthritis , according to studies , as both are caused by inflammation			1
