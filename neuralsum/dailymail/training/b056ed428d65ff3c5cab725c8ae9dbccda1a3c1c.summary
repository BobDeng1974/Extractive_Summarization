by @entity0 published : 18:21 est , 29 november 2012 updated : 18:25 est , 29 november 2012 @entity2 's political class escaped serious criticism from @entity4 – despite extensive evidence to his inquiry that members of it got ‘ too close ’ to media barons in the hope of securing the support of newspapers			1
@entity4 explicitly rejected @entity14 claims that mr @entity15 had done a ‘ deal ’ with @entity20 in the run - up to the last election in return for the support of @entity18 he said the evidence ‘ does not establish anything resembling a “ deal ” whereby @entity26 ’s support was traded for the expectation of policy favours ’			1
@entity30 cleared : despite extensive evidence to @entity4 's ( right ) inquiry that members of the political class got ' too close ' to media barons , they have been cleared of serious criticism including @entity15 ( left ) after @entity4 rejected claims that he had done a ' deal ' with @entity20 in the @entity40 , the prime minister seized on the finding to demand an apology from both @entity14 and @entity43 , who had claimed the @entity49 ‘ shaped their policy to match the demands of @entity48 ’			1
mr @entity15 said : ‘ those who repeatedly made these allegations – including members of this @entity54 and , i have to say , the former prime minister – should now acknowledge they were wrong			1
’ mr @entity43 was not available for comment last night			1
trouble texts : the report pored over mr @entity15 's relationship with former @entity26 boss @entity59 including embarrassing text read out during the inquiry @entity4 said that over the last 30 years senior politicians on both sides had ‘ developed too close a relationship with the @entity63 in a way which has not been in the public interest ’			1
he said party leaders had spent too much time courting the press and had gone ‘ too far in trying to control the supply of news and information to the public in return for the hope of favourable treatment ’			0
media companies ‘ should not be criticised for or restrained from ’ lobbying for their interests and he said it was ‘ entirely the responsibility of politicians ’ to keep the public interest paramount			0
but most individual politicians escaped serious censure , despite detailed evidence about the way in which some on both sides courted the @entity20 empire			0
@entity4 said that mr @entity15 ‘ went to great lengths to secure meetings face - to - face with mr @entity20 and other @entity26 executives and editors ’			1
the report also pored over his close relationship with former @entity26 boss @entity59 , whose text exchanges with the prime minister caused him excruciating embarrassment when they were read out during the inquiry			1
it emerged that mr @entity15 even signed off the messages lol – thinking this meant lots of love – when it actually meant ‘ laugh out loud ’			1
in a text to mr @entity15 on the day before his 2009 conference speech mrs @entity59 said : ‘ i am so rooting for you tomorrow , not just as a proud friend but because professionally we ’re definitely in this together			1
’ a further text referred to mr @entity15 ’s use of a horse owned by her husband @entity117			1
mr @entity15 sent her a message saying : ‘ the horse @entity117 put me on			1
fast , unpredictable and hard to control but fun			0
dc. ’ the inquiry also heard evidence that the @entity125 enjoyed regular ‘ country suppers ’ with mrs @entity59 , who is a fellow member of the so - called ‘ @entity128 set ’			0
@entity4 said this ‘ demonstrates how the discussion of professional matters in a very informal social environment was occurring			1
’ he said the pair had continued to keep in touch even after the phone hacking scandal began to take off in late 2010 but said mr @entity15 ’s recollection of a call on the subject was ‘ imperfect ’			1
' too close ' : lord @entity4 said that @entity15 's close relationship with @entity59 had caused problems with perception he said there was nothing wrong with politicians having close friendships with media executives , but warned it led to problems of ‘ public perception ’			1
the report said there were ‘ too many issues where the public ... has been entitled to worry about the way things have been done and what has been going on ’			0
mr @entity43 denied courting the @entity20 empire , despite evidence to the inquiry that his wife @entity160 had hosted a pyjama party at @entity162 attended by @entity163 , mr @entity20 ’s wife @entity164 and daughter @entity165			2
@entity4 concluded : ‘ on a personal level , mr @entity43 was also quite close to mrs @entity59 and his wife @entity160 was described as a good friend ’			1
the inquiry also heard evidence on how @entity171 had courted the @entity172 as part of a successful effort to win the backing of the @entity18 supported report : former @entity14 spin - doctor @entity177 has urged the prime minister to back the report this included an article for the newspaper headlined ‘ my love for the @entity184 ’ , which @entity177 said was ‘ likely to be the final piece of the jigsaw before mr @entity20 agreed the paper would back the @entity188 at the election ’			2
@entity4 raised concerns about @entity14 ’s ‘ unprecedented ’ use of political spin			1
he said there was an ‘ obvious question ’ about the extent to which the party ’s strategy of ‘ neutralising ’ hostile sections of the @entity63 eventually backfired and ‘ resulted in diminishing public confidence in political communications ’			0
speaking to the @entity202 , former @entity14 spin - doctor mr @entity177 said he supported the @entity4 report and urged the prime minister to back it , saying : ‘ this is not a bonkers proposal			1
’ the report examined mr @entity15 ’s recruitment of former @entity211 editor @entity210 as communications chief			2
@entity4 expressed surprise that @entity214 had recommended mr @entity210 , given that he had overseen a number of damaging stories about the party as editor			2
he added : ‘ that mr @entity210 had resigned in response to the conviction and imprisonment of one of his journalists added yet another reason to question why it was that mr @entity210 ’s name came to mr @entity214 ’s mind			0
’ @entity4 said it was ‘ clear ’ that inquiries did not go beyond asking mr @entity210 about the issue and accepting his assurances ’			2
@entity232 created a ‘ serious problem ’ in the way he handled @entity20 ’s £ 8billion bid for @entity235 but he did not show ‘ actual bias ’ , the report found			0
@entity4 was critical of the former culture secretary ’s decision to appoint his special adviser @entity240 to liaise with @entity48 over the bid , even though he was a friend of the firm ’s chief lobbyist @entity242			1
he said mr @entity232 then failed to supervise his adviser properly			0
@entity4 said this led to a ‘ serious hidden problem ’ in the handling of the bid			2
it was ‘ probable ’ that mr @entity240 had passed confidential information to @entity48 this could have resulted in legal action against the government by opponents of the bid if it had been made public while a decision was being considered			2
not ' actual bias ' : @entity232 created a ' serious problem ' in the way he handled @entity20 's £ 8billion bid for @entity235 , the report found he said the ‘ interactions between those acting on behalf of media companies and politicians concerning this multi-billion - pound proposed media transaction provide a good example of how easily the relationship can become unhealthy ’			2
but @entity4 said that in other respects mr @entity232 had handled the bid ‘ commendably ’ , putting in place ‘ robust systems ’ to ensure it was dealt with properly			2
he rejected outright @entity14 suggestions that mr @entity232 was given the job of overseeing the bid because of his known closeness to the @entity172 , saying : ‘ the evidence does not begin to support a conclusion that the choice of mr @entity232 was the product of improper media pressure , still less an attempt to guarantee a particular outcome to the process			2
’ @entity4 said there was ‘ no credible evidence of actual bias on the part of mr @entity232 ’			0
but he added : ‘ the voluminous exchanges between mr @entity242 and mr @entity240 , in the circumstances give rise to a perception of bias			0
’ @entity15 said the report had highlighted lessons which needed to be learned about the handling of quasi-judicial decisions by ministers			0
but he welcomed the conclusion that the appointment of mr @entity232 had not been intended to help @entity20 and had not resulted in bias			0
mr @entity15 said this vindicated his decision to back mr @entity232 , who was promoted to the job of health secretary in september			0
he told @entity306 that mr @entity232 had ‘ endured a stream of allegations with great dignity ’			0
he went on : ‘ we were right to stand by him			0
’ during the crisis @entity14 had called for mr @entity232 to resign			0
@entity306 , including @entity312 , abstained in a vote of confidence on mr @entity232			0
@entity48 ’s bid to take total control of @entity235 was abandoned when the phone hacking scandal broke .			0

@entity15 has demanded an apology from @entity14 and @entity43 who claimed the @entity49 were influenced by @entity48
@entity4 said politicians had ' developed too close a relationship ' with press
