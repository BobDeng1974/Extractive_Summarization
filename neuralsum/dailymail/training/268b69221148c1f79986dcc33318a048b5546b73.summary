by @entity0 published : 11:41 est , 20 november 2012 updated : 05:08 est , 21 november 2012 the family of a teenager crushed to death by a tree branch have been awarded an undisclosed pay - out			1
@entity6 , 13 , was killed instantly after sustaining fatal head injuries when she was hit by the 20ft long branch			1
she was off school at time because of a teachers ’ strike and was sat on a park bench under the 85 - year - old @entity13			2
heartbreak : @entity6 's parents said no amount of money would ever make up for the loss of their daughter the branch fell due to a natural phenomenon called @entity21 ( @entity22 ) which causes branch limbs to randomly explode			1
the condition is caused by long periods of dry weather followed by a sudden down pour of rain			0
branches which have been dried out can explode when it rains and the tree soaks up a lot of water			0
@entity6 , who left a twin brother @entity32 , died after she was hit by the branch on june 30 , 2011			1
days after the tragedy a second branch fell from the same tree - which had not been roped off and where friends and family were laying flowers			2
experts who examined the tree in @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , said it was full of decay and should have been felled by the council before the tragedy			1
an inspection carried out by the @entity48 ( @entity48 ) a month after @entity6 ’s death found that eleven trees in the park were “ high risk			1
” an inquest into @entity6 ’s death in december 2011 heard the tree was at “ significant risk ” of loosing branches			2
yesterday @entity56 agreed to pay an undisclosed out - of - court settlement to the family			1
lessons : an inquest heard that another branch had fallen from the same tree days after the tragedy as mourners were leaving flowers			0
but @entity6 ’s parents @entity66 , a civil servant , and @entity69 , an account manager , said ' no amount of money ' could make up for what happened			2
in a statement they said : ' the last 16 months have been horrendous as we ’ve struggled to come to terms with the fact @entity6 is no longer with us			2
' she was a beautiful girl with her whole life ahead of her but this has been taken from her and it is heartbreaking			0
her loss to us is immeasurable , and our grief endless			0
' at first it seemed a tragic case of fate or wrong time , wrong place , sadly after the coroner ’s inquest it became apparent that this was not the case			0
' we just hope councils across the country take note and learn from the mistakes that led to @entity6 ’s death			0
' nothing can bring her back , and no amount of money could ever make up for what happened , but we want to be sure no one else suffers such a huge loss as we have			0
' investigation : a @entity48 probe found 11 other trees in the park were of ' high risk ' to the public tributes : friends laid flowers and left emotional tributes at the tree where @entity6 was killed in june last year @entity6 , an year 8 pupil from @entity116 , was spending the day at @entity117 after her school closed due to industrial action			1
the @entity48 found @entity56 was not ensuring the health and safety of the public as it could not prove it had an effective system for managing trees in the park			1
@entity126 , from lawyers @entity127 who represented the family , said : ' this is one of the most tragic cases i have ever worked on			0
' we were determined to get answers for @entity6 ’s family to see if anything could have prevented her death and also ensure lessons are learnt by councils across the country to prevent a similar tragedy from happening again			1
' a spokesman for @entity56 yesterday refused to comment .			0
