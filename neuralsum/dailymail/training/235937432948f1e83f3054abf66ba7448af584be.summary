by @entity0 plea : chief constable @entity1 , 46 , claims police should be exempt from rules that bar parents from term time holidays as officers have to work during summer and @entity7 a police chief has called on schools to give officers ' children special holiday allowance during term time			1
chief constable @entity1 , 46 , said headteachers should ' fully consider ' requests from police because they are busy in the summer and at @entity7			1
the plea comes despite a clampdown banning parents from term time holidays except under ' exceptional circumstances '			1
if parents in @entity24 and @entity25 fail to ensure their children attend school , they may be issued with penalty notices of £ 50 to £ 100			2
@entity29 can result in a fine of up to £ 2,500 , a jail sentence of up to three months or a community sentence			1
however , in a letter to every headteacher in her area , @entity33 chief ms @entity1 said that police officers deserve to be exempt from the rules as their holiday period is ' restricted ' to term times			1
she claims due to the @entity42 in @entity43 and the @entity44 in south @entity25 , officers will be deprived of normal holiday leave			2
' i respectfully ask therefore that any applications for term time absence are fully considered , ' she added			1
the suggestion has sparked outrage , with critics claiming the police force is just one of many industries that has high - time at summer and @entity7			1
@entity55 , a representative of the @entity56 , said there was ' inflexibility in a lot of professions '			0
he added : ' we have sympathy with the police service but it would make the head teacher 's position untenable with the rest if the parent body if they started making exceptions			2
' defending ms @entity1 , @entity70 chairman of the @entity71 said his members deserve special treatment			2
' they 're not able to take their leave during the peak times and it is not their fault , ' he said			0
yesterday figures revealed more than one in three parents are still taking their children on holiday during term time as they can not afford summer rates			1
crackdown : education secretary @entity88 announced plans that levy fines and prosecution against parents who take their children out of school during term time in a bid to avoid peak holiday fares @entity1 , from @entity96 , rocketed up the ranks within the space of a few years			1
she entered the force as a graduate , starting as a @entity101 in @entity102 in 1989			0
in 1991 , she was promoted to @entity103 , to @entity104 in 1995 , then to chief inspector in 1998			2

in the years that followed , she headed the region 's @entity113 and controlled a £ 560 million budget , earning the accolade of @entity117			2
in 2010 , she became the first female chief constable of @entity119 in @entity120 , praised with bringing a ' corporate edge ' to the force			1
after moving to @entity123 in april 2013 , she was awarded the @entity124 for her work			0
at the same time , one in five of these parents are fabricating emergencies to hide what they are doing - putting their child 's absence down to an invented illness			2
the research by @entity134 also found the average family break in @entity137 rockets up by £ 1,347 once term time ends			1
this compares to the current penalty of £ 60 for an unauthorised absence which can be increased to £ 2,500 if the case ends up in the courts			1
yesterday , a couple in @entity145 were handed criminal records and a £ 800 fine after taking a 13 - day holiday in @entity148 to visit relatives as the children 's grandmother was terminally ill. the tough line on punishing parents who take children out of school has been championed by the @entity88 , @entity156 , who said they could not afford to miss lessons if they were to achieve the results expected			1
he has turned the screw on parents and schools by ending a policy that allowed schools to grant up to 10 days holiday a year to families in ‘ special circumstances ’			1
the policy has caused enormous anger among parents , while a @entity173 banker has recently lodged a legal test case to challenge the law			2
@entity176 was summonsed to court after he refused to pay a £ 120 fine for taking his children to @entity180 for six days at the start of the spring term for a memorial service for their great - grandfather			1
mr @entity176 , who works for @entity186 , will argue that the decision to prosecute him for taking his three children out of school is a breach of the @entity191			0
a spokesman for the @entity134 said : ‘ given the fact that the premium for a typical holiday in @entity137 for a family of four could be as much as £ 1,347 more during school holidays compared with term - time , it ’s no wonder that parents are still tempted to face the ire of their children ’s head teacher , plus the threat of a fine , in order to save some significant cash			1
’ it looked at the cost of a holiday for a family of four with two children aged seven and nine for the first week in july , which is in term time , versus the first week in august			1
the cost of the same one week holiday in @entity137 rose from £ 1,508 to £ 2,855 , which is an increase of £ 1,347			2

the school did not confirm the reason for mr @entity223 's absence but parents said they found out he had gone to @entity180 for the @entity229			0
a spokesman for the school said mr @entity223 has never previously made a request for leave of absence and his attendance record has been ' exemplary			0
' but furious parents said he should be ' setting an example ' , especially when they could be fined for taking their children out of school			0
one even called on the head teacher to resign			0
businesswoman @entity252 , 42 , whose two sons attend @entity224 , said : ' i think it 's absolutely appalling			0
' he is headteacher , he was refused permission to do this at first and had to appeal to his union i hear			0
' he has a responsibility here for his pupils and he has neglected them			0
' he is supposed to be setting an example to not only the students but for parents , who themselves can not go to this kind of event			0
he ought to resign because of this			0
' @entity269 added : ' i do n't think it is right			0
we parents ca n't do it , can we , but he can go away when he wants			0
i think @entity276 should be taking a good look again at the school - his leadership should be in serious question now			0
' i want to know why the governors and powers that be thought that this would be ok			0

she returned to work on may 23 , three days before the summer half - term holiday starts			1
parents reacted with fury when they received a letter from governors telling them about her plans			0
one , @entity318 , said : ‘ as a parent of two boys at @entity321 , i find this disgusting			0
how can governors approve leave just after @entity293 when parents themselves can be fined for similar actions ? ' surely the summer time off she has is big enough to accommodate a wedding			2
’ miss @entity290 refused to comment .			0
