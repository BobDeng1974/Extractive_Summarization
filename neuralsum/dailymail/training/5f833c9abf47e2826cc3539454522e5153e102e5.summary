a prehistoric type of elephant had a second pair of tusks that they used to cut tough vegetation			1
@entity7 's bizarre jaw was used as an in - built ' scythe ' to saw off their food			2
they were originally believed to be water - living creatures that used their incisors to shovel and dig up food from swamps			0
@entity7 used their bizarre second tusks to cut tough vegetation after grabbing it with their trunk but further investigations into the fossilised tusks have changed the minds of scientists			1
vertebrate palaeontologist @entity23 , from the @entity24 , told @entity25 : ' recent analysis of tusk wear surfaces show that they were used more as scythes to cut tough vegetation			1
' cross-sections of tusks show in - built strength and resistance to abrasion , @entity25 reported			0
@entity7 lived between 8million and 20million years ago , in what is now @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38			1
they were successful and thrived at the time but died out during the @entity41			0
like the modern day elephant , it is believed the platybelodon grabbed tough vegetation with its trunk and sliced it off with its remarkable tusks			1
analysis of the tusks ( left ) of the @entity7 ( model , right ) had an in - built strength to resist abrasion @entity7 were slightly smaller than an @entity35 elephant and like their descendants had few predators because of their size			2
mr @entity23 told the website : ' the trunk is a very separate entity from the mouth			0
you have to be able to get food into your mouth , and if your front limbs are occupied in posture , and you have upper and lower tusks that would make it difficult to have a long projecting tongue or mobile lips , then you need a proboscis			0
' because they spent much of their time around water there are examples of platybelodon fossils .			0
