by @entity0 published : 05:58 est , 23 march 2012 updated : 07:16 est , 23 march 2012 a furious resident has had scaffolding erected at his house after workmen had a mix - up with their sat nav			1
@entity6 from @entity7 , @entity8 , returned home this week to find the structure encasing his home			1
his mother - in - law had spotted the workmen and told them they had got the wrong house			1
the wrong house : furious @entity6 came home to find his home covered in unwanted scaffolding however when she went to tell them , the scaffolders told her to go away and rang their boss who told them just to go ahead with it			2
the blunder is the latest in a string of mishaps on mr @entity6 ’s street , including wrongly delivered televisions , bailiff notices , beds and cookers			1
the mix - ups on @entity33 started three years ago when another @entity35 was built just eight miles away			1
both streets have an @entity38 postcode and many online maps , including @entity40 , and sat navs show the newly built one when the older one in @entity42 is searched for			1
mr @entity6 said : ‘ it has been ridiculous for a while			2
we ’ve been getting things for a long time now which are n’t for us			2
’ he phoned the people the scaffolding was intended for and asked them to sort out the problem			2
he does not know who put it up as they did not leave any note or acknowledgement			2
relieved : mr @entity6 is pleased when the scaffolding is taken down from his home in @entity7 , @entity58 another resident on the street , who asked not to be named , said she had been mistakenly threatened with action from bailiffs			1
the fed - up mother said that she and her neighbours have had beds , mattresses and electrical goods wrongly delivered to their houses			1
‘ i ’ve had more than enough now - we are all just sick of it , ’ she said			0
‘ it ’s just got to the point where we do n’t know what to do			0
i just want this to be sorted out			0
but the problem is that a lot of people are using sat navs these days			0
and as they are not programmed to accept that new address everything comes here instead			0
’ the correct address : @entity33 in @entity42 , where the scaffolding was supposed to go in the first place the @entity82 said the problem lay with individual companies and sat nav providers			0
a spokesman said that all the details , including postcodes and road names , were correct on its database , which was also accessible by visiting its website			0
he said : ‘ unfortunately , not everybody updates their own records			0
it would be their responsibility to do so			0
we have the correct records available			0
’ source of the confusion : windmill close in @entity42 and @entity33 in @entity7 are just eight miles apart			1

televisions and cookers also wrongly delivered on the street in @entity8
blunders started three years ago when a street was built just eight miles away with the same name
