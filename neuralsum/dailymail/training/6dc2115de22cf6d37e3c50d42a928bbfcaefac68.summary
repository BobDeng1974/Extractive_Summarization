by @entity0 published : 11:59 est , 22 march 2012 updated : 11:59 est , 22 march 2012 a new printer invented by @entity3 scientists sounds more like a gadget from @entity6 's @entity5 than something from an office supplies store			1
instead of printing pages it ' unprints ' them , turning out pristine , clean sheets which can even be reused			1
the device uses a green laser to heat up toner particles attached to fibres in the paper , causing them to evaporate			1

the laser works by quickly heating up toner particles attached to fibres in the paper , causing them to evaporate this means the paper can be reused - creating a massive boost for the environment by reducing carbon emissions and deforestation			1
early estimates predict the pioneering research could lower emissions in the paper and pulp industry by a staggering 50 per cent			1
dr @entity40 , who is leading the study at @entity3 , tested dozens of lasers to discover the perfect frequency , speed and energy			0
dr @entity46 said : ‘ what we need to do now is find someone to build a prototype			0
‘ thanks to hand - held scanners and laser - jet printers , the feasibility for reusing paper in the office is there			2
‘ material recovery through reusing eliminates the forestry step from the life cycle of paper and eradicates emissions arising from incineration and landfill dumping			0
’ the deletion process at work			0
the green laser ' scrubs ' paper clean so it can be reused dr @entity46 , the @entity3 scientist who has developed a technology to remove toner from a printed page with a laser scientists developing the tool believe by removing toner and reusing paper help cut the four steps from the paper production cycle - forestry , pulping , paper making and disposal by incineration or landfill			1
skipping these four steps would result in a whopping 95 per cent reduction in emissions per tonne produced from the production of office paper alone			2
@entity92 removal is 19 per cent more effective than recycling which only lowers omissions by 76 per cent			0
dr @entity46 added : ‘ this is a significant contribution towards the cause of reducing climate change emissions from paper manufacturing , but there is modest room from improvement			0

uses green laser to evaporate toner in printed pages
leaves clean sheet which can be reused
@entity6 gadget could reduce *pollution* from paper industry by 50 per cent
