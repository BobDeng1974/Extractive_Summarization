three white lion cubs born in @entity1 , @entity2 , have been adopted by a female dog after their mother refused to feed them			1
the cubs , born in late april , were abandoned by their mother and are now breast - fed by a dog together with a @entity9 tiger cub in the zoo			1
white lions are not actually a species in their own right , but are a variation of the @entity16 lion , with their colour caused by a recessive gene which is shared by both parents - like blue eyes in humans			2
three white lion cubs have been born in a zoo in @entity2 's southeastern province of @entity1 but were rejected by their mother the three cubs , along with a tiger cub , have now been given to a surrogate dog mother to look after until they are a bit older by giving the animals to a dog , instead of hand rearing them , keepers hop that the animals will eventually be able to rejoin their own kind contrary to popular belief , white lions are not albinos			1
their colour is caused by a mutation similar to albinism , but they lack the distinctive red eyes			0
it is not the first time the zoo , in @entity2 's southwest , have used a surrogate dog mother to adopt baby lions and tigers			0
in december last year they placed a pair of @entity9 tiger cubs with a stray dog from the nearby village after their mother refused to suckle them			1
they brought in the dog , named @entity59 , to act as their surrogate mother while still nursing her own newborn puppies			0
it is not the first time this zoo in @entity2 has given baby lions and tigers to a surrogate dog mother to look after , they did the same thing in december last year with two @entity9 tiger cubs while naturally occurring white lion cubs are rare , because the cause of their colour is genetic they can be bred for in zoos , leading to fears of interbreeding raising the cubs is hard work for a dog			1
as babies they require far less food than the 20lb their adult counterparts require , but it is still more than a baby dog the lions were born in late april , meaning they are just over a month old			0
it is usual for cubs to be separated from their dog surrogate before they are a year old and can start doing harm while young @entity9 tigers obviously do not eat as much as their adult counterparts - who need at least 9kg ( 20lb ) of food each day to survive - their appetites are certainly greater than that of the average puppy , making the task a difficult one for a dog			2
the technique is used to keep human animal interaction to a minimum so the animals can eventually be reintroduced with their own kind			0
in 2010 , a tiger cub called ' @entity106 ' was introduced to a litter of dogs after its mother refused to feed it			1
and other cross-species adoption has also been known to take place , with or without encouragement by zookeepers			0
white lions are thought to have been living in the @entity117 region of @entity118 for centuries , although the earliest recorded sighting was in 1938 once the cubs are older it is hoped they can be reintroduced to a pride of other lions as being reared by a dog means they will not be dependent on humans in 2010 , a tiger cub called ' @entity106 ' was introduced to a litter of dogs after its mother refused to feed it white lions are regarded as sacred animals in certain parts of @entity118 , but after @entity136 ' discovered ' them in the 1970s , many were taken from the wild to captive breeding and hunting operations in 2005 , a newborn squirrel was discovered in @entity141 having been adopted by a pregnant papillon dog called @entity143			1
in the same year @entity144 , a one - year - old orphaned hippo , was taken in by @entity146 , a 130 - year - old giant tortoise , in a @entity149 zoo			0
golden retriever @entity150 adopted three white bengal tiger cubs on a @entity154 ranch in 2008 – although they were separated for the dog ’s own safety when the big cats reached a year old			2
the species has been technically extinct fro 12 years , but has never officially been registered as endangered as they are not a separate species from the regular @entity16 lion in their natural habitat , white lions are regarded as ' apex predators ' , able to hunt successfully in day and night and take down prey as large as giraffes			0

three white lion cubs were born in april but when their mother refused to suckle them they were given to a dog
they are now being fed along with a @entity9 tiger cub who was also handed over to the dog to look after
it is hope that by using a dog to rear the cubs instead of humans , they can one day rejoin their own species
