by @entity1 reporter published : 07:24 est , 23 january 2013 updated : 11:13 est , 23 january 2013 an armour manufacturer has developed a whiteboard that doubles as a bulletproof shield , aimed at protecting children in the classroom			0
inventor @entity7 was driven to create the board in the aftermath of the @entity10 in @entity11 last year , in which 27 people were killed			1
the boards , measuring 18 by 20 inches , can stop a bullet from a handheld gun fired at pointblank range			1
the inventor hopes the boards can initially operate as teaching tools , but will be able to cover the head and torso in emergency situations			2
referring to shooting incidents at schools , mr @entity7 , said : ' it 's something i do n't think any @entity43 can tolerate anymore , and we 're in a position to do something about it			2
' the ceo of company @entity48 , added : ' i was like : alright , let 's take everything we got , see what we can throw at this problem , figure out an innovative solution			1
the boards , which weigh 1.7kg , have three rubberised handles on the back , allowing it to be held in front of the body			2
the white boards are similar to @entity48 's @entity62 vehicle technology , which is used to protect military convoys in @entity64 and @entity65			1
strong : a closeup of the board after ballistic testing shows how the bullets have been blocked by the shield the armor is created from polyethylene - based textile called @entity73			0
mr @entity7 said the boards could buy children and teachers time before the police arrive in possible emergency situations , acting as a last line of defence			1
he said : ' as teachers are doing their daily lesson plans , it 's in their hands			0
and if there 's a crisis , it 's in their hands			0
' teachers are not first responders , but sometimes they 're thrust into that role			0
' raft : the company says the boards , which can be used to rush attackers , are also able to float as they are less dense than water the inventor donated 90 of the products , valued at $ 20,000 ( Â£ 12,600 ) to @entity99 , where his children are schooled			1
headmaster @entity102 told @entity103 : the products he has provided for us , i have been able to ( provide ) widespread layered protection throughout all the buildings on our campus			0
' i 've had teachers say , every layer we add , it just makes people feel fundamentally a bit more secure			0

the whiteboards were designed by defence *equipment* supplier @entity118
@entity122 's ceo said @entity10 massacre *prompted* product design
