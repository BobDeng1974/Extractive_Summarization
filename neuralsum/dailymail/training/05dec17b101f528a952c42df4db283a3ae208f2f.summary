a @entity1 man has posted an advertisement for a haunted chair on @entity4			2
@entity5 from @entity6 in @entity1 picked up the wicker chair from hard rubbish two years ago and is hoping to sell it for $ 666			1
in the @entity4 advertisement , he describes the chair as a ' @entity12 chair haunted by [ a ] poltergeist '			1
a chair that is ' haunted by a poltergeist ' has been advertised for sale on @entity4 by a @entity1 seller ' after a week of having it in the house , i heard some crying during the night ( i thought i was dreaming ) , ' he writes in the item description			1
' then in the morning i noticed that the chair was on its side			2
i did n't connect the dots until it happened several times over two years			0
' sometimes there is laughing accompanied by tapping noises … the chair is always in a different spot afterwards ( moves up to three metres ) leaving shallow dent marks across the floor			0
' the advertisement also said the chair had ' severe scratch marks ' on the arms ' like someone has been aggressively dragging their fingernails '			1
mr @entity5 wrote that some repair work had been done on the piece , but it was not fully restored because he was ' too afraid to touch the chair '			2
the seller wrote on the item description that he frequently found the chair on its side after hearing crying and tapping bidding for the chair starts at $ 25 and the buy - it - now price is $ 666 ' i would be glad to get rid of it and pass it on to someone who has had experience with this kind of thing			1
please help ! ! ! ’ the opening bid for the chair is set at $ 25 , though a keen purchaser can buy it now for $ 666			1
as yet there have been no bids placed on the item , but 16 people are watching it and the advertisement gets more than 100 views a day			0
mr @entity5 , who is an artist , told @entity65 that the advertisement ' was meant to be a bit of theatre ’			0
' people get so caught up in [ supernatural things ] that they want to make it true , they believe what they want to believe			0
it was a bit of experiment in human behaviour and human psychology , ’ he said			0
mr @entity5 says that if the chair does not sell he will reinvent the chair as something else and list it again			2
' that could be fun , the changing personality of this chair			0
