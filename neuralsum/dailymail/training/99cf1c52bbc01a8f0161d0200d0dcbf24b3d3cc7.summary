by @entity0 published : 12:20 est , 19 august 2013 updated : 12:44 est , 19 august 2013 when 5ft waves were suddenly seen rising from the @entity5 - @entity4 fjord in @entity6 , locals were terrified			2
they described the event , which occurred in 2011 , as ‘ like a maelstrom ’ and as if ‘ the sea was boiling			0
’ some captured the waves on their mobile phones , watching the water ebb and flow to great heights for several hours at a time			2
now , a new study has revealed that the mystery waves were in fact made by the huge magnitude - 9.0 earthquake that devastated @entity21 in 2011			2
often they are caused by strong winds , but in some cases they can also be created by earthquakes thousands of miles away			1
experts initially thought the waves in 2011 were caused by an underwater landslide			2
but the explanation did n’t account for reports of coastal flooding at the same time in other fjords in @entity6			0
the freak waves , known as seiches , can occur in any landlocked body of water , such as a lake , for a variety of reasons			1
often they are caused by strong winds , but in some cases they can also be created by earthquakes thousands of miles away long , slow waves are known as seiches			1
they can occur in any landlocked body of water , such as a lake and are often by strong winds			1
in some cases they can be created by earthquakes thousands of miles away			1
@entity6 fjords are particularly sensitive to the natural occurrence because of their great depths			0
back in 1950 , the @entity71 earthquake triggered waves in 29 fjords in @entity6 and in @entity75 reservoirs			1
however , the latest finding is the first known recording of @entity6 seiches caused by an earthquake for over half a century			1
fjords pointing northeast toward @entity21 , in five towns , started moving half an hour after the @entity21 earthquake and continued to do so for almost three hours			0
‘ i realised there must be a connection with the big earthquake in @entity21 , ’ @entity23 , a geologist at @entity24 in @entity25 , told livescience			0
‘ i was so excited i could n't sleep that night thinking about it			0
’ @entity23 and his team used videos taken by eye witnesses and built a computer model to test their theory by timing the ebb and flow of the oscillations			0
he found that these seiches were triggered from horizontal s waves caused by the 2011 @entity100 earthquake			1
an s - wave is a seismic body wave that shakes the ground back and forth perpendicular to the direction the wave is moving			0
mr @entity23 claims that in fjords pointed northeast , the s - waves from the @entity21 earthquake moved the ground back and forth by 0.4 inches			0
according to researchers , @entity6 fjords are particularly sensitive to the natural occurrence because of their great depths			0
back in 1950 , the @entity71 earthquake triggered waves in 29 fjords in @entity6 and in @entity75 reservoirs			1
however , the latest finding is the first known recording of @entity6 seiches caused by an earthquake for over half a century			1
@entity5 - @entity4 fjord in @entity6 where seiches occured two years ago			2
at the time , locals were shocked and frightened describing the event as ' like a maelstrom ' and as if ' the sea was boiling '			0

the waves , known as seiches , can occur in any landlocked body of water
they are sometimes triggered by earthquakes thousands of miles away
this is the first known recording of @entity6 seiches caused by an earthquake for over half a century
