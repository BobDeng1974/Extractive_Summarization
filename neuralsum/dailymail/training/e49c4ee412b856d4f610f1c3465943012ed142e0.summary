by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 02:55 est , 13 may 2013 updated : 09:50 est , 13 may 2013 most of lazy @entity5 ’s problems are not caused by the @entity6 and would not be solved by cutting ties with @entity8 , @entity2 has warned			1
the @entity10 mayor said the culture of ‘ easy gratification ’ , low skills and ‘ sloth ’ would have to be addressed instead of being blamed on ‘ @entity15 ’ if the @entity5 back withdrawal			0
talks to get a better deal with the @entity6 meant @entity5 had to make clear it is ‘ willing to walk away ’ , even though it may not be in the national interest , he added			2
@entity10 mayor @entity2 called for early legislation to guarantee a referendum on @entity5 leaving the @entity6 mr @entity2 ’s intervention comes after two @entity24 cabinet ministers said they would vote to leave the @entity6 if a referendum was held now			1
defence secretary @entity26 and education secretary @entity27 broke ranks to publicly say they favoured withdrawal , with up to seven more senior ministers also wanting to exit			1
@entity32 has promised that if he is prime minister after the 2015 election he would renegotiate a new settlement with @entity8 , before staging an in - out referendum			1
however pressure is mounting on the @entity37 to bring forward legislation sooner to firm up his commitment			0
@entity32 is in @entity40 for talks with @entity43 president @entity42 , but the trip has been overshadowed by questions over @entity24 splits back home over @entity47 some @entity24 mps want a referendum before 2015 , but their @entity51 coalition partners are opposed			1
on wednesday up to 100 conservative backbenchers are expected to back a motion criticising the @entity54 for failing to commit to a referendum , in an unprecedented revolt			1
mr @entity32 will miss the vote because he is on a visit to the @entity43			2
mr @entity2 said he supported mr @entity32 ’s plan , but added : ‘ i personally back legislation now to make sure that referendum goes ahead			1
’ should @entity32 bring forward the @entity6 referendum ? in his @entity64 column he added : ‘ if we left the @entity6 , we would end this sterile debate , and we would have to recognise that most of our problems are not caused by “ @entity15 ” , but by chronic @entity5 short - termism , inadequate management , sloth , low skills , a culture of easy gratification and under - investment in both human and physical capital and infrastructure			1
’ mr @entity2 said mr @entity32 will only be able to extract concession from @entity8 if there is a realistic prospect of @entity5 quitting altogether			2
' this renegotiation can only work if we understand clearly what we want to achieve : a pared - down relationship based on free trade and cooperation , ' he added			2
' and our partners will only take us seriously if they think we will invoke @entity87 , and pull out , if we fail to get what we want			0
if we are going to have any chance of success in the negotiations , we need to show that the @entity5 is willing to walk away			0
' however , @entity93 leader @entity92 said mr @entity32 faced an ' issue of trust ' over his commitment to overhaul @entity5 's relationship with @entity47			1
he said the @entity98 made a ' cast iron ' promise top hold a referendum on the @entity102 , which had not happened			2
@entity93 leader @entity92 said the @entity98 face an ' issue of trust ' over @entity47 mr @entity92 said : ' no parliament can bind its successor			1
even if a piece of legislation was passed in this parliament to say there would be a referendum in the next parliament that has no force of law whatsoever			2
' the real problem is that mr @entity32 made a promise a few years ago , he said ‘ i give you this cast iron guarantee that if i become prime minister there ’ll be a referendum on the @entity123 treaty ’ and he did n’t deliver			1
the real problem that the conservative party have got with him is an issue of trust , people really do n’t believe he intends to deliver , ' he told @entity126			0
' this is merely an attempt to kick the issue into the long grass to neutralise the @entity47 question at the next general election and to try to get @entity93 off the @entity24 ’s back			1
i do n’t want to wait for up to five years to have a referendum on something as fundamentally important as this			0
' senior @entity24 ministers upped the ante by calling saying they would back withdrawal if a referendum was held now			1
exit strategy : education secretary @entity27 ( left ) and defence secretary @entity26 both said they would vote for @entity5 to leave @entity47 if there was a referendum tomorrow asked whether he thought @entity5 should leave the @entity6 if there were a referendum today , mr @entity27 told the @entity148 ’s @entity147 : ‘ yes , i ’m not happy with our position in the @entity6			1
but my preference is for a change in @entity5 ’s relationship with the @entity6			0
‘ my ideal is what the majority of the @entity5 public ’s ideal is , which is to recognise the current situation is no good , to say that life outside would be perfectly tolerable , we could contemplate it , there would be certain advantages			0
' but the best deal for @entity47 , and for @entity5 , would be if @entity5 were to lead the change that @entity47 needs			2
’ ‘ my own view is , let the prime minister lay out our negotiating strategy , make sure he has a majority – which i am convinced he will secure at the next election – and let ’s have the referendum then			0
' after mr @entity27 ’s interview , mr @entity26 , asked on the @entity148 ’s @entity176 radio programme whether he would vote to leave the @entity6 as things stand , replied : ‘ yes , because i believe that we have to negotiate a better solution that works better for @entity5 if we are going to stay in and play a part in the @entity6 in the future			1
‘ but let me be absolutely clear : i think it is defeatist to sort of say we want to leave the @entity6			2
today @entity24 mp @entity183 , mr @entity27 's parliamentary aide , said he would be voting for the amendment to the @entity54 expressing ' regret ' at the absence of a referendum			1
' i completely support the policy that was set out by the prime minister in january but what we need to do is to convince a sceptical electorate that we actually mean it , ' he told the @entity195 4 today programme			0
' the electorate at the moment does n't have a great deal of trust in politicians in general and many people feel they have been promised referenda in the past and they have n't happened			0
' so this is n't an issue about @entity206 trusting @entity32			2
it 's about using the legislative process to convince the electorate that the clear commitment he gave in his speech is going to happen			0
' but @entity24 former foreign secretary sir @entity213 attacked the ' poor judgment ' of the leaders of the rebellion			0
' sometimes it is necessary to split your party on a great issue of principle but to split your party on an issue of tactics seems to me pretty odd , ' he told @entity226			0
' what they are doing is putting the prime minister in an impossible situation			0
he can not simply vote for this amendment because it would split the @entity233 down the middle			0
at the same time , the motion can not win because there is not a parliamentary majority for it			0

@entity240 backs @entity32 's renegotiation plan but calls for early legislation to guarantee in - out referendum
@entity27 and @entity26 lead @entity245 calls to leave @entity6 if vote held now
@entity24 mps to vote against @entity250 's speech in unprecedented revolt
@entity93 's @entity92 says @entity98 have an ' issue of trust ' over @entity47
