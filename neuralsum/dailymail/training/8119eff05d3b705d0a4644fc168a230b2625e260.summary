by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 may have got their @entity4 campaign off to a winning start against @entity6 on monday but it appears not everyone was impressed			1
@entity9 own goal gave @entity2 the perfect start after three minutes before they scored arguably one of the best goals of the tournament - an incisive passing move that was deftly finished off by @entity15 for his first goal at a @entity4			1
despite the positive result , one @entity18 paper was still fairly damning about their performance			0
bold : @entity18 newspaper slam @entity2 's performance in their victory over @entity6 on monday @entity26 - based paper @entity24 boldly declared : ' is that all you 've got ? @entity2 play badly and need an own goal to beat @entity6			1
oh , and @entity15 scored a goal '			0
@entity18 and @entity2 are , of course , great rivals so @entity24 's stance may be slightly biased , but there 's no denying @entity2 were not at their vintage best against @entity6			2
that being said , however , @entity2 - along with @entity18 - are many people 's tips to make it all the way to the final and surely will improve as the tournament progresses			0
but the question is , will @entity24 come to regret their front page on july 13 .			0

@entity2 beat @entity6 2 - 1 on monday with @entity15 scoring the second
@entity26 based paper @entity24 however *remain* *unimpressed* with the @entity47 despite @entity4 2014 opener win
