by @entity1 reporter published : 08:08 est , 18 november 2013 updated : 09:47 est , 18 november 2013 a small stable year in rural @entity2 is not necessarily the place where you might expect to find gold			2
but that is exactly what happened when @entity10 's only gold @entity9 colt was born there last spring			2
now 18 - months - old @entity11 is a remarkable example of his extremely rare breed - made even more so by the fact that he was born with green eyes			1
@entity16 , pictured with his owner @entity17 , is a remarkable example of his extremely rare breed - made even more so by the fact that he has green eyes born in march last year , @entity23 , is known as @entity24 which means gold in @entity26 , where the breed originally comes from			1
but @entity28 is doubly rare as thanks to a genetic quirk he has two copies of the ' pearl ' colour gene , one from both his mother and father			2
and he has become an internet sensation with almost 200,000 fans of his @entity41 page where his owner posts pictures and updates about his activities			1
@entity46 , 57 , who owns @entity24 , also works as a mediator in the shipping industry and has been involved in helping to free hostages from @entity51 pirates			0

golden : @entity16 is also known as @entity24 which means gold in @entity26 where his breed originally comes from she told the @entity60 : ' i was absolutely overjoyed when @entity11 was born			1
' the stud phoned me because he had green eyes and they kept on saying : " we 've never seen anything like it			1
" ' everyone who came up to the stud had to have a look at this horse with such an odd colour			0
every time the vet goes to the yard he takes all his students to look			0
' he is just this extraordinary colour and has the most weird sheen on his coat , even when he 's dirty			0
' she also explained how the horse came to have his ' double ' pearl gene			0
double trouble : @entity16 is doubly rare as thanks to a genetic quirk he has two copies of the ' pearl ' colour gene , one from both his mother and father @entity11 @entity95 attraction : @entity16 has become a hit with both visitors to his stables and online horse fans with nearly 200,000 followers on his @entity41 site she added : ' to produce this kind of horse you need two copies of the pearl gene			1
i bought a mare and purely by chance she had one copy of the gene			0
' then i found a stallion with two copies of the gene so i was guaranteed that one copy would come over			0
but i had only a 50 - 50 chance that the mare would pass the other copy over and so basically the first time i really tried , i pulled it off and bred @entity11			1
' @entity16 was born with green eyes and a bright blond mane but over time that has darkened slightly and his eyes are now hazel			1
there are believed to be around 185,000 @entity9 or @entity131 horses registered worldwide			0
their ancestors have lived in @entity134 for thousands of years and since the breed was recognised in the fifteenth century the characteristics have changed very little and been prized by the nobility for their prowess as a war horses .			0
