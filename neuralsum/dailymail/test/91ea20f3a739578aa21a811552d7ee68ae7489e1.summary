the @entity0 launched a legal attack on @entity2 on wednesday , stoking tensions with @entity4 as it accused the @entity6 gas giant of overcharging buyers in @entity8 and hindering competition @entity11 antitrust chief @entity10 ( pictured ) said @entity2 was barring @entity0 clients from selling on its gas to otherstates state - controlled @entity2 is a vital supplier of energy to @entity8 despite the @entity0 's frequent political disputes with @entity4			1
the @entity11 's investigation , opened in september 2012 , had initially covered @entity30 , the @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity37			0
relations with @entity6 , and @entity2 in particular , have since been poisoned more by the @entity40 confrontation over @entity17			2
' @entity2 is dominant in all these markets , ' @entity41 told a news conference			0
' our preliminary view alleges that @entity2 is abusing this position			0
' ' @entity2 has been able to charge higher prices in some countries without fearing that ... gas would flow in from where prices were lower , ' she said of contracts with the three @entity56 @entity55 states and formerly communist @entity30 and @entity34			2
@entity10 said prices in some countries were as much as 40 per cent higher than in others			0
@entity37 president @entity60 welcomed the charges , saying : ' the era of @entity64 - backed political and economic blackmail draws to a close			1
' @entity6 foreign minister @entity20 said that the charges were ' absolutely unacceptable ' noting the investigation had begun before @entity6 annexed @entity67 from @entity17 , @entity10 said ' this case is not political ' but acknowledged some would see political elements in it			1
@entity2 responded by calling the charges , to which it has 12 weeks to respond , ' unfounded ' and saying it expected a resolution within the framework of previous undertakings between the @entity64 and @entity74 ' on the intergovernmental level '			2
@entity6 foreign minister @entity20 said on wednesday that the @entity0 charges against @entity2 were an unacceptable attempt to retroactively apply the bloc 's latest energy rules to earlier contracts			1
asked to comment on the case , @entity20 said in an interview with three radio stations : ' all contracts in effect now that @entity2 signed with its partners , were signed with full respect of the legal regime that existed in the @entity0 at the time			1
' after the @entity0 adopted the so - called third energy package ... there have been attempts , and they continue now , to retrospectively , retroactively apply those requirements to old contracts as well			2
' the @entity0 has brokered deals to keep gas flowing to @entity17 despite the conflict between @entity100 and @entity4 , but efforts to supply gas via eastern @entity0 states have been hindered by contracts with @entity2 that prohibit the re-export of @entity6 gas			1
@entity2 had also pressured @entity30 and @entity34 into accepting unfavourable terms over gas pipeline control and construction , the commissioner said			2
the decision to move against @entity2 comes a week after @entity10 charged @entity113 tech giant @entity112 with abusing its market power , following five years of hesitation by her predecessor			0
she said , however , that in other cases she would be willing to negotiate with firms without pressing charges			0
the @entity120 has appeared determined to challenge big corporate powers since taking on the powerful post in november , regardless of past offers of compromise from both @entity112 and @entity2			0
despite insisting she would look only at the legal merits of a case that focuses on @entity2 's pricing policies for different customers , the accusations will not ease frictions with @entity4 over @entity17 in which gas supplies have played a major role			0
@entity2 offered concessions to @entity10 's predecessor last year in a bid to settle the case and avoid a possible fine but talks failed over its refusal to cut prices in eastern @entity8			0
the @entity6 behemoth , with annual sales of some $ 100 billion , supplies about 30 per cent of the 28 - nation @entity0 's natural gas			1
it has been under investigation since september 2012 , including for hampering the flow of gas across @entity8			0
@entity10 can order companies to change their business practices and is theoretically able to levy fines of up to 10 per cent of their annual global turnover .			0
