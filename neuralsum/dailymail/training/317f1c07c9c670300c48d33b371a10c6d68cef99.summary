by @entity0 published : 06:00 est , 30 april 2012 updated : 05:22 est , 1 may 2012 two brothers have developed an age - reversing disease , which has abruptly halted their adulthood and instead leaves them behaving like young children			1
@entity5 , 39 , and @entity6 , 42 , both had jobs and were able to have normal relationships until their mannerisms became more and more childlike - just like in the film the @entity12			1
they have now been forced to move back home with their parents in @entity17 and @entity19 regiment @entity20 is now estimated to have a mental age of 10 and is said to giggle constantly			1
rare disease : @entity5 , right , 39 , and @entity6 , 42 , now spend their days living at home with their parents and playing with toys as their mental age continues to regress while factory worker @entity5 , whose 19 - year - old daughter @entity28 is expecting a baby , behaves much like a toddler			1
after their behaviour started to change , the brothers were eventually diagnosed with terminal leukodystrophy last year			1
the condition usually only affects newborns , and is so rare there are only 100 people affected in the whole of the @entity39			1
tragic : @entity40 and @entity41 , with their sons @entity5 ( left ) , and @entity20 , at their home in @entity17			1
the brothers were only diagnosed with terminal leukodystophy last year leukodystrophy is a neurological disease which affects the brain , nervous system and the spinal cord			1
their form of the disease mirrors the plot of the film @entity57 , based on the @entity59 novel , in which an old man constantly gets younger , rather than growing old - although the brothers physical appearance is not changing			1
the brothers ' devastated parents @entity40 , 63 , and @entity41 , 61 , told how they had to abandon their dream retirement in @entity66 to come back to @entity17 and look after their sons			1
@entity40 said an average day for the family now consisted of entertaining is adult boys with board games , cartoons and comics			2
he said : ' both the boys like cartoons , especially the @entity75 and @entity76 , and the types of films they like to watch has changed to those aimed at children			2
' @entity5 loved the first @entity81 , but he did n't like the second and third one and like a kid if he does n't like it he just gets up and leaves or turns it off			2
regression : @entity90 , left , aged around 12 and @entity6 on his 16th birthday - their behaviour now mirrors their childhood years leukodystrophy is a neurological disease which affects the brain , nervous system and the spinal cord			1
the condition usually only affects newborns , and is so rare there are only 100 people affected in the whole of the @entity39			1
leukodystrophies are mostly inherited disorders , meaning that it is passed on from parent to child			2
the @entity108 funds research into the disease			2
ceo of @entity112 's @entity39 arm , @entity113 , said : ' there is an estimated one in three billion chance of two people who carry the gene deficiency meeting and becoming partners			1
' the chances of the children developing the condition are dependant on what type of leukodystrophy the parents have			1
if both have the recessive gene then there is a one in four chance of the children having the disease			2
' if only the mother has the gene every boy born would have a form of leukodystrophy			1
of course it 's important to say there are 37 known types of the disease at the moment but doctors are diagnosing new forms which simply have not been catalogued yet and named			2
' the word leukodystrophy comes from the @entity144 words leuko ( meaning white ) , trophy ( meaning growth ) , and dys ( meaning ill )			1
the words put together , form leukodystrophy - a set of diseases that affect the growth or maintenance of the white matter ( myelin )			1
all leukodystrophies are a result of problems with the growth or maintenance of the myelin sheath - so far about forty different types of leukodystrophy have been identified			1
' at the moment they really like snakes and ladders and @entity168 but other games like @entity169 we 've bought them are proving too difficult			2
' in terms of diet they both love crisps but we have tried to improve their eating habits			2
' after moving to @entity180 in 2007 @entity20 and @entity5 's parents began to notice unusual things about their sons			2
@entity40 usually spoke to @entity5 and @entity20 once a week and sent a text most days to the pair			2
@entity5 was still in full - time employment but had split from his wife whereas @entity20 was not working since being medically discharged from the @entity187 after falling and damaging his knee			1
@entity20 went on to qualify as a cabinet maker but today his talents are lost			2
@entity40 said : ' it was little things at first , not replying to a text , or not answering their phones			2
but then we would n't hear from them for weeks			0
' when i did finally get hold of @entity20 he told me he had n't had any credit which was odd because that was n't like him			0
' @entity40 said things came to a head when he received a phone call from his granddaughter @entity28 last year			0
he said : ' she told me she had a call from someone at the @entity209 about @entity20 asking for her dad @entity5 's details			0
it was then that we found out @entity5 had lost his job			0
' he was so confused about what to do he had been sitting in a room with just a candle at night and no food or electricity for two weeks because he did n't know how to claim benefits			0
he was as helpless as a child			0
' @entity40 , who worked in the prison service for 22 years , said : ' it is a devastating disease			0
' both of them are very childlike now			0
@entity5 went out the other day and bought himself a train set and a mr @entity226			0
before the disease : @entity229 regiment @entity20 , left , is now estimated to have a mental age of 10 and is said to giggle constantly , while @entity5 , right was fired from his job as a factory worker after his behaviour changed ' he also has these awful episodes where he screams and shouts and says ' i do n't know what i 'm doing '			0
' it is like an adult having a toddler 's tantrum			0
it 's obviously worse for him but it is terrible for us too			0
' there 's nothing we can do to help and we feel absolutely powerless			0
' mr and mrs @entity41 came back to the @entity39 in january to look after their sons who now need full time care			1
mr @entity6 told how the brothers ' lives began to unravel after their symptoms started to become more pronounced			0
unusual : the disease mirrors the plot of the film @entity57 , based on the @entity59 novel , in which an old man played by @entity259 , pictured , constantly gets younger , rather than growing old he added : ' @entity20 was evicted from his flat because he stopped looking after himself			0
if he dropped something it would stay there and he stopped doing the dishes			0
' @entity5 was fired from his job as a factory worker , and although we do n't know the full story we can only assume it is because he was behaving like a child			0
' @entity20 moved into @entity5 's flat after the eviction but left shortly after a row with a neighbour , believing he was being told to leave			0
after sleeping in a park for three weeks he found a soup kitchen who sent him to the @entity278			0
mr @entity6 said : ' they knew something was wrong at once and they sent him to a doctor			0
' the doctors carried out an mri scan and they discovered the condition			0
when they asked him if he had any siblings he said he had a brother and they ran tests on @entity5 and discovered he had the same thing			0
the @entity108 funds research into the disease in an attempt to find treatments and , ultimately , a cure for conditions such as leukodystrophy as there is little knowledge of the illness			1
ceo of @entity112 's @entity39 arm , @entity113 , said : ' there is an estimated one in three billion chance of two people who carry the gene deficiency meeting and becoming partners			1
' the chances of the children developing the condition are dependant on what type of leukodystrophy the parents have			1
if both have the recessive gene then there is a one in four chance of the children having the disease			0
' if only the mother has the gene every boy born would have a form of leukodystrophy			1
