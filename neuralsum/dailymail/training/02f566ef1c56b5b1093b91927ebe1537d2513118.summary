by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 14:36 est , 28 january 2014 updated : 15:08 est , 28 january 2014 another state now has a bill to consider about bringing firing squads back as an option for prisoners on death row			1
lawmakers in @entity10 are the latest to debate the issue as they try to come up with a solution in response to the dwindling supplies of lethal injection drugs			1
the squads are not the only relics from a more gruesome past that are under consideration , as electrocutions and gas chambers have also been suggested			1
most states abandoned those execution methods more than a generation ago in a bid to make capital punishment more palatable to the public and to a judicial system worried about inflicting cruel and unusual punishments that violate the @entity30			2
modern day firing squad : this is the execution chamber at @entity33 where a firing squad lines up and kills the seated prisoner but to some elected officials , the drug shortages and recent legal challenges are beginning to make lethal injection seem too vulnerable to complications			1
' this is n't an attempt to time - warp back into the 1850s or the wild , @entity45 or anything like that , ' said @entity10 state rep. @entity48 , who this month proposed making firing squads an option for executions			1
' it 's just that i foresee a problem , and i 'm trying to come up with a solution that will be the most humane yet most economical for our state			2
' @entity48 , a @entity58 , said questions about the injection drugs are sure to end up in court , delaying executions and forcing states to examine alternatives			1
it 's not fair , he said , for relatives of murder victims to wait years , even decades , to see justice served while lawmakers and judges debate execution methods			2
@entity10 's attorney general and a state lawmaker have raised the notion of rebuilding the state 's gas chamber			1
earlier this month , a @entity78 lawmaker offered a bill allowing the firing squad			1
what remains : four of the bullet holes from the killing of @entity84 on june 18 , 2010 are seen in the wood of the @entity33 's firing squad contraption and a @entity89 lawmaker wants to make electrocution an option if lethal - injection drugs are n't available			1
if adopted , those measures could return states to the more harrowing imagery of previous decades , when inmates were hanged , electrocuted or shot to death by marksmen			2
states began moving to lethal injection in the 1980s in the belief that powerful sedatives and heart - stopping drugs would replace the violent spectacles with a more clinical affair while limiting , if not eliminating , an inmate 's pain			2
' this is n't an attempt to time - warp back into the 1850s or the wild , @entity45 or anything like that , ' said @entity10 state rep. @entity48 the total number of @entity117 executions has declined in recent years â € ” from a peak of 98 in 1999 to 39 last year			1
some states have turned away from the death penalty entirely			2
many have cases tied up in court			0
and those that carry on with executions find them increasingly difficult to conduct because of the scarcity of drugs and doubts about how well they work			0
in recent years , @entity131 drug makers have stopped selling the lethal chemicals to prisons because they do not want their products used to kill			2
at least two recent executions are also raising concerns about the drugs ' effectiveness			0
last week , @entity140 inmate @entity139 took 26 minutes to die by injection , gasping repeatedly as he lay on a gurney with his mouth opening and closing			0
and on @entity148 9 , @entity147 inmate @entity146 's final words were , ' i feel my whole body burning			2
' @entity10 threw out its three - drug lethal injection procedure after it could no longer obtain the drugs			2
state officials altered the method in 2012 to use propofol , which was found in the system of pop star @entity158 after he died of an overdose in 2009			0
the anti-death penalty @entity161 threatened to impose export limits on propofol if it were used in an execution , jeopardizing the supply of a common anesthetic needed by hospitals across the nation			0
in october , governor @entity169 stayed the execution of serial killer @entity171 and ordered the @entity172 to find a new drug			0
days later , the state announced it had switched to a form of pentobarbital made by a compounding pharmacy			0
like other states , @entity10 has refused to divulge where the drug comes from or who makes it			2
running into problems : a number of states have had problems securing the chemicals used in lethal injections so @entity189 said that he thought firing squads - like those used in @entity33 - were the next most humane option @entity10 has carried out two executions using pentobarbital â € ” @entity171 in november and @entity195 in december			1
neither inmate showed outward signs of suffering , but the secrecy of the process resulted in a lawsuit and a legislative inquiry			0
@entity202 , assistant professor of criminal justice at the @entity204 , said some lawmakers simply do n't believe convicted murderers deserve any mercy			0
' many of these politicians are trying to tap into a more populist theme that those who do terrible things deserve to have terrible things happen to them , ' @entity202 said			0
@entity214 , executive director of the @entity215 in @entity216 , cautioned that there could be a backlash			0
reverting back : @entity189 , a @entity58 state senator in @entity78 , said that if the chemicals used in lethal injections are not available , the state should use firing squads ' these ideas would jeopardize the death penalty because , i think , the public reaction would be revulsion , at least from many quarters , ' @entity214 said			1
some states already provide alternatives to lethal injection			2
condemned prisoners may choose the electric chair in eight states : @entity235 , @entity236 , @entity237 , @entity238 , @entity147 , @entity239 , @entity240 and @entity89			0
an inmate named @entity242 was the most recent to die by electrocution , in @entity89 in january 2013			0
@entity244 , @entity10 and @entity78 allow for gas - chamber executions			1
@entity10 no longer has a gas chamber , but attorney general @entity247 , a @entity248 , and @entity10 state sen. @entity249 , a @entity58 , last year suggested possibility rebuilding one			1
so far , there is no bill to do so			0
@entity254 , @entity255 and @entity256 still allow inmates to choose hanging			0
the last hanging in the @entity117 was @entity260 in @entity254 in 1996			0
two prisoners in @entity256 have chosen to be hanged since the 1990s â € ” @entity262 in 1993 and @entity263 in 1994			0
firing squads typically consisting of five sharpshooters with rifles , one of which is loaded with a blank so the shooters do not know for sure who fired the fatal bullet			1
they have been used mostly for military executions			0
since the end of the @entity277 , there have been three civilian firing squad executions in the @entity117 , all in @entity33			1
@entity279 uttered his famous final words , ' @entity281 ' on jan. 18 , 1977 , before his execution , which ended what amounted to a 17 - year national moratorium on the death penalty			0
convicted killers @entity287 in 1996 and @entity84 in 2010 were also put to death by firing squad			1
@entity290 is phasing out its use , but the firing squad remains an option there for inmates sentenced prior to may 3 , 2004			1
@entity147 maintains the firing squad as an option , but only if lethal injection and electrocution are deemed unconstitutional			1
in @entity78 , @entity58 state senator @entity189 said death by firing squad would be far less expensive than building a gas chamber			1
@entity78 has only one inmate on death row , 68 - year - old convicted killer @entity304			1
the state has not executed anyone in 22 years			0
@entity307 , a @entity58 in the @entity308 , is sponsoring a bill that would allow for electrocution if lethal injection drugs are not available			0
@entity307 said he would prefer that the state have easy access to the drugs needed for lethal injections			1
' but i also believe that the process of the justice system needs to be fulfilled			0

@entity10 state *representative* @entity48 has proposed the move to allow firing squads
the state 's attorney general already suggest rebuilding gas chambers
a @entity78 state senator said firing squads would be less expensive
comes as many states are having problems getting the rare chemicals needed to perform lethal injections
@entity33 has an operating firing squad room used to kill death row inmates
