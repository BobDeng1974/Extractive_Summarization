@entity0 under 19s made the perfect start to their @entity3 qualifying campaign as they twice came from behind to beat @entity4 3 - 2 on thursday night			1
@entity6 's @entity5 trailed twice , to goals from @entity8 and @entity9 , but hit back through @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 to claim an important win			1
@entity0 are in an @entity15 mini-group with @entity4 , @entity16 and @entity17 as they bid to reach the @entity19 19 @entity3 finals in @entity20 in july			1
@entity21 's @entity12 scored the winner as @entity0 's under 19s beat @entity4 with only the group winners qualifying for the tournament , it was imperative @entity0 started with a positive result in @entity28 , northern @entity17 and they did in a topsy - turvy game that saw both sides finish with 10 men			1
having scored 15 goals in three matches against @entity34 , @entity35 and @entity36 to breeze through the preliminary qualifying phase , @entity0 knew this week 's fixture would represent a step up in quality			2
and they were rocked when @entity4 took the lead just six minutes in - after the @entity0 defence failed to deal with a long throw - in , @entity8 was there to poke the ball home at the back post			2
@entity0 responded by seizing control of possession , but it was the half - hour mark before they equalised			0
@entity53 midfielder @entity52 threaded a ball through to club - mate @entity12 and , brushing aside two @entity4 defenders , he slotted the ball past goalkeeper @entity57			1
@entity12 came within inches of putting @entity0 in front soon after , but his powerful strike from 20 yards cannoned back off the crossbar			0
@entity10 , seen here playing for @entity53 in the @entity62 , scored @entity0 's first goal and when @entity66 star @entity65 teed up @entity67 , his shot was cleared off the line by @entity69			1
given their dominance , it was frustrating that @entity4 took the lead again four minutes before half - time			0
after a well - worked move , @entity9 found space just outside the box and fired past goalkeeper @entity78 into the far corner			0
to their credit , @entity0 responded immediately and it was 2 - 2 at the pause			2
@entity65 swung in a free - kick from the right and @entity11 , the @entity85 player , flicked in at the near post			0
after the excitement of the opening 45 minutes , the game entered a lull after the break before exploding to life again in the decisive final 10 minutes			0
@entity21 defender @entity12 collected the ball wide right , cut inside and fired home a missile from 20 yards that crashed in off the underside of the bar			0
the game ended with @entity0 's @entity98 receiving a second yellow card and @entity4 's @entity100 also dismissed for a bad tackle on @entity102			0
