doctors are working on a genetically modified gene to help treat babies with a painful skin disorder			1
file photo youngsters who suffer from a rare and incurable disorder that causes chronic skin inflammation have been given hope for the future in the form of a genetically modified graft			1
children with @entity13 , a painful skin condition , have a missing gene , and trials are under way of a treatment that replaces it			1
a small section of skin is taken from the patient , and manipulated in a lab where a gene containing a protein is added			2
the protein promotes stronger , healthier skin and , it is hoped , will boost protein levels throughout the body			2
@entity13 affects one in every 800,000 people , with a handful of cases in the @entity32			1
babies born with it often have red , ‘ scalded - looking ’ skin that peels easily			0
one sufferer in ten does not live to see his or her first birthday			0
the condition also affects the immune system and hair growth , resulting in it being fragile and slow - growing			0
children with @entity13 are more susceptible to dehydration , infection and allergies , and are smaller and lighter than healthy children			1
now doctors at @entity53 and @entity54 ’s and @entity55 ’ hospitals in @entity49 , who are behind the trials , say the graft could bring relief for those with the disorder			0
‘ @entity13 has a huge impact on people ’s lives , ’ says dr @entity60 , a consultant in the dermatology department of @entity53			1
‘ skin is inflamed , sore and peeling , and you can be open to infection			0
if successful , the skin grafts could potentially offer the first treatment for the condition rather than just managing the symptoms			2
’ people with @entity13 are lacking a gene called @entity74 , which contains a protein known as lekti , usually found in the skin			1
the protein plays an important role in the immune system by producing white blood cells called lymphocytes , which help the body respond to infection			0
the lifelong condition usually improves as people get older , and some drugs and regular gentle washing and moisturising can help with symptoms			0
doctors at @entity53 , pictured , and @entity54 ’s and @entity55 ’ @entity48 in @entity49 , say the graft could bring relief for those with @entity13 the new graft involves taking a quarter - inch skin biopsy from the inside of the patient ’s arm			1
this is processed in a lab where the missing gene is added			1
the genetically corrected skin is then grown to around the size of four postage stamps and grafted on to the patient ’s thigh			0
the hope is that once in place , the gene will produce lekti in the grafted skin , and increase levels of it throughout the body			2
the protein plays a key role in the creation of the tough outer surface of the skin – the stratum corneum – which acts as a barrier between the body and the outside environment			0
‘ the protein strengthens the skin , effectively putting the brakes on the shedding process , ’ dr @entity60 adds			0
‘ in @entity13 , the skin sheds , leaving a thinner and more irritable layer exposed			1
this protein stops the top layer of the skin from shedding			0
‘ we think that production and release of lekti protein from even a small patch of skin will be beneficial for the patients , leading to increased levels of the protein throughout the body			0
’ the trials , which are expected to last at least two years , will first test out the treatment on adults , and later children			1
@entity146 researchers at @entity147 , where the @entity74 gene was first identified as the cause of @entity13 15 years ago , are also involved in the trial .			2

children with @entity13 suffer from chronic skin inflammation
it affects one in every 800,000 people , with a handful of cases in the @entity32
those with it have a missing gene and trials for a treatment are under way
