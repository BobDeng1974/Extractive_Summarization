by @entity1 reporter the cities of @entity3 and @entity4 have been the backdrop for countless movies , with their iconic skylines lit up on the big screen			2
but the look that has inspired generations of directors is about to be changed for good as @entity13 street lighting is brought in			1
while the switch to led lighting means @entity4 will save at least $ 7 million in electricity bills each year , the change iconic city settings seen in films like @entity17 will be lost forever			1
the signature urban glow captured by director @entity22 has been replaced with a more clinical - looking shine after @entity4 replaced more than 140,000 street lamps with led lighting			2
@entity3 and several @entity27 cities are following suit , while in @entity30 areas of @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity33 already have some leds installed			2
director @entity22 had experimented with hd cameras during the making of the @entity50 thriller in 2004 , as he tried to capture the essence of the city at night			2
lamps made from light emitting diodes - @entity13 - are essentially filled with tiny light bulbs that , unlike traditional ones , do n't have filaments that can burn out			1
leds have a far longer life that regular bulbs , outshining them by thousands of hours			0
however , some have an incomplete color spectrum , affecting how objects bathed in the light appear			0
filmmakers already know how to compensate for changes in artificial light , but the spectrum of @entity13 will create new challenges			1
another big change is that led lamps shine white , which is great for night driving but not so useful if you are trying to shoot moody scenes like the ones in @entity17			1
by switching to @entity13 street lamps , @entity4 and @entity3 will save $ 7 million and $ 14 million a year respectively			1
he was so enamored with the way the city looked in the dark that he went to great lengths to capture it , even having a special coat of paint added to the central character 's taxi to reflect the sheens found in various parts of @entity4			0
@entity22 found the orange glow of street lamps and the @entity93 footage were the perfect combination			2
' he wanted to use the format to create a kind of glowing urban environment ; the goal was to make the @entity4 night as much of a character in the story as @entity104 and @entity105 were , ' the film 's director of photography @entity96 told @entity106			0
but the signature urban glow captured by @entity22 has been replaced with a more clinical - looking shine after @entity4 replaced more than 140,000 street lamps with led lighting			0
@entity3 is following suit , with former mayor @entity112 announcing a plan in october to replace 250,000 street lights in the city , in a move to save $ 14 million a year in running costs			1
the change means that filmmakers will need to make the change to @entity13 lighting , and begin an experimental phase of finding which ones work best			1
' every cinematographer is going to have their own taste for how something should look , and right now , there are still questions about how different brands of led lights will interact on a set , ' @entity133 , of rental company @entity134 , told @entity135			0
one of the obstacles facing lighting crews is how to make the @entity13 glow look natural			1
iconic : @entity4 at night has inspired countless directors , including @entity22 who shot @entity17 , above , there ' the interesting thing about non-tungsten artificial light sources is that they often produce a non-continuous or incomplete spectral output , ' @entity144 of @entity145 said			0
' more simply , you ca n’t really put colors back in that were n’t there to begin with , even by gelling such a light source or color correcting in post			0
' once directors have come up with the perfect light balance for @entity13 however , it is possible they will find them easier to work with			1
' whether the new look is visually preferable is a subjective matter , but you probably wo n’t find as many proponents for the old one , ' @entity144 said			0
'' especially considering that many of these led fixtures lean toward a daylight balance , they may not only offer better overall color rendition , but also better conditions under modern cool - native sensors			0
' glow : the old style street lamps helped set the tone for films such as @entity17 tense : @entity22 's thriller @entity17 , made use of several nighttime locations to add to the suspense in the film			0

white lights will change how night scenes look and how they are filmed
cities plan to save millions of *dollars* a year with switch to @entity13 lamps
