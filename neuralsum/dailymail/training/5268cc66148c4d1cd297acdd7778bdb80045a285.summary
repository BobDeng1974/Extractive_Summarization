these senior militants are believed to give orders to a group of 24 regional governors , who in turn head ' councils ' managing everything from the sale of oil , to the treatment of prisoners while terror group @entity54 's central command operates using a small highly - centralized group of trusted advisers close to leader @entity57 , @entity30 has been able to to rapidly respond to issues and developments thanks to a team of executives with the power to act on @entity23 's behalf			1
while @entity23 - whose real name is @entity67 - is the overall leader of @entity30 , he is understood to have appointed two deputies to oversee operations in @entity31 and @entity71			1

leader : while @entity8 - whose real name is @entity67 - is @entity30 ' overall chief , he is understood to have appointed two deputies to oversee operations in @entity31 and @entity71 more than 6,000 new recruits have joined @entity30 since @entity136 started targeting the terrorist group with air strikes last month , it has been claimed			1
of those radical @entity139 flocking to @entity30 ' ranks , at least 1,300 are foreigners who have arrived from outside the vast swaths of @entity71 and @entity31 currently under the group 's control , according to analysts from the @entity3 - based @entity146			1
@entity30 ' numbers have swelled in the weeks since @entity136 launched the first of 167 air strikes against the militant group on august 8			0
a number of rebel commanders who oppose @entity30 but also fight against their enemy @entity71 president @entity153 have previously warned that the strikes are increasing local support for the terrorists			0
as well as aggressive social media - led recruitment campaigns in the @entity160 , @entity30 has released a number of slick @entity163 - language propaganda videos and digital magazines			0
the releases are tailored to encourage young @entity139 living in the @entity166 to join the group			0
while the ' cabinet ' acts strictly as an advisory body for @entity23 himself , @entity30 ' leader also employs 12 ' governors ' in @entity71 and 12 governors in @entity31 who ensure his diktats are implemented			1
these 24 governors are each responsible for a specific region under @entity30 ' control , with each one appointing a team of ' councillors ' to manage every tiny aspect of everyday life in the area			2
according to @entity184 , each governor is in charge of eight councils : financial ( managing the sale of oil and the purchase of weapons and supplies ) , leadership ( implementation and drafting of laws ) , military ( defence of the territory ) , legal ( crime and punishment ) , assistance ( ensuring fighters are adequately resourced ) , security ( internal policing ) , intelligence ( information gathering ) and media ( releasing statements and propaganda , and overseeing militants ' use of social media )			0
these regional ' councils ' operate on the orders of their governor who bases his demands on those issued by @entity8 himself , and also according to new laws and advice released by another group reporting to @entity30 ' leader and deputies , namely the shura or war council			1
the group comprises a group of highly trained religious and military experts , among them @entity229 , @entity230 , @entity231 , @entity232 , and @entity233 , @entity234 , according to the @entity95			0
militants : commanding an area larger than @entity3 with a population of more than four million brutally oppressed citizens , islamic state terrorists ( pictured ) use a strict hierarchical system to manage operations @entity242 : as well as aggressive social media - led recruitment campaigns in the @entity160 , @entity30 has released a number of slick @entity163 propaganda videos ( such as the one pictured above ) and digital magazines designed to encourage young @entity139 living in @entity249 nations to join the terror group @entity30 has most likely split the ' @entity1 ' into @entity71 and @entity31 branches to make it easier to manage , @entity253 , @entity85 's @entity254 director , told @entity184			1
' they see the caliphate as one state , yet there are two different governments ...			0
i believe this split is purely administrative at this time			0
they do n't want to be seen as downplaying the caliphate , but to make it easier to govern they were forced to make a separation between @entity71 and @entity31			2
' according to @entity253 , the members of the @entity265 are particularly interesting because - although they are appointed by @entity23 - they also have the power to punish and even fire him and other senior @entity30 figures if they consider them to have breached @entity139 law			2
all major decisions on @entity30 ' activities , such as the sickening filmed murders of @entity136 journalists @entity274 and @entity276 , and @entity3 aid worker @entity277 , will also have been given approval by the @entity265 .			0
