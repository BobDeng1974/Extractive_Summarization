@entity0 and @entity1 have been cleared to host the 2018 and 2022 @entity2 after a corruption probe ruled there were no grounds for reopening the controversial bidding process			1
but there was severe embarrassment for @entity9 after the world governing body 's ethics committee launched a scathing attack over its doomed bid for the 2018 event			2
the verdict by @entity18 ethics judge @entity17 on the investigation into the murky @entity21 bids concludes that @entity1 and @entity0 did not do anything that warranted stripping them of the tournament			1
astonishingly , he reserved his strongest language for the @entity9 campaign , reprimanding its attempts to woo the support of disgraced former @entity18 committee member @entity29			2
he also criticised @entity9 for a $ 55,000 ( £ 35,000 ) sponsorship of a gala dinner , but let @entity1 off lightly for a similar $ 1.8million ( £ 1.1million ) deal			0
@entity9 2018 were reprimanded for finding a job for a friend of @entity29 , hosting a @entity50 dinner , setting up a training camp for a @entity53 under - 20 team and offering help to @entity29 's @entity56 football side			1
the 42 - page summary by the chairman of @entity18 's ethics adjudicatory chamber into 430 - page report by @entity62 lawyer @entity61 will cause considerable embarrassment to the @entity64 as well as anger			1
relationships between the @entity64 and @entity18 , already at rock bottom , will take a long time to recover from these findings			0
the @entity64 considered their bid for the 2018 @entity21 to be the most transparent of the nine countries involved and the monies spent on the breaches of bidding regulations listed by @entity17 are a fraction compared with @entity1 's spending			1
click here to read the full verdict by the @entity18 ethics judge @entity9 have been criticised for trying to woo disgraced former @entity18 vice-president @entity29 @entity81 was @entity64 chairman from 2008 - 10 and 2018 ceo @entity82 led the bidding process and while some countries , especially 2018 hosts @entity0 , were highly unco - operative with @entity61 's investigation , @entity9 look to have suffered for being so open about all their bid activity			1
an @entity64 spokesman said : ' we strongly refute any suggestions of impropriety by those involved in the @entity9 bid			1
' and conservative mp @entity95 said @entity18 's report is a whitewash , adding : ' @entity18 are trying to con people that there has been a proper independent inquiry when there has n't been '			1
as expected , @entity17 names and shames @entity29 , the biggest rogue in the @entity18 gallery who has resigned all his football positions			2
despite @entity9 's lavishing attention on him and him promising his support to prince @entity110 and pm @entity111 in person , @entity29 reneged on his vote			2
also singled out is @entity115 @entity114 , who has been banned from football for life			0
but @entity17 rules that his cash for votes bribes activity was connected with his aborted bid for the @entity18 presidency rather than the @entity1 bid			2
the @entity64 came fire for trying to woo former @entity18 vice president @entity29 ( second left , with @entity125 ) @entity29 promised prince @entity110 and prime minister @entity111 he would vote for @entity9 - then reneged the @entity64 come under fire but @entity1 cleared @entity29 appeased over @entity64 chief snub it 's in the bag ... @entity9 2018 @entity21 bid shoulders arms and hands out the @entity132 @entity9 's 2018 @entity21 traitor @entity29 has vital vote again shame on you ! now @entity18 allow @entity29 to wriggle free following corruption allegations @entity18 investigator @entity61 clasping at @entity132 bags which caused controversy during @entity9 's @entity21 2018 bid and a further blow to the @entity64 's reputation will be former @entity64 chairman @entity81 being named by @entity17 for not co-operating – due to legal reasons – with @entity61 's investigation			1
@entity1 spent $ 1.8m on sponsoring the @entity146 confederation @entity145 's @entity145 in 2010			0
@entity17 said that created a ' negative impression but the circumstances were not suited to affect the integrity of the @entity21			0
' and in conclusion about @entity1 , whose hosting of the tournament in 2022 has been mired in controversy since the december 2010 vote in @entity156 , @entity17 writes : ' the potentially problematic facts and circumstances identified by the report regarding the @entity1 bid were , all in all , not suited to compromise the integrity of the @entity21 2018/2022 bidding process as a whole			1
' the same wording is used to clear @entity9 of ' all in all , not suited to compromise the integrity of the @entity21 bidding process			0
' but nevertheless , @entity17 went into a lot more detail about @entity9 's transgressions and the ' potentially problematic conduct of certain individuals in the light of relevant @entity18 ethics rules			1
' sheik @entity173 holds the @entity21 after @entity1 win the bid to host the 2022 tournament and @entity17 passes the buck back to @entity61 's investigatory chamber to take ' appropriate steps of it deems such measures appropriate and feasible			1
' this means that @entity61 has full independence to discipline specific individuals involved in the @entity9 bid			2
@entity17 reported that the @entity9 team ' often accommodated mr @entity29 's wishes in apparent violation of bidding rules and the @entity18 code of ethics			1
' the first transgression was ' to help a person of interest to him find a part - time job in the @entity195 and not only provided the individual concerned with employment opportunities but also kept mr @entity29 apprised of their efforts as they solicited his support for the bid			0
' and @entity9 2018 gave the appearance that it sought to confer a personal benefit on mr @entity29 in order to influence his vote			0
' an artist 's impression of how the 45,330 capacity @entity210 stadium located in the north east of @entity1 will look @entity9 also provided ' substantial assistance ' to setting up a training camp for an under 20 @entity215 in the @entity195 in the summer of 2009 in response to mr @entity29 's ' improper demands			2
' @entity29 also asked for favours and benefits around his @entity53 team the @entity221 and email correspondence showed that ' @entity9 football offocials appeared willing to do so			0
' @entity17 said @entity29 repeatedly used his power in @entity18 as a vice-president on the executive committee and the @entity228 confederation overlord to exact personal benefits in violation of the @entity18 code of ethics			1
and that ' @entity9 2018 's response showed a willingness , time and again , to meet such expectation , thereby damaging the image of @entity18 and the bidding process			2
' the fourth @entity9 misdemeanour highlighted by @entity17 was sponsoring a gala dinner for the @entity50 at its annual @entity145 in @entity53 in 2010 ' once again in an effort to curry favour ' with @entity29			2
' the relevant support amounted to $ 55,000 suggested by mr @entity29			0
the @entity9 bid team bowed to that pressure because of mr @entity29 's potential vote and in this way damaged the integrity of the bidding process			1
' fans in @entity1 celebrate on the streets as their country are awarded the @entity1 back in 2010 @entity9 were also mentioned for agreeing a memorandum of understanding with the @entity254 led by president @entity255 , later banned from the @entity256 after accepting bribes in a newspaper sting , for development projects			1
@entity17 writes that that @entity9 2018 granted mr @entity255 ' considerably preferential treatment in terms of allocating football development projects			0
' @entity81 is singled out for speaking out at a @entity264 meeting under privilege about unethical conduct by four @entity256 members making improper requests for favours from the @entity9 bid team			1
but @entity81 , who resigned in may 2010 as @entity64 and @entity9 bid chairman , was criticised by @entity17 for waiting until after the vote before making is accusations and not helping the @entity61 investigation			1
and @entity17 had yet another jibe at @entity9 saying they had ' accommodated or at least attempted to satisfy the improper requests made by these @entity279 members , thereby jeopardising the integrity of the bidding process			0
' the report by @entity283 attorney @entity61 has cleared @entity1 and @entity0 to host their @entity2 other countries get off remarkably lightly for what seem far more serious breaches			0
@entity287 , one of @entity9 2018 's rivals , are hardly mentioned apart from the fact they were ' highly unco - operative			0
' and @entity0 ' made only a limited amount of documents available '			0
this was explained by the computers used during the bid having been leased			0
they were then returned to the owner and subsequently destroyed along with any email trails			0
@entity18 president @entity34 , the great survivor who set to be voted in for a fifth term next may , escapes blame and @entity17 says he , ' deserves credit for the cooperation @entity18 demonstrated throughout this investigation			0
' but @entity17 , in almost his only show of true independence , supports the term limits for the @entity18 president that the body 's congress rejected in 2014 .			0
