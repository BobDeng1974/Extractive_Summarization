life on @entity1 may have been kickstarted by a series of chemical reactions triggered by two simple but poisonous compounds that were plentiful on our planet four billion years ago			1
chemists claim they may have finally solved the riddle of how life first got going on @entity1			1
they have found it is possible to create the three main molecular building blocks of life - dna , proteins and lipids - from hydrogen cyanide , hydrogen sulphide and ultraviolet light			1
meteorite impacts , like the one in the illustration above , may have triggered the creation of hydrogen cyanide that scientists have found can create the three basic building blocks of light in reactions powered by sunlight their findings suggest that the basic components for biological cells could have all occurred simultaneously in primordial ponds and streams , coming together to form the first cells			1
this suggests that life may well have first emerged here on @entity1 - out of a toxic soup of poisonous gas - rather than being carried to our planet by a comet or meteorite from outer space			1
@entity43 stands for ribonucleic acid			2
it is one of three important molecules that are essential for all known forms of life - as well as proteins and lipids			2
@entity43 is formed from strings of nucleic acids , the same building blocks that create @entity12			2
genetic information in a cell flows from @entity12 through @entity43 to proteins			1
@entity12 is considered the ' blueprint ' of the cell and @entity43 is what helps translate it			2
some life , like viruses , only use rna and it is thought that some of the earliest organisms on @entity1 used this molecule			2
proteins are considered to be the workhorses of the cell built up from strings of amino acids			0
these carry out the biochemical reactions that take place in the cell and make life tick			0
lipids are fatty molecules that line up in formation that can create protective vesicles			0
they form the membrane ' walls ' of every living cell and give them structure			0
they are also essential for sending signals out of the cell			0
but the researchers behind the new study say that meteorite impacts probably still played a key role in giving life a first leg up on the ladder towards existence			2
they claim that meteorite impacts around four billion years ago - known as the @entity96 - could have carried with them carbon rich material that reacted with nitrogen in the air to produce an abundance of hydrogen cyanide			1
this poisonous gas could then have dissolved in water and undergone a series of chemical reactions , along with hydrogen sulphide , driven by ultraviolet light			1
professor @entity110 , a chemist at the @entity112 's @entity111 in @entity113 who led the study said : ' although it necessarily has to be painted with broad brushstrokes , the picture that emerges is of an overall reaction network developing over time in separate streams and pools , according to a dynamic flow chemistry scheme			1
' the various products would be synthesized by subtle variations in the flow - chemistry history of the streams and the order in which they merged or ran into pools			0
' although the overall scheme would not involve all the steps of the reaction network taking place simultaneously in ‘ one pot ’ , the various products would end up mixed together in pools			0
' scientists have long believed that the building blocks for life first began occurring one after another although the debate for which came first has been controversial			0
meteorite fragments and bedrock in craters like this one could have reacted with hydrogen cyanide dissolved in pools of water to create salts that react with heat and ultraviolet light to create @entity43 , lipids and amino acids the researchers behind the new paper propose a number of geochemical steps shown above that could have seen hydrogen cyanide start a series of reactions that led to the creation of amino acids , nucleic acids and lipids necessary for life			1
first the hydrogen cyanide is dissoved in water ( a ) and then reacts with metals to create salts ( b )			1
these are left behind by evaporation and then undergo changes due to geothermal heating ( c )			0
the resulting molecules are swept away by steams and accumulate in ponds where they react further ( d )			0
the researchers behind the latest study , which is published in the journal @entity176 , found they could make nucleic acids - a precursor for @entity43 and dna - from hydrogen cyanide , hydrogen sulphide and @entity181			1
they also found the same basic ingredients could also lead to the creation of amino acids , the building blocks of proteins , and lipids which form the protective membranes around biological cells			1
the conditions necessary to create all of these were found to be the same , meaning a single set of chemical reactions could have given rise to life 's basic building blocks simultaneously			1
professor @entity110 and his colleagues argue that the early @entity1 would have been a favourable setting for these reactions			1
hydrogen sulphide is thrown out in volcanic eruptions like the one above and may have been a vital ingredient in the formation of the first biological building blocks needed to create living cells , according to new research one of the great mysteries shrouding the origins of life on @entity1 is how complex organisms began to take shape			1
theory should hold that ' short ' fragments of genetic material would have reproduced in abundance , leaving longer strands - and thus complex life - behind			0
but new research has revealed that longer strands may have thrived in volcanic ' pores ' on the young @entity1 - ultimately allowing life to evolve to the complexity we see today			2
the research was carried out by a team from the @entity223 ( @entity223 ) in @entity224 and published in the journal @entity226			0
they found that water - filled micropores in hot rocks may have acted as the nurseries in which life on @entity1 began			2
one crucial precondition for the origin of life is that comparatively simple biomolecules must have had opportunities to form more complex structures			0
these , in turn , had to be capable of reproducing themselves , storing genetic information in a chemically stable form			0
creating longer strands of @entity43 to store this genetic information would have been essential - but it simply would n't have been possible in most conditions on @entity1			1
but @entity223 physicists led by dr @entity245 showed experimentally that pore systems on the seafloor that were heated by volcanic activity , namely hydrothermal vents , could have served as reaction chambers for this @entity43			2
hydrogen cyanide would have formed in large amounts due to the bombardment of comets raining down on the @entity1 a few hundred million years after it formed			1
hydrogen sulphide was also thought to be common on the early @entity1 - thrown out by volcanic eruptions - while the sun would have provided more than enough ultraviolet light			1
metal containing minerals that could have catalysed the reactions were also abundant while metal meteorites could also have caused the formation of other crucial elements like phosphate			0
in their paper , the scientists set out a series of geochemical scenarios that would have led the reactions in different directions to produce each of the necessary building blocks			0
evaporation for example could have caused salts for form that could have then been washed into streams where solar radiation would have driven further chemical reactions			0
over time the different products would have been mixed together as streams met and mingled into pools			0
@entity283 , a molecular biologist who studies the origin of life at @entity286 in @entity287 and was not involved in the study , told the journal @entity290 : ' this is a very important paper			0
' it proposes for the first time a scenario by which almost all of the essential building blocks for life could be assembled in one geological setting			0

scientists created precursors to @entity43 , proteins and lipids in basic reactions
their tests used hydrogen cyanide , hydrogen sulphide and ultraviolet light
these chemicals would have been plentiful on the @entity1 4 billion years ago
hydrogen cyanide would have been created by meteorite debris reacting with the nitrogen in the @entity1 's atmosphere during repeated space impacts
hydrogen sulphide gas was probably thrown out by erupting volcanoes
the research was conducted by chemists at the @entity112 's @entity111 in @entity113
