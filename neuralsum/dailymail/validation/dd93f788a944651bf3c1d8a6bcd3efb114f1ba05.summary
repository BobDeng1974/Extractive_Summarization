ahead of @entity2 , @entity1 's sir @entity0 rates the three contenders for the 2015 @entity5 title ... @entity6 why they can win it i ’m increasingly encouraged by their intent to attack and the willingness to keep the ball moving			1
despite missing chances against @entity18 , for the first time in a while our strike runners consistently found clean air to run in			1
@entity21 has brought confidence to this backline and it helps having two of his @entity26 team - mates starting alongside him			1
but expect a much tougher defensive line against @entity28			2
most importantly , i believe @entity6 will win because they need to			1
in @entity30 ’s fourth year in charge they are yet to win this competition			2
a number of these players have been alongside @entity36 throughout and will be just as desperate to win , most notably captain @entity33			2
this is their best chance			2
@entity26 fly half @entity21 has brought confidence to the @entity6 backline this season @entity6 and @entity42 flanker @entity41 runs with the ball during training at @entity45 on thursday @entity30 has been in charge of @entity6 for four seasons but has yet to secure a @entity5 title they have the points advantage , they are playing last and they are also the only contender playing at home			1
everyone in @entity56 by 5pm will know what is needed to win the title and it will be a great atmosphere			2
i expect @entity6 to play well			1
why they might blow it i still rate the @entity6 pack very highly , though they need a bit more pace in the back row and the recycling of possession must be quicker			1
they have n’t reached the heights of the autumn and that will frustrate @entity72			2
it ’s a concern they are finishing the tournament with less of an idea of the starting pack than when it kicked off			2
@entity79 coming in is the right call , but i am amazed there is no specialist second row on the bench			1
if there ’s an injury early on , can we expect @entity87 to play most of the game there against @entity28 ? that could cost @entity6			1
@entity6 forwards coach @entity72 oversees a ' live ' scrummaging session between his two packs there have been many examples recently where @entity6 have made the wrong decision which has cost them points and the opportunity to build a score			1
@entity30 ’s side still lack the killer instinct against top sides			2
also , @entity28 have been written off but that is completely wrong			0
@entity6 will have to be ready for a colossal physical encounter			1
who would you pay to watch ? @entity108			1
he has been a massive find and even if they take nothing else away from the championship they appear to have found an outside centre with world - class potential			1
i still believe that they need a better footballer at @entity119 — and not picking @entity120 has been a missed opportunity — but in @entity108 they have a player they can build a team around			1
it is saying something that @entity129 ’s absence has n’t been felt too much			0
i have also been hugely impressed with @entity130			0
@entity108 has been electric in his year 's tournament and has the potential to become world class @entity134 sets sights on @entity28 following @entity18 win the coach ’s strengths ? @entity6 operate more as a team of coaches , headed by @entity30 — compared with @entity141 and @entity142 where @entity143 and @entity144 are very much dominant figures			1
i always put a great amount of stock in having everyone ’s noses pointing in the same direction , but this becomes more difficult with more people involved			0
there are few coaches around who have achieved this , as @entity36 has with @entity6			1
despite some disappointments there is an air of calm about the team and belief in what they are doing			0
surrounding himself with @entity72 , @entity165 and @entity166 , he has the strongest coaching team in the northern hemisphere			0
wingers @entity169 ( left ) and @entity170 run through some evasion and footwork drills @entity142 why they can win it between @entity177 , @entity178 and @entity179 they have the best game management side			1
they also have a strong set - piece and they do the basics very well			0
this goes for their kicking game as well , with @entity188 and @entity190 ’s consistency a real nuisance			0
they are also playing @entity18 , even if the hosts do play better in @entity194			1
and if the game is dead for @entity18 with 20 minutes to go , will they mind hugely if it is the @entity197 not the @entity198 who win the tournament ? @entity142 fly half @entity177 ( centre ) gives instructions to his team - mates in @entity205 last saturday why they might blow it while i do n’t think @entity142 will be concerned heading to @entity210 , they need to score at least three tries			1
they should set themselves a target of winning by at least 21 points			0
this would leave @entity6 having to win by 15 against @entity28			1
but can they cross the whitewash enough ? who would you pay to watch ? @entity179			0
i worked with @entity179 during the 2005 @entity222 and although it was a losing tour , i am grateful to have had the opportunity to work with him			0
whatever position a youngster might play , they should look to how @entity179 conducts himself on and off the field			0
his work - rate , commitment and attitude is outstanding , but it is easy to overlook what a great player he is			0
a real giant of the game			0
@entity239 rises high to claim a lineout against the @entity241 at the @entity242 in round four the coach ’s strengths ? @entity142 have been unfairly criticised for their tactics			1
they are nowhere near as one - dimensional as they have been portrayed			0
in @entity144 they have the outstanding tactician in the competition			0
@entity144 is a pragmatist who identifies opponent ’s weak points and attacks them ruthlessly			0
if that involves kicking every other play i have no problem with that			0
@entity141 why they can win it they are hitting form at the right time and the way @entity141 have bounced back from the defeat by @entity6 has been truly impressive			1
i could see them running up a big score against @entity266			2
they have the most to do in terms of points difference , but it would be fascinating if they could do what @entity6 did last year and put 50 points on @entity266			1
wales have the potential to score five or six tries if they get going			1
tighthead prop @entity277 is a massive loss for @entity143 's side ahead of their clash against @entity266 why they might blow it they need to keep @entity266 to six points or less			2
it is the scrum which can cause them problems , taking up territory and time			2
losing prop @entity277 is a massive blow			0
who would you pay to watch ? @entity294 is the outstanding player and leader in the northern hemisphere			0
his work over the ball is exceptional and he has the pace that openside flankers need allied to incredible strength when carrying			0
take five minutes to watch @entity294 go about his work			0
what i like most is how he lifts his performance for the big games			0
he ’s a real warrior any coach would want to work with			0
@entity294 has led @entity141 superbly through the current championship with his workrate and power the coach ’s strengths ? @entity143 ’s c.v			0
is impressive and his coaches are squarely behind him — the @entity241 style is clear but incredibly difficult to stop , especially when playing an inferior team			0
beating @entity142 at their own game was brilliant to watch			2
@entity143 brings the best out of @entity319 , his defence coach , and the effort against @entity142 was world - class			1
prediction @entity142 will win by a few , @entity141 will win by a lot and @entity6 will be in a very tight game so it could come down to just one or two points			1
if i had a free bet , i ’d put it on @entity142 because if the @entity328 implode they could rack up points .			2

@entity21 has brought confidence to the @entity6 backline
@entity79 's recall to the second row is the right call
@entity108 has the potential to become a world class centre
@entity142 need to score at least three tries against @entity18 at @entity210
wales are hitting a rich vein of form at the right time
