what is it with @entity2 and @entity3 ? it ’s only four months ago that their players seemed to dominate the national team and the club had apparently provided a blueprint for potential @entity11 success			1
their rampant attacking - though ultimately fruitless - charge towards the title at the end of last season was powered by the core of @entity3 ’s @entity11 team ; @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 and , most thrillingly , most promisingly , @entity21			1
but what seemed to be a relationship with multiple mutual benefits did n’t last long			0
@entity25 retired , despite @entity26 wishing him to stay on			0
then there was @entity28 complaining bitterly that @entity3 had ignored their post-match recovery plan for @entity20 last month after the @entity31 friendly , resulting in the striker ’s injury			1
now @entity21 says he is too tired to play for his country			2
hodgson of course would deny this			0
he argued passionately on sunday night that dropping @entity21 against @entity39 was merely the most sensible option at the end of what has been a phenomenal six months for the 19 - year - old			1
' in this particular moment , it ’s a no brainer situation , ' said the @entity3 boss			2
yet , when he adds , ‘ i ’m pretty sure when he goes back to @entity2 they ’ll sort him out and come sunday ( against @entity63 ) you ’ll see him flying around , ’ it ’s difficult not to raise a @entity66 - sized quizzical eyebrow			2
what was it about the 45 minutes against @entity69 that so fatigued him ? @entity21 ( second right ) started on the bench after he complained of feeling tired during training on saturday @entity21 speaks with @entity26 on saturday night as the player inspect the pitch in @entity77 the mental strain of the game is the most widely held explanation , a suggestion at which @entity26 hinted			1
' it is n’t quite as simple as the training you ’re doing maybe taking some juice from your legs , ' he said			0
' there is an awful lot going on in your head as well			0
' yet he would surely have been wiser simply to say that he had taken the decision on @entity21 ’s behalf , rather than revealing that the player had pronounced himself tired			2
if @entity26 had taken full responsibility for the situation , which he could have easily done after the match had been won and there was no risk of being ridiculed for a left - field selection , the story would all have been much less of an issue			0
now it ’s all about how much young players want to play for @entity3 and @entity21 ’s frame of mind , a much more loaded and unpredictable news agenda			1
@entity21 has featured in 10 games for @entity2 this season and has played more than 1,000 minutes @entity21 played for @entity2 in their 2 - 1 win over @entity112 on october 4 before joining up with @entity3 add in the fact that @entity26 himself was a short - lived and unpopular manager at @entity2 – scepticism for the current @entity3 side seems most pronounced on @entity117 – then the potential for misunderstanding and conflict seems ripe			1
@entity28 ’ reaction this week will be fascinating			2
will he be grateful @entity21 had been given a break ? or annoyed that his young star has been thrust into the limelight ? certainly we know which questions are going to dominate his press briefings this week and they wo n’t be his potential tactics to take on @entity63			0
interestingly , we ’ve been here before with @entity3 and @entity2 , in 1977			1
then , one of @entity132 ’s greatest ever teams stood on verge of dominating the @entity134 and , although there was significant @entity136 , @entity137 and @entity139 contingent , within the side were a number of @entity142			0
@entity143 , who had just started as @entity3 manager , must have relished the prospect of fusing club and country			0
it never quite worked out like that			0
@entity28 looks like a re-incarnation of sir @entity46 by putting club before country in his first fixture , @entity152 picked six @entity2 players in @entity155 , @entity156 , @entity157 , @entity158 , @entity159 and @entity160			1
a seventh , @entity162 , his captain , had only just left the club to join @entity165			0
the match was a friendly against @entity168 at @entity169 and @entity3 drew 0 - 0 , hardly the most inspiring start			2
and while @entity2 went on to add to their 1977 @entity134 triumph in 1978 , 1981 and 1984 , through that period @entity3 struggled , @entity152 coming under pressure as his team only scraped into the newly - expanded 1982 @entity11 finals and then failing to reach the 1984 @entity176 under @entity177			1
@entity143 had @entity157 ( second left ) and @entity156 ( third left ) in his @entity3 side @entity18 celebrates while playing for @entity2 but looks downcast while on @entity3 duty @entity19 has emerged as a key midfielder for both @entity2 and @entity3 clearly club and country can work in tandem , as @entity186 / @entity185 and @entity188 / @entity187 have proved in recent international tournaments			2
and even if four months on from the @entity11 , it now looks like @entity191 will be providing the foundations of the @entity3 team , the national side still owes a huge debt to @entity28 ’ @entity2			1
i believe the manner in which his side took on the @entity200 last season helped sway @entity26 towards a more attacking , youthful approach			0
dr @entity202 ( left ) , the acclaimed psychiatric adviser , works with both @entity3 and @entity2 @entity20 looks frustrated playing for @entity3 during the @entity11 but celebrates at @entity2 on sunday night @entity205 was talking about the ‘ five - second fury ’ in which the @entity3 players try to press to win the ball back within the first five seconds of losing			1
it was especially evident in @entity77 and it ’s a tactic straight out of @entity211			0
the diamond with @entity21 at its tip , the full backs pushing on : all have been made fashionable by @entity28 and have the potential to turn @entity3 into a force once more			1
in @entity202 , the two managers even share a psychiatric adviser			0
perhaps he can get their inner chimps to calm down and agree on a common strategy for @entity21			0
for @entity3 have so much to gain from @entity2 and @entity21 thriving and maybe this time , unlike in the late 70s and early 80s , their energy can be harnessed to forge a successful national team .			1

@entity21 did not start for @entity3 in @entity39 after complaining of feeling tired
@entity20 was not part of squad as he continues return from injury
@entity28 is keen to put @entity2 's interests in front of @entity3 's - just as sir @entity46 did at @entity234
