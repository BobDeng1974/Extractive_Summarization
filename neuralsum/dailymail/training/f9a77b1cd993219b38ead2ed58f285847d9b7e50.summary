it was either a technical snafu or a masterful bit of diplomatic showmanship , but either way former @entity5 ambassador to the @entity7 @entity6 escaped a question monday about his nation 's reported eavesdropping on @entity7 secretary of state @entity11			1
appearing on @entity13 via live remote from @entity15 , the career diplomat spent most of his interview complaining about @entity7 's responses to @entity5 's military campaign in @entity19			1
but then @entity20 shifted gears			0
' ' @entity6 , ' she asked , ' can you still hear us ? in @entity15 ? ' ' i 'm in @entity15 , ' he answered – a response that suggests he could hear her after all			1
but then , with a hand to his earpiece , @entity6 insisted that ' i can not hear you			2
i 'm sorry , '			0
' okay , ' @entity20 said , wrapping up			0
' we 'll clarify that later			0
' according to a report published monday in the @entity54 newsweekly @entity53 , @entity5 intelligence services wiretapped @entity11 and spied on his conversations in 2013 as he was trying to piece together a peace agreement with negotiating partners in the region			1
some of his calls , according to @entity53 , ' were not made on encrypted equipment , but instead on normal telephones , with the conversations transmitted by satellite			2
' ' intelligence agencies intercepted some of those calls			0
' @entity11 's failed negotiations in 2013 added strain to an already worrisome relationship between the @entity7 and @entity5 as @entity11 and prime minister @entity70 were increasingly at odds			1
secure comms ? @entity11 spoke with @entity70 from @entity73 on july 25 , 2014 but reportedly used unencrypted lines in @entity5 last year -- making it easy for intelligence services to spy on his conversations video source @entity13 @entity78 , the @entity7 - designated terror group claiming to represent @entity80 ' interests , has lobbed hundreds of rockets into @entity5 in recent weeks , and the jewish state responded with a ground incursion into @entity19			1
@entity5 dismantled or destroyed dozens of ' terror tunnels ' in the process , reportedly crippling @entity78 ' ability to strike inside @entity5 territory			0
@entity6 , now free from the constraints of his former diplomatic station , expressed disappointment with what he said was a lack of support from the @entity7 ' i personally expect more from our allies , particularly the @entity7 , ' he told @entity20 before his audio feed went on the blink , ' to understand that we are in a desperate struggle with a terrorist group			2
' @entity78 , @entity6 said , ' is using the civilian population as a human shield [ and ] is trying to destroy this country , an ally of the @entity7 – in fact , an organization that is no different than @entity108 , no different than an @entity109 , that seeks to destroy the civilization of which @entity7 is a part			0
' @entity11 in particular has raised the hackles of government officials in @entity5 because of his efforts at mediation , with hostile media reports there claiming he and the @entity7 have tried to negotiate a peace agreement that favors @entity78 .			2

@entity6 may have *feigned* technical *difficulties* in order to escape a tough interview question
asked ' can you still hear us in @entity15 ? ' he answered , ' i 'm in @entity15 , ' before claiming his audio feed was dead
the @entity54 newsweekly @entity53 reported monday that @entity5 intelligence services eavesdropped on secretary of state @entity11 's phone calls last year as he tried to *broker* a @entity134 peace deal
