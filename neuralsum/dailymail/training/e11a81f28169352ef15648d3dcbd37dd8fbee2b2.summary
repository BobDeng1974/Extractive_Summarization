by @entity0 published : 22:52 est , 26 september 2013 updated : 02:17 est , 27 september 2013 it looked like prince @entity3 's hands were wandering as he chatted with a top charity official last night			1
the royal was at an event to promote @entity7 , which helps co-ordinate relief efforts in disaster areas as he watched a team responding to a mock earthquake he praised the ' extraordinary ' volunteers of a humanitarian emergency response organisation as he was spirited to the heart of a devastating earthquake			1
but it appeared he was making a slightly suspicious gesture as he chatted to the organisation 's chief executive @entity18			1
the royal looked on intently as a small team of three @entity7 volunteers battled to cope with the natural disaster inside a canvas field tent complete with satellite phones , first aid kits and dozens of maps			2
@entity7 , which is based near @entity40 , @entity41 , produces maps highlighting not only the geography of an area but where need is greatest and the locations for vital humanitarian aid			0
the organisation has successfully deployed to more than 40 emergency missions since its service was launched over 10 years , helping millions of people affected by disaster			0
speaking to potential @entity7 donors and existing financial supporters and helpers at the @entity24 in @entity56 said he had met volunteers			2
patron : prince @entity3 , centre , with chief executive , @entity18 , right , and chairman of trustees , @entity62 , at a reception for @entity7 at the @entity24 , in central @entity25 he said : ' i was struck by their willingness to drop everything at a moment 's notice - despite the fact i 'd do that in my job anytime - and step into the heart of the crisis no matter where it is in the world , leaving loved ones behind			1
' he added : ' and to do this knowing that very few people will have any idea what contribution they have made			0
they are extraordinary people and this is an extraordinary organisation			1
' the mock earthquake was based on the organisation 's efforts in @entity88 whose capital @entity91 was devastated by a natural disaster in 2010			0
proud : prince @entity3 has praised the ' extraordinary ' volunteers of a humanitarian emergency response organisation during the scenario @entity95 , a glaciologist with the @entity96 who was part of the @entity7 team sent to @entity88 , told the audience : ' we 've got some text messages from people trapped in the rubble , we 're putting the locations into the maps and sending out teams			1
' this was based on real events from @entity91 as texts were used to track down survivors			0
@entity7 has been working in @entity112 since december to map the needs of affected communities and co-ordinate humanitarian efforts to ensure those most in need receive help @entity117 last week two members of its team flew to the @entity121 where weeks of heavy rains triggered flash floods in august			2
the @entity124 called @entity7 ' @entity126 people and this is an extraordinary organisation ' dozens of people were killed and hundreds of thousands have been affected by the disaster which hit the area around the capital @entity134			1
@entity3 told his audience : ' the maxim ' who , what , why , when and where ' is common to many organisations and across many different situations for a very reason			0
' without this information it 's just not possible to make effective decisions			0
in the context of a natural disaster it is of course vital to make decisions quickly in order to save lives and protect those who may still be in danger			0
' @entity7 's ability to have experts on the ground within hours , collating this information in support of decision makers , has placed them at the very heart of international response efforts over the last 10 to 11 years			2

@entity124 made poor *choice* of hand gestures as he chatted to chief executive
@entity3 is patron of @entity7 , which helps in relief efforts during disasters
he praised volunteers who map areas struck by catastrophe
' they are extraordinary people and this is an extraordinary organisation '
