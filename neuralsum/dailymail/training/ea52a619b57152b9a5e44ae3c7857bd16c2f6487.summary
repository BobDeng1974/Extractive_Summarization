by @entity0 published : 16:23 est , 16 september 2013 updated : 09:54 est , 17 september 2013 a human foot still wearing its athletic shoe washed onto a @entity4 beach sunday morning			2
a black size 11.5 @entity7 sneaker contained the extremely decayed remains and no signs of the rest of the body were found			1
@entity13 personnel found the foot after a beachgoer called to report the gruesome sighting			1
no sign of the rest of the body was found ' what we have is a human foot , with some associated tissue , inside of a shoe , ' @entity26 , an investigator with the city 's @entity27 , told the @entity30			1
the find at the city 's @entity32 , while gory , is not all that uncommon			0
according to @entity35 , at least 13 or 14 such feet were found in the @entity36 between 2007 and 2012			1
one theory about the origin of the feet -- and their lack of a body -- is that the shoe somehow protects the foot from being eaten or fully decomposing			1
long gone : the gruesome discovery was made at @entity32 in @entity4			0
experts say the foot was likely rolling around on the ocean floor for a long time as the body decays , the foot may detach and float away , eventually washing onto shore			2
this can even happen many years after death			0
two feet that came ashore in 2011 were traced to a suicide in @entity54 from seven years prior			0
@entity26 suggested something similar in the case of the @entity4 foot			0
' it probably was rolling around the seabed for awhile , ' he said .			0

the @entity7 was a size 11.5
