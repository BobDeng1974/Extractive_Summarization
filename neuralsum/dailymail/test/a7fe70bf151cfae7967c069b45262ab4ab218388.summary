yet the visitors ' performance at @entity16 on saturday has given @entity0 and @entity18 cause for optimism			1
@entity5 ace @entity0 was happy with his side 's display at @entity16 despite the negative result @entity1 labelled his side 's performance against rivals @entity7 as their best display of the season ' i thought it was excellent , we dominated from start to finish , ' @entity0 told @entity33			1
' we created some good chances , but unfortunately did n't take any of them			2
' i felt that if we got a goal , even with five minutes to go , we would have gone on to win			0
' we can take great confidence from this result as i 've rarely seen a team come to @entity16 and dominate so much , all that was missing was a goal			1
' on another day we could have scored two or three goals , but it was n't to be			2
' we have to move on now and look forward to facing @entity44 next weekend			0

' that is an unbelievable performance , i think			0
but you need to score			0
' normally we are more effective			0
i think we played a fantastic match , but we lost			2
' @entity63 , pictured with @entity7 team - mate @entity64 , scored the only goal of the game @entity18 was forced into deploying @entity0 in midfield due to the absence of @entity47 and @entity69			1
