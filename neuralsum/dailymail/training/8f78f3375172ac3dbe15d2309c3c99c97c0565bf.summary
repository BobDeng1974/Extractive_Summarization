the @entity1 ’s highly secret unmanned space plane was supposed to stay in space for nine months , but it ’s now been there for a year and three days – and no one knows what it ’s doing			2
the experimental craft has been circling @entity9 at 17,000 miles per hour and was due to land in @entity11 in december			1
however the mission of the @entity14 orbital test vehicle was extended – for unknown reasons			1
mystery tour : the mission of the @entity14 space plane was extended after it spent nine months orbiting the @entity9 the plane resembles a mini space shuttle and is the second to fly in space			1
the first one landed last december at @entity24 in @entity11 after more than seven months in orbit			1
the 29 - foot , solar - powered craft had an original mission of 270 days			0
the @entity1 said the second mission was to further test the technology but the ultimate purpose has largely remained a mystery			0
the vehicle 's systems program director , lieutenant - colonel @entity32 , told the @entity34 in december : ' we initially planned for a nine - month mission			2
keeping the @entity14 in orbit will provide us with additional experimentation opportunities and allow us to extract the maximum value out of the mission			1
' questions : the unmanned space plane is the second of its kind to be sent up by the @entity1 - but its purpose has never fully been explained finishing touches : scientists in protective suits inspect the solar - powered craft prior to its mission however , many sceptics think that the vehicle 's mission is defence or spy - related			0
there are rumours circulating that the craft has been kept in space to spy on the new @entity61 space station , @entity62			0
however , analysts have pointed out that surveillance would be tricky , since the spacecraft would rush past each other at thousands of metres per second			0
preparing for lift off : the @entity1 said the craft is being used to test space technology but there have been suggestions it is being used to spy keeping watch : an artist 's rendition of the @entity14 shuttle orbiting the @entity9 and @entity77 , from the @entity78 , pointed out to the @entity79 : ‘ if the @entity80 really wanted to observe @entity62 , it has enough assets to do that without using @entity14			1
’ last may , amateur astronomers were able to detect the orbital pattern of the first @entity14 which included flyovers of @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 and @entity90 , heightening the suspicion that the vehicle was being used for surveillance			1
other industry analysts have speculated that the @entity1 is just making use of the @entity14 ’s amazing fuel efficiency and keeping it in space for as long as possible to show off its credentials and protect it from budget cuts			1
@entity101 this undated image released by the @entity1 shows the @entity14 spacecraft			1
its mission and cost are shrouded in secrecy lift off : the @entity14 sits on top of an @entity110 rocket as it 's launched at @entity111 in @entity112 in 2010 ready for launch : the @entity14 rocket in @entity112 before it blasted off into space mystery : scientists work on a prototype for the rocket prior to its launch after all , under budget cuts for 2013 to 2017 proposed by the @entity125 administration , the office that developed the @entity14 will be shut down			2
according to @entity14 manufacturer @entity127 , the space plane operates in low - earth orbit , between 110 and 500 miles above earth			2
by comparison , the @entity130 orbits at about 220 miles			0
the current flight launched from @entity111 , @entity112 , in march			0
@entity101 this computer image shows the space plane re-entering @entity9			2
although it resembles a small space shuttle it is not designed to carry humans			0
it 's wingspan is a mere 4.5m with a length of 8.9m			0
it is powered by batteries and solar cells			0

the @entity14 has been circling the @entity9 at 17,000mph and was due to land in @entity11 in december
