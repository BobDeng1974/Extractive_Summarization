but mr @entity8 , who lives in his property with wife @entity24 , 34 , and children @entity25 , 15 , @entity27 , six , and @entity19 , three , says far from being a nuisance it is he who is being hounded out by fellow residents			1
he claims that since moving into the property 15 months ago his neighbours have shunned him , complained about the noise his children make and wrongly blamed him for dog mess and litter on the grass surrounding the flats			1
mr @entity8 says since the complaints he has become increasingly stressed when his youngsters play indoors , has thrown out his stereo , sold his dog and makes his teenage daughter listen to music using headphones			1
he admits listening to music loudly on three occasions - two of which were his wife and teenage daughter ’s birthdays			1
he said : ' i am meant to be living in freedom but it feels like sometimes we are in a prison			2
' i ca n’t listen to music , i ca n’t let my kids play inside , i ca n’t have a dog , i ca n’t decorate my house			1
' i feel stressed all the time			0
i think i have to think about changing my house but like the area i live			0
' i feel like they want me and my family on the streets			0
' write caption here mr @entity8 says problems started as soon as he moved in to the property			1
he said : ' almost straight away i was being asked why i was moving into a flat instead of a house			0
' i was saying hello to people and they were just ignoring me			0
i felt like i looked like a monster or something			0
' then they would complain about my kids making noise playing			0
one time my wife came to the door carrying one child and the shopping and they deliberately shut it			0
' then a fox tears open bin bags and drags it across the grass and i am blamed for the mess , then a dog fouls in the garden and it has to be my dog			1
' i do n’t understand it			0
we are not bad people , i am not a terrorist or a bandit			0
' but i listen to music three times and get a bill for £ 1,300			2
' mr @entity8 said he could never afford to pay the charges as only his wife currently works and he had to return to @entity100 to sort out his father ’s funeral			1
a spokeswoman for @entity10 said that after several warnings they served a notice under section 80 of the @entity109 abatement notices			0
despite this the complaints continued and officers witnessed two breeches of the abatement notice			0
@entity115 , environmental health officer , said : ' we warned mr @entity8 that he was in breach of the noise abatement notice and if he did again it would lead to court action			2

cllr @entity127 , @entity128 said : ' fines are always the last resort but local residents have the right to live without unreasonable noise from their neighbours			2
