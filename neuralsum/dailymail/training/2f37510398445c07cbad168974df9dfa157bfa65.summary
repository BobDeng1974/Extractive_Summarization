by @entity0 the man booker prize longlist was revealed today with @entity3 authors in the running for one of literature 's top honours for the first time			1
@entity9 , @entity10 and past winner @entity11 are all among the authors vying for the prestigious award , as its new global embrace gives fewer than half the places to @entity18 writers			1
a rule change has now opened the award to more international writers , enabling @entity3 to be included for the first time with four @entity3 authors among the list of 13 announced			1
in the running : @entity9 ( left ) and @entity10 ( right ) are among the authors vying for the prestigious @entity27 , as its new global embrace gives fewer than half the places to @entity18 writers the remaining places go to @entity32 @entity31 and two @entity34 writers @entity35 - who lives in @entity36 - and @entity37			1
they would have been eligible under the previous rules which allowed authors from the @entity41 and the @entity34			1
organisers of the @entity18 ’s best - known fiction award - worth £ 50,000 to the winner - announced last year they were opening up the 46 - year - old prize to writers of any nationality writing in @entity48			1
among the @entity49 in contention is @entity51 whose debut novel @entity53 , written in his own made - up language based on @entity48 - was published by independent publisher unbound after being financed through online crowdfunding			2
past winner : @entity11 , who won the @entity27 in 2010 for his novel @entity58 , has made the longlist again with his new work j the list features celebrated writer @entity10 , whose novels one day and starter for 10 were adapted into movie hits , with his latest work @entity3 earning him a place			1
@entity9 - in the running for his book @entity68 - and @entity69 - represented by her novel how to be both - have each made the shortlist on two previous occasions			2
@entity11 , who won the @entity27 in 2010 for @entity58 , has made the 2014 longlist for his book @entity77 the other @entity18 writer to be included by the six - strong judging panel , chaired by @entity80 , is @entity82 - born @entity81 for @entity83			2
@entity84 ( @entity3 ) - to rise again at a @entity85 @entity31 ( @entity32 ) - @entity86 @entity87 ( @entity3 ) - we are all completely beside ourselves @entity11 ( @entity18 ) - j @entity51 ( @entity18 ) - the @entity53 @entity9 ( @entity18 ) - the @entity68 @entity81 ( @entity18 ) - the lives of others @entity10 ( @entity18 ) - @entity3 @entity35 ( @entity34 ) - @entity92 @entity93 ( @entity3 ) - orfeo @entity69 ( @entity18 ) - how to be both @entity37 ( @entity34 ) - history of the rain but it is the inclusion of @entity3 writers for the first time which will fuel much of the discussion about this year ’s list			1
the tipped @entity102 book @entity101 failed to make it , but to rise again at a @entity85 author @entity84 , @entity87 who wrote we are all @entity107 , @entity109 's @entity108 and @entity110 by @entity93 have all made the list			0
' this is a diverse list of ambition , experiment , humour and artistry , ' mr @entity80 said of the nominees			0
' the novels selected are full of wonderful stories and fascinating characters			0
' the judges were impressed by the high quality of writing and the range of issues tackled - from 1066 to the future , from a pow camp in @entity128 , to a dentist ’s chair in @entity131 , from the funny to the deeply serious , sometimes in the same book			0
' the announcement last year that the @entity27 was dropping its geographical borders came in the wake of the launch of the @entity137 - seen by many as a rival award - which attracted an international field			0
there were also changes to the number of books which publishers could enter			0
@entity145 , who chairs the @entity146 , said : ' our new model , in recognising literary achievement , should encourage the traditional publishing houses while ensuring novels from new green - shoot publishers continue to be included			0
popular : the list features celebrated writer @entity10 , whose novel one day was adapted into a film starring @entity156 ( pictured ) , with his latest work @entity3 earning him a place ' by including writers from around the world to compete alongside @entity41 and @entity34 writers , the @entity27 is reinforcing its standing as the most important literary award in the @entity48 - speaking world			1
' @entity165 - who won the prize in 1981 for @entity167 - said of the expansion of entry : ' i think it ’s a really great thing that finally we ’ve got an english - language prize that does n’t make a distinction for writers who are writing from a particular country			0
' last year ’s prize was won by @entity179 @entity178 , who became the youngest victor at the age of 28 and her book @entity183 , at 832 pages , was also the longest winner			0
missing out : @entity102 's hotly tipped @entity101 failed to make the prize 's longlist @entity189 , a former deputy editor of @entity191 , has previously written non-fiction books which have included an examination of the negative impact of globalisation as well as poetry			2
he has said of @entity53 : ' i constructed , almost by accident , my own language : a middle ground between the @entity48 that would have been spoken by these characters and the @entity48 we speak today			2
' the result is a book which is written in a tongue that no - one has ever spoken , but which is intended to project a ghost image of the speech patterns of a long - dead land : a place at once alien and familiar			0
' bookmaker @entity212 makes @entity35 the favourite to take the prize at 4/1 , while @entity9 is the top @entity18 hope at 5/1 second favourite			2
it puts @entity31 at 6/1 , @entity69 7/1 , @entity11 and @entity93 at 8/1 , @entity87 and @entity37 on 9/1 , while @entity81 and @entity10 are 10/1 and @entity84 , @entity109 and @entity189 are at 20/1			1
' after all the fears about a @entity3 - dominated list , the number of @entity18 writers comes as a surprise , although the absence of any authors from @entity226 or @entity227 is perhaps the more striking aspect of the spread of nationalities , ' said @entity231 , of @entity233 bookshops			1
' the omissions of @entity102 ’s @entity101 and @entity236 ’s @entity235 are indications of what an outstanding year for fiction 2014 is turning out to be			0
' i doubt anyone would have predicted the appearance of @entity87 or @entity10 , but their books are by no means the only longlisted ones with the potential to appeal to very broad readership			2
' he added : ' with more well - known than most years , sales should be very strong			0
@entity9 will probably be the favourite , and he ’d make a very deserving winner - but @entity31 is probably the dark - horse bet			0
' to rise again at a @entity85 ( left ) by @entity84 from the @entity3 and @entity86 by @entity31 , from @entity32 we are all @entity254 ( left ) by @entity87 of the @entity3 and @entity255 ( right ) by the @entity18 author @entity11 the @entity53 ( left ) by @entity51 of @entity18 and @entity68 ( right ) by another @entity18 author , @entity9 @entity83 ( left ) by @entity81 of @entity18 and @entity3 ( right ) by @entity18 author @entity10 @entity110 ( left ) by @entity3 author @entity93 and @entity92 ( right ) by @entity34 's @entity35 how to be both ( left ) by @entity18 author @entity69 and @entity258 ( right ) by @entity34 author @entity37			1
