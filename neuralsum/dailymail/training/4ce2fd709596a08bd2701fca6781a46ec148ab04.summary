caked in dust and wading through recycled plastic , these are just some of the thousands of children who work illegally in @entity5			1
more than a million children are involved in dangerous work in the country - despite the minimum working age being 14 , according to the @entity11			1
these compelling photographs were taken in the capital , @entity14 , a city where one year ago a garment factory collapsed killing more than 1,100 people			1
stolen youth : a @entity5 child laborer works with his mother as they sift through empty bottles at a recycling center in @entity14			1
the minimum working age is 14 playground : like in a ball pit in @entity29 countries , a toddler looks at home atop empty bottles at the recycling plant while parents and siblings sift through the waste youth : at 10 years old , @entity37 ( pictured ) is too young to be working at this balloon factory in @entity14 but is like many youngsters employed in small workshops @entity41 : the balloon factory is not the most hazardous line of work			1
some children work in farming , spreading dangerous chemicals without adequate protection they show children working with their parents in a recycling plant and a balloon factory - hunched over moulds , spraying coloured paint and filling bags with plastic bottles			1
despite a wave of new support for factory unions in the wake of the collapse of the eight - storey @entity63 last april , which killed 1,135 on the outskirts of @entity14 , many people still work in dangerous conditions			1
in the ready - made garment sector alone , some $ 24million has been put towards new safety measures by the @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity72			0
there are already 392 more government inspectors than this time last year			0
but many child labourers in the country slip under the radar , according to observers			1
one group , the @entity11 , says at least 7.4million children aged 5 to 17 are involved in economic activities			0
of those , 1.3million are involved in hazardous work			0
the minimum employment age is 14 , but 93 per cent of child labourers work in small factories and workshops which allow their employers - or parents - to slip them under a radar , according to @entity93			1
hard at work : a 12 - year - old boy in the balloon factory			2
some 1.3million children aged five to 17 do hazardous work , according to the @entity11 cottage industry : old and young workers exist side - by - side , often in improvised conditions			2
the minimum wage is around $ 66 a month , but children earn less family : @entity5 boys and a woman working in a balloon factory at @entity108 , @entity14			1
the city was home to the @entity112 building , which collapsed killing 1,100 injuries : with constant heavy lifting and bending down , many children suffer repetitive strain injuries or back pains before they have reached adulthood poverty often forces families to send children to work in jobs like brick - chipping , construction and waste - picking			1
even though the minimum wage is around $ 66 a month children are paid less than adults , with many working up to twelve hours a day - often preventing them from attending school			2
in @entity14 alone , an informal survey found 4,000 children working in more than 1,000 types of dangerous workshops or factories			1
a @entity93 statement said : ' long hours , low or no wages , poor food , isolation and hazards in the working environment can severely affect children â€™s physical and mental health			0
' child labourers are also vulnerable to other abuses such as racial discrimination , mistreatment and sexual abuse			2
' some work , such as domestic labour , is commonly regarded as an acceptable employment option for children , even though it too poses considerable risks			0
' some children work on farms , where they use dangerous tools , carry heavy loads and spread harmful chemical pesticides			2
@entity161 : @entity162 , a nine - year - old @entity5 boy , works in a balloon factory at @entity108 , @entity14			1
some children drop out of school and work long hours instead paint : a boy dyes balloons on different sets of moulds in the factory			2
such small industries can be vastly different from the huge garment factories making headlines the world outside : light can be seen streaming in through gaps in the brickwork of the workshop as a young worker dips balloons in pink and purple paint in a country with little medical care , they can end up with back injuries , infections and repetitive strain injuries before they have reached adulthood			2
many girls , meanwhile , work long hours as domestic servants and are subject to discrimination , harassment and sexual abuse , according to the @entity70 government			0
most of the dead were adults last april when the @entity112 building crumbled to the ground , in what became the deadliest accidental building collapse in modern history			0
last week , as relatives of the dead gathered in their memory , @entity206 revealed she was just 13 when she was rescued from the building			0
surrounded by dead colleagues , she survived trapped in an air pocket between blocks of collapsed concrete			0
sibling love : this young boy beamed a broad smile despite having to help sift through the bottles left at one of @entity14 's recycling plants @entity93 said : ' some work , such as domestic labour , is regarded as an acceptable employment option for children , even though it too poses considerable risks ' all ages : long hours , low wages and harsh working conditions are not limited to children			1
adults often face the same hardship in order to make a living for themselves the owner of the illegally constructed @entity112 building is behind bars , pending an investigation , but there has been no word on when he will be put on trial			0
the owners of the five factories operating inside the building also have been detained			0
observers claim the international companies which used clothes made in @entity112 are not contributing enough to the trust fund for survivors and victims ' families			0
@entity253 , deputy @entity254 director at @entity256 , said : ' one year after @entity112 collapsed , far too many victims and their families are at serious risk of destitution			0
