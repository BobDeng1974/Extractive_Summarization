by @entity0 follow @ @ laura_mail amid the fanfare that always accompanies the arrival of mr @entity4 on to an athletics track , it was easy to overlook the fact that the @entity7 and his band of merry men were not , for once , the quickest in the men ’s 4x100 metre relay heats			1
they won their heat ahead of @entity15 with @entity4 on the anchor leg , but that honour fell to @entity18 , who managed to get the baton round a full 21 hundredths of a second quicker than @entity7			1
@entity18 ’s time of 38.78sec will mean little when it comes to today ’s final , of course , but then @entity4 ’s long overdue appearance at @entity24 has always felt more about significance than substance			1
he came , cavorted and the crowd loved him for it			2
that was the main thing			0
@entity18 , though , will bring in 100m silver medallist @entity58 and 200m finalist @entity59 to try and test how fit the world ’s fastest man really is after his foot injury in april			0
‘ we told each other “ just get it round ” , ’ said @entity4			2
it was wonderful — just like the @entity66			0
’ there ’s no need to push it , @entity4 , but it was a wonderful night of athletics inside a sold - out , bouncing @entity24 , with @entity18 winning a gold , three more silver medals and a bronze			1
@entity73 won the pole vault , completing the full set of @entity34 medals after a bronze in @entity78 in 2006 and a silver four years ago in @entity80			0
the 27 - year - old , who has been sharing a room with fellow @entity34 champion @entity83 , beat compatriot @entity84 , 26 , in a jump - off after both men had cleared 5.55m without recording a single failure			2
for @entity73 , victory was the perfect response to losing his @entity91 funding last autumn after failing to record a height in qualifying at august ’s @entity94			0
he said : ‘ 2013 was a really hard year , so i hope i ’m back on track and that this is my springboard on the way to @entity98 ( and the 2016 @entity99 )			1
it ’s given me my confidence back			0
’ @entity102 : @entity4 was up to his usual antics before and after the race , entertaining the crowd and the tv cameras relay : @entity7 ( right ) , @entity15 ( centre ) and @entity109 ( left ) went into the home straight fairly even @entity111 won silver behind @entity99 champion @entity113 in the 100m hurdles , with the @entity109 showing unusual emotion as she embarked on her victory lap. @entity117 , 26 , has suffered with injury and was also labelled ‘ a bad example to the entire national team ’ by head coach @entity119 in the build - up to the successful defence of her @entity34 title			1
there was also a tear - jerking 800m silver for @entity128 ’s @entity127 , whose father @entity129 won five @entity34 medals , after a torrid year			2
only four months ago she was in hospital , wired to an intravenous drip and on antibiotics after suffering an infection , wondering how on earth she would be able to qualify for , let alone compete in , @entity136			1
she was forced to miss last year ’s @entity94 with a leg tendon injury , had two operations in september and october and spent so much time rehabilitating on a bike that she seriously considered switching sports to cycling			2
even a couple of weeks ago in @entity145 , when she broke the two - minute barrier for the first time , she showed off the large plaster on her foot that protects a very raw wound when she runs			2
@entity127 scraped through to the final as a fastest loser and then was on a drip again on friday morning after ‘ throwing up all night ’			0
acknowledgement : @entity4 claps to the crowd after helping @entity7 ease into the 4x100m final on friday yet , with the words ‘ get out strong , commit ’ inked on her right hand , she found the energy to chase champion @entity157 of @entity158 down the home straight			1
@entity18 ’s @entity162 , 19 , and @entity163 finished fourth and sixth			0
@entity127 said : ‘ this is my everything			0
this year has been obstacle after obstacle and there was no way i was going to go through everything i have and not get a medal			0
part - time model @entity171 , 21 , cleared a new personal best of 1.92m to win silver in the high jump behind 18 - year - old world youth champion @entity176 of @entity109			1
there was also success in the field for @entity180 , who won a bronze medal in the discus by throwing a season ’s best of 60.48m			0
competing at @entity24 was a far cry from the 27 - year - old ’s usual training environment : a farmer ’s field in @entity190 in which her father , @entity191 , built a concrete , @entity99 - sized throwing circle			1
@entity194 , another @entity7 2013 triple sprint gold medallist , made her first appearance of the @entity34 to anchor @entity7 to victory in their women ’s 4x100m relay heat			1
@entity18 opted to rest 200m medallists @entity201 and @entity203 , but still qualified for today ’s final in second place			0
@entity18 ’s men ’s and women ’s 4x400m teams progressed comfortably as well			0
@entity209 : @entity4 had been at the centre of controversy all week but lived up to the expectations relaxed : @entity4 has his hand on in his head while he stands on the track in his training clothes before the race calm : @entity4 looked relaxed and eased with his @entity7 team - mates around the track to record a fast time			1

@entity4 arrived in @entity136 six days before his first appearance on friday
he ran the anchor leg for @entity7 in the heats of the 4x100m relay
@entity4 took the baton and eased to qualify from their heat in 38.99 seconds
six - time @entity99 champion *roared* down the track by @entity24 crowd
@entity4 took to @entity236 earlier in the week to deny a *report* in @entity238
