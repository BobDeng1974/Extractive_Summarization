by @entity0 hopes of a @entity3 style resurrection of dinosaurs may have to stay in the ‘ realms of fiction ’ , according to a study			2
the chance of bringing to life a @entity10 or a @entity11 by extracting dna from insects in amber , as depicted in the 1993 film , have been described as ‘ highly unlikely ’ , according a study published in @entity17			2
in the @entity20 movie , scientists extract dino dna from ancient mosquitos trapped in 130 - million year old amber			1
in the @entity20 movie , scientists extract dino dna from ancient mosquitos trapped in 130 - million year old amber			1
the year before the film was released , scientists in @entity26 claimed to have extracted fragments of @entity12 from an extinct species of bee the year before the film was released , scientists in @entity26 claimed to have extracted fragments of dna from an extinct species of bee			1
but a study by the the @entity33 , @entity34 , found it was impossible to replicate			0
using highly - sensitive ‘ next generation ’ sequencing dna techniques on insects in copal , the sub-fossilised resin precursor of amber , researchers found the 1990 ’s studies provided ‘ false positives ’ mistaken for genuine ancient dna			1
in fact they could find not detect ancient dna in relatively young - 60 years to 10,600 years old - sub-fossilised insects and said the earlier results are thought to come from cross contamination between modern and ancient dna			0
using highly - sensitive next generation sequencing dna techniques on insects in copal , the sub-fossilised resin precursor of amber , researchers found the 1990 's studies provided ' false positives ' mistaken for genuine ancient dna researchers said the results raise significant doubts about claims of dna extraction from fossil insects in amber study co author professor @entity61 , who carried out the study in full forensic suits in the ancient dna lab at the @entity65 , said : ' in the original 1990s studies dna amplification was achieved by a process called the polymerase chain reaction ( @entity70 ) , which will preferentially amplify any modern , undamaged dna molecules that contaminate an extract of partially degraded ancient ones to give false positive results that might be mistaken for genuine ancient dna			1
' our approach , using " next generation " sequencing methods is ideal for ancient dna because it provides sequences for all the dna molecules in an extract , regardless of their length , and is less likely to give preference to contaminating modern molecules			0
' researchers said the results raise significant doubts about claims of dna extraction from fossil insects in amber			0
co author dr @entity89 , also from @entity65 , said : ' intuitively , one might imagine that the complete and rapid engulfment in resin , resulting in almost instantaneous demise , might promote the preservation of @entity12 in a resin entombed insect , but this appears not to be the case			0
' so , unfortunately , the @entity3 scenario must remain in the realms of fiction			0

in the film , scientists extract dna from ancient mosquitos trapped in amber
researchers had *previously* claimed to have taken @entity12 from an extinct bee
scientists said these studies , done in the 1990s , provided ‘ false positives ’
