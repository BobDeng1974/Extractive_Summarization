an alarming number of young women are misinformed when it comes to contraception , according to new research			0
@entity5 have released results from a survey of 1,500 @entity9 women aged 25 - 34 that reveals a number of myths continue to exist around family planning			1
the survey suggests that better communication may be needed during @entity16 consultations to help women understand the variety of contraceptive options available , with only 58 percent of women saying their doctor had explored all options with them			1
oh , baby : many young women are risking unwanted pregnancies due to a lack of awareness on contraception many of the women were risking an unwanted pregnancy as one in 10 believed it 's impossible to get pregnant during their period			1
meanwhile if condoms were n't available , a quarter had heard of faith being put in ' alternative ' barrier methods such as cling film , latex gloves or even a plastic sandwich bags			1
meanwhile , 17 per cent of women had relied on the withdrawal method in the past			1
as a result of using no or insufficient protection , 30 per cent had needed to take the morning after pill			1
despite recent scares over the increased risk of blood clots when taking some contraceptive pills , the @entity47 remained the most popular method of contraception , as four out of five of the women surveyed had taken it at some point and nearly half ( 48 per cent ) said it is their most regular form of contraception			1
but results indicated that some may be selecting the @entity47 as a ' default ' option due to low awareness of alternative methods			1
nearly a third of women had never heard of the hormonal implant , 27 per cent had not heard of the contraceptive injection and more than a third were unfamiliar with the intrauterine system ( @entity72 or ' hormonal coil ' ) and the intrauterine device ( @entity75 or ' copper coil ' )			0
unsafe sex : an alarming number of women had heard of household goods like sandwich bags being used when condoms were n't available default option : many women are using the pill because they do n't know enough about alternatives just under half of women did not realise that intrauterine methods are placed in the womb and can be removed at any time			2
of the 15 per cent who had considered using an intrauterine method but decided against it , nearly one in five had done so due to a lack of information			1
dr @entity97 , consultant in community gynaecology and reproductive healthcare at @entity100 , said : ' the healthcare professional has an important role to play in ensuring that all contraceptive options are discussed with women , including @entity106 - acting @entity105 ( @entity107 ) , which offer convenience and reliability as women do not need to think about taking them every day			0
' many women might be surprised to hear that @entity107 are more effective in practice than user - dependent methods such as the @entity47 and have a number of additional lifestyle benefits			2
' despite many women expressing clear preferences for the qualities associated with @entity107 , use of these methods is low and women could be selecting the @entity47 merely as a default option			2
' you ca n't get pregnant while on your period the withdrawal method is a fool proof method of contraception you ca n't get pregnant if you have sex standing up contraception â€¦ that 's basically just the @entity47 household items make great barrier methods @entity133 is an effective spermicide long acting reversible contraceptives ca n't be removed with awareness of @entity107 methods so low , it 's unsurprising that only 36 percent of women surveyed had ever tried a @entity107 method and less than 1 in 10 had tried an intrauterine method			1
this is despite expressing clear preferences for features associated with @entity107 methods : 77 percent of women said they would like a method they did not need to think about regularly and 67 percent would prefer a contraceptive to last several years			2
additional knowledge gaps and misconceptions identified in the survey concerned the use of certain @entity107 methods in specific groups of women			0
for example , nearly half of women did not know whether an @entity75 , an @entity72 or an implant can be used in younger women or whether it can be used in women who have not had children			0
some were also unclear about when fertility would return and many thought that it would take several months			0
however , fertility returns to the women 's usual level within a matter of weeks with all these methods			0
@entity171 , director of health and wellbeing at sexual health charity @entity174 , said : ' this research highlights some important knowledge gaps and misconceptions that continue to exist around contraception			0
' at @entity174 , our aim is to encourage positive conversations between women and healthcare professionals to ensure that all methods are communicated and any myths are accurately dispelled			0
greater awareness of all the available options , including @entity107 , could not only help to reduce rates of unintended pregnancy , but also help women in search of a contraceptive that could suit their needs more than the method they may be using			2
' the @entity174 have information on all methods of contraception on their website and have a tool where users can identify which would suit them best , visit @entity203			0
