' we bought good players , i believe we 've done remarkably well in the transfer market			1
we wanted one more player , but could n't			1
we will try to rectify that in january			2
' we have a good core of young @entity37 players , who feel the value of our club			2

i know i do n't always please you like i love to , but we give it all to make you happy , ' @entity0 added			1
' let ’s remember last season , we started with a home defeat and i felt a little tsunami around the club			0

' what has changed compared with a few years ago is other clubs have resources so top players have more choices			2
we signed ( @entity87 ) @entity86 which gave us comfort			2
we made 79 points and you have to be consistent for that			0
