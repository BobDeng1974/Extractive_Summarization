@entity1 will need millions more immigrants to cope with an ageing population , the official economic watchdog warned today			1
the @entity4 said that opening the doors to an extra 140,000 every year for five decades would boost employment and bolster the public finances			1
it also warned that pressure on the @entity1 ’s healthcare system caring for older people means an extra £ 19 billion of spending cuts or tax hikes will be needed			1
open door policy : without high levels of migration to @entity1 , public debt will balloon to become larger than the entire economy , the @entity4 said urgent action is needed or the gains made by @entity22 ’s spending cuts will be wiped out by increased spending on the elderly , the @entity4 said			1
health , pension and social care costs are already equivalent to 14 per cent of @entity1 ’s economy but by 2062 - 63 it will rise to almost 20 per cent			0
the @entity4 argues that allowing 140,000 immigrants of working age into @entity1 each year – totalling 7million over 50 years – would fill jobs and raise taxes for @entity35 coffers			1
‘ our sensitivity analysis shows that overall migration has a positive impact on the sustainability of the public finances over our 50 year horizon , ’ the @entity4 said			2
it said that if there is a steady flow of immigrants into @entity1 , government borrowing would rise to 99 per cent of gdp			2
but if there is a bar on immigration , borrowing would hit 174 per cent			0
‘ these results are driven by the assumed age structure of net migration , which tends to be more concentrated in the working age group and hence reduces the dependency ratio throughout the projection period			0
’ warning : gains made by @entity22 's spending cuts could be wiped out by increased pressure on the public finances from @entity1 's ageing population however , @entity63 has pledged to reduce net migration to the ‘ tens of thousands ’ and last year the number of immigrants fell by 89,000 to 153,00			1
without action to address the burden of an ageing population , the @entity1 will be left with a £ 65 billion hole in its finances , according to the @entity4			1
in its annual fiscal sustainability report , it said : ‘ it is clear that longer - term spending pressures , if unaddressed , would put the public finances on an unsustainable path			0
’ ‘ public sector net debt would approach 100 per cent of gross domestic product ( gdp ) and still be rising , ’ it added			0
the @entity4 said the move to a single - tier state pension had slightly eased the pressure on public sector debt , but added that spending on healthcare was the biggest spending pressure over the next 50 years			2
the @entity4 said the cost of the state pension was predicted to rise from 5.8 per cent of gdp to 8.4 per cent of @entity47 as the population ages , even with the introduction of the new flat rate payment system and increase in retirement age to 67 taken into account			0
healthcare spending is expected to increase from 7 per cent of gdp to 8.8 per cent of @entity47 , while long - term social care costs are set to rise from 1.3 per cent of gdp to 2.4 per cent of gdp			0
the @entity4 also warned that declining @entity97 oil reserves will take its toll , with oil and gas revenues expected to plunge from 0.4 per cent of gdp now to almost negligible levels - at 0.03 per cent of gdp by 2040			0
but action taken so far by the government , including an extra year of spending cuts to 2017 - 18 and the single tier state pension , is helping to offset some of the pressures , the report added			1
the @entity4 's @entity110 warned of ' huge uncertainties around the scale of the challenge ' of dealing with the costs of more elderly people @entity110 , chairman of the @entity4 , said on presenting the report : ‘ since last year , the underlying deficit and debt path look less favourable			2
‘ but this and the costs of long - term care reform are likely to be offset by the government 's announcement of additional spending cuts in 2017 - 18 and savings from the single tier pension			1
‘ that said , there are huge uncertainties around the scale of the challenge and the @entity1 is certainly not alone in confronting it			0
’ he added that the extra £ 19 billion needed to get borrowing back on track could be spread over the next 50 years rather than action taken in one go			0
in a written statement , chief secretary to the treasury @entity135 said the @entity4 's report shows that without the steps taken over the past year , public borrowing would be around 50 per cent of gdp higher in 50 years ' time			2
he added that the report identifies the extra spending cuts as ‘ one of the key factors in containing the growth of spending over the long - term , demonstrating the importance of the government 's programme of fiscal consolidation for the long - term health of the public finances ’ .			1

140,000 extra immigrants to the @entity1 are needed every year until 2063
@entity4 says *foreign* workers needed to raise tax
@entity22 's spending cuts will be wiped out by ageing population
