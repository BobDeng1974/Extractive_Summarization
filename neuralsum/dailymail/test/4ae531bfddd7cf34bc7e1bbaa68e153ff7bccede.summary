@entity0 has warned @entity2 's @entity1 admirers that if they want to sign @entity4 this summer then the bidding will have to start at £ 20million			1
it has been suggested that a £ 10m bid could tempt @entity2 into selling the winger , who has excelled since @entity0 arrived in january and launched the club up the table			1
but the @entity2 manager is adamant that the club 's leading assets do not want to leave – and any players that do go will not be sold cheaply			1

he said : ' @entity63 achieved fantastic results here last season			0
for sure i would n't be here and a lot of these players would n't be here if he had n't done that , so we are thankful to him			0
' he should also be thankful that we are in the position we are in , and that the players and myself have got the team where it is , because the reception could have been very different if we were in the relegations zone and leaving so shortly before the season started			0
i think that is good for him and he deserves that			0
hopefully tomorrow he gets the reception that he warrants			0
