@entity1 's prime minister was jailed for around three minutes yesterday after he was convicted of contempt in a bizarre court case			0
the country 's @entity4 ruled @entity6 would be sentenced ' until the rising of the court , ' or until the judges left the chamber			1
that happened about three minutes after the verdict was handed down , and then @entity6 was released			2
the case has stoked political tensions in the country and the ruling against @entity6 appeared to be a compromise			1
but the case could still mean problems for @entity6 because he has been convicted in a court			1
that means he could face dismissal from office in the weeks , or more likely , months to come			0
his lawyer said he would appeal the verdict , further delaying any action that could see @entity6 lose his job			2
@entity6 ( centre - right ) was convicted of contempt of court , but the @entity4 imposed only a symbolic punishment supporters of @entity1 's @entity43 shout slogans after their leader @entity6 ( not in picture ) arrived at the @entity4 @entity6 was found guilty for failing to write to the @entity48 authorities to ask them to re-open graft cases against president @entity21 , who heads the @entity51 the case against president @entity21 , pictured here holding a picture of his late wife @entity54 , involves kickbacks he and mrs @entity54 , a former prime minister , allegedly received from @entity48 companies when she was in power in the 1990s * @entity6 was summoned before the @entity4 on january 19 for failing to take steps to re-open money - laundering proceedings against president @entity21			1
he was indicted for contempt of court on february 13			0
* the civilian - judicial confrontation stems from thousands of cases thrown out in 2007 under an amnesty ordered by former military president @entity64 , which paved the way for a return to civilian rule			0
* @entity21 was the decree 's most prominent beneficiary			2
he became the main target of the court when it voided the measure in 2009 and ordered the government to ask @entity48 authorities to restart legal action against him			0
* the cases date back to the 1990s , when @entity21 had multiple cases of corruption lodged against him , including accusations of money laundering using @entity48 accounts			1
he says all the cases are false and politically motivated			0
* @entity6 and his advisers have defied the court , citing the president 's constitutional immunity as head of state			1
the prime minister appealed the court 's decision to charge him with contempt , but that appeal was dismissed in february			0
elections are scheduled for later this year or early next , meaning it is quite possible the government could see out its term with @entity6 still in charge			2
@entity6 smiled when the verdict was read out in a packed court house			0
@entity6 is the longest - serving prime minister in the history of @entity1 , where civilian governments have repeatedly been toppled by the country 's powerful military , often with the support of the @entity4 , which critics allege is heavily politicized			1
corruption charges have routinely been used to target those in power , or seeking to return			0
the source of the current conflict is a graft case against president @entity21 that involves kickbacks he and his late wife , former prime minister @entity54 , allegedly received from @entity48 companies when @entity54 was in power in the 1990s			1
they were found guilty in absentia in a @entity48 court in 2003			0
@entity21 appealed , but @entity48 prosecutors ended up dropping the case in 2008 after the @entity1 government approved an ordinance giving the president and others immunity from old corruption cases that many agreed were politically motivated			1
the @entity1 @entity4 ruled the ordinance unconstitutional in 2009 and ordered the government to write a letter to @entity48 authorities requesting they reopen the case against @entity21			1
@entity6 has refused , saying the @entity1 constitution grants the president immunity from criminal prosecution while in office .			2

@entity6 faces dismissal because of @entity4 conviction
@entity4 refuses to reopen old corruption case against president @entity21
