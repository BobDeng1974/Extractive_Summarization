@entity1 paceman @entity0 thrived on a fast @entity3 pitch to capture five wickets but the tourists made hard work of a three - wicket victory over @entity8 in the second one - day international			1
@entity0 's return of 5 - 21 was his best in one - day cricket and helped skittle @entity8 for a paltry 154 runs from only 41.4 overs on a day of brilliant sunshine in @entity15			1
although losing both openers cheaply in reply and stumbling to 153 - 7 , captain @entity18 ( 48 ) and @entity19 ( 22 not out ) ensured a regulation victory with more than 22 overs to spare , levelling the five - match series 1 - 1			1
@entity1 paceman @entity0 thrived on a fast @entity3 pitch to capture five @entity25 wickets @entity8 's innings began disastrously , with @entity0 having the dangerous @entity27 caught behind for a duck before the same bowler caught @entity30 for eight at mid-on off the bowling of @entity33 ( 3 - 31 )			1
@entity34 ( 11 ) and @entity35 ( 10 ) also went cheaply before @entity36 ( 25 ) and @entity8 's top scorer @entity37 ( 67 ) steadied the innings with a 58 - run partnership			2
@entity40 broke the stand , however , with @entity42 taking a fine catch low at mid-on to remove @entity36 , before @entity0 had wicketkeeper @entity44 caught behind for 19 and @entity45 bowled for a duck in the same over			2
batsman @entity34 ( 11 ) went cheaply as @entity8 lost by three wickets in @entity15 @entity0 captured his fifth wicket when @entity49 edged behind for three , leaving the hosts reeling at 129 - 8 and their hopes of building a solid total in tatters			1
@entity8 quicks @entity54 and @entity49 struck early to remove openers @entity57 ( 4 ) and @entity58 ( 10 ) before @entity59 contributed a valuable 30 before swiping a nick behind off part - time spinner @entity45			0
@entity42 and @entity18 drove @entity1 to a comfortable 113 - 3 before @entity54 struck to remove @entity42 for 19 and @entity62 for a duck in successive balls			0
@entity65 , seen here losing his wicket in the first odi , has been ruled out of the series through injury @entity19 survived the hat - trick ball and an onslaught of short - pitched bowling from left - armer @entity49 , but @entity54 struck again to remove @entity18 and @entity40 for a duck for another chance at a hat - trick			0
@entity33 defied @entity54 , however , and slogged his third delivery over the bowler to the fence to bring up the winning runs			0
@entity54 was the pick of the @entity25 bowlers with 5 - 31			0
the third odi will be played in @entity82 on wednesday .			0

@entity1 won by three wickets in their second odi against @entity8
their win at the @entity3 levels the series at 1 - 1
@entity0 thrived on fast pitch , taking five wickets
