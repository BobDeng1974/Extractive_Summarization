the beautiful @entity11 has been transformed into an ombre - haired @entity42 , while the usually angelic @entity43 looks somewhat menacing as a @entity45 tattoo artist			2
@entity13 and @entity16 are channeling glam rock and 50s pin - up girl chic , with upswept hair , corsets and plenty of attitude			1
magical transformation : @entity13 is looking glam and set to go the ball in drawing by @entity6 pin up : @entity16 is still stealing @entity57 's heart with this sassy look , reminiscent of the iconic ' @entity60 ' poster while @entity61 has tattoos of her mouse friends , @entity16 has her loyal companion dopey on her arm , as well as the iconic poison apple			1
@entity12 seems to have got her festival gear on , sporting teeny - tiny shorts , as well as a @entity70 piercing and plenty of black eyeliner			2
a very 21st century princess : @entity7 artist @entity74 gives the princesses a hipster makeover and @entity14 is looking bang on trend with blue dip - dyed hair - although we 're not sure that her father the @entity81 would be happy with her multiple facial piercings or neck tattoo of her tiger buddy @entity85			1
