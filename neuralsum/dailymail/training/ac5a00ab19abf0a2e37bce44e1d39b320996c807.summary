by @entity0 published : 06:28 est , 1 july 2013 updated : 07:34 est , 1 july 2013 wrongly accused : @entity1 has been extradited from @entity2 to @entity3 twice for crimes he did not commit 30 years ago because he shares the same name and birth date as the accused a @entity2 truck driver has been arrested and tried twice for a crime he did not commit because he shares the same name and birth date as the wanted man			1
@entity1 has been extradited on both occasions from his home in the southern state to a jail cell in @entity3 , where he has been locked up before eventually facing a judge			2
mr @entity1 , who lost his job in both incidences , is now trying to recover his losses and is outraged that the police and the judiciary could make the same mistake twice			1
speaking to the @entity25 , he said : ' it should n't happen twice ; it should n't even happen at all - never , ever			0
' while mr @entity1 's criminal record is not exactly spotless , it was his previous conviction for a rape charge which was evidence that he did not commit an armed robbery and kidnapping 30 years ago			1
at the time of the alleged crime , which took place in @entity37 , @entity38 on christmas day in 1983 , mr @entity1 was serving a six - year jail term for his sex crime			1
but in 2008 , the truck driver was picked up by police at his @entity2 home , and flown to @entity38 , where he spent two months in jail			1
he eventually proved his innocence with his previous prison record , and the courts let mr @entity1 walk free			2
having lost his job once for a crime he did not commit , mr @entity1 was shocked to be arrested and extradited a second time for the same crime			1
local police in @entity2 , in southern @entity52 , found an old arrest warrant for mr @entity1 from before his 2008 case , and contacted @entity56			1
since back then they thought this was the man they were looking for , the mug - shot , finger prints as well as name and date of birth all matched the old warrant			0
@entity2 police looked into mr @entity1 's file while he was serving a five - day sentence for drink driving			1
after he finished serving his driving while intoxicated ( @entity70 ) jail term , he was sent back to his prison cell - for another month - to await extradition back to @entity38			0
flabbergasted he was being arrested again for the same kidnapping case , mr @entity1 told them : ' you 're the ones kidnapping me			2
' after showing the @entity2 police officers his court order from 2008 proving his innocence , he told the @entity82 paper : ' they just looked at each other			2
they told me there was nothing they could do			0
' evidence : footage from the court video shows how mr @entity93 , holding out his court order letter , explained to the @entity3 judge that his was not the man they were looking for			0
the judge appeared baffled after a month being held in the @entity2 cell , officers from @entity3 came to fly him handcuffed to @entity38 , to face another judge the next day			0
when he was brought before the court , mr @entity1 once again presented his court order as evidence of his innocence			2
a baffled judge questioned the situation with mr @entity1 's attorney before ordering his release			0
the police in @entity38 claimed the truck driver ' failed to inform anyone that this was a case of mistaken identity ' - something refuted by mr @entity1			1
law enforcement authorities in @entity2 said he presented them with the evidence , but @entity56 said they still wanted him arrested			0
@entity118 , @entity119 state attorney told the paper : ' if an innocent person is charged with a crime , a guilty person walks free			0
neither situation should ever happen			0
' hopefully , now , however , mr @entity1 will never again face the courts for the same crime , after the police placed an alert against his name , locally and nationally , indicating that he is not the man wanted for the 1983 kidnapping .			1

@entity1 , from @entity2 , cleared his name of the kidnapping in 2008 after being wrongly accused of the 1983 attack
but records were not updated and police *re-arrested* him after finding an old arrest warrant
@entity3 cops extradited him from @entity2 for a second time for the same crimes
mr @entity1 was able to prove his innocence - because he was in jail at the time of the kidnapping serving a prison sentence for rape
the truck driver , who lost two jobs through the errors , is trying to reclaim his losses
