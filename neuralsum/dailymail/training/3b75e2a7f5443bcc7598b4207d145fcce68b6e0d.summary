by @entity0 published : 12:28 est , 21 march 2013 updated : 12:41 est , 21 march 2013 the number of people living till 90 has trebled in the last 30 years nearly half a million people in @entity5 and @entity6 have lived to see their 90th birthday			1
the explosion in the population of elderly people means that numbers of nonagenarians have trebled in 30 years , official estimates said			2
the fast - rising ranks of those surviving into great old age come from a ' golden generation ' that has reaped the benefits of modern health care and affluence , the @entity14 said			1
details of the expansion of the population of the very oldest people follow a series of recent warnings that the rules governing retirement , pensions and hospital and home care of the elderly need to be rewritten to cope			2
a @entity35 report earlier this month said older people must be ready to work longer into what would once have been retirement years to be able to pay the costs of living longer			1
the new estimates say there were 440,290 people aged 90 and over living in @entity5 and @entity6 in 2011 , just less than one in 100 of the whole population			1
nonagenarian numbers have gone up by 26 per cent in only nine years since 2002			0
the rate of increase means that there are likely to be more than 500,000 90 - somethings by 2015			0
a growing number of the very old are making it to their 100th birthday , the figures show			0
there were an estimated 11,700 centenarians in 2011 , with men aged over 100 outnumbered six to one by women			1
centenarians have doubled in number since 1998 and there were more than four times as many people over 100 in 2011 as in 1983			1
before the @entity64 there were only 100 centenarians in the country			2
in 1917 , when @entity68 sent out the first 100th birthday congratulatory telegrams , @entity67 despatched just 24			0
by 1980 numbers of centenarians had grown to more than 2,000			2
some 570 people are now thought to be aged over 105			2
the @entity14 said that among the very old was one particular group , now aged between their late seventies and their late eighties , who are the greatest beneficiaries of greater health and wealth			0
@entity78 cohort : those born between 1926 and 1935 have seen improvements in mortality in recent years ( file photo ) ' people born between 1926 and 1935 are often referred to as the ' golden cohort '			1
in particular those born around 1930 have experienced improvements in mortality in recent years than no cohort has experienced previously or since , ' the @entity14 report said			0
' the effect of their greater rates of improvement in mortality contributes to the overall improvements in mortality at older ages			0
' the report added that the latest increase in numbers of those over 90 was a result of the baby boom that followed the @entity64			0
' there is a steady decline in the proportion of 90 - year - olds over the period 2004 to 2008			0
these people would have been born during the @entity64 years 1914 to 1918 , so this reflects the steady decline in births in @entity5 and @entity6 during the war			1
' the low point in births in 1918 was followed by a large increase in births post war			0
' @entity5 and @entity6 now rank seventh in the international league table of the very old , the @entity14 said			1
@entity118 has the greatest proportion of over- 90s , with 1,131 90 - somethings for every 100,000 people			0
@entity122 , @entity123 , @entity124 , @entity125 and @entity126 follow , and @entity5 and @entity6 have 765 over- 90s for every 100,000 .			1
