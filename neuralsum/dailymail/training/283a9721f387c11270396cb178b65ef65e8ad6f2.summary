the @entity26 has one of the highest @entity50 incidence rates in the world - affecting an average of 1,870 people each year - and the disease can kill in hours			2
it kills more children under five than any other infectious disease in the @entity26 , around 10 per cent , and experts calculate a further third are left with disabilities			2
professor @entity61 , deputy chief medical officer , said at the time of the vaccine being approved : ‘ we will now be working closely with @entity39 in the coming months and , if negotiations are successful , we hope to work with the other @entity26 health departments to introduce a vaccine to prevent meningitis b as quickly as possible			1
’ campaigners hoped the decision meant babies could be getting jabs as early as the summer			1
dr @entity73 , head of the vaccine division at @entity39 , said the company had increased production to meet the expected demands of the new programme			1
but if it does not start by the end of 2014 , it will have to throw away more than a million doses of vaccine that could have been given to @entity26 babies and children			1
he has personally offered to meet @entity29 to ensure any possible obstacles are ironed out , but has never met him			0
support : in january , 118 leading doctors wrote a letter urging mr @entity29 to give the jab the green light he said ‘ it is very frustrating and very sad because children keep on dying when we could do something about it			1
‘ when the vaccine was licensed 18 months ago we wanted to make sure nothing on our side would hold up negotiations on the price of the product			2
‘ we understand there needs to be a proper price that the minister can support but discussions have not started			2
’ meningitis is a disease that terrifies parents and health professionals alike			0
with symptoms that can appear flu - like , it can turn overnight into a life - threatening condition			0
if meningitis - related blood infection takes hold , often the only way to save a child ’s life is to amputate a limb			0
hundreds of children are left disabled every year			2
some forms of the disease have been wiped out by vaccination , but meningitis b , the most common form , has remained a killer			0
the new vaccine is estimated to cover 88 per cent of cases in the @entity26			0
over the past decade there have been more than 10,000 cases recorded in @entity131 and @entity132 , with 500 deaths			0

@entity144 , of the charity @entity145 , said : ‘ we have had no further information about the timetable for introducing this vaccine , since the positive decision was announced at the end of march this year			1
‘ previous new vaccine introductions have had really clear leadership within the @entity43 , with a director of @entity154			0
‘ with this position no longer existing and following all the changes in the @entity43 and @entity31 , we are concerned this will lead to delays			0
‘ our latest figures suggest that around 800 @entity50 cases in the @entity26 could have been prevented since the vaccine was licensed for use in january 2013			0
every day brings more cases and more misery			0
’ dr @entity73 said production of the vaccine had been stepped up to meet the needs of @entity26 children , but the expiry dates were fast approaching			2
‘ if the programme does not start by the end of 2014 , we will have to throw away more than a million doses that could have protected them ’ he added			0
a @entity43 spokesperson said : ‘ we want to agree a price as soon as possible so children can benefit from the vaccine , but we need to make sure @entity31 funds are used effectively and it is right we follow due process to make sure this happens			2
‘ senior figures from the department , including the deputy chief medical officer , have already met with @entity39			0
