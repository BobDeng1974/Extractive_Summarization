it was a hectic summer of comings and goings at @entity3 , with the deadwood quickly being shifted out to make way for the exciting and expensive new acquisitions demanded by @entity7			1
but is there life after @entity10 ? we have a look at how those who departed have been faring at their new clubs in the early part of the season			1
@entity17 ( sold to @entity18 on deadline day for £ 16m ) no two ways about it , @entity17 looks a new player since swapping @entity3 for the @entity23			1
revitalised and rejuventated , the @entity25 striker has scored four goals in his first five matches for the @entity28 and looks to be enjoying his football again			2
@entity17 has enjoyed a new lease of life after leaving @entity10 for @entity18 @entity17 scored a hat - trick in @entity18 's 4 - 1 win over @entity34 in the @entity35 on wednesday @entity17 's move made perfect sense , with @entity10 bringing in @entity38 and captain @entity39 undroppable , he was going to rot if he remained			1
at @entity18 , he has game time and a fresh sense of purpose			1
@entity43 said his performance against @entity34 on wednesday , in which he scored his first ever hat - trick , was ' electric ' and more goals appear inevitable			0
8/10 @entity48 ( released ; joined @entity49 in july ) the vastly experienced centre back , 35 , was not expected to play a great deal in @entity10 's defence this season and his 12 years of service at @entity3 came to an end			1
as it happens , @entity56 could have done with @entity58 after a debilitating injury crisis left him desperately short at the back			0
the former @entity25 man may not have been the solution , however , judging by the poor start he has made at @entity64			0
@entity49 have conceded 13 goals in the six matches @entity48 has featured			2
he was at fault for their opening day defeat by @entity71 when he allowed @entity72 to score the winner from a corner and he was tormented by @entity75 in the 2 - 2 draw with @entity77 a fortnight ago.4 / 10 @entity48 has struggled to shore up @entity49 's leaky defence since arriving at @entity64 during the summer @entity79 ( joined @entity80 on a free transfer in july ) @entity79 , 32 , insisted his summer move to @entity83 was a ' step forward ' in his career but things did n't get off to the best of starts			1
he endured a nightmare debut at @entity90 , conceding a penalty in the first half before being sent off late on for sracasticaly applauding the referee			0
after serving a one - match suspension , @entity79 returned against @entity95 but was caught out just three minutes in , losing the ball to @entity97 who went on to score			2
and things did n't get much better in sunday 's 4 - 1 home defeat by @entity100 as the @entity80 defence was ripped open time after time			0
@entity79 also conceded a penalty when he hauled down @entity103			2
4/10 @entity79 has been responsible for some costly errors at the beginning of his @entity80 career @entity107 ( joined @entity108 for an undisclosed fee in august ) on the scrapheap at @entity3 , @entity107 made a wise decision and returned to the club where he made his name - @entity108			1
he immediately reminded the ' @entity114 ' what they 'd been missing with a goal against @entity118 on his first match back and has been pretty good since			0
he showed something like his best form in @entity108 's 3 - 0 @entity35 win over @entity123 on wednesday , setting up two goals and showing the kind of incisive passing that persuaded @entity10 to sign him in the first place			1
sir @entity129 admitted to @entity130 that he failed with @entity107 but it looks like he is now slowly returning to his full ability			1
7/10 @entity107 has been impressive since returning to first club @entity108 @entity133 ( sold to @entity134 for £ 1.2m in july ) with the big money arrival of @entity136 , @entity133 's opportunities , like those of @entity79 and @entity48 , appeared limited and he moved on to @entity134			1
the @entity139 , 33 , has made a good start to his career in @entity83 , helping his new team to four consecutive clean sheets in @entity144 and the @entity35			0
they were finally breached by @entity146 on wednesday night , suffering a 1 - 0 defeat			0
@entity133 has claimed that the move has reawoken a sense of sacrifice for the cause that had gone missing at @entity3			1
he told @entity153 newspaper @entity152 : ' now there are so many strong players , but i do not know if they are for @entity157 - for this club you have to sacrifice everything			0
that is the culture that i have rediscovered at @entity134			2
' 8/10 @entity133 in action for @entity134 during their @entity35 match with @entity146 this week @entity164 ( loaned to @entity165 ) @entity164 admitted he would have to leave @entity3 to shake off the negativity that has surrounded him over the last two years and he 's started well enough at @entity165			1
his debut came in a 1 - 0 win over @entity170 at @entity171 and manager @entity172 described his display as ' fantastic			0
' back - to - back 3 - 0 losses to @entity18 and @entity175 were less encouraging but @entity164 has the perfect chance to rebuild his reputation at @entity178			1
6/10 @entity164 takes on @entity175 's @entity179 during @entity165 's 3 - 0 defeat at @entity181 on saturday @entity182 ( loaned to @entity183 ) like @entity17 , @entity182 knew he would only get a regular run of games away from @entity3			1
to that end , @entity183 was n't the obvious destination but he 's done fairly well so far			2
@entity182 has been a popular addition with fans and team - mates alike and he opened his account with two goals in the 8 - 2 win over @entity194			1
his role will continue to be making an impact from the bench but @entity198 did start him against @entity199 in the @entity35			0
unfortunately , he missed a really good close - range chance and @entity201 , the man who replaced him in the second - half , went on to score the winner			0
7/10 @entity182 in action for @entity183 against @entity199 in the @entity35 @entity206 ( loaned to @entity207 ) with little to no chance of playing for @entity10 this season , @entity206 returned to @entity207			1
he 's certainly been playing more and even scoring - against @entity210 in the @entity35 and against @entity211 in the @entity213 league			0
but the club 's form has been disappointing and they sit seventh in the table after 10 games			0
@entity206 missed a penalty against @entity219 during his first game back and was involved in a bizarre incident against @entity222 when he and @entity223 tries to carry off an opponent they believed was play - acting late in the game , leading to the latter getting sent off			0
5/10 @entity206 takes on @entity175 's @entity228 during the sides ' @entity35 meeting on tuesday @entity231 ( loaned to @entity232 ) the ' forgotten one ' under @entity234 , @entity235 was n't likely to fare much better under @entity56 and returned to @entity232 to try and salvage his talent			2
he started well enough , scoring the @entity232 ' last - minute equaliser in a 3 - 3 draw at @entity239			0
he has since started in the goalless draw with @entity241 and the @entity243 loss to @entity239			0
@entity235 seems to be slowly but surely rediscovering his touch but a permanent move away from @entity10 would be sensible			1
7/10 @entity231 on the ball for @entity232 during their @entity243 tie with @entity239 last week @entity247 ( sold to @entity248 for £ 4.4m in june ) @entity10 got a decent price for the long - forgotten left - back and the 25 - year - old is seeking to resurrect his career in the @entity254 capital			1
he has started seven matches this season but expressed his exasperation that all anyone wants to talk about is his time at @entity10			2
6/10 @entity247 playing for @entity248 against @entity260 in the @entity261 @entity262 ( joined @entity263 on a free in july ) one - week wonder @entity262 had spent most of his @entity3 career on loan and was only likely to flourish if he moved away permanently			0
he is featuring for @entity263 but his only two goals so far came at @entity267 in the @entity243			0
4/10 @entity262 finds the net in @entity263 's match with @entity270 - but it 's disallowed @entity271 ( sold to @entity272 for £ 2.4m ) arguably the biggest flop of the @entity129 era , @entity271 finally left the club for @entity272 over the summer			2
he scored on his debut as @entity272 beat @entity277 to win the supercup but has n't played since			0

it was a busy summer of departures at @entity10 as @entity7 cleared out the deadwood to make way for expensive new signings
@entity17 looks revitalised since his £ 16m move to @entity18
@entity107 is returning to his *brilliant* best for @entity108
@entity133 has played full part in @entity134 ' *frugal* defence
but @entity48 and @entity79 have struggled
@entity182 has proved popular on loan at @entity183
@entity231 and @entity164 also have chance to rebuild reputation
