another version of events that night , which reported that the gang were defeated by the @entity3 brothers , clearly rankled the man on the video , who wore a balaclava to conceal his face while he shrieked into the camera			1
he screeched : ' ask him to explain this : why have i got his f * * * ing @entity26 keys , you waste , why have i got this @entity137 f * * * ing wallet - it 's yours , you waste , and it 's got your € 500 in it			0
