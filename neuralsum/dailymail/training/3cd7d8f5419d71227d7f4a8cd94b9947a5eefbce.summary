by @entity0 last updated at 3:27 pm on 27th september 2011 thousands of civilians have been given sweeping police - style powers allowing them to fine people and demand personal details			1
following a worrying expansion of a discredited @entity13 project , more than 2,200 civilians including street wardens , housing officers , traffic marshals and stewards can issue financial penalties for ‘ offences ’ such as dropping litter , dog fouling and truancy			1
coalition ministers have allowed the numbers signed up to the @entity21 to grow by a third over just 12 months			1
new powers : 2,200 civilians , such as these street wardens in @entity24 , will be able to fine the public following an expansion in the number of people able to issue penalties for ' offences ' such as dropping litter it comes despite senior @entity31 and @entity32 strongly condemning the scheme when in opposition			1
under it , councils and private sector firms pay a few hundred pounds for accreditation by the local police force			1
they then pay as little as £ 32 for each employee they want to be accredited			1
those chosen undergo a short training course and are given a uniform and a special badge approved by the chief constable			2
as well as handing out fines of up to £ 80 , the accredited civilians – dubbed ‘ @entity50 ’s @entity49 ’ after the former @entity13 home secretary – can photograph members of the public and demand their names and addresses			2
it is an offence to refuse to provide such details when they ask			2
but they have no power to detain or arrest and must call a police officer or @entity62			2
before the election , former shadow home secretary @entity63 – who is now attorney general – said the scheme was ‘ a consequence of the government ’s obsession with policing on the cheap ’			1
and @entity70 , now a cabinet minister , said the scheme was part of the ‘ slow march towards instant justice ’			1
but @entity76 documents uncovered by the @entity77 reveal a startling expansion of the @entity21 last year			2
hundreds of organisations have signed up , including councils , shopping centres , @entity80 , the @entity82 and the @entity83			2
there are huge concentrations of accredited civilians in some areas – including 366 in @entity88 , 223 in @entity89 , and 124 in @entity90			0
in @entity93 , @entity94 and @entity95 , by contrast , the police forces do not operate the scheme at all			1
@entity97 , vice chairman of the @entity98 , said : ‘ i ’m sure that the public would have huge concerns knowing that we have people walking around in this pseudo-enforcement role without proper accountability and legitimacy			0
’ @entity106 , director of civil liberties campaign group @entity107 , said : ‘ in some cases this appears to be policing on the cheap , in others it is downright ridiculous			0
the @entity113 should recognise the risk this scheme poses to civil liberties and urgently act to curtail it			1
’ in may , the @entity77 requested details of the numbers accredited under the scheme from @entity76 officials , using the @entity121			1
officials initially refused to answer , claiming a policy review was under way , but they have since done so , revealing that in 2008 , 1,406 individuals were accredited under @entity21			0
that increased by almost a fifth to 1,667 the following year			0
but by the end of last year the total had rocketed to 2,219 , a rise of 33 per cent			0
in 2008 there were 95 ‘ approved organisations ’ allowed to enrol individuals onto the scheme			1
by december last year that figure hit 153 , up more than 60 per cent			0
if the numbers accredited have continued to grow at the same rate the total will now be approaching 3,000			0
a @entity76 spokesman said : ‘ creating safer communities is n’t just a job for the police , it ’s about all of us taking responsibility for the areas where we live and working with the police to challenge and tackle low level crime and anti-social behaviour			0
‘ @entity148 persons assist the police and the public in dealing with low level crime and disorder			0
‘ @entity21 frees up police time , allowing officers to respond to more serious crime , and providing a localised partnership approach to keeping the public safe			0
’ the @entity83 said the powers allowed volunteers to act as traffic marshals during road races			0
a spokesman said : ‘ this has been a useful tool to keep the police costs down			0

move comes despite senior @entity31 and @entity32 strongly condemning the scheme when in opposition
