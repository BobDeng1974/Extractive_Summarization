headmaster @entity39 insists the material is not explicit and is in line with national curriculum guidelines			0
but parents including @entity44 – who has four children aged five to ten at the 319 - pupil school – are furious			1
‘ there is a great deal of material in there which children do n’t need to know at such a young age , ’ the 41 - year - old said			1
