by @entity0 a @entity2 - educated artist and sculptor has come up with a highly bizarre , but probably very effective , ' personal space ' creating dress			2
@entity6 , who is currently based in @entity7 , designed the motorized dress after experiencing repeated instances of men crowding her on public transportation networks			1
the ruffled pink and white creation does n't spring out suddenly in the fashion of an umbrella , as it looks like it might , but rather senses a looming presence , and slowly expands outwards			0
ta - da ! artist @entity6 has created a personal space creating dress , which expands to ward off strangers who lurk too close ' i wanted to explore how wearable technology could impact a person 's physical world , ' she writes on her website , @entity28			1
' so i began to look for ways women could take more ownership over their personal space in public			0
' ms @entity6 built the dress herself and used ' proximity sensors ' to identify when a lurker gets too close for comfort , and plastic scaffolding within the garment to enable the hemline to expand			1
stay away ! ms @entity6 's dress may be ' playful ' but sexual harassment is no joke , with cases on public transport networks frequently reported all over the world the artist points out that women in particular tend to experience the matter of personal space very differently , according to their age , race or social standing for example			1
' how would [ different types of women ] use technology to augment their experience of public space , given the opportunity ? ' she poses			0
while she admits her ' personal space dress ' is a ' playful ' creation , the sexual harassment of women who ride mass transit is no joke			1
geek chic : the dress is triggered to expand by ' proximity sensors ' built within the garment , not in an umbrella - quick motion , but rather a slow , gentle extension most of us have experienced unwanted leering on the subway , but plenty have dealt with worse in busy , thriving cities around the world			2
a survey two weeks ago conducted by the @entity81 system , which covers trains and buses , revealed that one in five riders say they 've been sexually harassed in the past month			1
in @entity86 , the problem has become so alarming that their @entity81 system has introduced ' women - only ' cars on their trains during rush hour			0
inventive : the @entity94 artist , who is currently a student at @entity7 's @entity95 , says she wanted to explore ' how wearable technology could impact a person 's psychical world ' indeed , the @entity99 reported a major @entity101 transit hearing in 2009 , which found that sexual harassment is the number one offense which ' affects the quality of urban life ' on subways			1
police said the peak times for those arrests was during morning and afternoon rush hours			0
ms @entity6 's dress , while comical to behold and admittedly entirely impractical , was designed more to establish a point than to actually manufacture and sell			2
' i wanted to explore how wearable technology could impact a person 's physical world ' long - term , she says she wants this dress , and other similar pieces , to be become ' instructables ' - to exist in an online library whereby anyone can download the instructions and tech code , and build one themselves , for whatever reason			0
other wacky ' wearable electronics ' she has created as part of her growing @entity129 project , include a scarf with a built - in pollution sensor ; which pops up to form a protective filter against cigarette smoke or car exhaust fumes			0
ms @entity6 is currently pursuing a masters in @entity136 and @entity137 , at @entity138 .			0

the ' playful ' dress is triggered by sensors when someone strays too close
artist @entity6 was *inspired* by her own *frustrations* with men crowding her
one in five @entity81 passengers in @entity148 say they have suffered sexual harassment in the past month
