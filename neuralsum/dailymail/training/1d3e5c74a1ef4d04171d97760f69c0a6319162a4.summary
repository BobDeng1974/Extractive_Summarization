@entity2 would not be allowed to play in @entity3 if @entity4 broke away from @entity5 , the country 's football league chief @entity0 said as tensions mounted in the region over the possibility of an independence referendum next month			1
@entity0 explained that the country 's sports law entitles only one @entity14 territory - @entity12 - to legally participate in the league or other official competition , and @entity12 already competes in the @entity18 league system			1
with @entity3 already seen as a two - team competition ( although @entity22 won the title last season to break @entity25 and @entity2 's nine - season long duopoly ) the loss of the @entity21 giants would be a huge blow for the league 's competitiveness			1
@entity18 giants @entity2 would technically have to leave @entity3 if @entity4 becomes independent @entity31 ( right ) is in favour of the referendum on @entity21 independence taking place next month @entity36 ( right ) also supports the referendum and said the fact he is a @entity18 international is irrelevant ' if @entity4 became independent , taking into consideration the @entity40 that would be enforced by the rest of @entity5 , @entity2 would n't be allowed to play , ' @entity0 , the president of the @entity38 , told a sports conference in @entity2			1
' there would have to be a change in the law made in the @entity18 @entity46			0
' clearly if it happened then it would be detrimental for @entity18 football to lose @entity2			2
' i ca n't imagine the @entity38 without @entity2			0
in the same way as i ca n't imagine @entity4 without @entity5 , i ca n't see @entity3 without @entity2			1
also if it did happen what would you call the league : the @entity3 or the @entity56 ? ' the fact that @entity12 - a tiny state straddling the @entity59 that separate @entity5 from @entity60 - is allowed to play in the league creates a precedent however that could permit the @entity21 clubs ' eventual inclusion			1
@entity2 , with superstars like @entity65 in their team , could be made to play in the @entity67 @entity31 and @entity36 are among the @entity2 players who have come out in support of holding an independence referendum on november 9 , following a september rally in @entity2 in favour of the vote , attended by 1.8 million people according to the police			1
the @entity21 government will decide by october 15 whether to hold a referndum			0
' we have all the right in the world to vote			0
we need to vote , we need the people to show their opinions and i am in favour of the referendum obviously , ' @entity31 told a news conference			1
both he and @entity36 were or currently are @entity5 internationals and the latter says that he still gives his all when playing for @entity5			2
' i am @entity21 and i wanted to take part in the rally			0
i went with friends to have a good time with the other 1.8 million that were there , ' @entity36 told reporters			0
@entity96 ( left ) and @entity65 celebrate the @entity98 scoring against @entity99 on saturday ' there is no need to doubt me			0
i have played for the national team for 11 years and it is something different to be in favour of a referendum which is democratic			0
people should have the right to vote and this has nothing to do with the other			0
' politics have been interwoven with @entity2 almost since it was formed and is summed up by the team 's motto : ' more than a club '			2
the extent to which @entity2 has pushed the @entity116 cause has depended on the board in power , but it always plays a central role in cultural life			2
@entity36 ( left ) has played for @entity5 for 11 years but thinks the referendum should take place the current board , first under president @entity124 and now @entity125 , have taken a back - seat in the heated debate currently taking place in the region			1
but @entity2 supporters aligned with former - president @entity131 are calling on the club to be more vocal in support of the referendum			2
@entity2 are top of @entity3 after an unbeaten start to the season and beat @entity99 2 - 0 on saturday @entity131 , who was president from 2003 to 2010 , wanted the club to be at the forefront of @entity116 politics , which angered many fans , particularly those from other parts of @entity5 who felt alienated			1
a @entity2 spokesman was non-committal and said : ' it is a sensitive subject and the club wo n't get involved but the president is considering making a statement in the coming days			0
