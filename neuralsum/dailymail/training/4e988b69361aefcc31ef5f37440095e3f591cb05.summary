@entity0 achieved a points victory of extraordinary dimensions in @entity3 but not the first knock out in six years which he so mightily desired			1
the six knock - downs he inflicted on a road - runner in reverse called @entity8 thrilled the packed south - east @entity10 crowd in the @entity11 but were not quite enough to finish off the @entity12			1
@entity14 ’s holder of degrees in medicine and nutrition looked after his health through 12 rounds spent going backwards so fast and so far that if they had taken out the ropes he would have backed himself into the car park of the @entity25 casino			0
@entity0 dominated his fight with @entity8 from the first bell and won convincingly @entity0 was on top of @entity29 from the first bell but was unable to stop the fight early @entity32 survival is not enough in a world title fight			1
so perhaps @entity8 ’s real achievement was that of preventing the @entity35 from sending him so far into oblivion that it may have frightened @entity39 from ever agreeing to the richest fight in ring history			1
@entity35 had considered carrying @entity8 a few rounds so as not to look too devastating on television back in @entity39 ’s home town of @entity45			1
as it transpired , @entity8 did that job for him by being fit enough to run a marathon while facing the wrong way and - well , yes - brave enough to keep getting up every time @entity0 bowled him over			1
so when he was asked if him against @entity39 might finally happen , the @entity35 was able to say : ‘ yes , i want that fight and the fans deserve it			1
’ he praised @entity56 for regaining a vertical position once in the second round , twice in the sixth , twice more in the eighth and once again in the ninth			0
his fabled trainer @entity61 disagreed with that assessment , saying : ' all he did was run			0
he showed none of the guts that got him off the canvas to win his light - welter title against @entity68			2
' @entity8 was stripped of that belt the second the first bell rang here , for accepting this catch - weight fight for @entity0 ’s world welterweight title			1
where he goes from here after a performance trying to smother the life out of a major television event is anybody ’s guess			0
but @entity0 is still on course for a date with destiny and a large share of a potential one - billion dollars purse in @entity45 , @entity85 agreeing			1
even though @entity8 refused to join the party , @entity0 was able to demonstrate that his punching power is almost regenerated to the level which destroyed our own @entity89 in 2008			1
the heaviest knock down was the first of the two in the sixth			0
somehow @entity95 made it to the bell even though it could easily have been stopped then by the referee , his own corner ... or one more blow of that magnitude from @entity0			1
@entity8 hits the canvas after another pinpoint punch from @entity0 , one of six times he put the @entity12 down @entity8 sits on the canvas after being put down by @entity0 and takes the count from the referee @entity8 gets to his knee as he takes the count from the referee in @entity3 reminded that he had questioned the power of the @entity35 , he graciously conceded : ‘ he ’s a great fighter			1
’ as for himself , he did so little that i concurred with the judge who gave @entity0 every round , in addition to the knock - down deductions , on a 120 - 102 card			1
the two other judges scored it 119 - 103			1
the crowd did not care either way			0
inside the arena they squealed to the rafters every time the @entity130 idol landed			0
outside , the thousands waiting to see @entity0 roared their approval			2
and it was still lunchtime here as we all emerged into the sunshine of another @entity35 victory			0
@entity0 entered the ring to the strains of @entity141 's ‘ @entity140			1
’ once he had knelt to pray in a corner and announcer @entity143 had told us to get ready to rumble , the roars of ‘ @entity0 , @entity0 ’ filled the packed @entity11			2
then began his pursuit of the @entity12 , who was clearly intent on backpedaling behind his naturally longer jab			2
@entity149 delighted with performance @entity0 lands a devastating blow to the jaw of @entity29 in his dominant performance in @entity154 @entity8 had a reach advantage over @entity0 but was unable to make it count as he was dominated by the @entity157 @entity0 has not knocked anyone out since @entity89 back in 2008 - but he came very close against @entity8 @entity0 remains keen on huge fight with pound - for - pound king @entity39 in 2015 after this victory over @entity8 @entity8 was unable to cope with the power of @entity0 as he was outclassed @entity8 hits the canvas again as @entity0 looked to win his first fight by way of knock out since 2008 @entity0 stands back as @entity8 hits the deck during his comprehensive points win despite his five - inch height advantage , however , @entity168 was not landing with that jab and @entity0 caught up with him often enough to win the round			1
@entity8 was in full flight as @entity0 stepped up the pace , although when he found the canvas early in the second he claimed it was slip			1
but referee @entity178 ruled a knock - down			0
still the medical graduate from @entity14 ’s @entity181 had not landed a punch of note as the @entity35 took the second 10 - 8			0
@entity61 had predicted that @entity8 would run and he was being proved right			2
the @entity12 was surviving but showing no sign yet of trying to win the fight as he slipped four points behind by the end of the third round			1
@entity8 was able to land some punches - but not enough to put @entity190 in any danger of losing the fight @entity0 takes a shot from @entity29 on the chin but did not come close to losing the fight @entity8 was blocking a proportion of @entity0 ’s punches but , despite his height , was mostly out of reach the few he threw himself			1
he was also beginning to look even more apprehensive as one or two heavier shots landed			0
it takes two to tango and @entity168 did take a couple of tentative steps forward at the start of the fifth			0
but once he was hit by a left he went on the retreat again , covering up and crouching whenever @entity0 cut off his space			2
one punch he did get through with was low			0
he was warned for that and for wrestling			0
@entity8 was using his right hand almost exclusively to protect himself against @entity0 ’s deadly left hook			1
but the first big one got through and down he went again			0
a third knock - down followed , this time from a wicked right straight through the middle of his guard but he survived the round			0
@entity0 is congratulated by his team after the final bell after beating @entity8 on points @entity0 celebrates his victory over @entity29 in @entity3 after a dominant points win @entity8 is the ring ’s self - nutritionist and was certainly a fit enough athlete			1
but you ca n’t escape everything the @entity35 throws and he was rocked by a crisp right as even the faintest chance of winning on points disappeared completely			0
as well as going into reverse , @entity8 bought more time by complaining about imagined illegalities			2
the referee was having none of it but , @entity0 , ever the gentleman , kept giving him a few seconds to recover , en route to winning yet another round			2
what was becoming a tedious exercise in frustration exploded with a trade - mark left from @entity0 which put @entity8 flat on his back			1
he staggered back to his feet only to be floored again			0
arguably it should have been stopped as @entity0 went for the kill but the reeling challenger made it to the final bell			2
@entity8 sits down at the end of the fifth round while one of the ring girls holds a board for the upcoming sixth round @entity12 actor @entity256 takes photographs during the fight at the @entity25 in @entity3 @entity259 was also ringside to watch @entity0 beat @entity8 on points @entity8 ’s corner sent their man back out to take more punishment			1
he was fighting – or rather not really fighting – in a fog now and down he went again from another of those lefts			0
despite his total dominance , time was running out for @entity0 to deliver the first knock out in the six years since he demolished @entity89 – and which he was desperate to give his south east @entity10 fans			2
blows which would have finished anyone who came to fight were just about ridden by @entity8 as bac - pedaled			1
and so towards the finishing tape which @entity8 was so anxious to reach – even though he was losing by as enormous a margin as there has ever been in boxing			2
survive he did – but at a cost to his own reputation			0
the delusional state of @entity281 is revealed by quotes from his old kick - boxing now world - title - boxing trainer , @entity285 , overheard in the corner between rounds : end of round three , after first knock downs : ‘ you ’re doing beautiful man			0
’ end of round 3 , after first knock downs : ‘ you ’re doing beautiful man			0
’ end of round seven , following another knock - down : ‘ this is where we want to be			0
’ during round nine , seconds before the heaviest knock down : ‘ @entity8 is going to put him to sleep in a few minutes			1
’ end of round nine : ‘ we are exactly where we need to be			0
’ ( presumably flat on his back			0
) end of round 10 : ‘ @entity8 , i ’m letting you out of the cage			2
’ end of round 11 , at 17 points behind with one round to go : ‘ hit him in the body and stay on his ass			0

@entity0 beat @entity8 on points 119 - 103 , 119 - 103 , 120 - 102
@entity0 put his @entity12 *opponent* on the floor six times in the fight
@entity0 hopes to finally meet @entity39 in the ring in 2015
