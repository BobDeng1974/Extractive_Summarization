president @entity0 pleaded quietly for calm in @entity2 , @entity3 on monday night , speaking from the @entity4 as rioters overtook streets in the @entity8 suburb and cable tv broadcasts showed them setting fires and attacking police cars			1
after members of a grand jury determined that police officer @entity15 will not face criminal charges related to the death of 18 - year - old @entity18 on august 9 , peaceful protests spiraled out of control			1
@entity0 spoke to the nation a half - hour later			2
the president said anger is an ' understandable reaction ' from people who believe ' the law is being applied in a discriminatory fashion , ' a reference to @entity15 being white and @entity18 being black			1
' what we need to do is try to understand them , ' @entity0 said			2
that wo n't be done by using this as an excuse to vandalize property			1
it certainly wo n't be done by hurting anybody			1
' ' there is no excuse for violence , ' he said			0
' those who are only interested in violence and just want the problem to go away should realize that we have work to do here			0
' as the president spoke , cable news channels broadcast split - screen views of an imperturbable @entity0 on one side and angry reactions on the other			1
in one shot , dozens of protesters were seen trying to overturn a squad car not far from police headquarters			2
@entity69 dispersed only when tear gas canisters erupted			0
contrast : ' no drama @entity0 ' pleaded for calm while riots erupted in @entity2 calm : the taciturn president told the nation that violence wo n't solve problems , while split - screens showed the streets of @entity2 exploding into pandemonium study in contrast : ' no drama @entity0 ' pleaded for calm while riots erupted in @entity2 meanwhile : as @entity0 spoke , protesters began gathering outside the @entity4 to denounce ' racist police terror protests spreading : hundreds of demonstrators , many of them @entity93 students , march down the middle of @entity95 in @entity96 @entity97 : a protester shouts slogans during clashes with riot police in @entity2 city on fire : a police car burns outside the @entity104 on monday night rioting : police take cover during clashes with protesters in @entity2 , @entity3 @entity109 : more than 150 gunshots have been reported overnight , shops were looted and several buildings were set on fire in @entity2 in another , rioters threw rocks and bottles and set fires as @entity0 counseled ' care and restraint in managing peaceful protests that occur			1
' police ' need to work with the community , not against the community , ' he said , indicating his desire to see law enforcement isolate violent instigators – many of whom traveled to @entity3 from great distances – and a larger group of people ' who want to protest peacefully			2
' ' the fact is , ' he said , ' in too many parts of this country a deep distrust exists between law enforcement and communities of color			0
some of this is the result of the legacy of racial discrimination in this country			0
' ' and this is tragic because nobody needs good policing more than poor communities with higher crime rates			0
we need to recognize that this is not just an issue for @entity2 , this is an issue for @entity155			2
' @entity0 delivered his nine - minute statement , answered a single question and then left the @entity4 briefing room as journalists asked whether brown will face separate federal charges related to alleged civil - rights violations			1
the @entity3 grand jury 's decision is n't binding on the @entity165 in @entity96 , where outgoing attorney general @entity166 still could charge him			1
it 's possible that @entity15 could still face a federal trial and a long prison sentence			1
that would still be the case even if he had been acquitted in a state - level court			0
a group of protesters vandalize a police vehicle after the announcement of the grand jury decision looters : this store is the same one @entity18 allegedly robbed before the clash with police that resulted in his death on august 9 a suspected looter is apprehended outside a @entity185 in @entity2 , @entity3 a firetruck passes a group of police wearing riot gear as the protests spread across @entity2 and the @entity155 a group of protesters confront a black police officer on the streets of @entity2 on monday night a female protester covers her face in milk to counteract being pepper sprayed by police after a group of demonstrators attempted to stop traffic on @entity203 ' we need to accept that this decision was the grand jury 's to make ' : @entity0 counseled acceptance of the outcome in @entity3 , even as his @entity165 could lodge federal charges in the case @entity3 @entity212 sen. @entity211 hinted at a second bite at the apple for the government in a statement issued after the news broke , saying @entity218 should ' await the conclusion of ... [ an ] independent investigation ' being undertaken by the @entity165 before passing judgment			1
but on monday the president firmly legitimized the 12 citizens , nine white and three black , who heard evidence over a stretch of weeks and decided it did n't add up to an indictment			1
' first and foremost , we are a nation built on the rule of law , and so we need to accept that this decision was the grand jury 's to make , ' @entity0 said			1
' there are @entity155 who agree with it , and there are @entity155 who are deeply upset , even angry			0
it 's an understandable reaction			0
but i join @entity18 's parents in asking anyone who protests this decision to do so peacefully			0
' @entity0 has not said whether he , like his attorney general , would personally visit @entity2			2
he left that possibility open on monday			0
' let 's take a look and see how things are going , ' he said in response to the one question he took			0
' @entity166 's been there			0
we 've had a whole team from the @entity165 there			0
and i think that they have done some very good work			0
' the grand jury process is different from a courtroom trial			2
it 's conducted in secret and without balance between the government and a potential defendant			0
unlike in a trial , where a jury must assign guilt beyond a reasonable doubt , the grand jury must only decide whether or not there 's a rational reason – a ' probable cause – to believe that a crime was committed and sufficient evidence to bring the case to court			1
despite taking place in that far more prosecution - friendly environment , the grand jury 's determination means that the weight of the prosecution 's case was too weak to sustain charges .			1

television split - screen broadcasts showed dramatic contrast between the president 's requests for *nonviolent* reactions and the fires set on the streets of @entity2 , @entity3
dispelling black activists ' distrust for police ' wo n't be done by smashing car windows , ' @entity0 said , as cable news screens showed windows being smashed and reporters warned of shots fired
rioters threw bottles and rocks at police after grand jury members decided they could n't charge officer @entity15 with a crime
@entity0 left the press briefing room after a nine - minute statement when reporters began asking him whether @entity15 will face separate federal civil - rights charges
