six lions at @entity1 have been put down , triggering outrage among staff who claim there was no obvious reason for the animals to be killed			1
an adult male called @entity8 , a lioness named @entity10 and four of her cubs were all put to death last month in an operation supervised by vets			1
bosses at the safari park on the @entity20 ’s @entity19 estate insist the decision was taken because of ‘ health risks ’ after a population increase led to violent behaviour			1
at play : lions and cubs , left , from the pride that was culled by vets at @entity29 , pictured three weeks but former workers in the lion reserve have questioned whether the animals should have been destroyed , and revealed that some employees were in tears when they found out what had happened			1
the lions are one of the biggest attractions at @entity29 , which opened in 1966 as @entity40 ’s first wildlife safari park			1
less than three weeks ago , members of the famous @entity29 pride were photographed playing happily in the park , with one leaping 30ft from an oak tree , landing on all fours with a precision which astonished onlookers			2
a whistleblower told @entity49 that the lions were injected with a lethal substance from a tranquiliser gun			1
former workers in the lion reserve have questioned whether the animals should have been destroyed visitors were offered no explanation for the lions ’ absence yesterday when the park reopened after the long winter break			1
@entity10 arrived in 2011 from her previous home at @entity62 at @entity63 in @entity64			1
she soon became part of a new pride and a mother to a litter of cubs – as well as a close companion of another first - time mother , @entity71			1
a keeper caring for the new arrivals spoke at the time of how the pair enjoyed rough and tumble games with their cubs – who weighed just two pounds at birth – and seemed very protective of their offspring			1
a @entity62 spokesman said yesterday : ‘ we have been told nothing			0
apart from health problems , i ca n’t think of any other reason why a lion like @entity10 would have to be put down			1
we will be contacting @entity29 for more information			0
’ one of the world ’s leading big cat experts , consultant vet @entity91 , said he was baffled			0
‘ on the face of it this seems like an odd thing to do			0
@entity29 would not take such a decision lightly because they know how much it would upset their keepers			0
’ @entity100 - based mr @entity91 , whose career has included consultancy work with the @entity103 and the @entity104 , said : ‘ this could be part of a conservation programme			0
it is a debatable reason for putting down a lioness and her cubs but until all the details emerge it is difficult to understand their thinking			1
‘ most zoos have a contraceptive programme in place and manage to control populations perfectly well			0
‘ that ’s why this seems a bit odd , in a way			0
it ’s just not a problem that most zoos experience			0
it does seem such a shame that so many young animals have been involved			2
’ another big cat expert , @entity131 of the @entity132 , said zoos did need to restrict breeding			0
‘ @entity135 take up space and zoos do n’t always want them , ’ he said			0
‘ putting the animal down is not a welfare issue as long as it is done properly			0
’ stately home : the grounds of @entity29 , pictured , host one of @entity40 's leading wildlife collections according to the whistleblower , @entity8 was put down in early january			1
the former employee said : ‘ i do n’t think there was a reason to do it			0
he had been vasectomised so he could n’t breed			0
@entity8 could have been sold to another zoo			1
‘ it all happened while the park was closed for the winter so no one knew what was going on			0
a lot of people who know what happened are very upset and angry			0
’ a @entity29 spokesman said last night : ‘ there has been a large increase in pregnancies among the lions , resulting in a 40 per cent increase in population			2
this has resulted in excessive violent behaviour , putting 21 of them at risk			2
‘ sadly one lion , @entity8 , had to be put down earlier this year due to injuries from an attack within the enclosure			1
the further lions referred to were put down due to associated and severe health risks			2
‘ a further five lions from this enclosure will be moved to other premises			2
@entity29 takes the utmost care in trying to protect the welfare and safety of all its animals .			2
