an @entity1 history teacher faces losing his job for having a @entity4 poster with a controversial quote based on ' choosing a mistress ' on the wall of his classroom			1
@entity10 , 62 , who has taught for 38 years , was suspended from @entity11 last week for having a picture of a cat alongside the phrase : ' in the dark , all cats are grey			1
' it is paraphrasing a letter the @entity18 wrote to a friend in 1745 called ' advice to a @entity21 on choosing a mistress ' - urging a man he should chose an older woman companion			1
@entity10 was suspended from @entity11 in @entity1 last week for having a picture of a cat alongside the phrase ' in the dark , all cats are grey ' in the classroom			1
it is a quote from a letter by @entity34 ( right ) , written in 1745 , advising a young man that he should choose an older mistress in the passage , the politician writes : ' it is impossible of two women to know an old from a young one			1
and as in the dark all @entity45 are grey , the pleasure of corporal enjoyment with an old woman is at least equal , and frequently superior			1
' in the 19th century it was deemed obscene and was not originally published in his original letters			1
@entity10 , a @entity50 reenactor , has been working at the school for six years and it is believed he had the poster up since he started			1
@entity54 , the teacher 's attorney , told the @entity56 : ' my client was teaching history accurately			1
' just as @entity34 was a great man in terms of science and a founder of our nation , he was still a man			1
people need to know these things , not just the myths and legends , but who they are			2
' we hope that cooler heads will prevail , ' he added			2
' there is still time for the school board to do nothing			2
if they do make a recommendation , we are looking forward to a full and fair hearing before the school board			1
' career : the 62 - year - old , who has been a teacher for almost 40 years , is believed to have had the poster in the classroom since he started at @entity11 six years ago @entity10 told the paper that he wanted to resolve the issue as quickly as possible and get back into the classroom			1
a @entity87 group supporting his re-instatement has already reached 302 members and his wife @entity90 has also posted her support			0
former student @entity92 told @entity93 4 she never thought the quote was a big deal and thinks @entity10 's suspension is unfair			1
' i think it`s awful , why would you want to do that to someone who has been so loyal to their school , who came to every single football game ? ' i hope that he gets to keep his job			2
i hope that he gets more respect out of this because he deserves it			0
he`s a good man , he 's a good teacher			1
however @entity110 , who works in a bait shop in the city , admitted he could see where the school is coming from			2
decision : @entity10 's disciplinary hearing at the school is set for january 20 when he will hear his fate			1
he says he hopes the issue will be resolved quickly so he can go back to work ' nowadays everything`s really touchy on subjects like that			0
suspended ? i can see it , ' @entity110 said			2
the letter is taught in schools today because it was used in the 20th century to overturn @entity127 obscenity laws			1
it was n't the only letter of @entity34 's to be censored in the @entity127			1
his satirical piece ' @entity132 ' was excluded from the majority of his published works			2
attorneys used it to prove that if it had been mailed or published , one of the country 's @entity138 would have been prosecuted			1
education officials from @entity142 declined comment on @entity10 's case because it is a personnel issue and a pending legal matter			1
according to the @entity147 , @entity10 's disciplinary hearing has been set for january 20			1
the public school board is set to have already discussed the matter but have not released any details			1
explicit content : the controversial correspondance written by the @entity18 was considered to be obscene and was not published in his collection of letters my dear friend , i know of no medicine fit to diminish the violent natural @entity159 you mention ; and if i did , i think i should not communicate it to you			1
marriage is the proper remedy			0
it is the most natural state of man , and therefore the @entity165 in which you are most likely to find solid happiness			2
your reasons against entering into it at present , appear to me not well - founded			2
the circumstantial advantages you have in @entity171 by postponing it , are not only uncertain , but they are small in comparison with that of the thing itself , the being married and settled			0
it is the @entity179 united that make the compleat human being			0
separate , she wants his @entity183 ; he , her @entity185 , @entity186 and acute discernment			0
together they are more likely to succeed in the @entity188			0
a single man has not nearly the value he would have in that @entity191			2
he is an incomplete animal			0
he resembles the odd half of a pair of @entity195			0
if you get a prudent healthy wife , your @entity198 in your profession , with her good economy , will be a @entity202 sufficient			0
but if you will not take this counsel , and persist in thinking a @entity205 with the @entity206 inevitable , then i repeat my former advice , that in all your @entity208 you should prefer old women to young ones			2
you call this a @entity212 , and demand my reasons			0
they are these : i. because as they have more @entity218 and their minds are better stor 'd with observations , their conversation is more improving and more lastingly agreable			0
because when women cease to be handsome , they study to be good			0
to maintain their influence over men , they supply the @entity226			0
they learn to do a 1000 services small and great , and are the most tender and useful of all friends when you are sick			0
and hence there is hardly such a thing to be found as an old woman who is not a good woman			2
because there is no hazard of @entity239 , which irregularly produc 'd may be attended with much @entity240			0
because thro ' more experience , they are more prudent and discreet in conducting an @entity243 to prevent @entity244			0
the commerce with them is therefore safer with regard to your reputation			0
and with regard to theirs , if the @entity208 should happen to be known , considerate people might be rather inclin 'd to excuse an old woman who would kindly take care of a young man , form his @entity255 by her good @entity256 , and prevent his ruining his @entity258 and @entity202 among mercenary prostitutes			1
because in every animal that walks upright , the deficiency of the fluids that fill the @entity262 appears first in the highest part : the face first grows lank and wrinkled ; then the @entity265 ; then the @entity266 ; the lower parts continuing to the last as plump as ever : so that covering all above with a basket , and regarding2 only what is below the @entity272 , it is impossible of two women to know an old from a young one			0
and as in the dark all @entity45 are grey , the pleasure of corporal enjoyment with an old woman is at least equal , and frequently superior , every @entity278 being by practice capable of @entity280			1
because the @entity281 is less			0
the debauching a @entity282 may be her ruin , and make her for life unhappy			0
because the @entity286 is less			0
the having made a young girl miserable may give you frequent bitter reflections ; none of which can attend the making an old woman happy			2
8thly and lastly they are so grateful ! ! thus much for my @entity212			0
but still i advise you to marry directly ; being sincerely your affectionate friend			0
