by @entity0 for @entity1 it sounds like an excuse a flustered groom might make after forgetting to order the wedding cake			2
but newlyweds @entity6 , 35 , and @entity8 , 32 , had to make do with a consolation cake from a nearby supermarket after a dog ate theirs			1
when they arrived at the marquee for their wedding reception at @entity18 , @entity19 , they found their beautiful red velvet cake had been demolished			1
the red velvet wedding cake had been lovingly made by the bride 's grandfather , @entity22 newlyweds @entity6 , 35 , and @entity8 , 32 , had to make do with a consolation cake after a dog ate theirs it had been lovingly made by the bride 's grandfather , @entity22			1
initially the couple , who were together for five years before tying the knot at @entity33 , thought it had been damaged in transit			0
but a trail of muddy paw prints across the dance floor alerted the couple that there could have been a canine thief			1
caterers then told the couple that they had had to shoo animals away from the tent earlier on in the day			0
mr @entity8 said : ' it was quite upsetting - we just could n't understand what had happened			0
' when @entity22 showed us , i just thought it had n't travelled well			2
the couple married at @entity33 and held their reception at @entity18 , @entity19 ' when he told me it had , we noticed the muddy paw prints on our dance floor and knew something had got it			1
' then we saw the dog hairs all over the remaining half and it was quite clear			2
' it did n't ruin our big day but we were gutted , as was @entity22			0
' there was probably someone who saw their pet with its face covered in icing and chocolate so they probably knows which dog it is			0
' @entity8 's mum pointed out that the cake would probably not have agreed with the canine thief			2
' the couple are not sure exactly which dog ate the cake , as the thief had already disappeared			0
but one of mr @entity8 's friends said he had seen a black @entity79 sniffing around			1
