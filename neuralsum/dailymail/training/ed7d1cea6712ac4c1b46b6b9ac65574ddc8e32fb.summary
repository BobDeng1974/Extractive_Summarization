by @entity1 reporter published : 09:05 est , 3 october 2012 updated : 09:14 est , 3 october 2012 a girl battling cancer has been fitted with metal bones which will grow as she does			1
@entity5 , 8 , from @entity6 , @entity7 , was diagnosed with a bone cancer tumour called osteosarcoma in february after she came home from school limping just weeks earlier			1
the tumour , on her right leg , meant that her entire knee , tibia and part of her femur had to be removed and rebuilt with stainless steel adjustable bones			1
as @entity5 grows , a magnet will be placed around her leg which will allow doctors to lengthen the bones in her shin and thigh as required			1
@entity5 holds an x-ray of her leg , which shows her new metal bones that will grow with her over the next six years her mother @entity28 , 30 , said : ' @entity5 came home after school one day with a sore ankle			1
she had been doing cross-country and was limping			2
we thought nothing of it and imagined she had just sprained it while she had been out running			0
' but after a couple of weeks , the pain had travelled up her leg and did n’t seem to be going anywhere so i took her to the doctors			2
' i thought they were just going to strap her up and send her home again - we never thought it would ever be anything serious			2
' but @entity28 and @entity5 ’s father @entity45 were in for the shock of their lives after doctors sent @entity5 for an x-ray , which revealed she had a tumour on the bone above her right knee			1
@entity45 , 40 , said : ' they did an x-ray of her ankle and then called us back so they could do another on her hips			2
' we were told to wait five days and assumed this meant there was nothing serious going on or they would have done something straight away			0
' but the hospital called us a few days later and told us we had to take @entity5 out of school and get her there			1
' that ’s when we started to worry			0
i could sense the urgency over the phone and i could n’t possibly have expected what they were going to tell us			0
' @entity5 will undergo another six months of chemotherapy to ensure all cancerous cells have been destroyed surgeons at @entity79 ’s @entity78 performed a biopsy on @entity5 ’s tumour and found it to be cancerous			1
@entity28 , a former florist said : ' it sounds stupid to say now but until we were told @entity5 had cancer , i did n’t think children got cancer			1
' i ’d heard of children with leukaemia but for some reason i did n’t think of them as the same thing			0
' once @entity28 and @entity45 had been told of @entity5 ’s cancer , doctors sat the youngster down and explained to her what was wrong with her			1
@entity5 said : ' they told me i had cancer but i did n’t know what it meant			1
i ’d heard people talking about it but i did n’t know what it was			0
' @entity28 said : ' when we were told @entity5 had the disease , i think my heart stopped for a second			1
my little girl had cancer			0
no parent should have to hear that			0
' i thought she was going to die			0
we asked doctors if she was going to be ok but it was a question they could n’t answer - they just looked at us sympathetically			0
' just a week after her diagnosis in february , medics began @entity5 on a course of chemotherapy and performed a 14 - hour operation on the youngster to remove her knee and tibia bones			1
they then replaced them using adjustable stainless steel to act like real bones			1
xray of @entity5 's leg : as @entity5 grows , a magnet will be placed around her leg which will allow doctors to lengthen the bones in her shin and thigh @entity45 , a former mechanic , said : ' @entity5 was so poorly			1
the chemotherapy hit her hard , she was sick a lot and had very little energy			0
' her hair began to fall out which i think was hard for her - but now we ca n’t imagine her ever having any ! ' she also contracted pneumonia - a strain which doctors said was the worst they had seen , after her lung collapsed			0
' the operation was the hardest part			0
we did n’t think it would take that long so it was a waiting game for her to come out of theatre			0
the longer she was down there , the more we thought was going wrong			0
' but the operation was a success and after installing @entity5 ’s new limbs , surgeons managed to reconstruct all of the muscles , tendons and even blood vessels around the new bones			2
as the new metal bones were too big for her leg when they were fitted , skin and tissue from her left thigh was used to stretch around her newly built limb			2
now that the cancerous tissue has been removed , @entity5 is well on the road to recovery			2
she will still need up to six months worth of chemotherapy to ensure all cancerous cells have been destroyed before she can be given the all - clear			0
@entity5 ’s new bones will last until she is 14 , when they will be replaced with adult sized metal pieces , which will be left inside her leg for the rest of her life			1
in the meantime , her sisters @entity176 , 5 , and @entity177 , 2 , are pleased to have her home where they can help look after her with their parents , who both gave up their jobs to be @entity5 ’s full - time carers			1
the brave youngster has recently been nominated for a champion @entity185 , after she made hundreds of friendship bracelets while she was in hospital to raise money for charity			0
her mother said : ' she ’s doing really well , she is better than she used to be			0
' it will be a while before @entity5 can walk independently as she has to build up the muscles again in her legs but she is doing brilliantly - we are all so proud of her			2

@entity5 had a sore ankle , which her parents put down to a school cross-country run
when she did *n't* improve her doctor sent her for an x-ray , when her parents were told she had a bone cancer tumour in her leg
eight - year - old had to have knee , tibia and part of her femur removed and replaced with adjustable stainless steel bones
