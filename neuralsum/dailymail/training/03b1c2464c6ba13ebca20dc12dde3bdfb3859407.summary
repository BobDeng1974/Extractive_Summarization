a @entity2 diet increases life expectancy by protecting the dna from damage , research shows			1
@entity7 academics studied 4,676 middle - aged women comparing their typical eating habits with the make - up of their cells			0
importantly , they looked at their telomeres – biological caps which are found at the ends of chromosomes that protect the dna inside			1
the @entity2 diet is rich in fruits , vegetables , pulses , whole grains , fish and olive oil with little red or processed meat - and may help protect our dna from damage , new research suggests as we get older , our telomeres get progressively shorter , causing the dna to become damaged and raising the odds of age - related illnesses such as @entity30 ' s , diabetes and heart disease			1
the research – published in the @entity34 – found that women whose diets were generally low in fat and high in fruit and veg had longer telomeres			1
but this was even more pronounced for those who followed a @entity2 diet rich in fruit , veg , nuts and pulses			1
@entity50 , the lead author from the @entity51 in @entity52 , the @entity49 , said that it may be due to antioxidants in fruit , veg and nuts – chemicals that prevent ill health and aging			0
she said : ' our findings showed that healthy eating , overall , was associated with longer telomeres			2
' however , the strongest association was observed among women who adhered to the @entity2 diet			2
' dr @entity64 , associate professor at the @entity65 said : ' our results further support the benefits of adherence to this diet to promote health and longevity			0
' to our knowledge this is the largest population - based study specifically addressing the association between @entity2 diet adherence and telomere length in healthy , middle - aged women , women whose diets were low in fat and high in fruit and veg had longer telomeres - biological caps on chromosomes that protect the dna inside ' our results further support the benefits of adherence to this diet to promote health and longevity			1
' previous research by @entity7 last year involving 10,000 showed that women who followed a @entity2 diet were 40 per cent to live beyond the age of 70			1
they were also far less likely to develop chronic diseases including diabetes , heart disease , @entity30 's or parkinson 's disease			0
the @entity2 diet is rich in fruits , vegetables , pulses , whole grains , fish and olive oil with little red or processed meat			1
dr @entity104 , associate medical director at the @entity105 , said : ' this large study adds to the body of evidence that longer telomeres are found in those who eat a @entity2 diet			1
' longer telomeres may partially explain the link between diet and risk of cardiovascular disease			2
' previous findings from the same study had shown that those with unhealthy lifestyles had shorter telomeres			0
' these results reinforce our advice that eating a balanced and healthy diet can reduce your risk of developing heart disease			0
' the @entity2 diet not only improves heart health but it could help male impotence			1
researchers found men with erectile dysfunction who adopted the diet - involving eating fruit , veg , pasta , olive oil and nuts daily but few dairy products or red meat - may reduce their chances of having a heart attack or stroke			1
however , patients with erectile dysfunction who failed to stick to the @entity2 diet had more vascular and cardiac damage			2
@entity148 doctor @entity147 , who presented his findings at the annual meeting of the @entity151 in @entity152 , said : ' erectile dysfunction is not a symptom of ageing , it is a bad sign from the body that something is wrong with the vasculature			0
men men with erectile dysfunction who adopted the diet - involving eating fruit , veg , pasta , olive oil and nuts daily but few dairy products or red meat - may reduce their chances of having a heart attack or stroke ' in 80 per cent of cases , erectile dysfunction is caused by vascular problems and is a warning that patients are at increased risk of a heart attack or stroke			1
' he added : ' the @entity2 diet is associated with lower cardiovascular events and could be a way to help erectile dysfunction patients lower their risk			2
' we wanted to investigate whether patients with erectile dysfunction who follow this diet have less vascular and cardiac damage			0
' the study included 75 men with erectile dysfunction , average age 56 , who attended the @entity192 at @entity193 in @entity194			0
dr @entity147 said : ' patients with erectile dysfunction who had unhealthy diets had more vascular and cardiac damage than those who followed the @entity2 diet			2
good sources of monounsaturated fat - such as macadamia nuts - can help men with erectile dysfunction avoid a heart attack ' previous studies have shown that patients with erectile dysfunction have vascular damage , but we found that the heart is also damaged			1
' this may help to further explain why these patients are more prone to cardiovascular events			0
' the formation of atheroma , the stiffening of the arteries , and the poor functioning of the heart can eventually lead to a cardiac event			0
' he added : ' our findings suggest that adopting the @entity2 diet can improve the cardiovascular risk profile of patients with erectile dysfunction and may reduce their chances of having a heart attack or stroke			1
this needs to be tested in a larger study			0
' really simple changes in our diet may help a lot , for example using olive oil which contains monounsaturated fat			2
' if someone does n't have the money to buy some of the foods they can substitute them with others , for example nuts are a good source of monounsaturated fat			0
' sometimes it 's difficult to adopt something if you consider that it 's part of a prescription , but the @entity2 diet is not a prescription , it 's a lifestyle			2
' it 's about having an awareness of what foods are healthy or unhealthy			0
' he concluded : ' patients who have erectile dysfunction and do n't adhere to the @entity2 diet have vascular and cardiac damage and are at increased risk of heart attack and stroke			1
' our findings suggest that adopting a healthy diet can reduce that risk			0
we also advise patients to stop smoking , exercise and ensure that they have healthy levels of blood pressure and lipids			0

the diet is rich in fruits , vegetables , pulses , whole grains , fish and olive oil
with age , our telomeres - biological caps which are found at the ends of chromosomes that protect the dna inside - become shorter
but women who ate a @entity2 diet had longer telomeres
these foods can also help men with impotence avoid a heart attack
