new revelations : @entity3 whistleblower @entity2 speaking in october - the former defense contractor has revealed that @entity7 intelligence operatives operated online in @entity12 and @entity16 to try and catch terrorists the @entity47 has reported that @entity48 , the @entity8 counterpart of the @entity3 even sent operatives into @entity16 in 2008 and infiltrated a criminal ring that was selling stolen credit card information in that virtual world			1
the @entity2 files reveal that the real - life sting in a virtual world was named @entity57 and was helped by a recruited online informer who ' helpfully volunteered on the target group 's latest activities			1
' citing the documents disclosed by @entity2 , the report also says agencies ' have built mass - collection capabilities ' against @entity67 's @entity66 online network			2
important details — such as how much data was gathered , or how many players ' information was compromised — were not clear , the reports said			0
@entity73 , the producer of @entity12 , told the @entity47 : ‘ we are unaware of any surveillance taking place			0
if it was , it would have been done without our knowledge or permission			0
’ online games such as @entity12 and @entity16 are huge business as players adopt avatars of different people or indeed , orcs , goblins and elves			2
@entity3 hq : reports say @entity8 and @entity7 intelligence officers have been spying on gamers across the world , deploying undercover officers to virtual universes and sucking up traffic from popular online games such as @entity12 the 2008 @entity3 report claims that if the intelligence garnered from the spying on these online games was used correctly , then pictures of ordinary citizen 's and potential terrorist social networks could be built up			1

' @entity16 especially intruiged the @entity3 and @entity114 , because of its plans to introduce voice calls and anonymous texts - that terrorists could utilize			2

' indeed , so rife was the spying online of @entity16 by the @entity147 , @entity148 , and the @entity149 that a memo was sent to try and ' deconflict ' their work - i.e. make sure that they were n't treading on each other 's toes			0
