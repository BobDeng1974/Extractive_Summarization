by @entity0 published : 13:33 est , 24 september 2012 updated : 03:32 est , 25 september 2012 @entity1 has denied a bug on its site is causing private messages to be displayed on people 's walls			1
online users have claimed private messages written in 2009 and earlier were today showing up on viewable timelines as messages ' posted by friends '			1
the reports were mainly in the @entity13 and @entity14 , and only appeared to affect some users			0
@entity1 ceo @entity16 was at the centre of a major privacy row today as internet users claimed that private messages were being displayed as public			1
however , the site said the issue was simply a mistake by users			1
@entity1 acknowledged the problem had been raised by users , but denied there was a problem , saying it has ' extensively investigated ' them			1
' a small number of users raised concerns after what they believed to be private messages appeared on their timeline			2
' our engineers investigated these reports and found that the messages were older wall posts that had always been visible on the users ' profile pages			1
' @entity1 is satisfied that there has been no breach of user privacy			1
' the concerns come as @entity1 is looking to tackle @entity46 by making search a much more prominent part of its social network			2
@entity16 said : ' @entity1 is pretty uniquely positioned to answer the questions people have ' - and plans to build more powerful search facilities as @entity1 evolves			2
the social network is already tweaking its search capabilities - with any search a user makes in the top bar now stored and displayed by @entity1			2
@entity1 said it will now log all searches made in @entity1 , which users can then see by clicking on the @entity61 button			1
the company stressed that any searches you make will not be visible to other users			0
however the move may spark privacy concerns about what data the website giant keeps on users , and how they will use that data in order to prove search functionality			0
in a statement , the company said : ' in addition to your other activity , you 'll be able to see the searches you 're making on @entity1			0
' just as you can choose to delete any of your posts , you can use the same inline control on @entity61 to remove any of your searches at any time			0
' @entity1 added : ' it 's important to remember that no one else can see your @entity61 , including your search activity			0
' you can expect to see your @entity61 updated with your search activity over the next few weeks			0
' you can access this tool by going to the top of your profile , and going to search from the activity sorter			0

internet *awash* with *rumours* of *massive* privacy bug
@entity1 claims messages are simply older , public messages users had *forgotten* about
