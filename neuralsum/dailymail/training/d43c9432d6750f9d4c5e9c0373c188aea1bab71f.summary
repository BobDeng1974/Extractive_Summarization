by @entity0 published : 12:10 est , 8 january 2014 updated : 15:00 est , 8 january 2014 @entity3 writer @entity2 famously once said ' music is the shorthand of emotion ' , and with this in mind a @entity8 artist has created a musical composition using just her brain waves			1
called @entity14 , which is @entity15 for ‘ beautiful thought ’ , @entity13 was able to translate how her brain reacted to feelings of sadness , anger and desire directly into musical notes			1
by training her brain to control these emotions , @entity23 was then able to perform her musical score simply by thinking about it			0
@entity33 then translated the brain waves into sounds and each of the different sounds were assigned to one of five speakers the @entity29 headset @entity23 used to record her brain activity is called @entity41			1
@entity23 transmitted the brainwave data from the @entity41 via @entity31 to her computer			0
@entity33 then translated the waves into sounds and each of the different sounds were assigned to one of five speakers placed beneath trays of water			1
each of the speakers were assigned a different emotion , including anger , hate , desire , sadness and happiness			1
@entity57 trained for a month by thinking of people and situations that made her feel these different emotions			0
@entity23 additionally moved her eyes towards the trays of water associated with the emotion she was feeling			2
the @entity29 headset @entity23 used to record her brain activity is called @entity41 and is created by @entity71 - based neurology experts @entity72			1
it is traditionally used to measures brainwave signals in students to monitor their attention levels during maths , memory and pattern recognition tests			0
@entity23 transmitted the brainwave data from the @entity41 via @entity31 to her computer			0
@entity33 then translated the waves into sounds and each of the different sounds were assigned to a set of five speakers placed beneath trays of water			1
this meant @entity23 , and her audience , could see exactly which speaker was playing the sound based on the jumping water droplets			1
@entity94 from @entity23 on @entity95			2
the @entity29 headset used to record @entity13 's brain activity is called @entity41 and was connected to programming software , pictured			1
the different coloured lines represent brain activity from different areas of the brain each of the speakers were assigned a different emotion , including anger , hate , desire , sadness and happiness , as shown in this diagram each of the speakers were assigned a different emotion , including anger , hate , desire , sadness and happiness			1
@entity23 additionally moved her eyes towards the trays of water associated with the emotion she was feeling			2
the artist trained for a month by thinking of people and situations that made her feel these different emotions			0
the movement of the water gave a visual representation of the speed , volume and pitch of the sound , and as brain activity and emotional intensity changed , so did the movement of the droplets			1
the aim of her work is ‘ to use technology to engage and evoke human emotion rather than alienation and create art that empowers the public through awareness of them			0
’ for the @entity14 project , @entity57 told @entity147 magazine the goal of the piece was ' to exercise control over her own mind , to make her mind so still and so calm that there ’s nothing for the @entity29 sensor to read			2
' @entity57 was hoping that by calming her thoughts she could silence the speakers , and stop the water from moving			0
she admitted that this was achievable when she was on her own , but performing made her nervous , which affected her inner calm			0
she has previously used heart rate sensors to track how different emotions affect her body			0
the movement of the water above each speaker gave a visual representation of the speed , volume and pitch of the sound			2
as brain activity and emotional intensity changed , so did the movement of the droplets			0
this meant @entity23 , and her audience , could see exactly which speaker was playing the sound			0

*performance* piece is called @entity94 , which is @entity15 for ' beautiful thought '
artist @entity13 used an @entity29 headset to record her brain waves
these brain waves were translated to sound waves using audio software
water was placed on speakers that *rippled* in time with these sound waves
each speaker was assigned an emotion , including anger , hate , desire , sadness and happiness
