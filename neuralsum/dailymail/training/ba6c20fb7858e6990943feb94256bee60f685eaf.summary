by @entity0 a father has set up a fake speed camera outside his home in a bid to slow down drivers after the family cat was run over by a car			1
@entity8 said his daughter was ' devastated ' when their black - and - white cat @entity12 , who he called ' part of the family ' , was hit on a busy stretch of road near their home in @entity20 , @entity21			1
the father - of - two decided to take the situation into his own hands , creating the dummy out of a painted kitchen cupboard and putting it up outside his home			2
he said other residents supported his idea mr @entity8 , 27 , said : ' @entity12 was a very happy , friendly cat			1
it really upset my children so i decided something had to be done			0
' my speed camera has had a huge effect - drivers slow down and slam on their brakes when they see it			1
' someone in the village wrote on @entity48 asking drivers to honk when they drove past if they supported me and we hear so many horns beeping			2
' people have stopped and knocked on my door to say ‘ well done ’ and tell me they agree with me			0
' he said traffic collisions happened regularly on the 30mph road , which has a number of bends , and wants to see the speed limit dropped to 20mph			0
the first fake camera , which was attached to a 5ft - stick in his garden , was pulled down and burnt on saturday			2
mr @entity8 and a neighbour made another one to replace it and had screwed it into a fence panel - but it has since been stolen			1
now mr @entity8 , a recovery driver , has vowed to weld a metal version to replace it			1
effective : mr @entity8 said that the fake camera had been effective and that drivers on the busy stretch of road often slowed down when they spotted the distinctive yellow box			1
this version of the ' camera ' has since been stolen @entity78 said that the fake speed camera is on council land and wants it removed			1
mr @entity8 argues that it is on his land and added ' the main thing is that it works '			1
but one councillor conceded that the makeshift speed camera was ‘ very effective ’			2
@entity86 , a @entity87 , said : ' we want action			0
that fake camera is action			0
' although it ’s probably not what authorities want to see it ’s very effective at slowing traffic down and that ’s what people are clearly for			0
' @entity97 said it was not illegal to put up a fake speed camera , as long as it was on the resident ’s property			1
a spokesperson said : ' you can put anything up on your property unless it ’s distracting drivers and causing hazards			2
third time lucky : after having the first ' camera ' stolen , mr @entity8 built a second , pictured			1
this has since been stolen and he swears he will build a third , which he will weld on to the pole to stop it from being taken ' if mr @entity8 had put it up on council land , it could then become a civil issue for them			1
' @entity78 said it has a ‘ robust ’ system for handling speeding issues			2
a spokesman said : ' the council has a robust system for dealing with speeding issues raised by local communities			0
' issues should be referred to the local community area board , who will work with the local community to examine what speed control measures are appropriate for that particular road			0
' the considerations to deal with speeding issues will include the use of the volunteer speedwatch scheme , installation of speed indicator devices or other direct measures			0
' it is vital that any scheme introduced is effective and delivers the required result			0
' the council would ask everyone to follow the approved procedure to ensure the best scheme is delivered to meet the community needs			0
' a traffic survey monitoring vehicle movements on the @entity150 and through the surrounding villages started this week			0
the monitoring exercise uses automatic number plate recognition technology to individually track the behaviour of motorists in the survey area .			0
