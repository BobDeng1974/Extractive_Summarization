by @entity0 published : 07:11 est , 7 january 2013 updated : 23:37 est , 7 january 2013 scientists have revealed a series of three mysterious impact craters on the surface of the @entity5			1
dubbed the ' three amigos ' by experts operating the @entity9 which took the images , experts believe the craters formed within minutes of each other - but have no idea how			0
they believe the bizarre arrangement may have been caused by a meteorite or comet breaking up - or three separate impacts occuring in a unique coincidence			0
the ' three amigos ' spotted on the surface of the moon , with debris sprayed upto 1km away ' these three craters , located at 9.665 ° s , 7.646 ° e , appear to have formed more or less at the same time , certainly within a few minutes of each other , ' the researchers say			1
' the southwest crater is 180 m diameter ; the center crater is 150 m ; and the northeast crater is 125m across			0
' from the northeast crater center to the southwest crater centers , they cover about 450 m. ' the team has calculated that the projectiles were traveling from the east - northeast ( the right side of the frame ) and probably struck the surface at a relatively low angle , as indicated by the dust and other material they threw up - which extends as much as 1 km from the crater center			1

the low @entity45 accentuates the subtle topography associated with the impact craters , researchers say ' the morphology of the craters suggests that the southwest crater formed first , followed by the other two , ' the researchers who analyse data from @entity53 's lun the southwest crater may only have formed a few seconds or a few minutes before the other two , the team believe			1
the shape of the two northeast craters ( the low northwest - trending ridge between the craters ) suggests that the projectiles hit the surface at the same time such that the excavation process of the two craters interacted , forming the ridge			2
the three craters were formed withing minutes of each other , causing the unique ridges between them			2

unique *triple* craters were spotted by a @entity53 craft imaging the lunar surface
