‘ coming to a club as big as @entity2 , it takes everyone six months to understand the fan - base			1
‘ even when it comes to going out to a restaurant in @entity38 , you find half the people love you and the other half hate you			2
it ’s a big thing for newcomers to come in and accept this @entity44 and @entity2 divide - but i ’m sure he ’ll flourish			1
’ @entity0 was non-committal when asked if he ’d prefer to see @entity1 in @entity38 sooner rather than later			1

if it does n’t work , everyone at the club will be gutted to see him go			0
he ’s a good character and a good guy around the changing room			0

there ’s nothing anyone else can do			0
‘ he scored 30 goals last season and it is hard for anyone to score 30 goals in this league			0
