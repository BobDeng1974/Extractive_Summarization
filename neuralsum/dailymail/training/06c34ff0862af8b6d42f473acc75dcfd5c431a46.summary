by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 has never been one for a sugar coating			1
when he was about to win his 100th cap , he was asked to rate his own international career and gave himself a six before , after a pause , upping it to a seven			2
all at sixes and sevens ; it sums up 21st century @entity11 , @entity2 ’s generation , and they were much the same on thursday night			1
they fared no better in the winter chill of @entity15 than in the jungle sweat - box of @entity17			2
there was in fact less to admire in terms of flair and attacking promise than against @entity23			0
if @entity25 ’s team deserve credit for hauling themselves back into the game they were naïve to let it slip again and remain painfully fragile at the back against decent teams			0
@entity33 : @entity34 beats @entity36 team - mate to the ball in @entity15 looking back : @entity2 and @entity38 can only watch as @entity34 's header loops beyond @entity40 @entity2 must take his share of responsibility as the deepest midfielder — the man who missed his tackle in midfield as @entity34 opened the scoring and the man under the long ball which somehow made its way to @entity34 for the winner			1
the man who makes the tactical calls on the field			2
if he hoped the @entity55 might help erase the agony of @entity36 ’s title slip he appears likely to be disappointed			1
after surviving the early @entity60 assault , @entity11 were beaten by a simple long ball down the middle and a very good finish from a very good finisher , who somehow escaped the attentions of everyone			1
in @entity69 , @entity11 have lost two games they ought to have taken points from and , despite flickers of progress , @entity68 is proving just too tough			1
at the heart of all this , the 34 - year - old skipper is finding it hard to either influence the game or protect his defence			0
more @entity55 heartache ; he might be glad it will be his last			1
by now @entity2 knows the routine			1
there are no excuses and no hiding places , as he says himself			0
he can be his own harshest critic and he is a valuable voice on the state of the nation as @entity11 face up to the prospect of their first three - game @entity55 finals since their first , when the tournament was last in @entity69 in 1950			1
calm down : referee @entity94 speaks with @entity2 after a foul by @entity96 tough times : @entity2 was disappointing for @entity11 against @entity98 @entity98 elated as @entity11 sit on the brink in this twilight of his career , @entity2 talks with the gravitas of an @entity11 captain			1
these days he carries himself like an @entity11 captain , chest out , full of pride			1
he may not be a world - class player any more but he has quality			1
few could have produced the cross from the right when he whipped the ball towards @entity112			0
@entity2 has always addressed the ball with style , whether he be shooting or spraying passes			2
he no longer gets to take all the set - pieces but he can strike a dead - ball , as he did with the free - kick from which @entity119 headed against the bar			0
it is his defensive acumen which can be questioned , particularly in this deeper midfield position where he has settled with club and country over the last 18 months			0
@entity2 refers to it as the ‘ controlling role ’ but he has not been able to exert much control against @entity23 or @entity98			1
against the @entity130 midfield pass masters he could not get a grip of the game and there were similarities last night against an intense and highly motivated @entity60 team			0
watching brief : @entity2 looks on as @entity137 clears the ball in acrobatic fashion holding on : @entity2 tussles with @entity140 as @entity11 struggled to thwart @entity98 as @entity11 trailed 1 - 0 with 20 minutes to go , frustration tore through @entity2 and he was booked for a late and heavy challenge on @entity143			1
he was bounced off the ball by @entity34 early in the game , allowing @entity98 to counter quickly			0
it was a reminder that he lacks a defensive instinct			0
the priority was to ensure @entity34 did not escape beyond him with the ball but he tried to win it , got out - muscled and @entity11 were exposed			1
@entity98 ’s movement and tempo were excellent			0
they were inspired by @entity34 and the tactical tweak by coach @entity155 to play @entity156 behind the strikers , which kept @entity2 and @entity159 occupied			2
@entity2 ’s conversion is not complete			2
perhaps it never will be			0
his instinct is to play freely and fairly , not to stop others			0
strong in the challenge : @entity2 goes in hard on @entity165 in @entity15 @entity167 lesson : @entity2 and @entity168 trudge off at half - time after a punishing first - half the @entity171 does not cultivate these footballers			1
the speed , physical nature and rapid turnover of possession means the all - action heroes thrive — like a young @entity2 , @entity178 or @entity179			1
none of which means he should not be in that role			0
this will be his last @entity55 , maybe his final major tournament			1
but if he calls it a day , is there anyone better ? @entity187 , hailing from @entity23 where these qualities are cherished , always trusted @entity189 , but there is no going back to @entity189 or @entity191 and there is no young heir apparent			2
@entity194 has lots to prove			0
the empty cupboard might prompt @entity25 to plead with @entity2 to stay on as the @entity198 campaign gets rolling			2
it has been a soft - spot in the team for some time			0
@entity2 has helped to mask it			2
at times he looks comfortable in there but often he does not , especially against fluent teams like @entity23 and @entity98			0
it has been laid bare			0
perhaps even a five .			0

@entity2 made his 113th *appearance* for @entity11 , just two behind @entity208 , the most - capped player
in this twilight of his career , he talks with the gravitas of an @entity11 captain
this will be his last @entity55 , maybe his final major tournament but if he calls it a day , who steps into that role ?
