despite being left blind , @entity114 set up the @entity187 to help other police officers , paramedics or firefighters injured by a criminal act while at work			1
in a moving , heartfelt speech , mr @entity184 said : ' for me , it would be a beautiful irony and job done if legislation was passed so that there was no need for a @entity187			0
' @entity177 , ensuring that all injured servicemen in the line of duty should not want or wait for financial security and emotional support from now until the end of time			0
' mr @entity184 directly called on politicians to make supporting injured personnel law , saying : ' if you are a public figure who has stood by @entity1 sincerely in support , or as a cynical photo opp , your time is now and your duty is to make sure that there are no empty promises and hollow words - make the ethos of the @entity187 a political reality			2

' he added : ' it 's to his credit that he fought so long			2
' of that night in july 2010 , my friend looked danger in the eye and was not found wanting when asked to make the ultimate sacrifice , displaying bravery in a split second that collectively most of us will struggle to match in a lifetime			2
