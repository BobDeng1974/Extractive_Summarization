by @entity0 a giant robot in @entity2 may be able to @entity4 bungalows in a day , but the machine needed to pipe the concrete has to be bigger than the building it is creating - making skyscrapers an all but impossible dream			2
however , swarms of small robotic builders could soon overcome this problem to make structures much taller and wider than themselves			0
engineers in @entity17 have created a range of @entity19 that can work together , beavering away on different tasks , to construct large pieces of buildings			1
@entity23 : swarms of small robotic builders - including this vacuum bot - could make structures much taller and wider than themselves the @entity28 robots are team players and together they could build a skyscraper with very little human intervention , once their paths are mapped out			1
foundation robots build up the first 20 layers of mixture , similar to a large coiled pot. ‘ grip ’ robots that clip onto the sides of the walls take over the work to add more layers of piped mixture as they move along , climbing higher			1
vacuum robots use their suction power to creep up the side of a structure , adding extra piped mixture to reinforce it			1
in theory , if enough of these robots were used , they could built skyscrapers			0
experts at the @entity54 ( @entity54 ) in @entity17 created the ‘ family ’ of small construction robots that are all capable of constructing objects far larger than themselves			1
they work together squirting out concrete - like material that hardens quickly to form the structure of a building			2
however , the shapes of the buildings are determined by architects using computer software			0
foundation robots build up the first 20 layers of mixture by pumping out the quick - drying mixture , similar to a large coiled pot. their work is then taken over by ‘ grip ’ robots that clip onto the sides of the walls to add more layers as they move along piping mixture , @entity70 reported			1
a master of the trade : scientists have created @entity19 that can work together , beavering away on different tasks , to construct large pieces of buildings teamwork : the @entity19 work together squirting out concrete - like material that hardens quickly to form the structure of a building , which they can then clip onto ( pictured ) and continue their work vacuum robots use their suction power to creep up the side of a structure , adding extra piped mixture to reinforce it			1
if many robots are used together , they could rapidly create structures much , much larger than themselves as the building they would create could act as a sort of climbing frame			2
‘ each of the robots were developed was to perform a diverse task , linked to the different phases of construction , finally working together as a family towards the implementation of a single structural outcome , ’ their creators explained			0
frugal : the little robots could also cut construction waste produced in large quantities by traditional building techniques , as they only pump what they need ( pictured ) and there are no moulds or support structures laying the foundations : here , a foundation robot begins the structure by building up the first layers of piped mixture			1
other robots will take over the work when the structure becomes high enough for them to cling to suck it and see : vacuum robots ( pictured ) use their suction power to creep up the side of a structure , adding extra piped mixture to reinforce it foundation robots ( pictured ) build up the first 20 layers of mixture , similar to a large coiled pot ‘ hence , instead of one large machine , a number of much smaller robots working independently , but in coordination , towards a single goal			1
’ researchers @entity141 and @entity142 of the @entity54 explained that while huge robots can print small buildings quickly , they have to fit around a structure , limiting the size of projects , and are expensive			2
‘ making such machines is n’t economically reasonable , sustainable , and , in some cases , simply impossible due to their size , ’ they said			0
in contrast , there is no limit on what the @entity19 could create			0
‘ the robots can work simultaneously while performing different tasks , and having a fixed size , they can create objects of virtually any scale , as far as material properties permit , ’ they said , noting that such machines would also be easy for builders to take to construction sites			0
the little robots could also cut construction waste produced in large quantities by traditional building techniques , as they only pump out what they need and there are no moulds or support structures required to make structures			2
it is hoped more swarm robots will be created so they could take on the roles of plasterers and decorators too			0
a giant robot in @entity2 ( only its nozzle is pictured ) can 3d print 10 bungalows in a day , but the machine needed to pipe the concrete has to be bigger than the building it is creating - making skyscrapers an all but impossible dream ambitious : there is no limit on what the @entity19 could create			0

engineers in @entity17 created the range of robotic @entity206
they work together to build structures larger than themselves
foundation bots begin the building , letting gripper robots clip onto a structure and continue to build it higher by pipping lines of concrete
vacuum robots ' stick ' onto the side of buildings to pipe reinforcing lines
*future* robots could paint and decorate the inside and outside of buildings
