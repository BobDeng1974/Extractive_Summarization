sir @entity0 's remarkable letter revealing his reluctance to fraternise with @entity5 soldiers during the @entity7 truce in 1914 is set to go on public display tomorrow as the artillery fell quiet , @entity9 and @entity5 troops famously put down their weapons , emerged from the trenches , played football and swapped gifts in @entity16			1
but general sir @entity0 , @entity21 , shunned the @entity22 – because he did n’t trust the @entity5 to resist shooting an officer of his high rank , a letter he wrote to his wife reveals			1
@entity0 , who led the @entity25 , wrote the letter after visiting troops in a section of trench known as @entity30 in northern @entity31 on december 25 , 1914			1
he describes what he saw there as ‘ an extraordinary state of affairs ’ and tells of troops and officers from both sides ‘ walking about together all day giving each other cigars and singing songs ’			1
@entity0 , then 52 , who won his @entity21 during the @entity41 in 1899 and was known as ‘ squibs ’ , adds : ‘ i was invited to go and see the @entity5 myself but refrained as i thought they might not be able to resist a general			1
’ the letter came to light during research to mark the centenary of the outbreak of the @entity50			2
it was donated to @entity53 ’s archive service by the @entity0 family decades ago and was recently unearthed by researchers			1
in the letter , @entity0 , whose parents were from @entity57 , shows little sense of lasting @entity7 spirit towards the enemy			1
after being told ‘ the best shot in the @entity5 army ’ was among the cigar smokers enjoying the truce , he tells how he ‘ devoutly ’ hopes ‘ we down him tomorrow ’			2
the letter also illustrates the unofficial nature of the truce and how it was not upheld along the entire @entity72			2
‘ next door the two battalions opposite each other were shooting away all day and so i hear it was further north , 1st @entity25 playing football with the @entity5 opposite them – next regiments shooting each other , ’ @entity0 wrote			1
@entity0 , who was educated at @entity80 and @entity81 , later lost a hand in action but survived the @entity50			1
he went on to become governor of @entity85 , where he died in 1927 aged 64			0
historians say @entity0 ’s reasons for not joining in the truce were not without foundation			1
@entity50 author @entity105 said : ‘ some soldiers died on christmas day 1914			0
they got out of the trench thinking there was a truce and they got shot by @entity5 who did n’t want a truce			0
so it was a very courageous thing for them to do			0
’ @entity112 , head of documents and sound at the @entity114 , said : ‘ there are various accounts of the @entity22 story and this is a particularly interesting addition			0
’ the letter is being displayed at the council record office in @entity57			2
÷ the @entity121 said there are no grounds for further investigating the @entity125 advert recreating the 1914 truce which some viewers found ‘ distasteful ’			0
the watchdog received 727 complaints , but said ‘ the ad is not likely to break the rules surrounding serious harm or offence ’			0
on christmas eve , 1914 , @entity88 and @entity5 troops in @entity135 , @entity136 , put down their weapons for a 48 - hour truce			2
it was part of a series of widespread , unofficial ceasefires that took place along the @entity72			0
many soldiers , from both sides , independently ventured into @entity16 where they mingled , exchanging food and souvenirs			2
troops collected their fallen and held joint burial ceremonies			0
several meetings also ended in carol - singing			0
the most famous event of this day was the game of football played between the two sets of soldiers			0
the match reportedly started when a football was kicked by one of the @entity88 troops into @entity16			1
sadly @entity22 was never to be repeated			0
next year , strongly worded orders came from the high commands of both sides prohibiting troops from fraternising with each other			2
by 1916 , after battles of the @entity93 and @entity167 , warfare had become unprecedentedly bloody and no more truces were sought			0
the letter to his ' darling dear ' wife was written after visiting trenches near @entity173 in @entity31 on @entity7 in it , the senior commander detailed how news of the @entity7 football match spread quickly along the front - line , and his own fear that he might be shot by the enemy during the truce general sir @entity0 's extraordinary letter was read out by @entity50 re-enactor @entity185 , dressed in the uniform of a first world war general , amongst the shot at @entity189 at the @entity190 in @entity191 , @entity53			1

sir @entity0 penned the letter to his wife after visiting trenches
he talks of troops from both sides playing football and *sharing* cigars
but also reveals his own fear that the enemy could *n't* ' resist a general '
the historical letter goes on display tomorrow at @entity208
