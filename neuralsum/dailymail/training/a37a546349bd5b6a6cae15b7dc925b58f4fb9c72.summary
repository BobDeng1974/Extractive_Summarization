leaving : an official escorts a failed asylum seeker up the steps to an airplane waiting to take off from @entity4 in this 2006 file photo taxpayers have forked out more than £ 300million on flights and ‘ bribes ’ to persuade foreign criminals and illegal immigrants to go home			1
the bill has been racked up over the past five years as officials struggle to clear a huge backlog of overseas convicts , visa over-stayers and people who sneaked into the @entity19 in the back of lorries			2
in some cases , the migrants could only be convinced to leave with the help of so - called ‘ assistance ’ packages worth up to £ 1,500 each			1
they are free to spend the cash on education , medical bills , housing and even setting up a business back home			2
the highest sums were £ 68million spent in the year ending april 2010 and £ 71.8million the following year			2
last night @entity35 @entity34 said much of the blame rested with @entity37 , which handed the current government a border system in chaos			1
the bill only includes flights , assistance grants and , for violent offenders , guards on the journey			1
if the cost of prison sentences and the time taken by @entity51 staff to process the paperwork are included , the total would be far higher			1
@entity35 mp @entity53 , a member of @entity55 ’s home affairs select committee , said : ‘ this is another example of the appalling legacy and the incompetence of the previous @entity37 government , which lost control of our borders and security arrangements and created an overweening bureaucracy			1
’ the figures were revealed to @entity37 mp @entity67 , a member of the @entity69 campaign group , in a @entity71 written answer			1
it gives a total bill of £ 306million between 2009 - 10 and 2013 - 14 – including £ 55.3million in the last year alone			1
£ 300million : the bill has been racked up over the past five years as officials struggle to clear a huge backlog of overseas convicts , visa over-stayers and people who sneaked into the @entity19 in the back of lorries @entity84 chairman @entity83 of @entity85 said : ‘ the removal of immigration offenders is absolutely fundamental to the credibility of the entire system			1
this figure illustrates the huge cost of each case			1
’ he said that , given the level of public concern about immigration , the system was in need of more resources			1
under the facilitated removals programme – offered to foreign criminals and immigration offenders who agree to drop any remaining appeals – the grant can be used to set up a business , take an education course or pay for housing or medical expenses			2
handouts are worth £ 1,500 if a foreign prisoner signs up while serving their sentence or £ 750 if they wait until they have been released from jail			2
the grant is paid in cash , with the foreign nationals handed a pre-paid cash card on departure containing £ 500			2
on return home , they get the rest by contacting the @entity120 which administers the scheme for the @entity51 whose officials argue it is cheaper than forcibly deporting them after a long legal battle			0
porous ? @entity19 's prime minister @entity127 and home secretary @entity128 may walk through immigration at @entity130 during a visit to @entity133 staff at @entity134 , in this november 2010 file photo a vast camp for migrants in @entity138 will open this morning , sparking fears it will attract hundreds more to the @entity142 town			0
it will offer beds , showers , food and even power points to charge phones for the 2,500 migrants trying to reach @entity19 from the port			0
the @entity152 camp was built using a £ 3million @entity154 grant which would include cash that ultimately comes from @entity19 taxpayers			0
critics compare the centre to the @entity160 camp which became a magnet for migrants before it was closed			0
@entity35 mp @entity53 said : ‘ it is bonkers for the @entity138 authorities to do anything which encourages migrants to their town			1
it will only create problems for us next			0
’ by march the 12 acre camp , with three football pitches and a tennis court , will be able to feed 1,500 migrants by day and sleep 500			0
it is believed officers from the @entity176 will be on site to inform migrants of the realities of entering @entity19 , in an apparent effort to dissuade them			0
last october , ministers were attacked by the @entity19 ’s spending watchdog for failing to deport more foreign criminals			0
the @entity184 said the number of foreign prisoners had gone up despite a near tenfold increase in officials working on their cases			0
there are 12,250 foreign offenders in the @entity19 and the government spends around £ 850million a year on managing them			0
huge sums are also being spent on compensation for foreign criminals and illegal immigrants who were kept locked up for too long while officials fought to deport them			0
over the past four years , the total bill is £ 17million – with recipients including sex offenders , robbers and drug dealers			1
judges decided the claimants had been ‘ unlawfully detained ’ because the @entity51 continued to hold them even though they did not have a realistic prospect of booting them out			0
a @entity51 spokesman said : ‘ those with no right to be in the @entity19 should return home and we are determined to crack down on immigration offenders			0
' thanks to the efficiency savings made by this government , the annual cost of removing foreign nationals with no right to be here has fallen by almost a quarter – while the number of voluntary returns has risen sharply , from just over 27,000 in 2010 to more than 39,000 in 2013			2

@entity35 *mps* accuse @entity37 of handing over a border system in chaos
@entity225 only includes flights , assistance grants and guards on the journey
if the cost of prison sentences is included the total would be far higher
