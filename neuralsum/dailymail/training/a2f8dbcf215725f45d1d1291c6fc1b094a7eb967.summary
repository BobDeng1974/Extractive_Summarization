boots , 36 was suffering postnatal depression at the time and was under the delusion that her children were about to be taken away from her by social services			1

mr @entity36 , who described boots as ' someone who delighted in being a mother ' had also told the court : ' this is an almost indescribably sad case			0
' although the results of mrs @entity7 's actions were profoundly tragic given the loss of two young lives , what occurred was not criminal activity in the sense that expression is normally understood			1
' i unreservedly accept that what she did to the two children , that she and her husband loved and nurtured , were the results of physical and biological factors beyond her control			1
' now , nearly two years after the tragedy , the 36 - year - old has been seen in the neighbourhood where the incident occurred with her banker husband @entity27 , 36 residents in the area , known as ‘ @entity65 ’ because of its popularity with young , rich families , were surprised to see the couple return , but pleased that their lives looked to be getting back on track			1
one neighbour , who wished to remain anonymous , told @entity73 : ‘ people thought she 'd never return because the memories must be awful , but we 're pleased that she appears to be recovering			1
‘ those who know them are humbled by the strength of their relationship			1
it 's a tribute to their character that they appear to be picking up the fragments of their lives			1
‘ her treatment has clearly worked and you 've got to hope they can find peace			0
’ mrs @entity7 was suffering from post natal depression and feared her children would be taken away when she suffocated her ten - week - old son @entity8 ( pictured ) and 14 - month - old daughter @entity10 mr @entity97 had returned home to find his wife sitting in darkness , and his children lying side by side on the floor of a walk - in wardrobe boots was supported by her husband after she admitted two charges of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility in october 2012			1
at the time , she told the @entity29 : ‘ i will be eternally sorry ... but i am a good mum and i never meant this to happen			2
’ her not guilty plea to two murder charges was accepted by prosecutor @entity114			0
her husband , who was in court , has stood by his wife			2
on the night of the tragedy , he returned home from work to find the house in darkness and his wife sitting on the stairs , hugging herself			2
he ran upstairs and found their children lying side by side on the floor of a walk - in wardrobe in the master bedroom of the semi-detached house			2
they had apparently been strangled , the @entity29 heard			0
mr @entity97 was heard wailing : ‘ my lovely son , my beautiful daughter			1
help me , help me , help me			0
’ @entity7 , pictured , was supported by her husband after she admitted two charges of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility in october 2012 police at the family home			1
mr @entity97 told officers at the scene that his wife was a good mother and he ' could not believe that she would do such a thing ' his wife had been diagnosed with postnatal depression after the birth of both children			1
she had been prescribed antidepressant medication and her condition outwardly appeared to be improving			0
hours before she killed her children she sent a photograph taken on her mobile phone of @entity10 to her husband , who took this as a sign that she was feeling better			2
he was unaware that she had stopped taking the medication because she was worried about its side effects while breast feeding despite reassurances from her doctor			0
computer records show she made a series of @entity162 searches about her concerns in the preceding weeks			0
in a note found next to the bodies she ‘ questioned how she could have done such a thing ’			0
she wrote how ‘ she was scared and sorry ’ and that her ‘ life started to fall apart a few weeks before ’			0

his wife , who was ‘ unsteady and weak on her feet ’ , was arrested			0
mr @entity97 told officers at the scene that his wife was a good mother and he ‘ could not believe that she would do such a thing ’			0
the couple live in a £ 1.4million home in an area of south - west @entity14 known as @entity65 because it is popular with young , rich families many new mothers will experience a brief period of feeling emotional , irritable and tearful after giving birth , which is commonly known as the ' baby blues '			1
the latest figures show 85 percent of mothers can feel this way and it usually starts around three to ten days after giving birth and only lasts for a day or a few days			2
however , for a smaller percentage of mothers these feelings can develop into a deeper and longer - term depression , known as postnatal , or postpartum depression			1
around 10 to 15 percent of new mothers are affected , with symptoms usually developing within six weeks of giving birth , although it can be several months later			0
common symptoms of the depression include low mood , believing you are unable to cope , difficulty sleeping and feeling like you ’re not emotionally connected to your partner or baby			2
@entity207 says it is contacted by 9,000 women every year who are suffering from depression			1
research has also shown that around one to four percent of men experience depression while their child is under one			2
as long as postnatal depression is recognised and treated , it is a temporary condition you can recover from , according to the @entity217			1
experts advise mothers to ask for help , however many people do n’t seek treatment because they might not recognise what ’s happening or may feel afraid to ask			0
treatment for postnatal depression can include self - help techniques , cognitive behavioural therapy and antidepressant medicine			1
@entity229 is thought to be the result of several factors including the physical and emotional stress of looking after a newborn baby , hormonal changes and social problems including anxiety over money , and women who have a previous history of depression are deemed to be more at risk			2
some mothers experiencing depression can have some obsessive thoughts , become very frightened about doing something wrong , being in some way inadequate and having their baby taken away , or fear they may harm their baby in some way			0
most women who experience it wo n’t act on these thoughts , but it can still be frightening			0
if a mother is afraid that she may cause harm to the baby or herself then she should talk to her doctor as soon as possible			0
infanticide cases in the @entity258 are very rare			0
figures compiled by the @entity260 from between 2010/11 and 2012/13 show that in 6.4 per cent of the 1,1715 recorded homicide cases from that period the victim was aged under two ( around 110 children )			0
between 1995 and 1999 in @entity265 and @entity266 , 80 per cent of homicide victims under one year old were killed by a parent , according to research by the @entity269			0
however , there are currently no statistics available for how many infant deaths were attributed to postnatal depression .			1
