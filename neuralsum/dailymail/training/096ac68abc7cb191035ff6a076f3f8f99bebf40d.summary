by @entity0 it could be an example of life imitating art.			0
. or is it simply a dog marking its territory ? perhaps , this little pup is saying exactly what he thinks of this latest piece of graffiti in @entity12 by the mysterious @entity14 artist @entity13 ? either way , the mural has captured both the imagination of the public and dogs alike			1
dogged intuition : it looks like a regular fire hydrant so why should n't i lift my leg ? advice : i would n't sit there if i were you ! art ? the graffiti by elusive @entity14 artist @entity13 is part of his month - long @entity32 exhibit , in @entity12 enticing : seems as though dogs find @entity13 's work more interesting close up than people do ! @entity13 is staging a month - long ‘ residency ’ in @entity12 , but it seems that he 's having a tough time of it			1
his first two works were vandalized within hours of being created			0
the reclusive artist announced he would be ‘ attempting to host an entire show on the streets of @entity12 ’ throughout october in a project called @entity32			1
the first of @entity13 's new pieces showed two boys wearing caps , with one reaching up to a can of spray paint and a sign which said ' graffiti is a crime ' the first piece was found on the streets of the @entity57 neighborhood in @entity58			2
it showed two boys wearing caps , with one reaching up to a can of spray paint and a sign which said ‘ graffiti is a crime			0
’ the work , called ‘ the street is in play ’ , was accompanied by a telephone number which passersby could call for an audio guide to the painting			0
the audio informed viewers somewhat prophetically : ‘ before you , you will see a spray art by the artist @entity13			0
it 's probably been painted over by now			0
’ but within hours of its whereabouts being announced , the work had been first whitewashed and then covered with other clearly inferior graffiti but no sooner had word got out about the art work than it had been defaced , first with whitewash and then with other inferior graffiti which read : ' sweaty palms made me lose the love of my life ! ' a second piece of art was then uncovered in the @entity93 neighborhood underneath the @entity95 tourist attraction			1
the white , spray - painted text read : ‘ this is my @entity12 accent ’ in a traditional graffiti font , while underneath it was sprayed in a sans serif font : ‘ … normally i write like this			1
’ but that too has already been vandalized with someone spraying their own tag over the top of it			0
@entity13 , a pseudonym for the elusive artist who first emerged in the streets of @entity109 , @entity110 and whose real identity is unknown , has become a coveted contemporary painter in the art world , known for his trademark spray - paint stencils on buildings that offer social commentary			2
a second @entity13 piece was uncovered in the @entity93 neighborhood of @entity12 underneath the @entity95 tourist attraction unfortunately that too has already been vandalized with someone spraying their own tag over the top out of tune : not all art lovers are enthusiastic about the @entity13 tour , after the finding the artworks , @entity12 street artists immediately alters the images by the @entity14 street artist showstopper : @entity13 is touring the five boroughs			1
this latest piece was daubed on a wall in @entity133 , @entity134 opening night : @entity13 has come to @entity12 ¿ and @entity12 doesn ¿ t seem very impressed latest offering : this weekend @entity13 created some art in this truck hidden world : a woodland scene was created inside a truck pledge : the artist is going to unveil a new piece of art on each day of the month somewhere in the city , no matter the reaction of @entity12			2

the reclusive @entity14 graffiti artist has announced a month - long ' residency ' in @entity12
several of his pieces have been whitewashed over and others defaced
even dogs are peeing on his work
