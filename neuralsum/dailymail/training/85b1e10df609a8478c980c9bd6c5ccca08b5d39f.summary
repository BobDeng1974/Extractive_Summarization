@entity11 also posted an image of @entity12 's bloodied finger which he had injured in the robbery and when a friend posted a link to an online article on a local news website about the raid , @entity12 commented : ' hehehe that 's me			2
' @entity12 , 17 , left , and @entity11 , 18 , right , were sentenced to three years in a young offenders ' institute after raiding a newsagent and boasting about their crime on @entity6 when the pair were arrested two days later , detectives were able to further link them to the crime because they were still wearing the same underwear as when the raid took place			1
although that hapless duo 's faces were obscured in @entity46 footage taken from the shop , the waste bands of their underwear was clearly visible because of their low slung trousers			0
the teenagers were sentenced to 32 months for the robbery and four months each for another offence of attempted arson which emerged during the investigation into the robbery			1
hapless : the pair were caught after they posted this picture of their loot just 500 yards away from the newsagents they raided a judge at @entity63 also ordered the pair to pay Â£ 120 each in compensation to the newsagent who received minor injuries and was left shaken by the incident			1
detective sergeant @entity70 , of @entity71 , said : ' these two made it very easy for us to track them down and , in the end , you could say they were well and truly caught with their pants down			0
' they obviously thought it was funny to brag about their crime , sparing no thought for their victim , who they left battered and bruised and counting the cost of their theft and damage			0
' the pair also pleaded guilty to attempted arson after they filmed themselves lighting and throwing a home made petrol bomb into a @entity63 street two days before the newsagent robbery took place			1
officers investigating the robbery found the video on @entity11 's phone while investigating the raid			2
inspector @entity108 said : ' while there was no damage or injuries caused by the explosion , @entity11 and @entity12 's actions showed a reckless disregard for their own and other people 's safety			2
' the fact that they filmed their exploits and laughed at the bang suggests they were pretty happy with themselves			0
' i doubt they are laughing now			0
' it is by no means big or clever to play with fire and certainly not risk the lives of others			0
under no circumstances will we tolerate this sort of lawless , dangerous behaviour			0
' hearing : the pair were jailed for an additional four months at @entity63 for attempted arson after another offence emerged during the investigation into the robbery			2
