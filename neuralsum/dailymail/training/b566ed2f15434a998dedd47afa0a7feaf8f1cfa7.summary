the controversial surveillance program created by the @entity1 to collect records of any phone calls made to or from the @entity4 was today deemed unconstitutional by a federal judge			1
@entity4 district court judge @entity6 announced on monday that the extensive spying program likely breaks the @entity8 , which is the right that protects @entity4 against unlawful searches and seizures			1
the ruling is a boost for exiled @entity13 who exposed details of the @entity1 's huge data collection program to the public earlier this year , and is now exiled in @entity17			2
big brother : the @entity1 was revealed to be keeping track of phone calls made or received by @entity4 both abroad and overseas @entity21 broke the news that the judge 's ruling came in conjunction with a lawsuit brought to the court by a conservative legal activist , @entity28 , and his client who are both @entity31 users unhappy about having their records stored by the @entity1			1
the judge has ordered a preliminary injunction stopping the @entity1 from collecting mr @entity28 's and his client 's information , though the ruling could reasonably be pushed to include any such individuals			1
' plaintiffs have a very significant expectation of privacy in an aggregated collection of their telephone metadata covering the last five years , and the @entity1 ’s @entity44 significantly intrudes on that expectation , ' justice @entity6 wrote in his brief			1
' i have significant doubts about the efficacy of the metadata collection program as a means of conducting time - sensitive investigations in cases involving imminent threats of terrorism			0
' i can not imagine a more ‘ indiscriminate ’ and ‘ arbitrary invasion ’ than this systematic and high - tech collection and retention of personal data on virtually every single citizen for purposes of querying it and analyzing it without judicial approval			1
' indefensible : just last week , @entity1 director general @entity66 testified on @entity67 about how important the program was to keeping the nation safe against terrorist attacks judge @entity6 was appointed to the court by former president @entity72 who put some of the most wide - reaching surveillance protocols into place , which in turn adds some bipartisan weight behind the ruling			1
the ruling comes after a continued public debate over the inherently private tactics of the nation 's top spy agency			0
man behind the news : the @entity1 's practices have been questioned since @entity13 released the files in june the news about the phone collection program was initially revealed by leaker @entity13 , who collected files about the @entity1 himself while working as a consultant for the agency			2
he is now living in @entity17 and refuses to return to the @entity4 for fear of prosecution			2
agency representatives have repeatedly stood by the program since it was unveiled , including director general @entity66 who was quizzed about it on @entity67 last week			0
general @entity66 said in a @entity100 hearing on wednesday that the number of global threats are growing - specifically in @entity103 and @entity104 - and they pose what he called ' an unacceptable risk ' to @entity4			0
' there is no other way that we know of to connect the dots ... taking these programs off the table is absolutely not the thing to do			0
' @entity66 acknowledged the privacy concerns that have dogged the @entity1 since @entity13 's document release and submitted that the @entity1 is now open to talking to technology companies for a better solution without compromising security			2
' it 's like holding onto a hornet 's nest			0
we ’re getting stung , ' @entity66 said			0
but , ' if we let this down i think we will have let the nation down , ' he said .			0
