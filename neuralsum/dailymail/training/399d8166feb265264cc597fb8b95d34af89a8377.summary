a former @entity1 agent has revealed more odd rules from the world of airport security - including the time his co-worker told a passenger her goldfish was allowed on a flight , but its water could not travel			1
@entity11 , writing for @entity13 , defended his decision to blow the whistle on @entity1 checkpoints earlier this year , and revealed more insider details from his time as an agent			2
on one occasion , @entity11 said a passenger and his colleagues got into a ' heated ' debated about whether or not mashed potatoes count as a liquid - concluding that they should be classified as a gel and therefore banned from travelling through security			1
on another occasion , his colleagues got into a ' heated ' row over the liquid in mashed potatoes overreaction : @entity11 has continually sought to lay the blame for airport security frustrations at the feet of @entity1 bosses , not frontline staff in his post , @entity11 described the mixed response he had to his earlier revelations , with some @entity1 agents thanking him for criticising @entity1 bosses rather than frontline employees for the problems			1
but some felt @entity11 's anecdotes about his former co-workers still read as an attempt to smear junior staff			0
' they were angry that i seemed to place responsibility for the agency â€™s problems squarely on the shoulders of low - ranking employees , rather than focusing on upper management and underlying organizational problems , ' he said			0
@entity11 also revealed that he has been warned that intelligence agencies are likely to be monitoring him after he blew the whistle on @entity1 practices			1
' my ex-husband is now a senior executive at the @entity65 at @entity66 ... the @entity65 will probably track you , ' @entity11 recalled being told			2
orders from above : the former agent said that the most absurd security rules are passed down from officials at @entity1 headquarters to the front - line workers part of the process : since 9/11 air travelers have experienced many different requests from @entity1 agents , and passengers are used to taking off their shoes as they approach security in january @entity11 wrote his first article for @entity85 - ' @entity84 , i saw you naked '			1
in the piece he detailed the strange rules he 'd had to enforce - including telling a now - disabled young soldier on his way home from @entity92 that the celebratory bottle of champagne he was carrying was a risk to national security			2
the following month @entity11 revealed more rules issued by @entity1 bosses in an article for @entity100 , including making agents confiscate aluminum foil and ink cartridges , and a 2012 government memo warning that terrorists were plotting to use ' solar powered improvised explosive devices ' on airplanes			1
@entity11 has continually sought to lay the blame for airport security frustrations at the feet of @entity1 bosses who he says overreact to everyday items - such as banning tin foil specifically in case a passenger decides to use the serrated edge as a weapon			1
problem ? one @entity1 boss demanded that aluminum foil was taken away from passengers , fearing that the serrated edge on the box could be used as a weapon at the start of february , @entity126 security chiefs warned of a possible terror plot using explosives hidden in tubes of toothpaste during the @entity132 and liquids were banned from carry - on luggage			0
the ban on liquids , gels , aerosols and powders in hand luggage applied to all non-stop flights from the @entity126 to @entity142 , where the @entity143 was being held			0
@entity11 has previously recalled managers who wanted to have agents fired for chewing gum - in case their attention span was reduced and their ' defences down ' while chewing			2
in 2010 , the @entity1 faced ridicule and anger from business passengers for banning the transport of ink and toner cartridges after a terrorist plot was thwarted in @entity156			0
