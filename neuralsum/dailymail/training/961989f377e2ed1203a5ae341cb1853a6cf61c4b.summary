@entity0 , from @entity1 , revealed how she was spied on by hackers while she was in the bath a university student has revealed how she was spied on by hackers while she was in the bath			1
@entity6 student @entity0 was using her laptop to watch a dvd in her bathroom when she noticed her webcam suddenly turned itself on			1
miss @entity0 , 20 , from @entity1 , said : ' i was in the bath , trying to relax , and then programs on my computer came on like a ghost was using it			1
i could n't regain control of it			2
' it was terrifying to think people had been looking at me without me knowing			0
i wondered how often they had done it without me realising			0
the thought someone had access to me in this private moment is horrifying			1
' miss @entity0 , who also works in a computer shop , said she considered going to the police but feared they would laugh at her			1
called ' ratting ' , hackers can send out an internet virus that allows them access to a person 's desktop computer or laptop without their knowledge			1
they can then switch on the webcam – built in to most new computers – and watch people in the privacy of their living rooms and bedrooms without them realising they are being closely observed			1
a webcam is a video camera that feeds images in ' real time ' to another computer , computer network or the internet			1
a @entity54 investigation found the illegal practice is now so prevalent there is even a profitable underground market selling the ability to watch victims , who are dubbed ' slaves ' , for a few pounds			0
more worryingly , paedophiles are using the technique to target youngsters – mainly girls – who have computers in their bedrooms			2
the technique works by fooling the victim into downloading a piece of software on to their computer			0
this is usually done by sending an email requesting the user to click the link to see a picture or listen to a song			0
teenagers have been targeted through internet links advertising diet tips or celebrity stories			2
once installed , the ' remote administration tool ' ( @entity85 ) software allows hackers to take control of the machine at any time – similar to how it workers fix office computers remotely			1
hackers can then use a victim 's home computers as if sitting at it – doing everything from switching on the webcam to looking through personal files on the hard drive			1
a 16 - year - old from @entity100 called ' @entity101 ' told investigators he had hacked more than 100 computers – using the webcams to view the victims on about half of them			1
he said : ' i was n't really looking for anything , just their reactions			0
i 'd open random sites [ while the person sat at their computer ] – shock sites – they 'd see a scary picture or someone screaming , and you 'd see they were scared			0
there are creepy people who post pictures of female slaves			0
i 'm not really into that			0
' called ' ratting ' , hackers can send out an internet virus that allows them access to a person 's desktop computer or laptop without their knowledge he added : ' yeah , it is illegal			1
but the risk of getting caught is n't that much			0
it 's just a bit of a laugh			2
' @entity139 , 36 , was jailed for 18 months after he was found guilty of infecting more than 200,000 computers with a virus that allowed their webcams to be hacked			1
the father - of - five , from @entity145 , @entity146 , had watched dozens of women in their own homes , including girls as young as 16			0
he boasted to fellow international hackers he watched a teenager and her sister for hours and lamented how she had not got naked in front of him			2
@entity155 , of the government 's @entity157 campaign , said : ' as more cases of “ ratting ” come to light , there is a serious need to educate the public about the methods hackers use to access the private lives of innocent people			1
' there is a range of ways to prevent being spied on , experts said			0
covering the webcam with a piece of paper and installing anti-virus software will prevent most hacking attempts and delete @entity85			0
mr @entity155 said : ' the most at - risk computers are those running older software , and those without up - to - date anti-virus software installed			2
' the @entity181 said : ' police have come across webcam hacking through cyber investigations			2
any unauthorised intrusion into an individual 's computer is an offence under the @entity189			0

@entity6 student @entity0 thought police would laugh at her
