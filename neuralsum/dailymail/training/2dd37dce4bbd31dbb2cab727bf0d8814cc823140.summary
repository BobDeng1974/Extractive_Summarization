@entity0 suffered more misery at the hands of @entity3 on sunday night as the club that once denied his @entity6 team a place in the @entity8 gave him his first defeat in @entity10			1
@entity0 @entity6 were robbed back in 2005 in @entity8 qualifying when @entity12 wrongly ruled out a @entity14 goal			1
there was no injustice here however as @entity3 ran out 4 - 0 winners			2
@entity19 had won one and drawn two of @entity0 ' first three games in charge and had not conceded a goal but the solid start unravelled at the @entity26			2
first , captain @entity31 scored from a free - kick that came back off the underside of the cross bar and went over the line off goalkeeper @entity48 's back - side			0
then winger @entity49 , who is on loan from @entity51 and who has already been capped by @entity53 at international level , scored the second			0
the impressive @entity56 made the third for @entity58 , who then added a fourth on 85 minutes to complete the rout			0
@entity60 in action against former @entity51 and @entity63 midfielder @entity62 @entity3 defender @entity64 heads the ball while being challenged by former @entity67 man @entity66 it could have been even worse for @entity0 with @entity69 hitting the base of the post twice			1
@entity0 already knew the size of the task he faces in @entity10 and against @entity74 side @entity3 he saw the gulf in class between his players and those of rival coach @entity79			1
he now has a week to rebuild confidence ahead of the @entity82 derby next sunday against @entity83 , followed three days later by a tricky second leg cup tie against third tier @entity85 who drew the first game at home 0 - 0			0
@entity19 midfield @entity90 said : ' we need to start planning for the derby			0
it 's always one of the games of the season so we have to learn from this but put it behind us			0
' the former @entity99 manager has now won just one of his opening four games in @entity10 @entity103 , who scored @entity3 's second goal of the evening , competes for the ball with @entity106			1

@entity31 opened the scoring for @entity3 in their @entity30 clash
@entity51 loanee @entity111 *doubled* their *advantage*
@entity58 put the game beyond by scoring a brace
the defeat as @entity0 ' first since heading to @entity10
