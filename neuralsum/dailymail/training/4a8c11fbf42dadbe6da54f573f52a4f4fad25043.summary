@entity1 captain @entity0 has called for a repeat of the @entity4 blueprint when his side take on @entity6			1
@entity0 and company kicked off their @entity9 campaign with a impressive 2 - 1 win in @entity11 , coming from behind with a pair of late goals to take the points			1
a straightforward home success over the @entity16 followed at the weekend but that hardly required the levels of intensity needed in that opening fixture			2
@entity1 captain @entity0 is aiming to replicate the win over @entity11 , facing @entity6 on tuesday and the experience of seeing off higher - ranked opponents on their own turf is driving @entity0 as he eyes another prize scalp in @entity26			1
' all the away games will be difficult for us but we put in a great performance in @entity11 and we deservedly won the game , ' he said			2
' that 's the blueprint we 're going to work off when we play @entity6			1
that 's the standard we have to reach in every game we play in this group			0
' it will be no easy task but as a group we need to be at the top of our game every time to get results and that will be the case again			0
@entity0 , in action on saturday , is keen for @entity1 to copy the form shown so far in @entity9 qualifying ' we realise it 's going to be very difficult but we 're confident - after our opening two qualifiers - we can get a result			1
' @entity6 reached the @entity51 by maximising their return for every goal			2
they scored just 12 times in 10 qualifiers , but a stingy defence saw those goals converted into 25 points and they sealed second place behind @entity61			0
a defeat by @entity63 and a draw in @entity65 suggest the model is not yet as finely tuned under @entity67 as it was for his predecessor @entity68 , but @entity0 hopes for a typically close game			1
@entity70 celebrates after his strike put @entity1 1 - 0 up against the @entity16 on saturday @entity6 ( prob , 4 - 4 - 2 ) : @entity73 ; @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 ; @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 ; @entity82 , @entity83			1
@entity1 ( prob , 4 - 5 - 1 ) : @entity85 ; @entity86 , @entity70 , @entity87 , @entity88 ; @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity0 , @entity91 , @entity92 ; @entity93			1
referee : @entity94 ( @entity95 )			0
tv : live on @entity97 from 7.30pm ( kick - off 7.45 )			0
' looking at the past results before this game they tend to win or lose by the odd goal , ' he said			0
' we are aware of individual players that they have , but i think their strength is the team			0
having seen the game against @entity65 they are going to be a threat			2
' hopefully it will be tightly contested again and we can keep them at bay and create some chances ourselves			0
there are always very fine lines to get results in football matches			0
