by @entity0 published : 06:36 est , 10 september 2013 updated : 09:43 est , 10 september 2013 the family of an eight - year - old boy with narcolepsy are blaming the swine flu vaccine for his sleep disorder			1
@entity6 suddenly falls asleep up to 20 times a day and often collapses without warning			1
his mother @entity10 , 33 , and grandfather @entity9 , 60 , say he has also become bad tempered and blame his condition on the swine flu jab @entity13			1
@entity6 's mother , @entity10 , 33 , believes that he developed narcolepsy after having the swine flu vaccine			1
he now falls asleep up to 20 times a day and collapses if he gets excited the vaccine was given to almost a million children under the age of five in 2009 and 2010 before being withdrawn because of its links with narcolepsy			1
ms @entity23 , a mother - of - three , said : ‘ before @entity6 had the jab he was a very healthy little boy			1
it was only after that he started showing symptoms of narcolepsy			2
‘ it started gradually and at first he just seemed more tired than usual			0
‘ he 'd just started a new school year so we thought that might be causing it and did n't think much of it			2
‘ soon after , he started falling asleep and his teacher told us he kept napping at his desk and they would struggle to wake him up			2
‘ he found it exhausting to walk home from school and he started collapsing so we knew it was something serious			0
’ mr @entity9 , a chauffeur , said : ‘ since @entity6 had the jab it has been an absolute nightmare for us			1
’ @entity6 does not only have narcolepsy , he has also developed cataplexy - a sudden loss of strength triggered by a strong emotion such as excitement			1
ms @entity23 says that @entity6 has also become bad tempered and she blames his condition on the swine flu jab @entity13			1
she says that before he had the injection he was a ' very healthy little boy ' he had the injection in january 2010 and started showing the first symptoms the following september			2
doctors sent him for tests - including ct scans , sleep studies , mri scans , blood tests , a lumbar puncture and an @entity59 - before he was diagnosed with narcolepsy two years later			0
ms @entity23 , from @entity61 , said : ‘ for two years doctors did n't seem to know what was wrong with @entity6 , which was very distressing for us			2
‘ he would fall asleep up to twenty times a day and he started having mood swings			1
‘ when he was younger we used to call him the little @entity69 , he was very funny and happy			0
now he has really changed and he can be bad tempered			0
ms @entity23 says she knew @entity6 had narcolepsy before he was even diagnosed because she had read about the link between the injection and the condition ‘ it was only when i read about narcolepsy and its possible link to the swine flu jab that the penny dropped			1
‘ as soon as we saw it we just knew that was it			0
it was like someone was describing @entity6			2
‘ the doctors had to carry out their tests before they could make an official diagnosis but it did n't come as a shock at all when they told us he had narcolepsy			0
" @entity6 's family chose to treat his condition without the use of prescription drugs until may this year			2
mr @entity9 explained : ‘ the drugs initially offered to @entity6 are linked to anti-depressants and have very serious side effects			2
‘ they are drugs you do n't want a child taking if it can be avoided and so we went down the track of trying to alter and manage his lifestyle to combat the symptoms			0
‘ we took him to a child psychiatrist and altered his diet			0
we also noticed that it was when @entity6 would get excited that he would collapse so we tried to manage that			1
‘ the only thing he had to stop doing completely was playing football because he kept collapsing on the pitch			0
‘ we were worried for his safety so he had to stop playing for around two years			0
‘ now he 's older , he 's able to recognise himself when he 's going to collapse and he takes a few minutes out of the game so he has just started playing again			0
‘ we have to keep a close eye on him when he 's doing things like having a bath or crossing the road but we 've managed his condition as a family really well and @entity6 takes it in his stride			2
narcolepsy , which occurs in one in every 2,000 people , is a sleep disorder that causes a person to suddenly fall asleep at inappropriate times			1
it is a long - term neurological condition that disrupts normal sleeping patterns			0
symptoms include , sleep attacks , daytime sleepiness and cataplexy - temporary muscle weakness in response to emotion			0
it is often caused by an autoimmune response - this is when antibodies are released by the body but instead of destroying disease , they attack healthy cells			0
in the case of narcolepsy , antibodies attack the areas of the brain that produce a sleep - regulating chemical			0
there is currently no cure but the condition can sometimes be managed , for example , by taking regular naps , eating healthily and exercising			0
in some cases , medications such as antidepressants or stimulants can also help			0
it is thought that for every 55,000 children who were given the jab , @entity13 , one has developed narcolepsy			1
researchers , who published their findings in the @entity166 , studied 75 children with narcolepsy and found that 11 of these had received the vaccine before their symptoms began			1
the vaccine is associated with a 14-fold increase in a child 's risk of developing the condition			2
since 2011 , the @entity176 has prevented the use of @entity13 in people under the age of 20			1
‘ we can usually see when he 's about to collapse because his expression changes , his eyes glaze over and he starts to slur his words			0
‘ there are good days and bad days and sometimes he does get upset but on the whole he 's fantastic at coping with it			0
‘ what he 's doing during the day really impacts upon how bad his condition is			0
’ @entity6 's family eventually decided to try prescription drugs on a trial basis as they were concerned he would be bullied as he got older			2
they were first told he could have the drugs modifinal and sodium oxybate but modifinal has been stopped on medical grounds and the @entity199 has now said it can no longer fund the sodium oxybate			0
initially @entity6 's family decided to treat his narcolepsy with diet changes as they were worried about the side effects of medication			1
they then became concerned that he might be bullied so he is now on medication the youngster 's case has gone before a medical panel who are to rule on whether he can be given the medicine on an individual basis			0
mr @entity9 added : ‘ if he ca n't get the medication he 's not going to have the same chance as the lad next door			0
he needs this medicine to keep up with the kids at school			0
the chance of developing narcolepsy after receiving a dose of the vaccine is somewhere between one in 52,000 and one in 52,750 ‘ the condition is a particularly distressing for both patient and family to endure			1
‘ i hope @entity6 's case will help raise awareness of the link between narcolepsy and the swine flu jab and eventually force the @entity199 to take responsibility and compensate families like ours			1
’ an @entity199 spokesperson said : ‘ it is important to point out that the risk of narcolepsy is thought to be extremely low			2
‘ the researchers estimate that the chance of developing narcolepsy after receiving a dose of the vaccine is somewhere between one in 52,000 and one in 52,750			1
‘ due to the results of previous studies , @entity13 is no longer given to those under 20			1
’ so far , across the country , 11 children have been identified as possibly having developed narcolepsy after having the injection			1
while for the vast majority of children the swine flu jab proved harmless and effective , the @entity254 @entity253 has found that giving the jab to young children increases their chance of developing narcolepsy by 14 times			1
it may be that the children affected would have developed narcolepsy later in life without the injection			1
no one knows for sure			0
what is known is that by 2011 there was already sufficient concern over the potential link for the @entity176 to issue new guidelines banning the vaccination for anyone under the age of 20 .			1

@entity6 falls asleep up to 20 times a day and collapses if he gets excited
his mother , @entity10 , thinks the injection , @entity13 , was to blame
in 2011 the @entity176 ruled that the jab should not be given to people under the age of 20 because of the link to narcolepsy
the chance of developing narcolepsy after receiving a dose of the vaccine is thought to be between one in 52,000 and one in 52,750
more than ten children in the @entity254 have already been identified as possibly being affected by narcolepsy as a result of the vaccine
