by @entity0 published : 17:20 est , 1 december 2012 updated : 17:21 est , 1 december 2012 @entity1 is at the centre of an embarrassing row over drug legalisation , after her name was used to endorse a campaign run by her boyfriend ’s uncle , sir @entity7			1
the @entity10 - winning actress appears in a 17 - second @entity12 clip alongside sir @entity7 to promote breaking the @entity14 , a documentary made by his son @entity15 which sets out the case for decriminalising drugs , and supports a campaign of the same name			1
miss @entity1 , 37 , who lives with sir @entity7 ’s nephew @entity21 , does not appear in the documentary but features in the black - and - white promotional clip saying : ‘ i ’m @entity1 and i ’m breaking the taboo			1
’ black and white : @entity1 has appeared in a @entity12 video to promote breaking the @entity14 , a documentary which sets out the case for decriminalising drugs sir @entity7 runs the campaign and appears alongside the actress in a 17 - second @entity12 clip the film , released next week , includes contributions from former @entity33 president @entity32 , and is understood to argue that the current approach to drugs has failed and highlights countries where decriminalisation has been successful			1
asked by @entity42 on friday to clarify which aspects of the campaign she supported , sources close to miss @entity1 – who won a best actress @entity10 for her role in the reader in 2008 – said she was happy to promote the film and encourage debate , but was not calling for the legalisation of drugs			2
hours later , miss @entity1 ’s name and photograph were removed from a list of supporters on the campaign ’s website			1
the campaign is being run in conjunction with the film and suggests ‘ solutions ’ to the ‘ @entity60 ’ , including proposals to ‘ fully legalise and regulate the drug market ’ and ‘ decriminalise all drugs ’			2

last night the @entity12 clip remained on the @entity14 website , with sources saying the actress ’s involvement ‘ starts and ends with [ the @entity12 ] gesture of support for the film ’			0
a source said : ‘ there was a mistake , she should n’t have been on there			0
we ’ve had her taken off			0
‘ she does n’t support all the things on that list , she supports the film			2
‘ @entity1 got involved with the film because of her relationship with sir @entity7 ’s nephew , @entity92 does not , and never has , used drugs			1
her support for the film is because she supports the film ’s attempt to open the debate on alternative and more effective ways to end the misery that the drug trade causes			0
’ a film insider added : ‘ there is a very distinct feeling that any suggestion @entity1 supports the legalisation of drugs would have a very negative impact on her career			0
’ miss @entity1 was among more than a dozen stars , including @entity111 , historian @entity112 and @entity114 ’s widow @entity113 , listed as supporters of breaking the @entity14 , which calls on governments to ‘ end the war on drugs ’			1

its mission statement says : ‘ the policies of prohibition create more harms than good			0
’ it adds : ‘ we must seriously consider shifting resources away from criminalising tens of millions of otherwise law - abiding citizens and move towards an approach based on health , harm reduction , cost - effectiveness and respect for human rights			2
’ a spokesman for the @entity146 admitted miss @entity1 ’s name had been used in error , but stopped short of issuing an apology			0
she said : ‘ @entity1 has been supportive in joining the viral campaign for our documentary			0
@entity1 should only have been featured in the film / viral section , where [ the video clip ] now sits – this was rectified as soon as we realised the error			0
’ big names : the campaign is supported by a host of famous faces including @entity113 and @entity111 the row looks set to cause acute embarrassment for @entity163 and her boyfriend of 15 months , mr @entity21 , 34 , who works in marketing and ‘ astronaut relations ’ for sir @entity7 ’s @entity167 , the company which plans to take the first tourists into space			1
