with @entity3 ’s already facing increasingly tough competition from low - cost supermarkets , the staff motivational poster accidentally placed in its shop window earlier this week did it no favours			1
and now the sign - which promoted the ‘ @entity9 ’ campaign , urging @entity3 ’s employees to encourage their customers to spend more money in store - has been mocked by @entity14			1
the budget store took out a half - page advert in two national newspapers today , which contained similar images to the @entity3 ’s poster , and also had the heading ‘ @entity9 ’			1
@entity35 , advertising and marketing director of @entity14 @entity37 , told @entity38 today : ‘ we saw an opportunity to show - in a light - hearted way - how our customers can make savings of 50p and beyond by shopping with us			2
‘ as part of our # @entity34 campaign , we 're always looking for fun ways to surprise and delight our customers			0
’ and @entity14 was not the only firm enjoying the gaffe , with delivery service @entity48 posting a tweet saying : ' fifty pence challenge - save 50p with us , you may need it when you shop at @entity3 '			1
along with this was an image with the words : ' fifty pence challenge : let 's encourage every customer to save 50p during each parcel booking between now and the month - end			2
' it comes after the @entity3 's poster - which encouraged staff to try to make shoppers ‘ spend an additional 50p during each shopping trip ’ - was accidentally placed on the front window of a store			1
on display : the sign in the window of a @entity3 's store in @entity73 , east @entity74 , urged staff to try to make shoppers ' spend an additional 50p during each shopping trip '			1
this photo was taken by passer - by @entity78 the sign was spotted by tv freelancer @entity78 outside the store in @entity73 , east @entity74			1
he posted a photograph of the sign on @entity83 and it has since been retweeted almost 5,000 times , with @entity3 's confirming that the poster was ‘ intended for colleague areas in the store ’			1
the sign - with pictures of a purse and 50p coin - said : ‘ fifty pence challenge : let ’s encourage every customer to spend an additional 50p during each shopping trip between now and the year - end			2
’ mr @entity78 tweeted @entity3 's on monday , saying : ‘ not sure this is supposed to be in your window ’ , before an employee replied : ‘ yeah , i do n't think so either			1
which store was this ? i 'll give them a call			0
’ but responding to the worker - who identified himself as ‘ @entity104 ’ - mr @entity78 then said : ‘ oh i 'm not sure about that , @entity104 ... i kinda ( sic ) like that they 're giving folks a heads up ! ’ @entity104 replied : ‘ understood			2
i 'd really appreciate you letting me know which store though			0
’ getting involved : @entity14 was not the only firm enjoying the gaffe , with delivery service @entity48 posting a picture on @entity83 , saying : fifty pence challenge : let 's encourage every customer to save 50p ' mr @entity78 , enjoying the discussion , went on to ask @entity104 a further question and decided to create his own hashtag : ‘ how are staff supposed to encourage the extra 50p spend ? # 50pchallenge			1
’ but @entity104 replied : ‘ this is clearly a poster meant for staff areas			0
i 'd really like to make sure it gets to where it should be			0
’ on tuesday , after the picture went viral on @entity128 , mr @entity78 said : ' astonished by all the @entity130 's ( retweets ) of # 50pchallenge - i think i now qualify to go on @entity132 - so that 's a bonus			2
' and , speaking to @entity134 after the fallout over the @entity3 's gaffe , said : ‘ i think the real mistake @entity3 has made is to present this to staff as a challenge			1
‘ as a customer , i do n't want to feel like i 'm being forced or tricked into spending extra by staff who have been challenged to make me do so			0
error : the poster was ‘ mistakenly put on public display ’ at this @entity3 ’s store in east @entity74 ( file picture ) ‘ had the poster encouraged better customer service , or more effective promotions , i doubt there would have been this kind of reaction			1
’ a @entity3 ’s spokesman told @entity38 earlier this week : ‘ we often use posters to make store targets fun and achievable for our colleagues			1
‘ they are intended for colleague areas in the store , but this one was mistakenly put on public display			0
’ the company added that nobody was facing disciplinary action over the error , but it would be ‘ reminding teams on the guidelines for displaying internal posters ’			0
pr expert @entity170 told @entity171 that the error was ‘ embarrassing and not useful ’ for @entity3 ’s - but the retailer had ‘ much bigger issues ’ such as competition in the grocery business			2
meanwhile , @entity3 ’s has launched a strategic review which could see @entity37 ’s third - largest grocer cut its dividend as it became the latest big chain to announce a disappointing trading update			0
conversation : mr @entity78 tweeted @entity3 's on monday to say : ' not sure this is supposed to be in your window ' the supermarket cut its annual sales forecast and also said the review would leave ‘ no stone unturned ’			1
it is clear that shoppers in @entity37 are changing the way they do their food shopping			0
they are switching to the discounters and smaller convenience stores as well as online			0
this has hurt established players with both @entity199 and @entity200 having issued a raft of recent profits warnings			0
@entity3 ’s said that more consumers were now choosing to go to restaurants rather than eat at home and this was one of the factors behind underlying second quarter trading falling 2.8 per cent			0
first - half sales fell 2.1 per cent			0
the news sent the shares down 7 per cent or 17.5p to 234p to a six - year low			0
this morning , @entity3 's fell by another 1.5 per cent or 3.4p to 230.5p			2
more than £ 1billion was wiped off the value of @entity3 's , @entity200 and @entity199 combined yesterday .			2
