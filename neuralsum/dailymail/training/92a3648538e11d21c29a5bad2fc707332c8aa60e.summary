by @entity0 published : 05:35 est , 9 september 2013 updated : 11:00 est , 9 september 2013 a romantic man has gifted the love of his life 55,000 dresses over their 56 year marriage			1
@entity7 , 78 , wanted wife @entity8 , 76 , to have a different dress every time they went ballroom dancing			1
and his relentless desire to deck her out in a beautiful frock led to him buying dozens of gowns a week over the decades			0
but following a bout of ill - health and expensive storage costs - the dresses took up six full storage containers - the couple from @entity23 are now selling off the impressive collection			1
but he became as obsessed by the beautiful dresses worn by the female dancers as he did by the dance moves			1
he met @entity8 at a dance and said she ' changed his life ' after they fell in love			0
he writes on his website : ' @entity8 is the love of my life and has remained so to this very day			0
i followed her to the @entity46 and was disowned by my own family for doing so back in the 50 's			1
' we first lived in the @entity50 and with time travelled @entity52 and settled in @entity53 , @entity54			0
the dress collection grew as i searched far and wide at estate sales , department stores , yard sales and antique shows			1
always looking to buy more dresses for @entity8 , everywhere and anywhere i went			2
' walk - in wardrobe : @entity7 has bought 55,000 dresses for his wife over the decades on sale : @entity8 sifts through rails of her own dresses , gifted to her by her husband over 56 years of marriage - they will keep a couple of their favourites strictly come dancing : @entity7 discovered the pastime at the age of 13 and has loved it every since @entity7 explains how his love for @entity8 resulted in the huge vintage dress collection that 's now on sale via their website			1
he said : ' i loved seeing her dance and began collecting dresses for her			2
i would envisage @entity8 dancing in the dress , the look of it , the sound of it , and buy dress after dress for her to wear when we danced			0
' the 55,000 dresses were bought across the decades - sometimes as many as 30 at a time - but it was always the 50s styles that @entity7 likes best			1
' i was fascinated by the dresses from the 50s			2
the petticoats and the wide skirts made a woman look real feminine			0
and that is what i really liked			0
when i seen a gal with a dress like that , ' @entity7 tells @entity104			1
' i wanted to get her on the dance floor			0
' ' [ @entity8 and @entity107 ] went ballroom dancing every week , and i wanted her to have a different dress for every dance			0
' but @entity7 's fascination with the dresses went far beyond him just buying them for @entity8 to wear once a week			1
he bought a total of 55,000 - many of which his wife has never even worn			1
@entity7 told @entity104 he would buy the dresses ' before work , after work , sometimes during work ' raiding department stores and yard sales so he would sometimes come home with 30 dresses in one day			1
dancing through the decades : @entity7 and @entity8 met at a dance and enjoyed the hobby together every week never have enough dresses : the collection grew as @entity7 searched estate sales , department stores , yard sales and antique shows spoilt for choice : @entity7 wanted his wife to have a different dress for every dance			1
he loves how they make a woman look the most he ever spent on a dress was $ 300 ( nearly Â£ 200 ) and he would buy them regardless of size - meaning they often did n't fit his wife			2
he explained : ' if there was a dress that i liked , i could visualise what she would look like in it			0
and i had to have it			0
even if it was the wrong size			0
' you know , it 's a crazy idea , but i kept thinking maybe my wife grows into them , whether losing weight or gaining			0
' two children , five decades of marriage and 55,000 dresses later , they have reached a point where they want to sell off their astounding collection			1
' i do have some of my favourites that are n't for sale , ' he tells @entity166			0
' from the very first one i bought my wife to the one that makes the perfect swoosh sound			2
' ' at the time of purchasing the dresses i really had no idea about designer names , but i am discovering dresses that date back to the 1940s from designers such as @entity178 and @entity179			2
' vintage finds : he had no idea of designers at the time , but the collection boasts @entity178 and @entity179			2

@entity7 , 78 , and @entity186 , 76 , married in the 1950s
they moved around @entity46 where he bought her dresses
their impressive collection grew to 55,000 in 56 years
now selling them off *due* to ill - health and expensive storage
