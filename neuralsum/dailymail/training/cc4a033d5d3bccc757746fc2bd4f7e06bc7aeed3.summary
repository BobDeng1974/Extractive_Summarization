out late shoveling snow one night , former @entity1 lawmaker @entity0 spotted a dark object that seemed out of place in the storm			1
the strange mass struggling through the snow appeared to @entity0 to be a seal , but when he approached it , he found a 73 - year - old man in mittens and a hat with ear flaps in need of assistance			1
' on behalf of all seals , i 'd like to thank him for his interest , ' @entity16 told the @entity20			2
' if he had n't been as strong as he was , i think we still would be there			0
deciding to brave the elements rather than wait in the disabled car , he squirmed out of the passenger door and started walking towards a home in the distance			2
@entity16 's arthritic knees began to feel the toll of the weather and forced him to sit down to rest			1
when he tried to stand again , his knees would n't let him , so he decided to crawl towards help , contemplating ' what would happen if he fell asleep			0
' after an hour straining against the snow , @entity16 felt he could n't go any farther			2
' i made peace with the @entity47 and said " if it be your will , so be it			0
" and i just stopped , ' @entity16 said			0
' apparently it was n't his will			0
' not a seal : @entity16 was on his way to the hospital when his car got stuck and went out in search of help in mittens and a cap with flaps rescue : @entity0 was shoveling the driveway to make way for his son , who was returning from a night shift in the storm it was just at that moment @entity16 says @entity0 appeared , on an aborted seal rescue mission , and helped him to safety			1
@entity0 , who was out shoveling for his son returning from a night shift , took @entity16 into his home , spooning coffee into his mouth because his hands could n't hold a mug , according to the @entity77			1
a plow was dispatched to clear a path for an ambulance , which took 45 minutes to make it through the storm to pick up @entity16 , who was shaking uncontrollably			1
' i 'm sure i did n't do anything different than anyone else would have , ' @entity0 said .			0
