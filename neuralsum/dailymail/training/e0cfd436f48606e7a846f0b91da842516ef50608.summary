@entity29 , the @entity24 vice president of @entity30 , wrote on @entity31 , ' @entity5 should not have been penalized			1
officiating mechanic is not to flag player who goes to ground for religious reasons			0
' the rule that referees claimed @entity5 violated reads , ' prolonged or excessive celebrations or demonstrations by an individual player			2
players are prohibited from engaging in any celebrations or demonstrations while on the ground			0
a celebration or demonstration shall be deemed excessive or prolonged if a player continues to celebrate or demonstrate after a warning from an official			0
' according to @entity55 however , the former vice president of @entity54 in the @entity24 , players who pray after scoring a touchdown are not in violation of this rule			1
@entity55 even explicitly said as much on his @entity31 account in 2013 , writing , ' you 're not penalized for going to the ground to give praise after a td			2
' faith : @entity5 ( above , with his son @entity64 ) is a devout muslim who fasts during @entity67 pilgrimage : @entity5 ( above , with his son @entity64 ) also sat out the 2012 season so he could visit @entity70 during the @entity71 in october no response : @entity5 ( above ) has yet to comment on the call players praying after major plays and touchdowns has long been common in the @entity24			1
in fact , former quarterback @entity77 prayed so frequently during games that the act of kneeling with one 's head bowed and an arm resting on bent knee became known as ' @entity85			0
' @entity77 , who is a @entity86 , was never once penalized by the @entity24 for this action			1
@entity5 , who fasts during @entity67 and even sat out the entire 2012 season so he and his brother , former @entity24 safety @entity89 , could visit @entity70 during the @entity71 in october , has yet to respond to the controversy			1
but @entity5 's brother @entity92 told @entity93 that the penalty should never have been given and blamed possible ' ignorance ' on the part of the referee			1
@entity92 , a former @entity99 safety , said that his brother was merely thanking his @entity101 for allowing him to ‘ show off his gifts at such a high level ’			0
he said : ' we have always tried to be good examples of what @entity1 are about and try to bring out the best in @entity109			0
i do n't think it was ( a case of ) it 's a @entity1 celebration , we 're going to fine him			0
' maybe it was a bit of not knowing , simply a bit of ignorance by the referee			0
he did n't know what @entity5 was doing			2
' maybe he thought he was going down to pull something out of his jersey ... referees are human and make mistakes and he is erring on the side of being cautious '			0
@entity92 urged the @entity24 to educate itself and said that , compared to the slew of recent stories about the league , him and his brother are a positive story			2
he said that his brother prays five times a day and so when he was score the touchdown and was on his knees , a position known by @entity1 as @entity9 , it seemed natural to lower his head to the ground			1
@entity92 , who like his brother has been a devout muslim his whole life , said that when he saw his brother do this he thought it was ' beautiful '			0
he said : ' i thought he was representing the @entity24 , his family and his religion in the right way '			2
asked if he thought the league was racist , @entity92 said : ' i do n’t think the @entity24 is that way '			2
@entity92 also said that if a @entity86 player was given a penalty for doing something similar than his brother would feel that it was unfair to punish him too			0
tebowing : giving praise following touchdowns and major plays is common among many players in the @entity24 , most notably @entity77 ( above ) penalty or not , @entity5 's touchdown still helped carry the @entity6 to a 41 - 14 victory over the @entity12			1
this of course comes at a time when the @entity24 is already under fire following their botched treatment of numerous abuse scandals involving players including @entity161 , @entity162 and @entity163 , to name just a few .			0

@entity5 received a 15 - yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty after he performed the @entity9 during monday night 's *football* game
according to the former vice president of officiating in the @entity24 , giving praise after a touchdown does not *qualify* as unsportsmanlike conduct
the @entity24 has since *apologized* for the call , saying @entity5 should not have been penalized
