the ice - bucket challenge has been making more headlines and , as someone who found themselves nominated to do it , i can confirm it is not something you would want to do twice			0
i found myself nominated by a fellow @entity9 player and had no intention of pulling out , so i got drenched at @entity11 , @entity13 ’s training ground , earlier this week and i quickly handed the baton over to @entity15 , the @entity16 winger			1
let me explain why i chose him : @entity15 is a good lad from @entity13 , who has played for a number of clubs and is working hard to recover from injury			2
as there is a hole in my roof , @entity15 should appreciate why he received my nomination — and i ’m glad he accepted it ! seriously , though , it is a great cause and this is all being done in good spirit			0
meeting the challenge : @entity16 winger @entity15 also gives the thumbs up as he is splashed job done : @entity15 was nominated by @entity22 to take part in the popular @entity23			1

@entity22 took on the @entity23 at @entity11 earlier this week
the @entity13 *captain* nominated @entity16 winger @entity15
@entity15 did some work in @entity22 's house when he was a part - time roofer
