by @entity0 published : 06:37 est , 28 november 2013 updated : 09:57 est , 28 november 2013 two air passengers branded ' idiots not terrorists ' were cleared of threatening to blow up a plane today			1
@entity5 , 30 , and @entity6 , 42 , were arrested on may 24 after a @entity7 heading from @entity8 , @entity9 , to @entity10 was forced to make an emergency landing at @entity12 in @entity13			1
prosecutors had told the courtroom of the ' fear and panic ' caused by the alleged bomb threats but in the witness box passengers and flight crew admitted no bomb threats were heard and many had been angry the flight was diverted for such a ' trivial incident '			2
the judge in the case has now ruled they had no case to answer			1
cleared : @entity6 ( left ) and @entity5 ( right ) were dubbed ' idiots not terrorists ' and have been cleared of threatening to blow up a plane @entity31 , representing mr @entity5 , told the court today : ' in fairness to the prosecution , it is now common ground that had certain documents held by @entity38 been made available from the outset these two men would not have had to face trial			1
' it had been claimed @entity6 , supported by @entity5 , had made threats to kill crew and passengers after an argument broke out with air stewards at 30,000 feet			1
but passengers had said @entity6 had acted like an ' idiot ' but they were not threatened by him			1
today jurors at @entity50 were instructed to find the men , from @entity52 in @entity53 , not guilty of endangering an aircraft			1
judge @entity55 described the case as ' tenuous and peppered with inconsistencies '			1
he added : ' under the circumstances no jury can properly convict these men			0
' prosecutor @entity61 said : ' in light of the state of the evidence , it has been decided it is no longer appropriate to seek convictions in this case			0
' incident : the two passengers were on this aircraft when it had to be diverted from @entity10 to @entity12 held : one of the acquitted men is patted down by forensic police after the plane was brought into @entity12 by the @entity76 a series of witnesses told the court that although the men had acted like idiots , they had not heard a bomb threat			1
@entity83 , captain of the @entity38 flight @entity84 , originally alerted the authorities to the scare			2
but he later told the court that , as the severity of the diversion became apparent , he tried to reverse this decision by telling air traffic control the men were ' laughing and joking '			0
in statements read outside court , both men said they were relieved that their ordeal was over and they had cleared their names after wrongly being branded terrorists			0
solicitor @entity100 said : this is a victory for mr @entity6 , his loved ones and those that knew he was innocent of the allegations he was facing			2
' in the sky : the @entity38 plane as it was being escorted by a @entity76 jet over @entity109 into @entity12 in may path : the flight from @entity8 to @entity10 was diverted to @entity12 following the ' incident ' 10 minutes before it was due to land the court heard that @entity38 had released its own internal inquiry , which contradicted evidence given by its staff to police and in court , only when ordered to by the court			1
barristers for both men said they did not blame the police or @entity124 for the case being brought to court			0
@entity31 said : ' in fairness to the prosecution , it is now common ground that had certain documents held by @entity38 been made available from the outset , these two men would not have had to face trial			0
' speaking for @entity135 , mr @entity100 added : ' due to the misinformation supplied to the @entity109 authorities by members of the crew of flight @entity84 , the @entity109 was put to considerable expense			0
' mr @entity6 was wrongly vilified as a terrorist based on the same information			0
' mr @entity6 was separated from his family and remanded in custody for 73 days as a result of this misinformation			0
' scare : police meet passengers as they are led from the plane after it landed in an emergency at @entity12 , in a case that was dropped today he added that @entity6 was grateful to his own legal team , the prosecution and police for eventually ' uncovering the truth '			1
' his simple lifestyle has turned into one of the most challenging experiences a person can endure			0
he wishes to move on with his life and put this terrible ordeal behind him , ' he said			0
@entity164 , speaking on behalf of @entity5 , said : ' this case has collapsed after it became clear that witnesses against him had not told the truth			2
' this brings an end to six months of stress and anxiety for mr @entity5 and the cost to him and his family has been very high			0
' he 's delighted that his name has now been cleared and we will press for a full inquiry as to the conduct of @entity38 in this case			2

@entity6 , *41* , and @entity5 , 30 , ' have no case to answer '
@entity38 jet had to be escorted by *fighter* jets in may
plane was directed to @entity12 rather than @entity10
they were charged with *falsely* claiming ' that crew and passengers would be killed and the aircraft would be blown up before landing '
@entity50 judge says case is ' tenuous and peppered with inconsistencies '
