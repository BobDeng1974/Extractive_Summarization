by @entity0 published : 16:31 est , 6 september 2013 updated : 16:31 est , 6 september 2013 we return to @entity2 in the dead of night , six months after the death of @entity5			1
the honeyed stone of the great house is sheathed in velvety darkness			1
only a single bedroom light glows , high up near the eaves			1
a shadow moves across the window			2
@entity14 noise ? a baby crying ? a bat ? mrs @entity17 strangling a pheasant for lunch ? there ’s no way of telling			2
the walls of @entity2 must keep their secrets just that agonising bit longer			1
dancing into @entity2 : @entity26 and @entity27 are set to return to tv screens this week widowed : @entity29 will return as @entity30 but how will she cope with @entity5 's demise ? for yes , the fourth series of @entity2 is almost here			1
this year it will be accompanied by the brilliant new book @entity36 , a fascinating insight into the making of our favourite tv show , and serialised here exclusively			2
some of the chapters give a tantalising insight into what promises to be another classic series , although to be honest i ’m not sure if i ’ve recovered from the trauma of our last visit to @entity2 – the tear - stained @entity50 special that ended with the death of @entity5			1
a crumpled fender , a trickle of raspberry jam running down his noble brow , a man cut down in his prime after surviving the war , the convenient death of his fiancée @entity2 and the curious incident of the @entity62 ? nobody saw that coming			1
what exactly happened ? your guess is as good as mine			2
all that was clear was @entity5 lying at the side of the road , gone forever			2
the episode ended with @entity30 holding her baby , unaware her husband was dead			2
as @entity50 downers go , it was right up there with @entity78 not coming to town			2
in the new series we find out all that ’s left of @entity5 is a photograph in a frame , glinting in the lamplight on @entity30 ’s dressing table			1
a photograph – and an heir , of course			2
a proper male heir , unaware of his future inheritance as lord of @entity2 and all he surveys			1
good for him – but how is everyone else coping ? @entity30 , of course , is still in mourning			2
brother - in - law @entity96 will be a comfort , for he ’s been through a similar bereavement with the death of his wife , @entity100 , in series three			1
not too much of a comfort , perhaps , as before long keen admirers will no doubt be crunching up the gravel drive			0
meanwhile @entity105 and @entity106 continue to flourish despite all that ’s happened			0
that unpleasant affair with @entity109 the @entity110			0
the mysterious cousin who may or may not have survived the @entity114			0
those wrinkles have been smoothed over , like the newspapers ironed each morning for his lordship ’s perusal			0
@entity120 : @entity0 is looking forward to more sharp - tongued comments from the @entity122 setting : the spectacular @entity123 is once again the backdrop for @entity2 drama dowager countess @entity126 – played by @entity127 – continues to stalk the corridors of @entity2 with her silver - topped cane , looking for people to argue with			1
in this series , she finds herself with a new sparring partner			1
her old school chum @entity134 ( @entity135 ) is one of the few who is not intimidated by waspish @entity126			0
doubled - headed dame disputes ? we can expect some delicious clashes			0
elsewhere , @entity2 is in flux			1
we are in 1922 , but it ’s not quite the roaring 20s , not yet			0
however , the pall of war has been left behind			0
the world is changing – but some characters are keener than others to embrace the exciting new developments			0
in this , @entity149 leads the way			0
she is almost unrecognisable from the dowdy frump of series one , seduced by a different life in @entity155 and her relationship with @entity158 , her delectable editor at @entity159			1
in one scene in the opening episode , she has dinner with him at the @entity164 , a big step for a woman whose mother once told her she was never to eat in public			0
now here she is drinking champagne from a saucer glass and flirting with an older man			0
@entity2 is moving into the @entity172 in more ways than one			1
@entity175 plays @entity176 , the drama ’s first black character , a jazz singer who performs with his band at a party at the house			1
he then becomes embroiled with the @entity182 in unexpected ways – particularly with the wilful @entity184			0
coping with motherhood : the last episode ended with @entity30 holding her baby , unaware her husband was dead downstairs there ’s a new boot room where the servants can gossip and plot without being overheard			0
@entity194 and mrs @entity195 are still locked in a dysfunctional relationship , and all the old favourites are there , too			0
the @entity2 producers have promised there will be fewer departures and deaths in this series			1
thank heavens for that – how much more could we take ? they also promise a few guest appearances , including one from @entity209 , who stars as opera singer dame @entity210			0
so this is what we know			0
empires might rise and fall , wars begin and end , but the @entity182 have maintained their position in the social order			0
yes , the @entity219 wave and the dropped waist may have come to @entity2 , but some traditions will never change			1
as the curtain rises on series four , the family still dress for dinner and sit down to snipe and bicker over mrs @entity17 ’s pigeons stuffed with cherries			1
and that is just the way we like it .			0

@entity0 is looking forward to catching up with events at the @entity2
