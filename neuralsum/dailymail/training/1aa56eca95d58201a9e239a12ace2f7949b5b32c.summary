by @entity0 published : 19:59 est , 28 august 2012 updated : 06:42 est , 29 august 2012 all around , the city was in flames			2
broken glass was strewn in the streets			2
this was @entity6 , when @entity8 stormtroopers unleashed their hatred on @entity11 businesses , synagogues , shops and homes — and the fire brigade stood idly by			1
up to 30,000 people across @entity8 were arrested , beaten , murdered or sent to concentration camps			1
sir @entity18 , the founding father of the modern day @entity19 , escaped @entity8 and transformed perceptions of disabilities in sport hero : dr @entity18 ( right ) , the founder of the @entity19 , greets the queen at the opening of a news sports stadium disabled athletes on a site adjoining @entity30 , near @entity31 , in 1969 but , in the town of @entity34 , there was a hero of the hour : doctor @entity18			1
as traumatised @entity11 turned up at his hospital , he instructed staff to admit them , even if their injuries were too minor for an overnight stay			1
when the @entity40 arrived to round them up , he persuaded the officers that they were all too sick to leave			1
he saved 60 people from certain death in concentration camps			1
six athletes will ‘ fly ’ into tonight ’s spectacular @entity19 opening ceremony in golden wheelchairs , it was revealed last night			0
the dramatic scenes will be at the heart of the showpiece opening , which is expected to be watched on tv by a record billion people around the world , as well as 80,000 in the stadium			1
among those flying into the stadium in wheelchairs will be @entity61 ’s greatest ever paralympian , 11 - time champion @entity62 , 43			0
the ceremony , which is entitled @entity64 , begins at 8.30pm and will kick - start 11 days of sport in front of unprecedented crowds – the event is on course to be the first sell - out @entity70 in history			0
@entity61 is hoping for a record haul of medals surpassing the 102 won in @entity75 in 2008 as athletes are inspired by their home crowds , as happened during the @entity78			0
last night transport chiefs warned the @entity19 would pose a ‘ huge challenge ’ for @entity82 ’s transport network , saying they feared the many @entity83 who worked from home during the @entity78 would not be doing the same during the games			0
but @entity82 mayor @entity87 promised that the @entity19 would be a ‘ wonderful show ’ and would change the preconception of disabilities for good			0
as thousands rushed to buy the remaining tickets , the mayor said the opening ceremony would be ‘ superb ’ and that the public would be ‘ blown away ’ by the level of sportsmanship on display			0
tonight ’s event will open with the words ‘ o wonder ! how many goodly creatures there are here ’ from @entity106 ’s @entity105 , with a young actress playing the character of @entity109 leading the audience through the ceremony			2
@entity18 is also the inspirational neurosurgeon who founded the @entity70 and changed the course of thousands of lives			1
before 1948 , when @entity61 last hosted the @entity78 , patients with severed spinal cords were rarely rehabilitated , let alone to the extent that could compete in sports			2
with no active life to look forward to and poor care , they contracted infections , gave up hope , and were usually dead within weeks or months			0
but @entity123 meant hospitals were flooded with servicemen who had suffered this type of injury			0
enter dr @entity18 , a @entity11 @entity128 refugee who had fled to @entity129 in 1939 and was working at the specialist @entity30 in @entity31 , @entity131			1
@entity18 was a passionate believer in the power of sport to inspire and motivate — and he introduced an athletic competition in the grounds of the hospital to coincide with the @entity78 at @entity82 ’s @entity138			1
his first event was wheelchair archery			0
though only 16 competitors took part , including two women , the notion of paraplegics becoming athletes was ground - breaking			0
his games gave birth to the @entity19 , and he was nicknamed @entity150 by one and all — commemorating his role as the father of the @entity70 sixty - four years later , his dream has been well and truly realised			0
tomorrow , 4,200 athletes from 165 nations will begin competing with the world watching them			0
but @entity18 ’s early life gave no hint to the visionary he would become			1
he was born in the coal - mining district of @entity161 ( now @entity162 ) in 1899 to an orthodox @entity11 family , and took a volunteer job at a local hospital for mining injuries when he was 18			1
he was particularly touched by the plight of one young miner he tended			0
this man had a fine physique but had broken his back in a mining accident			0
he was paralysed from the waist down and the doctors held out no hope			1
the accepted method of treatment in those days was to encase patients in plaster and isolate them			2
they would die within weeks			0
this is what happened to that young man , who got a urinary infection and blood poisoning , and died within five weeks			0
@entity18 said later : ‘ although i saw many more victims suffering the same fate , it was the picture of that young man which remained indelibly fixed in my memory			1
’ the archery competition at @entity30 was the precursor to the modern paralympics , giving war veterans with terrible injuries strength and confidence bringing hope : dr @entity18 was a passionate believer in the power of sport to inspire and motivate so he introduced an athletic competition in the grounds of the hospital to coincide with the @entity78 in 1948 the following year , @entity18 started medical studies at the @entity206			1
he continued at @entity207 , and developed an interest in physical training and sport			0
he was already a member of a @entity11 fraternity determined to use sport to impart confidence and self - esteem to members feeling the scourge of @entity217			1
after failing to find a job in paediatrics , he returned to @entity34 and enrolled in the neurology and neurosurgery department			0
by the time @entity222 had risen to power in 1933 , @entity18 was director of @entity34 ’s @entity11 hospital			1
his growing reputation led to many offers to work abroad			2
he turned them all down — until @entity228			0
in 1984 prince @entity229 opened the @entity19 , complete with sombrero @entity231 : the first event to take place was wheelchair archery			0
though only 16 competitors took part , including two women , the notion of paraplegics becoming athletes was ground - breaking by then , @entity18 was married with two children , @entity242 and @entity243 , and he knew he ’d have to leave @entity8 for their safety			1
he got £ 250 ( £ 10,000 today ) from the @entity246 — a charity led by the master of @entity249 ’s @entity248 — and started work in the city ’s @entity251			2
dr @entity18 was a popular figure , but there were many who thought his ideas fanciful			1
he tirelessly argued , though , that with proper treatment paraplegics could live full and rewarding lives @entity18 made such an impression that the government asked him in september 1943 to open a centre for spinal injuries , anticipating a rise in patients after the planned d - day landings against @entity8			1
he agreed on the condition he could implement his own treatment theories , and picked @entity30 for his base , taking up his post on february 1 , 1944			2
his unit was called @entity272 and had 26 beds and one patient			2
@entity18 was a popular figure — but there were many who thought his ideas fanciful			1
he tirelessly argued , though , that with proper treatment paraplegics could live full and rewarding lives			2
@entity279 was a critical part of the therapeutic programme he designed for his patients			0
@entity18 ’s daughter @entity283 , who at 79 is a torchbearer and this year ’s mayor of the @entity70 village , recently said : ‘ my father ’s big thing was that he was determined to make his patients taxpayers			1
‘ one of them told me he was lying in a corner of the ward feeling sorry for himself and my father came along and asked , “ what are you doing ? ” he said he was waiting to die			2
so my father said that , whilst you ’re waiting for the @entity301 to take you , go to the workshop and do some carpentry , do some work , start a career			0
and this chap told me that after leaving hospital , he actually became the head of a building firm and did very well			1
’ @entity18 ended up inspiring thousands — and changing the way the nation thinks about paraplegics			1
last month , a statue to him was unveiled at @entity30			0
but his real legacy will be the performances during the next two weeks			0
as his son @entity242 told the participants of the 1980 @entity319 : ‘ you are my father ’s memorial			2
’ the @entity161 took on the @entity322 at basketball in the 1955 @entity324 at @entity30 for spinal injuries @entity327 archers joined the 1954 competition as word of dr @entity18 's work at @entity30 began to spread @entity331 lives on : members of the @entity70 are welcomed by dancers during a welcome ceremony at the @entity335 in @entity82			1
this year 's games are expected to be the most successful ever			0

@entity18 told doctors to admit @entity11 to hospital even if they did not need treatment
saved 60 people from certain death by telling @entity128 officers they were too sick to leave
arrived in the @entity346 in 1939 after fleeing the @entity347
led inspirational initiative to treat people who had become paralysed
dr @entity18 impressed the government enough to open spinal injuries unit
