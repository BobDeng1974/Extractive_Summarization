by @entity0 published : 02:32 est , 9 july 2012 updated : 02:46 est , 9 july 2012 concern : fire crews in @entity3 rescued 620 animals last year which is a 60 per cent increase over six years if you have a cat stuck up a tree , or a chimp up a chimney , the fire brigade should not be the first people you call , fire chiefs said today			1
@entity14 is concerned that it is having to deal with a rising number of animal rescues , with crews called out on average every 14 hours to deal with a creature in trouble last year			1
fire crews in the capital had to rescue 620 animals last year , a 60 per cent increase over six years , and have already had to deal with more calls in the first half of this year than the same period in 2011			1
unusual rescues in recent years include a chimp in a chimney , a parrot trapped in its cage , an iguana stuck on a roof and a hamster trapped in a disabled lift			2
fire crews have also had to capture a snake at a retirement home and rescue a kitten with its head stuck in a bongo drum			0
the fire brigade is highlighting some of its more bizarre animal call - outs as part of a campaign to encourage people to keep an eye on their pets , and warn the public that they should not necessarily call 999 to help animals			1
fire chiefs want to dispel the stereotype of firefighters rescuing cats from trees , saying that if an animal is stuck somewhere the public should always call the @entity58 first			0
busy : @entity14 ( crew pictured ) says it was called to rescue an animal every 14 hours last year and said owners need to keep an eye on their pets currently more than half the animal rescues fire crews are called to in @entity3 involve cats and around a quarter are to help dogs in distress			1
in the past five years @entity14 has been called to rescue : an iguana from a roof in @entity70 in may 2007 a parrot trapped in its cage in @entity74 in january 2008 a dog stuck in a wheelchair in a flat in @entity78 in may 2008 a puppy with its head stuck in an exercise machine in a house in @entity83 in april 2008 a kitten with its head stuck in a bongo drum in @entity86 in october 2009 capture a snake at a retirement home in @entity89 in july 2009 two dogs in a toilet in @entity92 in july 2009 a chimp in a chimney in @entity70 in january 2010 an adult hamster trapped in a disabled lift in @entity97 in april 2010 a kitten trapped in a reclining chair in @entity100 in may 2012 london fire commissioner @entity101 said : ' it is time to dispel the old stereotype about firefighters rescuing cats from trees , our crews are highly trained emergency service personnel			1
' if there is a cat up a tree , or an animal stuck anywhere , the first port of call should always be the @entity58 , not the emergency services			0
' and he said : ' pet owners need to keep a close eye on their animals in a bid to avoid some of these situations happening			2
what 's worrying is that when firefighters are out rescuing animals , they 're not available to attend real emergencies			0
' each animal rescue costs money and in these tough financial times , many people question why their taxes are being spent on some of the animal rescues we 've highlighted today			0
' @entity136 , of the @entity58 , said the animal welfare charity advised people to call them first and if they needed help they called the fire brigade			2
she added : ' if you see a cat up a tree , we 'd advise you to leave it for 24 hours before calling the @entity58 as they usually manage to get themselves down			0
after all , when was the last time you saw a cat 's skeleton up a tree ? '			0
