by @entity0 , @entity1 editor published : 12:21 est , 6 february 2013 updated : 02:34 est , 7 february 2013 a @entity3 meat company , which claims to supply schools and restaurants , has been identified as importing large quantities of horse meat			1
@entity8 , based in @entity9 , has been named as the key source of consignments of tonnes of beef that illegally included horse meat			1
large blocks of what were supposed to be beef off - cuts were imported by @entity8 from @entity18 and then sold on to food manufacturers in the @entity3 and @entity20			1
contamination : meat sold by @entity8 is likely to have ended up in homes and schools ( library image ) however , it has now emerged that much of this meat was horse and is likely to have ended up as burgers and ready meals in homes , fast food restaurants , market stalls and , potentially , schools			1
a large consignment of meat , where samples were up to 80per cent horse meat , was imported by @entity8 and sent to cold storage at @entity40 , northern @entity20			1
@entity8 also supplied 60 tonnes of beef , some of which is known to have been horse meat , to @entity44 , in southern @entity20 , during 2012			1
it sold this on to @entity46 , in @entity47 , who made tainted burgers for @entity50 , @entity51 , the co-op and @entity53 , among others			1
the amount of meat involved suggests tens of millions of tainted burgers were produced during 2012			0
news of the @entity3 link to the horse meat scandal brought demands for urgent action by the government and the @entity63 ( @entity63 )			2
to date , @entity3 ministers and the @entity3 food watchdog have largely left the investigation to their counterparts in southern @entity20 , who first revealed the contamination three weeks ago			2
it now appears that a @entity3 food company with connections to manufacturers , caterers , schools and market stalls across the @entity3 and @entity20 had a central role			1
gone : @entity53 has withdrawn items from its today 's special range and @entity50 some of its @entity81 products @entity8 , which was established in 1994 , lists its headquarters as being in @entity9 with other bases in @entity84 , @entity18 and @entity85 , @entity86			1
its partner companies include @entity88 , while the firm 's website boasts : ' @entity88 was established to service the catering side like restaurants , schools and market traders			0
' with our modern storage facilities in @entity97 and our refrigerated vans , we have open up a complete new market which we see as being another new string to our bow			0
' the company 's website says the management have been working in the meat trade since 1989 and so have gained a ' reputation for being a reliable and trust worthy partner in the meat industry '			0
the @entity63 will be investigating which food manufactures in the @entity3 and beyond were supplied by @entity8			1
it will be keen to establish any links with the @entity3 manufacturer , @entity113 , which is based nearby in @entity114 , @entity115			0
it made burgers contaminated with traces of horse meat for @entity119 and @entity53			2
careful : spaghetti bolognese and lasagne were the beef products taking the hit @entity126 's shadow food and farming secretary , @entity127 mp , called on the government to order urgent tests on meat sold in schools , hospitals and other public services			1
she wrote a letter to the @entity136 food and farming secretary , @entity138 , saying : ' the @entity63 needs to conduct tests on food supplied to public sector caterers to ensure that contaminated meat has not been served in hospitals and schools			0
' what guarantees can you give that no adulterated meat has gone into school or hospital food , or been supplied to other caterers in the public sector ? ' she warned consumer confidence in processed meat is being severely undermined			0
@entity44 insists it was shocked to be told that the meat supplied by @entity8 contained horse			2
it said : ' the company , its management and staff are shocked and astonished to discover that equine content has been identified in products which have been imported and supplied through @entity44			0
' @entity8 passed enquiries to its lawyers who did not respond to a request for a comment			0
it has emerged that ready meal packs of lasagne made in @entity167 for the @entity169 brand have been withdrawn from @entity3 shops because of concerns they may contain horse meat			1
at the same time , @entity50 and @entity53 removed packs of frozen ready meals which were made by the same @entity167 supplier - @entity176			1
@entity50 said : ' following the withdrawal of @entity169 beef lasagne , which is produced by @entity176 ( correct ) , we have decided to withdraw our frozen @entity181 , which is produced at the same site , as a precautionary measure			1
' there is no evidence that our product has been contaminated and the meat used in the @entity169 product is not used in our product			0
however , we have decided to withdraw the product pending the results of our own tests			0
' @entity53 said : ' following an alert from our @entity167 supplier , @entity176 , @entity53 immediately withdrew its @entity195 and @entity196 from stores as a precautionary measure			1
' @entity176 has flagged concerns that the products do not conform to specification			2
' @entity169 @entity3 said : ' the supplier that produces @entity203 has informed us that they have a labelling issue and have asked us to withdraw the affected product			2
empty : the news came as @entity209 removed burgers from its frozen food section			2
@entity212 , @entity213 ' we are also currently conducting a full re-assessment of our supplier 's sourcing			0
' @entity169 @entity3 said it withdrew its 320g , 360g and 500g lasagne meals as a precautionary measure			2
the company insisted it was not a food safety issue			0
' deserving consumers ' trust is a key priority for us , ' said a @entity169 @entity3 spokesman			0
' as part of that commitment , we have been constantly reviewing our supply chain			0
' the decisions by @entity53 and @entity50 come on the same day that @entity209 removed four own - brand frozen burger products from sale following the discovery of beef contaminated with horsemeat at a manufacturer in @entity20			1
@entity209 also described the move as a ' precautionary measure ' , made despite assurances from food watchdogs that it was not necessary			0
it followed revelations that a consignment of beef that contained up to 80 per cent horsemeat had been found at a cold store operated by @entity40 of @entity249 .			0
