by @entity0 last updated at 2:00 am on 21st january 2012 @entity1 last night joined the chorus of demands to strip disgraced banker sir @entity4 of his knighthood			1
the deputy prime minister ’s intervention means all three main party leaders have now backed a review of the honour for the @entity12 chief			1
@entity14 ’s @entity13 is to consider whether to ask the @entity15 to revoke sir @entity4 ’s knighthood , which was bestowed on him in 2004 for ‘ services to banking ’			1
under fire : calls for sir @entity4 , seen here with his wife @entity23 , to lose his knighthood have intensified with @entity1 backing @entity25 's opinion the deputy prime minister said : ‘ @entity28 should be deserved and awarded to unique people who have made @entity31 a better place			1
‘ i sympathise with those who think it a travesty for a man who did so much damage to the @entity31 economy and made so much money in the process to retain his knighthood			0
‘ i understand the outrage and there is an independent process that deals with revoking honours – they must be left to make their own decision on this			1
’ mr @entity48 has said the @entity13 should take into account a damning report into the collapse of @entity12 by the @entity52 last month			1
@entity25 , left , has backed calls for sir @entity4 to have his knighthood removed while @entity48 , right , is sympathetic to the calls too and revealed a secret @entity14 body is to consider revoking the title it said poor decisions by sir @entity4 were a major factor in the crisis that led to @entity12 being bailed out with £ 45billion of taxpayers ’ money			1
meanwhile , @entity64 mp @entity63 has tabled a series of questions over the granting of sir @entity4 ’s honour			1
mr @entity63 is demanding all correspondence between @entity71 officials , ministers and special advisers relating to the honours list of 2004			1
@entity75 , who was chancellor that year , is said to have backed sir @entity4 ’s award , but it emerged yesterday that the @entity79 government then led by @entity80 , now a @entity82 peer , pushed sir @entity4 ’s nomination			1
mr @entity63 has tabled a @entity85 motion arguing it was ‘ perverse and unacceptable ’ that sir @entity4 should keep the knighthood			1
@entity64 chairman @entity87 and @entity82 ’s shadow education secretary @entity88 also backed calls for the knighthood to be forfeited			0
the @entity71 , as the department which recommended the @entity12 chief , pictured in 2009 , for the award in 2004 , is expected to set out reasons for its removal to the @entity13 but lord @entity80 insisted sir @entity4 was not the only person to blame for the collapse of @entity12			1
he said : ‘ i think the reasons for what happened at the banks are more complex than just one person			0
‘ @entity4 made mistakes , but so did a lot of other people at @entity12 , including people on the board who also have honours			1
they appointed him and agreed the strategy and have never been held to account			0
‘ i think the government , both the @entity82 and @entity64 government before it , were making mistakes about regulation			0
‘ i sympathise with the public concern on this issue but i think if you are going to have a system that is relatively independent and fair in allocating these awards then you need to have a system that is independent and fair in looking at removing them			2
’ by @entity121 arrogance : sir @entity4 who was removed from his job in 2008 the only surprise about the clamour to strip sir @entity4 of his knighthood is that it has taken so long			1
it was all the way back in october 2008 , in the tumultuous days following the crash of @entity128 , that he was unceremoniously removed from his job as chief executive of the @entity131			0
@entity12 had all but collapsed and was nationalised at a cost to taxpayers of £ 48billion			1
but , even in those final hours , he negotiated himself an astonishing pensions package originally worth £ 16million , or £ 693,000 a year for the rest of his life			2
heading for the lifeboat first , as the ship was listing , was an act of selfishness and hubris seldom matched in @entity31 public life			0
the disaster at @entity12 immeasurably damaged this nation and all who live in it			1
it has tainted banking and the financial system , one of the great pillars of @entity31 ’s modern prosperity , and massacred the reputation of all bankers			1
far more seriously , it has destroyed life savings , and helped condemn the nation to slow growth and surging unemployment			0
and at the heart of this catastrophe was @entity4 , a man who had a swagger and an arrogance unmatched in a financial world not short of egos			1
his mad drive to turn @entity12 into the world ’s largest bank drove him to trample over all those in his way as he indulged in a frenzy of reckless lending			1
the consequences of his appalling misjudgments are being felt today , and will be for years to @entity176 bank abandoned all pretence of traditional @entity79 prudence and lent to anyone who knocked on the door			0
among those able to borrow money was the ambitious entrepreneur @entity183 , who needed money to buy the high street shopping chain @entity186 ’s			0
when @entity12 pulled the plug on the company this week , 10,000 jobs were placed at risk , adding to the tens of thousands already lost at @entity12			1
@entity4 came to believe he was better than anyone else at what he did			1
there is no greater testimony to his overweening vanity than @entity12 ’s monstrous ‘ @entity196 ’ , built on a greenfield site at @entity198 on the outskirts of @entity200			2
this folly was designed to please the chief executive , and hang the shareholders and customers			0
secure in his palatial headquarters , he organised his surroundings , including the kitchens , allegedly so that scallops , a favourite dish , could arrive at his desk while at their moist best			0
there was a private aircraft , @entity214 , a fleet of @entity217 limousines stamped through with the @entity12 logo and a suite at the @entity220 for his @entity222 visits			2
most disgracefully of all , @entity4 felt so above the rules that governed the lives of ordinary @entity12 employees and staff in other large organisations that he felt able to conduct an extramarital affair with a senior female colleague			1
he then hid behind a court injunction until he was found out			0
@entity4 ’s willingness to use the law to hide his egregious behaviour has become notorious			2
when a @entity235 diarist reported on the supposed scallops kitchen he sued for libel			0
more recently , he hired lawyers to sanitise the investigation by the @entity52 into the firm ’s collapse			2
as a result , @entity4 receives only a handful of mentions in the report			2
what does come through loud and clear is his hectoring and bullying , which made colleagues too scared to challenge him			0
at the height of his reign , in the summer of 2008 , after he had wasted £ 49billion of shareholders ’ money buying the badly - run @entity255 bank @entity254 , i visited him for lunch			2
when i questioned the wisdom of buying a bank in the middle of a credit meltdown , he forcefully defended his actions			0
it was ignorant and dangerous bravado			0
the deal must rank as one of the greatest derelictions of duty by a chief executive in modern @entity270 knighthood – arranged by @entity75 in 2004 – makes a laughing stock of all those deserving of the honour			2
it also casts a terrible pall over the honours system and cocks a snook at all those suffering because of @entity4 ’s mistakes			1
his is a case so exceptional the @entity15 , on the recommendation of government , should not hesitate to remove this blot on the business world			0
to do so would show the world what moral capitalism actually means , and perhaps even give the banking system the fresh start it craves			2
by @entity288 and @entity289 defiant : @entity290 who the prime minister said should not receive ' a penny in bonus ' @entity48 vowed to block a £ 1million bonus for the boss of a failed bank rescued by the taxpayer yesterday			2
the prime minister ’s war on excessive executive pay comes as critics said @entity131 boss @entity290 should not receive ‘ a penny in bonus ’			0
mr @entity290 , 51 , is said to be in line to enjoy a £ 1.5million windfall despite the fact that the bank ’s share price has halved over the last year			0
asked if he would act to stop the bosses of state - owned banks receiving £ 1million bonuses , mr @entity48 replied : ‘ the short answer is yes			0
’ the prime minister announced that the government would cap cash bonuses in the two state - owned banks – @entity12 and @entity317 – at £ 2,000 for all employees and would use its clout as major shareholder to limit the amount in shares paid to senior executives			1
no 10 sources said the prime minister is ‘ determined to act ’ and would assure that there was no repeat of the ‘ absurd ’ bonus paid to mr @entity290 last year , which topped £ 2million			0
yesterday experts expressed fury that mr @entity290 could be weeks away from a bonus while the rest of the country suffers an income squeeze			0
sources say mr @entity290 is adamant he deserves his bonus for his role at the helm of the disgraced bank , which was kept afloat with £ 45billion of taxpayers ’ money			2
but sir @entity342 , chairman of @entity12 , insisted rumours that a £ 1.5million bonus has been agreed are ‘ inaccurate and premature			1
’ he said : ‘ neither the remuneration committee nor the board has discussed the position on the bonus for our chief executive for 2011 at this stage			0
any suggestion to the contrary is therefore untrue			0
’ the timing is particularly awkward because business secretary @entity355 will on tuesday reveal his plans for curbing executive pay .			0

@entity25 is also calling for wider reform of the honours system
sir @entity4 was given the award in 2004 for ' services to banking '
he steered @entity12 to the brink of collapse and left taxpayers with £ 45bn bill
