if the @entity1 awarded points for apologies , @entity0 might already have made amends for the latest red card of his controversial career			1
as it is , even @entity0 ’s own teammates at @entity8 are growing tired of their captain ’s excuses after they were left to battle fellow strugglers @entity13 for an hour with 10 men			1
@entity0 was sent off in the 32nd minute for shoving @entity13 defender @entity15 and then aiming a low blow into the groin of @entity18			1
@entity0 ( left ) hits out at @entity18 in the groin during the first half of @entity8 's game against @entity13 @entity0 's red card was the ninth dismissal he has received over the course of a controversial career @entity27 's strike means he is the joint top - scoring @entity28 in the @entity1 this season alongside @entity30 with 14 goals			1
the 32 - year - old will now miss the next three games in @entity8 ’s survival fight – @entity36 derbies against @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39 – and apologised profusely to his teammates and the club ’s supporters after saturday ’s costly defeat at the @entity44			1
but @entity27 , who cancelled out @entity46 ’s opening goal only to see @entity47 head a late winner for @entity13 , said : ‘ there ’s only so many times you can say sorry			1
‘ it ’s a silly sending - off and it ’s kind of cost us the game			1
he ’s the villain and rightly so for getting sent off			2
he ’s got to deal with it			2
‘ he ’s going to miss the next three games and he ’s an important player for us , he ’s our captain			2
’ new @entity8 head coach @entity57 wants to take his players away on a training break this week and will use the opportunity to speak to @entity0 , whose ninth red card of his career followed a @entity1 record seven consecutive yellows			1
@entity66 chief executive @entity65 called for @entity0 to undergo anger management in may 2012 after the midfielder was banned for 12 games for lashing out at @entity71 players @entity72 , @entity73 and @entity74 , and @entity57 has not ruled it out as an option now			1
the midfielder pushed @entity13 's defender @entity15 before attempting a low blow on @entity18 the @entity8 captain trudges off the field after receiving his marching orders in the first half ‘ it ’s something i would discuss with the player and see what he ’s open to , ’ said the @entity8 boss			1
‘ the medical staff are very good here so i ’m sure a whole range of things have been discussed with him in his career			2
‘ he ’s quite an intelligent lad and i ’m sure he would be open to anything that he thought could help him			2
we ’ll have a discussion in the cold light of day away from this incident and see where we go next			2
’ @entity0 apologised to his teammates at half - time and to fans on @entity102 , but insisted that he was only defending @entity103 after the teenage debutant had angered the @entity13 players with a late challenge on @entity46			1
‘ senior pros should n’t be running over asking for him to be sent off , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ if the boot was on the other foot , i would n’t be screaming for a 19 - year - old kid from @entity13 to be sent off			1
‘ @entity15 has run 40 yards to not only get in the ref ’s face and scream for a red card but he barged me in the process			1
@entity116 scored an 89th minute winner for @entity13 as they moved up to 15th in the @entity1 table ‘ i ’ve stupidly reacted and touched @entity18 up			1
absolutely no malice , i did n’t intend to hurt @entity18			2
but i ’ve been a fool and i ’ve been rightly punished for it			0
‘ you see other incidents where people make contact with other people ’s faces and it is n’t a red card			0
without making excuses for my own actions , it ’s stupid but not malicious			2
‘ i was sitting in there for a couple of hours just thinking how stupid it was			0
the sickener for me , as someone who puts the team above everything else , is that i ’ve let the team down			0
‘ i ’ve apologised to everyone and come out and fronted up			0
i ’ve always been one , when i ’ve made mistakes , to hold my hands up and say i ’ve made a mistake			0
‘ it ’s a testament to the kind of person that i am that i ’ve fronted up			0
i ’ve made a mistake , i ’m human			0
i ’ll try my utmost to atone for it in whatever way that is			0
all i can say is i ’m sorry i ’ve let people down , certainly our fans and the players			0
@entity27 ( right ) feigned a knee injury in celebration as a reference to his reported failed medical ahead of a proposed move to @entity13 last summer after making it 1 - 1 ‘ i ’m a man of substance and a man of principle			1
i can only apologise to the lads , i ca n’t chop my arm off and give it to them			0
obviously , if i could rewind it and take it back , i would n’t do it			0
‘ there are no excuses			0
as a 32 - year - old with a few hundred @entity1 appearances , and someone who ’s been captain of the club for a while with a very public profile , i should know a lot better			2
‘ people will lambast me from pillar to post and i have to accept that			0
as one of the tallest trees , you catch the most wind			0
i wo n’t shy away from it			0
‘ there ’s a long way to go between now and the end of the season and i hope to atone for it because that ’s all i can really do			0
