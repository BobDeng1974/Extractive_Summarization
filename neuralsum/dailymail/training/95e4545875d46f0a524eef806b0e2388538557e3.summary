mr @entity32 's speech today will inevitably be compared with @entity34 's 1963 address to the @entity36 capital in which he declared ' @entity38 ' in solidarity with residents of @entity5 at the height of the @entity42			1
during the brief trip , the president will hold meetings with @entity36 chancellor @entity46 and other government officials but is likely to face some tough questions over his handling of the @entity51 surveillance scandal			1
there have already been tense moments on the trip , in particular during the president 's discussions with @entity82 leader @entity81 over the @entity84 crisis			0
during the summit , @entity27 and daughters traveled to the @entity87 to do some sightseeing			0
at points , @entity15 and @entity17 had seem less than enthralled with the outings including a visit to the medieval @entity92 in @entity93 , @entity94 and the picturesque @entity95			0
the @entity11 and her girls kept it casual for the short jaunt , spending tuesday in jeans and sneakers and enjoying a pub lunch with rock star @entity102			0
it was all change when the family landed on the continent with @entity32 appearing to have found the tie he ditched during the summit while his wife and daughters ramped up their @entity111 star quality			2
the president 's visit comes nearly 50 years to the day after @entity34 's famous @entity42 address in @entity5			1
changing times : protesters at @entity117 play on @entity32 's presidential slogan @entity118 while telling him that he was welcome in @entity7 ... but @entity51 policies were not @entity120 : @entity32 is met by officials at the airport in @entity5 after a short flight from @entity56 however compared to his last visit in 2008 - when then presidential candidate @entity32 received a rock - star welcome from 200,000 people - this trip is likely to be more uncomfortable visit for the @entity58 leader who faces tough questions in @entity131 over the @entity51 surveillance of @entity58 citizens			1
protesters gathered on tuesday at @entity117 - the @entity136 crossing point between @entity137 and @entity5 during the @entity42 - to show their outrage at the @entity32 administration 's surveillance of email and phone records			1

the @entity58 leader was also likely to face tough questions from @entity36 officials over the @entity51 matter and leaks about the agency 's secretive methods by whistleblower @entity170			2
@entity7 's federal data protection commissioner , @entity172 , has already called the @entity58 's access of thousands of private social media and email accounts ' monstrous ' , according to the @entity175			2
casual look : @entity145 with daughter @entity15 and @entity17 in jeans and sweatshirts while visiting @entity95 in @entity56 earlier on tuesday @entity32 will tomorrow set himself up as the heir to @entity34 when he makes a speech in @entity5 in front of the @entity10			1
it is almost exactly 50 years since @entity34 addressed a crowd of @entity36 at the height of the @entity42 and declared : ' @entity38			1
' his successor as @entity58 president will attempt to channel the memory of that historic occasion when he delivers an address in the aftermath of the @entity55 in @entity56			0
@entity32 's speech on wednesday will not be the first one he has given in @entity5			1
speech : @entity32 , pictured today at the @entity55 in @entity56 with @entity195 and @entity196 , is set to give an address in @entity5 on wednesday @entity198 : @entity34 delivered an iconic speech in @entity5 on 26 june , 1963 - almost exactly 50 years ago five years ago , when he was still seeking election as president , mr @entity32 received a rapturous reception on a brief tour of @entity131 where he was greeted as a leader who could give the world a fresh start after the controversial presidency of @entity208			1
now he is a much more divisive figure - although his re-election last year was welcomed by most @entity131 , recent revelations about his administration 's spying on internet communications have tarnished his record in the eyes of many			0
mr @entity32 's speech tomorrow will inevitably be compared with @entity34 's , which took place on june 26 , 1963 at the @entity219 , a few miles away from the @entity136 which had been under construction over the previous two years			1
@entity34 's speech , considered one of his best , held up @entity7 as a symbol of freedom on the front line of the battle against communism			2
it featured the famous line : ' all free men , wherever they may live , are citizens of @entity5 , and therefore , as a free man , i take pride in the words , " ich bin ein @entity238 ! " ' people have since suggested that the @entity36 quotation was in fact a mistranslation , meaning ' i am a jelly doughnut ' rather than ' @entity38 ' , although no one appeared to comment on this at the time			1
when mr @entity32 , than a senator for @entity248 , visited @entity5 in 2008 , he gave a speech to a crowd of more than 200,000 people , attracting headlines such as ' @entity7 meets the superstar '			1
for his visit this week , by contrast , leading magazine @entity254 greeted him with the headline ' @entity258 '			0
although the president remains broadly popular among @entity36 , many are angry with his failure to close @entity263 bay and the @entity58 policy of targeting @entity266 militants with drone attacks			0
moreover , recent revelations about the @entity51 monitoring phone calls and internet use have further shaken his image			2
' he is still popular but not like he was , ' @entity272 , who heads the transatlantic relations programme at the @entity274 in @entity5 , told @entity275			2
' there 's disappointment in @entity7 that he has n't been able to close @entity263 and there are concerns about his tactics in fighting terrorism			2
people have realised he 's not a saint and he 's not all - powerful			0
' last time : mr @entity32 drew a crowd of 200,000 for a speech he gave during his election campaign in 2008 meeting : the president is set to hold talks with @entity36 chancellor @entity46 ; they are pictured in 2011 mr @entity32 , who has not visited @entity7 since becoming president , is believed by many to have neglected @entity131 in favour of regions such as @entity293 and the @entity294			1
he will give a speech to 4,000 invited guests on the eastern side of the @entity10 , in the @entity298 square - apparently chosen to avoid an embarrassing contrast with the turnout in 2008			0
@entity36 chancellor @entity46 is likely to seek to take advantage of the meeting to boost her own chances of re-election ahead of the polls in september			0
talks between the two are likely to touch on issues including the ongoing eurozone crisis , the extent of the @entity58 surveillance programme and the future of war - torn @entity84			0
ms @entity46 , who hails from the centre - right , is sometimes said to have enjoyed better relations with @entity208 , who invited her to his ranch in @entity317 and quizzed her about growing up in @entity318			0
