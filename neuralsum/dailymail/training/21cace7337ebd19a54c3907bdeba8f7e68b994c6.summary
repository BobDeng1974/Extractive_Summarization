a fifth of us will try to cut down on alcohol in 2013 but sadly few will succeed just one in 11 people manage to keep their @entity6 's resolutions for at least six months , according to new research			1
just under half break their resolutions within a fortnight , blaming a lack of will power			1
and of those planning to make a @entity6 's resolution , almost a fifth plan to cut back on alcohol			1
the poll of 4,000 adults by @entity18 found 55 per cent have made @entity6 's resolutions in the past , and 23 per cent have made a resolution for 2013			1
when asked how long previous @entity6 's resolutions had lasted , nine per cent said they stuck to them for at least six months			2
however , 39 per cent had given up within two weeks			0
of those that plan to or are thinking about giving something up for 2013 , 19 per cent said they would cut down on alcohol			1

@entity40 , @entity41 at @entity18 , said : ' we wanted to find out how good the great @entity44 public are at sticking to those fabled @entity45 , which it turns out we find harder to stick to than we might think			1
' we 'd encourage the fifth of us who already plan to cut down on alcohol to go one step further and give @entity34 a go - by raising some much needed cash to help beat cancer , you 'll have an even better reason to make it past the two week mark and stick to the resolution for the whole of january			1

@entity65 - to start , pick one habit that will have the biggest impact on your life if changed and focus on it			0
planning to hit the gym , give up @entity73 and eat better all at once is taking on too much , according to research carried out by @entity76 , a psychologist and author of @entity78			1
do the first thing for a month , then you can add more changes			0
make it easy - do n't start by planning to train for an hour every day or eat nothing but meat and veg if that 's a huge change in your habits			2
' if you 're working out , aim for five to ten minutes a day , ' says @entity90 , author of @entity92			0
' if you 're planning to de-clutter your home , start with one drawer rather than your whole house			0
' the positive feedback from these tiny goals will help you tackle bigger tasks later			0
ignore the negatives - focusing on what you 're not going to do can lead to a ' behavioural ironic rebound ' - or , more simply , if you resolve to stop eating cake , you 'll eat more cake			2
according to research from @entity104 in the @entity105 , you should focus on positives rather than negatives , such as resolving to eat more veg and protein			2
use if / then patterns - programme your brain as you would a computer and you wo n't need to wrestle with temptation all the time , says professor @entity114 of the @entity115			0
' set up cues that prompt your planned behaviour , ' he suggests			0
for instance , ' if i feel hungry before lunch then i will eat an apple , not a chocolate bar '			2
conserving willpower in this way also means you 'll have more left over for other things			0
get help - joining forces with a partner boosts your chances of sticking to your resolutions , according to @entity114 's research			0
when groups were told to make if / then plans with and without the help of friends , those who used a support group saw vastly increased chances of success			0
and besides , you 'll need someone to spot you on the bench .			0
