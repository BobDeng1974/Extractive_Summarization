by @entity0 for @entity1 this is the moment a young elephant was sent flying after unwisely attempting to intimidate a huge buffalo bull			2
the over-confident calf was among a herd of elephants refreshing themselves at the @entity8 in @entity9 , @entity10 when the mature buffalo walked towards the water to join them			1
while the adult elephants seemingly paid little attention to their new drinking partner , the calf was clearly put out by his presence - charging towards him in the bizarre hope that his tiny frame would somehow scare the massive buffalo into leaving the area			0
needless to say , the bull was n't intimidated in the slightest and casually waited until the young elephant was within striking range before shoving him with his huge horned head			0
the poor calf was thrown several feet into the air before crashing back down on to the @entity10 savanna			0
the whole sorry incident , which took place in march this year , was caught on camera by local wildlife guide @entity35			0
mr @entity35 said that although the calf 's pride was undoubtedly hurt , he escaped physical injury and spent the rest of the day hiding behind his mother			1
' what surprised me was that the other elephants were in no way disturbed by the chain of events , but rather seemed to see it as a life lesson that the youngster had to learn , ' mr @entity35 said			0
as the unlikely enemies came together , the young elephant 's body twisted in a painful - looking way before he wound up in an embarrassing pile on the grass ouch : the young elephant ends up in a heap on the floor after his unwise decision to start a fight with a mature buffalo more than twice his size			1
the whole sorry incident , which took place in march this year , was caught on camera by local wildlife guide @entity35 lucky : wildlife guide @entity35 said that although the calf 's pride was undoubtedly hurt , his thick skull and sturdy body ensured he escaped serious physical injury aftermath : the bull buffalo continued to hang around in the area after the distinctly one - sided fight , completely unfazed by the presence of the young calf 's herd			1
for their part the elephants also showed little interest in the dispute - almost as if they had shrugged off the calf 's unwise attempt at intimidation as a valuable life lesson			2
