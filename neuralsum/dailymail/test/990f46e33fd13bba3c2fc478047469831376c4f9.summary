@entity0 has opened a real can of worms by ordering the final 18 seconds of the @entity3 's under 19 championship qualifier between @entity4 and @entity5 to be replayed following a refereeing error			1
however , @entity7 did something similar during a 2006 @entity10 qualifier			1
back in 2005 @entity11 were playing @entity12 in the @entity14 zone fourth - round play - off first leg when @entity17 referee @entity16 incorrectly awarded an indirect free - kick to @entity12 after the @entity19 had encroached at their penalty kick when 1 - 0 up			1
this happened in the 38th minute and @entity7 ordered that the entire match be replayed which did not please either team			1
@entity4 are awarded a penalty during their @entity27 qualifier in @entity28 referee @entity29 points to the spot as @entity4 are awarded a penalty in the 96th minute @entity32 steps up to take a penalty in the closing stages of the match against @entity5 @entity32 runs forward to strike the ball but team - mate @entity37 ( circled ) has entered the box @entity32 turns and celebrates as she slots the ball into the goalkeeper 's bottom - right corner @entity12 players and staff celebrate after beating @entity11 in a 2006 @entity10 qualifier on away goals have @entity0 just triggered a landmark moment for football ? final 18 seconds of @entity4 match to be replayed after ref disallowed penalty for encroachment ... and gave indirect free - kick instead			1
@entity11 only managed a 1 - 1 draw in the replay and a 0 - 0 scoreline in the second leg in @entity57 meant that @entity12 qualified			2
current @entity7 head of refereeing , @entity60 , was in charge for the first - leg rematch and i was appointed to the second leg in @entity12			0
it was surprising to receive four or five calls on the day of that game from @entity7 stressing how important it was that the game passed without any errors in law which would provoke another appeal			0
winding forward to the latest incident which was caused , incredibly , by an identical error by @entity77 referee , @entity29 , in the 96th minute of @entity4 ’s 2 - 1 ' defeat ' by @entity5 in their qualifying group			2
@entity4 thought they had scored an equaliser in the dying seconds of the game from the penalty spot but @entity29 had spotted encroachment by at least one @entity4 player and rightly disallowed the goal			2
had the penalty been missed she would have been correct to award an indirect free kick but as it had been scored she should have ordered a retake			1
@entity4 players celebrate after they thought they had equalised against @entity5 but referee @entity29 awards an indirect free - kick and the celebrations are cut short @entity32 has the ball back in her hands ready for what she thought would be a retake but @entity32 then realises the referee 's decision and two @entity101 players are seen celebrating @entity77 referee @entity29 incorrectly awarded an indirect free kick after disallowing a penalty @entity29 has been sent home from the @entity3 's u19 qualifiers after her mistake now , @entity0 has upheld @entity4 ’s appeal and ordered that in an evolution of the @entity7 decision in 2005 , the game should be replayed from the moment the technical error occurred			1
this bizarre decision was perhaps influenced by the fact that both teams are still present in the host city , @entity28 , and are available following their final qualifying matches			0
however , this sets a dangerous precedent			0
if the same error is made in the opening minutes of a late group match in next year ’s @entity123 finals in @entity124 , will that match be replayed and the schedule of the whole tournament be thrown into disarray ? i almost caused just that at @entity130 ; my error , in not sending @entity132 off when showing him his second yellow card , could not be disputed and given @entity7 ’s decision in the qualifying stages of the same competition they would have struggled not to allow a rematch			0
the game was 2 - 2 at the time of the mistake and it stayed that way until the final whistle but had @entity143 scored they would have ‘ qualified ’			0
i remember being told by the @entity145 that had @entity143 scored a winning goal in the final three or four minutes they would have appealed and expected a rematch at the very least			0
precedent set ; now let ’s wait for the next refereeing error			0
it will happen – and @entity0 must just hope it does n’t affect one of their premiere tournaments			1
referee @entity157 shows a yellow card to @entity143 's @entity132 during a 2006 @entity10 match poll sends @entity132 off but only after he had failed to show a red card after a second booking			2

@entity0 have ordered the final 18 seconds of the @entity3 's @entity164 between @entity4 and @entity5 to be replayed
referee @entity29 incorrectly awarded an indirect free kick after disallowing an @entity4 penalty for encroachment
@entity7 did something similar during a 2006 @entity10 qualifier
but the entire match between @entity11 and @entity12 was replayed
@entity0 must hope it does *n't* affect one of their premiere tournaments
