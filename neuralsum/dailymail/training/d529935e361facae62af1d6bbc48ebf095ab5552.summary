by @entity0 published : 12:34 est , 22 may 2013 updated : 12:35 est , 22 may 2013 the parents of a baby boy are pleading for thieves to return the silver box they stole , which contains his ashes			1
the @entity7 couple are distraught at the theft of the box containing their last link to the stillborn son			1
@entity13 and @entity15 's only child , @entity14 , was stillborn in 2008			1
since his death , the couple have struggled to become pregnant again			1
treasured memories : @entity13 and @entity15 kept the ashes of their baby son in a small silver box ' we spent some time with him before we let him go , and then had him cremated , ' mr @entity15 told @entity24			1
' i realize there are people in @entity28 going through more than us right now , but for us , it 's a personal hell			1
' since his death , the couple have kept their son 's ashes in a silver box , engraved with an angel and ' @entity37 , october 16 , 2008 '			1
but when mrs @entity39 returned from work on monday , she found a second - floor window had been smashed - and the box had been stolen			1
' he is only our only son , ' mr @entity15 said			2
' it 's devastating for both of us			1
but for my wife , this is everything			2
she ca n't have the future she wants , and now she does n't have a way to hold on to the past			2
' the box was kept on a dresser in their bedroom , until thieves broke into the couple 's home in @entity59 while they were at work on monday and stole it			1
' they were looking for small , valuable stuff , ' mr @entity15 said			2
as well as the box , an @entity64 , handgun and jewellery were taken			2
' what they took from us has absolutely no value whatsoever to them , ' he added			0
' i would ask that they just simply call the police and turn it in			0
and if the person who actually stole it wants to give it back , they can drive by my house at 3am and throw it in a garbage bag in my front yard			0
whatever it takes for them to feel comfortable giving us our son back			0
' appeal : @entity39 is desperate for the box containing his baby son 's ashes to be returned the 4in by 4in silver box may have been mistaken as a jewellery box , the couple say			1
' they may not have even realized what was in there			0
and they may have simply thought , " that 's a nice looking box , there 's probably some expensive jewelry in there " , ' mr @entity15 added			1
@entity105 , a grief counselor and founder of @entity109 - based @entity108 for grieving families , said parents mourn stillborn babies as they would any child			1
' when a baby dies during or shortly after birth , you have very few tangible mementos			2
so while , of course , this would be horrid for anyone , for this family , this is one of the very few things they have that belongs to their baby , ' ms @entity105 , who lost her daughter @entity129 before she was born , said			2
for a developed country , the @entity130 has a relatively high rate of stillbirths			0
about one in every 160 pregnancies in the @entity130 ends in a stillbirth , which is about 26,000 each year nationwide			0
the tragic end to a pregnancy is ' really a very emotional event , ' for health professionals as well as the baby 's family , @entity137 , a professor of maternal and fetal medicine at the @entity139 , told @entity146			1
when a couple loses a baby this way , hospitals will encourage them to spend time with their baby and to take pictures to help them remember their lost child			1
@entity14 was the @entity15 's only child			2
' we 've struggled with infertility for about four or five years now , and we 've not been able to have children , other than the one			0
and he was born prematurely			0
we lost him at birth			0
' mr @entity15 told @entity161			0
as he choked back tears , mr @entity15 added : ' so he is , to us , he is our only son			0
and it 's very important we get him back			2
' break in : @entity39 stands by the window thieves broke to get into the couple 's @entity7 home the couple say the box brought them a comfort that can not be replaced			1
' my wife said , " i wanted to be buried with him so i could be with him forever " , ' mr @entity15 said			0
' i just hope that somehow word gets out and that someone is willing to do something about it			0
' it is a sentiment echoed by other grieving parents who have ashes stolen from their homes			1
in january , a mother from @entity182 , @entity183 , pleaded for the return of a pink urn containing the ashes of her stillborn daughter			1
@entity188 had been pregnant with twins when one of the babies , @entity192 , died			0
the other twin survived and is now eight years old			0
' i already lost her one time			0
this is like losing her a second time , ' ms @entity188 told @entity197			0
anyone with information about the theft should call ( 770 ) 499 - 4184 and quote case number 13 - 052156 .			0
