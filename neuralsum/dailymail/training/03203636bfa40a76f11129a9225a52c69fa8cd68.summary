by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor home secretary @entity2 warned the health of democratic politics would be undermined if the @entity5 squeezes out local competition the @entity5 is ‘ destroying ’ local newspapers by using its taxpayer - funded dominance to squeeze out competition , @entity2 has warned			1
the home secretary condemned the @entity5 for using the licence fee to fund websites in direct competition with regional and national newspapers			1
and she warned that as papers close , fewer sources of news will become ‘ dangerous to the health of democratic politics ’			1
mrs may is the latest senior @entity20 to publicly criticise the @entity5 , stepping up pressure on the corporation over its management and spending			1
she said local newspapers are having ‘ a particularly hard time ’ , which is being made worse by the ‘ @entity5 's dominant position on the internet and its ability to subsidise the provision of internet news using the licence fee ’			1
‘ this makes it enormously difficult for local newspapers to compete			0
if the @entity5 can , as they do , provide all the locally significant news , what is left to motivate the local media to buy a paper ? ‘ it 's destroying local newspapers and could eventually happen to national newspapers as well			1
’ speaking to the @entity43 ' annual conference in @entity44 , mrs may warned : ‘ this is as dangerous for local politics as it is for local journalism			2
‘ because as a local mp i value the ability to raise issues in my constituency in my local newspaper but also i value its role in disseminating information about what i and local councillors are doing in the area			0
’ she added : ‘ this is a debate that wo n't go away and i believe the @entity5 has to think carefully about its presence locally and the impact it has on local democracy			2
’ mrs may said she believed ‘ a plurality of news sources is essential to our democracy ’			0
she warned if newspapers are forced to close down , the country could be left with a single source of information			0
the home secretary said : ‘ at a national level , we have a healthy number of competing newspapers in @entity78 and that 's something we surely do n't want to lose			1
’ hq : the @entity80 have stepped up criticism against the @entity5 over its culture , management and spending mrs may went on : ‘ a monopoly on the provision of information would be a perennial temptation to malpractice , inefficiency and corruption in exactly the same way almost every other kind of monopoly is			2
‘ no single source of news can possibly represent the variety of opinion that there is in this country and a monopoly news provider would be far too easily captured by special interests			0
‘ so competition in the provision of news is essential to democracy and diminishing competition is dangerous to the health of democratic politics			1
‘ that 's why it 's important that the internet does not have the effect of making a plurality of newspapers commercially impossible in @entity78			0
’ mrs may is the second senior @entity20 in as many weeks to draw attention to @entity5 's role in the political process after party chairman @entity118 accused the corporation of biased reporting and questioned its funding			2
he warned that the television licence fee could be cut unless the @entity5 tackles a ' culture ' of secrecy , waste and bias			0
mr @entity118 said @entity127 must rebuild confidence following the @entity129 and @entity131 abuse scandals , controversy over fat cat salaries and pay - offs to stars and senior executives .			0
