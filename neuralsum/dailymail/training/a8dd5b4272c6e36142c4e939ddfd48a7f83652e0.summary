the father - of - two was left out of breath and with aches and pains all over after being asked to help out with the lifting and tumbling			2
he was horrified at how out of shape he was , so agreed to become the only male member of the @entity19 troupe in @entity20 near @entity21 , @entity22 , thinking it could be a great way to shift some pounds and get fit			1
he said : ' the lads at work give me stick all the time , but i do n’t care			2
it ’s fun plus there 's the health aspect too			1
i 've lost three stone and i put a lot of that down to the cheerleading and eating healthier			1
