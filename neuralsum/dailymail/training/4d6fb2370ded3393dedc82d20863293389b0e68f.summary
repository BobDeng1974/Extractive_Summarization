by @entity0 @entity1 : 21:22 est , 16 december 2013 @entity2 : 04:41 est , 17 december 2013 @entity4 scientists have discovered artificial sweeteners in water samples collected from the @entity7 in @entity8			1
the sweeteners - found in everything from diet soda to flavored yoghurts - pass through waste - water treatment systems and are then discharged into waterways			2
in other words : humans consume them , expel them , and they wind up in our waterways			0
sweet nothings : artificial sweeteners are used in low - calorie foods and sodas as a sugar alternative but they persist through sewage treatment and wind up in rivers and waterways the researchers write in a paper published on @entity30 that the sweeteners got into the @entity7 from the 30 sewage treatment plants that empty into the river and its tributaries			1
the researchers , from @entity36 and the @entity37 sampled the @entity7 at 23 separate locations along more than 150 miles of its course			0
they found concentrations of four sweeteners : cyclamate , saccarin , sucralose and acesulfame , the last of which is particularly resistant to removal			2
the scientists say its very persistance and the fact that it comes solely from human waste makes acesulfame a good candidate for tracing the movement of treated sewage after it is expelled into rivers and waterways			2
the @entity7 : the large river in @entity8 , @entity4 , is impacted by agricultural activities and urban centers ' given the persistent nature demonstrated here and solely human source , we expect that acesulfame will become the most reliable detector of wastewater presence , dilution , and transformation in surface and ground waters , ' write the researchers			1
the researchers write that the concentrations they measured for sucralose , cyclamate , and saccharin are the ' highest reported concentrations of these compounds in surface waters anywhere in the world			0
' and acesulfame persists at elevated concentrations over a distance of 300km			0
having survived the sewage treatment plants , the compounds also persisted through water purification to be found in trace amounts in municipal tap water from homes that draw water from the @entity89			1
traceable : the persistence of artificial sweeteners means they 're a good way to trace where waste water ends up the researchers say the effects of artificial sweeteners on aquatic life are largely unknown			1
but , they write , ' we demonstrate here that aquatic organisms likely experience long - term exposure to significant concentrations ' of artificial sweeteners if they reside downriver from water impacted by urban activities			1
the report is just part of a growing body of evidence that the chemicals humans ingest - anti-depressants , sweeeteners , antibiotics and many other prescription drugs - wind up in our waterway and drinking supplies			0
so far , researchers are unsure of the longterm effects for humans and the environment are .			0

@entity4 scientists have found elevated levels of artificial sweeteners in the @entity89 , @entity8
the compounds have also been found in drinking water
the environmental impact of the sweeteners is as yet unkown
