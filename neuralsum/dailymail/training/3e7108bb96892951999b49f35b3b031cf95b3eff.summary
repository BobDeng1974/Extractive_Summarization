for more than 100 years , a humble brick bridge stood in this quiet @entity2 village			1
now that peace is shattered - after the railway crossing was replaced with a lurid green ' tin can '			1
villagers are furious with @entity7 , which tore down the structure over the @entity9 and built one four inches higher to leave room for overhead electric wires			1
before : this humble brick bridge stood over the @entity9 in @entity12 for more than a century after : @entity7 had to raise the bridge by four inches - so replaced it with this bolt - ridden lurid ' tin can ' a main road out of @entity16 , @entity12 , which has 1,300 residents and claims to be @entity19 's longest village , was closed for three and a half months while the bridge was installed			1
it finally re-opened just before @entity21 , but residents were none the wiser about the design because work continued under weatherproof covers			1
by the time the green , bolt - ridden metal facade was unveiled , it was too late			0
' it 's an eyesore			1
it 's a hideous thing , ' said villager @entity31 , 74			1
' it 's a real monstrosity			2
' it is not at all what we expected			0
the work started in december and they 've been doing it for a couple of months now			0
' they 've had it covered up the whole time they were doing the work so nobody knew it was coming			0
' they just took down the covers and there it was , we could n't even do anything about it because it was already done			0
horror : residents said they were unaware of the ' monstrosity ' taking shape because it was built under covers one resident said : ' the look just does n't fit , it just does not fit comfortable in this rural area ' ' it was such a shock when it was revealed , it 's like a giant tin can			1
it really ruins the look of our nice little village			1
' another local , who asked to remain anonymous , said : ' basically it 's an absolute eyesore and a travesty that it 's been built to this kind of design			1
' this is a small rural rural village			2
ok , you can imagine and understand that things have to change and progress but what they 've actually put up is a joke			0
' i mean it looks like a rotten tin can			2
the look just does n't fit , it just does not fit comfortable in this rural area			2
' the old bridge was built over the new @entity84 to @entity86 spur of the @entity9 which opened to trains in 1903 , two years after the death of @entity90 @entity89			1
fuming : @entity31 , 74 , is one of the 1,300 residents in @entity16 , the longest village in @entity19 at six miles mr @entity31 said : ' it 's an eyesore			1
it 's a hideous thing			2
it 's a real monstrosity			2
it is not at all what we expected ' it was a feat of engineering in its day , slashing the travel time from @entity101 to south @entity102 , but is now undergoing the most dramatic upgrade in its history			0
diesel trains still run on the line so rail bosses are electrifying the entire route - but the £ 500million cost is spiralling according to @entity110 , who claimed in october it had reached £ 1.6billion			0
for efficiency reasons , and because an @entity114 directive says new lines must be able to take @entity117 trains , @entity7 is installing overhead electric wires instead of an electrified ' third rail '			0
that means several bridges over the ageing line are too low and have to be replaced			0
a @entity7 spokesman said officials do not know how much the bridge cost because contractors were paid for a series of bridges in one deal			0
eyesore : the bridge is part of a multi-million pound scheme to electrify the line between @entity101 and @entity86 @entity135 : @entity7 apologised for the look of the bridge but said it had to save taxpayers ' money but she added : ' we are sorry to hear that some residents do not find the bridge at @entity144 aesthetically pleasing			1
' this bridge required essential work to prepare it for electrification and the arrival of a new fleet of faster , longer , quieter and greener electric trains			0
' as a public funded organisation , we must balance our duty to preserve the heritage of the railway with the best use of taxpayers ' money			0
' now this bridge is reopen , people and businesses in the area are a step closer to seeing the benefits that electrification and the new electric trains will bring			0

brick bridge stood over @entity9 for more than 100 years
but its level had to be raised by 4 inches to fit new overhead power line
appalled residents of @entity16 , @entity12 , found ' tin can ' in its place
' it 's an eyesore , ' said @entity31 , 74 . ' it ruins the look of our little village '
