@entity1 's voice came over the radio in a panting rasp as he sat inside the cockpit of his crippled @entity5 after a 165mph crash that bruised not only knees , ankles and back but his world championship dream			1
‘ i put my foot on the pedal and something failed , ’ he wheezed , seemingly winded by the impact during qualifying for today ’s @entity12 @entity11			2
it was at @entity17 , the 13th corner at @entity19 , that a broken disc in his front right wheel sent his car careering across the gravel and sideways into the tyre wall			2
@entity63 @entity62 he had completed just five laps , condemning him to 16th place , and possibly to starting in the pit lane once his car has been restored , when he should have contested pole			0
his only true rival for the prime front - row position was @entity5 team - mate @entity71 , who ended up setting the fastest time of the day by sixth - tenths of a second			1
@entity39 and @entity40 , both of @entity75 , start second and third			1
@entity1 was taken to the medical centre for tests while his car was lifted by hoist onto a truck and covered in a black cloth , his hopes of narrowing the four - point deficit to @entity71 at the top of the drivers ’ standings badly damaged			1
at the paddock , @entity1 said : ‘ @entity71 has basically got another gift , but we will see what we can do tomorrow			1
’ ‘ why always me ? ’ he might have added , a la @entity89			0
the hard fact is that @entity71 has out - qualified @entity1 6 - 4 , an extraordinary statistic given the @entity93 ’s reputation as a one - lap specialist			1
however , there is no evidence to underpin the @entity98 morons claiming within minutes of the accident that @entity1 is suffering at the hands of @entity102 saboteurs in the team			2
precautionary : @entity1 went to the medical centre for a check - up following the crash setting the pace : @entity71 recorded the fastest lap at the end of the first qualifying session point of impact : @entity1 sits stunned following his crash in @entity19 check up : @entity1 gets into the medical car following his high - speed crash in qualifying the conspiracy theorists might consider whether @entity118 , the @entity5 chairman , brought @entity1 in at great expense to help them win the title only to bring him down			1
this was @entity1 ’s second technical misfortune of the season			2
the other was an engine failure in @entity127			0
@entity71 has suffered one , a gearbox problem at @entity130 a fortnight ago			2
( although @entity1 retired from the @entity131 @entity11 , that was partly because he failed to manage overheating brakes as well as @entity71 , who , despite being plagued by the same affliction , nursed his car through to second place			1
) @entity71 waved his black and turquoise glove at the thinly - populated stands as he turned into the pits on this scorching day in the @entity142 woods			2
he was happy to have taken pole in front of his home fans , but not as ecstatic as he has been on other such occasions			2
‘ i would have preferred it if it was an open fight with @entity1 , ’ said the @entity12			1
while sitting at his press conference , he watched @entity1 ’s crash for the first time on the tv			0
‘ it looked pretty bad , but i believe he is just a little bit bruised , ’ said @entity71 , who also explained that he uses different front brake discs from @entity1 ( @entity153 rather than @entity154 , since you ask )			1
all smiles : @entity71 waves to his home crowd after securing pole at @entity163 he was asked by a @entity165 journalist whether he was half of the first all - @entity165 front row			1
his father is @entity165 ’s 1982 world champion @entity169 , though he competes under the flag of his mother , @entity171			0
‘ yes , i agree , ’ he smiled			0
he later changed his mind , saying : ‘ i am half @entity165 so there are one - and - a - half @entity165 on the podium and that is a record , too			0
’ @entity1 was understandably less jovial , but no less determined			0
‘ it was n’t a great feeling when that happened , you just have to take your hands off the wheel and brace for the impact			0
i have felt better , but thankfully i ’m ok , ’ he said			0
‘ we did n’t even get to do five laps			0
i ’m not sure where we ’ll start tomorrow in the race because that will depend on the damage to the car			0
but we ’ll give it everything , hope for a slice of luck and aim for a recovery			0
i wo n’t be giving up			0
’ elsewhere @entity50 ( 11th ) was outgunned by his @entity51 team - mate @entity196 ( fourth ) while @entity42 ( fifth ) beat @entity43 team - mate @entity44 for the seventh time in qualifying			1
@entity1 will have to summon all his spirit as a born racer and probably needs to rely on @entity71 suffering a glitch if he is to win			1
‘ you ’d have to be smoking something to think i can beat @entity71 , ’ he said , smiling thinly			0
job done : @entity71 will start on pole ahead of the @entity75 duo of @entity207 ( right ) and @entity40 contrasting fortunes : @entity71 drives past @entity1 after the @entity93 slammed his mercedes into the barriers			1

@entity1 suffered brake failure in opening session and crashed at 165mph
he headed to medical centre but was released and is back in the paddock
@entity93 will start only 15th for tomorrow 's grand prix at @entity19
@entity1 is four points *adrift* of team - mate @entity71 in drivers ' championship
@entity71 secured his fourth pole in five races with @entity39 2nd , @entity40 3rd
@entity1 has won in @entity12 on two previous occasions in 2008 and 2011
