opponents of @entity2 ' plan to build a museum along @entity5 's lakefront have filed a lawsuit branding it an ' assault on the shores of @entity9 '			1
it is the latest obstacle for the @entity13 creator 's @entity11 , a shrine his collection of art and movie memorabilia , after negotiations over a waterfront site fell through with @entity20			1
the federal lawsuit filed on thursday by @entity5 advocacy group @entity22 argues that the city has no authority to hand over the land , citing a legal principle known as the public trust doctrine			1
projection : this is an architectural rendering of the @entity11 that @entity2 plans to build along @entity5 's lakefront			1
however , he is now facing legal action branding it an assault on the shore that doctrine makes the state a trustee over natural resources and requires it to ensure open spaces are preserved and accessible to the public			1
