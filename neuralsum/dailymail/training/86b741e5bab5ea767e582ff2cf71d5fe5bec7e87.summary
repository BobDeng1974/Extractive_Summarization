by @entity0 she was the butter - would n't - melt star of hit kids ' comedy show @entity4			1
but it seems that @entity7 's out of office activities may have led to the unfortunate early end of the @entity11 programme			2
production on the show has reportedly stopped and it is unlikely to be renewed for a second season following selfies of @entity7 , 21 , wearing just her underwear being leaked on the internet			1
but there are also claims that the show has not been renewed because @entity7 , who skipped the @entity22 last weekend , has fallen out with the network over pay - and is upset that her co-star @entity25 earns ' way more ' than her , @entity24 reported			1
not so innocent : @entity7 , the star of @entity26 's @entity4 , right , was left red - faced when photos of her in her underwear , left , were leaked online			1
the show has not been renewed for a second season ' the photos caused no issues and we have the utmost respect for her ' : the network denies that the leaked racy pics are behind the production hiatus , while the star herself insists her unhappiness stems from @entity11 's ' treatment ' of her @entity43 claim that the fact there has been no announcement about the renewal of the show for a second season is incredibly unusual considering the immense success of the 40 - episode first series			1
the scandal began last month , when the images of @entity7 in a bra and thong hit the web after she publicly slammed @entity59 player beau @entity58 for being a bad kisser			2
however , despite @entity7 insisting she only sent the images to one person , @entity58 has insisted that he was n't responsible for the leak			0
when @entity7 failed to attend the @entity22 , despite being nominated for favorite tv actress , over the weekend , rumours of trouble between the young star and the tv network continued to spread			1
@entity7 posted a lengthy message on her @entity71 page in an attempt to explain her absence from the red carpet awards to her fans , writing : ' a lot of you guys are asking why i did nâ€™t attend the @entity80			0
scandal - hit : 21 - year - old @entity7 shares her own scantily - clad images on her @entity83 and @entity71 pages star : @entity7 is on the show with @entity25 , right , with whom she has reportedly been feuding with ' i wish i could explain everything as thoroughly as i would like to , but unfortunately a simpler explanation is all i can write			1
i was put in an uncomfortable , compromising , unfair situation ( many of you have guessed what it is ) and i had to look out for me			0
' making reference to a reported feud between herself and co-star @entity25 , @entity7 continued : ' i chose to not go because sticking up for what is right and what is fair is what my mom taught me is always the most important thing			1
' i want to thank those of you who have reached out with kind words of support , @entity105 and @entity106 alike			0
no matter who or what you support , i believe in supporting fairness first			0
if you have done that , thank you			0
' she then added : ' my previous tweet has nothing to do with pics leaked.oh you guys lol			0
it has to do with how nickelodeon treated me			0
' knock - on effect : despite being the highest - rated show on the network , extended from 20 to 40 episodes just one month into its first run , the series is yet to be renewed for a second season following the scandal staying at home : @entity7 , who shared these images on @entity83 , said her absence from @entity22 last weekend had nothing to do with the leaked photographs the way they were : while it 's been reported that the discord between the friends is nothing personal , @entity7 's decision to ditch her pal at the awards show on the weekend suggests otherwise and a spokesperson for @entity11 told the @entity145 reiterated that the pictures were not to blame for any ' feud ' between them and @entity7			1
a statement read : ' the photos caused no issues between @entity7 and the network , and we have the utmost respect for her			2
' and of the claims that the show has wrapped early , officials said : ' we are wrapping up what was an unusually long production cycle of @entity4 , and everyone is understandably tired			0
' we are going into our production hiatus next week which will give everyone on the show a much needed rest			0
' in the series , which took home the @entity168 award at the ceremony , @entity7 and @entity25 , aka @entity4 , are roommates who also run a childminding company .			2

photos of the 21 - year - old @entity11 star posing in her underwear were leaked on the internet last month
they emerged after she publicly criticized her *ex-boyfriend* 's kissing
@entity4 has yet to be renewed for a second season despite its success
@entity7 missed the @entity22 at the weekend and said it was because of how she had been treated by the channel
reports claim that she has fallen out with them over money because her co-star @entity25 gets paid ' way more ' than she does
