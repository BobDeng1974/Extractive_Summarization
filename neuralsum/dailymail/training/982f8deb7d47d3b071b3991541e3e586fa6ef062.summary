sir @entity0 has confirmed he and his son @entity1 will be the first passengers on a commercial flight into space in spring 2015			1
' i would very much hope that before @entity10 , @entity8 has visited space , ' the @entity6 billionaire and head of @entity8 said			2
' and then we 'll move the whole program to @entity13 where myself and my son will be the first people to go up from the @entity16 in the spring of next year			1
as well as voters in the deprived region of having to agree to pay ' special taxes ' to fund the project since its inception back in 2005 , the promise of 700 flights a year by 2015 , with two flights out a day , has failed to materialise			2
@entity13 's hope that it would be spearheading a new technological age remains a distant dream , despite @entity0 's latest newscast			1
according to @entity42 , a grand total of ten jobs have so far actually been created on the site for local residents			0
that ’s 0.33 per cent of the number that was originally promised			0
and works out at £ 13.85 million per job			0
@entity48 , right , pictured in conversation with @entity50 , will assist his father @entity51 into space in 2015 @entity0 was speaking at an event at the @entity54 in @entity55 in conjuction with @entity58 vodka , a sponsor for @entity8 's world - first passenger flight into space			1
seats on the flights into space are already being snapped up for the princely sum of £ 250,000 ahead of the spring launch at @entity24 in @entity13			1
however , sir @entity51 is facing a ‘ backlash ’ from some of the nearly 700 passengers who have already paid for a ticket on the craft			0
some stumped up the fee as long ago as 2005 , but still have no idea when they will eventually reach space			0
the 600 - plus takers for the flights are already benefiting from their ticket purchase , which by extension enters them into an exclusive club that has seen them visit @entity81 and the @entity82 with @entity0 along with undertaking g - force training			2
the @entity84 makes its third successful test flight from the @entity82			0

sir @entity0 says he and son @entity1 will be @entity8 's first passengers when they set off on the first commercial flight into space
the launch is scheduled for spring 2015 from their *spaceport* in @entity13
seats cost £ 250,000 and more than 600 have been bought so far
but project is already six years behind original schedule
