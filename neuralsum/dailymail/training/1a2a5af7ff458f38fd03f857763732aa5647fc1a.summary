@entity5 bought a pair of £ 10 ' cat 's eyes ' lenses to wear to a party last weekend			1
but when it came to the end of the night , the 42 - year - old could not get them out			1
over the course of seven hours , the lenses had stuck fast to both her eyes			1
@entity5 bought a pair of £ 10 ' cat 's eyes ' lenses ( pictured ) to wear to a @entity21 last weekend helped by her partner , @entity22 , from @entity23 , eventually managed to remove lenses after an hour and a half , but was in such agony she had to go to hospital			1
there , a consultant confirmed the lenses had fused to her eye and removing them had damaged the top lining to the cornea - the clear later that covers the front of the eye			1
miss @entity5 , who works at a primary school , said : ' the doctors told me the lenses had ripped or damaged the top lining to the cornea			1
' i was shown the damage on a chart and the consultant said it was quite bad			0
' she had bought the lenses from a local fancy dress shop to go with her zombie schoolgirl @entity3 costume			1
describing the ordeal of trying to remove them , she said : ' it felt like someone was pouring bleach into my eyes			1
' i 've never felt pain like it			2
i was screaming - it was absolutely horrific , like stabbing pains			2
' i went into the bathroom and splashed water on my eyes			2
then my partner got me some eye wash from @entity65 but that was excruciating , too			2
' after being diagnosed in hospital she was prescribed pain relief , a lubricant gel to moisten the eye and drops to dilate her pupils to improve her vision			0
her partner escorted her from the hospital with her eyes still closed from the pain			0
but at the end of the night , the 42 - year - old could not get the lenses out , as they had ' fused ' to her eyeballs doctors confirmed removing the lenses had damaged the top lining of her cornea - the clear layer that covers the front of the eye			1

dr @entity117 , a consultant eye surgeon , said he is concerned that people are risking severe health consequences by using novelty lenses			2
' decorative contact lenses need to be treated in the same way as prescription contact lenses , with thorough guidance on how to put them in and follow up care			0
contact lenses should only be fitted by a optometrist who measures each eye to fit the lenses and checks how the eyes respond , he said			1

' she went to bed when she get home but had to wake every four hours to prise her eyes open to apply drops and ointment			0
miss @entity5 , who also had to wear sunglasses to keep her eyes rested , said : ' everything was a bit blurry the next morning			1
bright lights are sore because the pupils are dilated			0
' she said the damage now seemed to be healing but said : ' it was very frightening			0
i could n't see the eye chart the consultant was showing me			2
' she has also been off work since the incident and says her sight is so blurry she can not read the time on her kitchen clock			2

she said : ' i got the right lens out ok , but when it came to the left one it was like there was no liquid in my eye at all			0

there was nothing to grab onto , there was no edge			0
