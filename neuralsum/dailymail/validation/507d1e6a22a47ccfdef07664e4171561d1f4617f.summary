the 2015 @entity1 season begins with sunday ’s @entity3 card at @entity4			2
@entity5 answers some intriguing questions			2
can @entity7 finally regain the ‘ fear factor ’ ? only one @entity10 winner in 2014 — @entity11 in the @entity12 at @entity13 — was an unacceptably thin return for @entity16 ’s lavishly - funded @entity7 operation			1
@entity17 ’ @entity18 among seven of @entity20 's horses in the first nine in the ante - post betting for @entity22 @entity11 ’s trainer @entity29 was fully aware of the need to do better when he said in october : ‘ ten years ago , we were at the top of the table and everyone was frightened of us			1
that ’s where we will hopefully be again in a year or two			0
’ the organisation , badly tarnished by the 2013 @entity33 drug scandal , has seen significant changes , with horses now spread beyond the @entity29 - @entity37 twin @entity13 operation			1
horses will race in the @entity7 colours from the stables of @entity42 and @entity43 in @entity44 , @entity45 in @entity46 and @entity47 in @entity48 while they have acquired @entity50 ’s 2014 2,000 @entity49 and a share in @entity54 ’s @entity53 scorer @entity52			1
top jockeys @entity56 and @entity57 have been recruited and the @entity16 spent another fortune on yearling talent			1
@entity29 has cleaned up on this winter ’s all - weather circuit but , given his ammunition , at times that has seemed like pitting @entity64 against a third @entity66 batsman			2
the serious stuff is ahead for an organisation that has not punched its weight			0
top jockey @entity56 has been recruited by @entity7 is the @entity71 juggernaut unstoppable ? they may lag behind the horse numbers of @entity76 ’s @entity75 family but sheik @entity78 ’s @entity77 now have almost 250 horses while sheik @entity80 , who retains @entity81 , has doubled his @entity83 string to 150 , half of them based here			1
with the likes of @entity91 winner @entity89 and £ 800,000 buy @entity92 , who scooted home on his @entity96 debut in october , in their team , a first @entity87 win could arrive this summer			0
expensive new sponsorships will also be rolled out for the first time at @entity100 and @entity101 as the @entity71 influence spreads			0
is @entity20 nailed on for a fourth @entity22 ? when @entity104 followed up the @entity22 successes of @entity106 and @entity107 last june it was a historic @entity22 hat - trick for @entity109 ’s dominant trainer and a fourth successive victory looks highly likely			1
he already has a vice-like grip on this year ’s race with favourites @entity114 and @entity116 among seven of his horses in the first nine in the ante - post betting and @entity118 make it even money that an @entity20 horse wins the @entity22			1
jockeys title race likely to be the shootout between @entity123 and @entity124 ( right ) will @entity126 changes mean a new winner ? despite the marketing vandalism of shortening the title race from 2,000 guineas day at @entity13 on may 2 to @entity132 at @entity133 on october 17 , it is likely to be the same shootout between @entity123 and the defending champion @entity124 , who retires at the end of the season			1
but do not rule out a hungry @entity138 , freelancing and out to prove a point after being ditched by @entity7			1
@entity50 to be champion trainer again ? sheer weight of numbers would suggest so			0
@entity50 , with more than 250 horses in his care , has to be favourite			2
he has lost @entity144 and @entity145 to stud but closest rival @entity47 has waved goodbye to @entity149 and @entity150			0
both have a clutch of @entity87 hopes			0
@entity54 — with @entity155 winner and @entity157 fourth @entity156 plus 2,000 guineas hope @entity52 — could narrow the gap but it is a blow that injury means filly @entity162 misses the @entity158			0
a final classic win for @entity165 ? having retired in 2011 , @entity165 , 78 next month , took out his licence again when son @entity167 died last year			0
he retires again at the end of the season but is overseeing a string of almost 40 horses owned by @entity172			2
among them are 1,000 guineas hope @entity175 and 2,000 guineas hope @entity177 .			0

@entity179 has seven horses in first nine of ante - post betting for @entity22
