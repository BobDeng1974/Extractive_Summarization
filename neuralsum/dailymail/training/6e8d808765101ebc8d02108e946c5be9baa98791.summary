shoddy : @entity8 pleaded guilty to selling food not of the ' substance or quality required ' after an inch - long lump of metal was found baked into a pizza mr @entity8 was fined £ 1,000 and ordered to pay £ 750 in costs and a £ 100 victim surcharge for serving the pizza to an unsuspecting customer in december 2012			1
@entity16 council ’s cabinet member for @entity34 , councillor @entity35 said : ' selling shoddy products of any kind is not acceptable and is particularly important when preparing food			1
' mr @entity39 added : ' we will always prosecute and seek the highest possible fine to make sure that everyone maintains standards in their kitchens			2
' ' this was a cheap bolt that got someone an expensive fine and that should be a lesson to others			2
' standards : councillor @entity35 ' this was a cheap bolt that got someone an expensive fine and that should be a lesson to others ' there have been a number of incidents of foreign objects found in food in recent months			1
in november a plumber claimed he had been left unable to eat anything after discovering a dead mouse inside a bag of @entity68 frozen scampi			1
@entity69 , 37 , said he could only stomach fruit juice after finding the dead rodent inside his packet of seafood			1
he had poured the contents into a deep fat fryer for an afternoon snack , but then a couple of minutes later noticed something black floating in the hot oil			2
mr @entity69 , from @entity80 in @entity81 , said : ‘ i stuck my hand in the bag and put it in - i was in a hurry			0
' he says he spotted the dead mouse floating in the oil around two minutes later			0
earlier this year @entity88 , 27 , found a human tooth embedded in a pork and chive sausage from @entity68 ’s finest range			0
mr @entity88 , from @entity93 in @entity94 , had planned to use them to make sausage rolls for his birthday party , but abandoned the plans when his fiancée removed the packaging and found the tooth stuck in the side of a sausage			0
mr @entity69 found the dead mouse inside a £ 3 bag of @entity68 scampi			1
the 37 - year - old claimed the incident left him unable to consume anything other than fruit juice fried : the dead mouse was in hot oil along with the scampi for around two minutes before mr @entity69 noticed it and only last weekend , a @entity114 customer in @entity115 , @entity116 was shocked to discover a dead frog in her salad			2
the @entity120 employee had visited the branch on @entity122 to get what she assumed would be a regular @entity124			0
but in addition to the tomatoes , tuna , egg and olives , there was an extra ingredient : the small amphibian , almost camouflaged among the salad leaves			0
the manager of the branch has since apologised and given the customer a refund , plus a voucher for a free lunch			2
the heavy fine kebab shop owner mr @entity8 received for serving the bolt in his pizza is in stark contrast to the compensation @entity68 offered mr @entity88			1
@entity68 initially offered only an apology and a £ 15 voucher for what it insisted was a piece of bone			0
finally , after mr @entity88 protested further , the supermarket acknowledged that the unwelcome discovery was a tooth and added another £ 10			0
a @entity68 spokesman said : ‘ we are sorry for any upset			0
however , after a thorough investigation , we are confident the tooth was not inside the product when it arrived at the store			2
’ they added : ‘ all products undergo robust testing during the manufacturing process , including metal detection			0
the object in question is part metal and , during supplier tests , it was easily picked up by the metal detector			0
