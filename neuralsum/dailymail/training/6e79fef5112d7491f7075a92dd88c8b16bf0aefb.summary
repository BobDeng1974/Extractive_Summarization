the spread of @entity2 in @entity3 this summer stemmed from one traditional healer ’s funeral where 14 women were infected , experts have claimed			1
scientists have studied the blood of recent victims and believe the funeral , in mid-may might have acted as a ‘ super-spreader ’ event			1
they say this is comparable to a case in 2003 in a hotel in @entity15 where one doctor from @entity19 who had @entity16 infected nine other guests			0
these in turn spread the virus within the city and to other countries such as @entity25 and @entity26			2
this lies near @entity41 in neighbouring @entity33 where the outbreak is believed to have started in december			1
the newspaper reports that the healer was known for treating a ‘ mysterious illness ’ which then turned out to be @entity2			2
although this had already been the suspected cause , the @entity35 reports that it was confirmed by geneticists at the @entity49 of the @entity50 and @entity51			0
they are understood to have sequenced the virus found in 78 patients treated in the @entity31 in northern @entity3 close to the borders with @entity33 and @entity34			1
the research was published in the journal @entity58			0
the spread of @entity2 in @entity3 this summer stemmed from one traditional healer ’s funeral where 14 women were infected , experts have claimed the @entity35 reports dr @entity64 from @entity65 as saying : ‘ it ’s frightening that a single event could catalyse a whole outbreak , but that ’s what it looks like happened			1
he added that the research was a ‘ really nice piece of work ’			0
experts also discovered that the @entity75 strain of @entity2 was different from the one that has been circulating in @entity78 , thousands of miles away , since the mid 1970s			2
but the newspaper reports that the two ‘ probably diverged as far back as 2004 ’			0
the study ’s co-author dr @entity80 , a geneticist at @entity51 , said in that time it may have been circulating in forest animals including bats and apes			0
but she added that ‘ it could have been circulating in humans for 10 years with little or no notice			0
’ as of august 26 , 422 people have died of @entity2 in @entity3 while the outbreak has claimed the lives of 1,552 people across @entity75 scientists say the research is helpful as tests to diagnose @entity2 and vaccines being considered are based on the @entity98 strain			1
it means a current diagnostic test may not provide a clear positive if a patient had a ‘ low viral load ’ in the early stages of an infection , the newspaper reports			0
the news comes a day after it was revealed that @entity2 had spread to a fifth nation in @entity75			2
a case of the deadly virus has been reported in @entity111 , making it the first time a new country has been hit by the outbreak since july			2
as of august 26 , 1,552 people had been confirmed dead from @entity2 in four countries - @entity3 , @entity34 , @entity33 and @entity116			1
@entity34 was the worst affected with 694 deaths ; 422 people have died in @entity3 ; and 430 in @entity33 , where the virus emerged at the start of the year			1
@entity116 has now recorded six deaths .			0

experts believe spread of @entity2 in @entity3 came from one funeral
14 women infected at funeral for one traditional healer near @entity33 border
event may have acted as a ' super-spreader ' according to @entity134 scientists
funeral took place in @entity3 diamond mining community of @entity39
geneticists traced outbreak by sequencing virus in 78 *hospital* patients
