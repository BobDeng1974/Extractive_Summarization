technology : a study found that the majority of older workers did not believe better computer skills would help them in their current job a generation of older workers are risking redundancy and long - term unemployment because of poor technology skills , it is claimed			1
experts said training was ‘ heavily geared ’ towards young people , meaning many older workers were left behind in the workplace			1
this left them vulnerable when companies start ‘ shedding ’ jobs			1
while older generations often pride themselves on their numeracy and literacy skills , even these could ‘ go stale ’ with age , a study warned			2
the @entity24 ( @entity24 ) said research showed that over- 55s had the same literacy and numeracy skills as those aged 16 to 24 – and were worse at these skills than colleagues in their 30s and 40s			0
the @entity24 said the death of a ‘ job for life ’ meant workers could no longer rely on loyalty to their company and experience to take them through to retirement with the same employer			1
instead , older workers could not become complacent and must constantly ‘ reskill ’ and retrain to boost their job security , it said			1
in a new report on the value of training for older workers , it said : ‘ the old model of training in youth and a " career for life " thereafter no longer applies ’			1
a survey by the @entity24 found that , while people in their twenties , thirties and forties aspired to take a master ’s degree in the future or a vocational qualification , this stopped at 55 , when most respondents said they were unlikely to undertake a formal qualification			0
a third of over- 55s cited their age as the reason for not wanting to take a new qualification			0
the majority of older workers did not believe better computer skills would help them in their current job , while an astonishing one in 10 have never used a computer			2
but the @entity24 said the reality was they may have a ‘ lack of knowledge of what modern and technological tools there are available which could assist them carrying out their tasks ’			2
education : a third of over- 55s cited their age as the reason for not wanting to take a new qualification @entity87 , of the @entity24 , said : ‘ older generations are faced with the greatest barriers when it comes to reskilling			2
‘ given rapid economic and technological changes , many traditional jobs are less secure than in the past and older workers are increasingly facing the threat of redundancy			1
‘ the @entity98 ’s ageing population is growing and the increased retirement age means people are working for longer			0
‘ the challenge is therefore to ensure people can continue to participate in the labour market at the later stage of their working lives			0
’ according to the @entity107 , workers aged 55 and over are less likely to be unemployed than younger workers			0
but older unemployed people are more likely to have been out of work for 12 months or longer , suggesting they find it harder to find a new job if they do find themselves out of work			0
the accountancy body said older men were particularly vulnerable to job losses in the declining mining , agriculture and manufacturing industries , while women were heavily over-represented in the public sector so could face risks from cuts to civil servants .			0
