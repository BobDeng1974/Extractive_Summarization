by @entity0 published : 12:02 est , 19 march 2012 updated : 13:13 est , 19 march 2012 with its thatched cottages , @entity3 heritage and proud farming roots @entity1 in @entity7 's beautiful @entity6 valley is the quintessential @entity9 village			1
but residents say an @entity11 ' - more commonly used in inner cities - has smeared their image to help police tackle a minority of troublemakers			1
they have complained that the move will damage their formidable reputation - and send property prices tumbling			1
dispersal order : residents of @entity1 say a @entity11 ' - more commonly used in inner cities - has smeared their image not since the @entity3 first invaded has there been such outrage in the parish at the imposition of new rules			1
an influx of problem families into the village with a population of 1,905 has been blamed for a rise in anti-social behaviour			0
latest crime figures show the number of ' nuisance ' incidents in @entity1 more than trebled - from nine to 33 per year - between 2010 and the end of 2011			1
this is set against an overall 14 per cent reduction in anti-social behaviour across @entity43 's area over a similar period			0
police and council officials say the asbo will help tackle intimidation of residents , criminal damage and the pelting of houses with objects			2
@entity55 , 53 , landlady of the @entity56 , where 80 villagers packed a public meeting , said an influx of ' problem ' families had damaged their reputation			2
' we 're being used as a dumping ground for a couple of problem families who keep getting moved around council properties , ' she said			0
' the idea is that they are dispersed throughout the council area to dilute the effect they have			0
' but these families ' kids just end up dragging local kids into trouble			0
' her husband @entity77 , 56 , said : ' most @entity1 people think the dispersal zone is over the top			1
' picture postcard : homeowners have claimed that the ' asbo ' will ruin their villages reputation and send property prices plunging officers will have the power to order any group of two or more people ' causing , or likely to cause , anti-social behaviour ' to leave a dispersal zone - marked on village maps stuck to lamp posts			1
under 16s can be escorted back to their homes while parents may receive warning letters and ' acceptable behaviour ' contracts for their children			0
@entity102 , 40 , manager of the village 's @entity104 store , said : ' most customers are really angry about the dispersal order			2
' it damages the reputation of the village and people feel it is going to hit property prices			1
' @entity114 , who opened the @entity115 three months ago , said : ' friends have asked me ; " why open a shop there - that 's the @entity121 village			2
" ' neighbouring areas are getting the impression that this is a really bad place			0
' but that 's nonsense			0
i have n't heard one customer complain to me about anti-social behaviour			0
' the @entity128 , vicar of @entity1 's 15th century @entity127 of @entity129 , said the order , obtained by the @entity131 and @entity132 , was disproportionate			1
' until this order was publicised most people in the village were unaware there was even a problem , ' he said			2
the authority 's community safety officer , @entity137 , said the new police powers would target a ' small number of individuals who are responsible for the behaviour , or who are encouraging others to get involved			2
' sergeant @entity145 , of @entity7 and @entity146 , said the order would not affect anyone ' wishing to meet and go about normal day to day activities			0
' however many villagers remain unimpressed			0
retired @entity152 warrant officer @entity151 , 69 , moved to @entity1 last year from @entity153			1
' you see kids riding around on bmx bikes , wearing hoodies and making a noise , ' he said			0
' some of them probably have a few cans of lager			0
' but that does n't make @entity1 a troublespot			1
if you think otherwise , try living where i was in @entity153			1

one resident fumed : ' if you think @entity1 is a troublespot , try living where i did in @entity153 '
police given power to order people to disperse
homeowners fear their reputation will be *tarnished* - and property prices will *plummet*
