by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 no @entity2 means no trophy and no trophy means no escaping the nightmare which has haunted @entity6 for 64 years — ever since the last time they failed to win the @entity8 on home soil			1
that appeared to be the consensus as celebrations that followed a 2 - 1 win against @entity14 in a pulsating quarter - final were tinged with sadness			1
@entity2 ’s injury had swiftly been confirmed as a broken vertebra , an x-ray was broadcast on television to prove the point and president @entity22 took to social media to offer her best wishes for a speedy recovery			1
video : scroll down to watch videos of @entity2 after his @entity8 ending injury emotional : @entity29 hugs @entity2 as he waits to board an ambulance after friday 's win over @entity14 cynical : with the ball nowhere near @entity33 smashes his knee into the lower part of @entity2 's back agony : @entity2 clutches his back after going down injured during @entity6 's win over @entity14 on friday carried away : @entity2 was stretchered off the pitch and taken to hospital after @entity6 's quarter - final win ‘ @entity2 , ’ she tweeted , as did others such as model @entity45 , @entity48 basketball star @entity47 and @entity50 footballers including @entity51 and @entity52 , who must have been secretly delighted to learn @entity6 ’s best player can not face them in tuesday ’s semi-final			1
hundreds of bright yellow replica no 10 shirts on market stalls and hawked by street sellers seemed to sag in disappointment , crested hairstyles drooped around @entity6 and bookmakers , for the first time , decided the hosts could no longer be considered favourites to win			1
@entity2 will not play again in this tournament			1
the initial diagnosis predicted an absence of about six weeks from football and , while parallels can be drawn with @entity71 — the original @entity72 who also hailed from the @entity75 club and was fouled out of a @entity8 , ending @entity77 hopes in 1966 — others tried to lift the gloom			0
leading the campaign was @entity29 , climbing the popularity polls with a statesmanlike air			2
get well soon : @entity83 hugs @entity2 as the @entity6 team wish their star man well after his injury precaution : @entity2 is wheeled into hospital and appears to be on a drip as doctors attend to the injured star not only is he scoring precious goals , like the brilliant free - kick against @entity14 , but the centre - half has a canny knack for connecting with the masses			1
‘ to play in a semi-final of the @entity8 is a dream , ’ said @entity29			1
‘ when i was young , i dreamed of days like this but i am sad because @entity2 is out of the competition			0
' he is like my brother			0
he is a great guy , a great person and a great player who brings the good things to football : happiness and magic			0
‘ @entity6 will suffer a lot from this loss but @entity2 will help us with his happiness			1
we have made a pact to support him			0
he will grow taller from this moment			0
it would be great if we could win it and celebrate with him			0
’ moving : @entity2 was flown to @entity115 by helicopter to begin his recovery devastated : @entity2 is transported from an ambulance to a military helicopter to be airlifted home thanks : @entity2 managed a wave as he left for @entity115 inside the squad , @entity2 is so much more than an icon of youth culture			1
you can see that the warmth and affection colleagues reserve for him is genuine when you watch them training , where he laughs if one of his tricks fails and he is teased like anyone else			0
true , he is their most gifted creative force , capable of lifting @entity6 out of the ordinary , but he also grafts and offers more humility than you might expect for a diamond - studded 22 - year - old whose image appears at every turn and who is adored by millions			1
‘ @entity2 is a boy who fights a lot , ’ said @entity29			1
‘ he dreamed about playing in a @entity8 and now he is out because of a foul the defender probably should have avoided			0
’ @entity14 ’s @entity33 is @entity6 ’s new public enemy , the man who rammed his knee into the base of @entity2 ’s spine as they contested the ball near the end of the quarter - final			1
support : @entity77 model @entity152 said she was praying for a fast recovery for her compatriot team spirit : @entity156 also took to social media to wish his @entity159 teammate a speedy recovery manager @entity161 claimed his star man had been ‘ hunted ’ by opponents after his terrific start to the tournament			1
@entity2 suffered a knee injury against @entity167 when he was cut down in full flight			1
the @entity6 manager , however , swerved the fact that his own side had employed strong - arm tactics on friday in a bid to silence @entity174 , of @entity14			1
@entity29 added : ‘ i never crucify players			2
you do things when you are emotional and do n’t think			0
' i will just say if he did it with bad intentions because he wanted to injure him , then i think he will feel sad			0
if he just tried to stop the game that ’s natural , that ’s football			0
’ @entity6 captain @entity83 offered support for @entity33			1
‘ i know him from @entity188 and he does not have any nastiness in him , ’ said @entity185 defender @entity83 , who was formerly at @entity186			2
‘ what he did was rash but i know it can be difficult to get the ball from @entity2			0
’ the challenge is to prove there is life after @entity2 for a team that have come to rely rather too heavily on his invention and goal threat			2
without him , they will fret about how much they can create from open play			0
national icon : the @entity159 forward is by far the most popular player in @entity161 's squad against @entity167 and @entity14 , the goals came from centre - halves @entity29 , who scored twice , and @entity83 , all from set - pieces			1
who wins most of these free - kicks and corners ? @entity2 , by dribbling at defenders			2
in his absence , there will be a greater onus on others			0
@entity216 is expected to return to a central role , which he will relish , and his @entity219 team - mate @entity218 is among the candidates to come in against @entity221 in @entity222			0
almost as bad for @entity161 is the loss of @entity83			0
the captain is suspended after picking up a yellow card for interfering with a kick by @entity14 goalkeeper @entity227			0
broken : the x-ray showing @entity2 's injured back , highlighting the broken bone @entity83 was magnificent in the quarter - final on friday			1
he is the team ’s strongest and most reliable defender , providing the stability which allows @entity29 to step forward and contribute on the counter-attack			2
the loss will be eased by the return of defensive midfielder @entity236 after a one - match ban but will still be keenly felt			0
‘ this is the moment to show the strength of the squad , ’ said @entity83			2
‘ this moment could mark the start of a revolution for us			0
' we have proposed to win the @entity8 for @entity2			2
it could give us more determination to win			2

@entity2 out of the tournament after injury late in the quarter - final
@entity6 players rally round their star forward
@entity29 *pledges* to ' win and celebrate with him '
captain @entity83 says it could give us more determination to win . ’
