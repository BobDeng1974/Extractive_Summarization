@entity1 ' relegation from the @entity2 ends an unbroken 19 - year stay in the top flight , but comes as little surprise			1
installed as clear favourites to drop into the @entity8 back in february , the @entity1 ' fate was confirmed on sunday when they lost 72 - 12 at @entity9			1
it extended their record losing run to 20 matches and left them 15 points adrift of safety with seven matches left of the regular season			0
dejected : the @entity1 players have been up against it all season and relegation was confirmed on sunday the @entity24 club were one six ever - presents in the top flight since the advent of @entity2 and the switch to summer rugby in 1996			1
they include @entity30 , who could lose their top - flight status next sunday pending the outcome of their @entity35 bid for the re-instatement of the six points they were docked for going into administration earlier this year			2
the @entity1 , formed as @entity40 in 1980 , endured a yo - yo existence up to being given special status when the big switch came 19 years ago and they justified their inclusion by finishing as runners - up to champions @entity30 in 1997			1
they were one of the few @entity48 successes in the ill - fated @entity49 , famously beating @entity51 's @entity50 in front of a packed house at the @entity54 , and reached the @entity56 final in 1999 , when @entity57 led the team out at @entity59 in jeans and open - top shirt			0
back in the day : @entity57 led the @entity1 out for the @entity56 final in 1999 however , when @entity57 eventually withdrew his virgin backing , it signalled a decline which gradually turned into a downward spiral as the club lurched from one crisis to another			2
despite the heavy financial commitment of @entity24 - based businessman @entity72 , the crowds diminished as the club continued its nomadic trail around the capital and , despite brief forays into the play - offs in 2003 and 2005 , they generally hovered near the foot of the table			2
only late surges spared them the wooden spoon in each of the last two seasons , but the writing was on the wall at the end of 2013 when the club found itself on the brink once more following their departure from @entity54			0
head coach @entity90 , who has been connected with the club in various roles since before the advent of @entity2 , reckoned it " died five times " before being thrown a lifeline by @entity98 owner @entity97 , but it was a threadbare team that made the move to @entity100			0
decline : since @entity57 and @entity101 removed their backing the @entity1 have struggled to stay afloat @entity90 was still putting a new - look squad together when the season kicked off and it was no surprise when he made way in may for the promotion of his assistant @entity107			0
the move came too late for @entity107 to prevent the inevitable and for the last two months he has been preparing the way for a new start in the @entity8 , with a raft of new signings and the appointment of an assistant coach			0
it promises to be a difficult route back to the top flight , but @entity107 is up for the fight .			1
