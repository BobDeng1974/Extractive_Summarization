by @entity0 published : 05:10 est , 31 august 2012 updated : 08:32 est , 31 august 2012 an oak tree has gone back to its roots - 200 years after it was taken to the other side of the world			1
as locals emigrated to @entity8 in the 19th century they took with them acorns from an oak tree in @entity11 , @entity12			1
when they settled , the seeds were planted in the families ' own little corner of @entity16			0
and now a sapling grown from an acorn from one of the trees nurtured in @entity8 has been planted back in the village where the 20,000 - mile cross-generational round - trip began			1
what a family tree ! the acorn taken from the tree in @entity8 ( pictured ) has returned home 200 years later as a sapling digging in : @entity27 , 6 , and younger sister @entity28 , 3 , plant the sapling in the same village where it was originally taken from the journey was prompted after someone read a book about people from @entity12 moving to all corners of the earth			1
the tree 's story begins in the 1820s when the @entity41 offered land for settlers to populate @entity8 fearing the @entity44 might try to land there			0
the call was answered by a tiny group of farmers from northern @entity16 including the @entity50 family from @entity51			2
in 1829 the @entity52 and 37 other passengers set sail from @entity55 on the ship @entity57 destined for a new life - accompanying a handful of acorns from a tree growing on the family farm			1
the seeds survived despite being crammed onto a tiny ship for an eight month journey and they even dodged a meteor strike that struck the ship , before eventually being planted by the settlers in their new home			0
now 183 years later saplings from the trees those acorns became at the settler 's new @entity74 home have come all the way back again - and they 've been planted by the grandson and granddaughter of the family who now live in @entity80			2
at @entity11 primary school @entity27 , six , and his young sister three - year - old @entity28 had the honour of planting the extraordinary sapling			0
putting down some roots : the amazing journey has come full - circle thanks to someone in @entity8 seeing a book written by dr @entity89 about people from @entity55 moving all over the world dr @entity89 , whose book prompted the move , with the @entity74 sapling and the oak tree at @entity96 in the paddock @entity27 and @entity28 's grandparents @entity98 and @entity99 live at @entity80 , the place where the original tree still stands where the acorns came from			1
the amazing journey has come full - circle thanks to someone in @entity8 seeing a book written by dr @entity89 called @entity107 - from @entity55 to the @entity108			1
dr @entity89 , from the @entity110 , said he wrote the book to chart the stories of people leaving @entity55 for other parts of the world and one of the stories was about the fabled acorns			1
he said : ' around the 1820s the @entity120 government were worried the @entity44 might settle western @entity8 as we did n't have many people living there			2
' they issued a call in all the national newspapers asking for settlers who would be willing to go there			0
' it was a big risk , they had to take all their farming equipment and livestock and if had to arrive before january 1831 to guarantee them a plot of land			0
' the @entity52 were just one of the family 's who left from @entity12 and @entity137 on an 87 - foot - long ship , @entity57			1
tracing its roots : @entity27 's grandparents , @entity98 and @entity99 , who still live in @entity96 , with what is believed to be the original oak behind them branching out : the tree , which has flourished in @entity8 , was grown when a family packed up and emigrated in the 1800s ' it was an eight month journey to @entity8 with around 37 passengers and 14 crew along there was plenty to contend with on the way , in fact the ship was hit by a meteor en - route killing a sheep and breaking a dog 's leg			2
' when they arrived the settlers made a home for themselves on an area of land called the @entity162 not far from modern - day @entity162			2
' in honour of the journey one family built a house named after the ship , @entity169 , which remains one of the oldest or the oldest building in western @entity8			0
' dr @entity89 , who published his book telling the story of the @entity175 and others in 2011 , said he was amazed when a few months later he was contacted from @entity8			0
he said : ' when i saw the two oak trees at @entity169 i realised they came from the acorns taken over with the settlers , i jokingly said " could you send some acorns over ? " and they did			0
' we planted the seeds in the botanical gardens at the university but then we thought how fitting it would be if they returned to the spot where they came from			0
