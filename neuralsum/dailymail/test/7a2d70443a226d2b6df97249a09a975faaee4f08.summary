it is just 12 weeks since bold claims were emanating from an ultra-confident @entity3 dressing room that this season could yield an unprecedented domestic treble			1
‘ i believe we can win all three trophies , ’ trumpeted goalkeeper @entity6			1
‘ people might laugh at me but maybe in may we will have won the league and cups and i will be laughing			0
’ on wednesday night against @entity3 at @entity12 , however , those carefree early january days seemed so long ago as @entity6 ’s grip of the ball for @entity16 ’s opening goal proved as tight as his grasp on footballing reality			1
@entity3 manager @entity19 is under pressure following his side 's recent slump @entity3 failed to get their hands on the @entity24 as they fell to a 2 - 0 defeat by @entity26 @entity27 outfit @entity3 have failed to win any of their last 10 games as @entity3 slumped to a first derby defeat in 11 years , the loss at @entity12 saw @entity19 ’s team make it 10 matches without a win			1
it ’s not yet may but nobody is laughing at @entity36 as the club gets to grips with an implosion of cataclysmic proportions both on and off the park			0
it does seem a touch bizarre that all is not well at a club that has reached back - to - back domestic cup finals for the first time in 29 years ; qualified for @entity48 competition in three of the last four years ; finished in the @entity27 top six in every one of the last seven years and won the @entity49 in 2010			0
yet as @entity3 have dropped like a stone from early - season table - toppers to potentially even missing out on @entity53 , the fallout has come amid an increasingly acrid war of words surrounding revelations about @entity19 ’s entitlement to a cut from outgoing player sales			1
those close to @entity36 speak of a series of damaging schisms developing on all sides between fans , board and manager ; cumulatively casting increased uncertainty over @entity19 ’s future			1
ahead of the annual general meeting of influential supporters ’ group @entity71 , one leading fan told @entity72 of ‘ overwhelming unhappiness ’ with @entity19 ’s bonus , while his recruitment and tactical nous are also being questioned			1
there is , he added , a growing belief among fans that the manager ’s position is ‘ untenable ’			1
but this has been a slow - burning civil war			0
the seeds of the crisis that appear to have taken place at almost every level of the club were first sown at the end of the winter transfer window when chairman @entity91 took the unpopular decision to sell star players @entity93 and @entity95 to @entity26			0
as furious fans pointed out , had n’t @entity97 used the eve of last may ’s @entity100 defeat by @entity101 to declare @entity36 finances to be their finest since 1986 and vow there would be no player exodus , as occurred after the @entity49 win in 2010 under @entity105 ? @entity3 sold @entity93 ( left ) to @entity26 during the january transfer window @entity95 also sealed a winter move to @entity26 on transfer deadline day the @entity36 supremo even went as far as name - checking @entity93 along with @entity110 and @entity111 as players he would like to keep for ‘ at least another year ’ to help ‘ compete ’ with @entity26			1
@entity110 and @entity111 were quickly sold for £ 3million each last summer , although the fees for both made the sales palatable			0
yet parting with @entity93 and @entity95 just 48 hours after reaching a @entity116 against a @entity26 side @entity91 had vowed to ‘ compete ’ with proved particularly painful for the rank and file			1
‘ i thought it was a strange decision , i must admit , ’ said former @entity3 defender and @entity122 analyst @entity120 recently			1
‘ i can understand letting @entity95 go because he had signed a pre-contract with @entity26 but @entity93 is a different case			0
‘ @entity3 were in touching distance of @entity26 and if you are serious about challenging , then you can sell him in june			1
‘ i read @entity19 saying he wanted to keep both players but that they needed to balance the books			1
but they sold @entity110 and @entity111 for substantial fees in the summer and i read the chairman talking about how great the club ’s finances are			0
‘ it was just a bit odd			0
especially selling to @entity26 , a rival , rather than an @entity139 team			0
’ at first , @entity3 closed ranks to slap down their detractors , reacting with an almost weary derision to anyone questioning the wisdom of selling key players at such a crucial part of the season			1
@entity3 striker @entity148 has scored just two league goals during the course of the current season @entity3 striker @entity152 celebrated a goal by blowing a kiss at opposition goalkeeper @entity155 after starting life post-armstrong and @entity95 with a comprehensive 3 - 0 @entity49 victory at @entity160 , the line spun was that the two players , while talented , did not constitute a two - man team			2
they were at pains to point out that as @entity3 stormed to the top of the @entity27 at the start of the season , @entity93 was often injured while an off - form @entity95 was regularly left on the bench			2
indeed , it was argued that , together , the duo started just three of @entity3 ’s first nine games of the campaign , of which @entity19 ’s side won seven , drew one and lost one			1
after that @entity179 victory , two - goal @entity148 was hailed as the man to step into @entity93 and @entity95 ’s goalscoring boots			0
@entity182 has not hit the net since			0
worryingly , @entity3 then slumped to their first back - to - back defeats of the season and went on to lose the @entity116 to @entity26			2
@entity155 refuses to react as the @entity187 striker does his best to rile his rival goalkeeper at @entity189 @entity187 forward @entity152 celebrates with a kiss but ends up blushing as his side lose derby match @entity194 wheels away in celebration as helps @entity3 earn first derby win in over a decade over the course of four march meetings with @entity200 ’s men , @entity3 were dispatched from the @entity49 and defeated in the league , too , as @entity19 ’s season started to disintegrate			1
as the heat rose on @entity91 , the @entity3 chairman first admitted the sales were a wrong footballing decision but correct from a financial standpoint			2
curiously , though , the spotlight would then eventually turn on @entity19 as @entity71 and the @entity210 of @entity211 ’ @entity208 released a statement saying they were shocked 25 per cent of £ 6.3m worth of transfer fees for @entity110 , @entity111 , @entity93 and @entity95 were paid in commission to unnamed parties			2
@entity3 continue to deny the figures in question but eventually made the bombshell confirmation that @entity19 was indeed entitled to a cut of player transfers			1
even if it was done with the best of intentions — to reduce the manager ’s salary in straitened times while bumping his earnings up if successful in developing young talent to sell — the revelation was toxic in the eyes of many fans			0
their new - found ire towards a manager who led them to two consecutive finals has been further roused by @entity3 losing five - in - a - row for the first time since may 2006			0
amid this poor run , @entity101 defender @entity236 recently claimed that if @entity19 ’s men fall behind , ‘ it gets in their heads ’ and they ‘ argue amongst themselves ’			1
@entity3 goalkeeper @entity6 looks back at his goal after @entity244 opened the scoring @entity16 celebrates his derby goal with a fan as he runs over to the home faithful at @entity189 defeat at @entity36 against hapless @entity249 — without a win in 12 games — is now rendered unthinkable , even if victory would clinch a top - six finish for city rivals @entity3			1
there are those within @entity12 who sense a real opportunity to become the first @entity259 side to finish above @entity3 in the league since 2002 - 03			2
a loss , coupled with a win for on - form @entity3 at @entity101 , would see @entity264 ’s men go above @entity3 in the table on saturday			2
few could have guessed that scenario when , in the first hours of 2015 , @entity3 took @entity3 apart in a record 6 - 2 derby win at @entity36			2
not least @entity269 , who , as a @entity271 player , was impressed by @entity3 in a thrilling 3 - 3 draw at @entity273 in the @entity24 in october before @entity19 ’s side sneaked through on penalties			1
‘ i ’m sure the fans would love us to finish above @entity3 — and it ’s all to play for , ’ said the @entity277 striker , who scored the third in @entity3 ’s 3 - 1 win at @entity279 on wednesday night			1
‘ we ’re only two points behind @entity3 now , so we ’ve just got to keep going when the split comes			2
@entity3 's @entity285 goes down under a challenge from @entity287 during the @entity3 derby @entity3 's @entity269 taps home his side 's third goal of the game as they close in on derby victory ‘ i ’m surprised that they have gone 10 games without a win			1
when i was still at @entity271 earlier this season , we played them in the @entity24 and they were a very good side			0
‘ it ’s a long time not to win but they ’ve still got very good players in the team			0
i ’m sure they will come good again			0
‘ i ’d actually like it if they came good against @entity249 on saturday , though			0
that would be perfect because it would cement our place in the top - six			0
‘ so here ’s hoping they can turn it around on saturday because it would help us			0
it would be ironic , i know , if @entity3 clinched us a top - six place			0
‘ but we go to @entity101 knowing we are definitely in the top six if we win there			0
’ while the tangerine half of @entity3 mourns its fall from grace , the @entity259 are in raptures after breaking a sequence of derbies without victory stretching back to november 2004			2
‘ ending that run against @entity3 was a big motivating factor — and i felt that was the best i ’ve seen us play , ’ said @entity269			1
‘ a lot of the players have n’t been here that long			0
but , for the sake of the fans who have n’t witnessed a win over @entity3 for such a long time , it was really important			1
we did it for them			0
i ’m sure they will enjoy this one for a long time to come			0
’ after a long era in the shadow of their neighbours , @entity3 are daring to dream			2
amid a tangerine nightmare , however , for a @entity3 side in crisis , the @entity332 that once lay ahead has been replaced by trouble .			2

@entity19 's @entity3 have lost their last five games
@entity3 's last defeat came against rivals @entity342 on wednesday
goalkeeper @entity6 tipped his side to win treble in january
fans believe @entity19 's position at the club is ‘ untenable ’
