on the second day of his murder trial at @entity17 , @entity8 insisted that he had never intended to kill his fiancée			2
recalling the start of their vicious row at the @entity35 , off the @entity31 , in may 2009 , @entity8 said it started when he said the medication he was on had dampened his libido			1
miss @entity20 shouted back : ‘ you owe me sex			1
’ not wanting an argument about his sex life in public , @entity8 replied : ‘ my @entity44 , not here ! ’ the couple , who had been due to marry in @entity46 the following august , had agreed a pact in which @entity8 was not allowed to contact former girlfriends			1
but miss @entity20 felt sexually frustrated and withheld eight of the anti-depressant pills @entity8 was used to taking , in a bid to ‘ be intimate with me ’ , said @entity8 , who was left with just two pills			1
‘ she wanted sex and expressed it loudly , and when i asked her to be quiet she got even more angry , so i shouted “ that ’s it ! ” , ’ said @entity8 , who faces up to 30 years in prison if found guilty of murder			1
‘ i was so upset too , as we were having a fantastic trip and it ruined everything in just one minute			0
’ @entity8 ( pictured alongside current fiancee @entity60 ) said ms @entity20 shouted ' you owe me sex ' while they were dining in a restaurant in @entity7 in 2009 , sparking a bitter row the pair made their own way back to the @entity28 , where , after a vodka in the bar , @entity8 opened the door of their room , to be confronted by @entity75 saying : ‘ why did you leave me alone ? how dare you leave me alone in @entity7			1
’ @entity8 , originally from @entity76 , @entity77 , had intended to return to @entity78 straight away , but instead the argument intensified , with furniture being broken and thrown about			2
@entity8 said ‘ everything went black ’ at that point , but ‘ i woke up the next day , and looked at the room – it was terrible ’			2
@entity8 says he argued with ms @entity20 in the bedroom of the five - star @entity28 , @entity7 ( pictured ) , but blacked out			1
when he woke he claims he found blood on the sheets , but had no memory of attacking ms @entity20 ‘ i spent the day cleaning the room			1
i was going to get @entity20 to smuggle in a vacuum cleaner			2
‘ i then called out her name			0
i unmade the bed because i thought she was between the mattresses			0
there was a big stain of blood			0
i did n’t know she was n’t there			0
i thought she was in bed			0
‘ i was really messed up			0
i was in such a state			0
all i was thinking of was getting the room cleaned up			0
the tv was broken , everything was broken			0

‘ she was very cold , ’ added @entity8			2
he said he screamed : ‘ @entity20 , @entity110 , @entity111 , please do n’t go , please do n’t go			2
’ he added : ‘ i did n’t know she was dead			0
when @entity8 found ms @entity20 's body , he said he did n't realise she was dead at first , and put her in a bath to warm up while he placed a ' @entity115 ' sign on the door and cleaned the room ‘ i moved her arm , but somehow thought if i put her in the bath it would warm her up			1
’ asked by judge @entity121 if he had seen the photos of miss @entity20 ’s corpse , which was found floating in the bath and had 92 bruises on it , @entity8 said : ‘ no. i only noticed she had a black eye			1
’ @entity8 claimed he did not think miss @entity20 was dead until about six and a half hours after he woke up on may 24 , the day after their restaurant meal			1
the judge said : ‘ that means you remained five or six hours in the presence of a corpse in a bedroom covered in blood ’ , to which @entity8 replied : ‘ yes			0
’ ms @entity20 was later found floating in the bathtub of the couple 's £ 1,000 - a - night room with almost 100 bruises covering her body ( file picture ) when he finally realised she was dead , a tearful @entity8 said : ‘ i wanted to die			1
i could n’t cope with what had happened			0
’ he thought of jumping out of the window of the fifth - floor room , but then decided he wanted to commit suicide ‘ back home ’ after seeing his parents for the last time			0
the prosecution alleges that @entity8 was ‘ thinking lucidly ’ because he put a ‘ @entity155 ’ sign on the door of the room , and booked an extra two nights , before heading off in his @entity157			0
judge @entity121 said : ‘ you did not want @entity20 ’s body to be discovered before you had put sufficient distance between yourself and the @entity162			2
