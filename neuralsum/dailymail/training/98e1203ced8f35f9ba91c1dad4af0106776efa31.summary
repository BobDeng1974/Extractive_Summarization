the statement he made summed up the rivalry			2
in september 2002 , sir @entity3 was asked about the great challenge @entity5 were facing at that particular time			1
' my greatest challenge was knocking @entity9 right off their * * * * * * * perch , ' he responded			1
' and you can print that			0
' he eventually realised his ambition , in may 2011 , when @entity5 secured their 19th league title			1
it might have been symbolic for the general public but , speaking from a @entity9 perspective , there was no dwelling on what they achieved			1
our focus was on how we could turn the situation around			0
@entity26 gives instructions to his @entity9 players during training at @entity30 on friday @entity9 's players seem in high spirits in training despite their difficult start to this season @entity34 goes for a header ( left ) , while @entity36 shows he 's a safe pair of hands but on the eve of @entity9 's latest trip to @entity42 , i think about @entity3 's words and find myself asking questions : are @entity9 ever going to knock @entity5 off their perch ? or has a glorious opportunity been squandered ? when @entity3 retired , a door opened for @entity9			1
he was an empire on his own , one of the biggest influences on football this country has seen but , suddenly , his departure transformed things			0
there was a glimmer of light to exploit			2
look at what happened : @entity9 beat @entity5 twice , the second time being with the most emphatic performance i can remember a @entity9 team producing at @entity42			1
they were even awarded three penalties that day – would that have happened with @entity3 in the dugout ? so it was crucial @entity9 made the right steps following that thumping 3 - 0 victory in march ; first by winning the league and then , crucially , with successful player recruitment			1
doing that would have made things difficult for @entity5 – who had not ended up below @entity9 in the table for 12 years – to get back into the @entity76 at the first chance			1
@entity34 onhis haunches after @entity9 were knocked out of the @entity76 on tuesday night @entity5 are on the up and @entity80 ( left ) celebrates his winner at @entity82 on monday yet here we are on december 13 , exactly seven months after the last campaign ended , and @entity5 are back on the front foot , third in the table			1
they are an average side , compared to @entity3 's teams of the past , but being in transition has not hindered their ambitions			1
in adding @entity91 and @entity92 , @entity5 bought the better players			1
@entity9 may have spent more than £ 100million but where has it left them ? and when will they be able to lavish such a figure again ? looking at them now , you feel they need another £ 100m spending just to improve			1
once you begin to examine the respective finances of both clubs , you see the extent of the power behind @entity5			1
their recently published accounts showed they brought in revenue of £ 433.2m in 2013 - 14			0
@entity9 's , by comparison , was £ 206.1m			1
@entity42 , with 30,000 more seats , is a money - making machine			0
yes , @entity9 are getting a fantastic new @entity108 , which will be ready in august 2016 , but it will take time for benefits to be felt			1
while @entity113 is being revamped , @entity5 's £ 750m kit deal with adidas will kick in			1
@entity80 ( left ) and @entity114 will be the main threats for @entity5 at @entity42 on sunday @entity5 , including former @entity117 keeper @entity116 ( left ) are put through their paces at @entity119 @entity120 ( left ) oversees proceedings in preparation for the biggest match in @entity125 football when you consider all that , it proves @entity5 could – if they desire – spend £ 100m every summer			1
@entity9 have never had that luxury and it feels like , once again , they have handed their most bitter rivals a ' get out of jail free ' card			2
the @entity134 table , showing @entity5 in third and @entity9 ninth it keeps happening			1
when we finished second to @entity139 in 2002 , the next step was to win the league			0
we were outstanding in the cups , as our treble in 2001 showed , and we had beaten @entity5 in five consecutive games over two campaigns			2
the right moves would have given us a great chance			2
instead , we bought @entity149 , @entity150 and @entity151 for £ 20m , all of whom failed			0
that same summer , @entity5 paid £ 29.3m to smash the @entity153 transfer record for @entity154 , @entity3 fixed his defence and , 12 months later , they were champions			1
@entity5 have an ability to land ' star ' names with @entity159 offering the latest proof			1
in my time at @entity9 , it was all about developing players to become stars yet surely last summer was the moment for them to show they could compete at the highest transfer level ? @entity167 used to say @entity9 had ' to be perfect ' when buying players to compete with @entity5 but he made mistakes , just like @entity170 did before and all the others who succeeded him			1
when that keeps happening , is it any surprise a gulf exists between the clubs ? history shows the dominance in this rivalry goes in cycles			1
@entity5 , with the @entity181 and three league titles , were the teams of the 1950s			2
they added a @entity76 in 1968 but @entity9 , during the @entity183 , were a becoming an irresistible force under @entity185			2
the moment @entity5 knocked @entity9 off their perch - sir @entity3 with the @entity134 trophy in 2011 , which was his club 's 19th title , taking them ahead of their great rivals sports analysts @entity192 believe a @entity5 win is the most likely outcome against @entity9 that led to @entity9 's total superiority in the 1970s and 1980s before it swung again , with @entity5 and @entity3 dominating the @entity134 era			1
this conflict has always ebbed and flowed and achievements are evenly matched ; @entity9 have 59 major trophies			1
without @entity3 , though , they looked vulnerable			2
they experienced great change at a number of levels , first with @entity205 and then @entity120 , and had @entity9 played their cards right , they could have finally reasserted themselves and left @entity5 scrambling catch up			1
now you can not escape the conclusion @entity9 are doing the scrambling			2
going out of the @entity76 on tuesday night was a savage blow and my initial fear was that after waiting five years to return to that competition , it could be another few years before they get back in again			0
@entity5 , on the other hand , look like they are resuming normal service			2
they need working on before they reach a title - winning level once more but they remain on their perch they claimed in may 2011			1
@entity9 have let them off the hook			2
win a trophy and @entity221 ’s turnaround is complete the transformation in @entity221 ’s fortunes at @entity224 is one of the stories of the season and he deserved to enjoy the @entity229 win			0
it shows what can happen when clubs persevere with managers , and victory at @entity139 tonight would propel them into the top five			0
given the confidence he and his players have , @entity224 will believe they can get a result at the @entity240			2
@entity221 poses with his @entity241 for november realistically , though , how long will @entity224 stay there ? sooner or later , the clubs with better resources will elbow them away from the @entity76 spots			0
if @entity224 finish seventh or eighth , it represents a good season			0
@entity221 , however , has a chance to make it a memorable one			0
they have a quarter - final in the @entity251 at @entity252 on wednesday and they will not want to squander that opportunity			0
@entity224 ’s fans are desperate for silverware and , if @entity221 can deliver , people would really sit up and take notice of the job he has done			0
@entity221 celebrates with assistant @entity260 after @entity224 beat @entity229 last weekend @entity261 is all about winning trophies			2
everyone praised @entity224 for finishing fifth in 2012 but supporters will never say : ‘ remember that year we qualified for the @entity265 ? ’ they want to talk about famous days at @entity267 and , for @entity224 , it has been too long coming			0
like @entity221 , @entity268 at @entity269 has worked hard to turn things round			0
but if they want to change perceptions , a trophy would do that			0
this week i ’m looking forward to : seeing @entity277 ... go back to war i know from experience that when @entity277 is in the mood and he gets the right kind of service , he is unplayable			0
he is a nightmare for defenders to handle			0
@entity286 and @entity287 , then , will be bracing themselves for what is headed in their direction this afternoon at the @entity292			0
@entity277 was outstanding in @entity269 ’s win over @entity294 last week and he will want to build on it			0
@entity269 's @entity277 celebrates after scoring against @entity294 last week the corresponding game last season between @entity298 and @entity269 was shown on @entity261 and @entity277 absolutely tormented @entity287 and @entity286			0
@entity277 knocked @entity287 over when scoring and @entity286 ended up being substituted			0
@entity298 ’s defenders had a straightforward afternoon at @entity113 seven days ago when keeping a clean sheet but if @entity277 is in the frame of mind he showed against @entity294 , it will be anything but for @entity304 ’s men			0
it will make for interesting viewing .			0

sir @entity3 and @entity5 knocked @entity9 off their perch in 2011 when they won their 19th title
when @entity3 retired there was a glimmer of hope for @entity9
however , @entity5 are currently third and @entity9 ninth
the dominance in this great rivalry goes in cycles
@entity5 buy star names , @entity9 buy players to develop into stars
@entity9 have won 59 major trophies , @entity5 have 58
