you 'd forgive @entity1 for feeling a sense of de ja vu on saturday			0
not only was he playing against @entity3 for the first time since leaving on transfer deadline day but , once more , we caught a glimpse of @entity1 the winger			0
the @entity9 international has spent his @entity12 career as the main man ; the central striker - playing in the position he so craved during his time at @entity17			1
occupying the left - flank at @entity3 was often a frustration for @entity1 , but with @entity38 and @entity39 ahead of him in the pecking order it was the only way he could get a game under sir @entity42 and @entity43			0
@entity1 had been warned a move wide was coming , @entity18 all but confirmed he would on friday now @entity45 - who started the match on the bench - is fit again			2
it was n't long , though , before we saw @entity1 moved back into his preferred role in the centre			0
likewise , it was n't long before he was shifted back out wide - and then back to a central striker position for the end of first half			2
maybe , it was @entity18 's way of easing him into a longer stint on the left flank once @entity45 is fully match fit			0
and , almost inevitably , @entity18 sent @entity1 back out wide - to the right this time - once @entity45 was introduce in the 77th minute			1
you wonder what @entity1 was thinking when @entity45 scored ? perhaps he should get used to be being a wide - boy			1
@entity1 checks on @entity12 and @entity9 team - mate @entity64 after the midfielder goes down injured @entity33 and @entity66 react to @entity68 ' own goal while @entity1 stands over the ball @entity70 stops @entity1 by putting in a superb last - ditch tackle on his former team - mate @entity1 stands with former team - mates @entity74 , @entity70 , @entity75 and @entity22 @entity3 goalkeeper @entity76 saves a shot by @entity1 during his side 's 2 - 1 win @entity45 came on to score @entity12 's only goal of the game against @entity3			1

@entity12 striker @entity1 spent the majority of game on wing
@entity33 and @entity45 were handed *chance* to impress as main central striker
@entity45 scored @entity12 's only goal of the game in 95th minute
