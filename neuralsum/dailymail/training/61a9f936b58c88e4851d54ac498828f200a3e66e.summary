by @entity0 keeping track of polar bear populations in icy and treacherous conditions could be easier from space , according to research			1
scientists have used satellite pictures to monitor the creatures off the coast of @entity10 , and claim the technology could be used to keep tabs on how the rapidly melting @entity14 ice is affecting their numbers			1
the images are said to be so detailed , each shot uses around @entity18 of computer space - 1,300 times more than the average @entity21 photo			0
keeping track of polar bear populations ( stock image pictured ) in icy and treacherous conditions could be easier from space , according to research			2
scientists have used satellite pictures to monitor the creatures off the coast of @entity10 high - tech satellites orbiting 480 miles above @entity32 are being used for an unusual task - to keep tabs on the movement of whales			1
conservationists from the @entity38 ( @entity38 ) have developed a way of using the space technology to count how many of the mammals are currently living in our seas			0
the satellites , including the @entity45 , take photos of the sea , which are then studied using state - of - the - art software to identify whales below the surface			0
the researchers began by looking at images taken during late summer in 2012 , and counted the number of bears on the island			2
the creatures could be distinguished from other light - coloured spots by comparing the satellite pictures with different images of the same island			1
an earlier survey suggested there were around 100 bears , and the satellite estimate confirmed this			2
wildlife experts now believe that using satellite pictures could be useful in keeping track of the @entity14 polar bear populations , as the speed at which @entity14 ice is melting has increased			1
development of efficient techniques for monitoring wildlife is a priority in the @entity14 , where the impacts of climate change are acute and remoteness and logistical constraints hinder access			0
during analysis , clouds were found to be one of the factors that could make detecting the bears more difficult			0
the locations of the polar bears are circled on each image an earlier survey suggested there were around 100 bears off the coast of @entity93 , @entity10 ( pictured ) , and the satellite estimate confirmed this			1
wildlife experts now claim using satellites could be useful in keeping track of the @entity14 polar bear populations , as the speed at which @entity14 ice is melting has increased dr @entity100 , from the @entity101 in @entity102 said : ‘ the loss of @entity14 sea ice has accelerated during recent years , with minimum sea ice extent reaching a record low during september , 2012			1
‘ a nearly ice - free summer is now forecasted to occur as early as 2016			0
' such large - scale , precipitous environmental changes will be detrimental for many species dependent on sea ice habitats			0
‘ despite potentially massive ecological impacts , regimes for monitoring wildlife remain deficient across large portions of the @entity14			0
this image reveals where the polar bears were spotted during the aerial survey ( in blue )			2
the yellow dots are the polar bears discovered using @entity122 's satellite images these images were taken during late summer in 2012			1
polar bears are present in the circles in the target image ( top ) but absent in the reference image ( bottom )			0
features that remain consistent between images , including rocks and substrate , are shown with red arrows ‘ we evaluated high resolution satellite imagery as a tool to track the distribution and abundance of polar bears			1
‘ our findings suggest that satellite imagery is a promising tool for monitoring polar bears on land , with implications for use with other @entity14 wildlife			2
’ the findings were published in the journal @entity152 .			0

researchers tracked polar bears in @entity10 using high resolution satellites
they studied images from the summer and counted the number of bears
an earlier aerial study estimated there were around 100 bears on the island
the analysis of the satellite images revealed a *similar* amount - *90* bears
creatures could be distinguished from other light coloured spots by comparing the satellite pictures with different images of the same island
experts claim satellites could be used to track @entity14 polar bear numbers
