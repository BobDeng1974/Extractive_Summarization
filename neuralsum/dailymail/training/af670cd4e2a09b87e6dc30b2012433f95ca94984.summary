missing @entity2 did not crash and its current whereabouts may be know to the @entity4 and the @entity6 aircraft company , @entity1 's influential former prime minister @entity0 has claimed			1
dr @entity0 said the plane could have been switched onto autopilot remotely by the @entity4 if it had been hijacked			1
' remotely by radio or satellite links by government agencies like the @entity4 , if terrorists attempt to gain control of the flight deck , ' he wrote in an entry entitled ' what goes up must come down ' on his blog , chedet			2
' certainly not these days with all the powerful communication systems , radio and satellite tracking and filmless cameras which operate almost indefinitely and possess huge storage capacities			0
' ' the plane is somewhere , maybe without @entity26 [ @entity26 ] markings , ' he said , reports the @entity46			1
' it is a waste of time and money to look for debris or oil slick or to listen for pings from the black box			1
â€œ for some reason , the media will not print anything that involves @entity6 or the @entity4 , ' he said			2
dr @entity0 , 88 , who was @entity1 's prime minister between 1981 and 2003 , said the missing flight 's communication system ' must have been disabled '			1
waste of time and money : the former @entity1 @entity63 dr @entity0 says the air - sea sorties over the @entity65 by aircraft such as the @entity69 @entity68 @entity67 ( above ) to try and locate the remains of @entity2 are futile ' or else the flight of @entity2 would have been tracked by satellites which normally provide data on all commercial flights , inclusive of data on location , kind of aircraft , flight number , departure airport and destination			1
' but the data seems unavailable			0
the plane just disappeared seemingly from all screens			0
' @entity2 is a @entity6 aircraft			2
it was built and equipped by @entity6			0
' all the communications and gps equipment must have been installed by @entity6			0
if they failed or have been disabled @entity6 must know how it can be done			1
' surely @entity6 would ensure that they can not be easily disabled as they are vital to the safety and operation of the plane			2
' dr @entity0 's blog posts come after the current @entity1 prime minister @entity93 described the location by satellite of purported @entity2 debris in the @entity65 as ' bizarre ' and ' hard to believe '			1
mr @entity93 told @entity97 he did not believe it when he first heard about the critical satellite data on which the current search in the @entity65 is based on			0
' to be honest , i found it hard to believe , ' said the prime minister			0
' it 's a bizarre scenario which none of us could have contemplated so that 's why when i met the team ... of foremost experts in aviation industry i asked them again and again " are you sure ? " '' and their answer to me was we are as sure as we can possibly be			0
' @entity1 , @entity28 and @entity113 authorities met last weekend to discuss the latest stages of the @entity2 by ships staged in the @entity116			2
@entity113 navy survey ship @entity118 will start mapping the seabed off the west @entity28 coast this week as part of the latest phase in the search , @entity28 's @entity117 said .			0

@entity4 and @entity6 may be hiding information about missing @entity2
former @entity1 @entity63 dr @entity0 says airplanes like @entity2 ' do *n't* just disappear '
if the plane failed or have been disabled then ' @entity6 must know '
@entity0 said the plane may have had its @entity26 airline markings removed
the air - sea search out of @entity29 for debris is a ' waste of time and money '
