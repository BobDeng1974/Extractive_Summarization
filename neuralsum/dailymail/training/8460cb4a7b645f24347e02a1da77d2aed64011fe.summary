@entity0 was watching his soldiers carrying out their latest invasion exercises in pictures released today , showing how the @entity4 remains perpetually on the brink of war			1
@entity8 's portly dictator stood with his military officials as soldiers leapt from hovercraft onto soggy , mist - shrouded beaches in an undisclosed location			2
the 31 - year - old , who followed his father and grandfather as @entity8 's supreme leader , appeared to have stern words for his military men , who listened intently and took notes as he told them his views			2
his older , uniformed advisors peered intently as @entity0 outlined his strategy , keeping note of his instructions in small @entity50 size notebooks			0
although the photographs , all taken and distributed by the state - run @entity53 ( @entity53 ) are undated , they presumably show drills taking place in recent days			2
they come despite @entity58 strongly warning @entity8 against staging any military provocations ahead of today 's fourth anniversary of a northern artillery attack which killed two @entity58 marines and two civilians			1
what 's happening ? @entity0 peers out at the invasion drill with his binoculars much better ! @entity8 's supreme leader appears to be much happier with the operation now @entity70 spokesman @entity69 was quoted by @entity71 as saying : ' we strongly warn @entity8 to remember its provocations will lead to self - destruction			0
' he also demanded that @entity8 's stop blaming his country for the bombardment of @entity79 in 2010 , which also injured 19 people in one of the most serious incidents since the end of the korean war			0
' @entity8 should stop the shameful conduct of covering the sun with hands and make an apology and punish those found responsible ( for the attack ) , ' he said			0
looking to the horizon : @entity0 looks on even after his hovercrafts have made their way up the beach officer class : the @entity8 dictator holds the rank of @entity38 in the @entity98 @entity58 had earlier staged a live - firing exercise near @entity79 on the @entity101 sea border of @entity102 , which northern diplomats had condemned			1
a @entity98 statement broadcast through @entity53 accused @entity58 of ' driving the situation to an extreme phase through provocations in the acute hotspot waters , still without discretion			1
' ' the south korean military warmongers should never forget the lesson from the bitter defeat in the @entity114 shelling all the time , ' the statement , translated by @entity71 , said .			0

today is the fourth anniversary of *deadly* artillery strike on @entity58
