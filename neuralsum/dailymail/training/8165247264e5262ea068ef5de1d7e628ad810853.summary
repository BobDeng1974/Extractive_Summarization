@entity6 trader @entity0 , 39 , said he had effectively ‘ signed my own death warrant ’ by making a complaint about his pay			1
his annual earnings had dropped from £ 533,000 to £ 518,000 , with the bank blaming the cut on the global financial crisis			1
mr @entity0 objected and four months later he was made redundant , leaving him to survive on unemployment benefit , @entity15 was told			1
now he is claiming £ 1million in unfair dismissal and breach of contract			0
he is also claiming to be a ‘ whistleblower ’ about the culture at the @entity23 banking giant , where making complaints is ‘ seen as detrimental to your career ’			0
mr @entity0 , of @entity27 , @entity28 , accuses the bank of reneging on a deal to improve his pay after he turned down a job offer from a rival			1
he said he had been headhunted by @entity34 in 2010 and offered a deal worth $ 1.1million ( £ 670,000 ) a year			2
but he agreed to stay at @entity6 after his bosses promised to match the offer , he claimed			2
however , not only did his bosses fail to make good on the deal , they cut his wages too , he claimed			0
he was made redundant in january 2012 after 14 years at the bank , having worked his way up from analyst to senior trader in the company ’s derivatives division			0
he said the culture at @entity6 was such that it only allowed people to speak out if they agreed with senior bosses			2
mr @entity0 told the panel yesterday : ‘ despite my good performance , i was a squeaky wheel who was not prepared to put up and shut up			1
mr @entity0 , 39 , had worked at @entity6 for 14 years when he was made redundant in january 2012 ‘ this effectively was me signing my own death warrant at @entity6			1
that was the deal , $ 1.1million , they offered when i turned down @entity34 , and i would not just keep quiet about it			2
i was made assurances by my senior manager at @entity6 , @entity60 , that they would match this offer			0
‘ i asked for a written contract from mr @entity60 that he would match the $ 1.1million offered by @entity34 , but he told me due to the @entity64 50 per cent bonus tax at the time , he would not provide one			2
‘ when i was paid $ 850,000 ( £ 518,000 ) the following year – not the deal agreed – i was told there was not enough money to pay what was agreed			1
’ but @entity34 never put its offer in writing either , and was not ‘ hammering on his door ’ to hire him , the tribunal heard			2
@entity74 , representing @entity6 , said mr @entity0 had never received a written contract agreeing the new job or terms of the offer			1
during a heated exchange , mr @entity79 claimed : ‘ the truth is you did n’t have an offer to match			0
it is quite common for bankers at bonus time to say “ it is n’t enough ”			0
i do n’t think i ’ve ever met a banker who thinks he is overpaid			0
’ the trader replied : ‘ i have written my witness statement and sworn an oath and you keep asserting i am lying			0
mr @entity0 told the tribunal he signed his own ' death warrant ' with the company by complaining about pay ‘ i do n’t think anyone can sit and say being paid $ 800,000 is being underpaid , but it just was not what was agreed			1
’ on the culture at the banking giant , mr @entity0 claimed : ‘ the practice at @entity6 is to attempt to pay you a minimum it thinks it needs to in order to keep you happy and not look to move to a competitor			1
' speaking up at @entity6 is welcomed so long as you are agreeing with senior management , and making complaints is seen as detrimental to your career , as it is wholly at their discretion how much compensation you will be getting and promotion is impossible without backing			0
‘ i am aware that going up against @entity6 will harm my chances of finding employment elsewhere in the industry in the future			0
sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
