the @entity1 page for a high - end nanny agency in @entity3 has turned into a real life version of the hit 2002 novel @entity7 , revealing some of the most over-the - top requests made by rich families seeking household help			1
the staff behind @entity12 and @entity13 post a variety of advertisements for a wide range of positions on the company 's @entity1 page , each of which include a detailed description of what the family require from any future employee			1
from speaking fluent @entity26 to being a professionally - qualified chef , there seems to be no end to the lofty expectations held by some of @entity3 's most eligible families when it comes to finding the perfect person to care for their children			0
' [ there are some ] i would definitely call strange , ' agency owner @entity36 told @entity39 of the weird and wonderful requests her company receives			0
' and we also have parents requesting nannies to hold a master 's degree and work six days			0
' much like those stories detailed in the @entity63 best - selling novel @entity7 , which was written by former nannies @entity64 and @entity66 before being turned into a movie starring @entity68 , the requests details on the company 's @entity1 page range from the most simple - to the most complex			1
for example , one @entity74 family stated that any eager applicants for the position available in their household must be fluent in both @entity79 and @entity80 , a @entity26 dialect most commonly used in @entity82			0
' you must be legal to work and you must have references working as a nanny , and you must speak @entity79 and @entity80 fluently , ' the family 's ad explains , while another states : ' please be able to clean a large formal home ... ' the family has parties at their weekend home , so it is helpful if you know how to set a formal table and if you can cook healthy meals			2
' one family asks that their nanny be able to take their children out for play dates - and @entity103 auditions - offering a salary of $ 16 per hour to the successful applicant			1
indeed , while some families are prepared to make extravagant demands of their future nanny or housekeeper , their salary offers do n't always match up to their over-the - top requirements			1
great expectations : many wealthy @entity3 - based families , like the family featured in hit 2007 movie @entity7 ( pictured ) , require their nannies to speak at least two languages fluently according to @entity39 , one @entity120 - based mother asked that @entity12 find her a nanny who could work a 50 - hour week , which included home - schooling her six children , all for just $ 450 per week , or just $ 9 per hour			1
the average salary offered to nannies sourced by @entity12 is $ 800 per week for just two children - and that usually does n't involve home - schooling of any kind			2
but for those nannies who are able to meet the strict requirements of many of the families - there are usually some incredibly impressive rewards on offer			0
many of the parents require that their household staff accompany them on all - expenses - paid holidays , with one family asking that their nanny be willing to travel with them on annual trips to @entity144 and @entity145			1
another ad , which is calling for a ' very in shape , athletic and energetic ' college graduate , includes the promise of regular stays at the family 's summer home in @entity154 , as well as month - long getaways in @entity156 and @entity157			0
' we do have wonderful clients who offer five weeks of paid vacation and $ 65,000 per year for 45 hours with health insurance , ' ms @entity158 added to @entity56			2
' we also have clients who allow nannies to order whatever food they want for lunch every day , buy their nannies @entity168 snow pants when they go skiing and we even had a client pay for a nanny 's plane ticket to @entity173 when her mother was in the hospital			0
' additionally , we have clients who give $ 5,000 to $ 10,000 @entity177 bonuses on occasion , but a bonus like that is rare			0
