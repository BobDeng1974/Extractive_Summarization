the @entity1 resort in @entity2 is huge			1
even the name is on the big side and when i looked at its website i had misgivings , not least because i have stayed in so many unwieldy hotels around the world that i always long for something small and personal			1
i had visions of elbowing fellow holidaymakers at the breakfast buffet and setting the alarm to grab a sun lounger that might actually face the sun. mum 's the word : @entity19 and her son @entity20 enjoyed their first trip to @entity2 what 's more , this was to be an important holiday for my three - year - old son , @entity20 , and neither of us had been to this @entity30 island before			1
but , from the moment we set foot in the 28 - hectare resort near @entity35 , i realised my worries were entirely misplaced			1
frankly , we were bowled over			2
yes , it is big - in fact it is really two hotels joined together - but it never felt big and there were days when we hardly saw a soul			1
it helps , of course , that there are five or six different beaches to choose from , four swimming pools ( three with salt water ) , five restaurants , five bars , a mini football pitch and golf course			2
our room faced the sea			0
on clear days we could see @entity55 looming over the @entity56 and every evening we were treated to spectacular sunsets			0
whoever designed this place should take a bow			0
there were children 's areas , adults - only areas , family areas and ones where no one seemed to go at all			1
everywhere there was an abundance of trees , shrubs and pots spilling over with all the colours of the @entity75			0
you could potter about for hours along shaded walkways as if wandering around your own private garden			0
the word that kept coming into my mind was ' tranquil ' , which , given there are more than 250 rooms , is amazing			0
even the staff seemed completely relaxed , but they were also highly efficient and went out of their way to make everyone feel special			0
on a couple of occasions i arranged for a babysitter for @entity20 and , believe me , i am not a mother who readily leaves her child with a total stranger			1
but i trusted them completely and @entity20 seemed to look forward to their arrival			1
there were very few @entity100 people staying - and lots of @entity30			1
i took that as a good sign because @entity30 love children			1
they also love food and wine and are at their best in the sunshine			0
come to think of it , food , wine and sunshine rate high on my own list of priorities — especially food , after @entity117 , where to my astonishment i reached the final			1
the big morning decision was whether to make camp by the pool or on one of the beaches			0
bolts from the blue : the hotel sits on the serene waters of the @entity56 i liked having that choice and what i liked especially was that the beaches were quiet and not overrun with jet skiers			0
one day , i dropped @entity20 off at the kids ' club and booked in for a day of windsurfing and kitesurfing			1
i learned to windsurf in @entity138 , where my mother and brother still live and where i try to visit as often as i can			0
but i had never attempted kite - surfing			1
kite - surfing is great fun once you get the hang of it - and you need a good teacher			1
it 's also fantastic exercise , because it depends a lot on core muscles and , as we are relentlessly told by fitness gurus , it 's those core muscles that form the basis of a well - toned body			2
with kitesurfing , you first have to learn how to fly a kite , which means getting to grips with the direction of the wind			0
in fact , there 's a lot of preparation work to do before going on the water and having a board strapped to your feet			0
i seemed to get the hang of it			0
perhaps our best day was when we went out on @entity172 , one of the resort 's fishing boats			2
we went exploring around the north point and then visited the island of @entity178			1
it was magical - and the ice creams were the best ever			2
we called in at the church of @entity178 and then i swam back to the boat and was met with drinks and canapes			0
@entity185 has a @entity187 spa , where i spent as much time as i could			2
it has lots of jets that pummel your body into submission but afterwards you feel amazingly invigorated and ready to conquer the world			0
actually , i think @entity20 and i both felt ready to conquer something or other after our a week at @entity185			1
more importantly , our holiday worked brilliantly for both of us			2
i know we will be back and just hope it 's soon			0
double rooms at @entity203 ( 0039 0789 790316 , www.delphinahotels.co.uk ) start at £ 103 per person per night , half - board			2
@entity206 ( easyjet.com ) flies from @entity207 to @entity208 from £ 58 return			0
