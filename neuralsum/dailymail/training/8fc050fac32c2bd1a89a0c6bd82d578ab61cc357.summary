by @entity1 reporter published : 00:48 est , 11 september 2012 updated : 07:48 est , 11 september 2012 in hiding : @entity2 , pictured here just days before @entity3 was released in february 1989 , was forced to live in protective custody for fear that extremists would assassinate him @entity2 has revealed the scariest hour of his life when he thought that his ex-wife and young son had been killed because of his work			1
in preparation for the release of his new book detailing his months spent in hiding in 1989 , @entity12 novelist @entity2 wrote an article for @entity17 telling how he feared that he would have to sacrifice himself in order to save his son			1
the journey begins after the release of his book @entity3 in february 1989 , when @entity2 went into protective custody after @entity25 ayatollah @entity24 went on the national radio and issued a fatwa , or religious order for @entity29 , condoning his assassination and offering a bounty for his head			1
though the threat started in @entity25 - far from @entity36 's home in @entity37 - it carried great weight as the author 's book was considered blasphemous by many @entity29 throughout the globe			1
the threat was thought to be so credible that the @entity12 police deemed it level 2 , meaning he came after the @entity46 in the pecking order of possible targets			1
shortly after being assigned a constant security detail - which included volunteer officers because the risk attached to the duty of guarding him was so great that the police could not order officers to take on the assignment - @entity2 and his then - wife fled @entity37 in hopes of steering clear of angry mobs			2
before doing so , he visited his first wife @entity59 and their young son @entity60			2
they made a plan that they would check in every night at 7pm on the dot to make sure that both parties were alright			2
angry protests : on february 14 , 1989 , the @entity25 ayatollah @entity24 said on the national radio that a religious law - a fatwa - now existed against @entity2 because his book slandered the prophet @entity72 the plan was to have @entity75 's home phone , and if they knew they were not going to be there at the time , they would leave a message on @entity2 's machine in @entity37			1
it worked perfectly for months and gave @entity2 the assurance that he needed while hiding out in the countryside			1
fear : the @entity12 police deemed the degree of threats against @entity2 as @entity90 , second only to the @entity46 a month into his life of hiding , @entity2 called as per usual but had no response from @entity59 and had no message on his machine			1
an hour went by , and @entity2 was in true panic mode			2
he had his security detail arrange for a @entity37 squadron go check on the house to see if it looked like there had been an attack			0
his fears were realized when the police reported that all of the lights were on in the home and the front door was open			0
@entity2 sat with his face dripping wet with tears as he ran through options where an angry mob had killed his ex-wife during a struggle but held on to his young son in an effort to negotiate a ransom for @entity2 's head			0
' you understand , that if they have him and they want a ransom , they want me to exchange myself for him , then i ’m going to do that , and you guys ca n’t stop me doing it , ' @entity2 told his body man , @entity129			0
' that thing about exchanging hostages , that only happens in the movies			0
in real life , i ’m sorry to tell you , if this is a hostile intervention they are both probably dead already			0
the question you have to ask yourself is , do you want to die as well ? ' @entity129 replied			0
the minutes of tense waiting were punctuated only by the sound of @entity2 dialling and redialling the home number of his ex-wife			0
then and now : though the fatwa has never been officially retracted , @entity2 no longer lives in hiding finally , he heard his young son 's voice pick up and explain that they had been at a school drama event that ran overtime			1
all was fine but @entity2 's calm had not returned as he feared that intruders were hiding inside the house since police had seen that the door was ajar before @entity59 and @entity60 got home			2
' it would seem , that there has been a regrettable error			0
the car we sent to have a look looked at the wrong house , ' @entity129 said			0
the phone schedule and the many other ways in which his life changed following the fatwa are the basis for the author 's latest book , entitled @entity168 as an homage to his alternate identity used while he was under protection , which is released next week .			1
