by @entity0 in a @entity3 special , @entity2 's golf correspondent @entity1 picks out what he is looking forward to most when the best players on the planet descend on @entity7 this week for the @entity8			1
1 ) the return of @entity10			1
ok , it ’s certainly not the @entity10 of 2006 vintage and he might only be around for two days			1
but we ’ve seen enough in practice to suggest he might just surprise one or two people			2
it will certainly add to the event watching him try			0
he 's back : legendary three - time open champion @entity10 has returned from injury @entity24 attraction : crowds gather to watch @entity10 tee off at the 5th on a practice round video do n't give up on @entity28 2 ) atmosphere			1
at @entity30 last year the golf was good , the weather even better but the event was as flat as a pancake			1
with an extra 80,000 spectators expected through the gates and boosting the overall attendance to around 200,000 , things should be a lot different this week			0
yes , it ’s all very fascinating watching @entity40 shoot 63 or 64 in first rounds of tournaments and then allow an imposter to take his place the following day			1
but this is the @entity46			1
so can the real @entity40 please show up for all four days here and not just three ? 4 ) a @entity48 has been watching a video of his fabled final round last year which is just as well given his results sheet over the past 12 months			1
let ’s hope the good memories rub off on the popular @entity54			0
there ’s not a lot to beat watching @entity57 when he thrills			0
making a point : experienced @entity54 @entity59 won his first @entity46 at @entity30 last year @entity61 ' new feeling ' for defending champion @entity59 consistency issues : @entity40 needs to turn up on all four days at @entity7 if he is to win 5 ) the @entity64			1
good to see that the @entity65 have given @entity7 factory worker @entity66 a nice draw alongside @entity54 @entity68 and scot @entity69			1
no unearthly starting time either			2
the local man tees off in the first round at 10.32am			0
it ’s only right they ’ve kept the iconic yellow scoreboard at the 18th but it ’s also good they ’ve been replaced elsewhere with all - singing , all - dancing scoreboards telling people an awful lot more than simply a player ’s hole - by - hole scores			2
7 ) watching tv while walking around the course			0
how brilliant to be able to follow your favourite player while still catching up with all the action on the @entity87			0
that ’s the smartphone promise anyway if you download the @entity46 app , thanks to the internet ‘ mesh ’ installed			2
local lad : @entity66 has been handed a favourable draw by the @entity98 8 ) a @entity99			0
all corners of the @entity101 have men who are fully capable of contending			0
true , the @entity46 does n’t depend on one or two of them making a genuine tilt at winning the @entity106 , but it tends to be a better championship when they do			2
9 ) spending an hour beside the @entity109			0
with the sun out , there ’s no better place to watch than clambering up the bank on the right side and viewing the action on this gorgeous short hole beside the @entity117 , with @entity118 shimmering in the distance			0
10 ) the packed grandstand at the @entity121			0
the massive grandstands have been a feature of every @entity46 but this year organisers have excelled themselves with the first wraparound stand in history around the final hole			1
should be spine - tingling come sunday .			2

@entity8 begins at @entity7 on *thursday*
three - time champion @entity10 plays despite *recent* injury *problems*
@entity59 defends the title he won at @entity30 last year
@entity40 must show consistency if he is to win his first @entity46
