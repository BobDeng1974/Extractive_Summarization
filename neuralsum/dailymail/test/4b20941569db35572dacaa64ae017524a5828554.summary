they are : @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity54			0
@entity2 took some flak last month after a series of poor performances for @entity3 , but his goalscoring has never waivered and even through a difficult period he managed six goals in 10 games , the sort of record most strikers can only dream of			1
and his displays across the season have brought more goals than the likes of @entity47 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity72			2
the first three of his five goals against @entity5 marked the quickest hat - trick of his career , coming in just eight first half minutes			2
another followed 16 minutes later , and his last came 35 minutes after that			0
@entity2 's displays across the season have brought more goals than the likes of @entity70 and @entity72 it all adds up to a brilliant @entity84 for the world 's best player , and he spoke of his delight afterwards @entity24 and @entity88 came out on top in @entity90 but he has fewer league goals than @entity2 @entity70 , who can boast @entity93 among their ranks , have fewer goals than the @entity3 talisman while @entity2 overtook @entity24 on the goalscoring charts , the hat - trick - which could have been doubled - levelled the @entity100 's record of 24 @entity7 trebles			1
he almost matched @entity3 legend @entity101 's 28 hat - tricks for @entity3 in what was their biggest league win in 48 - and - a - half years			1
it all adds up to a brilliant @entity84 for the world 's best player , and he posted on @entity107 after the game , saying : ' happy to have scored 5 goals with this excellent team work			2
thank you for all your support			0
' if the critics still see @entity2 as greedy , it certainly paid off at the @entity115 on sunday			0
