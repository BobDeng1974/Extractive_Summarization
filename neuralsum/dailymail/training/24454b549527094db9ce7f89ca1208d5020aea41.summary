maybe it ’s his enormous , bulging brown eyes			0
or the permanently wrinkled up - turned nose			2
or it could be his pointy , over-sized ears			0
there ’s little doubt that @entity8 , a diminutive five - month - old @entity10 bulldog , has a certain @entity11			1
‘ most people associate bulldogs exclusively with @entity14 , but this one ’s different and definitely full of character , ’ says @entity8 ’s besotted owner , @entity15 , a 31 - year - old marketing director from @entity16			1
‘ i ca n’t walk him down the street without people stopping and admiring him			0
’ all ears : @entity10 bulldogs are loved for their comical looks they are n’t the only ones			1
the @entity10 bulldog — a kind of ‘ bulldog - lite ’ which emerged in the 19th century when traditional bulldogs were mated with pugs and terriers to create a miniature version — is one of the fastest growing breeds in @entity35 , with owners willing to pay £ 1,000 for one			1
last year , the @entity37 received 6,990 new @entity10 bulldog registrations — an increase of 49 per cent on the previous year and of more than 1,000 per cent compared to ten years ago			1
enthusiasm for ‘ frenchies ’ as fans call them , far exceeds enthusiasm for traditional @entity35 bulldogs — the @entity37 had a thousand fewer registrations for the @entity35 breed			1
celebrity owners include the @entity49 , whose @entity50 is a regular fixture on @entity54 ’s @entity53 page — as well as fashion designer @entity55 , former made in @entity57 star @entity58 and the @entity60 - winning actress @entity59			1
x-men star @entity61 is rarely seen without his cream - coloured @entity10 bulldog @entity64 , while @entity66 singer @entity65 is devoted to her @entity10 bulldog @entity68			1
so what is it about the @entity50 that has turned it into the dog du jour ? x-men star @entity61 is rarely seen without his cream - coloured @entity10 bulldog @entity64 certainly not their looks			1
with their squashed snouts , bulging eyes , stocky bodies and squat spindly legs , they ’re unlikely to win any beauty prizes			0
but for owners , their comical appearance is part of the charm			2
‘ they are known as the clowns of the canines , and it ’s so true , ’ says @entity88 , a 27 - year - old beauty writer from @entity89 , whose dog is five - year - old @entity91			2
fans often post photos online of their frenchies dressed up to look as ridiculous as possible			0
some dogs have become celebrities in their own right			0
sir @entity102 , a 21 - month - old cream @entity50 , appeared on a range of canine ‘ hoodies ’ after his owners set up an @entity109 photo account that attracted 200,000 followers on the picture - sharing site			2
another , @entity113 , has nearly 190,000			0
he is beloved for his exhaustive collection of hats			0
@entity116 are particularly well - suited to owners who live in cities and work long hours			2
they rarely grow taller than 12 inches or weigh much more than 2st , and dislike extreme temperatures , so are suited to indoor - living			2
they enjoy human company , are affectionate with owners , and good with children			0
it ’s not the first time @entity98 have experienced a moment in the spotlight			0
they were all the rage in mid- 19th century @entity10			1
despite their name , the dogs partly originated in @entity35			2
they were introduced to the @entity133 by @entity135 ’s lace workers who , displaced by machinery after the @entity137 , moved to @entity138 in search of work			0
in @entity35 , breeders had seen their size as a defect , but by the 1850s in @entity10 , they had become a @entity145 must - have , known as ‘ bouledogues francais ’ and popular among artists , writers and high - society ladies			1
their return to favour now fits with a longer - term trend for diminutive breeds , or ‘ handbag dogs ’ , which has already seen chihuahuas , pugs and miniature poodles enjoy a place in the spotlight			2
@entity37 secretary @entity159 says : ‘ people see a picture of a celebrity out carrying a small dog and want one , too			1
’ but although responsibly - bred frenchies can enjoy long and healthy lives , living for more than a decade , the breed is prone to health problems			2
their short snouts and compact heads , the result of centuries of selective breeding , mean their airways are compacted			0
they struggle to regulate their temperature , and find breathing in warm weather difficult			0
exposure to extreme heat can be lethal			0
a @entity10 bulldog has his teeth cleaned at the @entity183 pet parlour they also have notoriously delicate digestive systems , a reputation for flatulence and a tendency to allergies			1
@entity10 bulldogs can suffer spine and knee pain , and tend to suffer eye problems , such as glaucoma , corneal ulcers and cataracts			1
the @entity37 has a register of ‘ assured ’ breeders on its website , who have been checked over and will only register certain colours of the breed — ‘ brindle ’ , a mix of coloured and black hairs , such as @entity8 and @entity91 ; ‘ pied ’ , predominantly white ; and ‘ fawn ’ , similar to brindle but with black eyelashes and rims			1
other colours , such as the grey - black ‘ blue ’ bulldog beloved of celebrities are not approved because they often suffer from a condition which can result in hair loss and chronic skin inflammation			2
@entity50 fans insist that - when properly looked after , this is a breed which can rival any other and breeders with no @entity37 affiliation advertise @entity10 bulldog puppies online — including @entity222 — for anything from £ 500 to £ 1,600			1
frequently , they are based abroad			0
some unscrupulous @entity224 breed them in pitiful conditions , and because pets from the @entity228 no longer need to be quarantined , smuggling puppies has never been easier			0
last year , the number of dogs coming from @entity232 increased by more than 1,000 per cent			1
another unexpected side - effect of the craze has been the recent wave in bulldog thefts			2
in february , a seven - month - old @entity10 bulldog puppy was stolen from a garden in @entity239 , but was recovered two weeks later			1
a month earlier , a five - month - old @entity10 bulldog was stolen from a home in @entity242			1
and a man wielding a knife seized a two - year - old @entity10 bulldog from a home in @entity247 in december			1
@entity50 fans insist that — when properly looked after , this is a breed which can rival any other			0
‘ with careful , knowledgeable breeding and care , they can be healthy , lovable , funny little dogs with huge personalities and with no more or less problems than your average @entity255 , ’ adds @entity88			0
as for @entity91 ’s status as a fashion icon — it ’s just an added bonus			0
‘ i can see why they ’ve stolen the hearts of so many			0
@entity91 ’s my best friend and i adore her			0
