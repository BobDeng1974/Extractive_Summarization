@entity0 is a player who could form @entity2 ’s attack for years to come , according to manager @entity3			1
the 18 - year - old striker came off the bench to score an impressive first goal of his senior career at @entity8 on east monday			1
it took him level with a @entity2 legend of the same surname : his dad @entity13 , a scorer just once in 408 games for the club			0
@entity0 celebrates after scoring his first senior goal for @entity2 away to @entity8 a source of mirth around the dinner table ? quite probably , although the younger @entity0 still has some way to go to match his father ’s feats			1
he has managed just 56 minutes in his fledgling career so far , a distance from the 858 senior games , including 59 @entity27 caps , of @entity28			2
still , the game is about goals … true , and @entity31 ’s was a peach , controlling a high ball in an instant , shimmying past a defender , and rifling a left - foot shot into the net			0
it was curiously similar to his old man ’s only goal , coming on @entity42 1992 against @entity43			0
he too smashed in an angled shot with his left			0
the younger @entity0 could already have passed his tally had he done better than skew wide a glorious chance at @entity49			2
the 18 - year - old attacker is son of former @entity27 and @entity2 defender @entity51 he seems the real deal though , not just daddy ’s boy made good through connections ? that paternal link may have helped initially but since entering the @entity2 academy @entity0 has proved his pedigree			1
he began the season in @entity60 's under - 18 squad , and made a sizeable impression in january by firing a hat - trick against @entity63 in the @entity65 fourth round			2
he progressed to @entity2 ’s under - 21s and scored seven goals in 13 starts , leading @entity3 to take notice and offer a chance following injuries to @entity72 , @entity73 and @entity74			2
@entity0 made his debut in the final minute of @entity2 ’s 2 - 0 win over @entity77 on march 18 , at the same age his dad did under @entity80 31 years earlier			1
@entity0 scored a goal of the highest quality as he twisted and turned before firing past @entity83 @entity3 presumably knows a good striker when he finds one … the @entity2 manager is a huge fan of the teenager , hyping him up rather than playing things down			1
‘ i believe he can play for the club for a very long time and make the striker 's role his in the very near future , ’ @entity3 said after the draw against @entity8			1
‘ i am pleased to stand here and say , “ you have a wonderful young asset at the football club who is only going to get better ”			0
‘ the biggest advantage is that he is a very well - rounded , level - headed boy that turns up every day and works hard			0
if he has that mindset then you have a chance			0
’ what are his attributes ? as displayed by his goal , @entity0 is two - footed and possesses good balance			1
he is quick , an intelligent runner , and a smart finisher			0
he also has a striker ’s mentality			0
as part of the @entity65 hat - trick he won an argument with team - mate @entity116 over who would take a penalty , going on to score			0
the youngest is highly thought of by @entity2 boss @entity3 , who believes he has a big future			1

@entity0 came off the bench to score his first goal against @entity8
the 18 - year - old is son of former @entity27 *international* @entity51
manager @entity3 believes the forward has a bright future
