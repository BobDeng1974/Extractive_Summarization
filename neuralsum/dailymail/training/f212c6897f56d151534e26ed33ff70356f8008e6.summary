by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 04:52 est , 13 january 2014 updated : 11:22 est , 14 january 2014 as smartphones become cheaper and more available , instant messaging is on the rise , while the number of texts sent falls dramatically @entity8 ! the text message is on its way out a little over 20 years after it arrived to revolutionise how the world communicates			1
new and cheaper ‘ instant message ’ alternatives available from smartphones connected to the web , such as @entity15 and @entity16 , are taking over			1
the first text was sent on december 3 , 1992 , when @entity20 engineer @entity19 , 22 , used his computer to send the message ‘ @entity23 ’ to a mobile phone			1
the number of texts sent in @entity20 peaked at 39.7billion in 2011 , having sparked the new language of text speak , from @entity8 ( @entity8 ) to @entity28 ) and @entity29 , meaning hugs and kisses			1
however , this year the number is predicted to fall to 21billion , less than half the 50billion ‘ instant messages ’ that will be sent			0
the pattern is being repeated around the world , where the number of texts sent last year is thought to have fallen by seven billion to 145billion			1
the beauty of the instant message is that it can be sent cheaply through a smartphone app over the internet , rather than as a phone message via the mobile network , which can cost 15p a time			0
users , so far mainly teenagers , can also communicate with several people simultaneously and punctuate their messages with brightly coloured icons			2
@entity15 , which is estimated to be used by up to half of all schoolchildren , allows users to send images , videos or text – known as snaps – that disappear from the recipient ’s phone after a maximum of ten seconds			2
but the app has sparked concern over its use by teenagers for sending explicit pictures of themselves , a practice known as sexting			0
the figures highlighting the rise of the instant message are included in a study by accountants @entity68			0
a spokesman said : ‘ we have reached a tipping point			0
but the usage of mobile phones to send messages is stronger than ever			0
this year , trillions of instant messages will be sent in place of a text message			0
’ according to the telecom prediction survey , the number of texts sent last year fell 7bn to 145bn , while the number of instant messages sent through apps rose to 160bn			1
head of telecoms research at @entity68 , @entity86 , said : ' while text messaging has been growing in volume since it started , it has to come to an end of it 's heyday			1
the number of @entity93 messages sent is predicted to make a steady decline , while the number of instant messages sent is set to increase dramatically			0
factors are thought to be both financial and generational ' there has been a moderate decline in text volumes for a couple of years , and what 's driving it is growth in alternative services like @entity16 , @entity15 and mobile e-mail			1
' this means that there have been declining revenues from text recently , with more people being inclined to take out mobile broadband packages			2
' companies losing revenue from falling sms use will be able to make it up in an increase of broadband packages , and we 're predicting that mobile broadband revenue will overtake text revenue for the first time			2
' experts say the reason for this is costs			0
texts cost 10p to send , with a bit less to deliver , and @entity128 apps like @entity16 are free for the time being			1
@entity86 said : ' quite a few @entity128 services have no profit - many are in a start - up phase right now			2
@entity16 has 400 million users a month , and charges 60p a year to use it			2
' @entity136 is free with an @entity137			0
@entity15 is accumulating users rather than charging them , whereas text messaging costs money			1
' some of the companies charge for things like emoticons and games , they 're diversifying significantly , but they 're still looking at ways to generate revenue			0
' @entity93 still makes up around 98 per cent of revenue for mobile phone companies , because everybody still uses it across the world			0
' i think it 'll continue to exist because for now its the common denominator in all mobile phones ' @entity86 said			0
' unless something else comes up that takes over as the common denominator then its safe - if you want to get a message to someone you have to use sms			0
the report predicts that in 2014 the number of texts sent will fall even further to only 140bn , while the number of instant messages will increase dramatically to around 300bn			2
@entity16 ( left ) , which was released in 2009 , has since overtaken sms as the predominant form of messaging in the @entity20 , and @entity136 ( right ) , which was released on the @entity137 in 2007 , was one of the first most readily available @entity128 services , following on from @entity171 's @entity170 it is thought that younger users are turning away from traditional texting in favour of instant messaging services that offer lower prices and more customisation			1
in addition , the cheapness and availability of smartphone technology is contributing towards the rise of @entity128 , with cheaper handsets meaning more people who would n't usually buy smartphones , like senior citizens , are becoming regular users			1
the price of the technology also means that soon mobile phone companies will stop making traditional handsets , and people will have no choice but to convert to smartphones			1
in the @entity20 the percentage of people over 55 with a smartphone was 29 per cent in 2012 , and is set to rise to around 47 per cent in 2014			1
however , only 13 per cent of older smartphone owners used @entity128 , preferring to use their smartphones to make calls and send texts			1
suggestions show that it could be a generation gap that makes the difference			0
@entity86 said : ' @entity128 is a tremendous utility for delivering messages for nothing			0
' for young people its phenomenal , because it 's free and they have devices to utilise this			0
' @entity93 is still worth around £ 60bn , because of its functionality ; texts still work in any country , on any network , on any handset			0
traditional sms still stands to make more money in 2014 than @entity128 , and the report predicts that this trend will continue until 2018			2
@entity171 can claim to have started the @entity128 trend when its @entity170 service started in 2006 , but the @entity128 trend took off when the @entity137 was released in 2007			0
this release brought with it services like @entity136 , @entity227 and @entity16 , released in 2009 , with these services overtaking traditional texts in the @entity20 last year			1
a @entity231 spokesperson said : ' with the massive increase in popularity of instant messaging apps , it ’s not surprising that the number of texts sent has fallen so dramatically			1
' consumers are no longer tied to text messages or phone calls as a means of communication and are using free messaging services like @entity16 , @entity136 , @entity244 and @entity245 instead			1
' we ’ve seen significant change across our stores as customers are more interested in enquiring about a tariff ’s data limits - and whether a phone comes with a free messaging app or function pre-installed - as opposed to the number of text messages and minutes available .			2

number of texts sent in the @entity20 has fallen for the first time in two decades
@entity128 apps like @entity16 are more appealing to younger users
predictions say text messaging will decrease further in the @entity20 in 2014
@entity268 of smartphones means more people might have to convert
