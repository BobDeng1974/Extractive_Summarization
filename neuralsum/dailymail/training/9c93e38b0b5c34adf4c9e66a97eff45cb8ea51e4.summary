meanwhile , women who are overweight but make positive statements about their bodies are much more likeable			0
many people believe engaging in such self - deprecating dialogue helps initiate and strengthen social bonds with other women - but research from the @entity17 and @entity18 at the @entity19 in @entity20 , @entity21 , proves this may not be the case			1
women who engage in self - disparaging conversation about food , exercise and bodies are less liked by their peers @entity30 , research associate professor of psychology and director of the lab , asked women aged between 18 to 25 to study other women looking at photographs of themselves			0
the women looking at the photos who made ' fat talk ' about themselves , whether they were overweight or not , were rated significantly less likeable by the women studying them			2
whereas , the women who were overweight but made positive statements about their bodies were rated as more likeable			0
women who are self - deprecating about their bodies are less popular among peers than those who are happy about their size , even if they are overweight @entity49 , who presented the study at the @entity52 annual conference , said : ' though it has become a regular part of everyday conversation , " fat talk " is far from innocuous			1
' it is strongly associated with , and can even cause , body dissatisfaction , which is a known risk factor for the development of eating disorders			2
' ' though it has become a regular part of everyday conversation , " fat talk " is far from innocuous : it is strongly associated with body dissatisfaction , which is a known risk factor for the development of eating disorders ' many people believe that engaging in ' fat talk ' helps endear themselves to others and strengthens friendships			1
@entity49 added : ' these findings are important because they raise awareness about how women actually are being perceived when they engage in this self - abasing kind of talk			0
' this knowledge can be used to help national efforts to reduce " fat talking " on college campuses			0

overweight women happy with their size much more popular
