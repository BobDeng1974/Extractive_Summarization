locked up : @entity0 is spending £ 35million jailing @entity2 nationals so the country has time to build new prisons @entity0 is spending £ 35million every year locking up @entity2 who should be in jail in their own country – because its prisons are full			1
there are almost 900 @entity2 convicts in our packed prisons – the largest foreign contingent , according to the @entity15			1
but under a deal agreed by the last @entity19 government , none will have to serve their sentences back home until at least december 2016 to give @entity2 time to build new jails			1
the deal is one of a string of similar arrangements between @entity0 and the rest of the @entity28 for so - called compulsory prisoner transfer agreements			0
these allow criminals convicted of crimes in the @entity0 , who have at least six months to serve , to be forcibly removed to serve their sentences overseas			1
similar deals are in place with @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity37			0
a total of 1,064 inmates are eligible to be transferred			0
but by the end of last year , only 16 had been sent to prisons in @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 and the @entity45			1
at the end of 2012 , none had been sent home at all			0
ministers insist the situation will improve as the agreements bed in			0
with prison places costing around £ 40,000 a year , the government is desperate to save money by making greater use of the transfer deals			1
it would also create more room in @entity0 ’s own packed prisons , which have only 2,000 spare places			1
last night @entity61 , of the @entity62 , said : ‘ with so much crime committed by @entity0 people who we ca n’t simply deport , sending foreign criminals home should be an easy decision			2
instead , one in eight prisoners are foreign nationals			0
‘ these figures show an improvement upon @entity19 ’s poor record , but far more needs to be done			2
making foreign criminals face justice in their own countries would free up about 11,000 prison places for serious repeat offenders who are getting off with community service or a suspended sentence			1
’ the number of @entity2 inmates has rocketed since the country joined the @entity28 in 2004			2
in the last 12 months , @entity2 has overtaken @entity85 as the nation with the most citizens in @entity0 jails			1
of the 876 @entity2 behind bars , 320 are eligible for the prisoner transfer deal			2
they will begin being sent to serve their time in @entity2 in december 2016 when it should have more cells			1
expenditure : a prison place costs £ 40,000 - an expense the government want to cut ( library image ) @entity0 has no prisoner transfer arrangement with @entity85 , which has a permanent opt - out			1
prisons minister @entity102 said : ‘ the 1,064 figure of foreign national prisoners potentially eligible for compulsory transfer to their home countries includes around 700 who ca n’t yet be returned because we ’re waiting for implementation of the agreement from their home countries or because we ’re waiting for them to improve prison capacity			1
‘ of the remaining 300 , we are processing over 100 and the remaining 200 will be dealt with this year			0
prior to 2013 , not one prisoner had left the country under a compulsory transfer agreement			0
we expect more than a hundred to go in 2014			0
’ @entity121 has personally pledged to increase the number of foreign criminals sent home			2
last year , the prime minister said : ‘ when people are sent to prison we should do everything to make sure that if they ’re foreign , they are sent back to their country to serve their sentence			1
‘ it is not good enough , the situation we have in @entity0 today			0
’ no one from the @entity2 @entity135 was available for comment last night			2
@entity137 , left , was given a life sentence for the death of @entity140 , right , this year @entity2 @entity140 and @entity137 are serving life behind bars for the savage murder of her four - year - old son @entity140 in @entity146			1
the couple , who moved to @entity0 from @entity2 , tortured and killed @entity140 in a campaign of cruelty that culminated in his death from a head injury in march 2012			2
he died completely emaciated , locked in a cold room on a soiled mattress			0
in horrific court testimony , it was revealed that @entity137 , 28 , and her 34 - year - old partner @entity140 starved @entity140 , force - fed him salt and held the child under water			0
@entity160 had already been jailed in this country three times and arrested at least six times for offences including assault and burglary			0
but despite his serial offending , he was never put on a plane back to @entity2 – leaving him free to kill @entity140			1
in august last year , the couple were both sentenced to a minimum of 30 years , and are eligible for the compulsory prisoner transfer agreement			0
@entity137 ’s term is one of the longest jail terms given to a woman in @entity0 , the same as child - killer @entity177 and exceeded by only @entity178 and @entity179			0
the cost of keeping @entity140 and @entity137 locked up in a @entity0 jail is around £ 80,000 a year			1
if both serve their entire sentence here , the bill to the taxpayer will be a minimum of £ 2.4million			2
yesterday , it emerged they had been refused leave to appeal			0
lawyers say they plan to continue their legal fight .			0
