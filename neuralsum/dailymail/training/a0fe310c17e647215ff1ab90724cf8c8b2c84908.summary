by @entity0 the @entity1 might have a reputation for prim propriety but it seems that was n't always the case , as a recently rediscovered cache of 18th century tiles reveals			2
kept under lock and key since their discovery in a @entity14 pub in 1962 , the reliefs offer an explicit peek into @entity17 bedrooms and prove that far from being strait - laced , the 18th century was a considerably more risque place than previously thought			1
now the tiles are to go on display for the first time during a late night event at the @entity24 , although , as you might expect , it 's strictly for those aged over 18			1
@entity28 : one of the set of eight erotic 18th century tiles discovered after a fire in a @entity14 pub @entity33 : city of seduction gives visitors a peek into the bedrooms of @entity33 's historical inhabitants , with @entity41 rituals , ancient erotic sculpture and @entity17 prostitutes among the stars of the show			1
but even the raciest of @entity41 would find it hard to outdo the 18th century tiles , most of which offer viewers graphic depictions of couples enthusiastically indulging in the pleasures of the flesh			2
' erotic material – such as these relief tiles – was widely available in the 18th century , if one knew where to go and had the means with which to acquire it , ' explains curator , @entity61			2
' for obvious reasons these tiles are not normally out on public display so we are pleased to show the complete set for the first time ever - just down the road from where they were discovered			1
' fragments : some of the tiles are broken and in poor condition because of the fire raunchy : although some show a moment of post-coital bliss , many more are extremely explicit she is history 's most famous lesbian , best known for a series of lyrical poems that speak of her mostly unrequited love for other women			1
now papyrus fragments discovered in the head of a mummy by @entity87 papyrologist dr @entity88 have revealed that the poet was a devoted sister as well an ardent lover			2
one causing particular excitement among historians is a poem that speaks of her love for brother @entity96 who is gently teased for being in love with an @entity99 slave girl			0
touchingly , it also includes an exhortation to pray to [ goddess ] @entity102 ' so that @entity96 may return here , with his ship intact ; for the rest let us leave it all to the gods , for often calm quickly follows a great storm			0
' whether @entity96 did indeed make it home to his sister , frustratingly , remains unknown			0
unlike @entity61 , the descendants of the @entity17 tile makers did n't appear to be quite so appreciative , with the reliefs hidden by layers of obscuring plaster during the @entity119 period			0
the tiles only came to light again after a fire at the @entity124 pub in 1962 but , thanks to their explicit content , were swiftly bundled into a vault by the team that found them			1
now they have been uncovered once more and are currently being studied by historians , who believe that the tiles , found in an upstairs room , were used to decorate a fireplace			0
quite why the fireplace required such racy decoration is more of a mystery , although researchers believe they could have been intended for temporary use , put up when the room was being used as a brothel or as the haunt of a men 's drinking club			0
' @entity33 has always been a hotbed for the seductive , saucy and down - right sordid , ' added @entity61			0
' from the bath - houses of @entity149 and the stews of medieval @entity151 to the @entity152 and @entity154 ’s swinging sixties , this city has long traded in the currency of sex			0
' @entity33 : city of @entity158 , @entity159 from 7pm at the @entity24 oh matron ! the tiles so horrified the 1960s team that discovered them , they 've been locked away ever since			1

the tiles were discovered in 1962 but kept hidden because of the content

will be displayed during a @entity159 late night event at the *museum*
