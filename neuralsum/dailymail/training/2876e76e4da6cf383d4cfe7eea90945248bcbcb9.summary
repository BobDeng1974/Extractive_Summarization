by @entity0 and @entity1 for @entity2 follow @ @ riathalsam @entity4 world champion boxer @entity3 is in hospital in @entity6 after being stabbed in the leg while on holiday			1
blood was left spattered in the street after the 28 - year - old was attacked at 6am today following a night out in the @entity14 island 's popular tourist resort of @entity15			1
he was visiting with his pregnant wife @entity16 just two weeks after being named the @entity18 's welterweight world champion in a tense fight in @entity20			1
the boxer , from @entity45 , had been enjoying a night out in @entity46 when the attack happened			1
an eyewitness to the aftermath told @entity50 the attack left a trail of blood 100m long , leading to an apartment where an ambulance was called			1
by @entity55 the 28 - year - old won a career - defining victory last month when he defeated rival @entity58 in @entity60			1
the @entity45 star had already been through a long career which included 32 professional fights before earning his shot at the @entity18 welterweight title			1
challenging legendary @entity66 as early as 2010 , he nevertheless faced a slow rise from fighting in leisure centres to filling out arenas			0
victory over @entity72 veteran @entity71 two years ago moved him into position to fight then - champion @entity74 , but injuries to both men saw the fight postponed three times and eventually cancelled			1
instead , he faced the undefeated @entity58 , ousting the champion to become the sixth @entity80 to hold a world title in the division and the first since @entity85 's brief stint in 2006			1
@entity3 was being treated tonight at @entity6 's @entity87 hospital as police remained at the scene of the attack			1
a spokesman for the @entity14 police , the @entity91 , said : ' this morning a 28 - year - old @entity4 man was stabbed at @entity95 in @entity96			2
' he was stabbed in the left leg and is hospitalised			2
he lost a lot of blood			2
' there are no arrests at this time and the @entity91 are investigating			0
' @entity3 was on holiday with his heavily - pregnant wife , @entity16 , who is expecting their second child			1
she left earlier in the evening and was not present when the altercation happened			2
@entity3 ’s promoter @entity109 has not yet been able to speak to the boxer but said he planned to fly out to @entity6 tonight			2
he said : ‘ i will be flying out tonight to see what is going on			0
we are all worried about what has happened			0
' there are a lot of stories out there so let ’s just wait and see			0
i am told he is stable			2
’ it is the second time @entity3 has been stabbed after he was attacked outside a nightclub in @entity45 in 2007			1
he was leaving the @entity122 when he was stabbed in the side and buttocks			0
his trainer at the time , @entity125 , said he had been attacked by ‘ kids from a car that pulled up ’ next to him			0
@entity3 returned to fight six months later and has since amassed a perfect record of 33 fights and 33 wins			0
in action : @entity3 turned in a gutsy display to beat @entity58 and line up a potential fight against @entity134 champion : the fighter won a world title just two weeks ago ( pictured ) and was on holiday with his wife he won the @entity18 world title from @entity141 @entity58 in @entity20 last month , and was being lined up this week for a major fight next spring against two - time world champion @entity134			1
@entity109 wrote in a column for @entity2 earlier this week : ' talks are ongoing over a fight between @entity3 and @entity134			0
it is going well because i think everyone realises it makes sense			0
' @entity134 obviously wants a fight with @entity152 , as does everyone in the division , but he knows that while that fight might never happen , even if it did he would make more money fighting @entity3			0
‘ everything so far has been very straightforward and i am in talks with @entity159 over a may date			0
they want us back there as soon as possible after the success of @entity165 – i have no doubt in my mind that we would fill that stadium again			0
i hope to have this tied up in the next month or so			0
’ @entity109 failed with a previous £ 3million offer to @entity134 to fight @entity3 , but the situation is believed to have changed after the boxer 's world title win			1
@entity3 's promoter said : ' there are a lot of stories out there so let ’s just wait and see			0
i am told he is stable ’ in training : brook on a run in his hometown of @entity45 in 2010			1
he has enjoyed a steady rise to fame rising : @entity3 is unbeaten in 33 fights			0
he was scheduled to return to the ring in december before the attack			2
