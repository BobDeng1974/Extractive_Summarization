@entity1 militants are changing tactics in the face of @entity5 - led air strikes in @entity6 by ditching conspicuous convoys in favour of motorcycles			1
the jihadists have also taken to erecting their notorious black flag on the rooftops of residential houses and buildings , many of them empty , to create confusion about their actual presence			1
tribal sources and eyewitnesses have reported fewer militant checkpoints to weed out ' apostates ' and less cell phone use since the air strikes intensified and more @entity5 allies pledged to join the campaign that began in august			2
a tribal sheikh from a village south of @entity29 said @entity1 elements ' abandoned one of their biggest headquarters in the village ' when they heard the air strike campaign was likely to target their area			0
then they planted roadside bombs and destroyed the headquarters , ' said the tribal sheikh who declined to be named			0
' they do n't move in military convoys like before			0
instead they use motorcycles , bicycles , and if necessary , they use camouflaged cars , ' he said			0
civilian casualties are a major concern as @entity5 war planes venture deeper into the @entity63 valley and to @entity6 's western desert in the name of breaking @entity1 's grip on mostly @entity68 parts of @entity6 -- nearly one - third of the country			1
@entity70 has also taken part in the air campaign			0
tribal and local intelligence sources said an air strike yesterday near @entity75 , 20 km ( 12 miles ) south of @entity29 , had killed two local senior @entity1 leaders while they were receiving a group of militants from @entity79 and @entity80			0
ongoing fighting makes it impossible to verify the reports			0
a @entity5 - led coalition has started bombing the militants in @entity79 as well , fearing the @entity68 extremist group could threaten national security from a caliphate they have declared in territory seized there and through the border into @entity6			1
@entity91 allies have joined in and this week @entity92 and @entity93 both pledged fighter jets to @entity6 but not @entity79			2
in another village near @entity97 in northern @entity6 , a source said the militants had ditched the use of long convoys of conspicuous vehicles with mounted machine guns and also noted their new preference for motorbikes			2
@entity1 fighters , who have controlled much of @entity79 's eastern oil and agricultural provinces for more than a year , swept through mainly @entity108 regions of north @entity6 in mid-june , seizing cities including @entity80 and @entity110 and halting less than 100 miles ( 160 km ) from the capital @entity112			2
two @entity5 @entity114 @entity113 fly over @entity6 after conducting air strikes in @entity79 earlier this week			1
further bombing runs have targeted @entity118 oil installations and bases in a bid to cripple the group 's revenue stream aerial bombardment : the @entity5 @entity114 @entity113 are part of a coalition strike force that aims to roll back and ultimately crush the extremist group that has created a caliphate spanning the @entity79 - @entity6 border but their recent moves suggest they are worried about the air strikes , which are backed on the ground by a largely hapless @entity6 army but a more formidable @entity134 peshmerga force			1
' they were executing people like drinking water ... now the air strikes are very active and have decreased the ( militants ' ) ability , ' @entity138 , the head of his tribe in @entity29 and across @entity6 , told @entity144			2
' wherever they hide , people want to get rid of them because they 're afraid their houses will be struck , ' said @entity138 , who fled to @entity134 this summer after @entity1 blew up his home			0
the insurgents have gone underground in their main @entity79 stronghold since @entity5 president @entity151 authorised @entity5 air strikes on the group in @entity79 - which began earlier this week			1
they have disappeared from streets , redeployed weapons and fighters , and cut down their media exposure , residents said			0
the air strikes have by no means crippled them			0
their fighters edged towards a strategic town on northern @entity79 's border with @entity166 on friday , battling @entity134 forces , while air strikes hit their oilfields and bases in @entity79 's east			1
pit stop : a @entity5 @entity114 @entity173 receives fuel from a @entity175 over northern @entity6 after conducting airstrikes in @entity79 earlier this week in the eastern @entity6 province of @entity179 , an eyewitness said the air strikes had forced the militants to cut back the number of checkpoints which inspected identity cards , looking for those they considered ' apostates ' : shi'ites , policemen , soldiers			1
' they have also increased the number of headquarters , instead of two , they now have 20 , with only 3 - 4 people in each one of them , ' said the eyewitness			2
an eyewitness in @entity195 town in @entity179 also said the militants had decreased their presence on the frontline , no longer confronting army troops with large numbers			0
in @entity110 , police colonel @entity201 said the militants had withdrawn their checkpoints from main thoroughfares in the city , retreating to side streets			0
' they have also switched cars between the areas they control and our intelligence indicates that they have all changed their cell phones			0
these are always shut and the batteries are removed unless they need to use them , ' @entity201 told @entity144			0
in perhaps the most obvious indication the militants are wary of the strikes , they have taken to digging and hiding in trenches -- just big enough for two people -- in residents ' backyards			0

blitzed : a graphic showing some of the most recent @entity5 / @entity91 air strikes carried out in @entity79 and @entity6 it said air raids also targeted the headquarters of the @entity267 in the town of @entity269			1
another activist collective , the @entity271 , also reported four strikes on @entity269 that it said were conducted by the coalition			2
the @entity256 , which relies on a network of activists inside @entity79 , said there were reports of casualties in the strikes , but did not have concrete figures			0
the @entity5 - led coalition , which began its aerial campaign against @entity1 fighters in @entity79 early tuesday , aims to roll back and ultimately crush the extremist group that has created a caliphate spanning the @entity79 - @entity6 border			1
along the way , the militants have massacred captured @entity79 and @entity6 troops , terrorized minorities in both countries and beheaded two @entity5 journalists and a @entity93 aid worker			1
