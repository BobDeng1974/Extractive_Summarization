by @entity0 published : 17:53 est , 1 august 2013 updated : 02:22 est , 2 august 2013 respite : motorists in rural areas could be set to benefit from a @entity5 subsidy cutting fuel duty for drivers in rural areas could lead to a postcode lottery , ministers were warned yesterday			1
isolated areas of @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 are among those earmarked to benefit from a 5p discount on their fuel			1
the scheme , which already operates in the @entity21 islands and @entity22 , reflects the increased costs of transporting fuel to remote areas for a small number of people			1
but trying to extend it to mainland @entity31 by drawing lines around certain rural areas will be ‘ very difficult ’ , @entity29 president @entity28 warned			1
he said : ‘ on an island you have no other choice of where to buy petrol so there is not a postcode lottery , but this will mean garages on the other side of the @entity44 ( for example ) from the designated zone may go out of business			0
it will be difficult to set up			2
’ ministers plan to cut fuel duty for garages in remote areas from 53p to 48p a litre in the hope they will pass the saving on to their customers and help boost the rural economy			1
the @entity56 has said rural petrol stations can apply for the rebate if they have to charge more than 139p per litre for unleaded fuel and 145.5p for diesel			0
however mr @entity28 said drivers in cut - off areas of @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65 had already contacted him to complain that their areas were unlikely to meet the threshold			0
he added : ‘ it is certainly welcome for people in these areas , and it is a fact that if you are a garage in a rural area and you get fewer customers then you have to charge more			0
but you get 5p price disparities along one section of the @entity77 just outside @entity78			0
variation : people living in rural areas typically pay more for their fuel than those who live in towns ‘ it would be better if the pricing was more transparent			2
‘ and we would like to see the government publish wholesale prices as they do in other countries			0
’ a fuel duty cut for some areas is defined as state aid , so the government needs to persuade the @entity94 it will not breach state competition laws			2
rebates have been granted in other islands , including @entity98 and some @entity100 and @entity101 islands , but offering it to certain areas on the mainland is more complicated			1
determined : chief secretary to the treasury @entity105 ( left ) says he will do everything he can to ' make this happen ' , but @entity29 president @entity28 ( right ) warned it would be ' very difficult ' to extend the scheme the current rebate scheme currently allows petrol stations in the @entity114 and @entity115 , the @entity116 , the @entity117 of the @entity118 and the @entity22 to claim back 5p per litre relief on fuel			1
the government will collect fuel prices from 1,500 retailers in 36 remote areas over the next five weeks before applying to the @entity94 in the autumn			2
the cost of the new scheme looks set to run to millions of pounds			2
treasury secretary @entity105 said : ‘ the island fuel rebate provides much - needed help to keep down fuel prices in areas where costs of transporting fuel mean prices are much higher			1
‘ we will need to prove that there are areas which are similar to the islands in terms of pump prices and distribution costs , so i would urge local areas that may qualify to provide the information we need to make the case as robust as possible			0
‘ as a @entity144 , i know that for people who live in rural areas driving is not a choice , but a necessity			0
so while it wo n’t be easy to get this agreed with the @entity94 , i want to do everything i can to make this happen			0

isolated areas of the country could be set for a @entity5 fuel subsidy
the scheme already operates in remote ares of the @entity21 islands
but an *expert* has warned it could be difficult to implement on the mainland
treasury secretary @entity105 is determined to push it through
