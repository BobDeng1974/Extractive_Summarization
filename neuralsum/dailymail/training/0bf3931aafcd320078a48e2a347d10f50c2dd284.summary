by @entity0 for @entity1 by day , dr. @entity2 was a respected , tenured professor , loved by his students and well thought of by his university colleagues			1
but by night , cops claim @entity2 lived a secret shadow life as the drug - dealing , gun - toting leader of an outlaw biker gang called the @entity11 's @entity10 ( sic )			1
when police raided the well - tended , @entity15 - style home that @entity2 shared with his beautiful blonde girlfriend in an upscale @entity18 community , it looked like an episode of tv ’s ' @entity20 ' , in which a school chemistry teacher gets sucked into a dangerous double life as a crystal meth dealer			1
@entity26 detectives seized more than a pound of methamphetamine , hand guns , rifles , a shotgun , brass knuckles , body armor , cash , leather gear with gang colors and @entity38 insignias - plus a black jacket bearing the name ' @entity41 ' , the name @entity2 goes by in the biker world			1
respectable : @entity2 , ( left ) who was professor of kinesiology at @entity47 in @entity26 , @entity18 , was loved by his students and faculty colleagues			1
they are shocked at the claims against him			0
the claims have uncanny similarities with @entity54 's character in @entity20 ( right ) ' @entity55 ' : @entity2 is alleged to be ' skinz ' the gung - toting , drug - dealing leader of the @entity11 's @entity10 gang that bust at the hq of @entity2 's alleged drug empire - and his subsequent arrest - came three years ago almost to the day			1
when @entity2 was arrested on august 26 2011 , it sent shock waves through the sprawling campus of @entity47 in @entity26 , where , for more than a decade , @entity2 , 48 , taught kinesiology , the science of human movement			1
and his arrest stunned the mild mannered professor 's neighbors in the quiet , tree - lined section of nearby @entity73 where he lived with his girlfriend @entity74 , his alleged partner in a meth dealing operation that police say raked in big bucks			1
' i was shocked ' , said one neighbor who recalls @entity2 having occasional visits from friends on motor cycles , but no rowdy parties or trouble			0
' he always seemed like a nice , friendly person			0
' @entity2 's father , @entity87 , 69 , who lives near @entity88 , described @entity2 - who was fired from his cal state teaching job in december 2012 - as a good @entity90 and a good father who does n't drink and does n't smoke			2
' i believe my son is innocent and this is all a huge mistake			2
' but cops insist there is no mistake - that quiet , reserved @entity2 , who has a 17 year - old daughter from a failed marriage , is indeed a wolf in sheep 's clothing , the allege			2
' one side of him was a successful and productive member of society , but the other side of him is an outlaw motorcycle gang leader , ' @entity109 's sgt. @entity110 - a lead investigator in the case - told reporters after @entity2 ’s arrest			2
' he was the highest ranking person in the group , without a doubt			0
' @entity110 was part of a six - month investigation called @entity119 's professor ' which was launched in 2011 when a separate probe of another biker gang - the @entity120 - stumbled upon the name ' skinz '			1

' i have kids in college and to have a professor who is a member of the @entity11 's @entity160 and allegedly dealing methamphetamine , is quite alarming - unusual , to say the least , ' said then @entity109 , @entity162 at the time			1
local detectives , working with the @entity140 , tapped @entity2 's cellphone and , after months of undercover surveillance , they concluded that he was buying crystal meth in one pound bricks and dividing it into ounce bags which mid-level dealers distributed to street dealers in the @entity26 area , some 60 miles east of @entity171			2

. and the arrest of nine other members of @entity2 's alleged drug ring , including his live - in girlfriend , @entity74			2

yet @entity2 's day in court has been scheduled and postponed more than a dozen times			0
he was due in court wednesday , but the hearing has been delayed again , due to arguments between prosecutors and defense attorneys over whether wire taps and other evidence gathered by cops over a six - month investigation are admissible in court			1
how does a man like @entity2 , whose worst encounter with cops until this point was a traffic ticket … a highly educated academic who researched the effects of video games on children and who tweeted about his concerns over childhood obesity … end up as the alleged leader of a notorious biker gang that used violence and intimidation to enforce a thriving crystal meth - dealing operation , a gang whose members wear @entity287 ( @entity288 --- @entity289 ) patches on their black leather jackets ? @entity2 's first link with a biker gang was in 1997 when he was teaching at the @entity293 where he joined the @entity294 , just as he was getting a divorce			1

he kept @entity41 , his alleged secret biker persona - and his tattoos - well hidden			2
' nobody on the faculty here at @entity47 knew that he was a member of a biker group , ' said university spokesman @entity314			0
as for @entity2 's students at @entity47 , the only clue he gave them of his alleged secret double life was his @entity319 which he often rode to work			1
while a couple of his students said @entity2 had seemed distracted just before his arrest and was sometimes late for class , the majority gave him rave reviews on the website @entity328			0

. ' awesome ' … …			0
