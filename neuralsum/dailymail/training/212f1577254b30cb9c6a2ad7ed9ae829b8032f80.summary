by @entity0 @entity1 : 21:11 est , 29 december 2013 @entity2 : 06:02 est , 30 december 2013 @entity4 officials are off sick three times more than the average @entity7 worker , it was revealed last night			2
according to official figures , @entity10 officials took an average of 14.6 days off sick last year - triple the amount taken by @entity7 workers in the private sector			1
one in seven staff were absent from more than 20 days			1
often sick : @entity4 employees , shown here on strike last year , took an average of 14.6 days sick per year in contrast , a survey by the @entity22 found @entity7 staff working in the privatesector took around five sick days a year			1
the figures also showed @entity28 officials even outstripped @entity7 ’s civil servants and public sector staff - who took half as many days off work			1
@entity32 , a prominent @entity33 mp , told the @entity34 the figures were ‘ disgraceful ’			1
he said : ‘ i ’m appalled at the waste of money			0
it is unbelievable that they are taking so much time off			0
however , nobody in truth would notice whether they are there or not			0
they have no real job , they are just pushing bits of paper around and costing taxpayers billions of pounds			0
’ @entity51 : those who work for the @entity10 , led by @entity53 ( pictured ) , have high pay and preferential tax arrangements @entity57 , of the @entity58 think tank , said that the levels of illness among @entity28 commission staff was ‘ surprising ’ given their higher pay and perks			0
he said : ‘ that @entity4 officials are off sick so often is surprising , especially when they are paid more , taxed less and tend to have better conditions than either civil servants in member states or people working in the private sector			0
‘ @entity4 staff - 14.6 sick days per year @entity7 workers ( private sector ) - 4.9 days @entity7 workers ( public sector ) - 6.9 days @entity76 workers - 19.3 days @entity28 average - 7.3 days between 3.5 and 3.7 per cent of working days were lost to sickness overall			1
but the commission said this was a figure in line with other @entity28 countries			0
the average @entity28 worker takes 7.3 days off work each year , according to figures compiled this year by @entity87 - precisely half the figure for @entity4 staff			1
only @entity76 , out of the @entity28 countries , appears to have a substantially worse sickness absence problem than @entity4 officialdom , with officials taking an average of 19.3 days off sick last year			2
according to @entity7 figures , @entity4 officials are well paid , with 16 per cent of administrative staff at the commission earning more than £ 84,000 a year			1
these are paid at low ‘ community ’ tax rates of around 20 per cent			0
on top of high wages , staff receive annual holidays of 24 days as well as seven days off for public holidays and , this year , eight ‘ non-working ’ days out of the office when the @entity107 institutions are closed in summer and at @entity108			2
many commission staff are also eligible for a ‘ flexitime ’ scheme that gives an extra 24 days off work every year for those that put in an extra 45 minutes a day in the office .			2

official figures show one is seven staff were absent for more than 20 days
comparable survey of @entity7 workers show just five days off per year
*eurosceptic* @entity125 mp @entity32 said the figures were ' disgraceful '
