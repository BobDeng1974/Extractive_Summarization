as the saying goes , some are born great , some achieve greatness , and some have greatness thrust upon them			1
now a new study claims to have proven the theory that great leaders such as sir @entity9 or @entity10 are all born - not made			1
research by a leading military academic claims to have put the debate on whether it is nature or nurture which creates greatness to bed after finding the most effective really are a breed apart , and have brains that are wired differently to most			1
a new study has backed up the theory that great leaders such as sir @entity9 or @entity10 are born - not made the discovery could revolutionise how organisations assess and develop leaders , with brain scans being used to identify those with the ' leadership gene ' early and train them accordingly			1
it seems the most successful have more grey matter in places that control decision making and memory , giving them a vital edge when it comes to making the right call			1
management expert professor @entity38 , of @entity39 in the @entity40 , said : ' once we have confirmed how the brain works in these leaders , we can create an ' expert ' profile			2
' this profile can help us develop brain training methods to enhance brain functioning in leaders , such as the neurofeedback techniques that have been successfully used with elite athletes , concert musicians and financial traders			0
' the discovery could revolutionise how organisations assess and develop leaders , with brain scans being used to identify those with the ' leadership gene ' scans of 103 volunteers from the @entity60 at @entity60 , ranging in rank from officer cadet to major , found neural networks in the frontal and prefrontal lobes of those deemed ' leaders ' were different from the rest			2
these areas of the brain are associated with self - regulation , decision making and memory			1
the study was published in the @entity75 's @entity74			0
the officers , 87 of whom were men , were defined as being more psychologically complex if they had a more diverse sense of their own abilities and accomplishments as leaders			0
in addition to a series of questions , and physical and mental tests , half underwent ' brain mapping ' - a quantitative electroencephalography scan			0
using electrodes placed on 19 different locations on subjects ' heads , researchers were able to track activity in particular areas of the brain while the participant was at rest			0
researchers also tested leadership and decision - making abilities in a hypothetical tactical military expedition			2
the participants had to lead their unit to interact with hostile and non-hostile civilians , enemy forces , the media and , eventually , the shooting down of a @entity40 helicopter during an international humanitarian relief mission in @entity111			0
former military officers with significant experience in these types of situations rated the officers ' responses to the scenario based on their adaptability , situational awareness and decisions			0
leaders who had a more complex sense of their leadership skills and greater neurological complexity were found to be more adaptive and effective leaders in these scenarios			0
prof @entity128 , a retired colonel with 26 years of experience in the @entity130 , said the results are a step toward finding out how effective and adaptable leaders not only think and act , but how their brains are wired to lead .			1

*scientists* say scans reveal leaders have brains that are wired differently
they have more grey matter controlling decision making and memory
study says it proves leaders such as @entity9 or @entity10 were born ' great '
