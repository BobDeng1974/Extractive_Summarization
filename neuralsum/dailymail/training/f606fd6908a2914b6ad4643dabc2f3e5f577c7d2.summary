the football world is still buzzing after the @entity13 's midweek performance against @entity14 in which his hat - trick earned an unexpected 3 - 2 victory			1
many pundits believe that the debate over who is the world 's best player - for so long considered a two - horse race between the two @entity23 - based global icons - now needs to include @entity3 's 26 - year - old striker			1
@entity0 celebrates after scoring a hat - trick against @entity14 in the @entity26 this week @entity0 returns to training after his heroics in midweek , ahead of sunday 's trip to @entity4 @entity31 trains , while @entity32 looks on , as @entity3 prepare for a crucial game against second - placed side @entity0 is mobbed by his @entity3 team - mates after another superb performance and while @entity5 is not ready to declare his man number one in the world just yet , the city manager firmly believes he has the potential to be precisely that			1
@entity5 said : ' i said three or four weeks ago that we are always trying to demand that @entity0 be a top player and be the best player in the world because he can do it			2
' i hope he will continue in the same way and i am sure he is one of the top five players in the world at this moment			0
' i do n't want to say he is better than @entity7 or @entity6 but he must be very near			0
' @entity0 has scored an astonishing 64 goals in his 99 @entity3 outings to date , a mark only bettered in @entity2 history by @entity55 and @entity56 over their opening century of matches			1

i do n't think anybody can replace @entity7 at @entity84 or @entity6 at @entity85 or @entity0 here			2
they are very important players			0
' it is not the same playing without @entity0 as it is playing with @entity0			0
' but i always say we have a squad and if , for some reason , @entity0 can not play , we must have another one who can do it			0
@entity5 insists his side are not a one - man team , but admits it would be more difficult without @entity0 ' we won the title last year without @entity0 for a lot of games but of course when he plays , he makes a difference			2
