@entity1 noir : professor @entity2 once aain has sparked controversy by creating a strain of h1n1 flu virus resistant to human antibodies a controversial researcher who in the past had replicated the deadly @entity10 flu of 1918 has done it again , this time cooking up in his lab an especially resilient strain of the @entity15 virus			1
dr @entity2 , professor of virology at @entity18 , has reportedly tweaked the 2009 strain of pandemic influenza responsible for some 500,000 deaths worldwide to make it resistant to the human immune system 's antibodies			1
@entity26 's many critics have said that his latest provocative experiment has essentially rendered the world ’s population defenseless against the virus			1
according to the @entity31 , the @entity15 virus that sparked the 2009 - 2010 pandemic has turned into a regular human flu virus that continues to circulate seasonally worldwide			1
@entity2 's goal , as the independent has reported , was to convert the virus into its pre-pandemic state in order to see how it has changed over the past four years			1
ostensibly , his goal is to perfect the design of the flu vaccines of the future , but in order to achieve it , the scientist has enabled the virus to ‘ escape ’ the human immune system			2
‘ through selection of immune escape viruses in the laboratory under appropriate containment conditions , we were able to identify the key regions [ that ] would enable 2009 @entity15 viruses to escape immunity , ’ professor @entity2 told the paper			2
the trailblazing virologist , who has been conducting his risky experiments out of a state - of - the - art laboratory at the @entity79 in @entity80 , lifted the lid on the @entity15 study earlier this year during a closed - door scientific meeting , where members of the audience walked away shocked			0
an unnamed scientist who saw @entity2 ’s presentation explained that his colleague had picked out @entity15 strains that were resistant to antibodies and then repeated the process several time until he had on his hands a super-virus that could not be wiped out by a vaccine			1
‘ he used a flu virus that is known to infect humans and then manipulated it in such a way that it would effectively leave the global population defenseless if it ever escaped from his laboratory , ’ the unnamed scientist told the publication			1
he added : ‘ everything he did before was dangerous but this is even madder			0
’ epicenter : @entity2 and his team have been experimenting with deadly flue viruses in his state - of - the - art lab at the @entity18 's @entity79 officials at the @entity18 have reassured the public that there is little to no risk that the virus could escape from the lab. @entity115 , who oversees some of the research center 's most sensitive work , explained that @entity2 's project is a stress - test of sorts meant to identify @entity15 strains that could evade the human immune system in order to make the next vaccine more effective			1
‘ i have no concerns about the biosafety of these experiments , ’ she said			0
on his part , @entity2 has fervently defended his research methods and safety procedures in his lab , saying that the work is being conducted by experienced scientists under appropriate containment			2
@entity2 ’s work had been green - lighted by @entity18 ’s @entity136 , but some members of the committee reportedly had been in the dark until recently about details of the pandemic study			1
they have since expressed concerns about the research			0
another error : health officials have revealed that a bird flu breach occurred in addition to the anthrax debacle			0
a @entity31 lab sent another lab a sample that was supposed to be weak bird flu but had been contaminated with a potent strain and killed all the lab chickens exposed to it committee member @entity156 called on @entity26 to to modify the flu viruses he has been working with to make them less dangerous to humans , according to @entity160			0
but the virologist responded by saying that doing so would undermine his research			0
professor @entity2 , 58 , has emerged as a polarizing figure in the scientific community , where he has been widely denounced by infectious disease experts for his high - risk work with potentially lethal viruses			2
last month , it was reported that his team used a process called reverse genetics to analyze the 1918 flu strain that infected 500million people , of whom 50million succumbed to the disease in the years following @entity177 i. former chief science adviser to the @entity180 government lord may told @entity182 : ' the work they are doing is absolutely crazy			0
the whole thing is exceedingly dangerous			0
after critics called for his high - security research to be stopped , @entity2 defended the work , insisting it had potentially ' life - saving benefits			0

dr @entity2 , 58 , had chosen strains of 2009 pandemic virus that were resistant to antibodies
the goal of the study at @entity18 's @entity198 is to *improve* vaccines
@entity2 's critics say if the virus escapes from his lab , the human population would be defenseless against it
