they are the smart glasses that let wearers see information in their peripheral vision as well as take photos in the blink of an eye			0
but while @entity12 may sound cool to tech - heads , the search giant ’s inability to offer its smart spectacles to the general public , means that the spy - movie worthy gadget is being ditched by developers			1
after two years of wearing his pair to high - profile events , even @entity18 co-founder @entity17 turned up without his pair to a @entity23 red - carpet event on sunday , saying that he had left them in his car			1
the spectacles comprise a camera , processor and stamp - sized computer screen mounted to the edge of eyeglass frames in order to show users information on the lenses			0
@entity12 may have some specialised uses in the workplace but its prospects of becoming a consumer hit in the near future are slim according to many developers and @entity18 has pushed back the roll out to the mass market			1
of 16 @entity12 app makers contacted by @entity58 , nine said that they had stopped work on their projects or abandoned them , mostly because of the lack of customers or limitations of the device			1
three more have switched to developing for business , leaving behind consumer projects			0
plenty of larger developers remain with @entity12			2
among the 100 apps available are @entity72 , but @entity73 recently defected			2
of 16 @entity12 app makers contacted by @entity58 , nine said that they had stopped work on their projects or abandoned them , mostly because of the lack of customers or limitations of the device			1
this is despite @entity18 trying to make its smart specs more fashionable			1
frames designed by @entity82 are shown in april , @entity18 launched the @entity84 program to help make the device useful for specific industries , such as healthcare and manufacturing			1
so far the effort has resulted in apps that are being tested or used at companies such as @entity92 and food chain @entity93			0
@entity18 is selling @entity12 in bulk to some businesses , offering two - for - one discounts			2
@entity97 , which uses @entity12 as portable computers for surgeons and other people out of offices , is currently in use at 19 @entity104 hospitals and expects that to grow to 100 hospitals early next year , said chief executive @entity106			2
@entity113 began see through , a @entity12 advertising analytics firm for business , after a venture firm earlier this year withdrew its offer to back his consumer - oriented glass fitness company when it became clear no big consumer glass release was imminent			2
‘ it was devastating , ’ he said			0
‘ all of the consumer glass start - ups are either completely dead or have pivoted , ’ to enterprise products or rival wearables			0
‘ if there was 200 million @entity12 sold , it would be a different perspective			2
' there 's no market at this point , ’ said @entity124 , the chief executive of @entity126 , which put development of a @entity12 game on hold this year and is looking at other platforms , including the @entity72 - owned virtual - reality goggles @entity133			1
several key @entity18 employees instrumental to developing @entity12 have left the company in the last six months , including lead developer @entity136			2
@entity18 insists it is committed to @entity12 , with hundreds of engineers and executives working on it , as well as new fashion - focused boss @entity140 , a former @entity142 executive			1
tens of thousands use @entity12 in the pilot consumer program			2
‘ we are completely energised and as energised as ever about the opportunity that wearables and @entity12 in particular represent , ’ said @entity146 of business operations @entity147			0
@entity12 was the first project to emerge from @entity18 's x division , which is also creating self - driving cars			1
it ’s thought that it will take time for such ground - breaking technologies , including wearables such as smartwatches and @entity12 to evolve into a products that click with consumers			2
‘ if there was 200 million @entity12 sold , it would be a different perspective			0
there 's no market at this point , ’ said @entity124 , the chief executive of @entity126 , which is looking at developing games for other platforms , including the @entity72 - owned virtual - reality goggles @entity133 ( headset pictured ) mobile game company @entity170 was one of the first to launch a game on @entity12			1
while @entity174 ( pictured ) , a puzzler released a year ago , is still available , @entity170 has discontinued work on it , a spokesman for the company said , perhaps due to limited customers using @entity12 ‘ we are as committed as ever to a consumer launch			1
that is going to take time and we are not going to launch this product until it 's absolutely ready , ’ mr @entity147 said			1
mr @entity17 had predicted a launch this year , but 2015 is now the most likely date , a person familiar with the matter said			0
after an initial burst of enthusiasm , signs that consumers are giving up on @entity12 have been building			0
@entity18 dubbed the first set of several thousand @entity12 users as ‘ explorers , ’ but as these people hit the streets , they drew stares and jokes			1
some people viewed the device , capable of surreptitious video recording , as an obnoxious privacy intrusion , deriding the once - proud explorers as ‘ @entity204			1
’ ‘ it looks super nerdy , ’ said @entity205 , a @entity206 - based consultant , whose @entity12 now gathers dust in a drawer			2
‘ i 'm a card carrying nerd , but this was one card too many			0
’ @entity12 now sells on @entity213 for as little as half list price , while some developers have claimed they felt unsupported by investors and even @entity18 itself			1
@entity12 was the first project to emerge from @entity18 's x division , which is also creating self - driving cars ( pictured )			1
it ’s thought that it will take time for such ground - breaking technologies , including wearables such as smartwatches and @entity12 to evolve into a products that click with consumers the lack of a launch date has given some developers the impression that @entity18 still treats @entity12 as an experiment			1
@entity231 , founder of @entity233 - based software firm @entity232 , which put a @entity12 app for logging exercise and biking on hold , said : ‘ it 's not a big enough platform to play on seriously			1
mobile game company @entity170 , known for its popular ‘ @entity239 : @entity241 ’ title , was one of the first to launch a game on @entity12			0
while @entity174 , a puzzler released a year ago , is still available , @entity170 has discontinued work on it , a spokesman for the company said			0
but there are still some enthusiastic developers			0
cycling and running app @entity251 finds @entity12 well - suited for its users , who want real - time data on their workouts , said @entity257 , vice president of business development			2
and entrepreneur @entity258 said it is ideal for his company , @entity260 , which detects if people are falling asleep at the wheel			0
this graphic reveals how @entity18 's prototype driverless car looks and works			1
the car makes turns and reacts to vehicles and pedestrians based on computer programs that predict what others might do , and data from sensors including radar and cameras that read , in real - time , what other objects are actually doing the prototype two - seater cars have buttons to autonomously begin and end the drive			0
the car makes turns and reacts to vehicles and pedestrians based on computer programs that predict what others might do , and data from sensors including radar and cameras that read , in real - time , what other objects are actually doing			0
the route might be set by typing a destination into a map or using spoken commands according to @entity293 , the leader of @entity18 's self - driving car team			1
the car will be powered by electricity and could go about 100miles ( 160km ) before charging			0
its shape suggests a rounded - out @entity299 - something that might move people around a corporate campus or congested downtown - with headlights and sensors arrayed to resemble a friendly face			0
the front of the vehicle has a soft foam - like material where a traditional bumper would be and a more flexible windscreen , in a bid to be safer for pedestrians			0
in these prototypes speed is restricted to 25mph ( 40kph ) and the ability to self - drive will depend on specifically designed @entity18 road maps tested on the company ’s current fleet of vehicles			0
ultimately the vehicles will be faster and will be able to use @entity18 's extended maps service			1
driving works by using gps technology to locate the vehicle ’s exact position on an electronic map			0
a combination of radar , lasers and cameras sitting on top of the roof give the car a 360 - degree ‘ view ’ , with sensors linked to computer software able to ‘ see ’ and identify people , cars , road signs and markings and traffic lights .			0

delay in releasing @entity12 to public means developers are ditching device
@entity18 co-founder @entity17 was spotted without his pair recently
of 16 @entity12 app makers , nine said that they had stopped work on their projects or abandoned them because of a lack of customers
some developers are focusing on making apps for @entity133 instead
@entity18 says it 's committed to its $ 1,500 specs and it 's taking time to get them ' absolutely ready ' before launching them to the general public
despite fashionable frames , some people say they look too nerdy and early *adopters* have been branded ' @entity204 ' because of privacy fears
