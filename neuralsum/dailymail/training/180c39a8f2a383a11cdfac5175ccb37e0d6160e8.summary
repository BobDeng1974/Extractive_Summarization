she escaped by breaking free of her makeshift ties , hiding in a bramble bush and running through fields naked for around an hour until she found a house which was occupied by an elderly couple who called 999			1
remarkably she suffered only cuts and bruises in the attack , although she has been left anxious and ' on red alert '			2
speaking publically for the first time since the incident in december 2013 , miss @entity7 , now living at an undisclosed location in @entity43 , said she had spent the day with @entity8 , but he had become upset when she said she wanted to spend the night alone			1
he kept calling her so she turned her phone to silent mode and settled into bed for the night			2
miss @entity7 said : ' i was just nodding off when i heard a crashing noise			1
' it sounded like the front door being kicked in			2
then i heard @entity8 , shouting			1
' he said , " where is she , the liar ? " ' i got up and found @entity8 wielding a metal bar			1
he had smashed the tv			2
he said , " come with me "			0
then my mum appeared , and my kids came out of their room			0
' miss @entity7 said she was disappointed by the sentence @entity8 received , believing that he would have been jailed for longer than 20 months at this point @entity8 pulled @entity22 towards the front door			1
in a desperate bid to appease him she offered to run away with him			0
' i had to calm him down , ' she explained			0
' i hoped all the commotion would wake a neighbour who 'd call the police			0
but i did n't hear any sirens			0
' as i was leaving i told my kids it would be all right			0
' @entity8 drove @entity22 for ' what seemed like hours ' to ' a wooded track that led to a deserted quarry			1
' ' he demanded i take my trousers off , ' miss @entity7 – who was wearing pyjamas – said			1
' he then led me to a tree , wrapped my arms around it , and tied them up with my pyjama bottoms			1
' he said , " that 's what happens to whores , " and then forced me to strip completely			2
' after a time he drove off and she made her escape , hiding in a ditch when she heard his car			2
' i was terrified , ' she said			0
' i could only see horses ' fields			0
' there were no lights on or houses			0
' i ran for my life			0
' i must have been running for an hour , when i spotted a house			2
' the police were called and she was taken to hospital			0
@entity8 went on the run and was arrested four weeks later			1
but the attack had a longer lasting impact on @entity22			1
' before , i 'd had lots of friends and enjoyed going out on the town , ' she said			0
' after i did n't know who to trust and was scared to even pop out for a bottle of milk			0
' i only left the house at certain times of the day when i thought town would be quiet and i was on the red alert when i did			1
' i suffered anxiety attacks and had nightmares			0
' in july last year @entity8 , of @entity113 , @entity17 , appeared at @entity114 where he pleaded guilty to kidnap			1
ms @entity7 said that she was taken to hospital for treatment but it took police four weeks to track @entity8 down @entity119 of @entity22 said they had heard @entity8 say : ' you can run @entity7 , but you wo n't get far			1
' her eldest son was heard to say : ' he 's going to kill my mum			0
' in august , he was sentenced to 20 months in prison for kidnap , and received a five - year restraining order			1
miss @entity7 said : ' i 'd hoped he 'd get longer			1
' she urged other women to be alert to potential warnings of domestic abuse			0
' my parents had been shocked that @entity8 was capable of hurting me , ' she said			2
i guess on the surface our relationship looked like it was going well			0
but before the attack he always wanted to know what i 'd been up to , was accusing me of cheating			2
now i want to encourage other women to leave bad relationships			0
' walk out on physically violent , emotionally and mentally abusive partners			0

please , get out , before things turn ugly			0
