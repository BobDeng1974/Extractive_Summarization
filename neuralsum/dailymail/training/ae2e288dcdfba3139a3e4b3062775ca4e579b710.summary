on july 13 , @entity0 lifted the @entity1			1
after coming off the bench in the 31st minute , the winger played a crucial part in @entity5 eventually triumphing over @entity6 – setting @entity7 up with a pinpoint cross to turn home the extra-time winner			2
it was a fitting end to his tournament , which cast him as @entity14 ’s secret weapon			0
he netted the crucial extra-time opener against @entity17 in the second round before rubbing salt in @entity21 ’s semi-final wound by scoring the final two in @entity5 ’s famous 7 - 1 win			1
when he returned to show off his new medal to his @entity27 team - mates , fans could be forgiven for thinking they were about to be treated to settled - in @entity0 adding lightning pace and finishing to the @entity30 attack			1
@entity0 ( centre ) battles for the ball with @entity35 's @entity34 ( left ) @entity0 falls to the ground after being challenged by @entity37 during tuesday night 's match @entity39 ( second left ) celebrates @entity27 's winner at @entity35 with @entity0 what they ’ve got instead is @entity43 slamming him after a poor display at @entity45			1
@entity0 was continually wasteful both in possession and with his frequent long - range shots , with the @entity27 manager admitting his disappointment			1
it ’s not the first time this season			0
handed chances to impress against @entity54 in the @entity55 and @entity56 in the @entity57 , @entity0 turned in similarly frustrating displays			1
too often he was trying to make the impossible happen rather than using his undoubted quality to influence the game			0
instead of @entity27 ’s attacking play going through him , he scuppered many of the @entity30 ' moves forward			2
the contrast to @entity66 ’s tireless teamwork and ability to play in his fellow attackers makes it easy to see why the @entity21 is preferred in big games			2
@entity27 manager @entity43 issues instructions during the match against @entity73 on sunday @entity0 lifts the @entity1 trophy after @entity5 beat @entity6 1 - 0 in the 2014 final in @entity21 in july @entity0 ( right ) controls the ball during the @entity1 final as he is chased by @entity6 's @entity78 @entity0 has his shades on as he is pictured with the @entity1 at the parade through @entity81 in july in the days following the game in @entity83 , @entity43 commented on @entity0 : ' sometimes phenomenal , sometimes he is so - so			1
when he is phenomenal , he is phenomenal			0
' @entity43 is n’t a fan of inconsistency , and his frustration after the @entity35 outing will have been at the @entity89 ’s inability to react to comments like that – no doubt relayed in far more detail behind closed doors			1
this season has also seen the ‘ phenomenal ’ @entity0 – the @entity1 @entity0 – in fits and starts			2
he looked to have come on to hand @entity27 a vital three points at @entity99 before @entity100 famously returned to haunt his old club			0
he is currently playing himself into being an impact player – a roll of the dice for 20 minutes when things are n’t going right			0
@entity0 celebrates after scoring against @entity99 in the @entity107 clash last month @entity0 celebrates towards the @entity27 fans at the @entity109 after scoring against @entity99 many a player has made a career out of being a supersub , but it ca n’t have been the @entity27 niche the 23 - year - old had in mind when arriving at the club in the summer of 2013			2
unless @entity0 adjusts his mentality when called upon to be a crucial part of the @entity30 ’ attack , the manager will lose patience altogether			0
last season saw @entity43 cast off a fans ’ favourite in @entity125 because of a perceived inability to follow direction			0
schurrle must shape up if he does n’t want to go the same way .			0

@entity0 won the @entity1 with @entity5 at @entity21 2014
@entity43 *criticised* @entity0 for his poor display at @entity35
the @entity27 *midfielder* must shape up after turning in frustrating displays
