now experts have revealed that the freak weather conditions , which left parts of the country under a smoggy haze earlier this month , also triggered a record surge in demand for hay fever treatments			1
pharmacists saw demand for products including antihistamine tablets , nose sprays and eye drops , increase by 84 per cent in the first week of april when compared to the same week in 2013			2
sales of hay fever treatments soared in the first week of april while parts of the @entity27 were blanketed in smog and @entity6 dust			1

people with asthma , hay fever and breathing problems particularly suffered in the smoggy conditions , according to aeroallergen and agricultural air quality researcher at the @entity44 , dr @entity45			1
he said : ‘ it 's common to have the air pollution and pollen at this time of year but it 's very unusual to have the cocktail with the dust as well			0
’ as a result , he believed many hay fever sufferers experienced more severe symptoms than usual – which will come as no surprise to millions of people who have been sneezing and sniffing as the hay fever season gets under way			2
according to advice issued by the charity @entity62 , the smog also coincided with the birch pollen season to provide the perfect storm for hay fever sufferers			2
the charity said : ‘ the weather patterns resulted in high pollution together with dust from the @entity6			0

‘ this combination may have an impact on those with asthma , hay fever and other respiratory problems			1
’ when the smog cloud hit @entity27 , the worst affected areas for pollution levels were in the capital and @entity91 , both given the maximum level of 10 , according to the @entity94 ( @entity94 )			0
these regions also saw the highest demand for hay fever treatments from @entity98 over the same period , with sales rising by 25 per cent in @entity32 , and 12 per cent in the @entity91 of @entity100			1
experts believe people with hay fever , asthma and other breathing problems suffered the most while the air quality was poor the elevated pollution levels were the result of a combination of light south - easterly winds , continental air flow , a mix of traffic and power station emissions and dust which was blown up from the @entity6 desert			1
in effect this created a ‘ lid ’ on the air at ground level so pollens were released and were unable to escape into the upper atmosphere			0
instead , they were concentrated at lower levels where they cause the most problems for hay fever sufferers			2
the @entity129 hit the top level of 10 on april 1 in parts of @entity132 and the @entity91			0

@entity140 , @entity98 superintendent pharmacist , said many people with pre-existing health conditions such as asthma and hay fever found that their symptoms were aggravated by the recent weather conditions			1
‘ hay fever sufferers usually need to pre-empt when their symptoms begin and start taking medication as early as possible , but this year many people were caught by surprise as they were affected earlier than usual , ’ he said			1
as well as managing symptoms through tablets and sprays for the eyes and nose , mr @entity140 also recommends sufferers take part in regular exercise and improve their diet with more fruit and vegetables			0
