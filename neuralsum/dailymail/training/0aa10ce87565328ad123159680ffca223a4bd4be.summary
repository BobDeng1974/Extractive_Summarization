if stacking the dishwasher is a chore you dread , help may soon be at hand			0
@entity6 scientists have developed a robot which they are training to complete that very task			2
the robot - which they have named @entity11 - is the first to have enough intelligence to work out how to grip any single item put in front of it			1
it can work out how to pick up different objects placed in front of it			1
called ' @entity11 ' ( shown ) it is controlled by three separate computers while that is sufficient for most factory production , creating a robot which can pick up and manipulate any single item hugely increases its potential use for industry , surgery , or in the home			1
the development marks a huge step forward in robotics			0
until now robots could only pick up items of a fixed size , placed in a fixed location			2
@entity11 - who was publicly unveiled at the @entity42 in @entity43 today - is controlled by three different computers and has cost £ 350,000 ( $ 570,000 ) to build			1
professor @entity45 , the @entity18 computing expert who led the project , said loading a dishwasher was his main goal			1
‘ the scenario that we 've got is to get the robot to load a dishwasher , ’ he said			2
‘ that 's not because i think that dishwasher - loading robots are an economic , social necessity right now			0
it 's because it encapsulates an incredibly hard range of general manipulation tasks			0
‘ once you can crack that , once you can manipulate an object that you 've never seen before , you can do a whole bunch of different things			0
‘ loading a dishwasher is a really hard task			0
’ the @entity11 robot has been created by @entity6 scientists @entity11 has thick multi-jointed arms that enable it to pick up objects			1
the robot can learn various grips and costs £ 350,000 ( $ 570,000 ) to build @entity11 the robot 's hands can learn the dexterity needed to pick up objects of different shapes and sizes @entity11 performed in public for the first time in front of a festival audience yesterday			1
safely confined to a basement laboratory , he reached out with a thick multi-jointed aluminium arm and picked up a measuring jug followed by a dustpan before depositing them in a tray			1
significantly , @entity11 has been programmed to figure out different ways to handle each object , by curling round his fingers to use the whole hand , using the palm of the hand in a power - grip , or adopting a more delicate pinch - grip to grasp an edge			1
@entity11 is able to learn the different grips and adapt them to other unfamiliar objects without breaking or dropping them			1
‘ you 've got all the freedom of having all these fingers , so now your brain has got to work really hard , ’ said prof @entity45			0
‘ the robot comes up with about 1,000 different grasps in its head in about 10 seconds			0

but when those objects vary in size or shape , robots tend to get clumsy			0
‘ the system we have developed allows the robot to assess the object and generate hundreds of different grasp options			0
that means the robot is able to make choices about the best grasp for the object it has been told to pick up , and it does n't have to be re-trained each time the object changes			2
’ this could have major applications in industry			0
the project , called @entity143 , has been carried out in collaboration with the universities of @entity146 in @entity147 and @entity148 in @entity149 , and is funded by the @entity150			2
the team has already patented the technology , and is working with a firm in @entity154 to develop a version of @entity11 that co-operates with humans on the factory floor			2
@entity11 is able to learn the different grips and adapt them to other unfamiliar objects without breaking them professor @entity45 , the @entity18 computing expert who led the project , said loading a dishwasher was his main goal ‘ it might be five or 10 years in the future , but you 're going to have robots working with humans , and that means they 're going to have to cope with all the uncertainty that humans introduce into the environment , ’ he said			1
‘ one of the really big problems on robot assembly lines is if you want to change the part shapes			0
at the moment , when the world changes , the whole system breaks down			0
you want to be able to change the parts on short runs very , very quickly			0
’ a lot more work is needed before a new generation of @entity11 robots is sent into the real world			1
the next big step for the scientists is to get @entity11 to use both his arms and transfer objects from one hand to another			1
‘ being bi-manual is a real advantage for all sorts of purposes , ’ said @entity193 , who hopes to see the robot stacking plates by next april .			2
