it was the @entity1 against the @entity2			0
a striker currently spearheading the favourites to win @entity6 ’s elite club tournament against a central defence drawn from @entity9 ’s second tier			0
their respective profiles and earning power would suggest only one winner			0
but there are still some things that @entity17 ’s reputed £ 150,000 - a - week salary at @entity18 ca n’t buy			1
a goal against @entity20 is one of them			1
@entity22 and @entity23 , of @entity24 and @entity25 respectively , looked this superstar striker in the eye and vowed they would not let him score			1
@entity29 's @entity17 ( left ) reacts after a challenge by @entity20 's @entity23 @entity20 's @entity22 ( right ) is put under pressure by @entity29 star @entity17 they were as good as that intention demanded			1
yet keeping @entity17 under wraps came at a price elsewhere			1
the thumping equaliser netted by @entity37 was a painful blow given how well @entity20 had done to recover from losing a sloppy opening goal			1
perhaps , though , any sense of disappointment at only drawing away to a team who had just sunk the world champions is a sign of how far @entity47 ’s side have come			0
this could yet prove to be a vital point on the long and winding road towards @entity51			0
@entity17 had set up the clinching second goal in @entity29 ’s historic win over @entity54 on saturday , but was mainly reduced to a frustrated figure as tuesday night ’s match unfolded			1
time and again , @entity22 and @entity23 denied him space or forced him out of the danger zone			1
only once did he manage to unleash his formidable power on @entity62 ’s goal			0
it was met with a superb flying save from the @entity66 goalkeeper			0
yes , @entity20 lack a global name to compare with @entity17 but this was further evidence of how far a genuine team unit might take us			1
@entity17 ( bottom ) stretches for the ball as @entity23 keeps close to the @entity29 frontman @entity22 ( left ) and @entity20 captain @entity75 applaud the fans after claiming a point in @entity78 what a stage this was for @entity23 to make his competitive debut for @entity20 after four friendly outings			1
two months short of his 34th birthday , only @entity84 great @entity83 has entered international football at such an advanced age			2
having precious qualification points at stake may have been a new experience for @entity23 but , oddly enough , playing in this stadium was n’t			1
he was part of the team that recorded a 1 - 0 friendly win here in march			0
alongside him stood @entity22 , who has become one of the first names on @entity47 ’s team - sheet in recent months			1
like @entity23 , the door to his progression was opened by injuries to colleagues			1
a starring role in the remarkable 1 - 0 win over @entity105 in june of last year confirmed his capability to be an effective international performer			0
neither was overawed by what they encountered in the @entity110 , a ground which is one of the most impressive in @entity114 football			0
constructed for the @entity117 finals , four giant television screens hang from a central column its retractable roof			0
they featured the face of former @entity123 defender @entity122 in the countdown to kick off			0
now with @entity126 , the full - back warned his adopted homeland not to expect old - fashioned route - one football from @entity47 ’s side			0
one thing the locals do not need a lesson in is how to sing a national anthem			0
the ground reverberated to the noise of @entity136 as plastic banners turned the stands into one giant @entity29 flag			2
@entity17 has his eye on the ball during the @entity144 qualifier between @entity29 and @entity20 the @entity145 celebrate in @entity78 after @entity147 's goal puts @entity20 2 - 1 ahead the euphoria that filled this place after a first - ever victory over @entity54 was still lingering some 72 hours on			1
dampening that rampant positivity and injecting some doubt had to be the early aim			0
instead @entity154 arrived with a gift for @entity156 to fire @entity29 into an 11th minute lead via @entity62 ’s left - hand post			1
it was a sign of @entity20 ’s confidence , however , that the recovery was both prompt and effective			2
seven minutes was all it took for a fine move to end with @entity164 placing the ball beyond @entity166			0
around the first half flurries , the battle to contain @entity17 was unfolding			2
@entity22 won the first direct duel with a thumping challenge near the touchline that rebounded off the @entity172 to bring a @entity20 throw			1
it set the tone for the opening period as @entity47 ’s defence worked tirelessly to deny the 26 - year - old space			0
@entity23 tested his fortitude with a crunching block on an attempted shot from 25 yards out			2
@entity17 writhed in the ground in pain and continued chirping in the direction of @entity186 referee @entity185			2
if @entity23 ’s intention was lay down a marker , to remind his illustrious opponent that he would not be cowed by reputation , then it seemed to have the desired effect			2
to help @entity22 and @entity23 in their quest , @entity47 had opted to drop @entity195 in favour of the superior physique provided by @entity198			1
there was no doubt the @entity201 were a powerful side and @entity198 ’s selection was justified by one moment late in the first half			0
@entity20 players celebrate after @entity147 ( third left ) gave the visitors a 2 - 1 lead against @entity29 @entity209 ( left ) and @entity20 manager @entity47 leave the field after claiming a point it looked for all the vodka in @entity78 that @entity17 would score after @entity214 got in behind @entity154 and delivered a ball that eliminated the centre - backs			1
@entity198 , though , stole in from the striker ’s blind side with a terrific covering challenge that rescued the situation			0
@entity23 had been keeping things simple and steady in most of his work but allowed one pass to carelessly bobble him			2
@entity17 was onto it in a flash but , just as he turned to home in on goal , he found @entity22 blocking his path			1
no - one could complain about the communication between the @entity2 pairing over the first 45 minutes			0
there were times in the second period when it was more fraught , despite @entity147 putting @entity20 in front			2
the @entity18 man was an inch or two away on getting his toe on the end a cross from the excellent @entity37 , before @entity62 was finally required to deny him in impressive style			0
@entity17 will now return to @entity241 with the club game ’s greatest prizes in his sights			2
the aims of @entity22 and @entity23 are more modest , but on tuesday night they were all equals .			1

@entity17 failed to score in @entity29 's 2 - 2 draw with @entity20
@entity22 and @entity23 were impressive for the visitors
@entity23 was making his competitive debut for @entity20 at the age of *33*
