a @entity2 who was interviewed by @entity4 to work in its media centre has revealed just how slick and well - funded its pr machine is the man , who turned the job down , told the @entity29 : ' they offered me $ 1,500 a month [ five times the average @entity2 salary ] , plus a car , a house and all the cameras i needed			1
i remembered looking around the office			0
it was amazing the equipment they had in there			2
' the @entity40 is becoming increasingly focussed on finding out precisely where the group 's money is coming from			2
@entity44 and other leaders will discuss the issue at next week 's annual @entity47			0
and a new @entity40 - based research group called the @entity49 is poised to release to governments and media outlets a database of information about militants and their supporters			1
it 's convinced that @entity4 is generating a great deal of wealth – it ’s thought to have stockpiled around £ 1billion - from shady deals with morally compromised companies			1
risk management group @entity61 believes that @entity4 controls half a dozen oil fields in @entity2 and four in @entity64 , with many officials convinced it 's making millions from smuggling barrels to @entity67 , @entity68 and @entity64			1
the group is also known to make money from kidnappings , extortion and robbery			0

these strikes have already begun in @entity64 , and been authorized to begin in @entity2 by @entity44			1
in addition , the @entity83 approved a bill to train and arm moderate @entity2 rebels to battle @entity88 militants			1
meanwhile , a description of @entity91 by @entity4 as an ‘ uncircumcised old geezer ’ is further evidence of @entity95 involvement in the militant organisation , a terrorism expert has said			2
connection : the use of the word ' geezer ' in the translation of @entity103 's description of @entity91 is yet more evidence of strong ties between @entity95 and @entity4 , according to an expert low blow : the group called @entity91 an ' uncircumcised old geezer ' after his comments that the terrorist organization ' did not represent @entity112 ' in front of the @entity114 the comment about the @entity40 secretary of state came in an audio recording by @entity4 spokesman @entity118			1
he said : ' the uncircumcised old geezer , suddenly became an @entity112 jurist , issuing a verdict to the people that the @entity88 was distorting @entity112 , that what it was doing was against @entity112 teachings , and that the @entity88 was an enemy of @entity112			0
' professor @entity126 , head of the centre for security and intelligence studies at the @entity130 , said the use of @entity95 slang was hugely significant			0
he told @entity1 : ‘ i 'd say the use of the word " geezer " is a massively important further giveaway about the identity of some of these @entity4 thugs			2
it 's a term most usually heard in @entity141			0
' so @entity4 have drawn us , i 'd suspect intentionally , back towards reflecting on the fact that brits are fighting for these sadistic butchers , taunting not just the families of the hostages but our government and our position in the world			2
' @entity95 's link to @entity88 became known around the world after shocking videos showed a @entity95 man known as ' @entity156 ' executing @entity40 journalists @entity157 , 40 , and @entity159 , 31 , as well as @entity95 aid worker @entity160 , 44			0
some sources believe that @entity156 comes from a @entity141 suburb about 10 miles from @entity163			0
professor @entity126 added : ' it 's my understanding that @entity166 and the counter-terrorism police do know the identity of " @entity156 " but that like the @entity95 government more generally they do n't see any advantage at this stage in telling the rest of us , not so much out of consideration to " @entity156 's " family but to the hostages because this is about the lives of innocent hostages here , and every move that we take needs to be very carefully considered before we take it			0
