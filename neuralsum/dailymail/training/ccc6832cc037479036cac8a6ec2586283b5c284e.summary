by @entity0 published : 18:45 est , 2 december 2013 updated : 19:04 est , 2 december 2013 director general @entity1 is alleged to have intervened in the programme 's broadcast the @entity4 is to finally screen an investigation into claims that millions of pounds donated to @entity7 were invested in tobacco and arms firms instead of going straight to charity			1
the corporation said it would broadcast the @entity13 documentary in the coming weeks after it was reportedly twice shelved by bosses			1
the probe , which says £ 150million was invested for eight years before being handed to good causes , is potentially embarrassing for the @entity4 , which has close ties to @entity7			1
it is thought it can only be shown now after bosses reviewed the footage			2
the programme was initially cancelled by executives in the run - up to @entity23 in november , drawing parallels with the decision not to screen a @entity27 exposé on allegations of sexual abuse by @entity30			2
critics said the @entity7 probe had been shelved because the revelations would have damaged its fundraising potential but the @entity4 insisted it simply needed more time so it could meet its ‘ robust editorial standards ’			1
@entity4 director general @entity1 and director of news @entity37 are said to have intervened personally to ensure the documentary was rescheduled			1
at the @entity41 autumn conference last week , @entity1 said : ‘ it ’s @entity37 ’s programme			2
he wants to get it right			0
' it ’s quite right the director of news has views about programmes			0
’ viewers who donated to @entity7 will be shocked their money was for years invested rather than going straight to impoverished people around the world			2
the @entity13 probe looks at how £ 150million donated by the public to @entity7 was invested for eight years before being passed on to charities			1
included in this was £ 14million put into the @entity58 , which invests in three of the world ’s biggest cigarette firms and arms giant @entity59			0
the six - month investigation for @entity13 by independent tv company @entity64 also suggests @entity7 has been sitting on £ 261million in shares , bonds and cash and owed £ 126million			0
staff costs have doubled at the charity from £ 7.1million a year in 2008 to £ 13.5million by 2012			0
last year , however , it raised £ 87.8million - less than in two of the three previous years			0
the @entity4 has had long ties with @entity7 which has been broadcast by the corporation for over 25 years it has also emerged that the charity , which is backed by many celebrities , made a huge loss of £ 800,000 on a failed venture selling @entity79 - branded sauces			1
after the @entity13 programme was initially shelved , mr @entity37 is thought to have asked producers to provide more compelling evidence from their investigation before ensuring it was rescheduled			1
ahead of it being aired , executives have now allegedly reviewed the programme , which looks at several charities and how they invest funds			0
the bosses stepped in after senior executives supposedly excused themselves from ruling on whether the programme could run			1
the @entity4 has extremely close ties with @entity7 dating back almost 30 years			2
the scandal has been likened to the decision not to broadcast a programme on @entity30 the @entity98 and @entity99 telethons are broadcast on the @entity4 and @entity100 , the director of @entity101 , and directors @entity102 and @entity104 are @entity7 trustees			1
a @entity4 spokeswoman confirmed the @entity13 special would be broadcast			1
it is expected to air on tuesday december 10			0
she added : ‘ @entity110 and @entity111 acts entirely independently of the wider @entity4 in commissioning and preparing programmes			2
' it is simply wrong to suggest that the timing of the proposed @entity13 investigation into the charity sector has in any way been influenced by the timing of @entity23			0
‘ the planned broadcast date of this investigation was delayed until we were satisfied that the programme met our robust editorial standards and we hope to schedule the programme to air in the near future			1
’ a spokeswoman for @entity7 said allegations about its investment strategy were ‘ inaccurate , misleading and show a total lack of understanding of the actual position ’			0
‘ @entity7 takes the business of making grants and managing the money so generously donated by the public extremely seriously			0
‘ we ’re satisfied that our approach is wholly appropriate and meets all regulatory and legal requirements			0
we have nothing to hide and publish a full explanation on our website			0
