@entity0 is planning to ramp up security on its @entity3 service to keep hackers out of user accounts			1
chief executive @entity6 made the announcements in the face of the recent celebrity photo scandal that saw hundreds of images stolen from the online service			1
mr @entity6 told the @entity12 @entity0 will aggressively encourage users to take stricter security measures , and the firm will alert users if someone tries to access their files			1
chief executive @entity6 ( pictured ) said the firm will now send alerts to users each time someone tries to access and make changes to an @entity3 account these alerts will be sent using email and push notifications each time someone tries to change an account password , restore @entity3 data to a new device , or when a device logs into an account for the first time			1
it is possible for users to enhance the security of their documents by turning off @entity43 on their device when they are not using it			2
they can also turn on two - step verification for their @entity3 account			2
the tool prevents people accessing accounts - even if they have the password			0
to set up two - step verification , go to my @entity0 @entity53			0
select manage your @entity0 id and sign in , then select @entity57			0
under two - step verification , select get started and follow the onscreen instructions			0
when a user sets up two - step verification , they register one or more trusted devices			0
a trusted device is one that can receive 4 - digit verification codes using either @entity66 or @entity67			0
once enabled , any time a user signs in to manage their @entity53 at my @entity53 , or make an @entity74 , @entity75 , or @entity73 purchase from a new device , they 'll need to verify their identity by entering both their password and a 4 - digit verification code			2
@entity0 is said to be moving quickly to restore confidence in its systems ' security ahead of the crucial launch of its new @entity85 next week			1
' when i step back from this terrible scenario that happened and say what more could we have done , i think about the awareness piece , ' mr @entity6 said			1
' i think we have a responsibility to ratchet that up			0
that 's not really an engineering thing			0
' @entity6 added that @entity0 will also broaden its use of the two - factor authentication security system to avoid future intrusions			1
two - factor authentication requires a user to have two of three things to access an account			0
this can include a password , a separate four - digit one - time code , or a long access key given to the user when they signed up for the service			2
' the usability battle will always be there but could you ever imagine using your debit card at an atm and not entering a pin ? that 's two factor , something you have - a card - and something you know - a pin - and we all get along just fine , ' @entity120 's @entity119 told @entity124			0
following the attack , @entity125 spotted code on software development site @entity129 called @entity130 , that would have allowed malicious users to use ‘ brute force ’ to gain an account ’s password on @entity3 , and in particular its find my @entity85 service			1
however , after an investigation , @entity0 said on tuesday the attacks on celebrities ' @entity3 accounts were individually targeted , and that none of the cases it investigated had resulted from a breach of its systems			1
it is now working with law enforcement to identify the hackers			0
the announcement comes in the face of the recent celebrity photo scandal that saw hundreds of images stolen from @entity0 's @entity152 ( pictured )			1
@entity6 said @entity0 will also broaden its use of the two - factor authentication security system to avoid future intrusions @entity156 ( pictured ) was among the 101 celebrities who had their photos stolen from @entity3			1
she is said to have posted more than 60 nude selfies to the online service ' we want to do everything we can do to protect our customers , because we are as outraged if not more so than they are , ' continued mr. @entity6			2
the @entity3 service lets users store photos and other content , and access it from any @entity0 device			1
scammers have been taking advantage of the celebrity hacking scandal to trick people into entering their @entity0 id and password details into a fake login screen			1
security experts recently discovered emails and text messages that claim to be from @entity0 , warning users about unauthorised access to their accounts			1
the latest threat to people 's accounts comes as both the @entity187 and @entity0 have said they are investigating the link			2
the so - called phishing emails are designed to trick people into offering up their details			0
@entity3 secures data by encrypting it when it is sent over the web , storing it in an encrypted format when kept on server , and using secure tokens for authentication ( explained above )			2
this suggests the hackers were able to obtain the login credentials of the accounts , and pretend to be the user , in order to bypass this encryption @entity0 is said to be moving quickly to restore confidence in itssystems ' security ahead of the crucial launch of its new @entity85 next week			1
