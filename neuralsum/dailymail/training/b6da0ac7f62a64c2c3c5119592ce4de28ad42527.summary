by @entity0 thriving : @entity1 is now a healthy six - month - old despite doctors claiming she had died after eight months in the womb at six months old , little @entity1 is the bonniest of babies			1
but her smile belies the trauma of her entry into the world and an ordeal that no parent should ever have to face			2
when her mother @entity13 was eight months pregnant , two doctors announced that her baby had died in the womb and would be stillborn			1
the news left her ‘ simply devastated ’			1
and while carrying what she thought was a dead baby , she and her husband @entity17 then had to think about funeral arrangements			2
not only that , but at one point mr @entity21 feared his wife had died as well after he saw a crash team rush into the hospital theatre where she was giving birth			1
in fact , the team were on standby because – against the doctors ’ expectations – @entity1 had been born alive			1
despite this joyous reversal of fortune , doctors then further upset mrs @entity1 , 31 , by blaming her ‘ excess stomach weight ’ for their misdiagnosis			1
@entity37 in @entity38 has since apologised to the couple			2
the blunder occurred on a sunday and at a time when the sonographer , an expert in doing ultrasounds , was not working			1
the couple , who are both teachers and have a four - year - old daughter , @entity46 , said their nightmare began in november when mrs @entity1 was admitted to hospital with heavy bleeding at 35 weeks			1
two doctors carried out scans to check the baby			1
‘ when doctors told us our baby was n’t moving and there was no heartbeat , @entity17 and i were simply devastated , ’ said mrs @entity1			1
‘ and when nursing staff asked us to call relatives to bring a shawl to wrap up our dead baby in , and began discussing funeral plans , it was traumatic			2
‘ calling my mother , my brother and sister - in - law with that news was the worst thing we have ever had to do			1
they then had the job of telling other family and friends , including our daughter			1
’ @entity73 , 31 , had been planning the funeral when she unexpectedly went into labour			1
but she was distraught when the medics said it was her ' excess stomach fat ' that caused them to make the blunder the couple , from @entity81 , @entity38 , were then forced to wait four hours preparing for the arrival of their stillborn baby until an operating theatre became free			1
mrs @entity1 said : ‘ i still wanted to be awake when she was born , and hold her in my arms , even if she was n’t alive			2
so i opted for an epidural			0
' however , four attempts failed			0
and as i was bleeding so much i had to sign a consent form for a general anaesthetic , which meant @entity17 had to leave and wait outside			2
’ mr @entity21 recalled the moment he believed he had lost his wife			0
‘ suddenly the alarm went off and i saw a crash team rushing into the theatre , ’ he said			0
‘ in that moment my whole world imploded as i thought @entity13 had also died			2
’ i only believed it was true when i was wheeled down to special care and saw her for myself - @entity73 however , unknown to him , @entity1 had been born alive weighing 5lb 2oz and the crash team had been called in case she needed to be resuscitated			1
mr @entity21 added : ‘ about five minutes after the alarm sounded a midwife said our little girl had been born alive and well			0
‘ i will never forget the feeling of sheer relief when i realised both @entity13 and @entity1 were fine			0
i could n’t believe it when the midwife showed me to a little cot where @entity1 lay kicking her legs			0
’ mrs @entity1 said that when she came round from the anaesthetic and was told her baby had been born alive she could not take it in			0
‘ i only believed it was true when i was wheeled down to special care and saw her for myself , ’ she said			0
@entity1 spent six days in the special care unit while mrs @entity1 had several blood transfusions			0
she added : ‘ worst , while the consultant was apologetic , when we discussed what had gone wrong , he said part of the reason he was unable to see the scan clearly was due to me having excess weight on my stomach			0
special care : @entity1 , here at one day old , was born alive and well weighing 5lb 2oz , shocking doctors ‘ i was shocked as i know of women much larger than me who ’ve had normal pregnancies and been scanned efficiently			2
‘ and we believe we never would have suffered such a nightmare if a proper qualified sonographer had been on duty doing the scan			0
’ @entity1 has no side effects , but her parents claim her survival was ‘ through luck rather than judgment ’ and are considering legal action			0
a spokesman for @entity147 and @entity148 said : ‘ we apologise unreservedly for the aspects of mrs @entity1 ’s care that fell below our usual standards			0
a serious incident was raised at the time and valuable lessons have been learned			0
‘ we understand this has been a traumatic and distressing time for @entity21 and her family and we will continue to work closely with her			0

@entity73 , 31 , was 8 months pregnant when doctors delivered the news
after heavy bleeding , medics said her second daughter had died in womb
she went into labour next month , doctors blamed blunder on ' her fat '
