the @entity0 – no , not a movie , the actual promotion – will come closer to reality if @entity4 wins in @entity5 on saturday night			1
say it slowly : one			0
that is the mind - blowing value now being placed upon the boxing match the world has long been desperate to see			0
@entity4 versus @entity11 can become the single richest event in sporting history and the enormity of the prize will surely be enough to break down the barriers which have prevented it from taking place thus far			1
@entity4 fights @entity20 @entity19 in @entity5 on saturday night this bonanza is being made possible by the prospect of the first pay - per - view fight broadcast in @entity24			1
promoter @entity25 is predicting a subscription television audience in the @entity27 in excess of 100 million			0
that would generate double the $ 300million which is being projected as the @entity20 pay - tv value of the @entity32			0
yet the key to unlocking this treasure chest is not in the hands of the @entity4 or the man who calls himself @entity37			1
@entity25 is priming this enormous market by taking @entity4 to @entity5 – the @entity40 version of @entity41 - to headline promotions which also showcase @entity24 boxing hero @entity43			1
@entity4 could be set for a mega-fight with @entity11 if he comes through the fight with @entity19 @entity4 's promoter @entity25 also promotes @entity24 star @entity43 ( left ) this 33 - year - old has acquired iconic celebrity status in @entity24 by winning @entity50 gold at home in @entity52 in 2008 and retaining his title at @entity54			1
after starting his professional career with five straight wins @entity56 is closing in on a challenge for the world flyweight title , for which his saturday bout at the @entity61 is being billed as a final eliminator			0
@entity25 says : ‘ @entity43 is the driving force for taking pay - per - view into @entity24			2
they idolise him and hundreds of millions have been watching him on regular television			0
combine his appeal with @entity69 and we are looking at numbers undreamed of before			0
’ @entity25 knows he will have to modify pay - per - view charges for the @entity24 mainland			2
‘ we ’re looking at $ 5 a buy , ’ he says			0
@entity11 poses with bundles of cash ( right ) - but could be set to earn even more if he fights @entity4 cheap , compared with the near $ 100 which will be the price in @entity20			1
but multiply five dollars by one - tenth of the @entity24 population of 1.36 billion and the figures amount to a phenomenal $ 650m			1
a one per cent figure is the rule of thumb for the @entity20 ( population 319 million ) on @entity83 or @entity84 – or both sharing as they did for @entity86 vs @entity87			0
at $ 95 a buy - and a pay - tv record there in excess of three million viewers – and you exceed the $ 300m target			0
then comes the site fee from the host arena			0
@entity5 is now the @entity96 of the @entity97 , with all the major casinos on the @entity96 now operating and the high rollers from @entity24 helping push revenue above @entity102 levels			1
the @entity103 is hosting its second @entity4 fight so expect a bidding war between the two giant gaming destinations , with the @entity107 – @entity11 ’s preferred home - town venue - pitching for @entity96			1
the @entity103 in @entity24 is hosting @entity4 's fight with @entity19 and would be keen on the @entity11 fight as well - should it ever materialise @entity11 likes fighting at the @entity107 in @entity96 and they could also bid for the mega-fight tv rights for the rest of the world – including subscription sales in @entity116 – plus closed circuit cinema , the live gate and sponsorship , advertising and merchandising make up the rest of the billion dollar spectacular			1
@entity25 has been building this project since being approached to promote in @entity5			2
he says : ‘ the massive enthusiasm for @entity43 played into our long - term plan for boxing in mainland @entity24			2
’ broadcasts of a weekly boxing magazine show on @entity24 tv and first promotions in @entity131 have helped pave the way			2
support for boxing there – where once it was banned – is reported to be forthcoming from the man now considered by many to be the most powerful @entity24 leader since chairman @entity139 , president @entity139			2
a fight between @entity11 and @entity4 would be one of the most anticipated in boxing history not that it is essential for the record - breaking event to take place out here			1
@entity4 will enter the ring for his world title defence against @entity148 ’s @entity19 at midday on sunday , @entity5 time , that will be 11pm saturday night in @entity148 , 8pm in @entity151			1
‘ that would be the same time if took place in @entity96 , ’ says @entity25			2
‘ so it works perfectly wherever it happens			0
in @entity24 they like getting up on the morning and switching on as they are having breakfast			2
’ @entity4 is happy either way			2
the @entity162 congressman says : ‘ i love fighting in @entity96 but when @entity165 box in @entity5 it feels like a home game			1
this is only a 90 - minute flight from @entity168 and we ’re expecting at least 5,000 of my fans who ca n’t always afford the cost of travelling all the way to @entity20			0
' and the love of boxing among hundreds of millions of @entity24 is exciting for the sport			2
boxing owes a great debt to @entity43 for opening up his homeland			0
’ @entity4 beat @entity179 on points in his last fight , which was held in @entity96 @entity11 beat @entity182 in their re-match in @entity96 earlier this year the @entity4 has also boxed twice in front of 50,000 - plus crowds in the high - tech @entity188 stadium in @entity190 , which is like to be another bidder for the @entity11 fight			1
both men are expected to be in action twice next year , in may and september			0
this weekend @entity4 finds himself fighting for a billion more reasons than his @entity197 welterweight title			0
his purse here is believed to be a minimum of $ 25m			0
he and @entity11 would be looking to split at least $ 250m from @entity201			1
since he has already acceded to @entity11 ’s several demands – including a 60 per cent majority of their earnings – he would thus bank not less than $ 100m , with @entity206 getting a minimum $ 150m			1
the @entity4 is a heavy favourite to beat @entity19			1
assuming he does , the reluctant @entity11 can expect to receive an offer which no man who goes by the name money can conceivably refuse			0

@entity4 fights @entity19 in @entity5 on saturday
if @entity4 fought @entity11 it could be worth $ *1billion*
if the mega fight happens it could be held in @entity24 or @entity96
