the financial rewards of @entity2 ’s continued academy excellence were blindingly obvious last summer , but @entity3 run the south coast club close in terms of money generated from their youth products			1
a study carried out by the @entity10 shows @entity3 have benefited hugely from the @entity12 ’s wealth over the last three years - with the country producing players worth more than any other on the continent			0
only @entity2 have been paid higher transfer fees for players brought through their youth system than the @entity21 side in that time throughout the whole of @entity23			1
@entity2 have taken more money for their youth stars than any other side in @entity23 since 2012 @entity28 's move from @entity3 to @entity29 helped the @entity31 side rake in profits from their academy @entity34 ( right ) joined @entity35 in the summer but was immediately loaned back to @entity31 @entity36 earned from selling homegrown players since 2012 @entity38 left @entity3 for @entity39 before later sealing a switch to @entity41 @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity44 made 90.2million euros ( £ 64.4m ) for @entity2 as they moved to @entity41 , @entity35 and @entity45 respectively at the end of last season			1
but interestingly it is @entity3 – midtable in @entity31 ’s top division - who were the most profitable of the rest			2
and that ’s thanks in no small part to the @entity12			0
@entity28 ( @entity29 ) , @entity38 ( @entity39 ) and @entity34 ( @entity35 ) have all sealed permanent switches to @entity56 since 2012 and count for the majority of @entity3 ’s 76million euros recouped			1
while they have been able to lean on @entity60 this year – the @entity62 striker was immediately sent back on loan – they are renowned for taking the money for their sellable assets			0
they sold five academy stars in that period in contrast to @entity71 ’s two – @entity72 and @entity73			0
@entity74 snapped up the former for around 30m euros last summer , with city rivals real taking @entity77 a year previous			0
it is @entity21 who garner the most profit on their academy stars , with the @entity12 third @entity43 ( left ) and @entity44 both left @entity84 's for bigger things last summer unsurprisingly @entity87 and @entity88 both figure in the top 10 after selling off a raft of players who were unlikely to impact on their first team for modest profits			1
@entity94 ’s move to @entity95 mean @entity97 figure ahead of the @entity99 giants , with @entity100 nestled beneath @entity101 after earning just over 50m euros			1
the research puts into perspective a lack of homegrown talent emerging from top - flight clubs outside of @entity2 ’s buzzing academy			2
@entity108 , @entity45 and @entity109 are the only other domestic sides included in @entity23 ’s top 20 ; each of @entity39 ’s five players sold – @entity113 , @entity114 , @entity115 , @entity116 and @entity117 – were deemed surplus to requirements at @entity120 , with four of them having to drop down a division in the search of regular football			2
a large proportion of @entity109 ’s profits was down to @entity128 ’s move to @entity129 , and it is unquestionably @entity2 who continue to lead the way in nurturing talent .			0

@entity44 , @entity43 and @entity42 all left @entity2 last summer for big money
but @entity3 take 76million euros from homegrown *sales* since 2012
@entity71 , @entity100 and @entity97 complete the top five in @entity23
