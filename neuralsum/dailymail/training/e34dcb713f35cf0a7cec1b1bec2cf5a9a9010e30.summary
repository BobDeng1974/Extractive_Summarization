the wife of a teacher accused of raping young boys at a school in @entity4 says he was betrayed by the parents of students from her own nursery class			1
@entity10 made headlines around the world this week when she was pictured reaching out to her husband @entity13 as he stood behind bars awaiting trial			1
the 43 - year - old , who teaches alongside her husband at the @entity18 , is adamant he is innocent but worries he will be convicted and sentenced to up to 15 years in jail because of the country 's high conviction rates			1
she said : ' my husband has a strong character but that does n't mean that on the inside this has n't been extremely demoralising for him			2
' although he is optimistic [ the case will be dropped ] he is extremely fearful that the outcome could be very unfavourable because there is quite a high conviction rate in @entity4 for criminal cases			2
the allegations are part of a wide - reaching case that has shook the prestigious school - which is attended by the children of foreign diplomats and @entity4 's elite - to its core			1
earlier in the year five school cleaners were accused of raping a young boy and a woman was accused of being an accomplice			1
one of the cleaners has since died in police custody			2
officers say he committed suicide by drinking bathroom cleaner			2
@entity10 and teaching assistant @entity71 , known as @entity72 , were later accused of sexually abusing the same boy on june 6 - the second from last day of school			1
recalling the moment they found out , mrs @entity10 said : ' @entity13 got a phone call from the head saying another parent had come forward alleging that he and @entity72 had abused this boy			1
' i looked at my husband and he was white			2
i remember clearly the first thing that came out of my mouth was , ' how could someone be so inhumane to make allegations like that so recklessly and carelessly '			1
' i was furious because i knew this kind of allegation against a teacher is absolutely the worst allegation that could be made , and once it is made and it is public , your name is all over the place and you have no control over that			2
' there has never been a more challenging and emotionally frustrating and tumultuous time in my life			2
one allegation by one woman has destroyed so many people 's lives			1
' the amount of stress it has caused @entity13 as a family , and our families abroad , our friends , our colleagues , is enormous			2
' everyone was shocked and appalled			2
' people who know @entity13 and know @entity72 , know these are two absolutely good - intentioned well - rounded , balanced , very kind and gentle , well - respected members of our school community			2
@entity10 , visiting her husband yesterday , says he could not even pick the boys he is supposed to have abused out of a crowd @entity13 and @entity10 , pictured here attending a friend 's wedding in @entity122 , @entity4 , are staying together despite allegations he raped and sexually abusing young boys at a @entity39 school attended by the children of foreign diplomats and @entity4 's elite @entity43 teacher @entity42 , right , kissed his wife @entity129 prior to the start of his trial hearing at @entity132 in @entity39 , @entity4 , last week ' even our friends back home , our colleagues back in @entity43 , people we have met around the world , are shocked and appalled that these allegations have been brought forward			1
' these people know that @entity13 is innocent and know that @entity72 is innocent - and they know these allegations are ridiculous			1
' @entity10 , who met his wife on a date in @entity144 before marrying in @entity145 in 2007 , has so for spent more than three months in the notorious @entity44 awaiting trial			1
he sleeps on a bench in a 6ft by 15ft mosquito - infested cell , separated from the main population of the prison			2
mrs @entity10 hopes the case will be thrown out this coming tuesday and says @entity10 's legal team will argue that the accusations in the inditement are too vague			1
' they did n't specify a date in any of the alleged assaults			0
there are no specific dates , ' she said			0
' it could have happened anywhere between january 2013 and march 2014 or sometime in 2013 or 2014 - at a time that could not precisely be remembered			0
that 's actually written in the indictment			1
' so the fact the prosecutor has prepared the inditement without a date or a specific time is against @entity4 law			0
for someone to defend themselves they have to know when it is alleged to have happened			0
' according to documents , the alleged victims told police that @entity10 raped them in a secret room in the basement of the school while a female videotaped the attack			1
the accusations have been especially difficult for mrs @entity10 , as the alleged victims came from the nursery year groups she taught			1
but she says she has never doubted her husband for an instance , describing them as a couple who do ' everything together '			0
she said : ' my husband and @entity72 are named as having abused these boys that they do n't even know			0
' they could n't pick them out of a crowd			0
@entity10 , pictured here visiting her husband yesterday , told @entity197 : ' the amount of stress it has caused @entity13 and i as a family , and our families abroad , our friends , our colleagues , is enormous ' @entity43 teacher @entity42 , left , held hands with his wife @entity129 prior to the start of his trial hearing at @entity132 in @entity39 , @entity4 , last week @entity42 , pictured left , faces up to 15 years in jail if he is found guilty of sexually abusing young boys at the school but his wife is standing by him ' i taught kindergarten and before that early - childhood , so students between three and six - year - olds			1
' i was there all the time			0
i would walk past his office four times a day			0
' the building where the alleged crimes are alleged to have taken place is a massive aquarium and made of glass walls			0
there is not private space in that entire building			0
' ' we are not the type of couple who do things separately			0
when we met we were both in our mid-thirties and were overjoyed to find each other			0
we have a very close relationship			0
there is nothing that would ever give me the opportunity to doubt , there is no doubt			0
' the school has also backed @entity10 and @entity71 , with nearly 100 people turning up to support them on the first day of their trial , on tuesday			1
mrs @entity10 says it would have been even greater if it had not been a school day			1
she said her husband has been an integral part of the local community and had invested in 15 local charities with the aim of inspiring young people			0
but they are both now questioning whether they will stay in the south - east @entity259 country should the trial be dismissed			0
' he feels like he has given so much [ to the community ] and this is what he has got back in return			0
it just is n't fair , ' added mrs @entity10 , who said they had been hoping to start their own family soon			1
' ideally , we would like to stay			0
we have had nothing but a fabulous experience in this country			0
' the people are very warm the culture is very rich			0
it 's a fascinating and diverse archipelago of islands			1
it 's an unbelievable country , that way			1
' but on the human side - one or two or three individuals have really made our life a horrific experience since june			0
