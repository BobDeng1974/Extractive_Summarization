by @entity1 reporter last updated at 2:46 pm on 28th july 2011 stand on a certain bridge in @entity3 , hold you breath and get ready to be amazed by what you see			1
there are 1.5 million bats living under a bridge in @entity11 that make up the world 's largest urban bat colony , and a historic drought is making them hungrier than ever when they come out for food			1
it ’s good news for the people who gather each evening just a few blocks from the state @entity23 building to watch their spectacular nightly trips into the nearby @entity26 to find nourishment			0
spectacular sight : there are 1.5 million bats living under a bridge in @entity11 that make up the world 's largest urban bat colony , and a historic drought is making them hungrier than ever when they come out for food the drought has killed off crops in @entity3 , and that in turn has killed off those delicious pests the @entity41 free - tailed bats consider dinner			1
they are leaving home earlier than usual each night to find food , giving the locals in the bat - crazy city a few more minutes to watch the normally - nocturnal critters fly before the sun goes down			2
each night they stream from under a bridge by the hundreds of thousands in a black cloud so large that it shows up on a local weather radar			0
‘ it 's wonderful for people to be able to see them , and they are really spectacular , ’ said bat conservationist @entity54			0
‘ but it 's an indicator that things are a little tougher for the bats			0
’ @entity11 resident @entity61 joked : ‘ they 're attracting the tourists to the bridge earlier in the evening			1
that becomes a serious impediment to getting across the river for @entity68			0
’ the daylight departure is a bittersweet phenomenon , enjoyable to bat lovers only because naturalists do not see any negative long - term effects if the drought ends soon			2
crowds : people watch millions of the @entity77 emerge from the @entity78 in @entity11 , @entity3			1
the @entity41 free - tailed bats have been flying from the bridge for more than 20 years mr @entity54 said up to two years of drought is a natural cycle and wo n’t affect the species as a whole			1
but some scientists fear it ’s not a regular drought but a change coming thanks to global warming			0
‘ if we have an extended drought for many years , that could affect the population of the @entity41 free - tails , ’ he said			1
‘ it 's wonderful for people to be able to see them , and they are really spectacular			0
but it 's an indicator that things are a little tougher for the bats ' bat conservationist @entity54 an extended drought could be a double whammy for central @entity3 farmers , who depend on the bats to remove some 1,000 tons of insects and pests from the air each night			1
a study in 2006 showed that area cotton farming , which was a $ 4.5million - a - year industry at the time , saved some $ 750,000 - a - year from pestilence thanks to the @entity41 free tails			1
some 100 million bats live in @entity3			1
the largest bat colony in the world resides in a cave northwest of @entity118 , with more than 20 million bats living there			1
the @entity41 free - tails summer in central @entity3 and winter in @entity41			1
big eaters : the bats under the bridge consume 10,000 to 30,000lbs of bugs every night and bring in about $ 8million in tourist revenue every year from the nearly 100,000 people who visit the bat colony each summer around march , about 750,000 pregnant females come to downtown @entity11 and nest under the @entity131 , just blocks from historic @entity132 and the governor 's mansion			1
a few months later , they have their babies - one offspring per year - and their numbers double to 1.5 million			1
‘ if we have an extended drought for many years , that could affect the population of the @entity41 free - tails ' bat conservationist @entity54 the nightly spectacle , which draws visitors from all over the world , lasts through about october , when the bats return to @entity41			1
the bats moved into @entity11 in the 1980s when the bridge , then 70 years old , was reinforced with beams that surprisingly turned out to be a perfect habitat for them			1
at first , locals were revolted by the idea , and ignorant of the benefits of having them as neighbours			0
there was even talk of extermination			0
but then an education campaign by the founder of mr @entity54 's group @entity162 , dr. @entity163 , turned that around			0
now , @entity11 embraces its friends under the bridge			2
new arrivals : around march , about 750,000 pregnant female bats come to downtown @entity11 and nest under the @entity131 , just blocks from historic @entity132 and the governor 's mansion there is a huge bat sculpture next to downtown			2
the @entity173 of @entity11 is the bat - ini and the bat conservation group moved its headquarters from @entity177 to @entity11			2
the once - reviled bats are now a point of pride for @entity11 and coveted by neighbouring cities			2
‘ the bats are our unofficial mascot			0
we even had a minor league hockey team ( the @entity185 ) named after them at one time			0
their return each spring marks the beginning of festival season			0
and , they 're weird			0
just like @entity11 ' @entity11 resident @entity191 the @entity192 works closely with mr @entity54 's group now to adapt new bridges and roadways across @entity3 in the same manner as @entity197 to attract bats			1
in @entity11 alone , the bats bring in some $ 8million from eco-tourism			2
but that 's not the only reason @entity11 , which loves to brag about its individuality , adores them			0

1.5 million bats who live under a bridge in @entity3 are @entity11 tourist attraction
drought is killing crops and bats ' bug dinners , so they are leaving earlier
scientists *concerned* drought could affect population of @entity41 free - tails
