@entity0 will screen a controversial documentary tonight in which a paedophile speaks openly about his attraction to four - year - old girls			1
the broadcaster has been criticised by victim support campaigners for giving airtime to the 39 - year - old man , called @entity9 , and encouraging him to discuss his urges			1
the @entity11 in @entity12 [ @entity13 ] said victims would be ‘ offended ’ by the film and said it should have devoted its airtime and resources to helping people who have been abused as children			1
in @entity37 , a series of experts argue that men like @entity9 – who claims he has never offended and who has no criminal record – should not be treated like ‘ evil monsters ’			1
the programme makers suggest paedophiles should be given more support to help them control their urges before they offend			1
they persuaded @entity9 , who did not give his surname , to talk openly about his own experiences despite the risk of reprisals			2
he said he first realised he was a paedophile in his mid- 20s			2
‘ it is not the only thing i am but it plays a large part in the make - up of who i am as a person , ’ he said			0
‘ i would much prefer not to have these feelings and these attractions but i have them , and that ’s difficult			0
i have an age of attraction that starts , depending on the individual , as low as five , roughly			0
four , five , six			0
’ the show ’s makers said police have no record of @entity9 having been convicted and he insisted he had never abused a child			1
he said : ‘ a lot of people automatically assume that because i think or feel that way , then i am potentially going to abuse a child … i certainly do n’t want to do that kind of thing			0
’ he suggests it is easier for him not to act on any urges as he is ‘ attracted to women of all ages ’			2
@entity9 said he decided to show his face on national television because he feels paedophiles should be treated for their urges rather than being demonised			1
viewers will also see @entity9 meet @entity85 , 49 , who was abused by a teacher at @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 ( pictured ) as a young boy ‘ people will probably say “ why is n’t this guy locked up			1
we should kill this guy , ’ he said			0
‘ people are just waiting for you to offend before they help you			0
if you do n’t have that help , if you do n’t have the option to come forward and say “ look i ’ve got a problem , i need help ” , then what are you changing ? you ’re changing nothing			0
’ @entity102 , @entity13 ’s chief executive , said : ‘ this documentary shines the light in the wrong areas			0
instead of feeling sorry for poor misunderstood paedophiles , we should be looking at the awful experiences of those who have been abused			2
’ however , @entity110 , from the @entity29 , said the film was ‘ fantastic ’ and that paedophilia is a ‘ public health problem ’ that needs to be addressed by treating potential offenders as well as punishing them after an offence			0
he said there are around 250,000 paedophiles in the @entity118 , and predicted many will contact helplines after seeing the film			0
@entity9 has gone to @entity122 to be treated by a support group that helps paedophiles control their urges			1
the documentary also interviewed @entity85 , who was abused at @entity127 in the 1960s and 1970s while a contemporary of @entity130			1
mr @entity85 said : ‘ i ’m not here to defend paedophiles but he has not committed a crime			1
’ the @entity37 will be broadcast on @entity0 tonight at 9pm			2
watch @entity135 on @entity136 .			0
