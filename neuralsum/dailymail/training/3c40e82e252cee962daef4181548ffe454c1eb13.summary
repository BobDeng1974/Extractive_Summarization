by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 07:26 est , 4 march 2013 updated : 12:24 est , 4 march 2013 deputy prime minister @entity2 is demanding @entity3 remains signed up to the @entity5 arrest warrant @entity3 risks becoming a ' safe haven for @entity5 's criminals ' if it withdraws from cross-border police powers , @entity2 warned today			1
the deputy prime minister is demanding @entity3 remain signed up to the @entity10 or he will veto @entity12 demands to opt out of more than 100 other justice measures			1
the stand - off risks a major @entity16 row as both parties seek to appeal to their grassroots in the wake of the @entity20 by - election			0
home secretary @entity22 has a list of 130 criminal justice measures the government wants to take back from @entity26			2
ministers will then opt back in to some measures later			1
but talks have threatened to break down , with @entity12 wanting to quit almost all of the @entity32 rules while @entity33 want to remain sign up to many more			1
after meeting crime campaginers today , mr @entity2 warned national security could be at risk if @entity3 pulled out of ' essential ' crime - fighting measures			1
the deputy prime minister said : ' while some measures of @entity5 co-operation on crime are old , out of date or defunct , the police and other law enforcement agencies consistently tell us that other measures are essential for our national security and public safety			1
' the @entity10 is one of those key measures			1
without it , victims of crime like @entity53 may never have seen those who beat her son nearly to death brought to justice , and as the police say , without it @entity3 could become a safe haven for @entity5 ’s criminals			2
' we want to improve the way the arrest warrant works			0
that ’s why we ’re introducing some changes domestically , and why we ’re talking to our @entity5 partners about reform			0
but this key crime fighting tool should be reformed , not abandoned			0
' @entity3 has a long and proud track record of leadership in the fight against organised crime and illegal immigration			0
i want to see us continuing to lead internationally on this agenda in to the future			0
' the @entity5 arrest warrant allows the @entity3 to extradite swiftly criminals from other @entity32 member states			2
@entity80 needs @entity33 votes to win a @entity83 vote on the issue			2
mr @entity2 today campaign groups @entity85 and anti-slavery @entity3			2
they were joined by former @entity89 presenter @entity88 and @entity90 , whose son @entity91 was severely beaten in @entity92 in 2008			0
mr @entity94 's attackers were brought to justice in 2012 after being arrested in the @entity3 under a @entity10			2
after the meeting , ms @entity90 said : ' we need to keep what we ’ve already got , because without the @entity5 arrest warrant we may never have got the suspects back to @entity101 and justice for @entity91			0
' my son ’s ability and other people ’s children 's ability to get justice should not be threatened by ideological battles in @entity111			0
' no one has told me what the good reasons are to pull out of this cooperation , and mr @entity2 agreed we must protect the @entity10 and other important measures			1
' @entity80 is under pressure from his mps to quit more than 100 @entity32 powers on crime and justice , but needs @entity33 support to win a @entity83 vote in a speech last year mr @entity2 warned withdrawing from the arrest warrant would leave @entity3 police trying to fight crime ' to protect the @entity3 people with one hand tied behind their back '			1
' our police can call on the resources and intelligence of the entire @entity5 crime - fighting community to hunt down and arrest murderers and escaped convicts , to stop billions from being laundered out of the @entity3 every year , ' he said to @entity138			0
' to anyone who says we do n’t need these @entity32 measures to fight crime and terrorism effectively , i say prove it			1
' prove it to the police , the intelligence agencies , the lawyers , the victims of crime charities			0
prove it to the people who deal day in day out with the worst criminals imaginable			0
' because my position is clear : i will not ask them to protect the @entity3 people with one hand tied behind their back			0
' ahead of today 's meeting , @entity157 said : ‘ we are a team of campaigners representing victims of egregious crimes perpetrated in the @entity3 and abroad , including human trafficking and slavery			0
she added : ‘ we hope to get assurances from the deputy prime minister that the @entity33 will not agree to this opt out and put in danger instruments such as the @entity10 and valuable agencies such as @entity171 , which has recently been asked by the @entity3 to take the lead in investigating the horsemeat scandal			1
’ however , the @entity12 have made clear they will not sign up to a raft of @entity33 demands leaving negotiaions on the verge of collapse			1
‘ the @entity33 tend to err on the side of being more europhile and we tend to want to sign up to as little as possible , ’ said a @entity180 source .			1

@entity33 dems threaten to block @entity180 demands to opt out of more than 100 @entity32 measures if @entity10 is dropped
@entity2 meets campaigners in *favour* of cross-border police powers
