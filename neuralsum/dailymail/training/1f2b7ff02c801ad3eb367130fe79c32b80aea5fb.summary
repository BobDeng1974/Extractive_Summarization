mps were embroiled in yet another expenses row today after it emerged that 27 are letting out their @entity4 homes at the same time as claiming taxpayers ' money to rent elsewhere in the city			1
former defence secretary @entity13 , shadow ministers @entity8 , @entity10 and @entity11 , and communities minister @entity12 are among those listed as raking in income from properties while receiving up to £ 20,000 a year in expenses			1
they have been using a loophole that was opened when expenses rules were changed after the 2009 scandal , because so many were fiddling the system			1
claims : ( top left to bottom right ) @entity13 , @entity8 @entity10 and @entity11 have all been letting out their homes while using taxpayers ' money to rent elsewhere in @entity4 , research has found although the practice does not break any rules , it will fuel concerns that politicians are still able to profit from @entity34 allowances			1
the @entity37 ’s ( @entity36 ) blanket ban on mps claiming mortgage interest came into effect this summer			1
they are now only permitted to receive up to £ 20,000 expenses for renting			1
the move was intended to head off criticism after the scandal three years ago showed politicians had been using public money to build up property portfolios			1
however , it also appears to have created an incentive for many to vacate homes they own			0
research by the @entity54 identified @entity57 mps @entity55 and @entity58 , and @entity60 ex-defence minister @entity59 among those letting out properties in the capital while also claiming expenses for renting			1
the names could only be deduced because @entity36 last night released partial postcodes of taxpayer - funded second homes - which could then be cross-referenced with the parliamentary register of interests			0
the disclosure followed linked concerns that mps are able to exploit a “ loophole ” in the rules to rent properties to colleagues , who then claim the costs on expenses			1
speaker of the @entity79 , @entity80 , is attempting to stop the release of @entity72 ' landlords it is understood that four @entity72 are currently renting from four other @entity72 - although there are no cases of home “ swaps ”			0
@entity88 , the @entity89 mp for @entity90 , lets her @entity4 flat to fellow @entity89 mp @entity91 for £ 18,720 a year			1
. mr @entity91 said : ' if i had known beforehand that the flat was owned by an mp then i probably would n’t have taken it			0
' you ’ve got to apply the test of how it looks to the man in the street , regardless of whether it ’s above board or not			0
' yesterday , commons speaker @entity80 was accused of trying to suppress details of the matter after warning @entity36 that revealing the identities of politicians ’ landlords would be a ' security risk '			0
the watchdog had been due to disclose the material in response to another @entity111 ( @entity111 ) request			0
however , the process has now been put on hold in the wake of mr @entity80 ’s intervention			0
in a letter to @entity36 , mr @entity80 insisted there was a ' very real danger ' that @entity72 ’ residential addresses could be discovered as a result of the planned publication			0
responding to the speaker ’s letter last night , sir @entity123 , chairman of @entity36 , insisted the authority ' would not , under any circumstances , release the full address ' of an mp			0
but he added : ' the policy also makes clear that we would release , on request , the names of landlords and other suppliers of goods and services where this was in support of a claim made under the scheme for business costs and expenses			2
' property : the socialist mp for @entity90 @entity88 , left and the £ 400,000 @entity4 flat , right , which she rents to fellow @entity89 mp @entity91 for £ 1,560 a month sir @entity123 said all affected mps had been contacted , asking if they had concerns about the release of their landlord ’s details			1
when details of the expenses scandal broke in 2009 it came out that dozens of @entity72 ' flipped ' their second home allowance from one property to another to use taxpayers ' money to cover their mortgage payments and pay for improvements before making a hefty profit if they sold them			1
the @entity37 phased out these payments in the aftermath of the revelations , with the transitional period for these ending this summer , following concerns that politicians were able to build up valuable property empires using the public purse			2
now they can only claim for rent , up to £ 20,000 per year , but this loophole appears to allow them to continue building up a portfolio of homes			1
some feel it is better for them financially to rent out their own home to cover their mortgage and use the new allowance to rent another property			1
however , only a third - 110 - replied			0
some 60 have indicated they have no problems with the disclosure , and 50 expressed reservations			0
' we are therefore delaying our response to the @entity111 request and will be writing to those mps concerned to give them a further two weeks to respond , ' he said			0
@entity57 @entity190 said she had grave concerns about revealing mps ’ addresses , having had her @entity4 flat and constituency home broken into			1
the @entity197 mp said she agreed with the need for transparency , but was worried about a tiny minority of people , including activists , using the information maliciously			0
dr @entity190 said : ' i am very happy for everyone to know that i have no connection with my landlord in my @entity4 address - i have never met them and i do n’t think they even live in this country			2
' but if they ( @entity36 ) publish politicians ’ home addresses then you are exposing them ( @entity72 ) to very difficult situations			0
' @entity218 , chief executive of the @entity219 ’ @entity217 , said : “ if mps are again found to have exploited the expenses system , it will be another stain on the reputation of @entity224			2
' it was the cry that ‘ it ’s all within the rules ’ combined with attempts to suppress the publication of claims that made the @entity72 ’ expenses crisis three years ago so toxic			2
whilst the rules may not technically prevent mps from renting properties to one another , it is certainly against the spirit of those rules			2
' the public ’s faith was left in tatters in 2009 and the latest allegations could endanger much of the work that has been done since then to restore public confidence in our politicians			2
' it is vital that there is total transparency in all matters relating to @entity72 ’ taxpayer - funded expenses and allowances			0

defence secretary @entity13 , shadow ministers @entity8 , @entity10 and @entity11 using legal loophole
rules changes from *original* expenses scandal in 2009 allows mps to claim up to £ 20,000 per year to rent a @entity4 *pad*
some who already own one have been letting that out to cover mortgage and then use public cash to stay elsewhere
