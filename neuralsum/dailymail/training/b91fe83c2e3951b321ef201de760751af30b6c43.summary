the concept of glorious defeat finds no favour with international footballers			2
and properly so , since anything less than victory equals failure			2
so the young men of @entity8 will take no consolation from this heart - wrenching result			1
and yet there was glory aplenty to be found in a genuinely memorable performance saturday night			2
this was not one of those sleeves - up , show - your - passion , play - for - the shirt displays beloved of so many earlier @entity8 teams			1
rather , it was enormously skilful , marvelously heartening and authentically inspired			2
it took a shrewd , capable and massively experienced @entity24 team to their mental and physical limits			1
and it vividly demonstrated the wealth of emerging talent on which the country may now call			2
head boy : @entity31 climbs above @entity32 to put @entity24 2 - 1 up match winner : @entity31 's goal proved the difference between @entity8 and @entity24 centre of attention : @entity31 gestures at full time as @entity24 celebrate victory over @entity8 @entity8 have not figured prominently in @entity42 ’s @entity41 calculations			1
when waiters , taxi - drivers and bartenders — all the usual oracles — have offered their forecasts , they have naturally tended to cite the home team , along with @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity24			1
if @entity8 were ever mentioned , we sensed that politeness rather than confidence was the motive			2
as for @entity57 players , @entity55 won the odd glimmer of recognition , but the most popular by far was a non-combatant , @entity60			2
and @entity8 favoured this relative anonymity			2
after the wasted years of the so - called ‘ golden generation ’ , this is a quite different camp			1
by common consent , the preparations were ideal ; young men with reputations still to win submerging their egos and eagerly subscribing to the team ethic			2
up in arms : @entity55 protests to refereee @entity72 as decision goes against @entity8 smothered : @entity24 keeper @entity74 and @entity75 manage to stop @entity55 scoring equally impressive was the approach of @entity78			1
lazily categorised as a cautiously defensive coach , for this , the most important match his nation have played in four years , @entity78 sent out the most adventurous @entity8 team in more than a decade			0
only three of the @entity8 starting @entity85 had experience of the @entity41 finals			0
on the one hand , it spoke of naivety			0
on the other , it ensured that the majority had been spared the extended calamity of @entity94 in 2010			0
back home , it seems , some of the old optimism had finally emerged			0
it remains one of sport ’s most perplexing phenomena , the ability of the @entity57 football fan to obliterate past experience and dream of the end of the rainbow			0
mercifully , it has been relatively restrained these past months , but it was simply biding its time			0
@entity42 television chose to illustrate this by visiting a pub in @entity117 ’s @entity116			0
‘ who ’s going to win , lads , ’ inquired the @entity42 @entity118			0
‘ ing - er - land ! ! ’ bawled the drinkers , with much fist - pumping			1
young guns : @entity125 was one of a number of players playing their first @entity41 game for @entity8 danger man : @entity125 ( right ) was a constant threat through the middle for @entity8 brave : @entity133 shoots at goal under pressure from @entity24 striker @entity31 but while the game began with appropriate discretion in the @entity139 heat , the chief obstacle to @entity57 ambitions began to assert himself			1
@entity143 is elegantly professorial , treating the game as if it were a series of problems awaiting solution			1
he padded stealthily through the heart of midfield , shaping a pass here , throwing a feint there , generally organising affairs to his own satisfaction			1
it was one such deception which allowed @entity156 a low drive through a crowd to defeat @entity158 after 35 minutes			0
@entity8 could consider themselves rather harshly done by at that stage , but the spirit engendered over the past months would not be subdued			0
the equaliser was a small masterpiece , from @entity55 ’s exquisite chipped cross to @entity165 ’s thunderous finish			0
one imagines it went down rather well in @entity167			0
@entity8 were fortunate to escape reprisal for the remainder of the half , but the young men never stopped believing , working , earning the right to play			0
@entity174 maestro : @entity143 ( centre ) again pulled the strings for @entity24 in midfield in @entity178 tormentor : @entity143 skips past @entity180 as @entity24 start to control the game it may not have been football to distract the saturday - night neutrals on @entity185 , but it was honest and thoughtful and utterly compelling			1
all the more reason , then , to curse the sublime goal which @entity31 , formerly of the @entity190 parish , put away in 50 minutes			1
@entity31 once revealed his celebrated persecution complex with a plaintive t - shirt slogan : ‘ @entity193 ? ’			1
because , when his mind is on his game , he is capable of goals like this			1
the more the game progressed , the more we recognised that the selection of @entity125 was no gamble but a piece of irrefutable logic			1
in years to come , @entity8 followers will speak of the torrid evening in @entity205 as the night the boy came of age			0
a dashing , darting , impish presence , he sought responsibility and used it admirably			0
the heart lifted in thrilling expectation each time he found himself on the ball			0
whatever the rest of this @entity41 has in store for @entity8 , @entity125 will surely emerge as a major international talent			1
head boy : @entity165 ( left ) scores for @entity8 to make it 1 - 1 against @entity24 and celebrates ( below ) ultimately , the collective effort proved in vain			1
a couple of chances from @entity55 might have gone in on a kinder occasion , as might @entity229 ’s free - kick ; wickedly struck and urgently saved			2
but @entity24 had worked themselves unsparingly , and their reserves of top - class experience finally prevailed			1
indeed , in added time , professor @entity143 actually found the energy to bounce a free - kick off the @entity8 bar			1
a two - goal advantage would have been cruelly misleading			1
things are not over , not by a long way			0
there is work to be done , important football to be played			0
but the @entity8 youngsters have made their mark on this tournament			0
@entity42 will ignore them no longer			0
for they know that the boys can play … as @entity116 could have told them .			0

@entity31 scores winning goal with brilliant header as @entity24 triumph 2 - 1
nineteen - year - old @entity125 starts game and shows great maturity
@entity143 again shows his class and pulls strings from midfield
