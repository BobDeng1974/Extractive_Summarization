friends of killer pilot @entity1 claim he is being framed for murder as part of an elaborate cover - up by his airline company to hide mechanical faults with the plane			1
they have set up a @entity10 page titled ' @entity12 , we are against the hunt ' where they have been sharing their theories about the cause of the @entity18 disaster			1
some suggest the black box voice recorder had been tampered with by @entity22 parent company , @entity21 , to make it appear as if @entity1 had deliberately crashed the plane			1
meanwhile , it has emerged that @entity1 's home that he shared with his girlfriend in @entity28 has been blurred out on @entity29 in an apparent attempt by family to quell frenetic focus on his life			1
prosecutors said @entity1 then proceeded to set the plane on a collision course with the mountain , killing all 150 people on board			1
however , commenters allege that the recordings were manufactured in some way by @entity21 to hide mechanical problems with the plane , according to a report by @entity68			2
hundreds of its followers are understood to be from the pilot 's home of @entity73 in @entity74 and its surrounding area			2
one supporter , who claims to be a former classmate , said : ' i believe in the innocence of @entity80 ! ' they also point out that the second black box data recorder had not yet been recovered from the crash site , which they claim was also proof of a cover - up			1
others also suggested that one of @entity1 's former girlfriends was paid by the media to say that he had once planned to commit a ' heinous act ' that would go down in history			1
it has also emerged that @entity1 's home that he shared with his girlfriend in @entity28 has been blurred out on @entity29 ( above ) in apparent attempt by his family to quell frenetic focus on his life @entity1 is understood to have shared his flat ( right ) with his maths teacher girlfriend @entity100 in a separate development relatives have apparently asked @entity29 to blur out @entity1 's home in @entity28 that he shared with girlfriend @entity100 from its @entity29 service			1
the move came at some point over the last week since the @entity18 disaster			2
individuals and governments can ask for @entity29 images to be blurred over privacy concerns			1
after concerns from government officials in 2010 , the internet giant offered an opt - out policy to @entity114 in order to ' obey local privacy laws			2
' around 250,000 @entity114 are believed to have taken up the offer , according to @entity68			0
the flat has been the scene of intense focus since the crash and reported claims that @entity123 , 26 , discovered that she was expecting his baby as little as two weeks ago			0
the pair , who are said to have had a patchy relationship over the last seven years , were letting the pregnancy news sink in when @entity1 crashed the jet , according to @entity114 newspaper @entity130			1
strict @entity114 privacy laws which prevented doctors treating @entity1 from telling his airline about his ' suicidal tendencies ' were introduced as a consequence of the @entity136			2
the @entity22 pilot had been forced to stop his training because of severe depression and had received psychotherapy for several years before last week 's @entity18 disaster			0
but @entity114 law meant it was left entirely up to him to volunteer his mental health problems to his employer , something he failed to do with devastating consequences after tearing up a sick note for the day of the crash			0
the findings from the investigation have prompted heated debate in @entity74 on a patient 's right to privacy , with chancellor @entity154 proposing an inquiry to re-examine the law			0
draconian legislation was initially brought in after @entity157 to prevent a repeat of government spying during the @entity161 era and subsequently the @entity163 secret police in @entity74			0
this extends far beyond confidential medical data , however , to stringent protection of someone 's identity , meaning many @entity114 publications only referred to @entity1 as @entity170 , even after his death			2
further data protection laws traced back to 1907 , which enshrines the ' right to your own picture ' , also mean images can only be published with the individual 's consent			0
with respect to medical data , the criminal code means doctors are only allowed to breach confidentiality when they have reason to believe that sharing their knowledge could prevent ' a particularly serious crime ' or a threat to someone 's life			0
they can face a year in prison if they wrongly breach privacy , but up to five years in jail for withholding ' credible information about the planning or commission ' of serious acts like murder			0
despite the variation in sentences , doctors have tended to favour the individual 's privacy			0
many in @entity74 are now debating whether the potential to neutralise threats to public safety should trump doctor - patient privilege .			0

supporters set up @entity10 page ' @entity1 , we are against the hunt '
claim black box was doctored to make it appear he deliberately crashed jet
his home is *muzzed* from @entity29 after apparent *request* by his family
