by @entity0 published : 03:16 est , 29 march 2012 updated : 08:59 est , 29 march 2012 for the ‘ @entity3 ’ robot , clearly , the only way is up			2
this is a tiny four - wheeled surveillance machine with an amazing trick up its sleeve – it can spring an incredible 30 - feet into the air			1
footage of @entity3 performing its circus tricks has been uploaded onto @entity11 by its manufacturer , @entity13 robotics firm @entity12			1
he is used to test chemical warfare gear so that the fabric wo n't rip at first the clip seems unremarkable as @entity3 trundles along on its small plastic white wheels			0
but then it comes to a halt as it ’s confronted by a large garage wall – and the fun begins			0
@entity3 ’s front wheels rise up and a piston shoots it into the air on to the roof of the garage			1
@entity12 says : ‘ an onboard stabilisation system keeps it oriented during flight to improve the view from the video uplink and to control landings			1
current development of @entity3 is funded by the @entity55 's @entity54			0
’ according to @entity57 nine @entity56 are being sent by the @entity55 to @entity58 for more rigorous testing			0
the clever machine is one of several ground - breaking robots developed by @entity12			1
it has also made ‘ @entity27 ’ , which it claims is the first human - shaped , human - sized robot that walks like a man			1
it can hit speeds of 4.4mph			0
the robot has been designed to act as a walking mannequin to ensure soldiers ' chemical warfare suits do n't rip			0
there is also a prototype for a robotic battlefield ' pack mule ' called @entity79			0
the mechanical quadruped - which bears a passing resemblance to the @entity83 walkers from the @entity85 films - has a series of improvements on its predecessor which will leave the @entity90 cowering in its kennel			0
and recently the firm broke the record for legged machines with @entity95			2
it resembles the cat - like @entity97 , seen in the @entity99 2 movie , and in tests recently the speedy machine managed to run at 18mph , which means it would be able to outrun most humans			2
@entity79 : the robot horse prototype , made by @entity12 , is designed to carry military equipment in battle to make soldiers lighter and more mobile @entity111 's amazing : the robot cheetah limbering up at 10mph			1

made by @entity13 robotics firm @entity12 , the machine has a piston that shoots it *skywards*
