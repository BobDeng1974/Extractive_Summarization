@entity1 ’s £ 600 million free school meals plan has suffered a blow after a @entity4 pilot scheme showed that children who switch from ‘ unhealthy ’ packed lunches to cooked meals are no healthier			1
supporters of the initiative to give free school meals to all pupils in the first three years of primary school say fattening food in packed lunches is fuelling rising levels of obesity among children			1
but a two - year scheme to test the school meals initiative , in which tens of thousands of children had cooked meals instead of packed lunches , has found there was no change in their health or body mass index , a measure of a person ’s healthy weight based on height and gender			1
@entity1 's proposed school meal plan suffered a blow after @entity4 pilot scheme showed children who switch from packed lunches to cooked meals are no healthier a report for the @entity34 found that although children ate fewer of the fatty and sugary items often found in lunch boxes , such as crisps , sandwiches , sweets and fizzy drinks , they made up for it by eating more roast potatoes and chips in the cooked school meals			1
moreover , children who previously had a packed lunch and a hot meal at home in the evening were eating extra because they had two cooked meals a day			2
the findings were seized on by critics of the @entity54 leader ’s initiative unveiled at the party ’s conference in @entity57			0
professor @entity58 , director of the @entity59 at @entity60 , said : ‘ this is an expensive political gimmick and it is very doubtful that it will contribute much either to the health of the children or their education			0
‘ the reason why it wo n’t have much of an impact on obesity is that children spend a relatively small part of their lives at school , so any obesity will be down to their whole way of life with their families , not just those few hours in school			2
’ the @entity81 study into the two - year scheme , published last year , said that although nearly all primary children in the two pilot areas – @entity85 and @entity86 in @entity87 – were eating cooked meals rather than packed lunches , there was no weight loss			1
the report said that though children were eating fewer packets of crisps and more vegetables at lunch they could be eating more fatty food outside school hours to compensate			0
the study by @entity102 , a social research charity , said there was ‘ no evidence that the free school meal pilot led to significant health benefits during the two - year pilot period			2
for example , there was no evidence of any change in children ’s body mass index			0
’ professor @entity58 , director of the @entity59 at @entity60 , described the scheme as ' an expensive gimmick ' the researchers cautioned , however , that two years could have been too short a period to see health improvements , and pointed out there were other benefits such as a boost in the pupils ’ academic achievements.itch from ‘ unhealthy ’ packed lunches to cooked meals are no healthier			1
