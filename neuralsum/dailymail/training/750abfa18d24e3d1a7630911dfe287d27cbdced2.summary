@entity0 has developed a model to predict a hit film with 94 per cent accuracy , right down to the box office takings on opening weekend			1
using search data and applying it at various stages before a film 's release , @entity0 says it can predict the success of upcoming releases a month before their release , and even box office takings the weekend after opening			1
in a blog post titled ' @entity16 with @entity17 ' , @entity18 , principal @entity20 for @entity0 , says that searches for movie trailers made four weeks before a film premiers can be used to determine opening weekend revenue			2
prediction : the new model for predicting movie success could help movie marketers to make a film more appealing to audiences if data shows it 's doomed to opening weekend failure at the box office according to @entity18 , using the trailer - search data along seasonal information and a film 's ' franchise status ' ( i.e. whether it 's a @entity38 or twilight movie ) , can predict the opening weekend box office takings with 94 per cent accuracy			1
to predict within one week out from a film 's opening , @entity0 uses search volume for a film 's title rather than its trailer and combines it with data such as theater counts to make predictions that are 92 per cent accurate			1
big decision : according to @entity0 's research , moviegoers consult 13 sources before deciding which movie they 're going to go and see ' in the seven - day window prior to a film 's release date , if a film receives 250,000 search queries more than a similar film , the film with more queries is likely to perform up to $ 4.3 million better during opening weekend , ' @entity18 writes			1
' when looking at search ad click volume , if a film has 20,000 more paid clicks than a similar film , it is expected to bring in up to $ 7.5 million more during opening weekend			2
' and the blog post seems to show that deciding to see a film on a whim is a thing of the past for most people			0
according to research conducted by @entity0 , a moviegoer will consult 13 sources before making a decision to see a film , and film searches on @entity0 were up 56 per cent from 2011 to 2012			2
leaving a trail : @entity0 searches for movie trailers are a surprisingly accurate predictor of box - office success the search giant has also developed a formula that can predict how movies will perform at the box office the week after their opening weekend with 90 per cent accuracy by analyzing paid ad clicks rather than search statistics			1
' our hypothesis is that once a film has opened , search ad clicks are a strong indicator of intent to purchase a ticket whereas the intent associated with a search query is more varied ( i.e. , undecided moviegoers searching for reviews ) , ' writes @entity18			0
hit : several studios passed on @entity104 , which insiders predicted would bomb			0
it went on to become a huge success , and is expected to take in more than $ 330 million worldwide , a figure @entity0 's new system could possibly have predicted so how well does the system work ? according to @entity112 , @entity0 's system could have predicted the @entity114 stripper flick @entity115 was going to be a big success			0
@entity117 was hoping for $ 15 - 20 million on the film 's opening weekend , but it ended up grossing $ 39 million			2
@entity0 's model would have predicted $ 40 million			0
' ultimately , it is this online engagement that gives us tangible insight into intent , arming movie marketers with actionable data in their never - ending quest to quantify â € ˜ movie magic , â € ™ ' @entity18 writes			0
it 's not yet clear what these new predictive powers mean for movie - goers , but movie marketers will definitely be paying close attention .			0
