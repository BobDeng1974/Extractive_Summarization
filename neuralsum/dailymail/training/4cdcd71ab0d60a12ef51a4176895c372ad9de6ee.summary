@entity0 saw his half - time rant pay off instantly as @entity2 fought back to beat @entity3 2 - 1 and climb out of the relegation zone			1
after @entity7 had given the hosts an early lead , the under - fire @entity6 boss tore into his players at the break and sent on striker @entity12 , who equalised six seconds after the restart			1
fellow substitute @entity14 then set up @entity16 's winner			1
@entity0 turned @entity2 's game at @entity3 with two substitutions and an angry team talk ' there were a few strong words , ' admitted @entity0			1
' i reminded them about the fundamentals of a @entity26 game and we came out with a much stronger attitude			0
@entity12 ( centre ) celebrates equalising for @entity2 after coming on as a half - time substitute @entity16 then marked his first start for @entity2 with the winning goal for @entity0 's side ' we were a bit unlucky because we lose @entity35 [ @entity36 ] just two hours before the game ' we 'd worked all week thinking that he 'd be fine so it was a bit of a shock to lose him			1
his knee was swollen today as a reaction to yesterday 's training			0
' so we had to go with @entity16 and i knew that probably would n't suit him but we needed to give it a go because of the way we 'd worked all week			1
' we were giving too much possession to @entity3 , too much space			1
' @entity0 celebrates @entity2 's victory over @entity3 with @entity52 , ( right ) his assistant manager @entity0 deserves credit for the half - time introductions of @entity12 and @entity14 - a move he said was down to offering a threat			1
it clearly helped move @entity2 's performance up a level , as did his half - time ' team talk '			1
he added : ' we just said to them after , it 's not nice as a manager to go in and bark out orders but sometimes it 's necessary just to shake people up because we needed shaking up			0
' @entity3 manager @entity68 ( above ) believes his side are lacking in mental strength striker @entity7 ( centre ) had headed @entity3 into the lead in the 18th minute things would have been so different had @entity3 showed a cutting edge in the first half			1
head coach @entity68 believes they deserved more from a display undone by @entity12 's sucker punch			2
' it was a shock because after that it all changed in this moment , ' said the @entity80 , who was not even back in his seat when the substitute scored			0
' seven or six seconds before , all was happiness and there was good energy in the stadium			0
our supporters were happy and believed that we would get a good result			0
' but in this moment , i think it was difficult to manage in our head			0
our heads had gone and we started to take rash decisions on the pitch			0
@entity14 ( centre ) was another second half substitution that helped turn the game in @entity2 's favour ' it was difficult because 12 or 14 minutes later , we conceded again another goal			1
at 2 - 1 , it was difficult			2
' @entity68 's main complaint after the match was the lack of mental strength displayed by the @entity3 squad			2
it undid what he called their best half of their season on what is not the first time the @entity3 boss has bemoaned his players ' mentality			1
' it is not something where you can analyse the action , sort the tactical situation and move the players , ' @entity68 said			2
@entity125 had an uninspiring game after impressing in midweek in the @entity127 for @entity3 ' with mentality , we need to work hard			2
we need to be more strong , like a team			0
' we need to speak , we need to create a different situation on the training ground and work			0
' we know how but always you need to spend time to work in this area			2
it is not the same as in physical or tactical situations			0
it is a different area			0

@entity0 *unimpressed* as @entity2 trailed @entity3 1 - 0 at half - time
he tore into his players and made some *smart* second half switches
@entity12 and @entity16 goals *overturned* *deficit* for big win
