lead : @entity59 slotted the @entity11 ahead after 22 minutes as @entity8 struggled to get going while the latest share issue and the implications it could have were it to be under - subscribed stole the headlines in the build - up to this encounter , @entity0 would n’t have needed to be told of the seriousness of the situation on the park had @entity11 held on to their advantage and @entity8 had fallen six points behind leaders @entity14 already			1
after @entity29 had netted in between goals from @entity11 ’s @entity59 and @entity55 , which handed the visitors a deserved first - half lead , the home side stepped up their efforts after the break when @entity0 made two significant changes			1
he was rewarded when one of those replacements — @entity34 — immediately equalised , before @entity36 headed them in front and fellow sub @entity35 made sure of the points with a late strike			1

@entity37 ’s volley was initially blocked by keeper @entity161 , but the ball rebounded out to @entity29			2
the former @entity14 defender sent a looping header back in which ended up in the back of the net when @entity44 flapped at it under pressure from @entity36			2
@entity29 then turned villain when his error allowed @entity11 to regain the lead			1
he completely misjudged a high ball , allowing @entity59 to gallop clear			2
