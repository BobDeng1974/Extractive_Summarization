as if any further evidence were needed that bald results scalp plain reason in football , it has been forthcoming in the reaction to two matches this midweek			2
the 4 - 0 defeat of @entity10 ’s virtual reserve team at @entity11 provided an eye - popping score - line , sure enough			1
but it is not by a headlining exit from that little old cup , which changes its identity more often than @entity19 swap managers , that @entity20 will be judged			2
a big win , rather than a heavy loss , in the backwater of @entity36 would have done nothing whatsoever to change that			2
nor is it by any means certain that spending £ 60million on the last player they thought of will do so , either			2
until this week @entity43 was down there somewhere below the washing powder on @entity10 ’s shopping list			1
of course he is a pretty good footballer			2
but a @entity47 , a @entity48 , a @entity49 – or even a @entity50 or a @entity51 – he is not			2
@entity53 ’s goal per game ratio is proof of that - only 22 in 124 @entity57 appearances for @entity58 , seven in 76 for @entity59 before that , just 10 in 52 games for @entity62			0
those statistics may come to take on far greater relevance for @entity65 than the goals - against tally on tuesday evening			0
as for the second of our misleading matches , @entity68 were hailed from the roof - tops for scraping past @entity73 into the @entity74 proper			1
pardon me for not coming over all faint with excitement			0
so far our resident refereeing guru , @entity77 , is one of the few to have pointed out that the @entity79 were deprived of not one , but two blatant first half penalties			0
had @entity73 converted only one of them , @entity68 would have been out and the vultures would have been swooping down on them , too			1
@entity85 was his usual oblivious self to such niceties			0
he went so far as to complain that @entity87 did not deserve to be sent off for a second yellow card , even though he should have been shown a red one earlier for the last - man foul which was @entity68 ’s second unpunished penalty offence			1
@entity85 is a good man , an exceptional manager and a purveyor of fine football – so i prefer to observe that he was reacting out of relief at this escape , not with jubilation			2
easing the burden : @entity99 ( left ) and @entity100 celebrate the @entity103 star 's goal against @entity73 @entity104 showed fighting spirit - @entity85 a spur - of - the - moment decision ? @entity99 and his @entity19 - crested cap he has reason to do so			1
his purchase of @entity99 for £ 30m would have become an almost intolerable financial burden had @entity68 not advanced to the treasure - laden stage of the @entity74			1
@entity99 eased the burden by scoring the only goal at the @entity114 on wednesday			0
however , @entity116 ’s @entity115 reject did not play anything like as wonderfully as some of his reviewers proclaimed			0
it was also depressing to see pictures of him emerging hours later from the same @entity125 night spot in @entity126 which has become a garish symbol of the @entity130 footballer ’s clubbing habit			0
not that he has picked up on all the culture just yet			0
he was wearing a cap emblazoned with a @entity19 - like cockerel			0
it is thanks to @entity99 that @entity68 have qualified in the @entity74 for a 17th consecutive season			1
that is a tremendous achievement by @entity85 and yes , overall @entity68 were better than @entity73			1
but on current form , @entity10 are not much worse than @entity68			1
not , amid all the hysteria , that you would know it			0
@entity144 staying as @entity146 president is a victory for football @entity149 has counted the numbers			1
they do not add up in his favour			0
so it will be carry on @entity154 as president of @entity146 for another four years			1
and whether the @entity157 brigade like it or not , there are millions of perfectly good reasons why that status quo is being maintained			0
there are the hundreds of millions of @entity163 dollars which @entity144 channels into the support and development of football around the world , as well as into the construction of whole villages to house the game ’s impoverished families			1
contrast that with @entity149 ’s fiefdom , @entity176 , using much of its power and resources to further swell the coffers of the richest clubs in @entity176			0
for more years : @entity144 ( right ) , with @entity149 ( left ) at the @entity163 in @entity181 no wonder the wealthy @entity182 – @entity183 and our bloated @entity130 among them – would like to see the back of @entity144			1
unsurprising , also , that all their propaganda falls on unreceptive ears elsewhere and that the rest of the world ’s football confederations are standing solidly behind @entity144 , the man who has negotiated on - going @entity163 television and marketing deals more enormous than most believed possible			1
while the @entity194 and @entity195 are spending obscene fortunes on buying and paying players , @entity146 by - and - large finance the game ’s poorer rather than noisier neighbours			1
given that @entity146 – in economic terms as well as its sphere of influence – operates on the scale of the government of a medium - sized nation , it is inevitable that some of its investments will fall into unscrupulous hands			1
what happened , after all , to so much of the @entity215 money once it disappeared into @entity217 ? nothing is perfect , @entity146 included			1
but there is a missionary element to its work under @entity144 which is virtually missing from @entity176 … and from our own @entity222 , come to that			1
the ultimate prize : @entity226 celebrate winning the @entity163 in the summer even the flawed and much - derided awarding of the @entity228 to @entity229 – which the president himself admits was a mistake given the summer heat in the @entity234 – was born as much of that zeal as by the fortune to be made there			2
inferior : @entity238 celebrate winning the @entity239 but it is n't a patch on the @entity163 the ensuing allegations of corruption have been followed by sabre - rattling here about @entity182 nations boycotting @entity229 and , for political reasons , the intervening 2018 @entity163 in @entity248			2
oh really ? the best players on earth will go along with that , will they ? not if you were watching the @entity253 in @entity181 this summer			0
the intensity with which those stars competed for the greatest prize of all far surpassed anything we see now in the @entity259 and @entity260			0
there are millions of perfectly good reasons for that , too			0
nothing enhances the earning power or the advertising , endorsement and image rights of the modern footballer like a good @entity163			0
certainly not the @entity239 of nations , by the way , which falls well short of the @entity163 in terms of excitement			0
so monsieur @entity149 will go back to ‘ my work with @entity176 , ’ a job he would have been obliged to relinquish had he taken a tilt at the @entity146 presidency which would have been doomed to failure			1
@entity280 will continue to confound the witch - hunters while delivering more lucrative @entity282 for everyone			0
and while this may not be everyone ’s ideal , at least in this area of global governance peace has broken out			0
if @entity289 typifies football , what of the @entity293 scandal ? those murky texts from @entity295 and his mate – banter as he described those racist and homophobic nuances – seem to have dropped below the radar already			1
can it be long , tragically , before the same happens with the police , their commissioner , the council fat cats and the appallingly misnamed social workers who put political correctness before the protection of hundreds of under - age girls being brutalised and gang - raped by gangs of @entity309 who shame their own community and religion ? @entity295 is said to typify attitudes in football			2
what we can be certain of is that the sexual abuse and trafficking of children in @entity293 is happening in many other cities in this supposedly civilised country of ours			2
do n’t let either of this lot get away with it .			0

@entity10 's defeat at @entity11 was an *irrelevance*
@entity10 are a team in transition and will struggle
@entity68 were lauded for scraping past @entity73
@entity144 staying as @entity146 president is a win for world football
if @entity289 is the *embodiment* of football *crassness* , the @entity293 scandal typifies the political class
