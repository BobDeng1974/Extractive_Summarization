@entity0 are preparing for up to a month without talisman @entity1 after @entity2 called him up for the @entity4			1
the midfielder was not included in his country ’s provisional squad for the tournament , which was announced last month , but has been brought in to replace the injured @entity9			2
@entity1 had fallen out of favour with the national team following his sending - off in the @entity12 against @entity13 and has not played for manager @entity14 since			1
but the 27 - year - old has been one of the top midfielders in the @entity17 this season and @entity14 has brought him back ahead of wednesday ’s deadline for finalised squads			2
@entity0 midfielder @entity1 , shielding @entity21 , has been in fine form this season here are the @entity0 matches that @entity1 will miss while at the @entity4 with @entity2 jan 10 - @entity23 ( a ) @entity17 jan 18 - @entity24 ( @entity25 ) @entity17 jan 24/25 - possible @entity27 4th round if @entity2 reach the latter stages , @entity1 will potentially miss : jan 31 - @entity29 ( a ) @entity17 feb 8 - @entity30 ( @entity25 ) @entity17 this has forced @entity0 manager @entity32 to plan for life without @entity1 for the duration of the tournament in @entity36 , which ends on february 8			1
it will come as a huge blow to the east @entity40 club as they chase a place in @entity43			0
they are currently seventh in the table , four points behind fourth - placed @entity47			0
@entity0 , who face @entity49 in the @entity27 third round tonight , are also losing @entity51 , who plays for @entity52 , and he could be joined by top scorer @entity53 if he recovers from a back problem			1
@entity32 said : ‘ we have a squad that ’s available to play @entity49 less our @entity4 of @entity59 players @entity1 and @entity51 , and @entity53 , who ’s got a back injury			1
’ song has been the driving force for @entity0 since his loan move from @entity63 in the summer , but the club ’s form in the first half of the season , which put them as high as third , is beginning to slide			1
@entity1 will miss tonight ’s game at @entity49 and @entity17 matches against @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity29			1
if @entity2 make it to the final he would also miss the clash with @entity30 and be doubtful for a trip to @entity47 on february 11			1
@entity1 , in action against @entity74 , will leave to play in the @entity4 for @entity2 @entity51 is off to the @entity4 with @entity52 and will miss @entity0 's january games @entity32 is adamant that he will not lose @entity76 for a minimal transfer fee this month — but conceded that the defender is set to leave in the summer			1
@entity76 ’s contract expires at the end of the season , meaning he is now free to sign terms with clubs outside of @entity84 ahead of a move in july			2
unless @entity84 clubs agree a transfer fee with @entity0 they are forbidden by @entity89 regulations to speak to the player , but @entity32 is convinced some are making moves — via third parties — to secure his services			2
@entity32 claimed : ‘ if he ’s not going to sign a contract then realistically i find it highly unlikely if it ’s not already verbally done			0
who knows ? only @entity76 and his agent can decide in the end			0
but it ’s difficult to think he ’s going to stay			0
‘ if you can prove that clubs have broken the rules then they ’re in serious trouble are n’t they ? but you ca n’t prove it			0
you just hear rumours of this , that and the other			0
@entity0 top - scorer @entity53 , who is suffering from a back problem , will also be absent the midfielder , on loan from @entity63 , has been instrumental for the @entity0 so far this campaign ‘ it might have nothing to do with the two clubs directly , it could be between two agents			1
so how can you relate that to the clubs ? you ca n’t , so it can all get done that way			0
’ @entity0 opened talks with @entity76 over a new deal 12 months ago , during which time @entity32 says they have made ‘ a million offers ’			2
but he believes the club can make more money by keeping @entity76 until the end of the season than selling him now			0
@entity32 said : ‘ you have to balance it out , with £ 1.8m prizemoney per place , and look at the overall income you can get in , not just that you ’re going to lose them for nothing in the summer			0

@entity1 , on loan from @entity63 , has been in fine form this season
he will head out to @entity36 for the @entity4
the @entity2 international could be away until the beginning of february
the tournament runs from january 17 until february 8
@entity0 @entity51 and @entity53 are absent with @entity52
