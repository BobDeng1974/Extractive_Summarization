' mr @entity49 's record shows he would make these reforms more difficult			2
' @entity5 is pushing for arch - federalist @entity49 ( left ) to become the new @entity37 president , but @entity159 chief @entity158 ( second left ) has emerged as a compromise candidate favoured by @entity0			1
other politicians in line for @entity40 's most powerful position include @entity117 pm @entity116 and @entity188 taoiseach @entity187 @entity49 is still the favourite to become the new @entity37 president - replacing the outgoing former @entity191 prime minister @entity57			1
