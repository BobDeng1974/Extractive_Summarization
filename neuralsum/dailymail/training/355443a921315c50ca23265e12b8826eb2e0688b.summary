@entity1 fan : @entity2 credits potatoes for her slim waist sports presenter @entity5 has a refreshing diet tip for anyone who likes food : eat more potatoes – and bread			1
in an age when even the chancellor @entity14 is said to starve himself for two days a week to keep slim , her stance seems rather radical			2
yet the tv star claims her approach is the key to a trim waist , and swears she has never cut out food groups or gone hungry			1
‘ you hear about pop stars like @entity23 or @entity24 cutting out bread because of a gluten intolerance but they have a team of dedicated cooks , ’ says the mother of two			1
‘ my worry is that celebrity stories lead to more people deciding to exclude key food groups from their diets without proper medical supervision , when that ’s not the healthiest option			1
‘ i take real pride in giving my twins @entity39 and @entity40 and my husband @entity42 well - balanced , home - cooked meals where i know exactly what we ’re eating , rather than choosing whatever option is more fashionable			0
’ and it seems she has a point			0
last month , new research suggested that a third of @entity52 avoid wheat because fad diets warn against gluten , the protein contained in the grain – despite only two per cent of the population actually having an allergy			1
while experts believe some people might suffer mild intolerances that lead to bloating and stomach aches , this clearly is n’t a motivating factor in many cases			0
the survey also found that the majority of those who go wheat - free do n’t actually know what gluten is			0
the main concern among health chiefs is that this approach is contributing to our already poor fibre intake			1
medical guidelines recommend we consume at least 18g of this indigestible type of carbohydrate found in plants ( abundantly in fruit , veg , beans , pulses and grains ) a day			0
without it our digestive system does not function properly			0
studies show those people who eat lots of it are slimmer and have a lower risk of heart disease , cancers and diabetes			1
yet the average @entity97 is said to consume just 14g a day			0
having already lent her name to the @entity100 - backed @entity99 drive to promote heart health in women , @entity2 is now working with @entity104 to try to get us to eat more fibre			1
she has altered her already admirable diet to include about 30g a day – the amount studies say protects against illness			0
that sounds a lot when you consider a slice of brown bread contains just 2g , but she did n’t feel she had to make massive changes			1
‘ often it was a matter of eating jacket potatoes with the skin on , and making sure i had high - fibre snacks in between meals , ’ says @entity2			1
‘ @entity121 , which contain about 1.8g of fibre per biscuit , were a lifesaver , and endlessly versatile in terms of adding toppings			2
@entity127 has 3g of fibre per 25g			2
a portion of beans – not just the baked variety , although they are great – will give you about 6g			0
‘ if you make sure you eat five portions of veg a day , and a couple of fruit , you ’ll easily be getting 20g of fibre from those alone			1
’ @entity139 - a - lots : since increasing her daily fibre intake , sports presenter @entity2 has felt the benefits although @entity2 , 41 , is fastidious about her health today , the former gymnast and daughter of @entity145 international footballer and manager @entity146 has suffered her fair share of illness			1
her sporting career ended due to sciatica , and she suffered a near - fatal haemorrhage in 2005 when she gave birth to her twins , now aged nine			0
and , of course , tragedy struck her family when her younger brother @entity158 died of a sudden cardiac arrest in 1992 , aged just 15 , followed by her distraught father ’s battle with the bottle			0
for these reasons , @entity2 is never complacent about her own family ’s health			0
eating more fibre does n’t have to mean munching through boxes of cardboard - like bran at breakfast			2
here are a few foods that contain surprisingly high amounts : popcorn : 6.5g ( 150g portion ) dried figs : 2.9g ( 30g portion ) avocado : 5g ( 75g portion ) peas : 4.4g ( 80g portion ) blackberries : 4.2g ( 80g portion ) pear : 4g ( 150g , compared with 1.2g per 100g for apple ) sweetcorn , freshly cooked cob : 6.3g ( 125g portion ) @entity185 : 3.3g ( 150g portion ) jacket potato with the skin on : 4.7g ( 180g portion ) @entity121 : 1.8g ( per cake ) peanut butter : 1g ( per tbsp ) ‘ however good you think your diet is , it ’s dangerous to feel you ’re fine – i know how easy it is to slip into bad eating habits , especially when you ’re incredibly busy , ’ she says			0
since increasing her fibre intake , @entity2 has felt the benefits			1
‘ i ’d been feeling bloated , especially after breakfast , and then suffered energy slumps later in the day , both of which have gone now , ’ she says			0
‘ my diet was n’t problematic , but i knew it was n’t perfect – it goes to show how you are what you eat			2
i ’ve noticed my skin improve , too			0
’ @entity2 has one concession to food fads			2
every morning she blends her own ‘ green drink ’ from a variety of ingredients , including hemp , ginger , kale , sunflower seeds and bee pollen			0
‘ i might have that with some fruit , or add in half a wholemeal bagel with some peanut butter on , both of which are high in fibre			2
' then i might have a wholemeal fruit scone for a mid-morning snack , a handful or two of unsalted almonds mid-afternoon , or an oatcake with some goat ’s cheese , and more fruit and water , ’ she adds			0
@entity233 advises anyone who wants to increase their fibre intake to do so gradually			1
she says : ‘ perhaps add 5g of fibre a day for a week , and then go up by another 5g each week until you hit the daily 30g target			2
' you should also increase your water intake and the amount of exercise you ’re doing , even if that ’s just a short walk after meals			1
‘ it ’s significant dietary change , so if you feel uncomfortable , slightly reduce your fibre intake for a few days before starting again , or see your gp if the problems persist , as a reaction to a high - fibre diet can be a sign of irritable bowel syndrome			1
