by @entity0 published : 13:20 est , 30 july 2013 updated : 18:53 est , 30 july 2013 the @entity2 's flagship rural current affairs programme @entity3 has come under fire after an investigation found it had given undue prominence to an outdoor clothing range			1
the @entity8 has censured the show after viewers complained presenters had been seen wearing @entity13 jackets in back - to - back episodes			1
programme - makers said it was ' unfortunate ' that the presenters should have chosen to wear the same brand of @entity13 outer wear , but said that it was ' coincidence rather than collusion '			1
@entity21 : @entity22 ( left ) with @entity23 and show founder @entity24 they added that @entity3 presenters , who include @entity23 , @entity22 and @entity24 , supply their own clothing and choose what they wear on shoots			2
the @entity8 's editorial standards committee , which did not identify any presenters by name , ruled that the wearing of branded clothing by the presenters did not amount to product placement , as there was no evidence that it was worn in return for payment or any other consideration			1
but it said that ' the wearing of the same visibly branded clothing by two of the programme 's presenters in the two editions of the programme did amount to undue prominence ...			1
which gave the impression that the programmes were promoting or endorsing these products			0
' the ' cumulative effect was that the branded clothing was unduly prominent ' and breached guidelines covering product prominence			2
the programmes were broadcast last november and december			0
it is not the first time the @entity2 has been forced to defend itself over criticisms of product placement			0
in 2008 , @entity62 ran seven pictures of its correspondents out on location who were all sporting @entity68 jackets , including the then economics editor @entity69 , who now presents the @entity70			0
at the time , a @entity2 insider told us : ' there is no doubt these companies like having their brands shown on the news and occasionally i have heard of firms approaching a reporter and offering them a free jacket			0
' i have heard this has happened with two people			0
technically that 's illegal because @entity2 reporters are not allowed to get any freebies			2
' @entity68 : @entity2 economics editor @entity69 ( left ) and @entity90 ( right ) were among the seven correspondents seen wearing @entity68 jackets on camera in 2008			1

@entity8 rules show gave ' undue prominence ' to the @entity98 clothing range
presenters wore jackets by the firm in back - to - back episodes
programme makers brand the slip - up ' unfortunate ' and ' a coincidence '
@entity8 did not identify any of the show 's presenters by name
the @entity2 was criticised over a similar issue back in 2008
