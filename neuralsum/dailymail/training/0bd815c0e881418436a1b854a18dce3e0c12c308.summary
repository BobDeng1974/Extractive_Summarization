by @entity0 lying six miles off the @entity3 coast , it appears to be an old oil platform to the casual observer			2
but the @entity6 , as residents call it , claims to be the world ’s smallest country , with its own @entity10 , currency , and even postage stamps			2
the tiny state ( though no other country officially recognises it as such ) occupies a 5,290sq ft @entity17 fort consisting of two concrete towers connected by an iron platform a few miles off @entity20 , in international waters			1
but since 1967 , @entity6 's residents - all 22 of them - have declared themselves independent of @entity23			2
the micronation even has its own currency , the @entity30 , and its own football team , the @entity49			0
residents make money by selling @entity6 mementoes via an online shop , as well as titles : for £ 199.99 you can buy the title count or @entity57 of @entity6 , while you can settle for @entity58 or @entity59 for just £ 29.99			1
alternatively , you can buy one square foot of the territory for £ 19.99 , a mug or a football shirt			0
@entity6 began on christmas eve 1966 after @entity33 , a former infantry major in the first battalion @entity64 , took over the fort , then known as @entity66			1
the fort had been built as one of a series of defence forts off the @entity3 coast during @entity17 before being abandoned in the 1950s			1
mr @entity33 , then 46 , was a fisherman turned pirate radio broadcaster , who had fallen foul of @entity23 broadcasting laws and wanted to find a new base somewhere outside @entity23 jurisdiction			0
@entity6 stamps : the tiny ' micronation ' also has its own currency , but largely depends on @entity23 for imports the kitchen on @entity6 boasts far - reaching sea views but is used by 22 residents so is hard to keep clean the @entity33 family designed their own crest , featuring their motto which translates as from @entity89 , @entity90 on christmas eve 1966 , he took over @entity91 with his wife , @entity32 , daughter , @entity94 , 16 , and son , @entity37 , 16 , and the following september he declared himself prince of @entity6 and his wife , princess @entity32			1
thereafter followed a series of challenges , from the @entity23 government , who sent delegates to recce @entity6 , to a group of @entity106 and @entity107 ' invaders ' , but the @entity33 family - who gave themselves the motto @entity110 ( from @entity89 , @entity111 ) - managed to hang on to the windy platform they had made their own			2
in october 2012 , @entity33 died at the age of 91 , and the @entity6 crown passed to his son , @entity37 , 63 , who is still said to live on @entity6 with his family and friends			1
the younger mr @entity33 , aka his majesty prince @entity37 , has claimed that his micronation has been recognised by @entity106 and @entity120			2
and he said @entity122 people wanting to claim independence from the @entity23 could seek inspiration from his father 's struggle			0
when @entity6 's residents are not working on maintenance or the website , they relax in the sitting room office : those who live in @entity6 run a website selling titles and other @entity6 memorabilia basic accommodation : the platform , which is now more than 70 years old , is fairly short on modern comforts he said : ' it has n’t been easy for us , but the situation is different inasmuch as @entity122 is heavily dependent on @entity23 and vice versa			1
' i do n’t believe it will ever happen but if it does , they would have our support			0
the @entity122 are great and fiercely independent people			0
' he added : ' we import from the @entity23 and @entity153 most of our provisions , apart from local produce like fish and lobsters			0
we make our own water and are 99 percent green energy producing			0
' we have something like 30 rooms of various sizes , and most of our days are spent withoffice and it work these days , processing orders from our online shop , security and maintenance			0
' the @entity33 family is are also planning to run tourist trips to their platform later this year .			1

tiny state consists of two concrete towers connected by an iron platform
*originally* built as @entity17 defence , it was claimed as ' *principality* ' in 1967
no other country recognises it as such , but locals cling to independence
lying six miles *offshore* from @entity20 , state is ' ruled ' by @entity37 , 63
his father , @entity33 , claimed platform as his own and crowned himself king
residents catch their own fish and lobster and produce drinkable water
they make money by selling titles ( a count is £ 200 ) and @entity6 memorabilia
tourist trips to the 5,290sq ft fort are being planned for later this *summer*
