taken : @entity0 was taken from her parents home in @entity3 in october 2011 and they have now expressed their hope that the little girl known as @entity6 rescued in @entity7 might be her a couple who had their daughter taken from their @entity3 home more than two years ago have revealed that they have contacted @entity7 authorities hoping that the missing girl known only as @entity6 could be theirs			1
as the search for @entity6 's identity widened into an international appeal , @entity0 , 31 , and @entity0 , 30 , who lost their daughter @entity18 in october 2011 , were reported by @entity7 authorities to be one the eight leads - four of which are from the @entity22 - out of thousands they are taking extremely seriously			1
attorney @entity24 , who has represented @entity25 and @entity26 since their daughter disappeared from her bed after an apparent home invasion , confirmed they were one of four @entity22 inquiries about @entity6 , but refused to go into further detail			1
speaking to the @entity33 , @entity24 said , ' we inquire about every child that is found and fits the age profile of @entity18			0
' we investigate all leads			2
i do n't have any further comment at this stage			0
' little @entity0 's disappearance hit the headlines across the nation in october 2011 when she was reported missing by her father when she was only 11 months old			1
she would be three - years old in november and her eyes bare more than a passing resemblance to those of @entity6 , the girl rescued from a @entity7 gypsy camp in @entity51 on wednesday			1
@entity79 , the local news station in @entity3 , produced in conjunction with the @entity73 an age - progression image , which projects what @entity18 may look like now			1
and last year , a tantalizing clue was brought to the attention of the @entity85			0
in early november , 2011 , just over a month after @entity18 vanished , @entity25 said his debit card was stolen			1
the card was suspended after he noticed a fraudulent charge for $ 69.04 made to a @entity90 website that advertises a service to legally change your name or your child ’s name online			0
fraud : one month after his daughter 's disappearance @entity0 discovered his credit card had been used to pay money to a @entity90 website that alters names by deed - poll meanwhile , today in @entity7 , @entity104 , 39 , and @entity61 , 40 , the gypsy couple accused of abducting @entity6 appeared in court to be charged with child abduction and forging birth documents			1
her case has attracted global attention , with thousands of calls from people who believe they may know her identity			1
the child – nicknamed ‘ the blonde angel ’ by the @entity7 media – was discovered last week when police raided a gipsy camp			1
dna evidence proved she was not related to the couple			0
abducting a child under the age of 14 carries a maximum sentence of ten years			0
the forgery charges relate to fake child birth certificates and two false identities used by @entity61			0
baby blue eyes : @entity0 and @entity0 have notified authorities in @entity7 that their @entity18 could be little @entity6 smiles : @entity132 kisses her little girl @entity18 before her disappearance in october 2011 back in the @entity22 , @entity18 's disappearance was not without controversy though - @entity26 claimed that an intruder must have taken her daughter from her bedroom while she was asleep in the same room - having consumed a large amount of alcohol			1
a witness said that he saw a man carrying around a baby in a diaper down the street around the time @entity18 went missing earlier this month , before the rescue of @entity6 from the camp in northern @entity7 , @entity0 and @entity0 held a candle - lit vigil to mark the second anniversary of her disappearance			1
despite the family 's determination , authorities in @entity3 said before this last week , tips into the disappearance have waned since the months after she vanished on october 4 , 2011			1
' i can not force the people who know where @entity18 is and who might have her into telling us			0
i have no control over that , ' @entity26 told the @entity165			2
' you do what you can for your baby , because it is your job as a parent to protect your child , and i was n’t able to protect her from the bad guys			0
' @entity18 was 10 - months - old when her father returned from a late work shift to find the front door open , the lights on , @entity26 asleep , his daughter 's bedroom window open and her crib empty			2
they believe that someone broke into the home and snatched the baby while @entity26 slept , and have said they think someone is bringing up the little girl as their own			1
vanished : @entity132 said that her child was taken from her house after she had fallen asleep after drinking too much ' when somebody abducts an infant , they do n't take them to hurt them , ' she said			2
' wherever she is , she is being loved and taken well care of , because they went through a hell of a lot of trouble to get her			0
' she said that she knows people have pointed fingers at them for the disappearance but she maintained their innocence - and said it will be proven when the little girl returns to them			0
a private investigator continues to work on the case , and the family still offers a $ 100,000 reward for anyone who has information that could bring the baby home			0
tragically for @entity25 and @entity26 , they have also revealed that her room remains virtually untouched two years after she disappeared without trace			1
both @entity0 and @entity0 have tried to keep a high media profile in the two years since their @entity18 's disappearance			2
initially , police assumed that they were involved in their daughter 's abduction and told @entity26 that she failed a lie detector test			2
appeals : @entity24 , ( left ) who has represented @entity25 and @entity26 ( center ) appear on the @entity85 in 2012 to appeal for the return of their child @entity18 ' they said i failed a polygraph test , ' @entity26 , 25 , told the @entity237 in the immediate weeks after @entity18 's october , 2011 disappearance			1
' and i continued to say that 's not possible because i do n't know where she 's at and i did not do this			0
' they said police have treated them like suspects and that @entity26 in particular has been preparing for the possibility of charges being filed against her			2
the mother said detectives told her : ' you did it			0
' the parents say they discovered their front door unlocked , a window open and house lights blazing , lending credence to the theory that the baby may have been snatched by an intruder			0
' the main problem i think that we 're facing is that everybody ( else ) has an alibi , ' @entity25 said			2
' i was at work			0
all these other people we were worried about ... the @entity271 said they 've been cleared			0
the only one you ca n't clear is the mother that 's at home when it happens ` cause there 's nobody else there			0
' back in @entity7 , @entity6 is in the care of the @entity284 charity and have received more than 8,000 calls about @entity6 .			1
