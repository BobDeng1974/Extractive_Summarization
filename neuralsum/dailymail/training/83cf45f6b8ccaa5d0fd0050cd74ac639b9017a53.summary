a couple from @entity1 are petitioning @entity2 to create the first ever special needs princess so that their 15 - month - old daughter @entity4 - an avid animation fan who suffers from @entity5 - might have a ' real ' role model to look up to someday			1
in their petition , which has already gained the support of more than 62,000 people , @entity11 and her partner @entity12 pay tribute to the work that @entity2 has already done in helping children to understand the difference between right and wrong through its popular animated classics			1
but they make clear that , in their eyes , the company ' comes up short in one critical area ' - the representation of disabled people - and they ask that @entity2 start taking steps towards changing the lives of special needs children around the world by casting a @entity5 princess in a future film			1
' @entity2 does a great job of depicting right from wrong			0
it has long provided wonderful moral lessons that teach our children to be good people - but sadly , the company comes up short in one critical area			2
' its movies have almost no representation of disabled people , those often bullied and looked down upon by their fellow children			2
' what wonderful lessons of diversity , compassion , and acceptance @entity2 could teach our kids if they promoted disabled characters as heroes and heroines in their beloved movies ! ' the two women , who foundedthe @entity69 , a charity aimed at providing support to families affected by @entity5 , first began the campaign after @entity4 's six - year - old sister @entity74 questioned whether her younger sibling would ever get the chance to be a real princess			1
' my partner @entity12 and i are already outspoken parent activists in the @entity81 , but it took my six year old to recognize that her baby sister @entity4 and people like her are excluded on even the most elementary level , even as children , ' @entity11 told the @entity87			1
' @entity12 and i knew we had to do something , not just for @entity4 but also for @entity74			2
' parental support : the couple 's petition has already received more than 62,000 signatures real role models : @entity4 's parents want @entity2 to create films with disabled princesses so that the 15 - month - old is able to see that she can be a hero too thus far the petition has received an overwhelming amount of support and is just a few signatures shy of the couple 's target of 63,000 supporters			1
' we started the @entity107 petition with an initial goal of 1,000 signatures , ' @entity11 added			0
' we had that in an hour ... we had the 10,000 signatures in less than a week			0
' the petition has attracted support from around the world , with many offering words of encouragement to the couple			0
' i am so happy to support this cause ! i think i would watch the movie a million times ! ' one anonymous supporter wrote , while another added : ' children with @entity5 are beautiful and innocent people who are full of love and affection and would enhance [ @entity2 's ] productions			2
' and while @entity11 plans to see the campaign through until the very end - she admits it is only the beginning as far as she and @entity12 are concerned			0
' my frying pan is just getting warmed up , ' the author wrote on her website			0
' i want to do everything in my power to make sure that @entity4 knows she is included in society , that she has worth and is amazing			0

@entity140 and her partner @entity12 are self - *confessed* @entity2 fans but believe the company needs to do more to represent disabled people
the couple want 15 - month - old @entity4 to be able to relate to the animated characters that she is so fond of
