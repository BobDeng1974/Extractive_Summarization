this is the amazing moment lumps of solid rock explode into the air as the earth sheds its outer layer in a strange geological phenomenon known as exfoliation			1
the incident is one of a number of exfoliation events to have taken place in the last month in the @entity14 range , eastern @entity15 , damaging a nearby dam			1
a local resident captured the moment and uploaded the strange event to @entity20 where it has been viewed more than 615,000 times			0
the deep rock is under extremely high pressure , but as the surface layers are worn away due to normal erosion , the pressure is reduced			0
if the rock is heated by strong sun light it will expand and then contract at night time			2
this mechanical process weakens the rock where it eventually cracks and even explodes in a spectacular fashion			2
according to the @entity46 the area suffered ' three natural rock stress release events ' in august			0
a statement from the association said : ' these events resulted in fracturing of the existing granite rock dome that forms the left dam abutment			1
fractures appear to be sheeting / exfoliation joints ( similar to that of an onion layer peeling ) , relatively thin ( approx. 1 ‚Äê 3 feet in thickness )			0
' as a result of the cracking , the nearby dam suffered a leak of about 40 gallons per minute which prompted safety officials to drain the lake while a survey could take place			1
@entity68 , survey geologist with the @entity69 said the issue of exfoliating rock is not tremendously rare			2
she said : ' it is unusual to see exfoliating rock captured on video but it is not very rare			1
it is caused when igneous rock such as granite is exposed to strong sunlight and dry conditions			2
under the intense infra red rays the rock expands and then it contracts at night			0
' this mechanical process weakens the rock until it reaches the point where it fails			0
this can happen in the @entity88 but it is not very dangerous			0
' eventually a small puff of smoke warns that the rock is approaching its breaking point then suddenly , large chunks of rock explode throwing dozens of fragments are thrown into the air			1

*scientists* forced to drain a lake as the exploding rock *threatened* a dam
the ' exfoliating ' granite rock pops as it warms under the hot desert sun
large fragments of stone are thrown into the air after it explodes
the unusual incident happened in @entity114 , eastern @entity15
