by @entity0 they have killed off 500 actors , encouraged ' a moment 's violence ' at the @entity6 's funeral and given pigs an unusual diet of , er.			2
these are the hilarious subtitle blunders that have aired on the @entity14 - leaving both staff and viewers lost for words			1
they are among many mistakes to have prompted a crackdown on the quality of subtitles - with a report set to be published by @entity23 this spring			1
one gaffe sees the broadcaster mark the @entity26 by welcoming viewers into the ' year of the whores '			1
embarrassing : the @entity14 marks the @entity26 by welcoming viewers into the ' year of the whores ' during a bulletin in january			1
the channel later insisted the error was acknowledged and quickly corrected - to ' horse ' error : a reporter 's comment that ' pigs nibble anything , even wellies ' takes on a different meaning when the last word is substituted for ' willies '			1
the mistake in 2011 later fuelled a @entity45 subtitles gaffes segment mistake : another blunder sees a court reporter quoted as saying : ' and the cat 's pornography reading was low ' the subtitling error , which happened during a bulletin at around 7pm on january 31 , saw @entity53 declare : ‘ welcome to the year of the whores			1
people around the globe celebrate			0
’ however , the channel later insisted that the error was acknowledged and quickly corrected - to the ' year of the horse ’			0
another blunder sees a reporter 's comment that ' pigs nibble anything , even wellies ' take on a completely different meaning when the last word is substituted for ' willies '			1
the mistake , which happened during a news report in 2011 , soon went viral on @entity69 - and even fuelled a @entity45 subtitles gaffes segment			2
lost in translation : last sunday , the @entity14 struggled to get to grips with the name of footballer @entity74 - misspelling his name as ' @entity77 jazz , jazz jam '			1
however , it correctly spelled the names of other players hot prospect : @entity82 broke into the @entity84 team as a winger this season - despite only being 18 and last sunday , the @entity14 struggled to get to grips with the name of 18 - year - old winger , @entity74 , who broke into the @entity84 team this season			2
the broadcaster correctly spelled the names of other @entity84 players @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 and @entity95 - before stumbling over the youngster 's name			0
seventy channels in the @entity99 currently provide subtitling services , according to watchdog @entity23			1
most of these air pre-recorded programmes - for which , subtitling can be prepared in advance			0
this means that subtitles can be synchronised to images , edited to a reasonable reading speed and checked for errors			0
however , live programming and some pre-recorded programmes have to be subtitled live - leaving them prone to mistakes			0
these subtitles are delayed by several seconds and typically scroll across the screen			0
source : @entity117 its hilarious attempts at janet , jazz , jazz and jam left those watching the programme with subtitles scratching their heads as they tried to work out what was actually being said			2
and it is n't the first time the @entity14 has misspelled a name to amusing effect			0
the broadcaster has previously referred to @entity135 prime minister @entity134 as ' mr @entity136 ' - while @entity138 leader @entity137 became ' @entity139 '			0
meanwhile , former chief medical officer sir @entity140 was once dubbed ' @entity141 and @entity142 ' - with the @entity143 renamed as the @entity143 of @entity144			0
other blunders have seen the @entity147 rugby team referred to as @entity148 , the sale of millions of puppies - not poppies - in @entity99 on @entity152 , a ' cat 's pornography reading ' disclosed during a court report and a solemn call for silence become ' a moment 's violence ' during the @entity6 's funeral in 2002			2
during one particularly toe - curling moment , many viewers would have been left wondering how a man could have possibly named his 10 - year - old son ' phrase whore ' - only to realise his name was actually ' @entity166 '			0
shocking : a man sees his son @entity166 's name changed to ' phrase whore ' in one particularly toe - curling blunder @entity171 or frost ? the gaffes are not just restricted to @entity53 and sports channels - with one of the broadcaster 's @entity177 presenters previously subtitled as saying : ' they would be a few more mist and @entity171 patches ' and when one @entity14 announcer revealed the @entity185 was ‘ making helpful decisions ’ , deaf members of the audience would have been confused as to why politicians were ‘ making holes for surgeons ’			1
the embarrassing gaffes are not just restricted to the @entity14 's @entity191 channels - with one of the broadcaster 's @entity177 presenters previously subtitled as saying : ' they would be a few more mist and @entity171 patches '			1
and most of the blunders have not gone unnoticed with the public - with celebrities also picking up on the bizarre mistakes			0
not just the @entity14 : @entity199 has previously misquoted star @entity200 as ' engle @entity201 distinct ' blunder : and this morning once accidentally confused the word ' rate ' for ' rape ' during a fashion segment in june last year , dr @entity207 tweeted : ' the typos on @entity53 subtitles are quite funny sometimes			2
today " 500 actors are set to be killed " later corrected to " 500 badgers "			0
phew ! ' however , the @entity14 is not the only broadcaster to have suffered hilarious subtitle gaffes - with 70 channels in the @entity99 now providing a subtitling service			1
@entity199 has previously misquoted @entity217 star @entity200 as ' engle @entity201 distinct ' , while @entity219 once accidentally confused the word ' rate ' for ' rape ' during a fashion segment			0
last year , @entity23 demanded that broadcasters monitor the quality of subtitles , which are used by more than a million people , every six months for two years			1
victims : the @entity14 has previously referred to @entity135 prime minister @entity134 ( left ) as ' mr @entity136 ' , while @entity138 leader @entity137 ( right ) became ' @entity139 ' during one of the broadcaster 's news reports a consultation which started in may suggested that problems began when pre-recorded programmes were delivered to broadcasters too late to allow subtitles to be prepared in advance			1
@entity23 will publish a report based on its findings in spring 2014 , and use the evidence to decide is changes to the current guidelines are needed			0
a @entity14 spokesman said : ' we recognise that subtitling is a hugely important service , and we endeavour to ensure it is as accurate as possible			2
' as with all broadcasters , there are occasions - particularly during live broadcasts - when mistakes inevitably occur , but we do all we can to keep this to a minimum and are constantly striving to deliver a reliable service			2

blunders have aired on broadcaster 's news , @entity259 and *weather* channels
one gaffe sees @entity14 welcome @entity26 viewers into ' year of the whores '
another features news report on pigs that ' nibble anything , even willies '
and footballer @entity74 's name translated as ' @entity274 jazz jam '
seventy *television* channels in the @entity99 now provide a subtitling service
last year , @entity23 demanded that broadcasters monitor quality of subtitles
@entity14 said it strives to keep mistakes ' to minimum ' and ' *improve* accuracy '
