by @entity0 published : 03:04 est , 18 october 2013 updated : 04:12 est , 18 october 2013 @entity3 military operations are at risk of being undermined by the march of @entity7 human rights laws and health and safety red tape into the battlefield , experts have warned			1
enemies could view the courtroom as a new front in any future conflict as a way of ' paralysing ' the armed forces , a report by the @entity13 think tank said today			2
defence secretary @entity21 admitted he was ' concerned ' about recent court judgements which could make it ' more difficult ' to carry out operations			1
' mobile coffins ' : the family of soldiers killed in @entity28 won the legal right to sue the @entity30 for damages in a landmark case			1
they included those killed while patrolling in @entity35 ( pictured ) in a landmark ruling , the @entity36 said in june that the families of soldiers killed in @entity28 could launch claims for damages under negligence and human rights laws			1
lawyers representing relatives said the ruling meant the @entity30 owed a duty of care to properly equip servicemen and women who went to war			1
the government warned the decision could put national security at risk because it opened up war to ' the uncertainty of litigation '			2
an @entity28 man who claims he was abused while being held captive by the @entity56 in @entity57 is among those taking legal action against the government			1
@entity60 , the leader of the radical @entity62 cleric , @entity64 ’s militia , is claiming compensation after ' being denied his rights under the @entity67			2
another @entity28 , @entity68 , is also taking action after @entity3			1
he was arrested travelling from @entity70 to @entity28 in 2003 on suspicion of being a member of a terrorist group involved in weapons smuggling and explosive attacks in @entity28			1
he sued the government citing @entity77 5 of the convention			2
his claim was dismissed by @entity3 's @entity36 but the case was overturned by the @entity81			0
@entity82 , one of the authors of the @entity13 report and a former military assistant to the chief of the defence staff , said : ' over the past decade , legal steps based on the @entity67 have undone safeguards @entity89 drew up to ensure military commanders have the freedom of manoeuvre to make vital decisions on the ground			1
' the armed forces neither are , nor should be , above or exempt from the law			0
but , imposing civilian norms on the military is deeply misplaced ' the focus on rights misunderstands the nature of armed forces			2
as the ultimate guarantors of a nation ’s liberty they have agreed , voluntarily , to surrender or limit many of their own rights			0
without this the nation would be undefended			0
' @entity111 , a retired @entity112 lieutenant colonel and military lawyer , who co-wrote the report , said : ' these judicial incursions into military terrain are not just changing military ethos and long - standing legal principles			0
' they are placing impossible burdens on the bureaucracy of military operations			0
' by setting precedents which can barely be satisfied in today ’s limited conflicts the courts risk paralysing themselves and the military in a war of national survival particularly when to these are added the demands of coroners ’ inquests , health and safety legislation and the rights guaranteed under the @entity67			0
' the paperwork alone would simply overwhelm the @entity30 even if the findings of the eventual inquiries ascribed no blame			0
' ' human rights creep ' : the report authors warned against the march of human rights and the laws of negligence into the battlefield			1
they said that the long - standing principle that military commanders have freedom of action while in action is at risk of being undermined the report said the @entity30 faced 5,827 claims in 2012 - 13 and lawyers cost the cash - strapped ministry £ 36 million a year			1
it claimed : ' it may not be long before either a foreign power or sub-state forces might begin to sponsor legal actions as a way of paralysing the armed forces through legal process			0
' @entity164 , a lawyer with @entity164 , a company which has fought high profile cases against the @entity30 dismissed the report 's findings as ' biased '			1
abuses : the report authors , who warned of the creep of human rights laws into the battlefield , acknowledged abuses have been committed by @entity3 soldiers - including the death of @entity28 detainee @entity178 in 2003 ' this is an entirely biased report which seems to have been written with the full co-operation of the @entity30 ' we were not consulted and neither were our clients			1
had we been , we believe this report would have been far more accurate			0
' the report states that the customs and practices of @entity3 ’s armed forces are now under threat from the law			0
' we would argue that it is the breaking of these laws which is the greatest threat to those who " risk all for their country "			0
' this includes not training or equipping soldiers adequately before putting service personnel into a combat zone			0
' we find it very disconcerting that the government of law and order seem so intent on desecrating the legal system , ignoring the safeguards the law provides for all individuals and continues to act unlawfully through its many departments including the @entity30 ' @entity211 adherence to the laws , both domestic and international , are the only way in which the @entity30 's litigation will decrease			0
' however , mr @entity21 welcomed the report and said : ' i remain concerned about the challenge to combat immunity arising from recent court judgements			2
' these could make it more difficult for our troops to carry out operations in the future , and they potentially throw open a wide range of military decisions to the uncertainty of litigation			1
' it can not be right that troops on operations have to put the @entity67 ahead of what is operationally vital to protect our national security			2

family of soldiers killed in @entity28 were told they can sue in landmark ruling
report says human rights cases restrict freedom of manoeuvre in battle
government ' concerned ' rulings could make carrying out operations harder
lawyers dismiss findings as ' biased ' and say cases are about ensuring troops are properly trained and equipped for battle
