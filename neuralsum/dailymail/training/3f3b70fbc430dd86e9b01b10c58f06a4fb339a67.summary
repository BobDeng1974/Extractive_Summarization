they have been given £ 50 a time to draw up ‘ end - of - life advanced care plans ’ for patients they predict will pass away within a year			1
the payments are designed to encourage doctors to start talking about death with elderly and seriously ill patients and to keep a record of where , ideally , they would like to die			2
those behind the ‘ yellow folder ’ scheme – so named as that is where the care plan forms are kept – insist its main aim is to give patients a better death			1
but critics say it was designed to save money and could result in people being denied treatment or help			0
according to documents seen by @entity38 , a ‘ key objective ’ of the project , trialled in eastern @entity41 , has been ‘ to shift the place of death ’ away from hospitals so ‘ reducing			1

@entity0 have been paid bonuses to put elderly patients on controversial ' death lists ' in an attempt to save the @entity6 money by cutting the number of people who die in hospital			1
picture posed by models ‘ why should a gp be paid for this conversation , as opposed to any other ? ’ she said			2
‘ i feel doctors are paid very well and there should be no extra payments			2
anything else is open to abuse and misuse			0
’ she also feared that patients signing up to die in their own home may unwittingly be ‘ closing the door on potentially life - saving hospital treatment ’			1
she explained : ‘ a doctor may not realise that , while the person appears to be dying , they actually have a reversible condition			0
’ the gp bonus scheme rewarded doctors at 41 practices in @entity92 and @entity93 , who were paid £ 50 for each care home patient they signed up to an end - of - life plan			1
patients were asked to stipulate where they would like to die , whether they wished to be resuscitated , and what drugs they wanted in their final hours			0
ambulance services and out - of - hours doctors ’ services were informed			2
the family doctors were also asked to sign up elderly people living in their own homes , although they were not paid the £ 50 bonus in these cases			1
the ‘ pilot ’ project ran for two years from july 2011 to this september and was deemed ‘ successful ’			0
@entity92 and @entity112 ( @entity111 ) , which ran the scheme , has refused to say how much was paid out in total			2

dr @entity134 , acting chairman of the @entity136 , said : ‘ i think it ’s got everything to do with money , with the cost of a hospital bed being £ 200 a day			1
’ he added there was ‘ a real danger ’ patients might not realise the choice could lead to them not having medical support in their final days			0
a @entity111 spokesman said : ‘ the purpose of the scheme is to improve end - of - life care , not save money			1
any reductions in hospital expenditure are likely to be balanced by alternative community - based services			1
‘ the £ 50 payment to gps was part of a two - year pilot to raise the profile of the scheme among staff			1
the reimbursement reflects the time spent by @entity0 with a patient and their family to achieve a dignified death			2
’ health bosses have been forced into publicising a ‘ big brother ’ database of medical records , after @entity38 highlighted serious concerns over the plan			2
millions of medical notes are to be uploaded from @entity174 surgeries to a national computer database under the scheme , which ministers hope will attract drug firms to the @entity179 to help with their @entity181 bosses insisted it was not necessary to inform the public directly			0
instead , they would rely on doctors telling patients or putting up posters in surgery waiting rooms			0

and two weeks ago prominent @entity226 raised concerns , with mp @entity228 describing the scheme as a ‘ honeypot of data ’ to hackers that was ‘ an enormous threat to privacy and patient trust ’			0
now , @entity51 has bowed to pressure and agreed to send leaflets to all of @entity51 ’s 22 million homes , while it is also setting up an £ 800,000 information line in january			0
patients will then have four weeks to tell their gp surgery if they want to opt out – meaning the actual ‘ data extract ’ has been delayed from this autumn to next spring			0
