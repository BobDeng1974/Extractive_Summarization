the three - page document that has come to light is entitled ‘ @entity15 ’ and is dated august 25 , 1939			2
this early draft of the @entity1 , announcing the outbreak of war , was written at least nine days before @entity8 addressed the nation the document , which was written on august 25 , 1939 - seven days before @entity4 ’s invasion of @entity6 - has come to light after 74 years			1
the typed document , the second draft of the speech , was retained by civil servant @entity25 , who had previously written a first attempt			2
in a pencilled note in the left - hand margin , mr @entity25 criticised the length of some of the sentences in the second draft and hinted that his should be used			0
it would appear his advice was followed - the final speech read to the nation and the @entity37 by the @entity38 on september 3 contained shorter , more concise sentences			0
although the tone remained the same , some of the content was significantly different			0
for instance , it did not mention @entity4 or @entity5 by name but merely ' our enemies ’			1
the early draft accused @entity4 of being a bully that wanted to dominate the world by brute force and stressed that ' we are fighting for the principles of freedom and justice '			1
the address was delivered by @entity8 ( left ) on september 3 , 1939 , after @entity5 's @entity4 had invaded @entity6			1
it was depicted in the 2010 film , @entity1 , which starred @entity11 ( right ) as @entity8 in the @entity60 - winning film , @entity11 's royal character was given little time to prepare for his defining address to the nation but in reality it appears the speech was being readied for him more than a week beforehand			1

dr @entity76 , of @entity77 's , which is selling the speech , said : ‘ this is a fascinating document for a number of reasons			1
‘ it brings to life not just the speech , but a pivotal moment in @entity2 history			2
‘ it was written before @entity6 had been invaded but at a time when it was clear we were moving towards war with @entity4			1
‘ it shows that something was being prepared days in advance of the declaration of war so that the monarch had a speech ready in order to speak to the nation and the @entity37			1
' he added : ‘ you get a sense of the preparations for the speech and the struggle to find the right words to prepare the nation for the terrible fight that lay ahead			0
the three - page second draft , uncovered after 74 years , is to be auctioned by @entity77 's next month ‘ there would have been a group of people writing this speech and @entity25 was one of them			1
‘ he had provided a first draft and was sent this revised version			0
his note in the margin is saying that his original is better than this one and that the wording should be shorter			0
‘ the final version was a lot clearer			0
the sentences were shorter and the structure was simpler and that is what you want for public speaking , especially when the speaker has a speech impediment			0
’ @entity130 , a historian at the @entity131 , said : ‘ when it happened , war was n't out of the blue			2
‘ there had been a number of political crises involving @entity4 going on for over a year before			2
