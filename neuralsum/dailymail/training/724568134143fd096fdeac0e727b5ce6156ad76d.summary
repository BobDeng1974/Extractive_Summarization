@entity0 fear @entity1 will try to poach their top talent after he was confirmed as the new @entity4 manager on tuesday			1
the @entity5 has signed a five - year deal worth up to £ 3.5million a season to replace @entity8 , who was sacked earlier this month			1
@entity1 , who could make @entity0 striker @entity9 a top target , said : ' this is a club with tremendous history and prestige and i am honoured to have been given this opportunity to be its head coach			2
there is an abundance of top - class talent at the club and i look forward to starting work			2
new man in charge : @entity1 has been named as the new manager of @entity4 ' @entity4 have a huge following across the world and i have great admiration for the passion the fans show for this team			2
we are determined to give the supporters the kind of attacking football and success that we are all looking to achieve			0
' @entity1 , 42 , will be asked to coax the best out of record signing @entity37 , the @entity5 who came from @entity39 for £ 30m			1
and he can expect a healthy budget to add to his squad , raising fears at @entity43 's that he could return to recruit their top stars			0
spurs are interested in midfielder @entity46 and striker @entity9 , who is recovering from a knee injury that looks likely to keep him sidelined for the start of the new season but has flourished under @entity1 's tutelage			2
moves for @entity46 and @entity53 look out of reach as they head for @entity55 and @entity56			0
but @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 and @entity61 have all excelled under @entity1			1
tough sell : @entity46 is admired by @entity1 but may prove to be out of reach for @entity4 heading to the @entity63 ? could @entity9 also follow @entity1 to @entity4 ? @entity0 will attempt to stop any flow of talent to @entity4 but agreements restricting a club from signing a player from a rival are complex and could contravene @entity71 regulations			1
the @entity72 formed a close bond with his squad during his 16 months at @entity43 's and the prospect of following him could appeal to some players			0
@entity53 thanked @entity1 on @entity79 , saying : ' great manager , great guy and has helped me a lot			0
wish him all the best			0
' following the boss ? both @entity59 and @entity57 had a good season at @entity0 but @entity1 faced a massive social media backlash from @entity0 supporters			1
the @entity89 chief will bring his trusted aides @entity91 , @entity92 and @entity93 with him to @entity4			1
@entity4 chairman @entity94 said : ' in @entity1 i believe we have a head coach who , with his high energy and attacking football , will embrace the style of play we associate with our club			1
he has a proven ability to develop each player as an individual , while building great team spirit and a winning mentality			0
we have a talented squad that @entity1 is excited to be coaching next season			0

@entity0 players @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 and @entity61 could be on @entity1 's radar
*pochettino* signs £ 3.5m , five - year deal at @entity116
@entity5 will try to get best out of his *compatriot* @entity37
@entity1 will bring @entity91 , @entity92 and @entity93 with him to @entity4
@entity4 chairman @entity94 says @entity1 will ' will embrace the style of play we associate the club '
