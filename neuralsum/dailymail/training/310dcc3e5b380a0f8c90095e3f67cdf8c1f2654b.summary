by @entity0 published : 04:25 est , 17 october 2012 updated : 10:32 est , 17 october 2012 very long legs : this harvestman with a phenomenal foot - long leg span was discovered by a @entity5 researcher exploring caves in @entity7 a daddy longlegs with an incredible foot - long leg span has been discovered - and left scientists baffled as to how to classify it			1
dr @entity12 from the @entity13 in @entity14 , @entity5 , found the collossal harvestman while exploring caves during a trip in @entity7			1
it is one of the largest representatives of the entire order discovered anywhere in the world , but a lack of researchers with expertise in the taxonomy of local wildlife mean it has as yet escaped definition			1
dr @entity12 , an arachnologist , had been visiting the south - east @entity32 nation to film a documentary when he made the discovery			2
' in between takes i collected spiders from the caves in the southern province of @entity40 , ' he said			1
' in one of the caves i discovered a harvestman that was absolutely huge			1
' the leg span of the gigantic male harvestman was more than 33cm ( nearly 1.1ft )			1
that 's just a centimetre shy of the current record leg span for a species from @entity50			2
however , when the time came to sort and label his find @entity54 , who mainly deals with huntsman spiders , found himself stumped			2
harvestmen are arachnids , but they are not spiders			0
even the specialist he consulted , @entity61 from the @entity62 of the @entity63 in @entity64 , @entity65 , could only conclude that it is probably the genus @entity67 in the @entity70 family			0
' it ’s a shame we ca n’t identify such an exceptional discovery correctly , ' dr @entity12 said			0
' we have n’t dealt with these and related genera from @entity76 and neighbouring @entity77 before			0
' specialists are also unavailable due to the fact that descriptive taxonomy is no longer the main focus of research funding			1
' the harvestmen of the @entity70 family can be found in virtually every habitat and they constitute an ecologically very important predator group in the natural food chain			2
once properly classified and investigated , the creatures could serve as an indicator of the ecological state of the natural and cultural scenery			0
these long - legged creatures are also of interest to behavioural scientists and evolutionary biologists			0
for example , during courtship the male presents a nuptial gift to the female to demonstrate his fitness			0
only when the female accepts it do they mate			0
whose a pretty boy then ? attempts to define the arachnid have baffled researchers			0
gaps in the taxonomy of local wildlife mean it could only be classified as probably the genus @entity67 in the @entity70 family dr @entity12 would now like to do a detailed case study of the @entity70 family along with his @entity65 colleague and in collaboration with other scientists in @entity5 , @entity76 and @entity119			1
the term ' daddy longlegs ' can actually refer to three different kinds of creepy crawlies , depending on which part of the world you are in : their findings should then be applicable to other groups and regions			0
' we want to avoid a situation in future where we again lack the experts to classify such unique creatures , ' said dr @entity12			2
meanwhile , @entity7 has turned out to be a veritable land of giants			1
other similarly huge arthropods found in the same region include the @entity7 huntsman spider @entity140 with a leg span of up to 30cm ; the whip scorpion @entity143 magnificus with a span of 26cm ; and the predatory centipede @entity146 longicornis with a total span of almost 40cm			1
all these organisms are more or less closely linked to caves in these karst areas			2
' what mechanisms or factors are responsible for this frequency of gigantism is still unclear ' , said dr @entity12 .			0

huge harvestman found by @entity5 researcher exploring caves in @entity7
specialists unable to classify beast because of gaps in local taxonomy
the same region is home to a range of other *massive* arthropods
