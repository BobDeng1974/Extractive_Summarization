@entity0 last night made an appeal to @entity4 's military and security leaders in an extraordinary attempt to spark a coup against @entity7			1
the prime minister said the future of the country 's army and security forces would be guaranteed were @entity7 's regime to fall			1
he persuaded his @entity15 counterparts – including @entity16 , which has long supported the @entity7 regime – to sign up to a declaration that @entity4 needs a ' transitional government ' that can command the ' mutual consent ' of its people			1
prime minister @entity0 ( fourth from left ) arrives for a group photo with the leaders at the @entity15 , at @entity25 , near @entity26 , in @entity27 outlining a future for the country , a statement said ' public services must be preserved or restored '			1
' this includes the military forces and security services , ' it added			1
diplomats confirmed this was a direct message to the leaders of @entity7 's military and security forces that they would not be swept aside if he is removed			1
@entity44 leaders hope elements of the @entity4 regime who are losing patience with their president may be persuaded to move against him if they believe their future is secured			2
@entity16 president @entity52 , however , refused to agree to an explicit demand that @entity7 should go , and claimed that arming the @entity4 opposition could deliver weapons into the hands of the sort of people who slaughtered drummer @entity59 on the streets of @entity61			1
mr @entity52 also defended @entity16 's supply of arms to the @entity7 regime , saying it was fulfilling ' legal contracts ' made with the ' legal government of @entity4 '			1
in a reference to the ' brutal killing ' of @entity59 in @entity71 last month , the @entity16 president added : ' clearly the [ @entity4 ] opposition is not composed all of this but many of them are exactly the same as the ones who perpetrated the killing in @entity61			1
leaders of the @entity15 meet during a round table session at the summit in @entity26 , @entity27 @entity16 president @entity52 speaks as prime minister @entity0 holds a meeting with @entity15 leaders from left , @entity87 's prime minister @entity86 , @entity89 prime minister @entity0 , @entity90 president @entity86 , @entity91 president @entity86 and @entity93 president @entity92 ' if we equip these people , if we arm them what is going to control and verify who is going to have these weapons , including in @entity99 as well			2
' so we call all our partners , before making this dangerous step , think about it very carefully			0
' mr @entity52 firmly rejected suggestions that the @entity4 talks had pitched him against the other @entity15 nations over his continued support for the regime			2
meanwhile , mr @entity0 , who chaired the @entity15 on @entity25 , @entity27 , backed further away from the prospect of @entity89 supplying arms to rebel groups			0
the prime minister has been warned by senior colleagues that he would be unlikely to win a vote on such a move in the @entity114			0
@entity4 army soldiers take control of the village of @entity118 , some five miles north of the rebel - held city of @entity121 ' nobody wants to see more conflict , nobody wants to see more arms , nobody wants to see more death , ' mr @entity0 said			2
instead , he made an appeal to those around @entity7 who know ' in their hearts ' that he can never again lead a stable country , following two years of conflict and at least 93,000 deaths			2
' clearly in @entity4 there are all sorts of people who desperately want @entity7 to go			1
there are those in the official opposition who have put their lives on the line to achieve that , ' mr @entity0 said			0
' but i suspect there are also many , many others who may have supported him in the past but who know after all that has been done , after all the horrors committed , after the use of chemical weapons , that it is literally unthinkable that someone like this would be able to run a unified and stable @entity4 into the future			0
' it is hoped a transitional governing body will be agreed at a peace conference in @entity160 , which the @entity15 wants to see happen in august or september			0

but @entity16 still disputes the evidence			0
the summit also agreed to almost $ 1.5billion in aid to assist the millions displaced by the conflict			0
mr @entity0 agreed the largest single funding commitment ever made by the @entity89 in response to a humanitarian disaster , as he announced a £ 175million emergency package for the @entity4 crisis , taking @entity89 funding for @entity4 to date to £ 348million .			0
