by @entity0 published : 12:57 est , 15 november 2013 updated : 14:56 est , 15 november 2013 a television wildlife expert who appeared on @entity3 ’s chat show has walked free from court despite being convicted of keeping more than 70 exotic animals in ' unspeakable ' conditions			1
@entity7 , 32 , made regular television appearances and taught schoolchildren across the @entity10 about the rare creatures with his company @entity12 the company , which teaches school children about tropical animals , states on its website that its staff can educate people about how to care for exotic pets			1
when police raided the company ’s headquarters in @entity24 , @entity25 , on january 3 they found 74 tropical creatures starved and crammed in four squalid holding pens			1
the creatures were confiscated by @entity59 officers under the @entity60 after they were found covered in faeces			0
it has since cost the charity more than £ 100,000 to care for the range of bizarre breeds - which also included coatis ( @entity68 aardvarks ) , genets ( @entity70 mongooses ) , snapping turtles , tortoises , snakes , a porcupine , @entity76 hawks , and cotton - top tamarin monkeys			1
@entity7 was convicted of animal cruelty at @entity79 on thursday after pleading guilty to 34 counts of not providing a suitable habitat			2
but a judge refused to jail @entity7 - who still teaches and presents on @entity12 shows - or ban him from working with , or keeping , animals			1
' unspeakable ' : police found monkeys , an armadillo , hawks and other creatures cramped into four pens teacher : @entity7 , 32 , teaches schoolchildren across the @entity10 about the wild animals he keeps at the @entity95 not able to care for them : the judge ordered @entity7 to forfeit seven animals as he can not care for them neglected : this armadillo is curled up in a sty filled with debris such as food packets in the company 's hq instead the tv personality was handed a 12 - week jail term - suspended for two years - and £ 100,000 legal costs			1
deputy district judge @entity108 said conditions at @entity12 had been ' unspeakable ' and admitted the animals had ' suffered a great deal '			1
however , he ruled a ban would be ' going too far ' because @entity7 had made ' tremendous progress ' in refurbishing the facilities			2
the judge ordered @entity7 to forfeit seven animals and imposed a deprivation order which will see a further 36 removed from his possession			1
passing sentence he said : ' he has learnt his lesson			0
' this prosecution has prompted him to wake up			0
adjustments : @entity12 has said they will work with the @entity59 to ensure their enclosures are safe keeping animals : the judge did not ban @entity7 from keeping animals or working with them in the future ' i find if i return these animals to him he may not be able to care for them to the standard that he would want to , so i am not going to return them			1
” @entity7 was ordered to do 200 hours of unpaid work as well as paying legal costs of £ 6,100 , further costs of £ 100 and an £ 80 victim surcharge			2
prosecutor @entity137 - on behalf of the @entity59 - told the court @entity12 ’s website offers parties and educational talks on exotic animals			1
mr @entity137 said : ' the society ’s view is this is a commercial business			0
' the animals are the stock and trade of this business - it ’s open to be seen			0
' @entity3 interviewed @entity7 about the care of tropical animals such as turtles on his show last year @entity153 , defending , said @entity7 had taken steps since the raid to improve the animals ’ accommodation			2
mr @entity153 said the company now employed a veterinary nurse , part - time carer and cleaner and students to help care for the animals			2
he also denied @entity164 , from @entity165 , @entity166 , ran the business purely for financial gain			0
he said : ' if it was just a business he would have fewer animals			0
' @entity171 , who has made regular appearances on @entity173 ’s @entity30 can still be seen on @entity12 ’s @entity175 page appearing at company events			2
one picture , uploaded the same day as the court hearing , shows a young girl holding a parrot in front of @entity7 wearing a t - shirt with the company logo			1
in a statement posted two days after the dawn raid , the company said it was working to improve conditions in its holding pens			2
they said : ' as some of you may already be aware , the @entity59 visited our developing site on 3rd january 2013 at 6.30am , which unfortunately resulted in some of our rescued animals being removed from the site			0
' as we had recently received planning permission to build our new education centre , some of the existing buildings had to be demolished in the process of constructing the new premises			0
some of our animals had been moved from their enclosures to temporary indoor enclosures and the @entity59 have deemed some of these temporary enclosures to be unfit			0
sentence : @entity7 , from the @entity166 , was handed a 12 - month jail term suspended for two years ' we would like to make everyone aware that these enclosures were temporary and it was never our intention to keep animals in them for any prolonged amount of time			1
' however due to the extreme wet weather we have been experiencing which has caused significant problems for us and some animals had been in these enclosures for longer than we had anticipated			0
' we wholeheartedly agree that animal welfare is a priority and will be working with the @entity59 to make sure our temporary enclosures are more suitable for our animals and will keep you all updated when we can			0
' we would like to thank everyone for their support			0
