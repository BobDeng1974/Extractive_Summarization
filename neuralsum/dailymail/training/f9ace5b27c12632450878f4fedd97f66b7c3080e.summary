by @entity0 published : 10:00 est , 3 november 2012 updated : 10:01 est , 3 november 2012 this incredible image shows a the sun adorned with a glittering halo - a rare phenomenon called a ' sun dog '			1
it was taken in the aftermath of @entity8 by @entity11 solar physicist @entity9 in @entity12 , @entity13 two days ago			1
the effect is generated by plate - shaped hexagonal ice crystals in high and cold cirrus clouds or , during very cold weather , by ice crystals called diamond dust drifting in the air at low levels			2
blinding beauty : @entity11 scientist @entity9 captured the incredible phenomenon , believed to be caused by @entity8 science blog @entity24 writes that the extremely rare apparition was ' almost certainly connected to @entity8 '			1
the core of the storm swept well north of @entity13 , but @entity8 ’s outer bands did pass over the area , leaving behind a thin haze of ice crystals			0
@entity11 ’s @entity34 head @entity33 says that he had ' never seen anything quite like it '			2
another onlooker , @entity37 , called it a ' once - in - a - decade event '			0
a sun dog , scientific name parhelion from @entity42 ' beside the sun ' , creates bright spots of light in the sky , often on a luminous ring or halo on either side of the sun sundogs may appear as a colored ball of light to the left or right of the sun and in ice halos			1
they can be seen anywhere in the world and are most dazzling when the sun is low			0
@entity61 : a sundog ( parhelion ) is seen around the sun over the @entity65 island of @entity66 in 2007			0

rare *optical* effect causes a halo of light around the sun
@entity11 scientist took *breathtaking* image after storm that *ravaged* @entity76
