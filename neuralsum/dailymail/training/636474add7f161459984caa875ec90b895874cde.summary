sexual threats and menacing one detainee with a power drill are expected to be among controversial @entity4 torture techniques revealed in a report later today			1
the report will detail interrogation techniques used by @entity4 agents in the wake of 9/11 , including threats to sexually assault one captive with a broomstick , according to sources			1
it also describes how terrorist @entity17 , suspected mastermind of the 2000 bombing of the @entity16 , was threatened with a buzzing power drill			1
the tool was not used on him			0
the @entity20 has increased security at @entity23 facilities across the globe today in preparation for a global backlash at the contents of the report			1
the president has held talks with his predecessor over the report but the contents of the calls are not being disclosed however the @entity44 administration remained committed to publishing the incendiary details , insisting that the torture program ' should never happen again '			1
the report , which took years to produce , charts the history of the @entity4 's ' @entity59 ' program , which president @entity60 authorized after the sept. 11 attacks			1
most of the program was shut down by @entity60 before he left office , while @entity44 outlawed ' enhanced interrogation techniques ' after his inauguration			0
yesterday a government official sparred with journalists over reports claiming that secretary of state @entity33 tried to have the report delayed at the 11th hour			1
@entity20 press secretary @entity30 said that @entity33 ' strongly supports ' the release of the declassified document ' for the same valued - based reasons that the president does '			1
at the same time he declined to extend the administration 's proclaimed zeal for transparency to possible phone calls between the current president and former president @entity60 to discuss the contents of the report			2
@entity30 said any talks that may have taken place between @entity44 and @entity60 would remain private			0
even though the redacted paper will reportedly absolve the former president and his @entity20 of knowledge of the extent of which the @entity4 was allowed terrorism suspects to be tortured in @entity90 and @entity91 in the wake of 9/11 , @entity60 has openly opposed the the release of the document			2
' we ’re fortunate to have men and women who work hard at the @entity4 serving on our behalf , ' he told @entity100 ’s @entity99 during an interview that aired sunday			0
and whatever the report says , if it diminishes their contributions to our country , it is way off base , ' he continued , calling the @entity4 operatives and directors about to be chastised ' really good people '			2
@entity60 has been joined by other @entity113 and members of the intelligence community in calling on the sen. @entity116 , chairwoman of the @entity36 's @entity117 , to bag the truncated version of the still - classified 6,000 page report			2
' i think this is a terrible idea , ' @entity121 chairman @entity120 , a @entity122 @entity113 , told @entity99 on sunday			0
' our foreign partners are telling us this will cause violence and deaths			0
foreign leaders who have approached the government say you do this , it will cause violence and deaths			0
our own intelligence community has assessed that this will cause violence and deaths , ' he said			0
according to a report by @entity139 , @entity33 called @entity116 on friday to voice similar concerns and asked her to keep a lid on the report a little longer			2
after word of @entity33 's call to the @entity148 senator spread like wildfire , @entity144 spokeswoman @entity143 said in a statement that @entity33 ' called his former colleague to discuss the broader implications of the timing of the report 's release because a lot is going on in the world			1
' ' he wanted to make sure that foreign policy implications were being appropriately factored into timing , ' including ' our ongoing efforts against @entity164 and the safety of @entity23 being held hostage around the world , ' she said			1
' that anyone would mischaracterize this call or question reasonable , proper , private discussions raises questions about what they ’re trying to accomplish , ' she added			0
@entity33 allegedly tried to have the report delayed at the 11th hour and ' called his former colleague to discuss the broader implications of the timing of the report 's release because a lot is going on in the world ' asked today about claims that @entity33 tried to get @entity116 to shelf the report , @entity20 spokesman @entity30 pointed reporters to the @entity182 statements and reiterated the administration 's approval of the @entity36 committee 's decision to make public certain sections of classified document			1
' i will allow secretary @entity33 to explain exactly why he made the phone call , ' @entity30 said			0
he later stated that he stated that the legislative branch is constitutionally guaranteed oversight of the executive branch and it is ' free to exercise that oversight authority without inappropriate interference ' from president and his administration			0
at another point he said the @entity20 has ' been candid from the beginning we believe it 's the committee 's decision to determine the appropriate timing for the release of this report			1
' ' the administration has taken the prudent steps to ensure that the proper security precautions are in place ' and has been preparing ' for months now for this report 's eventual release , ' he said today			1
@entity30 refused to tell reporters what precautionary measures had been taken and at which embassies , saying that ' would n't be a wise security strategy , ' but a defense official told @entity100 on monday that more than 6,000 @entity217 deployed abroad had been put on standby			2
pointing out that in his first days in office @entity44 used executive action to put a stop to the harsh interrogation procedures detailed in the report , @entity30 told reporters that the president ' does not believe ' they were ' justified the president 's spokesman said @entity44 believes that regardless of where one comes down in the debate , ' the use of these techniques was not worth it because of the harm that was done between our national values			2
' torture : the report concentrates on the activities of the @entity4 under the @entity60 administration , which also saw the establishment of a detention center at @entity241 which @entity243 suspects continue to be held the @entity44 administration official said that it does n't matter if the torture tactics did ' unearth useful information			2
' ' even if they did , ' he said the president believes ' that it was n't worth it , and it did not enhance the national security of @entity23			1
' @entity116 told the @entity254 in an interview published on sunday that the interrogations undermined ' societal and constitutional values that we are very proud of			0
' ' anybody who reads this is going to never let this happen again , ' she said			0
former cia director @entity262 on sunday pushed back against critics of the agency 's behavior under his direction during the final years of @entity60 's tenure , from 2006 to 2009			0
' to say that we relentlessly over an expanded period of time lied to everyone about a program that was n’t doing any good — that beggars the imagination , ' he said on @entity276 ' @entity277			0
@entity262 and other former @entity4 directors who served under @entity60 have promised to release a report of their own setting the record straight once the @entity36 has published the redacted document that it spent five years making			1
' once the release occurs , we ’ll have things to say and will be making some documents available that bear on the case , ' @entity286 , a former deputy director under both @entity287 and @entity60 told the @entity290 on sunday			0
@entity286 , who also served as acting director of the @entity4 for a short time in 2004 , criticized the @entity36 report and claimed it ' uses information selectively , often distorts to make its points , and as i recall contains no recommendations			1
