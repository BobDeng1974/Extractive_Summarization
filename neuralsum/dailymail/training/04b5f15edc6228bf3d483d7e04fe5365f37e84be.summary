the leader of the @entity2 @entity1 offered the @entity3 a deal over @entity5 yesterday – and made it clear he wants to do business with @entity8 not @entity9			1
@entity11 leader @entity10 said the @entity13 mayor of @entity14 was the kind of @entity16 his party can support , saying : ‘ he ’s the only leading conservative who stands up and says things many @entity11 members agree with			1
’ mr @entity10 told his party ’s annual conference in @entity24 a referendum on @entity2 ’s relationship with the @entity27 is now ‘ inevitable ’			1
@entity11 leader @entity10 is seeking to capitalise on one in four @entity16 voters saying they could twitch to back his party and he said his party , which wants to withdraw from the @entity27 , would be prepared to enter negotiations over electoral tactics with any @entity16 leader who offered the public an in - out nationwide vote			1
he indicated @entity11 may not challenge parties that made a promise ‘ in blood ’ to hold a referendum on @entity2 ’s withdrawal from @entity39			1
mr @entity10 told delegates : ‘ if an opportunity came which meant we could get this country closer to walking through a door marked “ @entity2 independence ” , it would be silly not at least to consider it			1
’ @entity11 has enjoyed a surge in the polls to around 10 per cent , which has seen them pushing the @entity51 into fourth place			2
there are fears among the @entity11 is successfully leeching away supporters			2
mp @entity56 said conservative mps were ‘ concerned ’ about defections , claiming the realities of coalition government were ‘ not something that goes down well with some people ’			1
mr @entity10 continued : ‘ all this talk of a deal with the @entity16 has n’t come from me			1
‘ it has come from members of the @entity16 saying to @entity9 “ look , the @entity51 will look to do a deal with @entity69 , and if @entity11 are on 10 per cent or more in the polls , you must look to do a deal with @entity11 ”			1
’ he denied reports he was offering a deal under which @entity11 would give @entity16 candidates a clear run at the 2015 election in return for a referendum pledge , promising he would not ‘ sell short ’ the party			1
he may not even be willing to accept the promise of a referendum , he added , recalling mr @entity9 ’s ‘ cast - iron guarantee ’ of a national vote on the @entity84 before the 2010 election			2
‘ there are one or two people in politics who make promises and then break them , so i do n’t think a cast - iron guarantee would satisfy @entity11			2
at a minimum , it would have to be written in blood , ’ mr @entity10 said			1
the prime minister has indicated he would give voters a say on a new relationship with @entity39 after the next election			2
but mr @entity10 said this would produce ‘ the wrong referendum ’ , because it would not include the option of the @entity2 leaving altogether			1
he said : ‘ the only way we would even consider a negotiation of any kind at all would be if an absolute promise was made to give this country a full , free and fair referendum , so we could decide whether we remain members of the @entity27 or not			2
’ while @entity11 does not have any mps at @entity109 most experts believe they will perform strongly at the @entity5 elections in 2014 and could even threaten up to 50 @entity16 seats in 2015			1
arriving in @entity24 , i saw my first @entity114 near the railway station			2
he had plum - coloured trews , a blue blazer , a pound brooch on his lapel and balding suede shoes			2
oh , and a splendid pot tummy			2
as the bulldog in @entity125 used to say , ‘ that ’s mah boy ! ’ @entity1 ’s leader @entity10 would later , in an energetic if brief speech , talk about how he had not endured ‘ 20 years of hard work , sacrifice and much mockery ’ only to ‘ sell the party short ’ in a possible deal with the conservatives			1
mr @entity10 spoke without autocue			1
his speech was funny , fiery , commendably free of the usual guff from politicians			2
one of life ’s unbridled tonkers , is our @entity10			1
but his bruised mention of being mocked was interesting			2
why is this party teased ? is it simply because its activists have sometimes tended – if they will permit the gross caricature – to have flapping trousers , wall eyes and a problem keeping their breakfast egg on the fork ? or is it because @entity1 questions the @entity155 consensus ? prophets are always scorned			1
there were no metal detectors on the door			2
@entity161 president @entity160 missed a chance			0
he could easily have swanned in with a giant stinkbomb			0
@entity164 was pretty good but there were none of the normal , smart - suited lobbyists you find at other party conferences , although the @entity170 had set up a trestle table			2
a @entity1 merchandise stall was flogging not terribly special jubilee mugs for £ 19 a go			1
blimey ! nor was there the usual flotsam of protest groups and single - issue campaigners outside the door of the conference , shoutily dispensing leaflets			0
perhaps that ’s because @entity1 is , at heart , still a single - issue campaign itself			1
the day began with a welcome from a @entity188 @entity1 chap who had trouble with the sound system			1
a ‘ wheeeee ! ’ went up from the stalls			0
@entity1 president @entity194 went next			1
his delivery was so comically wooden , i wondered if it was @entity197 under that oiled hairdo			0
mr @entity194 , who referred to the prime minister simply as ‘ @entity9 ’ , said that the lord mayor of @entity24 had been asked to open the conference but the fella had n’t turned up			0
we heard from ‘ the young people ’ – they are cherished like fresh conkers			0
a larky lad with sideburns so long they could have been drainpipes			0
two beaudelicious belles : a blonde who could have been starring in a shampoo ad , and an @entity214 in an amazingly tight skirt			0
well , hel - low			0
an old gent near me smacked his gums			0
former @entity220 disc jockey @entity219 did a turn , as did @entity222			0
he gave us a history lesson and spoke in such a drawl one might have been excused for suspecting he had been at the whisky decanter			0
most unfair , i am sure			0
mind you , when pugnacious @entity229 spoke he said it was the first conference speech he had given when he had not been hungover			0
mr @entity229 , who is standing against @entity231 for the @entity233 police commissionership , proposed giving police the right to debag anyone who in future behaved like @entity16 chief whip @entity238			1
@entity239 , mr @entity229 said that some of the current rules faced by the police were plainly ‘ drafted by a committee of the retarded ’			0
he said coppers should stop driving top - of - the - range @entity246 and start driving humble hyundais			0
under him there would be no more traffic cameras , and any officer who arrested a householder for defending his home against burglars would be immediately put on disciplinary procedure			0
the @entity3 should come to a deal and give mr @entity229 a free run against @entity231			0
a straight contest between those two would be tremendous entertainment			0
average age in the audience was probably a good 65 and most of them were blokes			0
i saw a skull cap , a few tattoos , walking sticks , @entity270 ties , a tartan flat cap and parmesan tinfuls of dandruff			0
mr @entity10 ’s warm - up man was former tv newsreader @entity275			1
oh no , hang on , it was former newspaper proprietor @entity277 , who has just defected to @entity1 from the @entity3			1
golly , he was dull			0
he had been introduced as ‘ a giant of @entity279 ’ but ‘ crashing bore with too much to say for himself ’ might have been more accurate			0
the crowd wanted mr @entity10 , and when he finally wrenched the lectern out of @entity277 ’s hands , he went off like a rocket			1
smaller government , no to @entity39 , no to @entity286 , off with the @entity288 ’s head – a @entity1 conference is in some ways a rightwinger ’s political erotic dream			1
they certainly cement @entity9 in the centre ground			0
the problem is that the activists radiate a quite different culture from that of 21st century ’s media commisars			0
the speeches yesterday were unremittingly , almost exuberantly negative			0
in their logic and drive they have been impressively correct about @entity5 , and possibly much else			0
it ’s just hard to see how voting @entity1 will bring about anything but an @entity307 government of crazed lefties .			1
