by @entity0 published : 04:07 est , 21 june 2013 updated : 20:01 est , 24 june 2013 after first one , and then both , of her older sisters were diagnosed with breast cancer , @entity2 refused to take any chances			1
identical twins @entity8 and @entity10 elected to have double mastectomies to prevent the disease returning , and miss @entity2 bravely resolved to do the same – despite being perfectly healthy			1
but while tests confirmed that her 43 - year - old siblings were carriers of the faulty @entity18 gene which causes breast cancer , it turned out miss @entity2 was not			1
@entity8 ( left ) , @entity10 ( centre ) and @entity2 ( right ) have all had double mastectomies			1
@entity21 ms @entity8 and ms @entity10 , 43 , both carry the brca gene and both developed breast cancer despite that , she says she has no regrets about her surgery			1
in fact , the three sisters believe their ordeals have brought them closer together			0
the 40 - year - old telesales worker said : ‘ i decided i did n’t want my breasts			2
i was offered counselling , but no counselling in the world would have made me change my mind			0
‘ it was the best decision i ever made			0
now i do n’t have to worry			0
i do n’t have to wait for it to happen to me			0
’ there had been no history of breast cancer in the family before mrs @entity8 , a mother of three who runs her own company preparing venues for events , was diagnosed with the disease in 2005			1
after seeing what her sisters had been through , ms @entity2 decided that she should also undergo a double mastectomy			1
she later discovered that she does not carry the faulty gene @entity8 ( left ) had a mastectomy and immediate reconstructive surgery when she was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2005			1
@entity10 ( right ) decided to stagger the operations when she was also diagnosed mrs @entity8 , then 35 , decided to have a double mastectomy at @entity58 in the sisters ’ home town of @entity61 - upon - @entity62 , @entity63 , followed by immediate reconstructive surgery in @entity65			1
five years later , mrs @entity10 , who runs a gardening business with husband @entity67 , was also diagnosed with the disease			2
she was told she would have to have one breast removed because of the size of her tumour , leaving her ‘ devastated ’			2
but after doctors told her she carried the faulty gene , which meant there was an 80 per cent chance of the disease returning , the mother of two asked them to remove the other breast as well			1
she said : ‘ i had helped @entity8 through the tough times and knew that she would do the same for me , and that i would beat the cancer just as she had			2
we were close before and this has just strengthened our sisterhood			0
’ ms @entity8 and ms @entity10 are both now free from the disease and ms @entity2 says she does not regret having the surgery as even without the faulty genes women have a one in eight chance of developing breast cancer a cell needs to have a number of mistakes in its genetic code before it becomes cancerous			1
doctors call these mistakes faults or mutations			0
they can occur due to substances people come into contact with			0
or , they can happen because of mistakes that cells make when copying their genetic code before dividing into two new cells			0
most of these abnormal cells die or are killed off by the immune system			0
it usually takes many years to gather enough genetic mistakes to cause cancer			2
but it is possible to be born with a gene fault that increases the risk of cancer			2
scientists have identified a number of these so - called ' cancer genes '			0
the first genes to be found were @entity18 1 and brca 2 - women with these genes have a 50 to 80 per cent chance of getting breast cancer in their lifetime			1
women who tests positive can either have regular breast screenings or have surgery to remove their breasts ( and possibly ovaries )			0
in between the twins ’ diagnoses , their mother , @entity130 , had a pre-cancerous lump removed , and was found to carry the faulty gene			1
a cousin was also diagnosed with breast cancer			1
by the time mrs @entity10 was diagnosed , miss @entity2 had made up her mind to follow the twins down the surgery route			1
she had the operation in june 2011			0
weeks afterwards she decided to take the blood test too , which established she was not a carrier of the faulty gene			1
miss @entity2 , who is separated from the father of her three children , said : ‘ genetic or not genetic , i did n’t want my breasts			2
‘ the test was irrelevant			0
i had the op before i had the test and it would n’t have made any difference , whatever it had said			0
‘ it was just the fear of it happening to me			0
it was something i always thought about and i ’d been paranoid about it since i was about 25			0
’ the faulty gene can be passed down family lines , increasing the risk of cancer			1
but the absence of it did not mean miss @entity2 would never develop the disease , as it accounts for only a small proportion of cases			2
she said the sisters were speaking out now to publicise a ball they have organised to raise money for @entity58 , where each of them had their operations			0
their younger brother , @entity169 , 32 , who is in the @entity170 , has not been tested for the gene			0
last month , @entity174 actress @entity173 , 38 , revealed she had undergone a pre-emptive double mastectomy after tests confirmed she carried the faulty @entity178 gene			2
it meant she had a 87 per cent chance of contracting breast cancer and a 50 per cent chance of contracting ovarian cancer .			1

twins @entity10 and @entity8 , 43 , both carry the faulty gene
they both developed breast cancer and had double mastectomies
their sister , @entity2 , 40 , was concerned about her risk of the disease
@entity197 also had the operation but later discovered she does not carry the gene
