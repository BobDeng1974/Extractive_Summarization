by @entity0 published : 17:56 est , 17 november 2013 updated : 17:56 est , 17 november 2013 probe : @entity2 's inquiry into union antics has been lambasted by @entity5 directors militant union bosses last night warned their members not to ‘ collaborate ’ with a government inquiry into the use of bully - boy tactics in industrial disputes			1
@entity2 ordered the probe into @entity5 ’s tactic of sending mobs of demonstrators to protest outside the homes of company directors			1
but senior @entity18 voiced concerns , saying they would not allow the review – which they insist will also examine tactics used by some companies – to become an exercise in ‘ union bashing ’			1
@entity5 ’s political director @entity26 described the probe as ‘ nothing more than a @entity30 election stunt which no trade unionist will collaborate with ’			1
her comments suggest that members who assist the inquiry will be seen as collaborators – a loaded term often used to describe those who helped the @entity37 during the war			0
the @entity39 also dismissed the inquiry as ‘ politically driven ’			0
@entity41 , head of employment rights at the union , said : ‘ it is a completely disproportionate response to one or two instances			0
‘ it is really quite disgraceful that the government is pretending that there is a real public interest concern here			0
’ the inquiry was launched after the @entity52 revealed the true nature of the so - called ‘ leverage tactics ’ used by @entity5 during the bitter dispute at the @entity57 oil refinery in @entity58			1
@entity5 targeted the directors of the plant ’s owner @entity60 , staging a demonstration with a giant inflatable rat outside one executive ’s home			1
one director said he had feared for the safety of his wife and his two young children after 30 unite protesters descended on his drive in the school holidays			0
dispute : @entity5 's political director @entity26 has blasted the review as a ' @entity30 election stunt ' unite general secretary @entity76 has always denied any intimidation or bullying on the part of the union			1
but mr @entity2 said a review was needed to examine whether the law needs tightening to prevent intimidation			0
unsure : chief secretary to the treasury @entity84 said he would not back a clampdown cabinet office minister @entity87 said it was right to investigate ‘ quite unpleasant examples of intimidation against fellow workers and against management ’			1
‘ first of all we need to examine the facts and then to see whether the law needs changing , ’ he said			0
the review by @entity97 , a leading industrial relations lawyer , will investigate the issue of ‘ leverage ’ tactics , as well as the impact of such disputes on the critical national infrastructure			0
mr @entity105 will head a three - strong panel , with a representative each from employers and unions			0
he is expected to report back in six months			0
a source close to @entity111 said the @entity18 business secretary had insisted the review also examine ‘ inappropriate behaviour ’ by some companies , including blacklisting suspected troublemakers			1
@entity118 also insisted the review would look at ‘ irresponsible behaviour by the unions and by business			0
’ but chief secretary to the treasury @entity84 was explicit that the @entity18 would not back a clampdown on unions			2
he said : ‘ if there are measured , sensible , prudent reforms that could help to improve the industrial relations landscape yet further , i ’d be up for that			0
what i ’m not up for is a bunch of union - bashing			2
’ however , @entity30 sources said the ‘ main focus ’ of the review would be on the activities of the unions			2
the row over @entity5 ’s behaviour has been acutely embarrassing for @entity140 leader @entity139 , who is heavily reliant on the union ’s cash to keep @entity140 afloat			1
and former @entity57 employee @entity143 is at the centre of a controversy over allegations @entity5 tried to rig the selection of a new candidate for the safe @entity140 seat			2
meanwhile first minister @entity150 yesterday condemned the review as a ‘ foolish and irresponsible ’ political manoeuvre			2
tactics ? a panel will look into groups such as @entity5 , led by @entity76 , and tactics they are accused of using the @entity140 leadership ‘ approved ’ @entity5 ’s political activities in @entity159 , according to a leaked report			1
in a formal response to allegations of vote - rigging in the safe @entity140 seat , @entity5 said the party was ‘ well aware of @entity5 ’s political strategy activities in @entity159 and approved of it ’			1
the union has been accused of signing up people as @entity140 members without their knowledge in a bid to rig the selection of a parliamentary candidate			0
the leaked document reveals that the @entity140 inquiry made a series of devastating findings against @entity5 , including there was ‘ no doubt that members were recruited in an attempt to manipulate party processes ’			1
@entity139 has repeatedly refused to publish the party ’s dossier on the affair			0
@entity5 denies any wrongdoing .			2

@entity26 , @entity5 political director , blasted it as a ' @entity30 election stunt '
senior @entity18 dems also spoke out against the ' union bashing exercise '
but cabinet office minister @entity87 insists the inquiry is necessary
