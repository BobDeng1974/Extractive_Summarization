by @entity0 published : 05:55 est , 17 september 2013 updated : 07:24 est , 17 september 2013 @entity3 designer @entity2 developed @entity2 , pictured , so different features such as the camera or storage can be replaced easily rather than spending hundreds of pounds on a new handset each year , what if you could simply keep your phone but upgrade the camera , replace the display , increase storage and more in just one click ? that 's the idea behind @entity2			1
created by @entity3 designer @entity2 , @entity2 is a customisable smartphone made up of what 's called ' modular elements ' , or blocks , that can be instantly swapped and replaced			1
if a battery dies , for example , a new one can be clipped into place			0
storage can be upgraded or cameras with different lenses an be swapped in and out depending on the occasion			1
@entity2 designed the concept phone as a more environmentally friendly way of recycling smartphones , to prevent the trend of customers replacing handsets on a yearly basis			1
he said : ' every year millions of mobile phones are thrown away because they are broken or obsolete			2
' in most of these cases it is just one part that needs repairing or upgrading and all the other parts work fine			2
' the @entity2 handset is made of separate components that can be ‘ clicked ’ together			1
every component has its own function and they include a @entity47 and @entity48 transmitter , a battery , camera , new display and storage			2
when one of the components breaks , or needs upgrading , it can be replaced with a new one			0
every component has its own function and they include a @entity47 and @entity48 transmitter , a battery , camera , new display and storage			0
when one of the components breaks , or needs upgrading , it can be replaced with a new one the components are called bloks , and they each attach to a universal base that contains all the relevant electric connections			0
they are fixed onto this board using pins , with two screws holding everything in place			0
individual bloks are sold through the @entity80 - similar to an app store , but for hardware @entity2 is a concept at the moment while @entity2 seeks support from hardware partners and potential customers @entity2 claims : ' choosing separate components enables you to personalise your mobile phone to your needs			1
' are you into taking photos ? go for the best camera			0
are you working in the ‘ cloud ’ ? choose less storage			0
no need for a specific function ? go back to basic and choose a top notch battery			0
' the components are called bloks , and they each attach to a base that contains all the relevant electric connections			0
they are fixed onto this board using pins , with two screws holding everything in place			0
after a customer buys the @entity2 base , individual bloks are sold through the @entity80 - similar to an app store , but for hardware			1
although @entity2 admits that @entity2 would n't solve the problem of electronic waste and pollution , because the bloks would still need to be thrown away , it is a more cost - effective and environmentally - friendly alternative			1
@entity2 is n't available to buy yet , and @entity2 claims that the concept will only be sold if there is a significant interest from customers , as well as hardware partners			2
even the display on the @entity2 handset , pictured , can be replaced			2
@entity2 designed the concept phone as a more environmentally friendly way of recycling smartphones , to prevent the current trend of replacing handsets almost yearly			1

@entity2 is a customisable phone that comes with *detachable* parts
it lets owners replace broken features such as batteries or upgrade storage
users can also *regularly* swap cameras to add different lenses , for example
design *dubbed* an environmentally friendly alternative to smartphones
