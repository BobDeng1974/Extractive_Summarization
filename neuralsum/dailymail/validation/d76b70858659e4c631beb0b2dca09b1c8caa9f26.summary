wardens at @entity8 ( pictured here collecting flowers laid by well - wishers following the death of @entity22 ) claim they receive poor salaries and perform extra duties for visitors for no additional money @entity26 ’ main duties are to meet and greet visitors , tell them about the history of the @entity8 , and hand out free audio guides			1
but @entity30 ( @entity14 ) said many are asked to go above and beyond this for no extra pay , including leading paid - for guided tours at the @entity8			1
other workers administer first aid or speak to tourists in a foreign language without being paid extra , they said			1
now , the @entity14 says workers could adopt ‘ work to rule ’ – industrial action where workers do no more than the minimum required by their contract – unless they receive a pay hike			1
they said wardens were on as little as £ 7.70 an hour , or £ 14,400 a year for a 36 - hour week			0
this is below the @entity50 , a voluntary threshold for employers which rose to £ 7.85 in november , but significantly above the minimum wage of £ 6.50 an hour			1
@entity8 said wages will rise to the new @entity50 in april , but the pcs argue this should have happened last november			1
a spokesman for @entity14 said : ‘ workers are being paid really poor wages despite working for the country ’s richest family			2
@entity8 ( pictured ) said wages will rise to the new @entity50 in april , but the pcs argue this should have happened last november ‘ a large proportion of staff have chosen to work at the @entity8 because they feel they are working the @entity64 and for the @entity65			1
‘ their employers should not take advantage of that and abuse their goodwill by not properly rewarding them			0
’ the wardens work for the @entity73 , a charity which presides over one of the world ’s largest and most important works of art , jewels and artefacts			2
the @entity14 said the @entity64 and @entity65 should not ' abuse the ( workers ' ) goodwill by not properly rewarding them ' it is held in trust by the sovereign on behalf of the nation , and workers for the collection are therefore employees of the @entity2			0
forty wardens out of 200 workers at @entity8 have been balloted on whether they want to take industrial action			0
while the union has ruled out a strike , staff may refuse to work overtime and conduct guided tours and insist on taking their full lunch breaks			2
if wardens vote for this , it would be the first time staff have ever done so over working conditions specific to a @entity2 , the @entity14 said			0
a spokeswoman for the @entity73 said workers undertook extra roles voluntarily and were under no obligation to do so			2
she said : ‘ warden staff are offered voluntary opportunities to receive training and develop skills to lead guided tours for visitors as part of their working day and to administer first aid , as well as to use their language skills			1
‘ these are not compulsory aspects of their role , and it is the choice of the individual whether they wish to take part			0
’ they said staff received a range of benefits including a 15 per cent non-contributory pension and a free lunch			0
she added : ‘ @entity73 continues to award wardens an annual performance - related pay increase of up to 2.5 per cent , in addition to the cost of living increase , as well as one - off payments to those who have reached the top of their pay scale			2
’ the @entity139 said it did not anticipate any interruption to tours in the event of industrial action			0
the @entity139 website says its wardens enhance visitors ’ experiences by ‘ interpreting the exhibits , buildings and works of art whilst maintaining visitors ’ safety and security ’			0
it says : ‘ whether you are greeting visitors at the start of their tour , carrying out security and baggage checks , or answering questions along the visitor route , you will be part of an impressive and unique experience			0
