security : the duchess with a protection officer security around the @entity1 appeared to have been stepped up as she was guarded by taser - wielding personal protection officers			1
her @entity6 bodyguards , including those in plain clothes , were seen wearing the controversial stun guns for the first time in addition to the conventional firearms they usually carry			1
the officers were also thought to be wearing stab vests			1
onlookers noted that there appeared to be more back - up officers and police outriders accompanying @entity1 than normal			2
with the level of threat from international terrorism in the @entity24 classed as severe , it is clear that the @entity25 are taking no chances with the six - month pregnant duchess and other senior members of the @entity29			1
there had already been high - level talks about issuing members of the @entity33 with @entity34 following a series of security alerts			0
these included an attack by a mob on a car carrying prince @entity41 and the @entity42 during the @entity44 riots in 2010 , which saw the window of the @entity46 smashed and @entity47 poked with a stick			1
until recently @entity34 had only been used by officers guarding royal premises or on ‘ mobile patrol ’			2
but a new directive recommended that firearms officers should also be given ‘ less lethal weapons ’			2
armed : a bodyguard , in plain clothes , was armed with a taser as he guarded the @entity1 in north @entity44 precaution : the £ 750 @entity58 , pictured left , was being carried by officers as well as pistols , pictured right the stun guns were first introduced in a very limited way to police forces in 2003			1
guidelines say the weapon can be used only when officers face violence or a threat of violence so severe that they need to use force to protect themselves			1
tasers fire a dart which can deliver an electric charge of 50,000 volts , rendering a suspect helpless for at least 20 seconds			2
they have a range of 21ft			0
under the 1968 @entity80 , the stun guns are considered dangerous enough to be classed as ‘ prohibited weapons ’			2
civilians caught in possession of one can be punished by up to ten years in prison			0
the use of @entity34 by police has been condemned by human rights groups who argue that the devices cause intolerable suffering and even death			0
police wearing the £ 750 @entity34 were spotted in the run - up to the @entity93 in 2012			0
but yesterday was the first time officers guarding the @entity1 have been seen wearing them clipped on their belts in ‘ quick - draw ’ holsters			1
@entity1 , who is expecting her second child in april , was visiting an event held by the @entity99 in @entity100 , @entity44			2
working mother : @entity102 of @entity103 , who is six months pregnant , seemed unfazed by the increased security she sported a £ 169 brown silk dress by high street store @entity106 , which is not designed for maternity use			1
it is the third time she has worn the outfit in public			0
at a tea party to meet children who have benefited from fostering , the duchess seemed taken by a rosy - cheeked six - month - old called @entity116 whom she called ‘ sweetie pie ’ and compared to her own 18 - month - old son , saying : ‘ she ’s chubbier than @entity120			0
’ royal welcome : @entity1 happily shock hands and chatted with the crowds as she met foster carers in @entity100 , north @entity44 ‘ it ’s really so fantastic what you are all doing , supporting all these kids and giving them these opportunities			1
well done , ’ she added			0
@entity1 said she was keen to learn more about the work of foster parents who provide homes for vulnerable children and young people			0
she has no official link with the organisation but it is hoped that she might forge one in future			0
high alert : issuing members of the @entity141 , who already carry conventional firearms , pictured left , with @entity34 , pictured right , followed a series of security alerts watchful eye : @entity102 of @entity103 's plain clothed bodyguard kept a close eye on her during her visit the duchess met carers and social workers before a more informal reception yesterday to hear more about what fostering involves			1
more than 63,000 children are currently being fostered in @entity24 , many of whom have experienced neglect and abuse , or have witnessed domestic violence or substance misuse			0
but at least 8,600 new foster families are desperately needed , particularly those who can offer a home to teenagers , disabled children and groups of brothers and sisters .			0
