by @entity0 former vice president @entity2 's wife @entity1 has theorized that @entity3 has come out with her story this early in the 2016 presidential calendar so that @entity7 wo n't have to deal with it when she announces her presumed candidacy			1
' i really wonder if this is n’t an effort on the @entity15 ' part to get that story out of the way , ' @entity10 said during a tuesday night interview on @entity19			1
@entity7 has not formally launched her campaign but she is widely assumed to be the @entity42 frontrunner for the presidency and has been taking part in a speaking tour while finishing her latest book - both of which serve as signs towards an expected run			1
according to mrs @entity10 , who is also promoting her own book , this latest possible hiccup into the scandal seems perfectly timed before it could really inflict too much harm			0
' getting it out of the way so we can say one more time it 's old news seems to be like a strategy or a tactic , perhaps , ' mrs @entity10 said			2
mrs @entity10 posed her theory during an appearance on @entity64 , which was being hosted by substitute @entity65 on tuesday night			0
part of the plan : @entity2 argues that what may seem like a problem for @entity70 now - the essay - is a way of addressing the cheating scandal in the easiest way possible ms @entity65 loved the theory - saying that she was ' really mad i did n't think of it first ' - but other @entity77 are wary of wading too deep into the @entity79 issue like they first did during the impeachment hearings in 1998			1
the initial scandal coincided with the midterm elections , and while the @entity77 focused on their liberal opponent 's moral misgivings , they did n't end up winning back the @entity34			1
' this is the same trick the @entity15 pulled on us back in ‘ 98 , ' conservative strategist @entity87 told @entity88			2
' we did n’t campaign against the massive overspending , or anything else			0
we were distracted by this bright , shiny object they handed out which was @entity3			2
' it will be the same thing this time : " pay no attention to the reset of foreign policy with @entity99 , or @entity100			0
oh look , it ’s @entity7 the victim ! " ' ' it ’s a constant challenge , but it ’s like in baseball : if they throw out a bad pitch and you swing at it , then you ’re an idiot			2
' one @entity77 who initiated the ' @entity79 ' talk even before the @entity20 article was announced was senator @entity113 , who called the former president a ' sexual predator ' earlier this year and brought up the affair in the context of the @entity42 ' claims that @entity77 's launched a ' war on women '			1
focus on the past : @entity77 strategists have cautioned politicians from making too much of the 1998 scandal between then - president @entity70 and his former intern because it will not help them at the polls the full version of @entity3 's tell - all essay has been released and she accurately predicted how conservative political pundits would read into the timing of her re-emergence			1
' despite what some headlines will falsely report about this piece , this is not about me versus the @entity15			2
their lives have moved on ; they occupy important and powerful places on the global stage			0
i wish them no ill will , ' she writes in the latest issue of @entity20			1
' when i hear of @entity7 's prospective candidacy , i can not help but fear the next wave of paparazzi , the next wave of ' where is she now ? ' stories , the next reference to me in @entity19 's coverage of the primaries			1
i 've begun to find it debilitating to plot out the cycle of my life , to some degree , on the political calendar			0
' as a counter point to the point she expected conservatives - like mrs @entity10 - would make , @entity3 described her decision to write the essay as a matter of her no longer wanting to put her life on hold			1
' being a conscientious @entity168 - and aware that i could be used as a tool for the left or the right - i have remained silent for 10 years , ' she writes in the @entity20 article			1
she also notes that the scandal and her ensuing notoriety has had clear repercussions in her personal life , as her friends have gone off to get married and have children , while she regularly gets rejected from job opportunities and decided to flee to @entity180 to get her master 's in social psychology at the @entity183			2
@entity3 explained that she took great care to cause as few problems for mrs @entity7 as possible when she first ran for president in 2008 , but has had a change of heart when it comes to this next , expected run			1
' i remained virtually reclusive , despite being inundated with press requests , ' she said of the 2008 campaign			0
coming back out : @entity3 accurately predicted that her decision to speak out would be interpreted as having a role in the 2016 presidential primaries ( pictured in @entity194 in 2013 ) ' i put off announcing several media projects in 2012 until after the election			1
( they were subsequently canceled — and , no , i was n’t offered $ 12million for a salacious tell - all book , contrary to press reports			0
) ' and recently i ’ve found myself gun - shy yet again , fearful of ‘ becoming an issue ’ should she decide to ramp up her campaign			0
but should i put my life on hold for another 8 to 10 years ? ' she revealed that the decade - long silence has come at a cost , as she turned down offers that would 've amounted to $ 10million because she ' did n't feel like the right thing to do '			0
' it ’s time to burn the beret and bury the blue dress , ' she said , poking fun at the infamous ' 90s attire that she is so closely associated with			0
' sure , my boss took advantage of me , but i will always remain firm on this point : it was a consensual relationship			0
any ‘ abuse ’ came in the aftermath , when i was made a scapegoat in order to protect his powerful position , ' she wrote in the essay			0
' the @entity70 administration , the special prosecutor ’s minions , the political operatives on both sides of the aisle , and the media were able to brand me			1
and that brand stuck , in part because it was imbued with power			0
' @entity235 secretly recorded her colleague , @entity3 , when she revealed her affair with the president @entity235 : @entity239 worked at the @entity240 and became close with @entity3 after the then 23 - year - old intern was transferred from the @entity34 in 1996			1
@entity3 revealed the sexual affair with @entity70 and , on the advice of @entity244 , @entity239 began recording their conversations			1
she turned those more than 20 hours of tapes over to @entity248 in exchange for immunity			0
she was also the one to convince @entity3 not to have a blue dress dry cleaned because it had the president 's semen stain on it , arguing that it was the young intern 's ' ultimate protection ' if prosecutors would come after her			1
@entity239 was later charged with illegally recording @entity3 but those charges were dripped			2
she was fired from her @entity240 job on the last day of the @entity70 administration in 2001 and received a $ 595,000 payout from the government because she successfully argued that she was not granted a promotion due to her involvement in the scandal and other related charges			2
her most recent update came in 2003 during an appearance on @entity270 's talk show where she revealed she had breast cancer			0
she is last believed to have moved to @entity272 with her @entity274 architect husband			0
@entity244 : @entity275 convinced @entity239 to record the @entity3 conversations the book publisher played a pivotal role in the @entity3 scandal by becoming close with @entity235 and advising her to tape her conversations with @entity3			2
@entity244 was the one who told @entity239 that @entity282 - where she was based - had one - party consent laws which would make it legal for @entity239 to record @entity3 without her knowledge			2
( that was not actually the case			0
) she also urged @entity239 to both hand over the tapes to special prosecutor @entity248 and to @entity291 reporter @entity290			0
aftr the scandal died down , she began writing for right - leaning websites and hosting her own radio show though that is no longer nationally syndicated			2
@entity248 : @entity248 was the independent counsel who led the investigation appointed as the @entity297 at the start of the @entity70 administration in 1994 , @entity248 had a leading role in the investigations of a number of scandals but the @entity3 affair was by far the most infamous			1
@entity305 , a former employee from @entity306 , was suing the president over an alleged sexual assault when he asked @entity70 about his relationship with @entity3 for the first time			1
in that deposition , @entity70 denied having ' sexual relations ' with the intern , and @entity248 then used the semen - stained dress and hours of surreptitiously obtained @entity248 recordings to charge the president with perjury			1
@entity248 gained worldwide recognition for his role in the scandal and shared the @entity323 ’ title with @entity70 in 1998			1
he resigned as independent counsel the next year and went into academics , first teaching law at @entity327 and @entity328 before being named the dean of the law school at @entity331 in 2004			0
he went on to continue work as a lawyer and notably represented @entity70 fundraiser @entity334 in his 2007 statutory rape case			0
he was named the president of @entity338 in 2010 and continues to hold that position .			0
