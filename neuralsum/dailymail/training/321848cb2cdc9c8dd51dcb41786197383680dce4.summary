a toddler has been caught on camera at a @entity3 zoo , seemingly oblivious to the desperate efforts of one of its residents to make a meal out of him			1
the little boy brought to the lion enclosure at @entity12 zoo is a tantalizing thought for this lioness who keeps on enthusiastically tapping away at the reinforced glass that separates the two of them			1
@entity20 , as she is known , is one of four lions who live at the zoo , making it her home since 2010			1
often she can be seen interacting with children			0
the video was posted onto the internet showing the extraordinary encounter between a big animal and the youngster			0
what a tease : the toddler appears to be completely unfazed by this hungry lioness			2
sometimes lions and cheetah will spend several minutes playing with wildebeest calves or gazelle fawns before finally chomping them the space between : the video shows a lioness at the zoo clawing at the glass and trying to get its jaws around a toddler 's head , all while only inches from the child 's face the lioness apparently does this with kids quite a bit ; she loves children , but it 's probably a good thing that the glass is very thick ! the child does n't appear to be all that bothered by the interaction between himself and the jungle beast			1
the lioness is persistent yet the toddler is unperturbed			2
at the zoo they tell customers not to feed the animals - something that this little kid would heartily agree with			2
just saying hi ? at zoos , lions may be provoked by children more often than adults just because they ’re lower to the ground tasty : lions like to bite their prey around the neck or head			0
because of how most zoos are constructed — children ’s heads tend to be right at the lion ’s eye level attempting to explain why there are a number of videos of lions ' playing ' with children , @entity86 of the @entity87 at the @entity88 notes that while ' some of the lions look quite playful in their attempts … sometimes the animals will spend several minutes playing with wildebeest calves or gazelle fawns before finally chomping them			0
' he added that ' predators generally treat calves / fawns / babies differently from adults because they are such easy prey ; there 's no real chance of escape , so what 's the hurry ? '			0

@entity20 , a 7 - year - old @entity114 lioness , was captured on camera as she pawed at the glass of her enclosure trying to reach a baby on the other side
she is one of four lions who live at the zoo in @entity12 , @entity3 , making it her home since 2010
the zoo *reminds* *viewers* that the glass is very thick , keeping the baby well out of harms way
