police in the @entity1 have revealed their latest crack team of recruits , brought in to deal with the ever - growing threat of drugs and explosive devices			2
the new crew - an adorable brood of puppies - will be trained to bring down some of @entity11 's toughest criminals by sniffing out danger ahead of officers			1
the seven - week - old @entity15 cross puppies , known as @entity16 , are the first to be born into the @entity0 's dog breeding programme , based in @entity18 , @entity19			1
officers are now looking for members of the public to adopt them until they are 12 months old			0
after a year they will then be trained for eight weeks to become specialist search dogs or sniffer dogs - hunting out explosives and drugs			1
yesterday , @entity43 , breed scheme manager at the force 's dog unit , said : ' all the pups are doing really well - they 're healthy and @entity47 is a fantastic first - time mum			0
' what we 're trying to achieve in breeding @entity16 is to bring out certain temperaments in each of the breeds			0
new recruit : the puppy is one of six @entity15 cross pups , known as @entity16 , that will be trained by @entity0 adorable : police are looking for members of the public to adopt them until they are 12 months old ' our @entity60 tend to be a little bit gamey , meaning they like to chase birds , but the @entity63 can be quite responsive so we 're hoping we can create the ideal search dogs by combining the two			1
' we 've had @entity65 donated to us before and the ones we 've got work very well and have a great nose on them			0
' puppy walkers are said to be vital to the training school as they help orientate the dogs for the next 12 months allowing them to experience living in a home , socialising with people and other animals			2
criminals beware : the puppies , three girls and three boys , were born on august 19 in @entity19 training : when they are one year old they will be trained for eight weeks to become specialist search dogs or sniffer dogs mr @entity43 added : ' after their time with the puppy walkers , they 'll go on an eight - week course to develop their search instincts			1
' they 'll complete searches in buildings , streets , open spaces and vehicles with a view to becoming either a drugs sniffer dog or specialist search dog , depending on what they show an aptitude for			0
' but for now , it 's important they 're just allowed to be pups and have fun developing in a happy environment , without any fears			0
just born : the six cute puppies feed from their mother shortly after their birth new colleagues : @entity0 officers proudly show off their latest canine recruits ' anyone over 18 , who would normally be at home during the day to look after the pups can apply			1
' we 're also looking for puppy walkers as we 're quite low on numbers at the moment and could really do with some more volunteers			0
