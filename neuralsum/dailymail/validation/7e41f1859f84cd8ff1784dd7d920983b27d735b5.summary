pregnant women have been warned that a type of antibiotic could harm their unborn baby			0
researchers from @entity5 and @entity6 have linked erythromycin pills with epilepsy and cerebral palsy			0
the study tracked the health of babies born to 200,000 @entity14 women			0
overall , the babies born to women who took antibiotics were no more likely to develop epilepsy or cerebral palsy			0
woman have been warned the common antibiotic erythromycin could harm their unborn baby ( file photo ) but women treated with erythromycin and other pills from the macrolide family of antibiotics were almost twice as likely to have a baby with one of these conditions as those given penicillin			1
the study , published in the journal @entity33 , found that a third of expectant mothers were given antibiotics during pregnancy , most commonly penicillin			1
just 7 per cent of the women prescribed antibiotics were given macrolides , which are used to treat urinary and chest infections and are particularly likely to be given during recurrent illness or if a woman is allergic to penicillin			1
however out of every 150 women given a macrolide rather than penicillin , there was one more baby born with cerebral palsy or epilepsy			0
researcher professor @entity52 advised pregnant women to keep taking any antibiotics that they are prescribed – as an infection is likely to harm their baby			2
@entity56 are from the macrolide family of antibiotics			1
macrolides are used to treat urinary and chest infections and are particularly likely to be given during recurrent illness or if a woman is allergic to penicillin			1
and she stressed that any increased risk to the unborn child posed by the pills would be extremely small			1
however , with four previous studies raising concerns about the pills , she said it was time for the pills to be thoroughly reviewed by the @entity69 ( @entity69 )			0
professor @entity70 , of @entity71 , warned that a bad infection could end up killing both the mother and her child			0
but he added : ‘ nevertheless , drug treatment in pregnancy requires a very high level of safety and it will not surprise me if the regulatory authorities advise doctors to avoid or severely restrict macrolides in pregnancy ’			2
others said that the study does not prove that macrolides are harmful , as it could be that the bugs they are used treat are more likely to damage the brain than other infections			2
@entity56 is used to treat urinary and chest infections and are particularly likely to be given during recurrent illness or if a woman is allergic to penicillin dr @entity95 , of @entity96 , said : ‘ one thing is for sure : pregnant women should definitely take antibiotics when prescribed them as the risk of untreated infection to the pregnancy can be catastrophic			1
‘ to put things in context , the extra risk to their baby of being prescribed macrolides , if indeed there is a risk , is very tiny			2
’ the medicines ’ watchdog , the @entity69 , said it has already sought independent advice on the study and it does not consider that the research provides proper proof that macrolides are dangerous			0
a spokesman said : ‘ importantly , this study found no overall evidence of harm when antibiotics are prescribed in pregnancy			1
‘ any pregnant woman who has been prescribed antibiotics should continue to take them as instructed and speak to their healthcare professional if they have any questions			0

@entity56 is an antibiotic given for urinary and chest infections
is prescribed during recurrent illness or for *people* allergic to penicillin
researchers called for a safety review but stressed increased risk is small
overall , study found antibiotics taken during pregnancy were safe
