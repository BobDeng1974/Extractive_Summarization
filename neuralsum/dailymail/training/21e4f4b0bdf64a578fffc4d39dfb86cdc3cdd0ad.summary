by @entity0 last updated at 2:33 pm on 21st december 2011 @entity1 is reportedly in talks with senior television figures about its @entity1 @entity5 product - an voice - controlled all - in - one flatscreen that was the brainchild of late ceo @entity8			2
but the release of @entity5 has prompted a lot of top tv makers to start looking into the idea of voice - control - with or without linguistic skills to match @entity1 's @entity16 voice assistant			2
@entity17 is leading the charge - with a new voice - enabled version of its ' @entity22 ' gesture - controlled remote			0
the product should be on show at the @entity26 in @entity27 in january - alongside a lot of other @entity5 wannabes , analysts predict			0
the new ' @entity22 ' voice remote will let users speak to control their televisions - a microphone and voice - recognition software built into the remote make your voice work like an internet search ' the new @entity38 will make it easier for users to approach @entity41 - particularly our @entity43 function which now has over 1,000 apps , ' said @entity46 , president of @entity17			1
' talking ' to the remote works like an internet search term - so it 's ideal for finding shows quickly rather than browsing through a whole tv channel			1
rumours flew that @entity1 itself would unveil @entity5 in january - either at @entity26 or to coincide with it ( which seems more likely given the electronics giant 's usual reluctance to appear )			0
@entity17 at the @entity26 in @entity56 : insiders expect several companies to unveil rivals to @entity1 's voice - controlled tv in january next year analyst @entity60 at @entity61 predicted that the imminent launch of @entity5 would have rivals ' scrambling ' and reluctant to be caught ' flat - footed			1
' so far , @entity17 is the only manufacturer to have let details of its version slip - but many tech insiders suspect that voice control may be as ubiquitous at @entity26 this year as @entity68 has been in previous years .			0

speaking works like a ' search ' function for shows
also controls ' apps ' - such as web - tv - built into the tv
other rivals will be ' scrambling ' to beat @entity1 - analyst
