by @entity0 last updated at 1:37 am on 3rd december 2011 @entity1 , the billionaire sex offender friend of the @entity2 , has suffered a major setback in his attempts to rehabilitate his shattered reputation			1
an appeal court in @entity7 has ruled that he must register in the state as the highest and most dangerous level of sex offender			0
the money manager ’s links with prince @entity2 came out just a few months before the latter stepped down in july as a @entity15 trade envoy following a series of scandals			0
prince @entity2 , left , was among the many celebrity friends who backed billionaire @entity1 , right , after he was convicted of soliciting a girl for underage sex the prince was among a string of celebrity friends who rallied around @entity1 by visiting his @entity24 home after he was released from a @entity26 prison where he has served 13 months for soliciting a 14 - year - old for prostitution			1
at the same time , @entity1 and his army of high - powered lawyers were fighting to lower his sex offender status			1
@entity1 even told reporters his offence would not even be considered a crime in @entity7 and compared it to ' stealing a bagel '			1
but a @entity7 appeal court has disagreed , ruling that he remains at ' high risk ' to repeat his offence and poses a ' threat to public safety '			0
although @entity1 , 58 , only admitted to one count of sex crimes , he was allowed to settle more than two dozen civil claims by other teenage girls who said they were paid for sex or sexually - charged massages at his @entity48 mansion			2
@entity49 was one of at least 17 women who settled lawsuits with @entity1 in 2005 over the scandal the girls have been unable to discuss their cases as part of payout deals that are believed to have cost @entity1 millions of dollars			2
but the @entity7 court noted there was ' clear and convincing evidence ' that he committed offences against the other girls			0
police who handled the @entity1 case have suggested he got off too lightly and the @entity7 court ’s judgement appeared to agree , describing @entity26 ’s treatment of the financier as ' unclear '			1
as a @entity72 offender , @entity1 will have to spend the rest of his life informing police of his whereabouts and internet activities			1
he must report to a local police station every year to have his photo taken and verify his address every 90 days with law enforcers			0
@entity1 will even have to tell police what email addresses and web search engines he uses			1
he can move to other states or countries but must notify the local police and will be subject to local laws on sex offenders			0
@entity1 moves between homes in @entity48 , @entity24 , @entity91 , @entity92 and the @entity93			2
he will have to register as a sex offender in each place			0
@entity1 ’s failure to downgrade his sexual offender status is hardly likely to encourage his many famous friends to want to be seen with him			1
prince @entity2 stayed with him at his @entity7 mansion in february , just a month after he was released from prison , and the pair were photographed walking together in @entity102			0
palace officials are understood to be worried about the prince ’s relationship with @entity1 with lawyers for some of his alleged victims pushing for new criminal charges to be brought against him .			2
