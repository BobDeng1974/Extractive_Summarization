by @entity0 mother and daughter : @entity3 , of @entity4 , @entity5 , 38 , gave a kidney to @entity7 , two a mother has saved the life of her two - year - old daughter by giving her a kidney			1
@entity12 , of @entity4 , @entity5 , was born without functioning kidneys - and her parents thought they would not see her grow up			1
but then her mother @entity15 was told a transplant was possible - and she was the ideal donor			1
the 38 - year - old mother - of - four said : ‘ donating a kidney did n't seem like a sacrifice to me - it was just something i needed to do			1
i feel privileged to be able to give her a new lease of life			2
’ both mrs @entity3 and her husband @entity26 , 40 , were tested - and she was found to be a match			1
mrs @entity3 and @entity7 had surgery at different hospitals , while mr @entity30 faced an anxious wait			2
at a 30 - week scan when mrs @entity3 was pregnant , she and mr @entity30 , a retail manager at the @entity32 , were told there was only a 50/50 chance their baby would survive			1
when @entity38 was born in may 2011 , mrs @entity3 hardly had time to cradle her newborn in her arms before worried doctors whisked her away			1
@entity38 was immediately taken into @entity5 's @entity43 's @entity42			1
her parents were told she had end - stage kidney failure and that their newborn needed an operation			1
at home with the @entity30 family : from left , @entity50 , 12 , @entity51 , 14 , @entity15 , 38 , @entity38 , two , @entity52 , eight , and @entity26 , 40 intensive care : when @entity38 was born in may 2011 , mrs @entity3 hardly had time to cradle her newborn in her arms before worried doctors whisked her away at just three days old , baby @entity38 was taken into surgery as she was too small for regular dialysis - and her parents prepared for the worst			1
the operation was a success , but the catheter they inserted became infected , so had to be taken out to let @entity38 heal - and they were told she might die			1
but the family was lucky as hospital had a rare baby dialysis machine from a retired consultant , which saved @entity38 's life			1
at seven months old @entity38 was finally well enough to go home , but still had to go to hospital three times a week for dialysis			1
mr and mrs @entity3 had to juggle taking their sons @entity51 , 14 , @entity50 , 12 , and @entity52 , eight , to school , with @entity38 's five - hour dialysis sessions			2
mrs @entity3 said : ‘ a typical day for us was to take the boys to school , go to hospital for five hours , then go and pick them up again			0
the boys have been amazing and absolutely dote on her			0
’ worry : her parents were told she had end stage kidney failure and that their newborn needed an operation first steps : now @entity38 is a happy , healthy two - year - old and should go on to live a normal life this continued for two years until @entity38 was big enough , at 22lbs , for a transplant			1
end - stage kidney failure , also known as established renal failure ( @entity90 ) , is a very severe stage of chronic kidney disease - when the usual functions of the kidney stop working			2
the kidneys are meant to filter waste products from the blood and then turn them into urine			2
they also help maintain blood pressure and the correct levels of chemicals in the body			0
long - term dialysis - a method replicating many of the kidney 's functions - is necessary with @entity90 , and a transplant is carried out if possible			1
adults are recommended by the @entity111 to have a healthy diet , regularly exercise and not drink too much alcohol , to reduce the chances of chronic kidney disease developing			0
it is estimated that around one in five men and one in four women aged between 65 and 74 has chronic kidney disease			0
there is no cure , but treatment can slow or halt its progression			0
now @entity38 is a happy , healthy two - year - old and should go on to live a normal life			2
she has just taken her first few steps			0
mrs @entity3 said : ‘ she 's eating real food now - she used to be fed through a tube in her nose , and her medication is gradually coming down			2
’ mr @entity30 added : ‘ now she 's a different child			0
she took her first full steps yesterday , she 's doing things we thought she 'd never do			0
‘ things finally look like they 're turning a corner and there 's a light at the end of the tunnel			0
it 's been a bit of a rollercoaster			0
we 've just had to deal with what we had to deal with as it came			0
‘ we are eternally thankful to the amazing renal team at the @entity43 , who made @entity38 's transplant possible			2
’ the family are determined to make people aware of the difference a donation can make			0
mrs @entity3 said : ‘ there are children all over the world with kidney problems that need help , and it 's not widely recognised			0
‘ it 's a completely different world that you do n't know about unless you have a poorly child			0
people are just not aware			0

@entity12 , two , was born in @entity5 without functioning kidneys
but her mother @entity15 , 38 , was found to be a match for a transplant
told at 30 - week scan there was just 50/50 chance baby would survive
