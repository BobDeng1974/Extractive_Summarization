they are perennial @entity1 title contenders , always there or thereabouts when the medals are handed out in may			2
but @entity5 and @entity6 have also established themselves as the pre-eminent forces in youth football , from the under - 21 standard that is one step away from the first team right down to the @entity12 just starting out			1
both clubs have invested millions of pounds into their academies as they aim to create a conveyor belt of talent good enough to play for their first team and they are starting to see a return			0
here , @entity5 's @entity25 ( right ) tries to fend off @entity6 's @entity26 in the @entity28 semi-final bright young thing : @entity30 celebrates his winner for @entity5 as they beat @entity32 2 - 1 in the final of last season 's @entity28 at @entity35 rising star : @entity6 's @entity37 , pictured here in the @entity40 match with @entity41 in which he scored three times in a 6 - 0 win , has been loaned out to @entity44 side @entity45 to gain experience at @entity5 , owner @entity47 has put in at least £ 100m to make the club 's training facility at @entity51 world class , while @entity6 will later this year open a £ 150m academy a stone 's throw from the @entity55			1
a look at the various competitions in the age groups from 21 downwards show @entity5 and @entity6 are increasingly going head - to - head in the latter stages			1
@entity5 won the @entity28 last season by beating @entity32 2 - 1 in the final at @entity35 , but they had defeated @entity6 on penalties in the semi-final after a goalless draw			1
@entity67 and @entity30 , two of @entity5 's most exciting young prospects , were on target to deliver the trophy to @entity71			0
indeed , @entity72 said recently that if @entity30 and other club prodigies @entity74 and @entity75 do n't go on to represent @entity76 , he will be to blame			0
investment : @entity5 owner @entity47 has spent over £ 100m to transform their @entity51 base into a world class academy but will be hoping more players can graduate into the first team millions : @entity84 ( right ) has overseen a £ 150m investment in @entity6 's new academy near the @entity55 blame me ! @entity72 has promised to guide young talents @entity30 , @entity74 and @entity75 to @entity76 contention @entity6 reached the final of the inaugural @entity91 but lost out 4 - 3 on aggregate to @entity93 over two legs			1
they had looked good to lift the trophy after two goals from @entity97 and another from @entity37 gave them a 3 - 2 advantage at home but @entity93 won the second leg 2 - 0 and turned the tie around			0
in the first season of the @entity104 , both teams registered some impressive results as they progressed to the quarter - finals			0
@entity6 's 6 - 0 rout of @entity41 in the group phase sent shockwaves across the continent - there were five @entity76 names on their teamsheet , though @entity114 star @entity37 stole the show with a hat - trick			2
mentor : @entity6 's @entity119 coach @entity118 with striker @entity97 , a talented @entity76 striker who is tipped for a big future for club and country tipped for stardom : @entity5 forward @entity75 is on the verge of breaking into the first team squad under 21 @entity1 - @entity5 @entity126 - @entity5 under 16 @entity127 - @entity5 under 14 @entity1 - @entity6 under 13 @entity127 - @entity5 under 11 national champions - @entity6 @entity5 achieved a 100 per cent record in the group and then thrashed @entity130 4 - 1 , with @entity30 scoring a wondergoal , before they bowed out to @entity132			1
with the frontiers of youth football expanding beyond these shores , both @entity6 and @entity5 will be targeting @entity137 success in the season to come			1
this will only intensify with the introduction of a continental competition for under 21 teams in 2014 - 2015 with both taking part			0
in the @entity126 , an under 18 competition , @entity5 stormed to their fourth final in five seasons and won their third competition in that time as they beat local rivals @entity148 in a classic two - legged final			1
@entity148 won the first leg 3 - 2 at @entity151 and led by the same scoreline at @entity71 before a rousing @entity5 fightback , capped by two @entity75 goals , earned them the @entity91			2
thrilling win : @entity156 lifts the @entity126 after @entity5 beat @entity148 6 - 5 on aggregate in the final while @entity5 dominated in the @entity91 , @entity6 came close in the @entity1 at under 18 level			1
after topping the @entity160 , they saw off @entity161 before losing 1 - 0 to @entity162 in the final at @entity164			0
their dominance is even more pronounced beneath under 18 level			0
in the @entity168 age bracket , the @entity1 stages tournaments and festivals instead of a league format in order to allow players to make the transition to full - size 11 vs 11 matches			2
at the last @entity176 , held back in october , @entity5 triumphed after beating @entity177 2 - 0 in the final at @entity179			0
the game was notable for an audacious 40 - yard free - kick by @entity5 's @entity182 that soared over the @entity177 goalkeeper 's head			2
moving younger still and guess which two teams contested the final of the @entity1 at @entity188 level ? an eight - team finals tournament was held at the @entity190 and @entity6 recovered from 2 - 0 down to beat @entity5 and retain the crown at that age group			1
and it was the same story at the recent @entity195 , also held at @entity179			0
the @entity1 invited @entity196 , @entity197 and @entity198 to take on the leading nine @entity76 clubs and @entity5 and @entity6 emerged from the pack to contest the final			1
after a 1 - 1 draw , @entity5 won 6 - 5 in a penalty shoot - out that were to sudden death			2
with @entity6 also the reigning champions at @entity208 level , it demonstrates that @entity5 and their @entity210 rivals are taking a firm stranglehold on youth competition at all ages			1
the positive rewards of their academy investment are starting to filter through an age range of over 10 years from under 21s to @entity12 and it is up to others to play catch - up			0
however , it will be argued that until both of these club 's first teams are full of academy graduates , the investment is not reaping its full reward .			0

@entity5 and @entity6 are increasingly going head - to - head in youth football competitions from under 21 standard downwards
both clubs have spent over £ 100m developing their academies
@entity5 are the reigning under 21 @entity1 champions and last season won the @entity126 for third time in five seasons
they are also the *current* @entity1 winners at @entity168 and under 13 level after tournament successes
city were beaten by @entity5 in semi-finals of under 21 @entity1
they were also *runners* - up in @entity248 and under 18 league
both are among favourites to win @entity40 this season
