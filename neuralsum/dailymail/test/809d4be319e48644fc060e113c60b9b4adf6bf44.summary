' @entity2 was incredible for @entity3 , he was exactly the player @entity4 needed to sign , ' @entity1 's @entity0 said back in february			1
the @entity6 midfielder had just put in a dominant display at the @entity8 as the @entity10 side all - but - sealed their place in the quarter - finals of the @entity13 after a 3 - 1 first - leg win			2
but rather than @entity4 , it now seems @entity16 hold the main @entity18 interest in the 22 - year - old			1
so , what more do you need to know ? @entity3 midfielder @entity2 is a @entity16 target and has also interested @entity4 in recent years 22 ? he 's been around for a while ... despite his young age , @entity2 has amassed over 100 league appearances for @entity26 , @entity3 , and even @entity27			1
and during that five - year professional career , the central midfielder has been constantly watched by @entity4 scouts			2
he also impressed at the @entity31 alongside @entity32 in the @entity6 midfield , while his frame and playing style does n't exactly scream 22 years old			0
@entity2 is only 22 but has racked up over 100 league appearances with @entity26 ( above ) , @entity27 and @entity3 the central midfielder was a key player for @entity37 alongside @entity32 at the @entity38 in 2013 tough guy then ? exactly			1
standing at 6 ' 2 " , @entity2 is a real presence in the @entity3 midfield , allowing the likes of @entity43 to strut their stuff further forward			0
he 's strong in the tackle , but make no mistake , his prowess on the ball is also impressive			0
possessing a fine left foot , @entity2 doubles up as a playmaker , and also scored the first goal in the tie in the first leg against @entity4			0
having made his mark in both @entity10 and @entity56 , you could say the @entity6 is the perfectly well - rounded midfielder , someone who would fit in seamlessly in the @entity18 ... @entity2 's fine strike put @entity3 in front against @entity4 in the @entity13 last - 16 first leg so why have n't we seen him in @entity61 ? @entity62 is still on @entity2 's side , but @entity18 clubs have certainly tried			1
@entity4 were heavily linked with him before he left @entity27 , though the versatile player bought out his contract and opted for @entity3			2
with @entity16 crying out for players to freshen up an ageing / departing spine , the 22 - year - old 's presence would surely suit @entity72			1
but he must move quick , with @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 and @entity76 all keen to sign the man who has been capped three times by his national team			0
@entity80 swapped shirts with @entity2 at half - time in the second leg at the @entity84			0

@entity2 impressed against @entity4 in the @entity13
*gunners* have scouted @entity6 midfielder for some time
but now @entity16 hold the main @entity18 interest in midfielder
22 - year - old is currently at @entity3 but has also played for @entity26 and @entity27
@entity0 : @entity4 should have signed @entity2
