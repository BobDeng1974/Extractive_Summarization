@entity0 believes @entity1 were denied the chance to sign @entity3 on transfer deadline day as @entity5 regard them as a threat			1
@entity0 , who had worked with @entity3 at @entity8 , wanted to take the @entity10 international on a season - long loan but @entity1 were forced to pull out of negotiations at a late stage			1
@entity3 subsequently joined @entity14 on loan but should things not work out for him in @entity17 , @entity0 has hinted he would be interested in signing him next summer			1
‘ that was an opportunity that we explored on the last day of the window but it could n't happen for different reasons			0
i do n't think there was just one aspect			0
‘ it 's the parent club that makes that decision			0
maybe they just did n't want to send a player on loan to a club that is going to be challenging for things and finished above them last season , i do n't know			1
’ relations between @entity1 and @entity5 were strained last summer , following @entity44 leaving @entity45 to move to @entity46 and @entity5 ’ s subsequent aggressive pursuit of @entity48 and @entity49			1
@entity0 says @entity1 looked at signing @entity3 on the last day of the transfer window ‘ i do n't think there is any bad feeling between the clubs ( following @entity49 / @entity48 ) , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ the chairman ( @entity54 ) has a very good relationship with @entity5 and , as a football club , we are not carrying any sour grapes about anything			2
‘ our information was that the player was n't available on loan full stop			2
you can look at the table from last season and we finished fifth and they finished a bit lower , so from that respect you can understand			0
‘ but , at the same time , @entity14 have started the season really well			2
they are going to be a strong team			0
but we ca n't comment on that , it is down to @entity5			2
a situation with @entity3 came up that i was happy to explore			0
in the end it did n't work out			0

@entity0 wanted to bring @entity3 to @entity1 in the summer
he claimed @entity5 did n't allow the move because they consider the @entity1 a threat after they finished *ahead* of them in the @entity79
@entity0 said o the midfielder : ' i am a big admirer of @entity3 '
@entity3 is now working under @entity84 on loan at @entity14
