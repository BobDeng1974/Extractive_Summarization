just last week , @entity8 - who is also @entity61 's artistic director and reportedly earns over $ 2 million a year - hosted her annual @entity10 at the @entity45 townhouse			1

@entity8 has built her reputation on precision on taste , so the fact she threw out her christmas tree before @entity10 should not come as a surprise to many in 2010 , neighboring streets such as @entity86 and @entity87 were closed from 9am in preparation for an evening soiree that was to be attended by @entity90 and @entity91 , among other celebrities and @entity53 movers and shakers			1
