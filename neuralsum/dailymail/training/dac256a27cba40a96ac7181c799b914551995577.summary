by @entity0 published : 18:03 est , 19 september 2013 updated : 05:26 est , 20 september 2013 @entity2 's report has faced criticism from leaders of the press who claim the inquiry and subsequent report has left all sides dissatisfied the legal chief of @entity11 newspaper says the outcome of the @entity13 is ‘ the worst of all worlds ’			1
@entity16 , whose newspaper was instrumental in sparking the inquiry into media standards , says that what @entity2 recommended has been ‘ disastrous ’			1
she describes one key @entity2 recommendation , championed by lobby group @entity24 and @entity25 politicians and previously backed by @entity11 , as ‘ a charter for people with dodgy claims ’			1
it was an incendiary @entity11 report in 2011 – which wrongly accused @entity31 journalists of deleting messages on murdered schoolgirl @entity34 ’s mobile phone – that provoked a public outcry			1
the inaccurate story brought about the closure of the sunday tabloid and led to @entity40 establishing the inquiry under @entity2			0
but ms @entity16 says the wrangling over press regulation following last year ’s inquiry and subsequent report has left all sides dissatisfied			1
she said : ‘ his attempt to please everybody and avoid being a dusty footnote on a shelf somewhere has led him down a road that has proved to be pretty disastrous			0
we do n’t have anything that could be perceived as effective or credible by either side of the debate			0
’ since @entity2 ’s report was published last november there has been disagreement between publishers , politicians and lobby groups over how to implement his recommendations for tougher press regulation			1
the @entity65 is currently considering a @entity66 put forward by the newspaper and magazine industry after negotiation with ministers			0
a rival charter , agreed over 2am pizzas by politicians and the hacked off lobby group , has yet to be submitted			1
the newspaper industry plans to launch early next year a tough new press watchdog , the @entity75 , with the power to impose fines of up to £ 1million for systemic wrongdoing and require editors to publish upfront corrections			0
but some critics of the industry , led by @entity24 , are demanding politicians have the last say over @entity84 , the @entity11 ’s director of editorial legal services , dismissed the use of royal charters as a ‘ medieval ’ tool that had been ‘ used by monarchs to circumvent @entity91 ’			2
she told the protecting the media conference in @entity94 this week she was opposed to any form of state involvement in regulating the @entity5			0
she cited the detention of @entity98 , the partner of @entity11 journalist @entity99 , who was detained for nine hours at @entity100 last month on his way from @entity102 to @entity103 carrying hard disks and memory sticks including secret files leaked by @entity108 analyst @entity107			0
claims that @entity31 ( former editor @entity110 pictured ) hacked the voicemail of murdered schoolgirl @entity34 were made by the @entity11 in 2011 but thrown out ‘ if anything demonstrates why we do not want a government regulating the press , @entity98 is that , ’ she said			2
‘ we live in a democratic state and they still did what they did to @entity98 for no good reason at all			0
it goes back to the whole debate about why we should n’t have the state regulating the @entity5			0
’ she also voiced concerns about one of @entity2 ’s key proposals – the setting up of a free arbitration service to decide damages claims against publishers			2
under the government - backed charter , the industry is obliged to set up the service that many local and regional papers fear is wide open to exploitation by ambulance - chasing lawyers			2
she told the conference : ‘ we are creating a charter for people with dodgy claims			1
people will be tempted to go and try to get some money			2
