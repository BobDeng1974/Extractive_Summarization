comedienne and author @entity0 has fronted a new @entity3 campaign to raise awareness concerning the @entity6 gender wage gap , in which she attends a staged sex change consultation			1
' every year the average woman loses around $ 11,000 to the wage gap , ' @entity10 , 43 , explains from a doctor 's office , flinging around a selection of prosthetic penises			1
' over the course of her working life , that 's almost $ 500,000			1
that 's a $ 500,000 vagina tax ... that 's why i 'm becoming a dude			1
' in the grand scheme of things , it 's way less expensive than the money i 'll lose having a p * * * y , ' she reasons , admiring penises dubbed ' @entity45 , ' ' the @entity46 , ' and ' the @entity42			1
' @entity47 , creative director of @entity48 , which masterminded the campaign , told @entity51 : ' equal pay may not be a sexy issue , but it 's an important one			1
' and it is absurd			0
young women need to know what 's at stake			0
and we knew that to get them to engage , we 'd need to play up that absurdity			0
' penis shopping : miss @entity0 claims , ' over the course of her working life , [ women lose ] almost $ 500,000			1
that 's a $ 500,000 vagina tax ... that 's why i 'm becoming a dude ' ' oh my god i 've got boots that would look amazing with this			1
i 'll take it ! ' miss @entity0 exclaims upon being matched with her ideal penis			0
' can you give me two really big balls ? i feel like i 'm gon na be a ball guy			0
it 's gon na take a lot of balls to tell women that the wage gap is fair			2
' and she has a point			0
according to the campaign , dubbed the @entity87 , women make up almost half the working population , yet typically earn just .76c - or .69c if they are mothers - for every dollar a man makes , in almost every profession			1
as the campaign points out , these figures mean that society owes working women nearly $ 30 trillion			1
found it ! miss @entity0 peruses a wide range of very realistic - looking prosthetic penises before deciding on the one she wants the @entity3 argues that this issue is n't been talked about enough			2
indeed , around 60per cent of private sector workers are discouraged or actively prohibited from talking about wages at work			0
' the wage gap is stubborn , it 's persistent and it 's outrageous , ' says the organization 's co-president @entity106			2
' we 're thrilled that @entity0 is bringing her prodigious talents and brand of irreverent humor to bear on a very serious issue for women and their families			0
' we hope she opens hearts and minds - and a few pocketbooks - to provide the resources to close the wage gap once and for all			2
' mind the gap ! according to the @entity87 , run by the @entity3 , women from chefs to surgeons and ceos make significantly less than their male counterparts fair ? professions dominated by men see employees also rake in higher weekly incomes on average than professions made up of mostly women the campaign is calling for donations to reach $ 30 trillion - the collective dollar total lost to the 69 million - strong female workforce over the course of their careers because of the gender pay gap			1
of course , this goal is nigh impossible , and set more to make a point			0
if it is reached , every working woman in the @entity6 will receive a check for $ 435,049 - the total amount she will lose to the gender pay gap			1
hot topic : @entity151 ( pictured ) recently made a @entity153 speech regarding gender equality if not , all funds will go to the @entity3 , where it will be used to push new legislation , promote flexible work hours , and keep employers accountable for existing legislation			1
' they 're very good at what they do , ' miss @entity0 assures us			0
' you know , for a bunch of girls			0
' miss @entity0 has been fighting for a wide range of social causes for much of her career			0
a vegan since she was ten years old , the comedienne and author of @entity173 , is currently in a relationship with @entity177 actor @entity176 , but has stated that she wo n't get married until same - same couples are legally permitted to do so			2
her satirical comedy addresses a wealth of social taboos and controversial topics such as racism , sexism , and religion ; and her latest screen appearance was over the weekend when she hosted @entity187			0
miss @entity0 is n't the only star giving air time to the issue of gender inequality			2
last month , @entity192 actress @entity151 made a much - lauded speech at the @entity194 in which she spoke passionately about feminism and women 's rights			0
miss @entity151 thus launched the @entity198 campaign , which strives for equal rights for men and women , including the political , economic and social equality of the sexes			2

the comedienne fronts the @entity87 , run by the @entity3
over the course of her life , the average @entity6 working woman will lose almost $ 500,000 to the gender pay gap
the *nonprofit* hopes to raise the money needed to push new legislation concerning equal pay
