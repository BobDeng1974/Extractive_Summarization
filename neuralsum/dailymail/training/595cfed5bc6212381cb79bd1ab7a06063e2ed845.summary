by @entity0 published : 09:33 est , 15 august 2013 updated : 15:01 est , 15 august 2013 police officers at this year 's @entity2 in @entity3 will dish out bags of @entity5 with messages outlining the new marijuana laws in @entity8 normally when the police show up it means the party 's over			1
but police officers in @entity3 will be adding to the fun this weekend by providing snacks at an marijuana festival			1
@entity18 's spokesman , sergeant @entity17 , said the department intends to use the opportunity to spread the word about new marijuana laws , by attaching a summarized version to bags of @entity5			1
the law came into effect in 2012 , and allows anyone to legally possess up to an ounce of recreational marijuana			1
but police are worried people still are n't clear enough on the rules			1
so , with the help of a former journalist , the @entity18 has composed its own guide to the law , ' marijwhatnow ? '			1
“ when the laws changed , there was a little bit of an informational vacuum about how police would react , ” @entity17 told @entity36			1
' @entity41 ' clearly states that @entity3 police will not arrest anyone for possessing under an ounce of marijuana , but also outlines the rules that do still exist in the state , and at federal level			1
@entity49 is an annual @entity3 event where marijuana enthusiasts gather in protest of strict cannabis laws			1
it is expected to attract over 200,000 people this weekend police will hand out 1,000 bags of @entity5 at @entity49 , which is expected to attract around 200,000 people			1
' we ’re there to let people know what the rules are			1
not everybody will get a bag , but hopefully people will talk about what ’s allowed and what ’s not			0
' @entity3 's @entity49 is the largest gathering advocating cannabis decriminalization in the world			1
it is expected to span two miles of @entity3 parks on friday , saturday and sunday			2
sergeant @entity17 is also a due to speak at the three - day event			0
' we wanted to do something in a fun way that said , " look this is cool and everything but the rules are the rules " he said			2
' i ’ll probably throw out a few bags of @entity5			1
' can i legally carry around an ounce of marijuana ? according to the recently passed initiative , beginning december 6th , adults over the age of 21 will be able to carry up to an ounce of marijuana for personal use			2
please note that the initiative says it “ is unlawful to open a package containing marijuana … in view of the general public , ” so there ’s that			2
also , you probably should n’t bring pot with you to the federal courthouse ( or any other federal property )			0
where can i legally buy pot , then ? the @entity99 is working to establish guidelines for the sale and distribution of marijuana			2
the @entity99 has until december 1 , 2013 to finalize those rules			1
in the meantime , production and distribution of non-medical marijuana remains illegal			2
can i grow marijuana in my home and sell it to my friends , family , and co-workers ? not right now			2
in the future , under state law , you may be able to get a license to grow or sell marijuana			2
can i smoke pot outside my home ? like at a park , magic show , or the @entity122 ? much like having an open container of alcohol in public , doing so could result in a civil infraction — like a ticket — but not arrest			0
you can certainly use marijuana in the privacy of your own home			2
additionally , if smoking a cigarette is n’t allowed where you are ( say , inside an apartment building or flammable chemical factory ) , smoking marijuana is n’t allowed there either			0
will police officers be able to smoke marijuana ? as of right now , no. this is still a very complicated issue			0
if i apply for a job at the @entity18 , will past ( or current ) marijuana use be held against me ? the current standard for applicants is that they have not used marijuana in the previous three years			1
in light of @entity150 , the department will consult with the @entity151 and the state attorney general to see if and how that standard may be revised			0
what happens if i get pulled over and an officer thinks i ’ve been smoking pot ? if an officer believes you ’re driving under the influence of anything , they will conduct a field sobriety test and may consult with a drug recognition expert			0
if officers establish probable cause , they will bring you to a precinct and ask your permission to draw your blood for testing			0
if officers have reason to believe you ’re under the influence of something , they can get a warrant for a blood draw from a judge			0
if you ’re in a serious accident , then a blood draw will be mandatory			0
the @entity18 seized a bunch of my marijuana before @entity150 passed			1
can i have it back ? no. will @entity18 assist federal law enforcement in investigations of marijuana users or marijuana - related businesses , that are allowed under @entity150 ? no. officers and detectives will not participate in an investigation of anything that ’s not prohibited by state law			1
december 6th seems like a really long ways away			0
what happens if i get caught with marijuana before then ? hold your breath			0
your case will be processed under current state law			0
however , there is already a city ordinance making marijuana enforcement the lowest law enforcement priority			0
what happens if i get caught smoking pot ? it ’s a violation of state law			0
it may referred to prosecutors , just like if you were a minor in possession of alcohol			0
