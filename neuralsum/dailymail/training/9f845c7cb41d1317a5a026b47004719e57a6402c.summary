when night falls in @entity1 , these days most people lock themselves fearfully in their homes			2
but a few still venture out , on a mission to drown out the thunder of artillery fire with the boom of dance music			2
though shells are raining down on suspected rebel positions in suburbs just a few miles away , these determined revellers head to the @entity14 capital 's night clubs to try to forget the war on their doorstep			1
' change of atmosphere ' : young people dance at a nightclub in downtown @entity1 , a city which , like the rest of @entity14 , has been riven by a 30 - month old civil war that is thought to have left 100,000 dead raving , i 'm raving : young men dressed in @entity27 - style clothes lift their hands in the air as a track thunders through the club 's @entity31 , drowning out the sound of artillery fire hurtling towards rebel - held suburbs ' i come here for a change of atmosphere , ' says @entity39 , a 25 - year - old car salesman , who has clearly had a drink or three			1
' there is joy here , ' he says of the nightclub in the upscale @entity45 neighbourhood , where the barman juggles bottles of spirits			2
' i want to live , i do n't want to hear any more bad news			2
' on the dance floor , customers shake to a track popular among supporters of president @entity55 's regime			0
' do n't ask me how or why , it 's the army that protects us , ' the lyric goes			0
' you and i salute @entity60 , ' a reference to president @entity55 's brother , who heads the elite army @entity63 but is in fact a colonel			0

but he asked that its name was not revealed for fear of reprisals among the performers is @entity83 , a 22 - year - old rapper , who returned to @entity1 just two months ago after spending the previous two years living in @entity86			2
he is determined to keep up a happy - go - lucky lifestyle despite the constant threat of death			2
' everyone 's going to die some day , but the @entity14 people love life and the most important thing is to be happy , ' he said			1
' if the @entity95 attacks us , i 'm sure our army will defend us , ' he added			0
' guys come here with their friends or with their girlfriends , to forget the week 's routine			0
' @entity103 's songs are heavy with nostalgia for the @entity1 of before the war when there were regular music festivals now he performs just once a fortnight at private parties			1
since the uprising against @entity55 's rule erupted in march 2011 , the authorities have been wary of public gatherings and it has become difficult to get the necessary authorisations			0
' it 's hard to get permission from the security services , ' @entity103 said			1
the nightclub does brisk business despite - or perhaps because of - the war raging outside			1
' we stay open until 2:00 am			2
it 's going well , ' said 29 - year - old manager @entity55			2
' but please do n't mention the club 's name			0

there are even some clubs where the champagne is still flowing '			0
