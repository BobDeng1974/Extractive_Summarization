the move is particularly controversial because @entity38 is a minister in the @entity39 , the ministry accused of cutting benefits			0

' no politician should appear to be in hock to any donor , because it gives the impression that any decision taken is influenced by sponsorship			0
' miss @entity1 , pictured in 2001 , is a former presenter on @entity60 and @entity61 mr @entity62 said there should be no need for politician to accept such money anyway , because stringent caps on how much can be spent during election campaigns means large donations are unnecessary			2
