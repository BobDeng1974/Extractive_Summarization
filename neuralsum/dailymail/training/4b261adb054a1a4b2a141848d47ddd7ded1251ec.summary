but what he did to me in the attic felt different , ' she said			0
what followed next was a drawn - out process in which @entity1 was dragged from one psychologist to the next , recounting her story over and over again to see if she was lying			2

she was a pawn in a huge fight between him and @entity6 years ago			2
the idea that she was molested was implanted in her mind by her mother			0
' [ @entity1 ] 's not lying , she truly believes this happened			2
that 's what the vice of this is - when you implant a story in the mind of a fragile seven - year - old ... it never goes away			0
