by @entity0 published : 11:39 est , 10 september 2013 updated : 14:02 est , 10 september 2013 a giant lizard that ruled the prehistoric seas up to 85 million years ago , killing anything in its path , was a skilled hunter as deadly as a shark , @entity2 scientists have said			1
at a time when @entity11 roamed the land , the @entity9 was the top predator underwater , using its tail fin to propel itself at speed and grab prey ranging from turtles to sharks			1
the terrifying creatures could grow up to 17 metres long , weigh as much as 20 tonnes and would have spent most of the day swimming near the seabed stalking their next meal from the cover of seaweed and rocks			1

the @entity9 used its tail fin to propel itself at speed and grab prey ranging from turtles to sharks			1
a fossil , skeleton diagram and illustration of the creature is pictured being caught in the jaws of a @entity9 meant almost certain death , although the lizards were still vulnerable to attack themselves , with one fossil bearing the marks of a shark bite in its spine			2
the latest and best specimen was dug up from rocks in central @entity46 , with part of its soft tissue preserved , including the perfect outlines of its tail fin and flippers			1
a member of the mosasaur family , the marine reptile discovered measured just five feet long and was a juvenile when it died			0
it would have ended up six times its size had it lived			0
although early members of the genus possessed body shapes similar to today â€™s monitor lizards , their bodies have traditionally been portrayed as long , sleek animals with broad tapered tails			0
this led to the idea that they were slow swimmers but the new fossil described in @entity71 has a crescent - shaped tail fin similar to whales and extinct marine reptiles called ichthyosaurs that resembled dolphins			2
the latest and best specimen was dug up from rocks in central @entity46 , with part of its soft tissue preserved , including the perfect outlines of its tail fin and flippers , which indicates the lizard was a highly efficient swimmer comparing the fossil to modern sharks led scientists to the conclusion mosasaurs were very good swimmers and their highly specialised tail evolved independently in several groups that occupied similar environments			1
dr @entity91 , of @entity92 in @entity2 , said they were similar swimmers to sharks , ' a finding that significantly expands our understanding of the level of aquatic adaptation achieved by these seagoing lizards			2
' he described the skeleton , which is complete save for the head and part of the tail , as ' extraordinary '			2
dr @entity91 said : ' the bones are generally in a pristine condition and retain their original three - dimensional shape , although some skeletal elements were fractured or lost during the excavation of the fossil ; the latter are now represented by natural moulds			0
' in addition , plant rootlets have penetrated and partially dissolved a string of vertebrae near the end of the tail			0
' the exposed elements of the pectoral girdle and rib cage are somewhat disturbed and the latter structure has suffered slight crushing ; otherwise , the skeleton is in nearly perfect articulation , preserving , for example , a virtually complete , hydrofoil - like forelimb surrounded by skin impressions			0
' the terrifying creatures could grow up to 17 metres long , weigh as much as 20 tonnes and would have spent most of the day swimming near the seabed stalking their next meal from the cover of seaweed and rocks @entity136 breathed air , were powerful swimmers and were so well adapted to living in the warm , shallow seas prevalent during the @entity140 that they gave birth to live young , rather than return to the shore to lay eggs			1
dr @entity91 said : ' the findings in the present study on @entity9 , along with recent previous work on the streamlined body shape , keeled scales and modified limbs provide compelling evidence derived mosasaurs were hydrodynamically advanced animals capable of high efficiency swimming			0
' moreover , the emerging evidence suggests aquatic adaptations evolved relatively quickly within the group , that is , within less than 10 million years			0

*archaeologists* have discovered an ' extraordinary ' skeleton of a @entity9 in central @entity46 with part of its soft tissue preserved
the terrifying creatures , which lived 85 million - years - ago , could grow up to 17 metres long and weigh as much as 20 tonnes
comparing the fossil to modern sharks , @entity2 scientists concluded the lizard was a good swimmer with a highly specialised tail fin
