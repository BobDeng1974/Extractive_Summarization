@entity0 was under fire last night over a ‘ sickening ’ suggestion that the row over @entity5 links to tax avoidance could be another ‘ @entity8 moment ’ to be exploited for political gain			1
the toxic claim was made by one of the @entity13 ’s most senior aides , as mr @entity0 tried to drive home his efforts to link @entity5 donors to the tax avoidance scandal involving clients of @entity20 ’s @entity19 private bank			1
@entity13 last night said the exact phrase ‘ @entity8 moment ’ had not been used , and said the only comparison between the issues was the way they had ‘ crystallised ’ public opinion			1
@entity40 , a solicitor who represented the @entity42 family over phone hacking , last night condemned the intervention			2
he said : ‘ it is rather inappropriate that someone would regard the hacking of a murdered schoolchild as a political opportunity rather than the tragedy it was			2
’ @entity5 mp @entity51 , a member of the @entity52 , described the comparison as ‘ sickening ’			1
he said : ‘ i am genuinely shocked that anyone would make such an utterly distasteful and revolting comparison			2
’ the row erupted after @entity58 political editor @entity57 posted a message on @entity60 saying : ‘ the @entity13 ’s aides say that he sees this as another @entity8 moment			1
’ mr @entity57 later stressed the comment – which emerged from a lunch with mr @entity0 ’s chief spin doctor @entity67 – was not a direct quote			1
a @entity13 spokesman said : ‘ an official talked about how the news story on @entity8 crystallised what a lot of people thought about the @entity75			1
‘ and this tax avoidance story on @entity20 crystallises what a lot of people thought about tax avoiders			2
the words “ @entity8 moment ” never cropped up			1
’ @entity5 @entity83 last night urged the @entity13 leader to sack mr @entity67 , a former journalist			1
@entity85 said : ‘ @entity67 , like his mentor @entity86 , represents the ugly underbelly of @entity13			1
‘ @entity67 ’s actions are utterly unforgivable			2
’ mr @entity67 declined to comment			2
mr @entity0 claimed the row with former @entity5 treasurer @entity92 was ' a defining moment ' in the general election campaign the controversy overshadowed the row between mr @entity0 and the former @entity5 treasurer @entity92 over his tax affairs			1
on wednesday , lord @entity92 challenged the @entity13 leader over claims that he was involved in ‘ tax avoidance activities ’ after he was named as one of the clients of @entity20 ’s @entity19 private bank			1
mr @entity0 also appeared to suggest lord @entity92 was a ‘ dodgy ’ donor			1
lord @entity92 challenged mr @entity0 to repeat the claims outside the @entity52 – where he has protection from libel laws – saying he would sue him for defamation if he did			1
in a partial climbdown yesterday , mr @entity0 said he did not consider lord @entity92 to be ‘ dodgy ’			1

oh , and he ’s worth £ 180million			2

so who exactly is lord @entity92 ? where does his money come from ? and how great is his influence in @entity5 circles ? he is known as the @entity140 of hedge funds after turning a humble commodities firm called the @entity143 , which sold rum to the @entity146 navy , into the biggest fund in the world with assets of £ 80billion			1

the following year he surprised the @entity172 when he returned with a new hedge fund , @entity260			0

it was unprecedented for a @entity5 treasurer to publicly denounce a @entity5 chancellor but @entity92 did so , and it was a decisive intervention			1
within days @entity319 had backed down .			0

@entity0 thinks row over tax dodging makes him appear on *voters* ' side
aides said the @entity13 leader sees *parallels* to @entity8 case
@entity13 leader said @entity307 was ' dodgy *pm* surrounded by dodgy donors '
he accused @entity5 donor @entity92 of avoiding tax with @entity19 bank account

the @entity13 leader today *insisted* he stood by his @entity52 remarks
but mr @entity0 stopped short of accusing @entity92 of being ' dodgy '
