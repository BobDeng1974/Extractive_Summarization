by @entity0 published : 12:15 est , 29 april 2013 updated : 01:41 est , 30 april 2013 @entity1 is trying to upstage @entity2 , the sometimes droll assistant that answers questions and helps people manage their lives on @entity8 's @entity7 and @entity9			1
the duel begins monday with the release of a free @entity7 and @entity9 app that features @entity13 , a technology that performs many of the same functions as @entity2			1
it 's the first time that @entity1 now has been available on smartphones and tablet computers that are n't running on the latest version of @entity1 's @entity20 software			2
@entity13 on the @entity7 and @entity9 - the new app , launched today , will compete with @entity8 's @entity2 smartphones and tablet computers running @entity1 's free @entity20 software have been steadily expanding their market share in recent years , partly because they tend to be less expensive than the @entity7 and @entity9			1
at the end of 2012 , @entity20 devices held about 69 percent of the smartphone market while @entity28 held about 19 percent , according to the research firm @entity29			0
the technology , which debuted nine months ago , is being included in an upgrade to @entity1 's search application for @entity28 , the @entity8 software that powers the @entity7 , @entity9 and @entity34			1
it 's up to each user to decide whether to activate @entity13 within the redesigned search app. @entity13 's invasion of @entity2 's turf marks @entity1 's latest attempt to lure @entity7 and @entity9 users away from a service that @entity8 built into its own devices			1
@entity1 quickly won over millions of @entity7 users in december when it released a mapping application to replace the navigation system that @entity8 dumped when it redesigned @entity28 last fall			1
@entity8 's maps application proved to be inferior to @entity1 's ousted service			1
the app 's bugs and glitches made @entity8 the butt of jokes and fueled demand for @entity1 to develop a new option			1
@entity8 has been losing to @entity1 on other fronts in a rapidly growing mobile computing market , an arena that was revolutionized with the @entity7 's release in 2007			1
smartphones and tablet computers running @entity1 's free @entity20 software have been steadily expanding their market share in recent years , partly because they tend to be less expensive than the @entity7 and @entity9			1
@entity8 's @entity2 personal assistant offer similar services , and is integrated into the @entity7 and @entity9 at the end of 2012 , @entity20 devices held about 69 percent of the smartphone market while @entity28 held about 19 percent , according to the research firm @entity29			1
@entity20 's success has been particularly galling for @entity8 because its late ceo @entity72 believed @entity1 stole many of its ideas for the software from the @entity7			1
that led to a series of court battles over alleged patent infringement , including a high - profile trial last year that culminated in @entity8 winning hundreds of millions in damages from @entity82 , the top seller of @entity20 phones			0
that dispute is still embroiled in appeals			0
the rise of @entity20 also is squeezing @entity8 's profit margins , and has contributed to a 40 percent drop in the company 's stock price since it peaked at $ 705.07 last september around the time that the @entity7 came out			1
@entity20 's popularity is good news for @entity1 because the company 's services are built into most versions of the operating system			2
that brings more traffic to @entity1 services , creating more opportunities for the company to sell ads - the main source of @entity1 's revenue			2
@entity2 is billed by @entity8 as an ' intelligent feature ' since the technology 's release in october 2011 , @entity8 has made it a centerpiece of some marketing campaigns that depict @entity2 and its automated female voice as an endearing and occasionally even pithy companion			2
when asked for an opinion about @entity13 , @entity2 responded : ' if it 's all the same to you , i 'd rather @entity1 later			1
' @entity1 believes its @entity2 counterpart is smarter because @entity13 is designed to learn about a user 's preferences and then provide helpful information before it 's even asked to do so			1
the technology draws upon information that @entity1 gleans from search requests other interactions with the company 's other services			0
knowing a person 's location also helps @entity1 now serve up helpful information without being asked			0
' this concept of predicting your needs and showing you them at the right time is unique to @entity13 , ' said @entity132 , @entity13 's director of product management			0
lined up for battle : @entity8 's current @entity7 software , called @entity28 , is expected to receive a major overhaul in june ' we want computers to do the hard work so our users can focus on what matters to them so they can get on with their lives			1
' if the technology is working right , @entity13 is supposed to do things like automatically tell people what the local weather is like when they awaken to help decide what to wear and provide a report on traffic conditions for the commute to work			0
during the day , @entity1 now might provide an update on the score of a user 's favorite sports team or a stock quote of a company in a user 's investment portfolio			0
on a friday evening , @entity1 now might offer suggestions for movies to see or other weekend events tailored to a user 's interests			0
for international travelers , @entity1 now might provide currency conversion rates , language translations of common phrases and the time back home			0
most of this automatic information is provided in summaries that @entity1 calls ' cards			0
' like @entity2 , @entity13 also is equipped with voice technology that allows it to respond to questions and interact with users , though it has n't shown the wit that amuses some of @entity2 's users			2
the @entity13 app for @entity28 is n't as comprehensive as the @entity20 app , which only works on devices running on the latest version of @entity20 - known as ' @entity184			0
' some of the @entity20 features missing from @entity13 's @entity28 app include cards for showing airline boarding passes and movie tickets bought though online vendor @entity190			0
both of those options are available on the @entity28 through @entity8 's built - in passbook feature that 's designed to be a digital wallet			2
@entity1 vs @entity8 : the move is the latest in a long running battle for smartphone supremacy @entity13 's expansion on to the @entity28 underscores @entity1 's ambitions for the service			1
the company , which is based in @entity202 , @entity203 , views it as a pivotal tool in its effort to peer deeper into its users ' brains			0
in doing so , @entity1 believes it will be able to provide more useful services and also show more relevant ads. for @entity13 to become more intuitive , it needs to widen its availability			2
' the more you use @entity13 , we will have a better chance of understanding what your needs are and providing you with the right information , ' @entity132 said			0
' it 's a virtuous cycle			0
' @entity132 declined to discuss whether there are plans to make @entity13 apps for mobile devices running on @entity224 's @entity223 system			0
he also refused to comment on speculation circulating in technology blogs that a web version of @entity13 will be offered as a replacement for @entity229 , a tool that allows people to encircle the @entity1 search engine with a variety of services suited to their tastes			2
@entity229 is scheduled to close in november .			0

@entity1 launches @entity13 service for @entity7 and @entity9
will compete directly with @entity8 's @entity2 service
