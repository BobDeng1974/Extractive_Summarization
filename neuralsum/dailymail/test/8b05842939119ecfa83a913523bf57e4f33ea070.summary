former @entity1 manager @entity0 says that @entity2 have not made any progress under @entity4 this season , insisting he has been rescued by the kids			1
spurs are almost certain to miss out on @entity8 football again with club currently occupying a place only in the top six , although they did reach their first major final since 2009 this season			1
@entity12 boss @entity4 has put his faith in the likes of @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 , while more experienced , higher - profile players have been pushed out to the fringes			1
@entity0 says @entity2 manager @entity4 has been rescued by the kids this season @entity15 has scored 20 @entity22 goals this season , while @entity17 and @entity24 has played a key role @entity0 insists the club have not moved forward under their @entity12 manager this season and former @entity2 boss @entity0 , who led the club to two top - four finishes during his tenure , says that a sixth or seventh place finish this season is not progress			1
' i like the manager , i think he 's excellent , ' @entity0 told @entity34			2
' he is a great guy as well			2
' but let 's be honest , they have n't pulled up any trees			2
finishing sixth or seventh is certainly not going forward			2
but he needs another year			0
' really , he 's been rescued by the kids this season - @entity15 , @entity17 , @entity16 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42			1
former @entity1 boss @entity0 was also critical of @entity2 's recruitment policy after selling @entity45 @entity46 joined the club for £ 25.9million but has struggled to make an impact ' they have been the best players at the club and have probably kept them going			1

@entity46 ( £ 25.9million ) , @entity55 ( £ 25m ) and @entity56 ( £ 17m ) have all struggled to justify their hefty price tags			0

the players that have been brought in are n't down to him			0
' the big signings that have come in have been a disaster			0
that is something @entity71 is going to have to look at , the recruitment was poor			0
' they have changed that around now and i think they have new people coming in			0
they have to make sure when they make more signings , they 're better than the ones they 've got			0
