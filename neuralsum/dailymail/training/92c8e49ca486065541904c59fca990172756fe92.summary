two wealthy couples who spent £ 500,000 on a venomous legal battle over ‘ a few feet ’ of muddy ditch between their homes have been slammed by judges for their ' absurd ' waste of money			1
the couples each lavished six - figure sums on the dispute about a drainage ditch running alongside a bridle path between their properties in @entity14			1
today judges ruled on an appeal launched by one of the couple 's , giving sole ownership of the lane while allowing the other couple limited usage			1
but they criticised the toxic legal battle , calling it ' dickensian ' and pointing out that it had lasted longer than some murder trials			2
bitter : the couples each lavished six - figure sums on the dispute about a drainage ditch running alongside a bridle path between their properties in @entity14			1
far right , the @entity32 ' property and left , the @entity30 ' @entity33 and his wife @entity34 won a ruling in 2013 that stated they owned the ditch and and half of the adjoining track that runs next to their five - acre property in @entity42			1
the couple use the route as a shortcut to @entity46 – home to sir @entity48 and a host of other celebrities			2
their neighbours , @entity53 , 75 , and his wife @entity54 , 63 – who breed alpacas and wallabies – appealed the decision , fearing their animals were being disturbed by passing traffic			0
judges ruled today that the disputed track falls entirely within the boundary of their home			1
but the court also stated that the @entity30 still hold the right to drive vehicles along the path in one direction , but only for agricultural purposes			0
and the couples were today criticised by judges who expressed ' dismay ' at the trial , which had lasted longer than some murder trials			1
dispute : @entity33 ( left ) won a ruling in their favour in 2013 but his rival @entity53 , right , who said the @entity30 ' cars disturb the animals they breed , won his appeal today describing the dispute as ' depressingly unfortunate ' , sir @entity83 said : ' the costs so far approach half a million pounds , far more that the value of the rights involved '			1
while lord justice @entity88 described the couples ' ' wasteful endeavours ' in court as an ' absurd waste of effort '			1
@entity94 added : ' i only add how dismayed i have been by this dickensian litigation '			0
he pointed out that the toxic legal battle has taken up 13 days of court time , ' more than some murder trials '			2
shared : judges ruled that the track , pictured above , belongs solely to the @entity102 , but stated the @entity30 could still use it - in one direction , and only for agricultural purposes the area surrounding @entity42 and @entity46 is home to football stars including @entity109 , @entity110 and @entity111			1
the @entity32 ' counsel , @entity112 , said that the couples initially got on well after the @entity30 moved into their property in 2004			0
however , they fell out bitterly over a planning dispute and then went to war over the ditch and the track			1
the @entity30 won a ruling at @entity120 in december 2013 , when judge @entity121 drew their boundary in the middle of @entity124			1
' absurd ' : @entity125 ( left ) and her husband @entity126 , and @entity127 ( right ) and her husband @entity128 were slammed by judges after spending nearly £ 500,000 on their ' toxic ' legal battle overturning that decision today , sir @entity83 ruled that the whole of the track belongs to @entity134 and mrs @entity127			1
however , through long useage , @entity134 and mrs @entity125 had acquired a right to drive agricultural vehicles along the lane , he said			1
@entity94 today expressed his dismay at the toxic legal battle , describing it as an example of ' dickensian litigation '			2
the statement references @entity145 ' novel @entity146 , which was published in instalments between 1852 and 1853			0
the novel dramatises the flaws in the @entity150 , which handled cases such as property disputes at the time , and was seen as an ineffective , expensive and technically difficult system			0
the plot is centered around the @entity155 vs @entity155 suit , which spans a number of years			0
over the course of the litigation , the happiness and lives of those involved is destroyed as the family become obsessed with pursuing their claims and waiting for the long - expected judgement			0
in the end , the costs of the case are found to have consumed the property in dispute			0
the right of way only runs east , and not south , from the property 's gate and is for agricultural purposes only			0
lamenting the couples ' decision to take the issue to the courts , sir @entity83 said : ' this is a dispute which could and should have been compromised on terms that both parties could live with '			2
@entity94 added : ' the disputed strip of land and right of way do not constitute the sole means of access to anyone 's home '			0
' at a time when the courts are under great pressure , the battle between these two couples took up 10 days of court time - more than some murder trials - before @entity198 and three days in the @entity199			2
' about half a million has been spent in costs - it is as though ... civil procedured reformers over the years have laboured in vain '			0
lord @entity204 said : ' the enmity of the parties has caused them to incur costs and to use up the time of the courts , to the detriment of other litigants , to an extent grossly disproportionate to what was at stake			0
' if parties , or one of them , insist on litigating in this way , it is difficult for the court to cut short their wasteful endeavours , however much it may try to do so			0
' i hope that the example of this litigation may encourage others who are concerned in like disputes ... to take every step that they can to avoid the absurd waste of effort , time and cost , for both parties , which this case has involved ' .			2
