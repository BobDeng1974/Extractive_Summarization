by @entity0 last updated at 1:59 pm on 3rd october 2011 a @entity2 military hardware company has revealed the latest prototype for a robotic battlefield ' pack mule '			2
@entity6 is the next generation of the @entity9 project , which is in development at @entity11 with funding from @entity13 and the @entity14			1
the mechanical quadruped - which bears a passing resemblance to the @entity18 walkers from the @entity20 films - has a series of improvements on its predecessor which will leave the @entity9 cowering in its kennel			1
see @entity6 in action below ... @entity6 : the robot horse prototype , made by @entity11 , is designed to carry military equipment in battle to make soldiers lighter and more mobile do push me : the @entity6 is able to stand up to the pressure of two men pushing it over , or even kicking it , which would help it resist nearby bomb blasts too though headless , it resembles a horse more than a dog in both size and strength , with increased endurance and distance capabilities that allow it to carry 400lbs of payload and trek for 20 miles			1
it is also now virtually silent			0
the @entity9 was saddled with a whining noise that was akin to a low powered motorcycle engine , but the @entity6 seemingly makes no sound other than those of its ' hooves ' on the ground			1
and where the @entity9 looked like ' @entity55 on ice ' when it was unsteadied by undulating ground due to its long thin legs , the @entity60 's thicker legs make it more powerful and stable			1
the prototype is formally known as the @entity62 , which stands for @entity63			2
steady as she goes : @entity6 's @entity66 hydraulics enables it to walk over uneven ground self - righting : @entity6 is able to flip itself back onto its ' feet ' if it is knocked onto its side it is designed to carry equipment for troops and is capable of navigating uneven ground such as steps , hills , rubble and logs thanks to its gps , computer vision and the eerily realistic leg movement offered by state - of - the - art hydraulics			2
star wars : the @entity6 bears a resemblance to the @entity18 walking machines features in the sci - fi films @entity6 is set to be officially unveiled next year but the video below shows the latest developments			0
it is now able to steady itself when pushed and kicked powerfully by two men , but most impressively if it does fall onto its side , @entity6 has a full self - righting mechanism that will return it to its ' feet '			0
as technological advances improve the range of weapons and equipment at soldiers ' disposal , so their loads become heavier			0
@entity100 commanders in @entity101 have previously warned that today 's troops are simply too weighed down by kit when on foot patrol as they lug up to 150lb - in summer temperatures that push 50 degrees centigrade			0
' if @entity109 can offload 50 pounds from the back of each soldier in a squad , it will reduce warfighter injuries and fatigue and increase the combat effectiveness of our troops , ' @entity107 , the president of @entity11 , told @entity118 .			0

new *version* of the @entity9 project is ten times *quieter* than previous prototype
it can carry 400lb payload for 20 miles without *refueling*
