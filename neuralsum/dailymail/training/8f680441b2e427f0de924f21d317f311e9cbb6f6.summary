patients should be able to top - up their @entity2 treatment with an extr payment in return for an ‘ enhanced ’ service , a report suggests			1
stock photo patients should have the option to top - up their @entity2 treatment with small monthly payment in return for an ‘ enhanced ’ service , a report suggests			1
allowing people who can afford it to invest extra money would raise billions of pounds and give all patients a better healthcare experience , the authors say			1
those who choose to pay - a sum starting from £ 100 per year for someone on a wage of £ 20,000 - would still receive the standard service in @entity2 hospitals and clinics			0
but by voluntarily paying extra they could avoid long waiting times for procedures and seek treatment in any centre in the country if they are subject to a postcode lottery where they live , according to the report by the think tank @entity36			1
it recommends that better - off patients be able to buy extra treatment , which is not currently available , from @entity2 trusts as well as private providers			1
the authors , @entity2 consultant dr @entity42 and researcher @entity43 argue that this ‘ contribution scheme ’ would alleviate the current stress on the health service and offset the need for higher taxes across the board , while also staying true to the principle of free healthcare at the point of use			1
they say polls show there is a ‘ public appetite ’ for increased contributions to the health service , with one survey suggesting 60pc of the public would be willing to pay increased income tax if it went towards healthcare			2
‘ the proposed @entity2 contribution scheme would help safe - guard the @entity2 's core commitment to meeting the needs of everyone ’ , they say			1
‘ where @entity2 services are known to be poor , the alternative of seeking treatment elsewhere will be available to patients			2
this is one means of challenging the existing ' postcode lottery ' where patients have widely differing quality of @entity2 treatment in different areas of the country			2
‘ money raised from the contribution fee could then be invested in these weak or inefficient aspects of @entity2 service , improving the level of care for those who use them , even where they are non-contributors to the scheme			2
’ allowing patients to top up what is known as their ‘ personal budget ’ set by the @entity2 , would save money and avert the need for any further reorganisations of the health service , they say			1
‘ it would simply act as an add - on ; allowing individual patients who chose to contribute , an increased personal choice of provider instead of having to use those providers made available by the present block tendering out of services by commissioners			0
’ they propose a contribution of 0.5pc of income deducted each month from their payroll like income tax			0
they believe the scheme could raise £ 3.5 billion a year depending on how many people sign up			0
the authors , @entity2 consultant dr @entity42 and researcher @entity43 , argue that this ‘ contribution scheme ’ would alleviate the current stress on the health service after four consecutive monthly payments - to avoid individuals contributing only when anticipating illness - those who take part would be entitled to access their personal treatment budget			1
‘ the additional income could encourage investment in separate facilities for elective procedures that are often cancelled at short notice when there is pressure on @entity133 departments ’			0
contributors could also benefit from extras aimed at encouraging people to take more responsibility for their own health , such as annual ‘ health mots ’ for a lower price than with private providers			0
the health service is projected to face a £ 30billion funding hap by the year 2020			0
both the @entity144 , @entity145 and the @entity146 have promised billions more for the @entity2 over the next five years but will still fall short of the funding needed			0
the @entity36 proposal would create a two - tier system , as the authors acknowledge , but they say this has already been created by the advent of private healthcare			0
but critics suggest that if the middle classes take on fees and receive better treatment , they may be less likely to stand up and flight for better services for all			0
a @entity162 spokeswoman said : ‘ the @entity2 will remain free at the point of use and patients can already choose where they have @entity2 treatment			2

allowing those who can afford it to invest extra would raise billions and give all patients a better healthcare experience , report says
by voluntarily paying extra they could avoid long waiting times for procedures and seek treatment in any centre
authors argue ‘ contribution scheme ’ would alleviate current stress on @entity2
