incense smoke wafts through the cold air of the centuries - old @entity3 temple as a priest chants a sutra , praying for the peaceful transition of the souls of the departed			2
some @entity9 owners of robot dog aibo believe their ' pet ' have souls it is a funeral like any other in @entity9			1
except that those being honoured are robot dogs , lined up on the altar , each wearing a tag to show where they came from and which family they belonged to			2
the devices are ' @entity22 ' , the world 's first home - use entertainment robot equipped with @entity25 ( @entity25 ) and capable of developing its own personality			1
during the footage , employees are seen kicking @entity44 to prove how stable the machine is on its feet , but this has been dubbed ' cruel ' , ' wrong ' and has raised concerns about ethics ' i believe owners feel they have souls as long as they are with them , ' said @entity56 , 59 , who heads an electronics repair company specialising in fixing vintage products			1
@entity59 rolled out the first - generation @entity22 in june 1999 , with the initial batch of 3,000 selling out in just 20 minutes , despite the hefty 250,000 yen ( more than $ 2,000 ) price tag			1
over the following years , more than 150,000 units were sold , in numerous iterations , ranging from gleaning metallic - silver versions to round - faced cub - like models			2
the dog came with an array of sensors , a camera and microphone			2
the final generation could even talk			2
by 2006 , @entity59 was in trouble ; its business model was broken and it was facing fierce competition from rivals in all fields			1
the @entity22 , an expensive and somewhat frivolous luxury , had to go			1
the company kept its ' @entity80 ' open until march 2014 , but then -- politely -- told dedicated and loving owners that they were on their own			1
robot dog aibo is seen next to ' @entity85 ' , a @entity87 breed , outside the @entity88 in @entity89 , @entity9 's @entity91 prefecture © @entity35 ( @entity37 ) @entity88 chief priest @entity92 ( r ) offers a prayer during the funeral for 19 @entity59 's pet robot @entity22 , in @entity89 , @entity9 's @entity91 prefecture © @entity35 ( @entity37 ) @entity98 supervisor @entity97 ( @entity30 ) puts the @entity59 's pet robot @entity22 on the altar , prior to the robots ' funeral at the @entity88 in @entity89 , @entity9 's @entity91 prefecture © @entity35 ( @entity37 ) in a recent paper by dr @entity104 from the @entity105 at @entity106 , he posed the question : ' in the future it 's possible we will be able to create artificially human brains that emulate a real human - but what are the ethicalities and moralities of doing this ?			1
' in particular , in his ' ethics of brain emulations ' research , dr @entity104 considers a future in which @entity25 may be commonplace in so - called ' lesser beings '			2
if brain emulation becomes possible we could in theory clone animals to create , for example , virtual laboratory rats			2
there is much opposition to performing scientific experiments on rats and other animals in the modern day - but dr @entity104 questions whether people will have similar objections to experimenting on an animal that was artificially created			0
dr @entity104 likened the scenario to abortion in the modern day and the battle between people who are pro-choice and those who are pro-life			0
if an emulation was run for just a millisecond of time before being deactivated , some might argue that this would constitute a ' murder ' of sorts , destroying a life as it had been created			0
for @entity29 , 70 , that nearly spelled disaster			0
@entity153 has had her aibo for around eight years			0
she enjoys the conversations she has with it , and thinks it far more convenient than a real puppy			0
' he does n't require feeding and he does n't pee ... actually he does pee by cocking his leg , making an indescribably beautiful tinkling sound			0
' but , she said , nothing actually comes out			0
' i never thought there was a limit to his life			0
' but in may last year her beloved @entity22 , whose name is simply ' aibo ' , became immobile			1
' i e-mailed a former @entity59 worker ( on behalf of the dog ) , saying : ' do i have no choice but to die like this because i ca n't walk ? ' , ' she said			1
the engineer introduced her to a fun , a company that employs former @entity59 engineers , who fixed her machine in two months			1
' i was so happy to see him back to health and at home , ' she said			0
@entity97 , 61 , who supervises repairs at a fun , said troubled aibo owners think of him more as a doctor than an engineer			1
' the word ' repair ' does n't fit here , ' he told @entity37 at his home in @entity191 , north of @entity36			0
scattered around him are dozens of @entity22 sent in with problems owners typically describe as ' aching joints '			1
earlier this year , @entity194 ( pictured ) similarly likened artificial intelligence to ' summoning the demon '			1
the @entity199 and @entity198 founder previously warned that the technology could someday be more harmful than nuclear weapons earlier this year , @entity194 likened artificial intelligence to ' summoning the demon '			1
the @entity199 and @entity198 founder previously warned that the technology could someday be more harmful than nuclear weapons			0
and speaking at the @entity205 ( @entity205 ) @entity206 in october , @entity194 described artificial intelligence as our ' biggest existential threat '			1
he said : ' i think we should be very careful about artificial intelligence			1
if i had to guess at what our biggest existential threat is , it 's probably that			0
so we need to be very careful with artificial intelligence			1
' i 'm increasingly inclined to think that there should be some regulatory oversight , maybe at the national and international level , just to make sure that we do n't do something very foolish			0
' with artificial intelligence we 're summoning the demon			1
you know those stories where there 's the guy with the pentagram , and the holy water , and … he 's sure he can control the demon ? does n't work out			0
' in august , he warned that @entity25 could to do more harm than nuclear weapons			0
tweeting a recommendation for a book by @entity234 called @entity235 : paths , dangers , strategies that looks at a robot uprising , he wrote : ' we need to be super careful with @entity25			2
potentially more dangerous than nukes			0
' in a later tweet , @entity194 wrote : ' hope we 're not just the biological boot loader for digital superintelligence			0
unfortunately , that is increasingly probable			0
' mr @entity194 has previously claimed that a horrific ' terminator - like ' scenario could be created from research into artificial intelligence			1
the 42 - year - old is so worried , he is investing in @entity25 companies , not to make money , but to keep an eye on the technology in case it gets out of hand			2
in march , mr @entity194 made an investment @entity261 - based @entity25 group @entity259 , along with @entity262 and actor @entity263			0
in october 2013 , the company announced it had developed an algorithm that ' reliably ' solves modern @entity266 - the world 's most widely used test of a machine 's ability to act human			0
' for those who keep @entity22 , they are nothing like home appliances			1
it 's obvious they think their ( robotic pet ) is a family member , ' he said			0
@entity97 says he does not enhance the functions of aged @entity22 , but tries to restore them to health			1
the problem is that repairs can take weeks or even months because of a shortage of spare parts			2
dozens of @entity22 are now ' hospitalised ' , with more than 180 on the waiting list			1
the only source of genuine parts are ' dead ' robots , who become donors for organ transplantation , but only once the proper respects have been paid			2
@entity92 , a priest at the 450 - year - old @entity88 in @entity89 , east of @entity36 , says the @entity22 service last month was an occasion on which the robots ' souls could pass from their bodies			1
a super computer has become the first in history to pass the @entity306 , a benchmark of artificial intelligence set by codebreaker @entity308 ( pictured ) the @entity306 was introduced by @entity310 codebreaker @entity308 in 1950 as part of his paper @entity312 in which he predicted that computers would one day be programmed to acquire abilities rivalling human intelligence			1
he proposed a test called @entity317 , which would identify whether a computer is capable of thought			0
a person , called the interrogator , engages in a text based conversation with another person and a computer - and must determine which is @entity326 they are unable to do so the computer is deemed to have passed			0
in 2014 , a super computer was created which can simulate human conversation so well that it convinced people it is a teenage boy			0
the computer programme called @entity334 , developed to simulate a 13 - year - old boy , has now managed to convince 33 per cent of judges that it is human			2
professor @entity338 , from the @entity339 which organised the test , said : ‘ in the field of artificial intelligence there is no more iconic and controversial milestone than the @entity306			1
' ' i was thrilled over the interesting mismatch of giving cutting - edge technology a memorial service in a very conventional manner , ' he said			0
it is a mismatch that humans will probably become more used to over the coming years and decades , as robots with ' personalities ' become ever more part of our lives			2
later this year , @entity9 telecoms giant @entity357 says it is going to start selling the humanoid @entity358 to the public			1
despite the $ 2,000 cost , @entity358 will be useless for housework , but developers say it will learn to imitate and intuit human emotions over time			0
this blurring of lines means more people could feel the kind of attachment that @entity22 owners know so well , said @entity372 's @entity97			1
' i do n't know if people will develop affection ( towards a new generation of robots ) in five , six years ' time , ' he said			2
' but i think we need to recognise they are not ordinary electrical devices			0

some @entity9 owners of robot dog @entity22 believe their ' pets ' have souls
*manufacturer* of @entity59 discontinued product in 2006
@entity59 kept ' clinics ' open for the pets until last year for repairs
the last of these are now closed leading some owners to stage funerals
as artificial intelligence *improves* , the question of whether robots are ' alive ' or not will become more *pressing*
