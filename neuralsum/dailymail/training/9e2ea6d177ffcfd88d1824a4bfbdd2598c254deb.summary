for nearly half a century , his medals simply gathered dust in a locked drawer			2
@entity4 rarely talked about his adventures as an @entity7 ace in the @entity8 , not even with his closest family			1
but the medals told their own remarkable story			2
one was a @entity12 and @entity13 , for his acts of gallantry in the face of the enemy			1
another was the @entity20 , for an ‘ outstanding ’ devotion to duty			1
wing commander @entity24 ' @entity23 ' @entity4 was the @entity7 's most prolific night - fighter pilot of the war , claiming 21 enemy kills			1
now aged 93 ( right ) , he is suffering from @entity27 's and has been in a private care home since his wife @entity29 died last year for wing commander @entity33 – former conscientious objector , dedicated clergyman and devoted father – was the country ’s most prolific night - fighter pilot during the battle against @entity38 ’s @entity37			1
only when his grandson took an interest in the medals was the full extent of his heroism revealed			2
his @entity7 log book recorded 21 enemy kills , more than any other pilot flying night - time missions			1
but whenever he could , he aimed for the enemy plane ’s engine to give the pilot and crew a chance of survival			2
devoted husband : ' @entity23 ' with his wife @entity29 , who died last year among the other items being auctioned is @entity56 's sketch of his moonlit @entity58 flying over @entity59 @entity4 ( right ) and his navigator @entity60 ( left ) made 30 sorties over @entity59 to provide escort cover to @entity7 bombers he downed four @entity59 planes in a single sortie and saved countless lives by bringing down three @entity67 flying bombs , jet propelled aeroplanes , before they hit civilian communities in @entity71			1
but time appears to have evaporated the nation ’s debt to @entity4 , now 92 and suffering from alzheimer ’s disease			0
with much reluctance , his family is being forced to sell the medals to pay care home fees			1
yesterday veterans ’ organisations blamed politicians for forgetting the risks wing commander @entity4 and his contemporaries took and the sacrifices they made			1
one described it as ‘ a kick in the teeth ’ and added : ‘ sadly he wo n’t be the last to have to sell his medals to pay for his care			2
’ the story of how a young bible - class teacher became an unlikely fighter ace began when @entity4 , who registered as a conscientious objector at the outbreak of war , decided the best way to serve @entity99 was to fight for his country against the evil of @entity102			1
he signed up for the @entity7 shortly after turning 20 in february 1941 and was posted nine months later to @entity103 as a night - fighter pilot			1
the air ace flew @entity106 with @entity103 and his first enemy kill was in february 1944 when he shot down a @entity109 fighter plane off the @entity111 coast			2

the pair went up for a spin in @entity4 's @entity58 after the war ended @entity4 's logbook from november 1944 includes his four kills over @entity127 , western @entity59 @entity4 shot down three @entity129 88 bombers and a @entity130 near @entity131 , firing just 200 rounds in the process @entity134 , of @entity71 auctioneers @entity135 , which is selling the medal group , said : ' @entity8 produced many modest heroes who returned to civilian life and were reluctant to discuss their war - time exploits ' flying a @entity58 , the dashing young pilot excelled			1
with his navigator @entity60 he formed a duo nicknamed ‘ the night hawk partners ’ – and shot down 21 aircraft in ten months			2
the pair made 30 sorties over @entity59 to provide cover for @entity151 and @entity152 bombers			1
one of his most exciting scrapes came on the night of march 24 , 1944 , when he became embroiled in a dogfight with a @entity157			0
his @entity58 chased the aircraft from 19,000ft to 3,000ft before it crashed into the sea			0
@entity4 pulled up with only 1,000ft to spare			0
his most celebrated achievement came in november 1944 during a bombing raid over @entity164			0
with just 200 rounds , he shot down three @entity129 88 bombers and a @entity167			0
in january 1945 , he surpassed the record set by night - fighter legend @entity169 , famed for his ability to see in the dark			1
wing @entity174 's sketch of his @entity175 , an early @entity177 - built aircraft @entity4 ’s resolve to target aircraft engines rather than pilots meant that after the war , he was able to meet his chief adversary , @entity182 , whose plane he had downed			1
@entity4 happily took him for a spin in a @entity58			0
but not long afterwards , wing commander @entity4 put the war behind him			1
he studied theology at @entity188 and became a lay preacher , dedicating much of his life to helping young people			0
soon after his wife @entity29 died last year , however , it became clear his family would face a hefty bill for his care			2
now they are trying to raise £ 120,000 from the sale of his medals , enough to provide for up to six years ’ care at the ‘ brilliant ’ home where he lives			1
yesterday his son @entity204 , a 59 - year - old artistic director from @entity203 , said : ‘ we ’re reluctant to do it but we believe it is the right thing			0
he was happy to do the remarkable things he did and he survived			0
we value him more than his medals			0
‘ my father never really talked about his war experiences very much			0
it was only when my own son became interested for a school project that we sat down with @entity217 , and he took us through his log book			0
’ recently @entity4 ’s life was documented in a book , wings and a prayer			0
author @entity223 said : ‘ he was extremely modest about the whole thing			0
he never understood why he had been rewarded for something he did n’t really want to do			0
he did n’t boast about it ... just the opposite			0
whenever he shot a plane down he always used to look behind to see if the pilot had got out			0
