by @entity0 published : 14:19 est , 8 november 2013 updated : 15:39 est , 8 november 2013 as the latest series of @entity2 draws to a close , millions hang their heads in despair , envisaging months of emptiness until their beloved family of aristocrats return			2
but this time , all is not lost			0
though the @entity14 family and their servants are packing up a fourth series , viewers can now replace their upstairs - downstairs fix with a visit to the real - life manor			1
the set - @entity20 in @entity21 , @entity22 - is home to the @entity23 and @entity24 when the cameras clear off			1
but with fans clamouring for more , the family have decided to open their doors to share the space with the world			0
magnificent : the 50 - foot - tall main hall has acoustics ideal for performances from choirs or minstrel groups to entertain guests at @entity20 in @entity21 , @entity38 party venue : @entity40 , home to the @entity42 since the 17th century , was the centre of 1800s political life			1
@entity45 exclaimed ' how scenical ! ' when he visited visitors of the magnificent country house have free reign to explore the 1,000 - acre grounds - from the grandiose entrance hall to the luxurious sitting room - that have been brought to life on their tv screen			1
the main hall 's ceiling is 50 feet tall , providing perfect acoustics for performances from a choir or a group of minstrels to entertain the @entity42 ' many guests			0
servants would have to throw themselves down makeshift chutes during fire alarms as the stairs were too many to run down			0
priceless paintings lather the walls - including a portrait of @entity69 , commissioned by the king himself , hanging in the dining room behind where @entity72 sits in the series as he plays @entity14 , @entity23			1
the gold leaf - adorned sitting room - used in the show by @entity76 , the lady of the manor - glimmers with light pouring in through the windows onto @entity81 's desk , which sits discreetly in the corner			1
hit : @entity2 has reigned in millions of viewers to @entity84 every sunday night for four series as the aristocrats and servants cavort around @entity20 history : the mansion was built by sir @entity90 , architect of the @entity91 , in 1838 over a @entity93 manor			1
it now spans more than 1,000 acres upstairs - downstairs : visitors will be able to examine everything from the grand staircases to priceless paintings or the servants ' bells which have courted @entity84 viewers from the epic to the minuscule , visitors will get a glimpse into the fine details that come together to create the timely programme			1
the bells - lined up in a row downstairs to summon servants - are each slightly different , though seemingly identical			2
with time , workers would know exactly which room they were being summoned to without even looking at the bells			0
every book in the living room has been read and readers have left their own thoughts and perceptions scrawled along the pages			0
and in the cabinets , a plethora of high quality china stands on display			0
in the grounds , there is a monk garden , created during @entity127 's battle with the church as a retreat for the bishops of @entity131 - and gave the inspiration for the hit show 's name			1
originally a hill fort , @entity40 dates back to the @entity136 and has housed people for around 1300 years , according to an early @entity139 census			1
dancing : there are plenty of halls for banquets and dancing			0
according to @entity24 , the family now play games like charades in these quarters minute detail : the bedrooms - all 80 of them - each have their own design quirks , including cornice - moulded ceilings , gold leaf walls , or floor - to - floor windows many uses : during @entity158 , the manor was turned into a hospital for wounded soldiers in @entity161			1
the 5th @entity24 , inspiration for @entity76 , nursed them herself lived in : current owners , @entity165 and @entity166 , live in the manor most of the year with their son			1
they have photos all over of ancestors or them with royals documentation from the late 1700s show the first signs of the @entity24 family , who started with some major rebuilding works			0
they converted the old brick and freestone house into a classical @entity93 mansion			0
but a couple of decades later , they went a step further			0
in 1848 , the third @entity182 commissioned sir @entity90 , who built the @entity91 , to transform his estate into a mansion			1
it was a project that would last 30 years and , once built , the manor became the centre of 19th century political life			1
on screen : the library makes for a dimly - lit setting for heart - wrenching talks as the characters wade through emotional battles and financial deals grand : every exquisitely - bound book on the shelves has been read - with thoughts and perceptions left scrawled on the dusty pages gold : the columns of the library - like much of the castle - are decorated in gold			2
the @entity42 have admitted they needed to get some parts repainted after filming peek inside : people can pay to see the entire castle , grounds and gardens with the top band ticket			1
cheaper tickets - £ 5 - are offered for garden - only tours @entity218 parties beckoned leading politicians , innovators , aviators , soldiers , and explorers			1
@entity45 exclaimed ' how scenical ! how scenical ! ' on first seeing the re-named and re-modelled ' @entity20 '			2
but the party venue would soon become a makeshift hospital as the @entity158 took over the nation			0
patients began to arrive from @entity161 from september 1914 - and the 5th @entity24 , @entity229 ( the inspiration for the character , @entity76 ) , nursed the wounded herself			2
the @entity2 : the name for @entity234 ' show stems from the creation of a monk garden in the grounds during @entity127 's battle with the church full : during filming , at least 90 crew members and the entire cast take over the manor , using every opulent room for their day - to - day work , including this drawing room inspired : @entity76 , the lady of the manor , is based on @entity249 , the 5th countess who welcomed in soldiers and nursed them during @entity252 during the @entity252 , a few evacuee children from north @entity254 were taken in , but by and large it returned to being a private home			1
the limelight then turned to the inhabitants : in 1923 , the 5th @entity23 - a leading egyptologist - rewrote history by discovering @entity258 's grave			2
his premature death six weeks later at the age of 56 shook the nation , filled headlines - and left the family in thousands of pounds of debt			2
but , like @entity269 's death in @entity2 , the family struggled through and managed to keep hold of their grand home and out of the newspapers			0
decoration : crests adorn the walls of the saloon , which is a focal point of the show			0
servants had to jump down chutes during fire alarms to escape the giant hall home : @entity165 , the 8th @entity284 , pictured at his home ( left ) , and wife @entity166 ( right )			0
his great - grandfather , the 5th @entity23 , discovered @entity288 's grave almost 100 years later , @entity2 put @entity40 on the map again			2
@entity290 , now the 7th countess of the manor , wrote a book about the history using their extensive archives			0
scriptwriter @entity234 , a close friend of the @entity42 ' , used it as both the inspiration and the setting for his award - winning @entity84 drama			1
four series in , film crews and costume designers take over the castle for months at a time , creating the heady world of butlers and balls and upstairs - downstairs shenanigans presided over by @entity72 and @entity309			2
outdoors : the @entity23 ( played by @entity72 ) is fond of a cricket match or drinks event on the lawn of the @entity38 estate ‘ initially we thought it would be a bit of fun and might help our marketing , ’ says 49 - year - old @entity24			2
( after all , the house has ‘ between 50 and 80 ’ bedrooms to maintain			0
) ‘ we had no idea it would be so successful			0
’ she and @entity323 live at @entity20 with their 14 - year - old son @entity324 ( @entity326 also has two grown - up children from his first marriage ) while filming continues around them			1
but they share the national - and now , worldwide - obsession with the fictional family that inhabits their historic house on sunday evenings			0
‘ we always sit down at 9 o’clock for @entity2 , ’ says @entity24			0
‘ it ’s very odd seeing them on the television in a particular part of the castle when you ’re sitting ten yards away			0
’ they will welcome visitors into their home from december , offering tickets from £ 5 to £ 55 for a tour of the notorious grounds .			1

people can *buy* tickets to have a tour of @entity20 in @entity21 , @entity22 , which was built in 1838

the manor in its current form was created by sir @entity90 , who designed the @entity91
