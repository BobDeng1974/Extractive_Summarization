when @entity2 's teenage mother was punched in the face by a partner while holding her infant daughter , little @entity0 did n't cry			2
by then , she had become used to such violence			0
as the first phase of an inquest into the @entity12 girl 's death drew to a close on friday , there could be no doubt @entity0 's short life was also marred by appalling squalor and neglect			1
government agency @entity18 considered her to be at risk even before she was born and had received multiple calls about the girl by the time she was six weeks old			1
after 20 notifications were made to the child protection agency about @entity0 's care , she was never removed from her drug - using mother , @entity27			1
@entity0 was four years old when she died of massive head injuries in january 2012 after being forced to ride a motorbike and repeatedly crashed over a three - day period in her @entity12 backyard			1
evidence has revealed how @entity27 , described by one concerned friend as a very convincing liar , was often given the benefit of the doubt by social workers , who helped clean her house and avoided confronting the teenager about her drug use			0
one of the squalid residences she and @entity0 occupied was reportedly infested with rats , while another was littered with soiled nappies and rotting food			0
it was alleged @entity0 was also left for days on end with @entity27 's teenage friends			2
the reaction of state coroner @entity58 and his counsel to the evidence was one of disbelief			0
social worker @entity63 told the inquest he helped @entity27 draft a safety plan in late 2007 to make sure infant @entity0 received proper care when her mother was affected by drugs			1
@entity27 , who was 16 at the time , agreed that whenever she and her then - partner were out of it there would be a sober person at home			0
the strategy replaced a previous agreement , brokered by case workers , in which @entity27 pledged to cease all drug - taking			0
an inquest into @entity0 's death heard that social workers knew that her mother , drug user @entity82 , was neglecting her daughter from 18 - months - old the coroner questioned why mr @entity63 would muddy the waters , saying the new plan had effectively condoned @entity27 's drug use			1
' it does n't in any way start with discouragement not to use drugs , does it ? ' mr @entity58 asked			0
' it 's almost implicit that they will use drugs			0
' another social worker , @entity96 , told the inquest @entity27 was ' just a teenager ' who found it difficult to prioritise tasks such as cleaning her rubbish - strewn house			2
@entity0 died at the hands of her parents after she was repeatedly forced to crash a motorbike over a three - day period counsel assisting the coroner , @entity106 , accused ms @entity96 of defending @entity27 's behaviour , saying her obligation was to protect infant @entity0			1
' she was a teenager with a baby , ' ms @entity106 said			0
' you 're there to protect the baby , not make excuses for the mother , are n't you ? ' social worker @entity96 told the inquest on wednesday she believed 18 - month - old @entity0 was receiving ' good enough ' care in early 2009 , despite substantial evidence of neglect and multiple child abuse notifications , when her mother was 17			1
@entity0 's teenage mother allowed the 18 - month - old to be supervised by other teenagers for extended periods , despite being warned by ms @entity96 that this was not acceptable			2
family members , including @entity27 's father , raised alarms about infant @entity0 's safety and told agencies they would be happy to take care of the girl if she was removed from her mother			2
but ms @entity96 believed some of the allegations may have been malicious or exaggerated because there was ' frequent conflict ' in @entity27 's family relationships			2
@entity27 was ' just a teenager ' and found it difficult to prioritise tasks such as cleaning her often rubbish - strewn house , ms @entity96 said			0
@entity27 , was jailed for at least four years and nine months while the 22 - year - old 's then - partner , @entity144 , 28 , received four years and two months @entity0 died of 39 different injuries in 2012 ms @entity96 denied that she was reluctant to act on the child abuse allegations , saying it took time for parents such as @entity27 to make sustained changes			1
@entity27 , now 22 , and a later partner , @entity144 , 28 , were jailed this year over @entity0 's death after pleading guilty to manslaughter through criminal neglect			1
the inquest will resume for another two weeks on december 1 .			0
