by @entity0 published : 06:10 est , 17 april 2012 updated : 06:31 est , 17 april 2012 @entity2 's billionaire co-founders celebrated their firm 's mega-money sale to @entity5 by partying the night away at a @entity7 superclub - with a picture posted on their app to prove it			1
@entity12 @entity11 and @entity13 , who last week sold their photo - sharing service for a staggering $ 1billion , ' rocked out ' as details of their deal continued to sink in			1
pictured at dinner with superstar djs and producers @entity22 and @entity23 at @entity24 and @entity27 ' @entity26 restaurant , the pair then moved on to the celebrity haunt of @entity27 's @entity30 nightclub			0
posted : @entity2 's co-founders @entity11 ( centre top ) and @entity13 ( right ) with club managing partner @entity33 ( left bottom ) , @entity22 ( top left ) and @entity23 ( bottom right ) they were said to be clearly enjoying the limelight as the club 's managing partner @entity33 appropriately posted a picture of the group via their app. but their antics all looked a bit tame , especially considering they have now entered into the league of the ' super-rich '			1
there was no suggestion the 26 - year - olds splashed out $ 150,000 on the world 's biggest bottle of champagne , the 30litre @entity54 '			1
and it seems they did n't blow $ 3,000 on a private table at the venue - a favourite for , among others , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 and @entity64			0
they even went to bed on saturday morning at a relatively early 4am , after sneaking backstage to watch @entity23 in action			1
but maybe they were just tired , having capped a remarkable seven days			0
plush : the upmarket @entity30 nightclub , in @entity27 , is a favourite for countless celebrities luxurious : private tables cost around $ 3,000 per night and clients can spend $ 150,000 on the world 's biggest bottle of champagne @entity5 boss @entity78 announced last week he would hand over $ 1billion to buy the company			1
the app , which allows users to alter and post images on their smartphones and tablets , will be paid for in cash and @entity5 stock			1
@entity5 will complete its initial public offering of stock next month			1
the service - used by 30 million people , including celebrities @entity90 , @entity92 and @entity93 - is increasingly becoming a rival for @entity5 , which also relies on people posting pictures			1
the deal comes just days after the service began offering a version for @entity101 phones in addition to its popular @entity104 app. interestingly , it also comes eight years after @entity106 turned down @entity78 's offer to join the @entity5 team in 2004 - before it shot to success			1
party time : the @entity2 co-founders watched a set by @entity23 during their night out in @entity27 big spender : @entity5 owner @entity78 , far left , paid @entity2 co-founders , @entity11 ( pictured right ) and @entity13 ( next to him ) $ 1 billion for their popular photo - sharing app mr @entity78 said he would keep @entity2 running separately and users will still be able to use it on rival social networks , such as @entity119 - yet experts predict the deal could be the death of the app. @entity5 has had a tendency to buy small startups and integrate the technology - or shut it down altogether			1
one thing is certain , @entity2 's co-founders have now joined the leagues of the super-rich			0
both are @entity132 graduates , yet did not meet at university			0
instead , their paths crossed after @entity135 , who had worked for @entity137 's @entity136 and a start - up that went on to become @entity119 , created a photo sharing app called @entity140			0
@entity13 was an early @entity141 user and reached out to the creator			1
as the ceo , @entity106 is the more vocal of the duo , appearing as the face of the company to laud the application 's simplicity and sociability			0
popular : @entity2 is a photo - sharing application that allows users to crop images and give them different filters throughout university , he developed two main interests - food and photography - with his @entity5 profile boasting evidence of both			1
yet it was the photography angle he chose to develop , creating services that made photo sharing easier , even as just an 18 - year - old undergraduate			0
but he has not entirely abandoned his love of food , taking photographs of long cooking sessions , enjoying a recent dinner with @entity172 chef @entity171 , and admitting on @entity5 that ' champagne ' is one of his favourite things ( and he 'll be able to afford a few extra bottles now )			2
both men 's profiles hint that they enjoy the finer things in life - @entity106 , who was in fraternity @entity181 while at university , listing bowties and corduroy among his interests , while @entity13 is pictured alongside vintage cars - and during a recent meeting with @entity188			2
fan : @entity190 is one of its celebrity users			0
here she created a sepia - tinted pose of her with a coconut and now the co-founders will be able treat themselves - as will the venture capital firm @entity196 who invested early and now owns an extremely lucrative portion of the company			0
the @entity132 graduates met each when @entity11 , then working for @entity137 , set up a photo sharing service @entity140			2
fifteen months ago they founded @entity2			0
on the company blog , @entity11 wrote how he and his team are ' psyched ' about the deal			2
he also reassured users that @entity5 would not stop the @entity2 app - instead it will continue to exist independently of @entity5			2
' @entity2 is not going away , ' he wrote			0
' we ’ll be working with @entity5 to evolve @entity2 and build the network			2
' we ’ll continue to add new features to the product and find new ways to create a better mobile photos experience			0
the @entity2 app will still be the same one you know and love			0
' we ’re psyched to be joining @entity5 and are excited to build a better @entity2 for everyone			2

but night out looked a bit tame , as pair were *tucked* up in bed by 4am
@entity11 and @entity13 , both 26 , sold firm to @entity5 for $ *1bn*
