companies run by women performed almost three times as well than those run by men , according to a new study			2
cash invested only in @entity8 stocks from companies with female ceos had a return of 348 per cent over the past 12 years , researchers found			1
in the same period of time , a portfolio made up of stocks from the @entity17 index would have returned just 122 per cent			0
the discovery was made by finance technology company @entity19 , which ran two imaginary $ 100,000 investment funds using stock data from 2002 - 2014			1
bringing home the bacon : a study found that @entity8 companies with female ceos produced returns of 348 per cent from 2002 to 2014 , as shown in green on the graph above			1
for comparison , the s&p500 index , in blue , had a return of 122 per cent in the same period top of the pile : @entity35 , ceo of @entity37 ( left ) , @entity38 of @entity39 ( center ) and @entity41 of @entity42 ( right ) all brought in substantial returns for shareholders during their tenures at the end of the experiment , the women 's fund was calculated to be worth $ 440,158 , while the @entity51 fund was at $ 222,306			1
the women 's fund would hold stocks by all @entity8 companies with female ceos for as long as the woman was at the head of the company			1
it would sell the stock whenever a woman left the top spot , and buy in to new companies which appointed women			0
fewer than one in 20 major companies currently has a female ceo			2
according to a report by @entity67 , the best performers were @entity37 , which runs the home shopping network , and @entity39 , a healthcare company which runs housing estates for the elderly			0
@entity37 has been run by @entity35 since 2006 , and @entity39 by @entity38 for the whole 12 - year period - both women returned more than 500 per cent on initial investments			1
other high - performing female ceos were @entity41 at @entity42 , @entity75 at @entity76 and @entity77 at @entity78 , a homeware and clothing retailer			1
some women dragged the pack down , however , including @entity84 ceo @entity83 , whose eight - year tenure saw the company shed 80 per cent of its worth			1
there is no definitive explanation for why female ceos apparently bring in so much more cash for investors			2
it has been suggested that typically female personality traits make for better corporate leaders			0
@entity95 , ceo of @entity96 , has made 70 per cent of his executives female			0
he told @entity98 : ' emotional intelligence is the key to being really successful			0
people who have it keep their egos in check ; they 're comfortable with surrounding themselves with people better than them ... ' however , it has also been suggested that female leaders can feel pressure more than male counterparts			0
@entity35 , one of the best - performing female ceos of recent times , told @entity112 that high - powered women are more at risk of burning out , too			1
she said : ' being female , i ’d say we have tendencies to want to be perfect at everything in every moment of everyday			0
the challenge is understanding how to allocate your time personally and professionally , and remembering you have to be a person too			0
' keeping on : @entity77 , head of homeware and clothing retailer @entity78 , brought good returns for shareholders too			0
an exception to the rule was @entity132 ceo @entity83 , who lost investors some 80 per cent of their cash @entity135 , ceo at @entity136 also lost investors ' money in her tenure from 2006 - 08			0
@entity140 , who helped build the simulation , said she believes the results are because of the so - called ' glass ceiling ' holding women back from big jobs			0
the result , she said , is that any women who wants to lead a huge company must be extremely competent - and so good financial performance follows			1
she told @entity8 : ' there ’s a lot of the theorizing around why the results are dramatically higher for the women , but most think it has to do with how hard women have to work to become ceo at such big companies in the first place '			1
however , it has also been theorized that the results are also affected by the types of companies women have typically led - media , retail and consumer organizations - which benefited greatly in the recent economic upturn			2
the female - only index also crashed more steeply than the @entity17 during the 2008 - 09 recession , but remained worth more overall throughout - and rallied more strongly afterward .			2

finance technology company *plotted* how companies with female ceos performed from 2002 to 2014
imagined $ 100,000 was invested in @entity8 companies led by women , vs performance of s&p500 index
women 's index was *ultimately* worth $ 440,158 - return of 348 **%** - while the other was worth $ 222,306 , a 122 **%** return
high performing female ceos included @entity42 's @entity41 and @entity37 's @entity35
expert who ran experiment suggested results are because only most competent women make ceo
