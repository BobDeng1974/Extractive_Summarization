an amateur space enthusiast hoped to have finally discovered life on @entity2 after spotting what looked like a crocodile roaming the red planet			1
unfortunately , the jawed beast spotted by keen - eyed amateur astronomer @entity7 , from @entity8 , was nothing more than a chuck of rock			1
@entity12 has been beaming photos from space since mobile robot @entity15 landed there in august 2012			0
an amateur space enthusiast hoped to have finally discovered life on @entity2 after spotting what looked like a crocodile roaming the red planet the chunks of rock bore an uncanny resemblance to the long jaws of a crocodile mr @entity7 , 45 , a space video journalist , has been eagerly watching the images for signs of alien life			1
but he has been more successful at spotting familiar items in the rock formation			2
he said : ' i was playing another game of ' interplanetary i spy when i found the crocodile looking thing just sitting there on @entity2			1
' compare the nose and mouth morphology			0
' mr @entity7 runs the @entity44 channel @entity45 and trawls through @entity12 's images every day to find unusual shapes			2
the image was shot from the six - foot - high right hand side mast cam on the @entity15 earlier this year			2
there have been rocks that look like traffic lights , and even a perfectly rounded stone discovered on the surface of @entity2			1
another of the latest bizarre formations appears to show a rock in the shape of a cannon			0
@entity12 has been beaming photos from @entity2 since its @entity15 landed in august 2012			1
another picture appears to show a cannon ( pictured left ) mr @entity7 said : ' i think it looks like a gun - as in an artillery piece - but it 's way too small for that really			0
' last month , a perfectly rounded rock was also spotted on the @entity2 surface , and continuing the cannon analogy , it looks similar to a cannonball			1
the rover 's top speed is 1.5 inches ( 3.8 centimetres ) per second			0
curiosity is the fourth rover to visit @entity2			1
it took around seven minutes to land on the @entity2			2
the rover is fitted with 17 cameras			0
it weighs about the same as a @entity84 at approximately 900kg ( 2,000lbs )			0
scientists considered 60 possible landing sites before deciding on @entity87			0
the same week , a rock shaped like a traffic light was also spotted as @entity15 roamed around the base of @entity2 ' @entity91			1
in the image , a set of three large rocks - admittedly with a larger fourth one as well - are shown being stacked on top of each other			0
they bear a striking resemblance to traffic lights on @entity100			0
but it ’s highly unlikely this same feature was built by a martian civilisation			0
the image was shot from the six - foot ( 1.8 metre ) high , left - hand side mast cam on the @entity15			0
the ' traffic light ' rock was also spotted by mr @entity7 , who runs a @entity44 channel called @entity45			1
‘ i saw this one and i thought “ hang on , that looks a bit strange ”			0
i think it looks like a traffic light			1
‘ it is hard to tell how big it would be without any point of reference , but i would estimate it was about 12 inches [ 30.5cm ]			0
‘ i posted it on the internet and people said they thought it looked like a set of traffic lights too - although some people did say it looked like a totem pole			2
’ the curiosity rover recently spotted a rock that looks like traffic lights on @entity2 ( shown in the red ring in this image )			1
@entity133 - based @entity12 is yet to comment on the latest discovery			0
the finding highlights just how weird and wonderful some of the rock formations on @entity2 can be the ' traffic lights ' ( left ) were spotted by @entity15 ( right ) on its way to the base of @entity91 , a geologically fascinating region that could explain how @entity2 lost its wet and habitable environment			1
other people have said the strange looking rock resembles a totem pole the rock was spotted by space video journalist @entity7			2
mr @entity7 said : ' i saw this one and i thought " hang on , that looks a bit strange "			0
i think it looks like a traffic light ' ( stock image shown )			1
the image from @entity15 is just one of many fascinating rocks on the red planet that resembles something we are familiar with on @entity100 just days earlier , @entity15 spotted the ball - shaped rock on the surface of @entity2			1
@entity12 said it was likely an example of @entity2 concretion , the process of compacting and hardening a mass of matter , according to @entity169			2
curiosity is currently at the base of @entity91 , which has been the target for the mission since it landed just over two years ago			1
the area is geologically fascinating as it contains layers that may provide an insight into the history of @entity2			2
and , scientists hope the region might reveal how and why @entity2 lost what was once thought to be a habitable environment , with water flowing on its surface			1
this , in turn , may provide answers on the future of @entity100			0
the discovery follows another intriguing image that showed an almost perfectly round rock on the @entity183 ( shown )			1
@entity12 said it was likely an example of @entity2 concretion , the process of compacting and hardening a mass of matter			2
continuing the cannon analogy , it also looks like a cannonball			0

the curiosity rover has spotted a rock that looks like a crocodile on @entity2
@entity204 follows other intriguing images that showed an almost perfectly rounded stone , and a traffic light - shaped rock on the @entity2 surface
curiosity is currently at the base of @entity91 on the red planet
