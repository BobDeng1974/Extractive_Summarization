pccs were elected in 41 police forces in @entity27 and @entity28 in november and each one has control over the budget and policing priorities in their area			1
ministers say they will make the police more accountable but critics claim they are a waste of money and could undermine the police ’s political independence			1
a spokesman for the @entity43 ’ @entity41 said : ‘ it ’s always great to see people getting involved in the fight against crime in their communities			2
‘ but paying this youth @entity49 a salary and giving her expenses like this is a ridiculous waste of money and nothing more than expensive tokenism			1
’ and @entity56 , conservative mp for @entity57 , said : ‘ if the elected police and crime commissioner ca n’t do her job of protecting young people and she has to pay a 17 - year - old £ 15,000 a year , i hope it is coming out of her own salary , ‘ if she ’s incapable of going out and speaking to young people herself then that does n’t say a great deal about her			1

she applied for the job while working as an apprentice for her local council and living at home on the @entity81 with her parents and three brothers			2
last night she said the job would help her be the ‘ messenger ’ for young people in @entity9			2
and she has vowed to change perceptions of young people to show that most of them are ‘ lovely ’ and not threatening hoodies			2
she said : ‘ the only reason young people hang around on the street is because there ’s nothing else for them to do			2
‘ i ’m going to be going out and asking them what things they need to get them off the streets			2
one of the things i want to do is help to remove the stigma young people have attached to them			2
@entity10 will work alongside commissioner @entity22 after she pledged in her manifesto to appoint a youth counterpart ‘ when people see a young person in a hoodie they think they ’ve got to stay away from them – but actually most young people are lovely if you give them the time			1
’ she added : ‘ i ’m just like any other girl my age			0
i like doing normal teenage stuff like going to the cinema with friends and playing on the computer			0
‘ i ’m really excited			0
i know i ’m only 16 , but i really do think i can make a difference			0
' @entity10 , from @entity119 , @entity9 , was one of 164 applicants for the job miss @entity2 , who is currently an apprentice official at @entity123 , will take up the commissioner role in the summer			1

at school she would always stand up for someone she thought was being picked on or getting a hard time			0
‘ she ’s had a very stable , normal upbringing			0
she ’s never been in trouble and neither have her three brothers thank goodness			0
' we ’ve taught them wrong from right			0
’ mrs @entity22 is using £ 5,000 from her own salary to pay the cost of the post , with the remaining £ 10,000 coming from her staffing budget			1
she said : ‘ young people do n’t have much of a voice in policing in @entity9 and i ’m determined to change that			0
‘ young people are victims of crime and also perpetrators of crime			0
they are often forgotten or demonised and that should n’t be the case – they are our young citizens and we need to listen to them			0
‘ @entity10 is going to be the young face of policing in the county and i ’m quite sure she is going to do a brilliant job at helping the police to connect with young people			1
’ mrs @entity22 said commissioners in other parts of the country had suggested they may introduce similar posts .			0

her salary will be paid for out of the police budget
idea behind appointing ms @entity2 is help police ' stay in touch ' with the youth
