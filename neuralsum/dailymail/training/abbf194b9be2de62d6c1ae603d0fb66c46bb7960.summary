president @entity20 expressed concern at doing just that on thursday and again called on @entity5 's government to come together to fight the common treat to their nation			1
he also fired a warning shot at @entity265			0
the @entity1 welcome 's the country to play a ' constructive role ' in @entity5 , he said , but ' if @entity265 is coming in solely as an armed force on behalf of the @entity48 , and it is framed in that fashion , that probably worsens the situation			1
