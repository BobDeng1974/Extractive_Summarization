the widening gap between @entity3 's wealthiest and its middle and lower classes is ' unsustainable ' , but is unlikely to improve any time soon , according to a @entity5 study released on monday			1
@entity3 companies , especially big ones , were showing some signs of recovering their competitive edge on the world stage since the financial crisis , but workers are continuing to struggle to demand better pay and benefits , according to the study , titled , ' an economy doing half its job '			1
the report focuses on this ' troubling divergence ' between the rally at large and mid-size firms and the challenge smaller companies and middle - and working - class @entity3 are having keeping up			1
this graph from the @entity5 study shows almost half of respondents to its survey forecast falling competitiveness over the coming three years although a plurality of respondents remain pessimistic about the @entity3 ' prospects , the percentage has dropped significantly from recent surveys overall the survey showed improvement in every measure of the @entity3 business environment from prior years ' we argue that such a divergence is unsustainable , ' lead authors @entity41 and @entity43 write in the report , which was based on a survey of 1,947 of @entity5 alumni around the globe , and which highlighted problems with the @entity3 education system , transport infrastructure and the effectiveness of the political system			1
' how can we create a @entity3 economy in which firms both thrive in global competition and lift the living standards of the average @entity3 ? ' the study 's authors ask in the executive summary			1
some 47 per cent of respondents in the survey said that overthe next three years they expected @entity3 companies to be bothless competitive internationally and less able to pay higherwages and benefits , versus 33 per cent who thought the opposite			1
that contrasts with the more troubling trends in the labor market and among middle - and working - class @entity3 the job market for younger @entity3 is particularly troubled , with the share of ' mal - employed ' college graduates soaring in recent years the results marked an improvement from a 2012 @entity5 survey of its alumni showing 58 per cent of respondents expecting a decline in @entity3 competitiveness , according to the survey			1
in k - 12 education , business is mostly involved in fragmented , subscale efforts that alleviate weaknesses in the system without strengthening it for the long run			0
in workplace skills , firms tend to hire in ways that discourage skills investments ; information flows poorly along the ' supply chain ' for talent ; and there is inadequate collaboration among companies , educational institutions and government			2
in transportation infrastructure , there is no national strategy for increasing both the nation 's mobility and the opportunity that accompanies it			0
the change from 2011 was even more stark , when 71 per cent forecast a decline			0
respondents were more favorable in every element of the @entity3 business environment , reflecting the cyclical rebound of the economy , the authors said			2
smaller gains were seen in areas that pose ' some of the nation 's toughest challenges ' , including the tax code , the education system , the political system and regulations			2
but the authors of the @entity5 survey noted that respondents of the 2014 survey ' were much more hopeful about the future competitive success of @entity3 's firms than they were about the future pay of @entity3 's workers '			1
@entity133 reported weakness in areas that drive the prospects of middle - and working - class @entity3 , such as in education , the quality of workplace skills and the effectiveness of the political system			0
household incomes in the lower and middle classes have remained stagnant in inflation - adjusted terms for decades , while private sector job growth rates are subdued , the authors said			0
this chart shows the areas where the @entity3 is seen as improving relative to other advanced economies and areas where its standing is deteriorating , and how it 's changed from prior surveys they called on corporate leaders to help solve @entity3 's wealth gap by working to buttress the kindergarten - to - 12th - grade education system , skills - training programs , and transportation infrastructure , among other things			1
' shortsighted executives may be satisfied with an @entity3 economy whose firms win in global markets without lifting @entity3 living standards			2
but any leader with a long view understands that business has a profound stake in the prosperity of the average @entity3 , ' according to the report			0
' thriving citizens become more productive employees , more willing consumers , and stronger supporters of pro-business policies , ' it said			0
' struggling citizens are disgruntled at work , frugal at the cash register , and anti-business at the ballot box			0
' the study highlights the @entity3 economy 's slow recovery , record corporate profits and the growing confidence among business leaders			2
the authors noted , however , that @entity3 's international competitiveness is linked to high and rising living standards among average citizens			1
if they fall , then so too will the @entity3 ' place in the world			0
' but oddly , the recovery makes this a decisive moment , and potentially a dangerous one , ' the authors said			0
' will we as a society now sigh in relief and continue business as usual , grateful for calmer waters ? or will we seize the opportunity to repair the structural weaknesses in our economy that the storms revealed and that , arguably , brought on recent troubles and may bring them on again ? '			0

large @entity3 companies are recovering from the @entity211 , while smaller firms and workers continued to struggle , according to a @entity5 study
about 47 per cent of respondents to the study 's survey said they expected the @entity3 to be less competitive internationally and less able to pay higher wages over the coming three years , an improvement from 2012
respondents ' were much more hopeful about the future competitive success of @entity3 's firms than they were about the future pay of @entity3 's workers '
