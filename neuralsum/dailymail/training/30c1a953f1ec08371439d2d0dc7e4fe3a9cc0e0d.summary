with his pinstripe suit , big cigar and @entity3 he could almost be a @entity4 mobster rather than prime minister			2
the @entity6 seized on this wartime photograph of @entity8 to claim the great leader was no more than the kind of gangster who favoured the @entity14 submachine gun			1
but @entity8 ’s purpose in posing for the picture was as deadly as the weapon he is carrying which , remarkably , has almost certainly been found after being thought lost following the @entity19			1
this photo was taken in 1940 when he visited troops to raise morale as the country appeared to be on the brink of invasion by @entity38			2
many were calling for peace talks with the @entity6 in the face of the apparently unstoppable @entity43 invasion of @entity44			0
but @entity8 ordered that @entity30 would fight on and toured the country to rally the forces manning defences			1
it was while inspecting troops near @entity50 in july 1940 that @entity8 posed with the @entity3			1
the inspirational image survives , but the iconic weapon was thought to have disappeared – until now			1
a museum in @entity54 has laid claim to uncovering the gun which it received as part of a batch of more than 700 weapons for display from the @entity62			1
@entity8 ’s @entity3 can now be seen as part of the @entity64 at the @entity26 in @entity27			1
the @entity65 shows weapons used and captured by the @entity67 during the 19th and 20th centuries @entity69 in @entity70 is the main weapons centre for the armed forces where used firearms are refurbished , sold or scrapped			0
the @entity65 shows weapons used and captured by the @entity67 during the 19th and 20th centuries			0
@entity24 , military historian at the musuem , has painstakingly researched the @entity8 @entity3 and is confident it is the one in the picture			1
he said : ‘ the gun came to @entity78 from @entity79 in the first batch sent in early 1940 which were used for propaganda purposes			1
- a fully automatic @entity14 submachine gun can fire up to 900 rounds per minute			2
- designed by @entity79 general @entity14 , it was meant to replace the unwieldy rifle in @entity87 trenches , but production did n’t start until after the war			0
- the @entity79 postal service was an early customer – staff used the guns to fend off robbers			0
its ease of use also made it the weapon of choice for @entity101 - era gangsters			2
- nicknames , apart from @entity3 after its designer , included the ‘ @entity4 typewriter ’ because of the hammering sound when fired			0
- one believed to have been owned by @entity107 sold at auction in 2012 for £ 84,000			0
- the round magazine made them awkward to hide so mobsters carried them in violin cases			0
@entity114 hitman @entity113 kept his among his golf clubs , earning himself the nickname @entity117			0
- they were used during the @entity119 ( 1922 - 23 ) after being supplied by @entity79 sympathisers of independence , and also saw action in @entity123			0
- more than 2.7million are thought to have been made			2
- @entity125 held one during the @entity19 and remarked on how light it was			2
‘ when we realised we had it here in our possession it was an incredible feeling			0
the picture inspired the @entity30 people as it was @entity8 saying ‘ ‘ i will fight for this country in its darkest hour ’ ’			1
the guns were moved around the country for photographs to give the impression that the troops were all carrying them but in reality there were only about 400 in the country			0
’ the museum holds two of the four thought to remain from that first batch			2
mr @entity24 added : ‘ i am about 80 per cent certain it is the @entity8 @entity3			1
the gun he held would have been looked after and passed on to @entity69			1
it is difficult to say for certain , but it is more likely to be than not			0

@entity8 held the gun to inspire beleaguered @entity30 *soldiers*
image survives , but the iconic weapon was thought to have disappeared
but it can now be seen at @entity26 in @entity54
it received the weapon among 700 passed on from the @entity62
