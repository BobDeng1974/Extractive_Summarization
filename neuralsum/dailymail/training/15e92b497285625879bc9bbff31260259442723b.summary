by @entity0 the @entity1 at @entity2 next year appeared the perfect place for @entity4 to wave goodbye , stopping — like the legends before him — on the @entity7 for the obligatory farewell photo of a lifetime			1
but , in news that will come as a bitter disappointment to his vast army of admirers , i can reveal it wo n’t be happening for the two - time @entity18 winner , owing to an ugly dispute that reflects badly on the game			2
the 59 - year - old @entity21 great , never one to pull his punches , said : ‘ if you want the truth , i ’ve played in my last @entity1 and it ’s all down to the way the @entity27 and the @entity28 have handled my whole situation			1
wrangle : @entity4 will not play at @entity30 this year icon : @entity4 and his wife @entity32 back in 1993 as the @entity21 claims his second @entity18 spot the difference : @entity4 kisses the trophy in 1986 ( left ) and in 1993 ( right ) ‘ it has left a pretty sour taste in my mouth , a bad feeling after what i have done in the game			1
i ’ve nothing against the @entity42 and the @entity28 but , quite frankly , the way they go about their business is not the way i do it			1
’ what on earth would cause the @entity50 to bite such lumps out of the two bodies ? it all concerns the intense rivalry between watch companies @entity55 and @entity56 , both big players in golf			2
such is their competitiveness that @entity4 , who represents @entity56 , reckons @entity55 kept him out of playing in the pro-am for the @entity1 — an event they sponsor — in 2012 over a @entity64 course where he had walked away from the field in the @entity1 in 1986 ( @entity55 deny this )			1
a month later , @entity4 was at @entity67 and planned to be present to hear his friend , @entity71 captain @entity70 ’s wildcards announcement			1
again , @entity55 were heavily involved and , again , @entity4 believes he was denied entry			1
now , he says he has had enough			0
instead of meeting up with friends in @entity74 and @entity75 and playing in the @entity1 at @entity76 and the @entity77 at @entity78 in july , he will retire with his wife @entity79 to his holiday ranch in @entity81			0
the big losers in all of this , of course , are the fans			0
one of the great sights in recent @entity1 history came at @entity88 in 2008 when thousands of people followed the halfway leader @entity4 on his improbable quest to win a third @entity18 at the age of 53			1
a grand farewell at @entity2 , the last @entity1 for which he will be eligible , appeared ideal			0
how ironic this act of perfect timing looks like being sabotaged by a watch dispute			0
let ’s hope some wise heads at the @entity42 and the @entity28 can resolve it , for @entity4 ’s inestimable contribution to recent @entity1 lore deserves a fitting finale			1
in line : @entity4 is one of the game 's greats but will not be at the @entity1 nervous wait : @entity4 and his caddy take a break during the final round of the 1986 tournament in @entity64 picture perfect : @entity4 tees off at the ninth hole in @entity113 , @entity74 putt your money on @entity116 early tips for the masters , now just three weeks away ? you could do worse than have a sneaky pound or two on former winner @entity121 and major champion - in - waiting , @entity123 ’ll know all about their length on an @entity127 course offering the big bombers a huge advantage			1
but how about their ability to cope on those lightning - paced greens ? in waiting : @entity133 could be in line to pick up the green jacket in three weeks ' time job done : @entity121 won the tournament back in 2012 and will be gunning for another one well , the two men who currently stand miles clear of the rest on the @entity141 this year when it comes to the longest streaks without a three - putt , at 237 and 217 holes respectively , just happen to be @entity121 and @entity133			2
‘ it feels good to win again after seven years			0
a lot of good things are going to follow			0
’ @entity21 @entity148 had to end a victory drought going back to 2006 to make it to the masters and that ’s exactly what he did on sunday , holding off the likes of @entity155 to win the latest event on the @entity158 swing			1
how many players win professional events at the age of 17 ? @entity162 is the only one to have done so on the @entity28 and did it twice for good measure			2
@entity165 achieved similar things in @entity167 and then there ’s the extraordinary new zealander @entity169 , who broke all records in winning at the age of only 15			0
this , therefore , is the company of prodigies @entity175 starlet @entity174 is keeping with her maiden success on the @entity178 on sunday			0
@entity179 shot 62 in the final round of the @entity181 in @entity182 , to catch the experienced @entity184 player @entity183 , and then birdied the first extra hole to beat her in the play - off			0
sealed with a kiss : @entity162 won the @entity188 in 2010 record breaker : new zealander @entity169 with the @entity193 women 's @entity191 trophy @entity195 quality : @entity174 won the @entity181 in @entity182 this month the @entity197 starlet will celebrate her 18th on thursday , having rounded off a memorable year that saw her turn pro and promptly finish runner - up in each of her first five starts			2
she then became the youngest participant to compete in the @entity203 last august , where she proved one of the stars of @entity207 ’s historic first success on @entity209 soil			0
with an historic @entity211 not far away and so much more , what wonders the photogenic @entity179 is going to do for women ’s golf in the @entity213 .			0

@entity4 says he has played his last open championship
@entity21 legend , 59 , blasts @entity27 and @entity28
he says : ' the way they go about their business is not the way i do it '
@entity227 , who to tip for this year 's masters crown at @entity127
