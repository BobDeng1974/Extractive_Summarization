by @entity0 published : 20:52 est , 1 january 2013 updated : 20:55 est , 1 january 2013 diabetes sufferers are almost 50 per cent more likely to suffer a heart attack than the rest of the population according to new figures people with diabetes are almost 50 per cent more likely to have a heart attack than the rest of the population , says a new report			1
it reveals for the first time the scale of complications affecting people with diabetes , who also have a much greater risk of potentially fatal conditions like heart failure , angina and stroke and of needing amputations			1
and it 's not only those with type 2 diabetes - type 1 diabetes sufferers , a condition which develops in childhood , are also at a greater risk of heart attack			1
the findings come from the @entity31 which analysed the care of two million people with diabetes in 2010/11 in @entity35 and @entity36			1
according to the report , 14,476 of those included in the audit had a heart attack during 2010/11 , which is 4,694 more than expected			1
in 2010/11 - 45,000 people with diabetes suffered heart failure - 17,700 ( 65 per cent ) more than the number expected ( 27,300 )			2
the report found people with diabetes are at a 40 per cent higher risk of death than the general population , with 65,700 diabetics dying in 2011 - when 47,000 such deaths were expected			1
people with diabetes are at a 40 per cent higher risk of death than the general population , with 65,700 diabetics dying in 2011 - when 47,000 such deaths were expected			2
the report estimates there were 22,200 excess deaths in @entity35 and 1,900 in @entity36 among people with diabetes			1
around 2.8 million people have diabetes in the @entity60 , while an additional 850,000 people are unaware they have it			2
the report included people with type 1 diabetes , which usually develops in childhood and is controlled by insulin injections , and type 2 - which is linked to unhealthy lifestyles and obesity			1
nine out of ten people with diabetes have type 2 which occurs when the body gradually loses the ability to process blood sugar , leading to high levels which can damage body organs and years of ill - health			1

the study showed that both type 1 and type 2 diabetes sufferers are at risk of heart problems and health complications ( file picture ) the report estimates there were 22,200 excess deaths in @entity35 and 1,900 in @entity36 among people with diabetes			1
women with diabetes were at a greater relative risk of death than men with diabetes : at 142 per cent for @entity96 and 40 per cent for type 2 for women , compared to 130 per cent and 33 per cent respectively for men			1
audit lead clinician dr @entity100 said : ' these results highlight the huge impact of diabetes on disability and premature death			0
' some districts have appreciably lower diabetes related complications than others			0
' the audit for @entity35 and @entity36 is managed by the @entity110 ( @entity110 ) in partnership with @entity112 and commissioned by the @entity113 ( @entity113 )			0
campaigners claim the health toll is the ' tip of the iceberg ' as the audit does not include 10 per cent of people with the condition and those living elsewhere in the @entity60			0
@entity121 , chief executive of @entity112 , said : ' it is a tragedy that a large proportion of these thousands of extra heart attacks could have been prevented simply through better education , treatment and care			0
' we hope this report spurs the @entity130 into action to improve the current situation where fewer than half of people with diabetes meet the recommended cholesterol levels and a significant minority are not even having it measured			0
' a report from @entity139 last month found 24,000 people with diabetes die needlessly each year despite the @entity130 spending Â£ 3.9 billion on their care			2
there is an ' unacceptable postcode lottery ' of care across the country , with massive variations , said the @entity147			0
health secretary @entity148 said ' people with diabetes should be able to expect excellent care from the @entity130 and they will get it more consistently in future			0
' i know there has been progress , but there is still unacceptable variation and we are determined to put that right			0
' health secretary @entity148 says that people with diabetes will be able to expect more consistent healthcare from the @entity130 in the future the @entity60 has the fifth highest rate of type 1 diabetes , which develops in children , according to a charity the @entity60 has the world 's fifth highest rate of type 1 diabetes , which develops in children , according to a health charity			1
diabetes @entity60 says 24.5 per 100,000 children under 14 in the @entity60 are diagnosed every year with type 1 diabetes which , unlike the other main strand , type 2 , is not linked to lifestyle or obesity factors			1
of the 89 countries included in the charity 's data , only @entity177 , @entity178 , @entity179 and @entity180 have higher rates than the @entity60			0
the @entity60 rate is more than double that in @entity187 and @entity188 ; and in @entity189 and @entity190 , which have the joint lowest reported rates in the world , just 0.1 per 100,000 develop the condition a year			0
scientists do not fully understand why there is such wide variation , but genetics is thought to play a role			0
type 1 diabetes , where the body does not produce insulin , can lead to serious illness and even death if it is not diagnosed quickly			2
in the @entity60 only 9 per cent of parents are aware of its symptoms and a quarter of the 2,000 children a year who develop diabetes are only diagnosed once they are already ill , according to the charity			2
symptoms include ; frequent urinating ; excessive thirst ; extreme tiredness ; and unexplained weight loss .			0

the @entity31 analysed the care of two million diabetes sufferers in the @entity60
it found that type 1 and type 2 sufferers were both at greater risk of heart attack
the report estimates 22,000 excess deaths among diabetes sufferers in @entity35 in 2011
