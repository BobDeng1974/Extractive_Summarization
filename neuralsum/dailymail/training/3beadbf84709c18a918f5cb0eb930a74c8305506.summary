by @entity1 reporter published : 09:04 est , 6 february 2014 @entity3 : 14:54 est , 6 february 2014 @entity4 mastered the @entity6 course on his very first run on thursday , leading the opening downhill training session			1
the @entity11 skier , who won a bronze medal in the event four years ago , was cheered on by his wife , volleyball player , @entity14 , at the base of the @entity17 run			1
his one - year - old son , @entity18 , is in @entity19 with his mother , @entity20 , but it is presumed he will be joining @entity4 and his wife in @entity23 after a temporary custody agreement with @entity20 determined he could go to @entity25			1
but on the slopes on thursday , @entity4 's thoughts were on clocking the best time ; the 36 - year - old came in at 2 minutes and 7.75 seconds , giving him the top spot for the training run			1
' if they did , i would be psyched today			0
but it certainly does n't hurt to come out here and ski well first run			0
i just have to keep trimming time			0
' @entity47 of @entity48 , who won the classic downhill in @entity50 on home snow last month , was second , a slim 0.03 seconds behind			2
@entity52 of @entity53 was third , 0.17 behind			0
@entity55 of the @entity11 was fourth , although he was one of several skiers who missed gates			0
@entity59 's @entity58 was fifth , 0.69 behind , and should be a contender on the course			2
@entity4 , who has indicated this could be his last @entity6 , cut his 2011 - 12 season short after an injury in @entity23 and had microfracture surgery			1
he took all of last season off to let his knee properly heel			0
he faced trouble in his personal life too - losing his younger brother @entity72 , who died of a seizure last april , and struggling through a custody battle after learning @entity20 was pregnant			1
support : his wife @entity14 , who shared this image online , was at the event to cheer for him together : the couple are pictured together at the men 's @entity80 downhill in @entity53 last month @entity4 and @entity20 had a brief relationship in 2012 in @entity82 after meeting on a high - end dating website and after they went on a few dates , @entity20 discovered she was pregnant			1
but @entity4 , who also has a five - year - old daughter from another relationship , had already started dating volleyball player @entity14 , and after five months they married			1
the case became a cause for women 's rights advocates after a judge castigated @entity20 for moving while pregnant to @entity19			2
she 's a former marine and firefighter now studying at @entity95			2
as they battled with the courts , his wife @entity96 fell pregnant - but suffered a miscarriage soon after			1
@entity20 has had temporary custody of the boy , whom @entity4 calls @entity18 but whom @entity20 calls @entity103 , since november while @entity4 was away in @entity104 and @entity105 seeking to qualify			1
on his way : it is believed that @entity4 will be joined by his son @entity18 , pictured together last year , in @entity23 after winning a temporary custody order in december that allows the one - year - old to go to @entity25 adorable : @entity96 shared a photo of baby @entity18 relaxing next to his dad on a private plane last year dispute : @entity18 's mother is @entity20 , a @entity117 who met @entity4 on a dating website in 2012			1
they have been involved in a long custody battle since the baby 's birth last february but at the end of the year , @entity20 and @entity4 hammered out the details of a temporary custody agreement in place until at least a march 31 court date			1
it also allows him to take his son to @entity23			1
after the struggles - both professionally and personally - @entity4 seemingly regained his form and finished second in a @entity80 giant slalom in december			1
then he had two podium results on the famed @entity136 course in @entity137 , @entity53 , last month			0
but last weekend he banged up his right knee during a crash in a giant slalom in @entity141 , @entity48			0
' it 's still puffed up a little bit and a little bit sore , ' @entity4 said			2
' there 's nothing wrong with it , just got banged hard			0
' consequently , @entity4 was a bit tentative on the @entity23 course 's biggest jump , labeled the @entity25 trampoline , which comes midway down			1
spat : @entity4 , with his wife left and @entity18 right , now has temporary custody of the boy until the end of march no rest : @entity96 shared a photo of her heading to the gym before her husband 's training run ' it 's really bumpy and rattley , ' he said of the icy landing area			1
' that 's one of the places where i went way out in the soft snow			0
' overall , though , @entity4 was pleased to see that the course had n't been altered much since the 2012 test event , in which several other skiers were also injured			2
' they did n't dumb it down much , which is nice , ' said @entity4 , who finished fourth in the test downhill			2
' they did n't ice the top , which is understandable - the turns are huge up there			0
the swing and turns would make it very tough for guys on top if it were icy			0
it would be better for me but that 's fine			0
i still feel like i have the ability to ski that top and put time on guys			0
' but once you come out of the chute all the way down they did n't take anything away			0
the speeds are up , the terrain is challenging and the jumps are big			0
fighter : @entity4 ( pictured thursday ) suffered a knee injury on the course in 2012			1
his events start on sunday ' there 's a lot of different places where you can make mistakes and where it 's really challenging - especially linking sections together			2
' the training session was held in perfect conditions , under a bright sun and clear skies			1
the snow was grippy on top , icier in the middle section and softer at the bottom where the temperature was above the freezing			0
all 61 racers who started reached the finish			0
two more training sessions are scheduled before sunday 's race opens the @entity223 events .			2

@entity4 clocked 2 minutes , 7.75 seconds during a training session on thursday on the @entity17 piste - where he *previously* suffered an injury
his volleyball star wife @entity14 , *26* , is in @entity23 to support him and his one - year - old son @entity18 is *expected* to join them
@entity4 has been *embroiled* in custody battle with the boy 's mother but a temporary custody agreement means he can head to @entity23
