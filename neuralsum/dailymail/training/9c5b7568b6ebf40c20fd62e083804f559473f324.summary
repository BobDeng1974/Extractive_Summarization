@entity1 , the civil rights movie about @entity3 , was made without using any direct quotation from the man for fear of being sued by his family , it has emerged			1
the @entity10 film , starring @entity11 as @entity3 , features setpiece orations from the events around his marches from @entity1 , @entity16 , to state capital @entity18 - but they are deliberate approximations rather than his actual words			1
filmmakers @entity20 , who released the movie on december 25 in the @entity24 , wanted to use his actual words , but studiously avoided it so they would not be sued by his famously litigious descendants			0
as a result key parts of the pivotal protests marches in 1965 have been rewritten to dodge the rights issue			0
for instance , @entity3 's chant of ' give us the ballot ' was tweaked to be ' give us the vote '			2
while an accusing demand spoken over the body of a protester is rendered in the film as ' who murdered @entity60 ? ' - in reality he asked ' who killed him ? ' an earlier account by the @entity64 said that @entity20 tried to negotiate rights from @entity66 and @entity67 , who are linked to the @entity44 project , but failed			2
they did not approach @entity3 's descendants directly , the reporter said , realizing it was a lost cause			1
a spokesman for the film said : ' there were no negotiations , - the film does not use any copyrighted material			0
' @entity3 's family , who run @entity81 to protect and license his work , have previous sued @entity83 and @entity84 for reproducing parts of his speeches without paying for rights first			1
litigious : @entity3 's children @entity90 ( left ) @entity91 ( second left ) and @entity92 ( right ) , pictured with their mother @entity94 ( center ) have successfully sued media outlets for using @entity3 's words without permission , and levies an $ 800,000 fee for a statue of him on the @entity101 when the @entity102 was fundraising to install a statue in @entity3 's honor in @entity105 's @entity101 , they were charged a total of more than $ 800,000 to inscribe some of his writings into the marble			0
historian and @entity3 biographer @entity110 has previously said the civil rights leader would be ' absolutely scandalized by the profiteering behavior of his children '			2
however , he said that the changes did not seriously compromise @entity1 , which he said ' captures him very nicely , while evading the clutches of the greedy family ' .			0

@entity118 , about 1965 civil rights marches in @entity16 , does *n't* quote directly
instead uses approximations and *paraphrase* to convey his speeches
@entity3 's family have been known to sue *people* who quote out of turn
@entity44 currently has the rights for big screen *adaptation*
*conflict* forced @entity20 to work around the *restriction* for @entity1
