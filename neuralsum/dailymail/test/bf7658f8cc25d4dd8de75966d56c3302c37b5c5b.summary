@entity0 is personally against the legalization of marijuana but the @entity4 presidential candidate said this weekend that he believes states have the right to put decriminalization laws on the books if they want - even though they directly conflict with federal law			1
@entity0 implied during a conversation with @entity11 on saturday that if he ascended to the highest elected office he would n't make his attorney general enforce federal laws pertaining to marijuana in states that have approved sales and consumption of the drug			1
the position stands in contrast to the views of at least three of his @entity4 competitors , who last week said that while they believe in states ' rights to self - determination , they 'd lay the hammer down on @entity28 and @entity29 for flouting federal law			1
@entity4 presidential candidate sen. @entity31 implied during a conversation with @entity11 on saturday that if he ascended to the highest elected office he would n't make his attorney general enforce federal laws pertaining to marijuana in states that have approved sales and consumption of the sticky icky @entity0 , pictured here on sunday in @entity39 , @entity40 , at the @entity41 , is personally against the legalization of marijuana but said this weekend he believes states have the right to put decriminalization laws on the books if they want - even though they directly conflict with federal law asked saturday during a @entity40 campaign stop if he would direct his attorney general to enforce federal pot laws , @entity0 said ‘ yes ’ before providing a lengthy answer that indicated he would not			1
he first said that ‘ if the attorney general and the president disagree with federal drug law they should come to @entity55 ’ because @entity4 and @entity56 can come together on the issue of drug reforms			2
‘ but it is lawless for the attorney general simply with a stroke of a pen to say we will not enforce these federal laws we disagree with			2
' he was referring at that time to @entity67 's @entity66 's decision to look the other way when it comes to minor drug offenses across the country			0
he then said : ‘ there is a different circumstance when you have states that a democratically adopted law that legalizes marijuana			2
' ' when that happens that 's a change in the legal standard , and then you have to apply conflict of law standards , ' @entity0 , the former solicitor general of the state of @entity80 , said			2
' in my view the question of legalizing marijuana should be a question for the states			0
now personally i do n't support legalization			2
if it came up for a vote in the state of @entity80 , i 'd vote no. but i respect the genius of the framers of our @entity96 , ' he added			0
@entity0 's stance on the issue presents a problem the politician who has said the ' most dangerous ' aspect of president @entity108 's tenure ‘ has been lawlessness , the unwillingness of the president to follow federal law or the @entity96			1
’ @entity109 , clause 2 of the @entity96 , better known as the @entity111 , clearly states that laws established by @entity55 are ' the supreme law of the land ' and the @entity114 has consistently ruled in favor of the federal government			2
a strict @entity119 who has made a career for himself by bashing @entity108 for straying from its principles , @entity0 's promise to respect the founding document has been at the center of his campaign for presidency			0
during his gaggle with reporters on saturday after his speech at the @entity127 in the @entity129 conference in @entity130 , @entity40 , @entity0 levied the attack on @entity108 's lawlessness , then , a minute or two later , in response to another question , said he would not vote in favor of the president 's attorney general nominee @entity138 when her name comes up for consideration in the @entity142			0
the reason for his ' no ' vote , he said , is the support for the president ’s lawlessness that she demonstrated at her confirmation hearing			0
the role of the attorney general he said , is ' to remain faithful to the rule of law and the @entity96 and the @entity153 people ’			0
@entity0 was then asked if he ’d make his own attorney general follow the rule of law when it comes to federal marijuana policy			1
just say no : @entity0 's position stands in contrast to three of his @entity4 competitors - @entity161 , left , @entity162 , center , and @entity164 , right - who said last week that while they believe in states ' rights to self - determination , they 'd lay the hammer down on @entity28 and @entity29 for flouting federal law @entity0 shakes hands with @entity171 , 8 , of @entity172 , @entity40 , at his sunday stop			1
@entity0 was in town for the @entity127 in the @entity129 forum , held saturday in @entity130 @entity11 followed up on the statement in an email to @entity0 's presidential campaign and pointed out that the constitutional scholar seemed to arguing that states ’ rights should supersede federal law in this specific ‘ circumstance ’ - marijuana policy - and that he 'd legally get around the @entity111 of the @entity96 by claiming that ‘ conflict of law standards ’ should apply			1
it further pointed out that the @entity108 administration 's alleged violation of @entity189 of the @entity96 , the section that pertains to the executive branch , is not dissimilar from @entity0 's own intentions			0
lawyers for the @entity66 have argued in court that the president was within his legal right to act on immigration			0
@entity11 also pointed out that @entity0 's competitors for the @entity4 nomination - @entity199 governor @entity162 , a likely 2016 candidate , and @entity202 senator @entity161 , an announced contender - were asked a similar question about weed on conservative radio host @entity206 's show last week and they were clear in their answers			1
' marijuana is a gateway drug , ' @entity162 said after @entity206 asked him if he 'd crackdown on weed sales in @entity28 and @entity29			1
citing an ' enormous addiction problem in this country , ' @entity162 said , ' we need to send very clear leadership from the @entity216 on down through the federal law enforcement			2
' marijuana is an illegal drug under federal law			1
and the states should not be permitted to sell it and profit from it			0
' asked for the same thing by @entity206 , @entity161 said ' yes , i think we need to enforce our federal laws			0
' @entity161 , who is also a lawyer by trade , said he 's a believer in states ' rights , ' but they do n’t have a right to write federal policy as well			0
' stating for the record his own sentiments on weed , @entity161 then said , ' i do n’t believe we should be in the business of legalizing additional intoxicants in this country for the primary reason that when you legalize something , what you ’re sending a message to young people is it ca n’t be that bad , because if it was that bad , it would n’t be legal			0
' a candidate 's best friend : @entity0 posed for pictures with potential supporters and their pets			0
a former solicitor general of @entity80 , @entity0 's stance on pot resents a problem the politician who has said the ' most dangerous ' aspect of president @entity108 's tenure ‘ has been lawlessness , the unwillingness of the president to follow federal law or the @entity96 ' accompanying @entity0 on the trip was his wife @entity267			1
she 's pictured here on sunday at the @entity41 club in a separate interview with @entity11 , @entity271 senator @entity164 , who is expected to join the race at the end of may , said he ' would not embrace legalizing marijuana			0
' asked if he would crack down on states deploying their own standards for weed sales as president , @entity164 said , ' the federal law preempts the state law			1
we just ca n't just take the law and do what we ca n't			0
' in response to @entity11 's email , a spokesperson for @entity0 said in a statement : ' just because federal case law allows the federal government to assert the @entity111 to try to displace state law , does not mean that in every instance the federal government should do so			2
' the response indicated that @entity0 , if president , would not force his attorney general 's office to go after states that legalize pot because he does n't think the @entity111 of the @entity96 should be applied in areas where voters have said they want to get high without repercussions			2
' the @entity304 of our @entity96 understood cooperative federalism -- the overlapping spheres of authority between the federal and state governments -- and federal law enforcement can and often should respect and incorporate state law , ' the statement from @entity0 's campaign continued			1
' the voters of the states of @entity28 and @entity29 have made the decision to legalize marijuana , and that is a change in law that alters the appropriate enforcement of federal law			1
' she also made clear that @entity0 is of the opinion that the @entity66 ' lacks the authority to simply refuse to enforce current federal law ' in states that have not passed their own marijuana laws			1
the couple went to church on saturday in @entity331 , @entity40 , at the @entity332			0

@entity0 is personally against the legalization of marijuana but believes states have the right to put decriminalization laws on the books if they want
implied he would n't make his ag enforce federal pot laws in states that have approved sales - even though directly conflict with federal law
stands in contrast to the views of at least three of his @entity4 competitors who said they 'd lay the hammer down on @entity28 and @entity29
