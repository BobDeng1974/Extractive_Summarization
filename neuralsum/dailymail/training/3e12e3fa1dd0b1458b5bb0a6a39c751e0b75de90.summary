@entity0 was three when her childhood came to an abrupt end			1
the daughter of a struggling teenage mother , her life had been blighted by fecklessness and her parent 's regular brushes with the law			2
but when social services stepped in to take the little girl and her younger brother @entity12 away , she found herself shuttling between foster homes while her mother fought to prevent her children from being adopted			1
after more than a decade of living with carers , including several convicted criminals , she was finally adopted and , now 29 , says she is furious that it was n't allowed to happen sooner			1
' i moved 14 different times during the nearly 10 years i was in foster care , ' she says angrily , speaking from her @entity35 home			1
' most of my homes were overcrowded and almost 25 per cent of my foster parents were , or became , convicted criminals			1
needless to say , i was not placed in the most desirable of circumstances			0
' while in care i was beaten , went hungry , and was generally neglected			0
luckily , i was the kind of kid that learned how to stay out of trouble			0
' but many of the other children were not as lucky			0
my brother was almost killed in one foster home and the abuse stories i heard from my foster brothers and sisters are almost unspeakable			2
' although adopted in 1998 by the kindly @entity0 family , she remains furious about what happened to her and says that adoption should be made easier - and should happen sooner			1
' i should not have been in foster care for as long as i was , ' she says			2
' they should have done more to place me with a suitable relative , or i should have been available for adoption much , much sooner			2
' instead , the courts kept giving my mother more and more time to get her act together until a volunteer advocate for my case came forward and convinced the courts to terminate my mother 's rights			1
' but by that time , i was already nine years old and had nearly grown up in the system			2
' difficult : in 10 years , @entity0 lived in 14 homes with carers that included convicted criminals and a paedophile the author of a successful 2008 memoir , @entity78 , ms @entity0 has also thrown herself into campaigning for the rights of children in care and says better vetting for would - be foster carers is essential			1
' all children should be protected , ' says the foster mother of 20 and adoptive mother of one			1
' in the @entity89 , every citizen can report child abuse			0
' that abuse will be investigated by law enforcement and if it is found that the child is not safe in their home , the child will be removed			0
' but although police are quick to intervene in abuse cases , what follows afterwards can leave the child even more damaged than before			0
' in most cases , foster families would be the better than a group home since they are supposed to be more " normal " , ' she explains			1
' children that grow up in group homes or facilities can become institutionalised and have difficulty functioning in the real world as teens or adults			0
' but the reality is that many children end up bouncing home to home , relatives are not always located or searched for properly and sometimes they go back to their families only to return to foster care again			1
' i think the government need to support child welfare initiatives and make sure we get help for foster parents , social workers , and agencies with a view to keeping children and families safe			1
' video courtesy of @entity131 happy ending : @entity0 with her adoptive parents @entity134 and @entity135 , her husband and their small children but it is finding a way to get more children out of care homes and into loving adoptive families that remains her overwhelming passion and she cites her own appalling upbringing as a good example of why change is needed			1
' finding a forever family was scary for me at first , ' she admits			0
' most people think adoption is a happy occasion but i was terrified that it was too good to be true and that it would fall apart			2
' i had seen so many kids be " un-adopted " and sent back into foster care			0
i had been rejected by so many foster families and i did n't expect this home to be any different			1
' despite her fears , her adoption by @entity134 and @entity160 - both of whom are on the receiving end of a paean of praise in her memoir - proved to be the making of her			2
' i think my life would be very different if i had never been adopted , ' she says , frankly			0
' i always loved school and had a drive to succeed but they introduced me to a world that i never would have known			0
' i like to think i would have made good choices but my life would have been infinitely harder and probably not as successful			0
' simply having stability and not having to worry about where i would sleep , whether eat , and knowing i was safe allowed me to thrive			0
for the first time in my life i got to travel , have slumber parties with friends , and participate in school activities			0
' children who do not find families often become homeless , teen parents , have abusive relationships , or get arrested and do n't lead productive lives			1
that easily could have been me			0
