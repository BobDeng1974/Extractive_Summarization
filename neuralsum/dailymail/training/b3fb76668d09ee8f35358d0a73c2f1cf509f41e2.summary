lying ? @entity0 began complaining about the effects of the experimental drug before they had been administered for his execution an @entity6 inmate executed amid a legal challenge over lethal injection began complaining about the effects on his body before the drugs were administered , prompting some to question whether he may have exaggerated his symptoms to help his fellow death row inmates ' case			1
@entity0 , who was executed thursday for the killing of an 11 - month - old girl in 1997 , said during his last words : ' it feels like acid			1
' the comment came before any of the lethal drugs were administered and while he was only receiving a saline drip through an intravenous line			0
while on the gurney , he also said he 'd been ' poked ' five times			0
@entity0 's attorney who witnessed his execution , @entity29 , said since she was n't able to view the iv insertion , she asked @entity0 to tell her how many times the execution team tried to insert the line and whether he was experiencing any problems			1
@entity29 said she and @entity0 's family members found @entity0 's comments ' disturbing ' and ' confusing			2
' @entity0 was the first person put to death in @entity6 since a botched execution in april that left @entity38 gasping for air and writhing in pain for 43 minutes			1
the procedure drew national attention to the drugs used in lethal injections			0
on thursday , after the first drug , a sedative , was administered , @entity0 again complained : ' my body is on fire			1
' @entity29 said she does n't believe @entity0 would have exaggerated symptoms of suffering , and that defense lawyers would never coach death row inmates about what to say during their last words			2
we have tried to get transparency about what they 're doing and to be able to observe ( the iv insertion ) , ' @entity29 said of prison officials			0
' and we 've been denied that			0
so between the actual veiling and the chemical veiling , it 's very hard for us to know what 's going on			0
' but some criminal prosecutors suggested death row inmates would be quick to exaggerate the symptoms of an execution , especially if doing so would be helpful to fellow death row inmates			0
' i think what you witnessed is predictable , especially if it could be helpful to the guys behind him , ' said @entity92 , a northern @entity6 prosecutor who recently protested a death row inmate 's request for clemency			2
@entity96 , a retired prison guard who spent his entire career at the @entity67 , said there is a brotherhood among death row inmates and that he thinks @entity0 was ' hamming it up			1
' ' he did it for the other inmates , ' @entity96 said			0
neither @entity92 nor @entity96 witnessed @entity0 's execution			1
@entity0 and other death row inmates were plaintiffs in a lawsuit challenging @entity6 's method of execution as cruel and unusual			1
they claimed the first drug , midazolam , wo n't properly anesthetize an inmate before the second and third drugs are administered			0
although the @entity119 @entity118 rejected @entity0 's request for a stay of execution in a narrow 5 - 4 ruling on thursday , the inmates ' request for the high court to consider the merit of their challenge still is pending , according to @entity126 , an attorney for the inmates			1
writing the dissent , justice @entity128 said she believes questions about the effectiveness of drugs used in executions is particularly important now because of states ' increasing reliance on new and scientifically untested methods of execution			0
the gurney in the the execution chamber at the @entity67 is pictured in @entity68 , @entity6			2
