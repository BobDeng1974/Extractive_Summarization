by @entity1 reporter @entity2 has not yet finished her latest book which will play an important role in her expected presidential race			1
' it ’s a bit of a struggle to get it done ... she is not necessarily a natural writer , ' one anonymous friend told the @entity10			0
another reason she is reportedly having trouble completing the book about her time as secretary of state is the fact that she is well aware of the backlash that will come from @entity19			1
some of @entity21 's former aides have already formed a group with a team dedicated to countering any claims she makes in the book , which does not yet have a release date but is expected sometime this summer			1
tense moment : the killing of @entity30 ( pictured ) and the @entity31 are two of the main accomplishments that are expected to be included in her book , which will be published sometime this summer her advance payment for the book has not been released , but her first memoir , which was also published by @entity39 , netted her $ 8million in 2000			1
@entity19 operative @entity40 is one of the two heads of the group , @entity42 , and he said that mrs @entity2 is going to have trouble defining her time in office			2
' the challenge for her with this book is to highlight a tangible accomplishment that voters can identify , ' mr @entity40 told the paper			0
other @entity19 have also helped that effort , as they have been trashing her time at state - particularly over the handling of the attack on the @entity56 consulate in @entity57 - largely because she is the unabashed frontrunner for the @entity59 in 2016 , and likely because early polls show that there is no current @entity19 candidate who could beat her			1
critical : one of the most hotly - anticipated portions of the book will come when she describes how she and the @entity69 administration handled the attack on the @entity56 consulate in @entity71 under scrutiny : @entity19 have already made an opposition team to ' correct ' any assertions she makes about @entity57 and other hot - button issues in her upcoming book ' it ’s almost becoming a kind of conventional wisdom that there were minimal accomplishments , ' one unidentified friend of @entity80 's told the @entity10 , showing what damage the @entity19 offensive is doing to her legacy			1
the knocks against mrs @entity2 and her time as the head of the @entity91 comes in contrast to the high praise she was being given this time last year as she left the post , which was then taken over by @entity96			0
her popularity was at an all - time high when she left the @entity91 but now that mr @entity96 is in office , he is the one earning praise for his work on issues like @entity104 sanctions			0
though his supporters admitted that much of his success was based on the groundwork that she laid out during her term , they are still allegedly concerned that her book will take the spotlight away from @entity96 and back to her			0
building relationships : mrs @entity2 , who visited 112 countries as secretary of state , made inroads at many including in @entity119 where she met with pro-democracy opposition leader @entity120 ( pictured in december 2011 ) that said , most @entity59 are on her side in the matter , as her loyal band of defenders have created their own group of researchers and fact - checkers to debunk any claims that the @entity19 make about alleged falsehoods in her book			1
others said that she dedicated much of her time in december and january to writing the book - with the help of speechwriters @entity135 and @entity136 and research assistant @entity137			2
her other close advisors , like @entity140 , @entity141 and @entity142 , are all thought to be working as sounding boards as well , @entity138 reported			0
' she ’s very animated about it , ' former congresswoman @entity144 said of mrs @entity2 's book			2
' this is the first time in a very long time that she gets to talk about important , weighty things as she thinks of them , unencumbered by the responsibilities of office or serving in the administration			0
' it ’s almost like this is @entity2 unencumbered			0

@entity80 is writing a book about her time as secretary of state
the book will come out this summer and is expected to be a *launching* *pad* for her presidential run as she will have a book tour to tout her accomplishments and tell her side of the story
@entity19 have already started *smearing* her time as the country 's top *diplomat* and are taking particular aim at her handling of @entity57
