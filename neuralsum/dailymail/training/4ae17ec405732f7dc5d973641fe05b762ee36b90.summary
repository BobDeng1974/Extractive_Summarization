by @entity0 published : 10:29 est , 23 april 2013 updated : 16:59 est , 23 april 2013 in a pretty , well - mowed corner of south - west @entity3 , it seems austerity does n’t exist			2
for @entity5 is increasing prize money by a staggering 40 per cent – making it the biggest winnings pot in the history of professional tennis			1
at this year ’s competition , the @entity11 will hand out a total of £ 22.6million – an increase of £ 6.5million – but the move has provoked an angry backlash from tennis fans			1
@entity24 's @entity23 pictured in action on the court iconic : an artist 's impression of the @entity19 court at @entity5 with a new retractable roof changes : @entity32 had a new roof put on it in 2009 , but this image shows what both would look like with one in place to battle @entity22 's often poor summers @entity5 - £ 22.6m with £ 1.6m for singles champions @entity41 - £ 22m with prize money for singles champions to be confirmed @entity44 - £ 20.3m with £ 1.63m for singles champions @entity46 - £ 18.8m with £ 1.28m for singles champions winners of the men ’s and ladies ’ singles titles this year will take home £ 1.6million , up from the £ 1.15million which @entity52 and @entity53 netted last year			1
and the players who lose in the early rounds will enjoy even bigger pay increases , earning 62 per cent more than last year			0
players who lose in the first round of the singles will be paid £ 23,500 , which is more than some school teachers earn in a year			1
after the announcement was made yesterday , chairman of the @entity11 @entity65 was asked to justify the increase at a time when the @entity22 economy is in the doldrums			0
‘ the economic climate is difficult , i would accept that , ’ he said			0
what it looks like now : @entity5 expects to complete the roof over @entity76 ( right ) in time for @entity5 2019 play on : the roof over @entity32 has been regarded as a success since its installation in 2009 ‘ but i think we have to accept that the world that we live in is a world where we are competing with other international tennis events			1
‘ it is not just about the top players , it is about making the sport attractive to the next generation of talent			0
’ the new investment was partly in response to players demanding a larger percentage of the competition ’s revenue – usually around 20 per cent			0
mr @entity65 said : ‘ we wanted to demonstrate to all the players how much they are appreciated by @entity5			2
pay rise : both the @entity98 champions will each receive £ 1.6m this year , pictured here are the 2012 victors @entity52 and @entity53 ' we have made these increases because we want to make them , not because we had to			1
’ but critics took to social networking site @entity105 to condemn the extravagant increases			0
@entity107 said it was ‘ excessive ’ , while @entity109 wrote : ‘ what is wrong with us ? there are people starving and homeless ! ’ it was also announced that a retractable roof will built over @entity76 by 2019 , following the success of @entity32 ’s roof installed in 2009 , and the grounds will be redeveloped in the theme of ‘ tennis in an @entity121 country garden ’			1
mr @entity65 refused to comment on how much the renovations would cost , but insisted ‘ fans wo n’t pay the price ’			0
this year 's championships take place from june 24 - july 7			1
by @entity127 , @entity128 's tennis correspondent those who regard @entity5 as slightly staid or old fashioned have always profoundly misunderstood the @entity11 , never more so than when it comes to this announcement of jaw dropping prize money increases and yet more redevelopment of the grounds			1
' we can not afford to stand still , ' was the mantra of chairman @entity65 as he unveiled the most significant prize pot rises in the history of tennis , along with long - term development plans that include the building of a new roof on @entity76			1
it is all about maintaining the tournament ’s position as , arguably , the most successful annual event in any sport and certainly in tennis – something that does not come without a talent for innovation and surprise			2
there was an air of democracy around the 40 % rise in the player payment fund , with the massive jump of 60 % - plus for early round losers the latest statement from the four @entity161 that they care about the rank - and - file performers who fill out the draw			2
and it was emphasised that it will not be the ordinary fans through the gate who foot the bill , with a pledge to keep ticket prices steady and the money coming from increased commercial activity and aspects like the huge new television deal announced with @entity176			2
yet it is a tricky time to announce bumper paydays for young athletes in the current economic climate and the reward - for - failure argument has a ring of truth to it as well , especially in the women ’s game			0
with @entity5 now wedded to the idea of equal prize money the high proportion of one - sided matches on the women ’s side in the first week will see the vanquished banking £ 23,500 for their trouble			1
that will prove more contentious than the champions getting £ 1.6m , which they will hardly notice			1
and the scramble for wildcards among @entity22 hopefuls will be more intense than ever , and probably subject of more rancour			0
small wonder when the minimum a player would receive for gaining entry into the singles and doubles is now £ 27,375			1
what is effectively happening is that @entity5 and the other three slams are propping up the finances of the players ranked below 60 who , with some justification , have complained that the more regular tour events are not sufficiently rewarding them , given the costs of travelling on a global circuit			2
it also represents another victory for the @entity219 who , with their @entity220 led by the hugely influential @entity52 , have secured unprecedented pay rises for their constituents			0
their female counterparts have quietly ridden in their slipstream on the matter , and must be absolutely ecstatic			0
the long - term plans for the grounds look superb , with much consideration given to the overall spectator experience , which already rates very highly			0
the truth is that @entity76 , which is only sixteen years old , has never quite generated the atmosphere that was hoped and a substantial redesign , and the facility for wet weather play , will be a welcome development if it is done with flair			0
no , there is not much standing still down at @entity240 , where the recession appears a distant rumour .			0

@entity5 singles champions will each receive £ 1.6m - up £ *450,000*
*organisers* say £ 22.6m prize pot is ' largest total in the history of tennis '
new retractable roof will be in place by 2019 to stop *disruption* of play
@entity32 's £ 150m roof , installed in 2009 , has been a huge success
