by @entity0 in 2018 @entity2 ’s @entity1 will take flight to help us understand more about the universe			1
but @entity2 has already begun to lay out plans for their next space observatory in the hope of one day tracking down alien life			1
called the @entity11 ( @entity12 ) , the mission concept builds upon key technologies developed for @entity14 and the @entity1			1
this artist 's rendition shows a possible design of a potential successor to the @entity14			0
a @entity2 - led team of experts in now investigating the viability of this conceptual mission , called the @entity11 ( @entity12 ) one hundred million worlds in our galaxy are able to host alien life , according to a ‘ conservative ’ prediction by @entity2			1
and the space agency claims that we will be able to find that life within the next 20 years , with a high chance it will be outside our solar system			0
during a public talk yesterday in @entity33 , the space agency outlined a roadmap to search for life in the universe using a number of current and future telescopes			0
' do we believe there is life beyond @entity41 ? ' said former astronaut and @entity2 administrator @entity43 during a talk earlier this month in @entity33			2
' i would venture to say that most of my colleagues here today say it is improbable that in the limitless vastness of the universe we humans stand alone			0
' a team led by scientists and engineers at @entity2 ’s @entity56 in @entity57 , @entity52 is now studying the scientific and technical requirements and costs associated with building the telescope			1
' conceptually , @entity12 would leverage the technological advances pioneered by the @entity63 telescope , such as deployable , large segmented - mirror arrays , ' said dr @entity65 , @entity12 study scientist and @entity1 ’s project scientist			1
they add that , while @entity14 and @entity1 will last for many years into the future , the agency is already looking ahead to the telescope and instrument requirements needed to answer the questions posed in @entity2 ’s 30 - year vision			1
the 30 - year vision has three main goals : are we alone , how did we get here and how does the universe work			0
' one of the killer apps currently planned for @entity12 is the ability to detect signatures of life in the atmospheres of @entity41 - like planets in the solar neighborhood , ' dr @entity65 said			1
while other observatories will image larger exoplanets , they would not have @entity12 ’s advanced ability to identify chemicals that may indicate the presence of life in these far - flung , @entity41 - size worlds			2
@entity12 ’s large primary mirror would enable other scientific investigations , too			2
in addition to studying star and galaxy formation in detail , @entity12 would be able to resolve stars in galaxies more than 10 million light - years away and star - formation regions of sizes greater than 325 light years anywhere in the universe			0
look familiar ? atlast would be a successor to the @entity1 ( @entity1 ) , illustration shown , which is due to launch in 2018			2
one of @entity12 's primary goals will be to address @entity2 's 30 - year vision , which questions whether we are alone in the universe or not and also how the cosmos truly works to achieve these ambitious goals , the observatory needs to be thermally and mechanically very stable , which can be achieved by operating in the @entity119 - @entity118 orbit - the same orbit chosen for the @entity1			1
it might also be equipped with a star shade to mask the light of distant stars , which will help it spot @entity41 - like planets in orbit			0
but perhaps more importantly , it would have to carry a significantly larger primary mirror - one even larger than the @entity1 ’s , which will be the largest segmented mirror ever flown by @entity2			1
the team is studying the viability of a 33 - foot ( 10 - meter ) glass or carbon - fiber segmented mirror , which would give the telescope a larger light - gathering surface , but still fit inside the fairing of an existing launch vehicle			0
for comparison , @entity1 is to be equipped with a 21 - foot ( 6.5 - meter ) segmented primary mirror			2
' this gives [ @entity12 ] seventeen times greater light - gathering capability than @entity14 ’s mirror , ' added dr @entity144 , a @entity145 engineer who is leading the team evaluating the technologies needed to pull off the @entity12 mission			0
and dr @entity149 , the @entity145 senior scientist for @entity150 in @entity151 and @entity12 study scientist , added : ' @entity12 would achieve critically important science goals not possible with ground - based observatories or with any other planned space missions			0
' now is the time to plan for the future			0

@entity2 scientists in @entity52 have *revealed* plans for a new giant telescope
called the @entity11 ( @entity12 )
it will be the successor to 2018 's @entity1 ( @entity1 )
the huge telescope will be designed to hunt for alien life on other planets
and its primary goal will be to answer once and for all : ' are we alone ? '
