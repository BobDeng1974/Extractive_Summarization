by @entity0 april was the joint hottest on record globally , forecasters have revealed			1
the combined average temperature over global land and ocean surfaces for april 2014 tied with 2010 as the highest on record for the month , at 0.77 ° @entity7 ) above the 20th century average of @entity9 ( 56.7 ° f )			1
researchers today said a sweltering summer is on the cards as the @entity14 weather phenomenon is set to return - but say it could also result in fewer hurricanes			1
april across the world : the combined average temperature over global land and ocean surfaces for april 2014 tied with 2010 as the highest on record for the month , at 0.77 ° @entity7 ) above the 20th century average of @entity9 ( 56.7 ° f )			1
@entity14 refers to a set of conditions when the surface of the sea in an area along the @entity23 in the central and eastern @entity24 becomes hotter than usual			1
the average water temperature in that area is typically between 1 and @entity28 ( approximately 2 and 5 ° f ) warmer than normal during this event			1
this has the effect of adding huge amounts of heat and moisture into the atmosphere , ultimately affecting patterns of air pressure and rainfall across the @entity24 and globally			0
strong @entity14 events occur every 20 years or so , but researchers recently said this could drop to 10 years thanks to global warming			1
at the opposite end of the scale , @entity44 is the climatological counterpart to @entity14			1
@entity44 refers to periods when sea - surface temperatures around the @entity23 are cooler than normal			0
this has a similar affect on air pressure and rainfall because it suppresses how much heat and moisture enters the atmosphere			0
a slower - than - usual hurricane season is expected this year because of an expected @entity14 , forecasters said - but they warned that it takes only one storm to wreak havoc and urged @entity61 to be prepared			1
the @entity14 , which warms part of the @entity24 every few years and changes rain and temperature patterns around the world , will likely reduce the number and intensity of tropical storms and hurricanes , the @entity62 said in @entity71			1
cooler temperatures on the surface of the @entity74 compared with recent years will also lower the probability of hurricane formation			0
officials expect about eight to 13 named tropical storms and three to six hurricanes			0
just one or two major hurricanes with winds over 110 miles per hour are forecast			0
the six - month storm season begins june 1			0
forecasters got it wrong last year when they predicted an unusually busy hurricane season			0
there were just 13 named storms and two hurricanes , @entity89 and @entity90 , both of which were category 1 , the lowest on the scale that measures hurricanes by wind speed			0
there were no major hurricanes			0
in 2012 , storm surge was devastating to the @entity71 area when @entity100 slammed the @entity101 , killing 147 people and causing $ 50 billion in damage			0
@entity100 lost hurricane status when it made landfall in @entity106			0
person walking in @entity108 : a slower - than - usual hurricane season is expected this year because of an expected @entity14 , forecasters said a new mapping tool this year will keep coastal residents updated on the storm surge threat in their communities			2
the @entity74 hurricane season goes through cycles of high and low activity about every 25 to 40 years based on large scale climatic patterns in the atmosphere			0
since 1995 , an average season has 15 named tropical storms , eight hurricanes and about four major storms			0
the last time a major hurricane made landfall in the @entity61 was when @entity126 came ashore in 2005 , an eight - year stretch that is the longest on record			0
during the six - month season , forecasters name tropical storms when top winds reach 39 mph ; hurricanes have maximum winds of at least 74 mph			0
however , meteorologists are predicting that the weather will go wild later this year			0
the cause is @entity14 , a warming of sea - surface temperatures in the @entity24 , which can trigger both floods and drought in different parts of the world			2
but while scientists are anticipating a stronger - than - usual @entity14 , many are warning that the planet is ill prepared to deal with the consequences			1
a spike in @entity24 sea temperatures and the rapid movement of warm water eastwards have increased fears this year 's @entity14 could be one of the strongest yet			1
@entity14 , pictured left , is a warming of sea temperatures that can trigger floods and droughts			2
@entity44 , pictured right , is when sea temperatures drop the more heat in the @entity24 , the large the @entity14 and right now a ball of warm water is crossing the ocean 490ft ( 150 metres ) below the surface			1
a majority of weather forecasting models indicate that the phenomenon may develop around the middle of the year , but it was too early to assess its likely strength , the @entity163 @entity162 said on 15 april			0
meteorologists claim the prospect of an @entity14 will likely be firmed up ' in the next month or two ' , although forecasting its strength will be hard to do			1
the chance of it developing in 2014 exceeded 70 per cent according to @entity176 's @entity175			1
but according to a report in @entity179 , some @entity14 researchers say forecasters are being too conservative			2
‘ one thing i hear over and over again is ' we do not want to create a panic ' , @entity181 of the @entity182 in @entity183 told the magazine			0
one reason is that forecasting a big @entity14 would increase food prices			2
‘ but it may be better to have this reaction at an early stage , when farmers can still adapt , rather than later , ’ he said			0
the worst @entity14 on record in 1997 to 1998 was blamed for massive flooding along @entity199 's @entity198 , pictured , that killed over 1,500 people			1
@entity176 climate experts claim the recent rises in sea temperature are above those seen in previous @entity14 years and suggest this year 's events will be ' significant ' researchers claim that @entity207 , which faces floods , is well prepared for emergencies			1
@entity210 is thought to have invested in water storage in event of a drought			0
scientists ' main concern is @entity216 , @entity217 and @entity176			1
the worst @entity14 on record in 1997 and 1998 was blamed for massive flooding along @entity199 's @entity198 , responsible for killing more than 1,500 people			1
a strong @entity14 also increases fears that production of many key agricultural commodities in @entity217 and @entity176 will suffer			1
strong @entity14 events occur every 20 years or so , but researchers recently said this could drop to 10 years thanks to global warming			1
here , the village of @entity229 , @entity230 , is seen flooded in january 2003 as a result of @entity14 rains , which drove 16,000 people from their homes the impact of this year 's @entity14 events is expected to be felt by every continent			2
during the 1997 to 1998 events , damages were said to have been in the region of between $ 35billion to $ 45billion			0
beachfront homes in @entity242 , @entity207 , pictured , collapsed after two weeks of high surf under @entity14 weather conditions extreme @entity14 events develop differently from standard @entity246 , which first appear in the @entity24			2
the extreme events occur when sea surface temperatures exceeding 28 ° c develop in the normally cold and dry eastern equatorial @entity24			0
this different location for the origin of the temperature increase causes massive changes in global rainfall patterns			2
the new patterns result in flash floods and torrential rain in some places and devastating droughts and wild fires in others			0
extreme @entity14 events are expected to double in frequency over the next 100 years			2
the impact of extreme @entity14 events is felt by every continent			2
in january , a team of international scientists said extreme weather events fuelled by unusually strong @entity246 are expected to double over the next century			2
climate scientists warned countries could be struck by devastating droughts , wild fires and dramatic foods approximately every ten years			0
the team , made up of experts from the @entity273 ( @entity274 ) , the @entity61 @entity62 and @entity275 , also spotted a link between global warming and extreme @entity14 events			1
‘ we currently experience an unusually strong @entity14 event every 20 years			2
our research shows this will double to one event every 10 years , ’ said @entity278 of @entity274 , who co-authored the study			0
‘ @entity14 events are a multi-dimensional problem and only now are we starting to understand better how they respond to global warming , ’ he added			1
extreme @entity14 events develop differently from standard @entity246 , which first appear in the @entity24			2
the extreme events occur when sea surface temperatures exceeding 28 ° c develop in the normally cold and dry eastern equatorial @entity24			0
scientists in @entity290 recently said they can forecast disruptive @entity14 events a year in advance			1
they hope the forecast will help countries develop better strategies to counter the effects such as wild fires , pictured in the @entity298			0
meteorologists said the prospect of a 2014 @entity14 will be firmed up ' in the next month or two ' this different location for the origin of the temperature increase causes massive changes in global rainfall patterns , which result in floods and torrential rain in some places and devastating droughts and wild fires in others			1
the impacts of extreme @entity14 events that extended to every continent across the globe in 1997 , for example , killed around 23,000 people			2
dr @entity317 continued : ‘ during an extreme @entity14 event countries in the @entity24 , such as @entity176 and @entity319 , experienced devastating droughts and wild fires , while catastrophic floods occurred in the eastern equatorial region of @entity322 and northern @entity230			1
’ in @entity176 , the drought and dry conditions caused by the 1982 and 1983 extreme @entity14 led to the @entity325 in southeast @entity176 , which resulted in 75 deaths			1
the scientists examined 20 climate models to simulate major rainfall reorganisation during extreme @entity14 events			1
this satellite image shows the @entity14 weather phenomena in 1997 , represented by the the white area at the equator , which shows how the warm waters stretch from @entity230 to @entity335			0

the combined average temperature over global land and ocean surfaces for april 2014 tied with 2010 as the highest on record
was 0.77 ° @entity7 ) above the 20th century average of @entity9 ( 56.7 ° f )
2014 @entity14 could be one of the strongest for decades
some scientists claim areas such as @entity348 , @entity217 and @entity176 will *struggle* to cope , as predictions on its *severity* are not accurate
