a huge family tree linking 13 million people could solve some longstanding mysteries about how some human traits are influenced by genes			1
a team of researchers at @entity7 , @entity8 , looked at 43 million public profiles on the genealogy website @entity11			1
public profiles on this site , which include that of @entity15 and @entity16 , reveal information such as location , birth dates and family links			1
' using this information , we constructed a single pedigree of 13 million individuals spanning many generations up to the 15th century and validated its quality using unilineal y chromosome and mitochondira markers , ' the authors wrote in the abstract to their study			1
the research has not yet been published , but as a proof of concept , the team analysed the immigration patterns of individuals in these family trees , displaying them graphically in a time lapse			1
@entity48 is a scientific resource of genealogical and demographic data from tens of millions of people mostly from the last 500 years			1
the starting point of @entity48 was the public information on @entity11 , a genealogy - driven social network that is operated by @entity23			1
@entity11 allows genealogists to enter their family trees into the website and to create profiles of family members			1
' the main advantage of @entity48 is its ultra-large pedigrees			1
the largest pedigree has 13 million individual , ' claims the site			2
' to the best of our knowledge , this is the largest pedigree compiled for scientific studies			2
‘ it ’s interesting to see the correlation between historical events and migration partners , ’ dr @entity24 told @entity71			2
' for instance , we know the @entity77 arrived in 1620 to @entity78 and we can see this in our data			2
’ anyone can log online and contribute their details to the website , but it may take a while before the results are condensed into useful information for genetic scientists			0
the names have been stripped from the data to protect privacy			2
‘ we have given the anonymous data to the wider scientific community to use in their projects , ’ dr @entity24 said			0
‘ there may be someone out there who can find things out from our data that we ’ve missed			0
’ anyone can log online and contribute their details to the website , but it may take a while before the results are condensed into useful information for genetic scientists the changes in certain traits can show how much a human characteristic is linked to genetics previous data available for genetic studies contained hundreds of thousands of family members at best			0
the work , presented by computational biologist @entity116 at the @entity118 annual meeting in @entity119 , could aid in the understanding of how genes contribute to certain traits			0
even more useful , however , is the possibility that this gene information could be linked to medical information			0
by comparing someone to their ancestors , the degree of change in certain traits can reveal how much that characteristic is linked to genetics			0
however , dr @entity24 admitted that the self - reported genealogical data may not be completely accurate			0
‘ we are not confident that it is all correct , ’ he said			0
‘ … the end point of this process is to advance our biomedical knowledge and data such as this can be hugely valuable			0

the data was compiled using 43 million public profiles on @entity11
record has now been made available on @entity48 for anyone to *download*
researchers have released a video showing migration patterns in the data
