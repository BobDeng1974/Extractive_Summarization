famed radio presenter @entity0 has again shocked listeners after he berated an elderly man who began to break down on air as he revealed he was sexually abused as a child			1
during the interview on thursday morning mr @entity0 called the elderly man - known as @entity7 - a ' wet blanket ' and suggested he should ' go to the pub and have a lemonade , for god sake '			1
mr @entity0 quipped and chuckled that it ' took a little while for you to get around to talk about it			2
' @entity7 then told mr @entity0 that he had in fact reported two instances to the police but he was told to ' go away and forget about it			1
no one would do anything about it			0
' it was at this stage mr @entity0 added insult to injury as he told 80 - year - old @entity7 that he should have fought the man off , as he himself had done when men had ' had a go ' at him when he was younger			1
the disgraced shock jock called the elderly man a ' wet blanket ' and suggested he should ' go to the pub and have a lemonade , for god sake '			1
' did you scream in fright ? did you yell out ' stop that you bastard ' ? did you lash out with your fists ? did you hit him ? ' @entity0 asked			2
a meek sounding @entity7 responded ' no , no probably not			2
' ' i do n't quite understand why you did n't lash out , you would have been a fairly big boy by that time			2
did n't you kick or yell or scream or hit ? ' mr @entity0 continued to press the issue and said he should have told his family or his boss , who it turns out was responsible for several of the assaults			1
@entity7 began to become audibly distressed at this stage when he explained he had no family support			2
' no , we never had any uh , there was no such thing as ... family love , ' @entity7 said			0
he explained that his abuse was a contributing factor to why he had no girlfriend , no romantic interests and very little human contact			0
repeat offender : mr @entity0 was criticised in 2013 after telling a female sexual assault victim that women who dress provocatively are ' rapebait ' mr @entity0 then tried to salvage the conversation saying he should have felt better after speaking to him and getting it off his chest			1
@entity7 responded that he was ' sad more than anything			0
' mr @entity0 then shockingly claimed the interview was a waste of ' both of their time			1
' @entity7 continued to open up about his years spent in isolation after the attacks , trying to minimise human contact when mr @entity0 thought it prudent to offer @entity7 some more sound advice			1
in a flood of support for @entity7 many twitter users have called for mr @entity0 to be sacked ' have you ever stopped and asked yourself , why do n't people like me ? ' you 're not the happiest soul , i do n't know that you 'd make people who are around you feel all that good			1
have you tried to brighten up a little ? difficult i know			0
' do you hear me ? but you 're not taking any notice			0
' you 've got to be responsible for your own activity			0
you must make the move , go and talk to somebody about it			0
' but do n't be down all the time , do n't be a wet blanket all the time			2
try and have a laugh			0
' go to the pub and have a lemonade for god sake			0
he was met with silence			0
' but do n't be down all the time , do n't be a wet blanket all the time			2
try and have a laugh			0
' ' no ? well there 's not a lot more i can do , is there ? ' to wrap up the uncomfortable ten minute conversation mr @entity0 asked @entity7 to thank him for his time			1
' @entity7 , could you say thank you ? ' the interview draws shocking parallels to a conversation mr @entity0 had with a female caller in 2013 who had also experienced sexual abuse			1
mr @entity0 blamed the victim and claimed that women who dressed provocatively were ' rape bait '			1
@entity117 has erupted in support for @entity7 as listeners call for the so - called radio magnate to be sacked			2
the twitter community rushed to condemn the actions of mr @entity0 labelling him a ' monster ' @entity124 , the former co-star of @entity125 ! who was among actor @entity126 ’ child sex abuse victims , chimed into show support for @entity7 and said she hopes he can see that there are people out there who do care			1
she added mr @entity0 needs ' genuine help ' after listening to the insensitive call			2
@entity124 wants @entity7 to know that he is n't alone and people do care @entity136 from @entity137 is among critics who say mr @entity0 should be taken off the air			1
' that man needs to hang up his hat , ' she told @entity142			0
she said the manner in which @entity7 was publically cut down after he had the ' courage to speak up ' was ' completely irresponsible and unacceptable '			0
' @entity7 , could you say thank you ? ' : mr @entity0 insisted @entity7 thank him at the end of the awkward conversation ‘ what we know is that 40 years ago child sexual assault was rarely talked about			1
children were told they made and any attempt they made to tell someone would have quite often been met with rejection , punishment or blame , ’ she added			0
' after a lifetime of living with fear , to hear somebody they trust and respect to speak to them like that			0
it just reinforces a life of thinking it was their fault			0
