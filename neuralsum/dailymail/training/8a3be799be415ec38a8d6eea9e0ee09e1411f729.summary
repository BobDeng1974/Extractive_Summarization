the prospect of an epic train journey from @entity2 to @entity3 might seem like a distant dream for those seeking the ultimate railway holiday			0
but booking a ticket from @entity8 to @entity9 could be a step closer after @entity11 gave the green light for plans for a 65 - mile tunnel under the @entity15			1
the @entity16 this week gave its support for a $ 99billion scheme that would link @entity19 and @entity20 and allow for a potential once - in - a - lifetime train journey			2
trip of a lifetime : the @entity16 has given the green light for a £ 60billion tunnel linking @entity26 to @entity27 through the @entity15 the views would be breathtaking : a snowmobile makes its away across the frozen tundra in @entity27 better wrap up warm : if the tunnel was ever built , the train journey would probably take the best part of three weeks in sub zero temperatures the proposed tunnel would pass underneath the @entity38 and @entity39 islands and straddle the international dateline to link @entity41 and @entity42			1
engineers have said there is no technical reason the tunnel could not be completed and it could provide a cheaper way of shipping freight around the world , the @entity43 reported			0
the idea was first raised by @entity52 in 1905 , but was this week endorsed by @entity54 - deputy federal representative for the @entity41 - at a conference on developing infrastructure in the country 's remote north - east			2
a dream too far ? the plans would see a 65 - mile tunnel , twice that of the @entity62 , bored through the international date line in the @entity15 ( pictured ) rejuvenation : @entity11 will open a £ 900million extension to the trans - siberian railway to @entity67 and could link to the north - eastern tip of @entity26 by 2030 an @entity42 train route would require both @entity11 and the @entity70 to construct railway lines in @entity26 and @entity27			1
currently , train services extend as far east as @entity73 or @entity74 in @entity11 , while you would need to take a ferry between @entity77 and @entity78 to get anywhere near the @entity15 on the @entity70 side			2
at present it would take just over two weeks to get as far along the route as physically possible			0
here 's how : @entity3 - @entity84 - @entity83 - @entity85 : 18hrs 30mins @entity85 - @entity73 : 106 hours train route from @entity73 to @entity78 @entity78 : 7 days - by ferry @entity88 - @entity77 : 2 hours @entity2 - @entity91 - @entity90 - @entity89 - @entity88 : 64hrs 30mins total journey time : 14 days 23 hours the three - day conference , held in the eastern city of @entity67 , brought delegates from the @entity70 , @entity96 and @entity97 and was aimed at capturing the economic potential of the resource - rich region			0
mr @entity54 told @entity43 : ' we should see advanced development of road and rail infrastructure here [ in the @entity41 ] and improvement in the investment climate in @entity11 as a key aim			1
' a 500 - mile railway line stemming from the existing @entity111 line to @entity67 - costing £ 900million and due for completion in 2013 - is part of @entity16 plans to extend rail lines 2,360 miles to the north - eastern tip of @entity26 by 2030			1
that could open up the way for the construction of a tunnel - which could take up to another 15 years to complete			0
the route would be twice the length of the @entity62 , in a sparsely populated area miles from large population centres			0
it would also require @entity70 engineers to create through train lines in @entity27 , linking it with cities in @entity129 and onwards			0
currently , travellers would have to get a ferry to @entity78 , @entity27 , from the @entity70 west coast and train services in @entity11 would only take you as far as @entity73 or @entity74 , before they move down into @entity96 and @entity135			2
it remains to be seen whether @entity11 could finance such an ambitious project , but it opens up the possibility of a breathtaking train journey through picturesque @entity26 and @entity27 .			1

trip of a lifetime would take the best part of three weeks through picturesque @entity27 and @entity26
@entity11 set to complete extension of rail *network* to tip of @entity26 by 2030
$ 99 billion plan would see 65 - mile tunnel bored under @entity15 and linking @entity41 and @entity42
