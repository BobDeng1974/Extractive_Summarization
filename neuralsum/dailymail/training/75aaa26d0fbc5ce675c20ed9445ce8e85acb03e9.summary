@entity0 grabbed a double as @entity1 comprehensively won the battle of two championship promotion hopefuls by brushing aside @entity4 4 - 0			1
@entity6 's side showed just why they are being so heavily tipped for a return to the @entity8 with a superb display that saw them rise to second in the table			0
in complete control from the moment @entity15 opened the scoring in the fifth minute , @entity1 took the points as @entity0 struck his eighth and ninth goals of the campaign prior to @entity20 completing the scoring			1
@entity20 ( right ) celebrates scoring @entity1 's fourth and final goal with his team - mates @entity0 ( right ) heads in @entity1 's third goal and his second of the night @entity0 steps up and converts a penalty to make it 2 - 0 to @entity1 after 33 minutes @entity28 ( right ) was left no chance in the @entity4 goal as @entity0 ( left ) scored anticipation was high at the @entity32 for a meeting of sides occupying play - off places			1
the hosts began in the ascendancy , @entity15 's header securing the perfect start			2
and @entity1 would not relinquish control thereafter , with @entity0 and @entity20 ensuring saturday 's clash with @entity42 would be a meeting of the top two			1
@entity6 's men started like a team brimming with confidence and could have taken the lead when @entity49 hit an early volley just over			0
but they did not have to wait much longer for an opener , @entity52 playing a lovely through - ball to @entity54 - whose cross left @entity56 with the simple task of diverting a diving header beyond @entity28			0
@entity4 came back into the game impressively , with the likes of @entity61 and @entity62 looking threatening			0
@entity15 opened the scoring for @entity1 ( centre ) with a header inside the box @entity15 ( right ) celebrates putting @entity1 ahead with his fourth goal of the season the pair almost teed up a leveller when good interplay ended with @entity61 finding @entity72 , only for the former @entity1 man to see his low effort turned around the post by @entity76			1
that set the tone for much of the opening period , with @entity62 volleying a golden chance over soon after			0
and @entity4 's failure to take advantage of those opportunities came back to haunt them as @entity0 sent @entity28 the wrong way after @entity86 had felled @entity87 in the box			2
@entity4 , who brought on @entity90 at the interval in an attempt to spark a turnaround , continued their dominance of possession early in the second period			0
yet their profligacy showed up again initially , with in - form striker @entity100 hitting wildly over the crossbar after being picked out by @entity90			0
@entity61 ( right ) plays a ball around @entity1 's @entity103 @entity4 's players ( from left ) @entity106 , @entity107 and @entity108 look dejected @entity1 would again find a foothold and @entity0 saw a deflected effort fly narrowly wide			2
@entity49 was next to threaten when forcing @entity28 into a fine reactionary save after unleashing a vicious low strike from 30 yards			2
@entity1 finally grabbed the third their dominance deserved , though , when @entity52 's wonderful chipped pass allowed @entity0 to loop a header over @entity28			1
@entity4 's heads dropped thereafter , with the home side continuing to look the more threatening			0
and a dreadful night for @entity120 ' men was capped when @entity28 mishandled @entity0 's corner to leave @entity20 to slide a fourth into the empty net .			1

@entity15 headed @entity1 in front after just five minutes
@entity0 then scored a penalty after a @entity128 foul
@entity0 grabbed a second goal before @entity20 scored the fourth
@entity1 now *joint* top of the @entity133 on 30 points
