a mistake from @entity2 keeper @entity1 on his debut allowed @entity6 ’s @entity5 midfielder @entity4 to score the only goal in his team ’s 1 - 0 win in @entity10			1
the @entity12 keeper had played well until he fumbled the long shot with 10 minutes left to give @entity15 ’s side victory over @entity17 ’s young team			1
@entity2 are still missing all three of their first choice strikers and without @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 they failed to turn some good football into goals and paid the price when @entity1 conceded late on			1
blunder : @entity4 's shot squeezes through the hands of @entity1 on wednesday night horror show : the @entity12 goalkeeper can only watch the ball drop into the net in @entity10 take that : @entity33 midfielder @entity4 could n't believe his luck after the goal disappointing : it has been anything but a perfect start at @entity2 for new boss @entity17 surrounded : @entity2 playmaker @entity38 looks to escape the attention of @entity6 players in their second pre-season friendly under their new coach @entity2 lined - up with a strong defence and a first - choice midfield but were missing all three of their star strikers			1
@entity1 started in goal behind @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51			0
and @entity52 took his place alongside @entity54 and captain @entity38 in midfield			0
but up front @entity56 played alongside 18 - year - old @entity58 and @entity59			0
it was @entity58 who had the best chance of the first half when played in by @entity52			0
he drew the advancing @entity64 but the @entity6 keeper stuck out a left arm to deflect the youngster ’s shot clear			2
@entity58 missed another one on one with @entity64 but was at least finding space with some intelligent running as @entity2 tried to break down @entity6 ’s well organised defence			1
making his mark : @entity52 started for the @entity74 giants in @entity10 crunch : @entity76 is caught on the knee by @entity78 - an awful tackle at the other end @entity1 showed good decision - making when he came out to smother the ball at @entity83 ’s feet and he also tipped away a @entity85 header from a @entity83 cross midway through the first half			0
@entity2 had enjoyed most of the possession in the first half but were missing the finishing @entity19 , @entity21 and @entity20 will bring them			1
@entity19 is now back in full training while @entity20 is still in the processing of recovering from the cracked vertebrae he suffered at the @entity93			1
@entity21 is due to appeal against his four - month @entity95 ban when he appears at the @entity96 on friday			1
another former @entity97 forward , @entity98 , came on for @entity6 in the second half replacing the @entity101 striker @entity100 ( who had worn the no 91 shirt in the first half )			0
@entity56 had the first chance of the second half shooting into the side netting from the edge of the area after @entity78 had headed clear			0
good start : @entity1 made a great save early on to on his first appearance for the club strong : centre back @entity49 looked to hold off opposing forward @entity100 the @entity112 forward then very nearly finished @entity2 ’s best move of the game			1
a 40 - yard cross-field pass from @entity49 was nudged back to @entity56 by @entity116 but again he shot into the side netting			2
@entity59 then shot from distance forcing another save from @entity64 but still the breakthrough did not come and on the hour @entity17 made six substitutions			2
@entity38 , @entity56 , @entity58 , @entity52 , @entity116 and @entity49 were replaced by midfielders @entity122 and @entity124 ; 19 - year - old forward @entity125 ; @entity127 ’s youngest ever debutant @entity126 , 18 - year - old full - back @entity128 and 20 - year - old @entity131 defender @entity130			0
@entity50 took the armband from @entity49 but when he was also taken off it changed hands for a third time with @entity48 now the oldest outfield @entity2 player on the pitch aged 23			2
in that second raft of changes former @entity140 loanee @entity139 came on and after @entity1 ’s mistake and it was left to him to lead the charge for the equaliser but @entity64 saved his shot after he cleverly room for himself in the area			2
@entity139 then sent over a dangerous cross but @entity98 cleared as @entity6 held on for the win			0
@entity152 : @entity48 does well to keep up with @entity153			0

@entity4 shot slips through the *fingers* of @entity12 goalkeeper
*stopper* was *signed* from @entity160 this *summer* after @entity93
