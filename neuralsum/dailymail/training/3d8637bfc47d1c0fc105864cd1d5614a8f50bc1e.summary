@entity64 went down to a surprise 1 - 0 defeat that november afternoon , and ended up runners - up in @entity124 to @entity125			0

probably the most famous line he uttered in football commentary came in 1974 , when @entity125 's @entity161 scored against @entity162 - ' interesting ... very interesting			1
just look at his face			0
' the presenter most associated with @entity25 for a certain generation must be @entity58 , who fronted the programme between 1973 and 1988			1
the former @entity170 and @entity172 forward , and @entity173 manager , had worked for @entity174 before joining the @entity27			1

during the 1980 - 81 and 1982 - 83 seasons , the programme was moved to a sunday afternoon , but for the vast majority of its history , @entity25 has remained a saturday night show the years and decades come and go , and yet there is still one constant with @entity25 - the voice of @entity131			1

@entity207 commentated for the programme for 35 years - his first was for @entity209 vs @entity146 in august , 1969			0
that week 10 years ago , @entity152 said : ' it is not easy to give up something that has been a major part of my working life but i think i have had a good innings			2
' @entity25 has surely never had a more unflappable host than @entity59			0
when the @entity27 won back rights to show top - flight football in 1992 , @entity59 was in his element , and fronted the famous highlights programme every saturday night			1
@entity47 , once a cultured defender with @entity64 and @entity220 , became the most recognisable pundit - and he uttered probably the most famous line in @entity25 history in 1995 when he was talking about a defeat for @entity146 at @entity225 and said ' you ca n't win anything with kids '			0
