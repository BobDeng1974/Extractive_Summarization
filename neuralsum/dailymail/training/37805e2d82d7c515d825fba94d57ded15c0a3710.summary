unfortunately for one trumpeting busker in @entity7 , a passer - by lost his appetite for his playing to the extent that he subjected him to a four - minute rant , unleashing a symphony of expletives in the process			1
footage of the outburst has gone viral on @entity18 , amassing over 300,000 views at the time of writing			1
he said : ‘ you suck ! get out			2

you ’re a mediocre piece of s * * *			1
get the f * * * out			1
how dare you come down here and do this			2
’ the musician wearily leans against a wall during the verbal abuse and at one point plays a few notes on his instrument , but gives up when the unnamed passer - by makes to hit him with a bag			1
anger : the trumpet player initially tries to argue back but eventually just waits for the passer - by to finish his outburst frustration : after a short while the man pauses long enough to throw his bag down in anger the trumpeter , after asking the irate man to leave , walks away out of shot but this does nothing to appease his attacker , who stands in front of the person filming and carries on shouting			1
he said : ‘ you any kind of artist ? anybody know who you are ? you ’re a no - talent piece of s * * *			1
how dare you come down here and do this			2
