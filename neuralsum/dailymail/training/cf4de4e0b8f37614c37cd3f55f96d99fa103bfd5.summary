the mystery surrounding @entity3 dictator @entity2 's disappearance from the spotlight deepened today when he failed to show for a @entity6 anniversary celebration			1
it was the first time in three years @entity2 had n't attended the event in @entity9 , which today marked the party 's 69th anniversary			1
but while @entity2 was n't there in person , a flower basket with his name on it was placed before statues of his father and grandfather , both of whom also ruled @entity21			2
the 31 - year - old has n't been seen in public since september 3			1
he had been walking with a limp and was more overweight than usual in images that aired before that			0
an official documentary from late last month described him as dealing with ' discomfort ' , which led to international speculation that he may be ill. in @entity61 , @entity60 spokesman @entity59 said that @entity2 appears to still be in charge of key affairs			2
he noted that a high - level @entity3 delegation conveyed a greetings message to @entity67 president @entity66 during their surprise visit to @entity67 last week			1
state media , later reported @entity2 was suffering from unspecified ' discomfort '			0
sources have claimed the dictator had hurt his leg when he joined generals he had ordered to perform physical drills , and required 100 days to recover			0
@entity21 has said nothing publicly about @entity2 's absence			1
but it is not the first time he has taken a break from the media spotlight - @entity2 was n't seen publicly for about three weeks in 2012 , @entity67 officials say			1
he is un-well : the @entity3 leader has not been seen in public for more than a month because he pulled a tendon while exercising with his generals , a source with access to the dictatorship previously said because @entity9 is publicly acknowledging @entity2 's ' discomfort ' , many analysts believe that he 's unlikely to be suffering from anything particularly serious			1
when his father , @entity32 , suffered major health problems late in his rule , state media said nothing			0
but each day that passes only adds to the speculation			0
@entity2 missed a meeting of the country 's parliament late last month , and was absent again from a gathering this week to mark his late father 's election as ruling party head			2
@entity108 , a professor at @entity110 's @entity109 and an authority on @entity3 affairs , appeared to suggest ms @entity113 had taken control			2
he told @entity115 : ' @entity2 's sister may be young , but she has taken up some of the key leadership positions in @entity21 , relying on the family name and bloodline to have her instructions carried out			1
' no - one can touch the @entity2 family and it does n't matter that she is young , inexperienced and a woman			2
she is a @entity2 and that 's enough			2
' according to @entity67 's @entity126 , ms @entity113 is already in charge of her brother 's daily schedule , ' as well as coordinating every detail of his fashion and hair style '			2
health fear : @entity2 has rapidly gained weight since coming to power after his father died of a heart attack in 2011 prior to the emergence of the latest claims , a source with access to the secretive @entity3 's leadership insisted @entity2 was in firm control of his government , playing down speculation over his health and grip on power			1
the source said that @entity2 had just taken a step out of the limelight because of his leg injury			0
' he ordered all the generals to take part in drills and he took part too , ' the source told @entity158 on condition of anonymity			0
' they were crawling and running and rolling around , and he pulled a tendon			0
' he injured his ankle and knee around late august or early september while drilling because he is overweight			0
' he limped around in the beginning but the injury worsened , ' the source said			0
@entity2 , who has rapidly gained weight since coming to power after his father died of a heart attack in 2011 , had been seen walking with a limp since an event with key officials in july , which would imply he may have aggravated an earlier injury			0
he was last seen attending a concert with his wife @entity177 on september 3 but has vanished from public since @entity2 has not been pictured by state media , which chronicles his whereabouts in great detail , since september 3 ' the longer he remains out of the public eye , the more uncertainty about him , and the status of his regime , will grow , ' said @entity186 , a researcher at the @entity188 - @entity187 at the @entity189 in @entity190			1
@entity3 officials have denied that @entity2 's public absence since early september is health - related and a @entity188 official following @entity21 said this week there were no indications he was seriously ill or in political trouble			1
speculation that @entity2 's unusually long absence from public view may be due to ill health was fuelled by a @entity3 tv report late last month that said he was suffering from ' discomfort '			1
some @entity9 watchers also suggest that @entity2 may have been sidelined in a power struggle , a scenario they say was reinforced by the unexpected visit on saturday of a high - level delegation to the closing ceremony of the @entity211 in @entity212 , @entity67			1
another interpretation of that visit holds that it was meant to convey stability in @entity9			0
the source with knowledge of @entity2 's health said rumours of a coup were ' rubbish '			1
' it would have to be a very subtle coup indeed not to disrupt international travel plans , ' said @entity223 of the @entity224 , a @entity226 - based @entity225 running a programme for @entity21 in @entity228			0
@entity21 is a hereditary dictatorship centred on the ruling @entity2 family			2
@entity2 's sister , @entity41 , is known to have an official role within the ruling party			1
his brother , @entity234 , and his estranged half - brother are not in the public eye			0
shots fired across border after activists urge @entity21 to rise up against ' dictator ' @entity2 @entity3 exchanged machinegun fire today after the communist state took objection to balloons loaded with leaflets condemning @entity2			1
no casualties were reported in the exchange of fire , a sign of the tensions which sill exist between the two states			0
they remain legally at war and are separated by the @entity255 , known as the @entity256			0
@entity3 defectors launched balloons from the @entity67 today to send across leaflets and dvds condemning the regime of @entity2 , as well as @entity188 dollars the balloons carried bags of leaflets and @entity265 underneath			1
but they prompted @entity3 border troops to fire across the border , which led to an exchange of fire @entity67 activists had sent leaflets critical of the @entity3 regime flying into the @entity3 from the town , prompting shots to be fired by the @entity3 's guards to try to bring down the balloons			1
@entity67 's military returned fire after hearing the sound of the @entity3 's machinegun fire , the official said			2
some rounds fell on the @entity286 which then responded with high - calibre machine gun fire ' towards the @entity3 's guard posts , ' a defence ministry spokesman said			2
there was a further exchange of fire 10 minutes later , he added			0
local residents of @entity293 in the border area of @entity295 were evacuated to shelters as a precaution			0
while naval confrontations along the @entity302 ' disputed maritime border occur from time to time , any military engagement across the heavily - militarised land frontier is extremely rare			0
in 2010 , the @entity3 shelled the @entity67 border island of @entity304 , killing four people and briefly sparking fears of a full scale conflict			2
the balloon launch from @entity309 was one of several planned to coincide with @entity21 's celebration today of the 69th anniversary of its ruling @entity6			1
@entity61 allowed the exercises to go ahead , despite prior warnings from @entity9 of ' catastrophic ' consequences			0
some of the balloons carried messages denouncing @entity3 leader @entity2 , who has not seen seen in public for more than a month			1
@entity21 has reacted angrily to leaflet drops by @entity67 private groups that carried messages attacking the authoritarian leadership in @entity9 , vowing to attack them but has never taken action to follow up on the threat			1
' this is the first time @entity21 actually took an action against leaflets			0
it spilt cold water over the @entity331 relationship after the high - level delegation visit from @entity3			0
it will strain the relations again , ' said @entity334 , a professor at the @entity335 , said			0
on tuesday , a @entity67 naval ship fired warning shots after a @entity3 patrol boat crossed a disputed sea border off the peninsula 's west coast and fired shots back before retreating , a @entity67 defence official said			1
there were no casualties on the @entity67 side and none of the shots by either side was aimed at the other 's vessel , he told @entity158			2
evidence of the shots fired by @entity21 could be seen on the southern side of the @entity255 which separates the two states , including this bullet hole ( centre )			1
both sides are technically still at war			0
