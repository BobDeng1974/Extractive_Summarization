by @entity0 @entity1 , 2 , died after being misdiagnosed a toddler died from a bacterial throat infection after his gp sent him home with @entity5			1
two - year - old @entity1 had complained of a sore throat and was given the paracetamol - based painkiller on the advice of his doctor and @entity11			1
but they had failed to spot he was suffering from @entity13 , a bacterial infection that is experiencing a surge in @entity15			1
it escalated into a fatal abscess that ruptured a major blood vessel in @entity1 ’s throat			1
he was eventually admitted to hospital but died from a ‘ catastrophic bleed ’ two days later			1
at an inquest , assistant coroner @entity23 said she would write to health secretary @entity25 calling for better guidelines on how to spot @entity27 , which was ‘ very difficult to diagnose ’			1
the court heard the infection is on the rise and could prove fatal when left untreated			0
paediatric consultant dr @entity31 told the hearing : ‘ there used to be an epidemic where thousands of children would die , but now we are going through a surge and there are no national guidelines on @entity27 and its high mortality rate			0
it is on the increase and higher than we would usually expect			0
’ @entity1 ’s parents , chartered accountant @entity44 , 34 , and @entity45 , 35 , wept as they listened to the evidence at @entity47			2
the court heard their son was a ‘ healthy and happy ’ boy who had only been to the doctor for minor illnesses			0
but on september 21 , 2012 , @entity1 awoke crying			2
mrs @entity45 , from @entity52 , @entity53 , told the inquest that he pointed to his mouth to show where it hurt			2
@entity1 and his father , chartered accountant @entity58 , 34 , before @entity1 died from a bleed in his throat when @entity1 woke up crying his father @entity44 , left , and mother @entity45 , right , rang @entity11 for advice after days of worry , @entity1 's parents took him to a gp , fearing he had meningitis , but were told to give him @entity5 ‘ he did n’t seem himself , but no worse than a cold and at that stage he was still eating , but not quite as well as normal , ’ she added			1
@entity1 developed a rash on his stomach and his parents called @entity11 , which suggested giving him @entity5 and told them it was most likely a virus			1
mrs @entity45 said : ‘ over the course of the week he was still not himself			0
he was not our usual boy			0
’ on september 24 , mrs @entity45 took @entity1 to their gp fearing he had meningitis , but was again told to give him @entity5			1
after showing no significant improvement and developing a red tongue , @entity1 was admitted to hospital on september 30			2
he was initially treated for viral tonsillitis , but doctors later realised it was a bacterial ‘ strep ’ infection			1
he was put on intravenous antibiotics and showed signs of recovery and was sent home from hospital			0
but on october 5 , his condition worsened and he was rushed to @entity92 ’s @entity91 department			0
he died before doctors could conduct an ultrasound on his throat , which would have revealed the retropharyngeal abscess , which ruptured a blood vessel			2
the inquest revealed that @entity99 , paediatricians and ear , nose and throat specialists failed to recognise the infection because it was easily mistaken for many other illnesses , including viral tonsillitis			2
after a few days of quiet crying from @entity1 , he was eventually admitted to hospital and treated for viral tonsillitis , only for doctors to realise it was a bacterial infection and put him on intravenous antibiotics in a statement read to the court , specialist dr @entity113 said the catastrophic bleed @entity1 suffered as a result of the abscess is incredibly rare			1
he pointed to one case in @entity120 but said there had been none in this country			0
recording a verdict of death by natural causes , coroner mrs @entity23 called for ‘ mandatory paediatric training for @entity99 ’			0
her report and recommendations will be sent to the @entity130 , the @entity131 and the @entity132			0
following treatment at the hospital reducing @entity1 's symptoms , he was sent home to recover a few days later following his second admission to hospital after his condition worsened , doctors were making plans to give him an ultrasound to detect the problems in his throat , when he died of a bleed due to the abscess an inquest labelled @entity1 's death a passing by natural causes , but the coroner pledged to contact the government to try and improve guidelines around strep infections			1
in addition , his parents have been raising money for the children 's ward at @entity162 hospital			0
