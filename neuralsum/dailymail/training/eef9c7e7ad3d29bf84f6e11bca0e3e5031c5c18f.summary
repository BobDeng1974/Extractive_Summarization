by @entity0 published : 17:18 est , 9 september 2012 updated : 02:00 est , 10 september 2012 @entity1 said that he never supported the @entity3 movement because he thought that the group had too many issues and not enough direction			2
the rapper 's criticism of the political protests seems particularly striking considering he briefly sold t - shirts that played on the cause 's name but did n't donate anything back to the organizers			1
in an interview with @entity18 author @entity17 for the @entity19 , the rapper said that he never supported the wealth inequality protests in spite of his attempts to cash in on their popularity			2
empty message : though he changed the t - shirts so they read ' @entity26 ' many criticized @entity1 ( right , seen with occupy - supporter @entity28 , left ) for not donating any of the profits back to the movement he said that after producer @entity28 , who was an ardent occupy - supporter , called him to enlist ' @entity1 ' to make an appearance at the protest tent grounds , he rejected the offer on the grounds that he did n't know what the movement was about			1
' i ’m not going to a park and picnic , i have no idea what to do , i do n’t know what the fight is about			0
what do we want , do you know ? ' he supposedly told @entity28 at the time			0
during the @entity19 interview , the rapper whose real name is @entity1 , said that once he got a sense of what the @entity50 stood for , he took issue with the portion of their argument that derides the success of the wealthy ' 1 percenters '			1
' i think all those things need to really declare themselves a bit more clearly			0
because when you just say that " the 1 per cent is that , " that ’s not true , ' he said			0
' yeah , the 1 per cent that ’s robbing people , and deceiving people , these fixed mortgages and all these things , and then taking their home away from them , that ’s criminal , that ’s bad			0
this is what @entity74 is built on			0
' considering @entity1 has worked his way up from living in poverty and working as a drug dealer to accruing an estimated personal wealth of $ 460million , it comes as no surprise that he takes issue with slamming of the self - made - man			1
99 problems : the rapper said that the protesters did n't specify their cause enough to make an impact this is not the first run - in that @entity1 had with the movement as his clothing company @entity93 had to stop selling his t - shirts that played off the protest 's name and changed it to read ' @entity97 ' once they received bad publicity after he admitted that there were no plans to donate any of the proceeds to the associated group			1
when they were sold , the cotton t - shirts were going for $ 22 each			1
at the time , @entity105 spoke with an occupy leader identified only as @entity107 who said : ' @entity1 , as talented as he is , has the political sensibility of a hood rat and is a scrotum			2
' ' to attempt to profit off of the first important social moment of 50 years with an overpriced piece of cotton is an insult to the fight for economic civil rights known as # occupywallstreet			0

@entity1 criticized occupy @entity119 because he took issue with their *blasts* against the wealthy
the rapper , worth an estimated $ 460million , said it was *wrong* to fight against entrepreneurs
got in trouble when he made ' @entity26 ' t - shirts and did n't donate any of the profits to the protest movement
