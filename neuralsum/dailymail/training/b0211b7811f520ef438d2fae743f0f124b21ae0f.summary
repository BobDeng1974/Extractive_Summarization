by @entity0 an @entity2 man who ditched his day job and used his expertise as a patent lawyer to create the ' world 's smallest washing machine ' - wo n't be returning to work any time soon			1
fed - up with having to pack large suitcases full of clothes when he travelled - @entity12 came up with an idea , over a few beers in an @entity16 pub , to invent a durable and lightweight washing machine that travellers the world over could use			1
it was a few weeks prior to his trip to @entity22 , back in 2012 , that mr @entity12 spawned the idea of the @entity24 - and now the product has gone global			1
' i 'm selling tens of thousands of units , ' mr @entity12 said			2
employed as a patent lawyer , mr @entity12 was working for clients who had big ideas and decided he wanted to create his own			1
he originally had plans to sell his idea to big manufacturers , but when noone picked it up because they thought it was too ridiculous , he went it alone			0
he created a three - month crowd funding page to prove the @entity24 could hold its own , and netted a whopping $ 25000			2
mr @entity12 was convinced that his life as a lawyer was over and followed his entrepreneurial pursuits , so he went ahead with creating the 145 - gram product which folds down in to roughly the size of a can of coke , without his partner			1
he said his friend pulled the pin when @entity24 , which is just 52 centimetres but remarkably can hold up to 13 litres of water , got serious because he ' was n't prepared to quit his job			2
' that man is now kicking himself			0
mr @entity12 has sold the product , which sells for $ 64.95 , to distributors and individuals in more than 50 countries the invention , which @entity69 listed as one of its ' 10 greatest travel products ' in 2012 , has travelled with mr @entity12 across three continents and has sold to distributors and individuals across 50 countries			1
he is confident the product , which sells for $ 64,95 , is on the verge of being picked up by a major @entity77 camping retailer			0
mr @entity12 said at the outset he was n't looking for fame or fortune , he just happened to find a hole in the market and came up with the invention that he would use every time he went travelling			2
' i was about to climb @entity85 and did n't want to pack all these bulky items , ' he said			0
' i knew i 'd be washing almost every day , and in @entity88 there are no wash facilities , not even a sink			0
' he said he : ' wanted to create something that was as gentle on clothes as hand washing ' so came up with an idea of an incredibly flexible thin washboard , welded inside a bag			0
mr @entity12 has used his expertise in patent law to secure patents in @entity2 and @entity101 , and patents pending in another 52 countries			1
@entity104 , general manager of @entity105 , an international supplier of goods to the recreational vehicle and marine industries , says new innovations such as the @entity24 have dramatically changed the camping industry and will continue to do so			0
' portable showers , washing machines and refrigerators have all been game - changers , ' he told the @entity115 .			0
