@entity9 @entity8 married @entity10 , from @entity11 , in an attempt to stay in @entity13 after his visa expired			1
the fraud went undetected for eight months - until police raided the house of the fixer who had arranged the fake marriage and found the notes used by the couple to learn their lines			1

the ' couple ' wed at @entity40 registry office in north @entity41 in march 2011 , because @entity8 needed to marry an @entity43 citizen to avoid being deported from the @entity13 when his visa expired			1
they claimed that had met in a coffee shop on @entity48 in june 2010 and had been living together for six months before the wedding			1
but in fact , they were introduced by ' fixer ' @entity53 , 43 , who was described by a judge at @entity56 @entity55 as having a ' svengali - like malign influence ' over the bride			2
when police raided @entity53 's home in @entity62 , @entity63 they discovered notes helping @entity8 and @entity65 learn facts about each other in order to convince officials that their marriage was genuine			1
at the bottom of the crib sheet , @entity53 had written : ' that is about it honey			2

@entity88 , prosecuting , told the couple that the three defendants went to the registry office a month before the wedding to answer questions about their relationship , with @entity53 claiming to act as their interpreter			0
however , when the crib sheets were discovered later that year it became clear that the wedding was in fact ' a sham , bogus marriage ' , she continued			1
' mr @entity8 's mother organised with mr @entity53 that he would secure a fake marriage so he could stay here as the husband of an @entity43 national , ' ms @entity88 said			1
' it was an entire put - up job planned for mr @entity8 to stay in this country when his visa ran out in may 2011			2
' she said that @entity10 , who first came to @entity13 in 2000 , had previously been in a relationship with @entity53			1
when he was questioned by police , @entity53 said he had been ' intimate ' with the bride but said that she had introduced @entity8 to him as her boyfriend , adding that he did not get on with the groom			1

' scam : @entity53 , left , set up the fake wedding for @entity8 , centre , and @entity65 , right @entity10 told the police she met @entity8 in @entity125 or @entity126 and that he had proposed to her on her birthday , sending her a card with the words ' will you marry me ? ' written inside			1
she also said it was a genuine marriage , but said he had ' upped and gone ' and she did not know where he was			0
@entity8 had been arrested in @entity134 for an unrelated offence around the time of the raid on @entity53 's house - he originally stuck to the story , but once he was shown the crib sheet he confessed it was a sham marriage			1
@entity10 , @entity8 and and @entity53 all pleaded not guilty to conspiracy to breach immigration laws by arranging a bogus marriage , but were convicted by a jury			1

@entity10 's lawyer said yesterday : ' it is a sad and desperate case for her			0
there was no gain in financial terms			0
the only explanation is that it was a misguided attempt by @entity65 to assist			0
she paid the wedding expenses			0
' she is ashamed to be here and is ashamed by the finding of the jury			0
she has always worked and never claimed benefit			0
' judge @entity163 said : ' the sole purpose of the sham marriage was to allow @entity8 to remain in the @entity13 through his marriage to an @entity43 national			2
