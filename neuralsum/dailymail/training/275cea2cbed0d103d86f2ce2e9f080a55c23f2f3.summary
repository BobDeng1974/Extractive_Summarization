changes in cloud patterns could reveal the final resting place of missing @entity5 flight @entity3 , according to an @entity7 scientist			1
@entity8 says that @entity3 's path could be revealed by analysing satellite images of clouds , as their patterns are changed by planes ' ' contrails ' – or condensation trails - interacting with them			1
in other words , every plane leaves breadcrumbs			2
mr @entity8 ' expertise with cloud patterns is yet to be used in the hunt for @entity3 despite a massive multi-national search operation , not even ' a seat cushion ' from the jet has been found it comes as @entity35 satellite company @entity34 admitted that there is still ' significant doubt ' over the location of @entity3			1
mr @entity8 , who 's head of the @entity7 environmental consultancy company @entity40 , wrote to the @entity5 high commissioner @entity41 at the beginning of april and offered to help with the search effort , according to @entity44			1
he said : ' i believe that we have a realistic chance to follow the flight path of @entity3 and follow its flight direction , possibly identifying its landing or crash site			1
' i believe that we will be able to utilise our expertise and identify the flight pass of @entity3 and then to direct the search and rescue authorities to save or recover @entity3 passengers			1
' however , he was told ' thanks , but no thanks ' by the @entity5 authorities , so instead sent his proposal to the @entity62 ( @entity22 )			2
they were more interested but the two sides reached an impasse			2
the @entity22 had several questions about mr @entity8 's techniques that mr @entity8 refused to answer for fear of his commercial interests being compromised			1
as a result , no trajectories for @entity3 have been produced by mr @entity8			1
@entity8 says that @entity3 's path could be revealed by analysing satellite images of clouds			1
pictured is the same model of 777 as the doomed flight the @entity79 search vessel , pictured , will spend a further year searching for the aircraft 's wreckage @entity34 , meanwhile , which has been at the heart of the search for @entity3 , produced a report recently that left a question mark over whether the plane is even in the ocean			1
writing in @entity89 , it said that while it believes ' @entity3 changed course and … travelled in a southerly direction until it ran out of fuel in the southern @entity94 , west of @entity25 ' , it stressed that ' the sensitivity of the reconstructed ﬂight path to frequency errors is such that there remains significant uncertainty in the final location '			1
the @entity102 - bound @entity101 lost contact with air traffic controllers after taking off with 239 on board from @entity106 on march 8			0
however , it transmitted signals to @entity34 's @entity110 satellite , leading the company 's analysts to conclude that it continued to fly ' for several hours after loss of contact '			1
the @entity22 said : ' all the evidence - based on independent analysis of satellite , radar and aircraft performance data from many international experts - indicates the aircraft entered the sea close to a long but narrow arc in the southern @entity94			0
' the ship discovery , provided by @entity125 contractor @entity79 , was scheduled to arrive in the search zone about 1,800 kilometers ( 1,100 ) miles west of @entity25 on wednesday , the @entity22 said in a statement			0
the @entity128 , a @entity5 ship that has been combing the area since early october , is in the @entity7 city of @entity132 getting fresh supplies			1
@entity5 defense minister @entity134 , who was in @entity25 to greet the @entity128 during its return to port , said everything possible was being done to find the @entity101 , which inexplicably disappeared on march 8 during a flight from @entity106 to @entity102 with 239 people on board			0
' we must continue to hope because sometimes hope is all we have , ' he said			0
' we will find @entity3			1
' the search ships are dragging sonar devices called towfish through the water about 100 meters ( 330 feet ) above the seabed to hunt for the wreckage			0
the towfish , which are also equipped with jet fuel sensors , transmit data in real - time to those on board the vessels			0
the underwater search resumed in early october after being on hold for four months while crews mapped the seabed in the 60,000 - square kilometer ( 23,000 - square mile ) search zone			2
the @entity128 has searched over 1,200 square kilometers ( 460 square miles ) so far			0
despite a massive air and sea search , not a single piece of debris from the plane has been found			0
@entity7 officials are still receiving reports from people who believe they have found wreckage washed up along the @entity7 coastline , but all have been false alarms			1
drift modeling by the @entity174 has shown any floating debris would likely have traveled west , away from @entity25			0
because of that , @entity25 asked @entity179 officials to be on the lookout for any wreckage , as it is possible some may have drifted to the island nation 's coastline , the transport safety bureau said			0
meanwhile , a third ship , the @entity185 , is still mapping areas of the search zone and will join the hunt once that is complete , likely in the next week or so			0
@entity191 ceo and president sir @entity190 , pictured , said he believes @entity3 was ' under control until the end ' the search is expected to take up to a year			1
the chief executive of @entity191 earlier claimed that ' control was taken of ' @entity3 before it vanished			2
sir @entity190 said it was very important that the airline industry does not accept that the fate of @entity3 is an ' unexplained mystery '			2
his airline , @entity191 , operates almost 130 @entity101 aircraft , similar to the doomed jet			0
in an interview with @entity207 magazine @entity206 , @entity190 said : ' @entity3 remains one of the great aviation mysteries			2
personally , i have the concern that we will treat it as such and move on			0
at the most , it might then make an appearance on @entity215 as one of aviation 's great mysteries			0
we must n't allow this to happen			0
we must know what caused that airplane to disappear			0
' he added : ' @entity3 was , in my opinion , under control , probably until the very end			2

cloud expert @entity8 says that @entity3 can be traced using its ' contrail '
the @entity7 scientist said archived images of clouds could hold the key
he said @entity3 will have changed cloud patterns and left breadcrumbs
@entity34 said there is still ' significant doubt ' over the location of @entity3
