by @entity0 published : 14:30 est , 15 february 2013 updated : 14:32 est , 15 february 2013 farmers believe labourers from @entity3 and @entity4 are likely to desert the strawberry fields for better paid and more comfortable work in towns and cities farmers fear a strawberry shortage next summer because of the lifting of immigration rules for @entity4 and @entity3 , it was revealed today			1
they believe 22,000 agricultural labourers from the two countries who currently work as summer fruit pickers are likely to desert the strawberry fields for better paid and more comfortable work in towns and cities			1
as a result shops and supermarkets are at risk of running short of strawberries and other seasonal crops because there will be too few workers to harvest them			1
the threat of a shortage of fruit pickers was disclosed by @entity31 immigration adviser professor @entity30			1
professor @entity32 said the @entity33 is pressing for a relaxation of immigration rules to allow tens of thousands of agricultural workers from outside @entity37 to come into @entity38 to replace the lost @entity3 and @entity4 workforce			1
citizens of the two eastern @entity37 countries which joined the @entity42 in 2007 will be free to come to @entity38 and work without restriction from january next year			2
even though the lifting of migration and labour barriers against @entity48 and workers from seven other eastern @entity37 countries in 2004 brought between a million and a million and a half workers to @entity38 , @entity44 has yet to produce estimates of the numbers of @entity4 and @entity3 who may arrive			2
at present , 21,750 @entity4 and @entity3 come into this country for six months of the year under the terms of the @entity56			2
the end of restrictions on the jobs these workers can take mean that many may decide to pursue other work in @entity38			0
professor @entity32 , the chairman of the @entity31 's @entity63 , said : ' the question is , in 2014 , when @entity4 and @entity3 get completely free access to the labour market , will they decide that they would rather go to work in hotels , or pubs , or @entity69 , and therefore will there be enough people to pick the strawberries ? ' farmers are wanting a scheme from outside the @entity42 at a time when we have 25 million unemployed in the @entity42			1
it 's a difficult one			0
who 's going to pick the strawberries ? ' at present , 21,750 @entity4 and @entity3 come into the @entity38 for six months of the year under the terms of the @entity56 professor @entity32 said his committee had not been asked to estimate numbers who might come from @entity4 and @entity3 , although he said he did expect @entity84 to request information on why many employers prefer workers from @entity37 to @entity38 workers			0
he said : ' my understanding is that the @entity92 - commissioned report from the @entity93 goes through a lot of interesting economic stuff , but does n't have numbers			0
' the @entity63 recommended that immigration rules on skilled migrants from outside @entity37 should be widened to allow in more engineers , including nuclear safety engineers to work in the decommissioning of old nuclear power stations , and railway signalling engineers to work on @entity103 and @entity104			0
it also said there were shortages in @entity38 of chicken sexers and computer games designers			0
however , successful training in the medical profession over the past decade means there are now enough @entity38 - educated brain surgeons and other consultants , the committee 's report said .			0

@entity31 adviser says the @entity33 wants *non-europeans* to be allowed to replace the lost workforce
