@entity0 has admitted its @entity2 service was to blame for the theft of hundreds of celebrity pictures			0
the firm said it was ' outraged ' by the attacks , and said they were the result of ' a very targeted attack on user names , passwords and security questions '			1
it advised worried customers to update their accounts with a ' strong ' password and enable two - step verification			1
experts say worried consumers should turn on two - step verification for their @entity2 account			1
the tool prevents people accessing accounts - even if they have the password			1
to set up two - step verification , go to my @entity0 @entity33 manage your @entity0 id and sign in , then select @entity37			0
under two - step verification , select get started and follow the onscreen instructions			0
when a user sets up two - step verification , they register one or more trusted devices			0
a trusted device is one that can receive 4 - digit verification codes using either @entity46 or @entity47			0
' our customers ’ privacy and security are of utmost importance to us , ' it said in a statement			1
' we wanted to provide an update to our investigation into the theft of photos of certain celebrities			0
' when we learned of the theft , we were outraged and immediately mobilized @entity0 ’s engineers to discover the source			0
' ' after more than 40 hours of investigation , we have discovered that certain celebrity accounts were compromised by a very targeted attack on user names , passwords and security questions , a practice that has become all too common on the @entity70			1
' none of the cases resulted from any breach in any of @entity0 ’s systems including @entity2 or find my @entity47 , the firm said			2
@entity77 revealed that hackers could have gained access to celebrity @entity2 accounts using just an email address and a search engine			2
@entity0 's password reset system for accounts has become the latest target in the hunt to find out how nude photos of @entity88 and ' 100 other celebrities ' were leaked			1
' we are continuing to work with law enforcement to help identify the criminals involved			0
' the system allows people to reset a password by answering two security questions - the answers to which can often be found online for celebrity users			1
the reset system allows those who have forgotten their password to reset it by answering a series of questions			1
users are asked to first confirm their date of birth - which is straightforward to find online they are then offered two options - to change their password using email authentication or by answering security questions hackers are believed to have used @entity2 's password reset function to gain access to accounts			1
this allows users to reset their password by entering their username , date of birth and correctly answering two security questions			1
experts say this information should be relatively easy to find for celebrities			1
@entity0 has admitted it is ' actively investigating ' claims a flaw in the ' @entity47 ' function of its @entity2 service may have helped a hacker to steal the photos			0
today it emerged hackers may also have used the service 's password reset function to gain access to accounts			1
this allows users to reset their password by entering their username , date of birth and correctly answering two security questions			1
experts say this information should be relatively easy to find for celebrities			1
@entity0 does email users to tell them their password has been changed			1
however , on the @entity141 hacking messageboard , those who say they have used the method claim that it 's often best to reset the password at night so that the password reset email can be read and deleted before the target is awake			1
@entity145 , a security expert with @entity146 , warned celebrities not to use the real answers to these questions as hackers would be able to find many of the answers online			1
' the key is not to put the real answers to these questions , ' he told @entity77			1
users are then asked to answer two security questions , which range from their first car to their favourite job , which were set up when they signed up for the account			1
@entity145 , who admitted hackers had tried to access his account , warned that it was still unclear exactly what happened			2
' we do n't know what happened yet , and in the security world , you need all the facts			2
' he also believed consumers were likely to stay with the firm despite the breaches			0
' historically we do n't see a mass exodus from breaches , consumers do n't seem to change their behaviour			0
' there 's a lot of historical precedent here - and this is just a first strike for @entity0			0
' it does appear that there was a flaw in @entity2 - and we need to hear from @entity0 what the problem was , and what they are going to do to make it better , ’ experts believe the breadth of the celebrities affected could be down to a ‘ chain effect ’ - once one celebrities phonebook was accessed , it could lead to dozens more			2
security consultant @entity191 told @entity77 : ' for these attacks to work , you also need email addresses of target			2
' but what we have seen is that hackers can access address books - and this would have helped the hackers			2
' @entity201 also believes the ' reset password ' system may have been used			1
' it certainly possible that people would have used this , ' he said			0
' in the case of celebrities , these secret questions are very easy to find online - either in @entity210 or by searching through some interviews			1
' @entity212 requires users to respond to an email sent to their address to reset a password @entity191 said that anger was growing at @entity0 among @entity2 users			1
‘ even though we do n’t know exactly what happened , the feeling is growing that @entity0 was n't doing enough to stop this , ' he said			0
however , @entity191 believes customers will stick with @entity0			0
‘ i do n't think we 'll see a mass exodus - people 's memory are very short			0
@entity228 and model @entity229 are among those hit by the leaks so far ' @entity0 is about to announce a new @entity47 , and people will use @entity2 to move their data do it , because it ’s such a simple process			2
the hacker claims he or she broke into stars ' @entity2 accounts , including those of the @entity243 actress , @entity242 and @entity244 , before publishing them on 4chan , the image - sharing forum			0
a list of the alleged victims of the hack - a staggering 101 in total - has also been posted online ; most of whom have not seen any photographs leaked by the hacker			2
@entity191 said he thought ' more leaks are to come '			2
experts also think a flaw in @entity0 's find my phone was used for some of the hacks			2
however , despite not admitting the bug was caused by its system , the tech giant issued a ' patch ' , or fix , for the alleged ' @entity47 ' bug some claim is responsible			2
code on software development site @entity268 called @entity269 , would have allowed malicious users to use ‘ brute force ’ to gain an account ’s password on @entity2 , and in particular its find my @entity47 service			1
@entity0 has since issued a fix for the bug			0
' the end of the fun , @entity0 has just patched , ' read an update on the post			0
the hacker who posted the first batch of pictures said it was the result of ' several months of hard work by all those involved ' brute force , also known as ' brute force cracking ' , is a trial - and - error method used to get plain - text passwords from encrypted data			0
just as a criminal might break into , or ' crack ' a safe by trying many possible combinations , a brute - force cracking attempt goes through all possible combinations of characters in @entity298 a six - letter attack			0
' many users use simple passwords that are the same across services so it 's entirely possible to guess passwords using a tool like this , ' said @entity307 form @entity308			1
and in a statement issued on monday afternoon , the @entity309 confirmed that it had also begun an investigation			0
' the @entity309 is aware of the allegations concerning computer intrusions and the unlawful release of material involving high profile individuals , and is addressing the matter			0
' any further comment would be inappropriate at this time			0
' @entity319 became the first celebrity to publicly criticise @entity0 on monday when she posted a sarcastic message on @entity322			0
the @entity324 star tweeted ' thank you @entity2 ' , the day after naked photos of her were published online .			0
