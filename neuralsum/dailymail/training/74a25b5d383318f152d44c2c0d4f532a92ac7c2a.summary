footage of the teenage troublemaker being thrown off a train by a fed - up fellow traveller on the @entity19 service between @entity20 and @entity21 has become a viral hit after being uploaded to @entity13			1
it begins when a conductor is told the teenager does n't have a ticket and tells the driver of the train to stop until the youngster gets off			1
when the youth refuses a shouting match ensues until a passenger , later referred to as ' the big man ' leaps to his feet and frogmarches him off the train - and keeps pushing him off when he repeatedly tries to re-board the service			1
a two - and - a - half minute video clip - ‘ @entity37 ’ - was posted three days ago and has already been viewed almost 200,000 times			0
but the 19 - year - old student , from @entity40 , has since insisted he was in the right after being tracked down at his home by a local newspaper			1
he said last night : ' i had been out celebrating after an exam and i was half asleep on the train			0
‘ i did have a ticket but i must have handed over the wrong one to the conductor			2
the next thing i know this big guy is manhandling me to the door and throwing me off			2
university student @entity2 , who is studying surveying , added : ‘ i could n’t believe it when the footage turned up on @entity13			1
' he said he still has cuts and bruises over his cheeks ( pictured above ) and legs			0
in the clip , the white - haired @entity19 worker tells the youth : ' i ’ll sit here all night pal			0
i ’m getting paid for this but they ( the passengers ) will start moaning			0
' is there a problem ? after the conductor has been remonstrating with the teenager ( his white beanie hat can just be seen popping over the seats ) , the ' big man ' stands up and approaches the conductor time to move on son : the burly passenger looks down on the teenager and offers the conductor his assistance off and away : the ' big man ' hoists the youth up from his seat and throws him off the train the video continues with the lad protesting his innocence and claiming that he showed the @entity19 employee his ‘ f * * * * * g ticket ’ while a group of stunned young children sit close by with their furious mother			1
but the conductor adds : ' no you have not			0
' the video goes on to show the boy , wearing a beanie hat , produce a single ticket that allows travel in the opposite direction			2
the conductor repeats his previous threat telling the youth : ' no you are off , we will sit here all night			0
why should they pay and not you ? ' scroll down for the video the clip begins by showing the ticket inspector demanding the youngster leaves the train			2
he says he only has a single ticket to travel in the opposite direction			2
the youth responds by swearing back at him it is at this point that a tall , heavyset passenger gets up , approaches the pair and asks ‘ is there a problem here ? ’ before declaring ‘ no problem - right you , off ’			2
he then grabs the lad by the scruff of his neck and bundles him off the train , trying not to clatter into other passengers			0
the teenager tries unsuccessfully a couple of times to barge his way back on before the train doors close			0
as the large man heads back to his seat the carriage erupts into applause and one passenger is clearly heard saying ' @entity139 , big man '			1
while @entity2 himself has defended his actions on the train , the student 's father has called for the man who threw him off to be charged			1
@entity2 was sitting exams today , but salesman @entity148 , 43 , from @entity40 , called for mr @entity149 to face assault charges			1
he said : ' this big guy has basically thrown him head first on to the platform			2
@entity2 's landed on his face , and has a big graze			1
' he 's tried to get back in the carriage to get his bag			2
' he 's diabetic and all his things were in that bag - his medication , his university notes , his money , his mobile phone and his @entity163			2
once at the train doors , the ' big man ' and the ticket collector heave the youngster off the carriage and out you go : the passenger pushes the teenager on to the platform			1
each time he tries to get back in , he pushes him back out again ' but he 's been thrown off again			2
this man has to be charged and have his day in court			0
he had no right to do what he did			0
' if i was him , i 'd expect to be charged			0
' he added : ' some of the comments about @entity2 online have been vile			1
' @entity2 's uncle , who asked not to be named , claimed @entity2 did have a ticket , but it was the wrong one			1
he said @entity2 went to the railway station at @entity183 at 8am to buy a return ticket , but was told two singles would be cheaper as he planned to return off peak			1
he said : ' he was sitting on the train when he noticed both tickets were for @entity183 to @entity189 , but he decided to concentrate on his exam and explain the mix - up to the inspector on the train home			0
' after his exam he went out for a few drinks			0
he got on the train and everyone 's seen the video , but he 's no fare dodger , he was just sold the wrong ticket and the inspector 's decided he 's off at @entity201			1
' the big guy 's got no right to get involved , and @entity2 's face is cut up			1
' the footage is all over @entity13 now and people are viewing it all over the world			0
' he 'd had a drink and swore at the old man , but he 's no ned or fare dodger			1
he paid for a ticket but was sold the wrong one			0
' he 's spoken to police , and told them they can check @entity215 because he bought a ticket			1
but he 's just trying to get on with his exams			0
' a @entity19 spokesman said : ' while we welcome the public ’s support of our zero - tolerance stance on anti-social behaviour , our staff are trained in conflict management and we do not expect members of the public to take matters into their own hands			0
' we are investigating the incident , which appears to show a person travelling without a valid ticket , refusing to pay for the journey , and swearing at a staff member in full view of customers			0
' the ticket inspector waves away any further protests by the teenager			0

teenage ' fare dodger ' @entity2 , 19 , comes forward to defend his behaviour , saying he did have the right ticket and was ' manhandled ' by the ' big man '
