by @entity0 published : 15:37 est , 23 july 2013 updated : 18:26 est , 23 july 2013 the judges boasted that it is the ‘ most diverse ’ list of novels ever nominated for the @entity4			1
but readers would be forgiven for thinking it was the most obscure , after mostly unknown authors made the nominations for the literary prize			2
among those on the longlist for the @entity4 are the works of three first - time authors and an e-book that was initially given away for free in return for mentions on @entity16			1
overlooked : major authors who are off the list include @entity19 , pictured left with an earlier book @entity21 , and @entity22 who won the @entity4 in 1993 with @entity23 the list of 13 books in contention for the £ 50,000 prize represents a departure from last year when @entity29 became the first @entity31 person to win the award for a second time			1
this year ’s longlist is notable for the number of big - name authors who have been overlooked , including @entity38 , @entity22 and @entity19			1
five of the books have yet to be published			1
writer @entity41 , who chaired the judging panel , said : ‘ this is surely the most diverse longlist in @entity4 history : wonderfully various in terms of geography , form , length and subject			1
‘ these 13 outstanding novels range from the traditional to the experimental , from the first century @entity53 to the present day , from 100 pages to 1,000 and from @entity55 to @entity56			1
’ last year 's winner : @entity29 for her novel @entity58			2
pictured here at the ceremony at @entity63 's @entity62 , she has won the prize twice asked if there was a shared theme for the nominees , mr @entity41 said that they mostly seemed to be based on disasters			1
the 1,000 - page work listed is the kills by @entity72 , a political thriller that was first published digitally in four parts , each with a series of short films and audio clips that add to the story			2
the first volume , called @entity81 , was made available free of charge to any reader who sent a message about it on @entity86 or @entity16			0
mr @entity72 , an academic at the @entity89 , said the novel can be ‘ read and enjoyed alone ’ but included suggestions in his book for when readers should access the extra material			0
mr @entity41 said all the judges had seen ‘ the additional content to some extent ’ and would take it into account when drawing up a shortlist but added that it was ‘ by no means an advantage ’ over the other more traditionally - published books			1
he said : ‘ the novel has always adapted and it ’s a very fast - changing form and that ’s one reason why it ’s survived to the present			0
it shifts and changes and this is more shifting and changing than most			0
’ two authors have been nominated before : @entity109 , who 's up this year for @entity110 , and @entity111 for @entity112 only two authors on the list have been nominated for the prize before			2
@entity109 is listed for @entity110 , which is expected to be his final novel , 16 years after he was shortlisted for @entity117			0
@entity111 , who has been shortlisted twice before , is in the running for @entity112 , which came out last year			0
the three first - time authors on the list are @entity121 , who was born in @entity122 a year after independence , @entity124 , whose yet - to - be - released book is set in the @entity127 jewish community in @entity56 , @entity63 , and @entity128 , whose book is told from points of view of 21 people struggling to make a living in rural @entity134			2
the @entity4 , set up in 1969 , is awarded each year to the best full - length @entity136 novel			1
a shortlist of six books will be announced in september with the winner named at a ceremony at the @entity62 in @entity63 on tuesday , october 15			0
the panel of five judges includes @entity143 , presenter of @entity144 on @entity145 and @entity146 on @entity147			0
the bookies have installed @entity149 as the 9/2 favourite , according to @entity151 , but there is a far tighter range of odds quoted than normal			0
@entity155 of @entity151 said : ‘ the longlist this year was one of the hardest of all time to create odds for			0
at this stage we ’re just favouring @entity109 but we do n’t want to write off any contender too hastily			0
‘ the odds suggest the judges will be up long into the night to form the shortlist , let alone arrive at a winner			0
’ a spokesman for bookseller @entity167 said it was ‘ a thrilling list ’			2
he said : ‘ the sheer scope and variety contained in this list mean this should be one of the most unpredictable @entity4 prizes for years			1

@entity175 is notable for big - name authors who have been overlooked
of 13 ' outstanding ' novels in contention , five have yet to be published
if there 's a shared theme , books seem to be ' based on disasters '
@entity167 : one of the most unpredictable @entity4 prizes for years
