@entity1 president @entity0 has strongly supported @entity4 chairman @entity3 ’s campaign for more home grown players in the @entity6			1
@entity3 revealed on monday that he wanted to increase the minimum number of homegrown players in club squads from eight to 12 in order to help the @entity12 team			1
@entity0 , speaking after being elected unopposed for a third term at the @entity14 in @entity15 , is the best possible ally for @entity3 , who is sure to face formidable opposition from the all - powerful @entity6			1
@entity1 president @entity0 agrees with @entity18 's plans to increase number of homegrown players the @entity4 chairman wants to increase the minimum number of home - grown players from eight to 12 @entity3 wants more homegrown players in @entity6 teams , raising the number per squad from eight to 12			1
but only three current squads fall short of that number , though many of their homegrown players have yet to play for the first team			2
@entity34 ( 11 ) : @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45			0
@entity46 ( 9 ) : @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55			0
@entity56 ( 8 ) : @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64			0
@entity0 said : ‘ this is a position we defend			2
we ’re not only talking about @entity12 , we ’re talking all of @entity67			2
mr @entity3 ’s struggle with the @entity4 is something we share and we agree with him			1
with the new leader of the @entity72 ( @entity73 ) , it is important we establish close relations to see how we can protect homegrown , grassroots young players			2
‘ we share the same perspective			0
we will work hand in hand to defend an idea that we think is the right one			0
there is free flow of workers in @entity67 but there are some things that does n’t apply to , like in this case			0
’ @entity1 general secretary @entity87 was also enthusiastic about @entity3 ’s mission			1
he said : ‘ it ’s fantastic			0
eight out of 25 ( the number of home - grown players that currently must be included in a @entity94 squad ) is not as many as it should be			1
so whatever move in favour of increasing homegrown players is something we can only support			2
’ @entity3 ’s proposals have irritated the @entity6 who never like being dictated to by the @entity4			1
@entity3 said on tuesday : ‘ we ’re open to discussions and i ’d like to persuade some of the clubs this is an issue			1
’ @entity3 's plans also include ' home - grown ' players having to train in @entity12 for three years before the age of 18 @entity110 director @entity109 said the proposals needed ' to be discussed by all the stakeholders ' it could make for some tension between @entity3 and the @entity6 at the club summit tomorrow , especially as the @entity117 representatives on the @entity118 had advised @entity3 ( left ) last week not to go public			1
@entity110 director @entity109 sits on the @entity119 and will join the @entity120 in may after his election on tuesday as the @entity123 vice-president			0
@entity124 , who is also a @entity6 representative on the @entity4 board , said : ‘ it ’s a relevant thing to look at , but it needs to be discussed by all the stakeholders			1
’ @entity128 said he would love more homegrown players to get opportunities but admitted it is difficult @entity128 said that the system does n't always work in favour of players like it has for @entity51 of late @entity110 and @entity12 midfielder @entity128 said : ‘ we ’d all love more homegrown , @entity123 players to get opportunities			1
there are two sides to the argument : you ’ve got to be good enough to get the chance in the first place but someone ’s got to give you that chance			0
‘ someone like @entity51 is the perfect example of how we ’d all like it to be			0
he gets his chance and takes it and has elevated himself to another level			0
‘ but it does n’t always work like that			0
plenty of times you look at young lads and think , he ’s got a chance but it does n’t quite work			0
’ @entity12 team - mate @entity36 said : ‘ i agree with some aspects			1
i think it ’s important to have a mixture			0
i love to see young players getting opportunities			2
but i ’m respectful of the fact that the @entity6 is one of the best leagues in the world and it attracts some of the top players			1
‘ fans want to see exciting players and top clubs want top players and sometimes they are overseas			2
it is a matter of getting that balance			0
’ @entity36 wants more young players to get opportunities but respected the @entity6 's position @entity36 hopes a balance can be reached between the quality of the league and young players coming through @entity180 , the @entity181 chairman and an @entity183 member , said : ‘ any foreign player who comes to this country we welcome			1
but we also have a duty of care to our national game and to young homegrown players			2
‘ everything we are working towards on the @entity183 is with the aim of making our national side more competitive at elite level			0

@entity4 chairman proposed raising the minimum number of home - grown players from eight to 12 at @entity6 clubs
@entity3 's plans also include ' home - grown ' players having to train in @entity12 for three years before the age of 18 rather than *21*
@entity1 president @entity0 is in favour of the rule changes
@entity0 could be a powerful ally with the @entity6 unlikely to be keen
