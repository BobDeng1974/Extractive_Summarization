letting go by @entity0 how intriguing it is to see how often women talk about their lives in terms of physical exertion			1
we juggle , we multi-task , we lean in			2
@entity0 writes vividly about her battle with healthy eating ( picture posed by model ) i once had a riding teacher whose motto , in life as in showjumping , was @entity17 ! @entity0 , journalist and television presenter of @entity20 ’s supersize vs @entity21 , suspects that all this strenuous effort is getting us nowhere			1
a perfectionist , whose struggle to overcome anorexia is described in her memoir , an @entity23 , she noticed that even after her recovery , her efforts to keep rigid control over every aspect of her life were holding her back			1
@entity0 ’s story begins in a @entity37 manor house , where five women and a lone businessman had gathered for a nine - day course of self - improvement			1
the programme offered vegetarian food , yoga , meditation , life coaching and twice - daily sessions of neurofeedback , a form of brain training that uses ‘ low - resolution electromagnetic tomography to work deep areas of the brain ’			0
to her surprise , @entity0 embraced it all with enthusiasm , though she had terrible trouble with the trauma release session , where the participants were supposed to rid themselves of deeply ingrained trauma by lying on the floor and shaking all over			2
@entity0 could n’t muster so much as a twitch			2
but she nevertheless ‘ came back to @entity64 feeling as if she could take on the world			0
six months later , the transformation was striking enough to inspire her to examine the benefits of letting go in more detail			0
she begins with body image			0
‘ we all have body hang - ups , ’ she argues — a magazine survey found 97 per cent of respondents admitted to having severe negative thoughts about their body every day			0
she writes vividly about her continuing battle to eat not just healthily , but with pleasure			1
and there is a bleakly comic account of going on the road for @entity19 vs @entity21 with the director , @entity83 , and assistant producer , @entity84			1
@entity83 , who once weighed 19 st , had recently lost 7 st , and survived on raw broccoli drenched in vinegar and small bags of cashew nuts , while @entity84 ate large quantities of salmon and sprinkled chilli flakes on everything			0
what with @entity0 ’s diet of multi-seed bread , banana and @entity99 yoghurt , it does n’t sound like an enjoyable version of healthy eating , but as always , she sees the positives			1
‘ we were healthy , happy , not over-weight nor under - weight , managing to live perfectly well , despite our weird tastes			0
’ a potpourri of ideas and observations from everyone from the @entity110 to @entity111 , @entity0 ’s kindness and enthusiasm for helping those who have suffered , like her , from a crippling lack of confidence is beguiling			2
as she says : ‘ we all heal each other			0
