how many times have you plated up a serving of food , only to realise that your eyes were too big for your stomach ? in most cases we leave the leftovers to the side of our plate and throw the food away without a second thought			0
but a new app could be about to put an end to that			0
@entity16 is being developed to help cut down on waste by offering those ' tasty ' , unwanted morsels to those who might appreciate what you are happy to bin			1
will leftovers save the planet ? the new app , @entity16 , hopes to cut down on global waste and ensure people do n't go without food the basic premise of the app is that you can advertise your unwanted food by photographing and uploading images of it			1
hungry app owners in the local vicinity can then get in touch , order their ‘ takeaway ’ and eat the otherwise redundant food – saving them money and , the developers hope , the planet			1
the creators also believe the concept will help reconnect communities as they get in touch and share meals			0
the website says that the app is for people ‘ who hate the idea of throwing out food , but also do n't want to be eating the same leftovers for the next few days			1
’ @entity16 ( mockup of app pictured ) could help you get rid of that overindulgent takeaway it says : ‘ @entity60 do n't feel the need to eat an enormous restaurant portion , and instead pass it on to a hungrier neighbour , in turn learning their name and avoiding excess calories			1
‘ through increasing the efficiency of each plot of land dedicated to food production , we can reduce our intensive use of natural resources , and reduce our expansion into sensitive environmental areas			2
the site points out that research has shown that 40 per cent of the food we produce goes to waste			2
however , there are suspicions that the app is a hoax			2
the app ’s website features a ridiculous graph predicting that as more people use the app and reduce their food waste , there will be a rise in the @entity92 population but developers are adamant the concept is genuine			1
@entity96 entrepreneur @entity95 says he and his friend @entity97 conceived the idea for @entity16 several years ago , when they ordered too much pizza and could n’t fit the remaining portions in the fridge , according to a report by @entity104			0
good sense of humour or hint of a hoax ? some believe the new app is a prank but the developers maintain they are very serious about the concept they said that at first it was just a joke but that over the past three years the concept seems to have made increasing sense			1
' we were like , " we do n’t want to throw this out , and it would just be great to broadcast that we have extra pizza to share " , ' he recalls			0
the idea really started to take shape after mr @entity95 hosted a ' couch surfer ' in his apartment who lived as a ' freegan ' - meaning he only ate from other people ’s plates , or from the bins			0
' that was enough to spark initiative in me , ' @entity95 said			0
it is not clear when the app will be launched			0
the website says : ' we 're currently building out @entity16 and are aiming to release it for the @entity138 as soon as possible with an @entity140 version coming after			2

@entity16 is being developed by two *university* friends who claim the app will help reduce food waste and help connect people
users can upload a picture of their unwanted morsels and hungry people can order the food as a ' takeaway ' and get it delivered to them
some say it is a hoax but developers say they are serious about concept
not clear when will be available but app *'s* website says launch is *imminent*
