when @entity1 toddler @entity0 slipped in a pool and suffered severe brain damage doctors were unable to save her , or provide a humane way to end her suffering			1
with no way to revive @entity0 , known as @entity8 to her family , all the hospital was able to do was to withhold nutrition			1
the family of the 21 - month - old girl had to watch helplessly as she starved to death over nine days , and they are now campaigning to make euthanasia legal in the state			2
painful loss : @entity0 , known as @entity8 , was left with a brain injury after falling in a pool traumatic : when doctors could n't save @entity8 her feeding tube was removed to allow her to die @entity8 was 19 months old when she stumbled into a pool at the family home last year , and suffered an anoxic brain injury			1
the hospital that treated her tried an experimental treatment to revive the little girl , but although she survived the procedure she was left blind , deaf , paralyzed and suffering from seizures			1
she managed to recover from some of the symptoms over the next month , but she was given only a 4 per cent chance of surviving the year			0
with her suffering more seizures , organ failure and other complications , the hospital 's @entity34 ruled that @entity39 was the most humane course for @entity8			0
however , the only way that can be carried out in @entity1 is by removing life support or , as the @entity0 family said : ' essentially , if we wanted to put a stop to her suffering , we would had to starve her to death			1
' devastating : @entity8 's mother and family are mourning the loss of their beautiful baby heartbreaking : the happy and healthy little girl wasted away before her family 's eyes the ethics committee at @entity57 recommended @entity39 was the best option for @entity8 ' i had no idea , no idea , what my family was about to endure , ' @entity8 's grandfather , @entity59 , told @entity64 7			2
' it was just horrible			0
blind and deaf and ca n't move			1
' in @entity1 euthanasia is illegal but the @entity0 family believe those in a similar situation to what they faced should be given some choice			1
mr @entity59 told @entity74 the nine days of suffering @entity8 endured could have been replaced with 30 seconds of a medically - induced , less painful death			0
' it should be right to choose to let them go quickly and peacefully , ' he said			0
the family were so traumatized by watching their beautiful little girl wither away over nine agonizing days , that they are campaigning to make what is already a heartbreaking situation more dignified for others			2
' we euthanize dogs for humanity reasons , we euthanize serial killers but , a 21 - month old baby has to starve for almost nine days , ' mr @entity59 said			2
campaign : a foundation has been set up in @entity0 's name to campaign for euthanasia laws to change call for change : @entity96 is campaigning to change the law in @entity1 after watching his granddaughter 's painfully slow death the family are raising awareness for the campaign for dignity in @entity104 , which proposes legalizing assisted dying in certain cases			1
on the family 's the @entity108 website they blamed the current ' barbaric law ' for ' forcing tens of thousands of @entity111 every single year to choose between insufferable agony or the undignified sadness of starvation '			0
the process of ending a terminally ill patient 's life by removing their feeding tube is said to be humane , but the @entity120 said it was a harrowing experience			1
@entity8 lost half her body weight and became increasingly delirious			0
she became ' nothing but a shell of the little girl , that a few short months ago , filled our lives with laughter and happiness , ' her family said			0
but neurologist @entity131 , who works with terminal patients , said legalizing euthanasia could be a slippery slope			0
' when do you decide that this is the right time to hasten their death ? ... i think you do better to allow that process to go on naturally and make people comfortable in the process , ' she said .			0

@entity0 was left blind , deaf and paralyzed from severe brain injury
end of @entity146 was recommended when doctors could n't save her
in @entity1 , that meant removing a feeding tube and *waiting* for girl to starve
