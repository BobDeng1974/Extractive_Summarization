next week ’s @entity1 congress in @entity2 looks increasingly problematic for president @entity3 with the decision to award the 2018 @entity5 to @entity6 now under attack as well as the @entity9 fiasco			0
a global campaign calling for a boycott of @entity5 sponsors @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 is being led by @entity16 with @entity17 , a human rights organisation based in @entity19 opposing @entity6 ’s annexation of the @entity22 peninsula			0
a spokesman for @entity24 said : ‘ we have this opportunity standing right in front of us to have @entity1 strip @entity6 of its @entity5			0
i do not believe the sponsors want to align their brands with @entity30			0
’ problems ahead : @entity3 could face a problematic time at a conference in @entity2 the anti-russia protest is extremely well funded , as it is financed by @entity34 , the holding company for the fabulously rich @entity36 financier @entity35			0
meanwhile , the @entity9 controversy became yet more toxic with an @entity39 tv website claiming that @entity36 ’s spy agency , the @entity41 , and its @entity43 counterpart , @entity44 , were allegedly involved in the leak of @entity1 emails and investigative reports to further destabilise the @entity49 hosts			0
@entity50 , who accuses the media of having an obsession with @entity53 , can use his meet - the - fans experience in @entity55 to back that up			1
despite @entity53 ’s position in the @entity61 team being a matter of much debate , supporters quizzing @entity50 in @entity58 did n’t ask one question about @entity53			1
one fan said afterwards that @entity61 followers were n’t that bothered about @entity53 as his last good international tournament for @entity61 was in 2004			1
question time : @entity50 meets the @entity61 fans in @entity55 obsessions : @entity50 says the @entity72 media focus too much on @entity53 former @entity76 chief executive @entity75 , on holiday in @entity74 , has been around the @entity61 hotel and watched the squad training on the @entity80 campus with the invited fans who included @entity83 dealers and @entity85 patrons			1
@entity75 , who has never been known to refuse a tv or radio interview , will not be able to resist pontificating on @entity61 if asked			1
and more good news is that talkative @entity89 is looking for another top admin job in football			0
the sponsorship perimeter boards around the @entity80 training ground had a ‘ @entity61 ’ message in place of a @entity97 promotion because of gambling advertising regulations in the @entity36			2
but it highlighted once again the @entity101 ’s double standards in having a high - profile betting partner when everyone involved in the sport is forbidden to gamble on football worldwide			0
touching down : @entity106 arrives in @entity55 @entity106 needs @entity107 @entity106 , who arrived in @entity55 on friday night , is planning soon to list the key backers of his group ’s proposal for a new waterside stadium for their @entity113 franchise next door to the @entity116 basketball arena			1
and the major speculation in @entity55 is whether @entity106 ’s official cheerleaders will include @entity116 superstar @entity107 , whose late attack of cramp led to defeat by the @entity122 in the opening game of the @entity125 finals			1
@entity107 , @entity106 ’s close friend , has long been linked with joining his ownership group			1
and certainly @entity107 ’s patronage would greatly help reverse the negative publicity around the stadium in a celebrity - obsessed city			2
@entity106 , sure to be courtside for game three of the @entity125 finals in @entity55 next week , said : ‘ if @entity107 comes in that will be amazing because people love him in this city			1
he ’s not just a great sportsman but a great man			0
’ @entity138 consider the @entity5 important enough to send an army of 272 personnel to @entity141 — even including a specialist @entity143 operative , who could more efficiently operate from @entity145			0
and @entity146 broadcast this week to 571,000 viewers a ludicrous programme — updated from 2010 — listing @entity61 ’s worst ever players , one of whom , @entity150 , represented @entity151			2
a @entity153 spokeswoman said it was a light - hearted show and the social media chief had a crucial integrating output role to play in @entity141			2
@entity157 hearted : former @entity151 international @entity150 was included in @entity61 's @entity159 show on @entity146			2

@entity53 not on the agenda at @entity61 fans ' *q&a* with @entity50
former @entity76 chief @entity75 watches @entity61 train while on holiday in @entity74
@entity106 needs help from basketball star @entity107 for @entity113 franchise
