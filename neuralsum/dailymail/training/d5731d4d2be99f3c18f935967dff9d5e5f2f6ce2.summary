the @entity0 will spent an estimated $ 1.15 billion this year caring for minors in its @entity4 program , and @entity6 @entity5 said tuesday that they want to add an additional $ 1 billion for 2015			1
the program , part of the agency 's @entity9 , is responsible for the health and welfare of children who cross the @entity15 border illegally and arrive without parents			2
an unprecedented flood of such children has arrived in recent weeks , with leaked photos showing overcrowded holding facilities run by the @entity22 division of the @entity23			1
underage illegal immigrants traveling without family members are held in those makeshift detention centers , three - quarters of which are on military bases , for a maximum of 72 hours while they are processed into the @entity15 immigration system and given court dates			1
flood : children have raced across the @entity15 border since president @entity35 's 2012 speech announcing that he had relaxed deportation standards for children who were already in the country @entity0 says the number of ' unaccompanied alien children ' it will serve in 2014 is more than double what it took in last year , but most sober estimates put the number far higher -- at least at 80,000 after that , @entity0 takes over , with a dedicated budget for this year of $ 868 million , according to its most recent budget			1
a @entity6 @entity50 aide told @entity51 on tuesday that additional discretionary funds brought the planned total for 2014 to $ 911.9 million			2
but @entity0 's budget , prepared last year , anticipates caring for 60,000 children , not the 80,000 who more recent estimates expect to pour across the border – mostly from @entity60 countries			1
adjusting for that difference , the agency will have to shift additional discretionary dollars into the @entity3 program , bringing the total to at least $ 1.2 billion			1
at least one estimate , appearing in the @entity66 , projects a total of 120,000 for fiscal year 2014			2
in 2011 @entity0 took custody of 6,775 such children			1
the number was 13,625 in 2012 and 24,668 in 2013			0
despite widespread forecasts of another massive increase past the 60,000 expected for the current fiscal year , which ends on september 30 , an @entity0 spokesperson told @entity51 on tuesday afternoon that the agency 's internal expectations have n't changed			1
' we are still using @entity79 , ' he wrote in an email			0
the spokesperson also referred questions about @entity0 's budget to the @entity83 inside the @entity84 ; that agency did not respond to emails seeking comment			1
@entity5 , led by @entity89 sen. @entity88 and @entity91 sen. @entity90 , announced tuesday that they aim to put an additional $ 1 billion in play for 2015 , bringing the program 's planned total to $ 1.94 billion			1
that number would correspond to an expectation of more than 200,000 illegal alien children arriving next year			1
' this is an emergency situation by any definition , ' said @entity90 , who chairs the @entity100 , on tuesday			0
she also referred to the tens of thousands of children swarming into the @entity15 as ' an urgent humanitarian crisis			0
' not just adults : @entity105 agents are apprehending hundreds of illegal immigrant children every day , and the @entity0 is responsible for taking care of them until a suitable adult family member can claim them unlike previous waves of illegal immigrants , hardly any of the children pouring across @entity60 's southern border are from @entity114 ; most of the flood is coming from @entity60 @entity90 added that her committee foresees that the problem will get worse , providing ' expanded transfer authority to respond to sudden or urgent needs in the future ... to increase shelter capacity and provide critical support services for children in @entity0 care			1
' the appropriations committee will take up @entity90 's funding bill on thursday			0
@entity88 lined up in favor of the added spending on tuesday , saying in a statement that ' the recent influx of tens of thousands of children entering the country without their parents has resulted in emergency situations in border states			2
' ' @entity138 , state and local officials need increased resources to properly shelter , feed and clothe these children as they work to find solutions to these heartbreaking situations			2
' in 2013 , @entity0 budgeted just $ 376 billion to deal with the problem			1
but that fiscal year began just months after president @entity35 announced a major immigration law exemption for children who were brought into the @entity15 illegally before june 2007			2
children in @entity60 , and their parents , got a garbled message , believing that they could take advantage of a policy shift and enter the @entity15 with impunity			0
those who make it to the @entity15 and are captured by border patrol officers get classroom education , mental health and medical services , recreation and other taxpayer - funded services			2
the @entity163 is paying for their attorneys			0
@entity100 chair sen. @entity90 , a @entity91 @entity166 , is putting an extra $ 1 billion into @entity0 's budget to care for illegal immigrant children in 2015 @entity170 sen. @entity169 slammed president @entity35 on tuesday for the influx of young illegals : ' these children are being preyed on by drug cartels and human traffickers , and they ¿ re at high risk of being kidnapped , raped , or even killed ' “ the average length of stay in the program is currently near 35 days , ' @entity0 says in published information sheets			1
' of the children served , some 85 % are reunified with their families			0
' it 's unclear how many of those family members are in the @entity15 legally			0
' the majority of the youth are cared for through a network of state - licensed @entity9 - funded care providers			0
' in a @entity6 floor speech tuesday , @entity170 @entity189 @entity169 blamed the @entity84 for creating the problem			0
' sadly , this crisis is directly the result of president @entity35 's own policies and it involves tens of thousands of young children , ' he said			0
' these children are being preyed on by drug cartels and human traffickers , and they ’re at high risk of being kidnapped , raped , or even killed while traveling in this long dangerous journey to the @entity15			0
' ' but sadly , when they arrive here , we still have no way of guaranteeing their safety because of lack of an adequate plan to deal with this humanitarian crisis			0
' @entity169 also slammed the @entity84 for sending mixed signals to countless @entity211 families , saying that by changing immigration policy unilaterally , ' the president has created an extremely dangerous incentive for children and their parents to cross into the @entity15			0

the @entity0 has a $ *912* million budget in @entity219 to care for ' @entity221 ' but *underestimated* how many minors would flood across the border
the funding will likely be *upgraded* to $ 1.15 billion this year
@entity5 propose to add another $ 1 billion to the budget for next year , a number corresponding to 200,000 children arriving in 2015
@entity22 turns the children over to @entity0 after 72 hours of ' processing '
@entity0 spends taxpayer dollars on medical care , food , shelter and ' *entertainment* '
