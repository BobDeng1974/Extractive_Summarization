by @entity0 published : 11:34 est , 29 january 2013 updated : 13:00 est , 29 january 2013 five years after a gunman forced five women into the back of a @entity6 clothing store and shot them dead execution - style , police are still searching for answers			1
authorities have received 6,700 tips about the 2008 killings at the @entity13 store in @entity14 , but they are no closer to knowing who took the women 's lives - or why			1
store manager @entity18 , 42 , @entity19 , 34 , @entity20 , 33 , @entity21 , 22 , and @entity22 , 37 , died in the grisly shootings on february 2 , 2008			1
shortly after 10 a.m. , a man posing as a delivery man walked into the store and chatted with two customers and two employees			2
he then pulled out a gun and announced a holdup			0
victims : store manager @entity18 , 42 , ( left ) and shopper @entity20 , 33 , ( right ) were among the five women shot dead by a gunman in a @entity13 store in the @entity6 area in 2008 he forced the four women into the back room of the store , bound them with duct tape and forced them face down on the floor , police said			1
two more women who later entered the store were also taken into the back room , tied and forced next to the others			1
when the gunman was distracted , store manager @entity18 managed to call 911 from her cell phone even though she was bound by duct tape			1
dispatchers logged the call at 10.44 a.m. and heard her frantically describing what was happening			0
on the call , the man could also be heard saying : ' i 'm losing it			0
' loss : @entity57 , 34 , ( left ) and @entity21 , 22 , ( right ) were also marched into the back room of the store and shot execution style by the gunman who has never been caught missed : mother - of - two @entity22 , 37 , died as she shopped for an outfit for a girls ' night out he then shot the six women execution style , fatally shooting five			1
the sixth victim pretended to be dead until police arrived a few minutes later			1
by the time authorities arrived on the scene , the man had fled			2
he left bullet casings from a .40 - caliber @entity74 behind , but took the gun with him			2
the one survivor was able to describe him in detail as he had not been wearing a mask			0
she said he was a 6 foot @entity80 man with braided hair and cornrows , and aged between 25 and 35			0
she noted that his hair was pulled back but that one braid hung by his right cheek with light - green beads on the end of it			2
the woman did not recognise the man and investigators did not find a connection between him and any of the other victims			2
wanted : a sixth victim survived the shooting by pretending to be dead and described the gunman to police			1
investigators created this image to show their suspect , but he has not been found authorities believe the killings could have been motivated by robbery as he took a few hundred dollars from the store , but they have not been able to confirm this			1
today , three investigators work on the case full time and tips keep coming in - although they are becoming less frequent			1
in 2008 , there were 5,600 calls while there were just 87 last year			2
investigators have followed leads as far afield as @entity117 , @entity118 and @entity119 , but nothing has helped solve the crime , and there were no security cameras in the store to assist police			1
with specialist training courses and help from agencies including @entity129 , the police department in @entity14 has spent nearly $ 2 million trying to find the killer			1
' there is somebody out there who knows who did this , ' cmdr			0
scene : police stand watch outside a @entity13 store where the shooting occurred in @entity14 , @entity145 search : investigators have received thousands of tips yet the grisly crime has not been solved tragic : officials remove the remains of a victim in @entity14 after the five women were shot dead ' maybe their conscience is bothering them			1
maybe they will get themselves in a jam and need to help themselves out			0
i do n't care what their motivation is			0
we need them to come forward			0
' but not all family members are seeking such closure			0
@entity19 's sister @entity167 said she fears the pain that would follow an arrest			0
' we would all have to go through all that again , ' she said			0
' sometimes , i would like to just imagine that he 's dead somewhere			2
' on saturday , family members will gather outside the store , which has been empty since the murders , to remember their loved ones			0
store manager @entity18 was scheduled to be off on the day of the killings , but had stopped by the shop to help with markdowns			2
pain : @entity181 reacts after putting up five crosses in front of the store the day after the murder site : the shop , at @entity188 , is now being renovated for new tenants @entity19 , 34 , was enjoying a weekend away from home with her husband when she nipped into the shop , which specialised in clothes for plus - size women , and unsuspectingly became a victim			1
@entity20 , 33 , was shopping for an outfit for a get - together with old college friends , while mother - of - two @entity22 , 37 , was looking for new clothes for a girls ' night out that evening			0
@entity21 , 22 , visited the shop to buy some winter work clothes for her new job in the accounting department at @entity204 in downtown @entity6			0
