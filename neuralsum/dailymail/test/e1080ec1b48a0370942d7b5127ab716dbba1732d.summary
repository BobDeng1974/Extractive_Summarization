@entity1 hero @entity0 was lost for words as he tried to describe the emotion of scoring his stunning winner against @entity5 admitting he even had to question that it was even happening			1
the @entity8 hitman smashed home a missile of a left - footed volley in sunday 's 1 - 0 win at the @entity13 to ease the @entity8 three points clear of the @entity16 relegation zone and send @entity17 into ecstasy			1
it was just the club 's third home league win of the season , but a fifth successive victory over the @entity23 , and january signing @entity0 will have good reason to remember it long after he has finally hung up his boots			2
@entity0 ( centre ) connects beautifully with a left - footed volley to fire @entity8 into a 1 - 0 lead @entity5 goalkeeper @entity30 was unable to do anything about @entity0 's 45th - minute strike the 32 - year - old said : ' it just happened so quickly , but as soon as it left my foot , i knew			1
it 's one of those moments when you think , " wow ! is this even happening ? "			0
the stadium just erupted and i got emotional , it was crazy			0
' the feeling , it 's hard to even find words to describe that sort of feeling			1
' it 's up there , to be honest - and with my weaker foot , it 's definitely up there , top five easily easily			2
' it 's definitely up there - top two , actually			2
the feeling , why i got emotional , that feeling was unbelievable			2
' ' i remember a long ball , and @entity59 was unbelievable because he played the number nine role up there on his own and me and @entity62 ( @entity63 ) were just beside him			0
the 32 - year - old watches on as the strike - his third for @entity8 - flies over @entity30 in the @entity23 goal the striker wheels away in celebration of his brilliant strike just before the half - time whistle was blown ' even from when i was young and you do finishing , i have always practised on my left foot because in games , sometimes you get chances and sometimes it comes on your left foot , so i have always practised over the years from when i was very young so i feel comfortable that when a chance comes , i can not even think about it , i can just hit it like i did			1
' but to score a goal like that in a game like this , it 's a dream come true			0
' @entity8 might have increased their lead as the game opened up with the visitors launching a desperate late attempt to salvage a point , but in the end , a single goal was enough to leave @entity0 marvelling at his first experience of the @entity96 rivalry			1
he said : the lads said , ' just wait ' , but wow ! even in the warm - up , the noise , and coming down the tunnel , i had goosebumps			2
@entity0 seemed overcome with emotion as he fell to the turf shortly after putting @entity8 into a 1 - 0 lead the 32 - year - old frontman looked close to tears as both teams left the @entity13 pitch at half - time ' but even travelling to the stadium and seeing all the fans in the streets , seeing all the kids with their shirts on , it was just crazy			1
' the victory ended a seven - game wait for a three - point haul , and it could hardly have been better timed after new head coach @entity118 took over the reins and left his players in no doubt about the fact that they faced nine cup finals			0
that process will continue next weekend when @entity128 's @entity127 head for the @entity129 , of course , was @entity5 boss for the first four of those five defeats - and @entity0 is hoping he and his team - mates can use their derby success as a springboard			1
he said : ' you win a game like this and the lads have got to enjoy it			0
everyone will enjoy it , the fans			0
' but at the end of the day , the season has n't finished and we have massive games coming up			0
it 's important that we just concentrate on the next game , be professional and win that			0
