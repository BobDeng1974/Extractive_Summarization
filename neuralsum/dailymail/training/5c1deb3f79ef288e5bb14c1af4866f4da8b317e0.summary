by @entity0 published : 12:23 est , 13 november 2013 @entity2 : 12:29 est , 13 november 2013 cutting edge 3d printing technology is being used to recreate the severely injured face of a road accident victim			0
a team of @entity8 surgeons are poised to carry out a pioneering operation , which will restore the symmetry of a man ’s face , using new parts produced by a printer			1
the unaffected side of the biker ’s face has been used to create a mirror image , which will enable perfect facial reconstruction			1
a computer image of ' scaffolding ' for a human ear			0
the model was created by @entity24 in @entity25 , but a similar one will be used to create the @entity26 printed part of the unknown man 's face computer images are being used to create titanium implants using @entity26 , which commonly known as 3d printing			1
the images are used both to design guides to cut and position facial bones with pinpoint accuracy and create tailor - made implants for the patient			1
the guides and implants are being produced in medical - grade titanium in @entity41 , at one of the world ’s few specialist 3d printing facilities			1
surgeons in @entity46 , south @entity47 , used an x-ray ct scan to create minutely detailed three - dimensional images to design the bespoke implants			1
the futuristic work is led by consultant maxillofacial surgeon @entity52 , at @entity53 , @entity46 , run by @entity54			1
a scaffolding nose is pictured , which could help patients who needs reconstructive surgery			0
it relies upon using the patient 's own cells so that the body is less likley to reject a new osy part			0
unlike the nose pictured , the guides and implants used in the upcoming operation are being produced in medical - grade titanium the unaffected side of the biker ’s face has been used to create a mirror image			1
surgeons in @entity46 used an x-ray ct scan to create minutely detailed three - dimensional images			2
these images are used both to design guides to cut and position facial bones and create tailor - made implants for the patient			1
the guides and implants are being produced in medical - grade titanium in @entity41			2
the work is considered so groundbreaking and radical it already features in an exhibition at @entity85 ’s @entity84 , even before the operation itself has been carried out			0
@entity88 , a reconstructive scientist and @entity90 manager , said : ' the patient suffered trauma and had multiple injuries across his body , including some quite severe facial injuries			2
' he underwent emergency surgery at the time and we are now at the stage where we can do a proper reconstruction of his face			2
' the project is the work of the @entity105 in @entity106 ( @entity107 ) , established in 2006 as a partnership between @entity53 ’s @entity109 and @entity110 ( @entity110 ) based at @entity111			1
@entity107 aims to make @entity47 a world leader in the research , development and application of advanced medical technologies in surgery			2
mr @entity52 and mr @entity88 worked with @entity110 ’s @entity118 and @entity119 to virtually plan the complex surgery , which will involve repositioning the patient ’s facial bones			1
here , a finished ear , which consists of a coiled antenna inside a cartilage structure , is pictured			0
two wires lead from the base of the ear and wind around a helical ' cochlea ' - the part of the ear that senses sound - which can connect to electrod			0
it is just one example of a @entity26 printed organ mr @entity88 added : ' we have done everything up to the point of surgery			0
the concept of the operation has been virtually designed and we hope to do the work very soon			0
' the patient ’s facial symmetry will be restored so he should be back to normal as far as his facial looks are concerned			1
' discussions are now taking place to plan when the surgery itself will take place			2
the identity of the patient concerned has not been revealed			0
referring to the @entity85 exhibition , mr @entity88 said : ' the exhibition is all about cutting - edge activities in this area of work so to have this case appear there is amazing			0
' called @entity26 : printing @entity162 , the exhibition continues at the @entity84 until july 1 next year .			0

unaffected side of the biker ’s face has been used to make a mirror image
@entity52 , at @entity53 , @entity46 is leading the project that uses @entity170 to create titanium implants
the surgery is planned to take place soon so that the patient ’s facial symmetry will be restored
