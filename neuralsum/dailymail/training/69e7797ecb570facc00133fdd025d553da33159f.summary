@entity10 , of @entity11 , @entity12 , got the @entity4 logo and ' @entity14 ' inked on his arm months ago			1
he may be foolishly optimistic , he could even be a jinx , but you have to admire his faith			0
@entity19 are now just two games from a first @entity8 win and face the @entity22 in the @entity24 match on sunday			1
and @entity10 will be watching more closely than most			2
counting his chickens ? one @entity4 fan was celebrating his team 's @entity8 win - before the season even started faith : ' i 'm not crazy , i 'm not crazy at all			1
i 'm confident , ' @entity10 said ' i 'm not crazy , i 'm not crazy at all			1
i 'm confident , i 'm 100 percent confident in every single player on that team , ' @entity10 told @entity32			1
the @entity4 take on the 49ers in an exciting match - up on sunday night , and if they get through that play - off game either @entity35 or @entity37 await in the @entity8 on february 2			1
if @entity19 fail , @entity10 will have to find a way of adapting his tattoo or endure a permanent reminder of a painful defeat			2
unfortunately for this superfan that wo n't be simple to do			0
@entity44 ca n't just tweak the tattoo if the @entity4 win next year as the 2015 game will be @entity8 49 - @entity47 in roman numerals			2
two games away : @entity4 running back @entity50 , top , scores past @entity53 in the @entity24 divisional playoff game			2
@entity19 face @entity55 in the @entity24 on sunday and from 2016 and @entity8 50 , all the @entity24 games will start with the @entity57 but , for now at least , @entity10 has no concerns about his tattoo remaining accurate			1
he told @entity60 that he has ' no tiny little bit of doubt at all ' that the @entity4 will bring the @entity63 home from the @entity65 in @entity66			0
@entity44 ' tattoo artist was worried at first , but has no come round to his client 's optimistic way of thinking			0
@entity70 of @entity71 in @entity11 , told @entity60 : ' i said , " hey man , people are going to attack you â € ¦ that you 're the jinx of the team			0
" ' unfortunately your browser does not support @entity78			0
jinx ? @entity10 ' tattoo artist , @entity70 , was worried at first , but has no come round to his client 's optimistic way of thinking but he said that @entity10 ended up convincing him otherwise			0
@entity70 explained : ' he 's right , you know what , you think like that , you 're not a real fan			0
' @entity10 said that 95 percent of @entity19 fans approve of his ink			2
he tells the remaining doubters that he is a true fan that believes in his team .			0

@entity10 got the @entity4 logo and ' @entity14 ' tattooed on his arm months ago
@entity19 still have to beat the @entity22 in a play - off on sunday
