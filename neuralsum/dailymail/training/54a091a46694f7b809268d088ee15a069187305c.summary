by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 06:26 est , 17 september 2013 updated : 07:02 est , 17 september 2013 the huge divide in @entity4 ’s house price boom was revealed today , with only @entity5 leaving the regions far behind			1
the capital saw rises of almost 10 per cent in july , but prices fell in @entity10 , @entity11 and the north of @entity13			1
to add to the pain , house prices are rising faster for first - time buyers than for those who already own a home			1
ministers played down talk of a new ‘ housing bubble ’ as experts warned the recovery was far below historic trends			2
average house prices rose by almost 10 per cent in @entity5 in the year to july , but fell in @entity11 , @entity10 and northern @entity13 struggle : house prices for first - time buyers are rising faster than those who already own a home the latest @entity29 showed values in @entity13 have now exceeded the peak in january 2008			1
but it is almost entirely fuelled by a sharp rise in prices in @entity5 and the @entity35			1
the @entity36 said that @entity4 house prices in july were 3.3 per cent higher than in 2012 , up from a 3.1 per cent rise in june			1
but when @entity5 and the @entity35 are removed , prices are only up 0.8 per cent			1
last week , the @entity40 ( @entity40 ) suggested that a 5 per cent cap should be placed on annual house price growth to stop any future house price bubble and borrowers taking on too much debt for fear of missing out on a boom			2
‘ @entity29 price growth remains stable across most of the @entity4 , although prices in @entity5 are increasing faster than the @entity4 average , ’ the @entity36 said			1
‘ the year - on - year increase reflected growth of 3.7 per cent in @entity13 and 1.8 per cent in @entity53 , offset by falls of 2 per cent in @entity10 and 0.7 per cent in @entity11			2
’ in july prices paid by first - time buyers were 4 per cent higher than a year earlier			1
by comparison for existing owners prices were only 3 per cent up			1
chancellor @entity60 has announced plans for the government to guarantee 95 per cent mortgages under the help to buy scheme			0
but business secretary @entity66 has warned the plans risk fuelling a new housing boom in areas where property prices are already soaring while pricing first - time buyers out of the market			1
@entity5 's house prices are now double those in many areas , and rising faster the @entity29 in @entity13 is now higher than the peak in january 2008 , but other parts of the @entity4 are still struggling help to @entity78 was launched by the government in the @entity80 to support £ 113billion worth of mortgages in @entity13			1
you will only need a deposit of at least 5 per cent on properties worth up to £ 600,000			0
the help to @entity78 scheme has two parts			0
the first , which is already live , provides a 20 per cent initially - interest free equity loan from the government , topped up with a 5 per cent deposit from the borrower so you could put down 25 per cent towards a mortgage			2
this is the bit that is running now and relates to @entity97			0
the second part , launching in january 2014 , and running for three years , will provide an indemnity on up to 15 per cent of a mortgage , giving banks and building societies more confidence to lend to those with a small deposit			2
by also indicating that he has private ‘ red lines ’ that would prompt him to walk out of the @entity108			0
row : chief secretary to the treasury @entity109 defended the help to buy scheme from criticism from @entity66 that it could fuel a new property bubble mr @entity66 has raised concerns about the second part of the scheme , and has proposed it being limited to regions outside @entity5			2
but today chief secretary to the treasury @entity109 rebuffed the concerns			0
‘ i do n’t see any sign of a housing bubble - far from it , at the moment , ’ he said			0
‘ the problem we have at the moment is twofold - one is we ’re not building enough houses as a country , we want to see more construction activity as part of that economic recovery			0
‘ and secondly that there are vast numbers now of young families who have a steady job who can afford the monthly repayments on a mortgage but simply do n’t have the resources to make a big deposit that banks now require			0
‘ i think it ’s a good role for the government to step in with a guarantee to help those people be able to get started - fulfil their aspiration to own a home			0
‘ but of course there will be safeguards in place : the scheme is time - limited for three years , and the @entity154 will have the chance to have a say if any government in future wants to continue it			0
but i think for the circumstances we have now , it ’s the right thing to be doing			0

@entity4 price rises fuelled by new boom in @entity5 and the @entity35
but regions see only modest increases or falls in some areas
@entity29 in @entity13 now higher than january 2008 peak
first time buyers paying 4 ***%*** more , compared to 3 ***%*** rise for existing owners
experts called for mortgage costs to rise in areas where prices rise by 5 ***%***
