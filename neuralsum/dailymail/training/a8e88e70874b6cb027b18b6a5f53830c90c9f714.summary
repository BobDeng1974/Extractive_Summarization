by @entity0 published : 14:22 est , 6 december 2013 updated : 16:55 est , 6 december 2013 @entity2 's wife is now saying that it was ' fate ' that she had a miscarriage earlier this year because they would n't have been able to spend as much time with his baby from a previous relationship			1
how much time they are able to spend with the 9 - month old is the basis of a contentious custody battle between the @entity16 skier and his ex-girlfriend @entity17			1
@entity17 , an ex-marine who moved from @entity18 to @entity19 when she was seven months pregnant , was awarded temporary custody of her young son over the @entity23 holiday , but now the bitter exes and their legal teams will be back in a @entity27 court next week for the next hearing			1
airing their views : @entity2 and his wife @entity31 , who he married shortly after ending his relationship with @entity17 , announced that she miscarried in january holding on tight : just before @entity23 , a judge overturned the previous custody ruling that gave the @entity36 the rights to the child he had with @entity17 ( pictured ) , allowing her to care for the child until december 9 @entity2 met @entity17 through a high - end dating service after they both expressed interest in settling down			1
their relationship did n't last long , however , but @entity17 discovered she was pregnant with his child by the time he had already begun dating his now - wife @entity31 , a professional volleyball player			1
@entity17 later released a text she sent to @entity2 after asking him to join her at an ultrasound appointment			2
he refused to go and wrote : ' @entity51 made this choice against my wish '			0
in october , @entity17 warned @entity2 that there was a possibility that she would be moving across the country : ' just a heads up , i met with an advisor from @entity60 today and we will probably be moving there in the fall			2
' that same month , he married @entity31 after dating for just five months and in november he submitted a ' petition to establish parental relationship ' in a @entity18 court , identifying himself as the father of a child who was not yet born			1
@entity2 and @entity31 announced that she was pregnant weeks later , only to reveal shortly after that she had a miscarriage			2
@entity31 and i had n't planned on getting pregnant , but we were excited			0
in hindsight , now , we can see what an incredible challenge having two babies would have been			0
i do n't believe in fate - that everything happens for a reason - but @entity31 does , ' @entity2 said in an interview with @entity83 , a portion of which is online			2
that reason is the fact that they want to gain more legal access to @entity2 's son with @entity17 , even though the relationship has grown so contentious that they refer to the boy using different names			1
@entity17 calls him @entity93 after giving the boy @entity2 's legal name , @entity95 , when she gave birth to him in @entity19 in february			1
fighting for his son : @entity2 and his wife had custody of the boy , who they refer to as @entity101 while his mother calls him @entity93 , for months leading up to the reversal before @entity23 evolving : @entity31 , a professional volleyball player , got pregnant expectantly but had a miscarriage shortly after announcing it virtual guilt trip : @entity2 , his wife and his daughter @entity108 ( right ) from another previous relationship celebrated an early @entity110 in @entity111 this week when @entity17 had custody of ' @entity101 ' and he posted this photo @entity2 later petitioned a court in his home state of @entity18 to add @entity116 as a middle name in honor of his brother who died in april			1
now he and @entity31 refer to the boy as @entity101			2
the couple argues that @entity17 has been conducting a virtual smear campaign against them , and while they maintain that they have not fought back , they are changing their ways now because it will effect the skier ’s career as he trains for the @entity131			0
her strike back : @entity17 posted multiple photos of she and ' @entity93 ' over @entity23 , including this one of them at the @entity135 's parade @entity2 , 36 , told the @entity136 on thursday that @entity17 , who is now studying at @entity60 , is directly attacking his brand			1
' ( @entity17 has ) been directly attacking that			0
it ’s so pointless in this case because it has no bearing on anything			0
it does n’t make any difference , ' he told the paper			0
' it ’s just , when you are in a position where things are n’t going your way — my wife does it all the time if she ’s losing a fight or something , she just switches the fight to something else that she thinks she can win at			0
just totally changes the argument to something else			0
it ’s not a bad tactic			0
it ’s just kind of pointless			0
' other factors are weighing in on the argument now , however , turning the case into a question of women 's rights as one @entity19 judge initially ruled that @entity17 was ' forum shopping ' for more favorable courts by moving from @entity18 in her third trimester			1
he awarded custody to @entity2			0
after that september 3 decision , @entity17 told the @entity177 that her ex and new wife wasted no time uprooting the boy as they came back to her apartment ' took the baby out of my arms , dropped it in a car seat and drove away			2
' a second judge then reversed that decision though the case is still ongoing			0
the @entity36 arrived at the @entity27 court with ' @entity101 ' in tow last week and @entity17 took the child after the hearing as she was granted custody over the @entity23 holiday and through till the next hearing on december 9			1
bi-coastal contention : after meeting @entity2 in @entity197 , @entity17 moved to @entity19 when she was pregnant and gave birth to the boy there , but the @entity36 argue she moved to be in a more favorable state for the custody case she has posted photos of she and ' @entity93 ' together in @entity19 over the past few days , including one of the pair attending the @entity206 parade			1
even though he did n't have his son near him to post new photos , @entity2 did n't let the social media war stay put there : he posted an old photo of ' @entity101 ' and @entity108 , his 5 - year - old daughter from another previous relationship			2
he and @entity31 had discussed online how they were celebrating an ' early ' @entity110 this week in @entity111 , and the picture of ' @entity101 ' and @entity108 read : ' she 's super sad her brother is n't here to celebrate with us			0
' @entity17 has custody of ' @entity93 ' until at least the next hearing on monday december 9 .			1

*newlywed* ski champ @entity2 is in a custody battle with an ex-girlfriend who moved to @entity19 while pregnant with his child
he initially wanted to be *uninvolved* in the child 's life but then changed his mind and now wants 50 - 50 custody but argues his ex has to move
