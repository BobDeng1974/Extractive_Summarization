the news comes just days after @entity7 's father said he did n't want secret grand jury indictments from his daughter 's case released to the public			1
@entity39 's attorneys sent a letter monday to the @entity54 district attorney saying the release of such records without releasing the entire grand jury record would only defame the former beauty queen 's parents			1
reports earlier this year suggested the secret indictments were of both @entity12 and @entity62			1
@entity39 's attorneys argued monday that to release only the indictments , and not the entire grand jury record , would put him at a disadvantage			1
help us find the killer : @entity39 looks on during a 1997 television appearance as wife @entity14 touts a reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the murderer of @entity7 ' public release of the allegations of an un-prosecuted indictment only serves to further defame ( @entity39 ) and his late wife @entity79 , ' the letter said , according to the @entity15			1
' mr. @entity39 will have no access to whatever evidence the prosecutors presented to the grand jury and will have no ability to disprove those allegations in a court of law , ' the letter continued			2
' nor will the public have any ability to evaluate the propriety of the indictment unless the entire grand jury record is unsealed and opened to public view			0
' the move to make the indictments public is an effort between the @entity42 and a @entity15 reporter			2
the indictments were earlier this year reported to be of child abuse leading to their daughter 's death , according to the paper			2
a grand jury voted at the time to go forward with the charges , but the district attorney declined to proceed over fears he could not prove guilty without a reasonable doubt , according to the paper			0
@entity111 : the @entity17 appear at the @entity112 in 2000 to answer questions about their experience with the media from journalism students sent on @entity39 's behalf , the letter was in response to a judge ruling last week that found releasing the indictments would not be in violation of grand jury secrecy rules , the paper said			1
that judge ordered the current da to provide reason why it should be kept secret , according to the @entity15			0
he provided them to a judge on tuesday to determine if they were suitable to be released			0
@entity39 's attorneys argued against this move , saying the father was never contacted about the release of any documents from his daughter 's case - adding that without releasing the entire record , the objective will not be achieved			1
' the @entity138 found ' transparency ' to be the determinative factor in its order to show cause , ' he said the letter			0
' transparency can only be accomplished if the entire record is made public			0
' ' the court should also order release of the entire grand jury record , including all witness testimony , all exhibits , all colloquy discussions between prosecutors and the grand jury and all drafts of potential indictments presented by the prosecutors of the grand jury , ' the letter continues			0
officials responded to the letter by stating they only release the secret indictments in such a way that would not hinder potential future prosecution under charges where the statute of limitations has not yet expired , according to the paper			2
the @entity17 were exonerated in 2008 from any responsibility for the girl 's death by the then - @entity19			0
the statute of limitations for the abuse charges expired in 2002 .			0
