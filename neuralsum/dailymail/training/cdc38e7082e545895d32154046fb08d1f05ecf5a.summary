it 's seen as the ultimate month for sunshine and glorious weather - but august is also the month you 're most likely to be struck by lightning			1
research shows the summer month is the peak time for thunderstorms - and that sheltering away from the inclement weather does not stop you being hit			1
findings from the @entity11 ( @entity11 ) show lightning can easily strike homes , as electrical currents surge through metal wires and pipes			1
august is the month that people are most likely to be hit struck by lightning , according to researchers from the @entity11 ( stock image ) the organisation , which has been researching lightning , storms and tornados since it was founded in 1974 , said almost as many people had been struck indoors as outdoors , even when windows and doors are closed			1
@entity29 and @entity30 told the @entity31 that a quarter of all indoor incidents took place while the person was either using or touching their landline phones - one of the most dangerous things to do during a thunderstorm			0
researchers from @entity11 revealed that 722 people were hit in @entity42 between 1988 and 2012 , an average of 29 each year			1
it compiled the figures using lightning incidents from the media , @entity49 reports and incidents sent in by the public			0
on average , this means two people are killed by lightning per year - though it is expected many more incidents go unreported			1
in 1982 , as many as 14 people were killed by lightning			2
but there were no deaths in 2000 or 2001 - the first year that had happened since 1937			2
researchers say being inside does not stop people being struck by lightning - and that a quarter of all indoor incidents take place while someone is using or touching the landline ( stock pic ) in @entity71 and @entity72 , about 80 per cent of those killed by lightning were men			1
that is believed men tend to work outdoors more than women , @entity11 says			2
the organisation says there are around 300,000 ground strikes by lightning every year in @entity42			1
on average , this means that someone is struck once every 6,000 strikes and someone is killed once every 100,000 strikes			2
a ' thunderstorm day ' may see up to 10,000 ground strikes			0
one of the most exceptional days in lightning history was on 24 july 1994 , when 85,000 ground strikes were produced , @entity11 said			0
their survey , published in the @entity92 's journal @entity93 , also tackled widely held myths about lightning safety			0
metal objects , such as necklaces and bracelets , do not attract lightning , but they do increase the risk of burns			0
mobile phones and earphones do not draw lightning , but they too can leave burns and may help to pass electric current into the body and cause more serious injuries			0
being sweaty can also lead to a greater risk of being hurt by the strike , as the moisture instantly vapourises			0
sweaty feet can also make shoes explode , they say			0
but the number of victims has halved since the 1960s , as fewer people work outdoors and health and safety has improved .			2

the summer month is the peak time for thunderstorms in the @entity42
report shows 722 people were hit by lightning in @entity42 from 1988 to 2012
same number hit indoors as outdoors - lightning can easily reach homes
two people killed on average per year - almost 80 per cent are men
