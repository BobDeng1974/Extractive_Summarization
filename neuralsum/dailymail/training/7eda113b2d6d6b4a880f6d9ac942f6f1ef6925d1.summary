just 16 seconds after two police officers pulled up in a patrol car and confronted @entity2 , he was dying in a hail of bullets			1
the young black man had been behaving erratically for some minutes , seemingly waiting for the police to come and get him after he walked out of a shop in @entity8 , @entity9 , with two stolen bottles of energy drink			1
scanning the street outside as he paced back and forth , he kept one hand thrust into his pocket , clutching the knife he was about to brandish			1
but as recorded by a local man with a mobile phone , @entity2 ’s end was brutally swift — and arguably unnecessary			1
after telling him repeatedly to drop the knife he drew from his pocket , the officers both opened fire with their handguns when he was about 10ft away			1
witnesses said 25 - year - old @entity2 was shouting : ‘ shoot me ! shoot me ! ’ @entity2 , 25 , pictured left and right , was seen leaving a shop in @entity8 , @entity9 , with two stolen bottles of energy drink			1
he was filmed scanning the street outside , pacing back and forth police later said he had been moving towards them threateningly , but that hardly seems obvious in the video footage			1
after letting off at least nine rounds — three times the number the entire @entity36 police fired in anger last year — the tragedy veered into farce as the officers decided to handcuff his lifeless body			1
what makes tuesday ’s shocking video footage particularly explosive is that it was taken just three miles from @entity46 , the @entity8 suburb which has been convulsed by serious unrest after a white policeman shot dead unarmed black youth @entity50 two weeks ago			1
the latest killing is guaranteed to inflame racial tensions in the @entity53 already reaching boiling point , and to fuel accusations that trigger - happy white police are mowing down young blacks without compunction			1
such claims — which for years have soured @entity53 ’s boasts to have overcome its ugly racist past — were compounded this week by alarming new footage of a policeman threatening to kill peaceful demonstrators in @entity46			0
the officer , who has been suspended indefinitely , was filmed repeatedly shouting : ‘ get back or i ’m going to f * * * ing kill you , ’ as he aimed his semi-automatic assault rifle at protesters			1
while officers in @entity46 have faced serious disorder in recent days , critics have pointed out that the almost military response of the police has served to exacerbate the problem by attracting violent troublemakers to the town			2
in the process , this @entity79 backwater has thrown up images of civil unrest the like of which have n’t been seen in the @entity53 since @entity85 was torn apart in 1992 after police were cleared of beating up black motorist @entity87			2
last sunday night , a man in his early 20s with a bandana covering his face was seen confronting an army of riot police			2
at one point , he lifted up his vest to show the handgun tucked into his low - slung shorts			0
it was unclear whether it was a warning , or a show of defiance			0
at that point , it was 12.45am , well past the midnight - 5am curfew set earlier that day , and the police were intent on clearing the main artery running through this working - class suburb			2
five heavily armoured swat team trucks had lined up across the street with around 100 riot police behind them			0
dressed in combat gear , gas masks and army helmets , and armed to the teeth with shotguns and assault rifles , they started advancing , firing tear gas into a 300 - strong crowd who threw back bottles , rocks and @entity124 cocktails			0
after police arrived , the 25 - year - old was filmed walking towards the car , brandishing a knife which he had drawn from his pocket			1
witnesses said mr @entity2 was shouting ' shoot me ! shoot me ! ' and so it has gone on , night after night for the two weeks since — just 100 yards away down a side street — officer @entity134 shot dead 18 - year - old @entity50			1
for days , events in @entity46 followed a routine			0
as darkness fell on this suburb of 21,000 people , the locals who had demonstrated peacefully during the day headed home , and the mood turned uglier			0
the street was filled with young — mainly black — men from out of town , sporting the occasional gang tattoo , who taunted the police with insults , chanting : ‘ @entity151 , do n’t shoot ’			1
taking the lead have been megaphone - clutching professional agitators from radical groups such as the @entity155 , who try to incite fights with the police			2
these left - wing rabble - rousers tend to be white , infuriating local black leaders who accuse them of hijacking the protest			2
the protesters have each night been faced by an impassive battle line of local and state police			0
clad in head - to - toe combat gear and aiming sniper rifles , they look more like soldiers			0
as well as firing tear gas , stun grenades and rubber bullets , they have even used a sonic cannon — or @entity173 — which emits a noise like a deranged ambulance siren			0
while he was 10ft away , the two police officers opened fire			1
they then handcuffed mr @entity2 's lifeless body at 8.30pm on sunday night , to the sound of sporadic bursts of gunfire , the violence took an ugly turn			1
police claimed they were being shot at in ‘ pre-planned agitation ’ , and went on the offensive			2
the tear gas started all over again , this time catching ordinary people still out on the streets			0
an eight - year - old boy was among those gassed			0
on monday , the police reported coming under ‘ heavy gunfire ’ and arrested 78 people as they tried to stop the looting			0
two demonstrators were shot but not — police insisted — by them			2
that night , officers were bolstered by the @entity201 , who arrived in a fleet of @entity205 armoured cars after @entity9 governor @entity206 took the drastic measure of calling them in			1
some community leaders said they had seen different street gangs working together to attack the police , and that members had said they wanted to kill a policeman in revenge for @entity50			1
nearly six years after the @entity53 elected its first black president , the unrest in @entity46 has graphically illustrated how the country ’s race relations are as rancorous and turbulent as ever			0
for all the feelgood , liberal waffle about @entity221 ’s supposedly ‘ post-racial ’ @entity53 , the last @entity222 country to ban slavery within its borders is still rife with racial tension			0
the incident took place three miles from where an officer shot dead an unarmed black youth , @entity50 , just two weeks ago the trouble started two weeks ago today after a scuffle involving @entity50 and 28 - year - old @entity134 ended with the teenager being fatally shot in a burst of gunfire			1
accounts as to how this happened differ sharply , although there seems to be agreement that @entity134 was inside his patrol car and @entity50 was leaning in through an open window as they argued whether the officer had the right to tell him to stop walking in the street and get on the pavement			1
the policeman ’s gun then went off — according to the officer , because @entity50 punched him in the face and tried to grab the weapon			1
but according to @entity50 ’s companion , @entity250 , @entity134 grabbed his friend around the throat and started firing when he tried to run away			2
despite @entity221 hoping the racial divide would be healed in the @entity53 , no one expects the president to do much about the latest incidents some witnesses say they saw @entity50 turn around and move threateningly towards the policeman , others say he stayed stock still and might even have put his hands up			2
either way , he was shot six times , including once in the face and again in the head			0
@entity134 has gone into hiding , suspended on full pay , while a grand jury considers whether to bring charges , a process that can take weeks			0
why might @entity50 have become violent ? possibly because — according to the town ’s police chief — @entity134 had realised that the teenagers fitted the descriptions of two youths who had just stolen cigarillos from a nearby convenience store			1
while locals painted @entity50 as a sweet kid keen to go to university , police released video footage of the shoplifting			1
it showed a huge teenager — apparently @entity50 , who was 6ft 4in — sauntering out of the store , shoving aside a small shopkeeper who tried to stop him			2
his friend @entity250 has reportedly admitted he and @entity289 stole the cigarillos , but the dead man ’s furious family accused the police of trying to poison their son ’s name and somehow justify his shooting			1
the video helped to divide reaction to the killing along racial lines : local community leaders say @entity46 is a powder keg that could blow up again any time , so long as the policeman remains uncharged			0
one thing ’s for sure , no one expects @entity221 — once a charismatic speaker decrying racial injustice — to do much about it			0
last week , he broke off briefly from holiday on the millionaires ’ island of @entity313 to appeal for calm , blandly assuring protesters he understood ‘ the passions and anger ’			0
@entity319 emonstrators insist they are protesting about far more than just the case of @entity50			2
curfew - breaking protester @entity321 said it was about everyday racial prejudice by the police			2
‘ it ’s about us riding down the street with three friends in the car and we get pulled over , ’ he said			0
locals say it ’s hard for outsiders to understand the depth of the divide in @entity46 , where a two - thirds black population has a 53 - strong police force , of which only three officers are @entity340			1
publicity hungry civil rights veterans such as @entity343 and @entity344 have followed the tv news crews pouring into town , anxious to ram home how this case symbolises everything wrong with @entity53			0
@entity50 is ‘ not on trial ’ , @entity344 thundered at a local church on sunday morning			0
‘ @entity53 is on trial ! ’ however hyperbolic the language , it ’s true that at the heart of this troubling story is the racial schism which once more threatens to tear apart the fabric of @entity340 society			0
when such men as @entity2 and @entity50 are killed , white @entity53 see a criminal and officers who must protect themselves ; black @entity53 see racist police who treat them with contempt			1
more than 50 years after @entity368 made his @entity369 about bringing an end to racism in the @entity53 , it seems black and white @entity53 mistrust each other almost as much as ever			0
additional reporting by @entity373 in @entity46 , @entity9 .			0
