by @entity0 but i never got payment protection insurance ... lack of legal powers means the government 's watchdog is unable to tackle spam text marketing firms companies that bombard the public with nuisance text messages are getting away with it because ministers are dragging their feet over fining them			1
rogue marketing firms send tens of thousands of spam texts every day , but the government has failed to change the law since a legal ruling seven months ago undermined powers allowing a watchdog to fine them			1
since then , information commissioner @entity21 has not issued a single financial penalty for spam texting			1
the watchdog has warned the ruling leaves it almost powerless to act			1
@entity26 , director of operations at the @entity27 , said the organisation was desperate for the law to be changed so ‘ we can stop these people who cause such a nuisance to so many people ’			1
there are also fears the ruling could be used by direct marketing firms to resist paying fines for excessive cold calling			2
however , the government has not even published plans to change the law			2
mr @entity26 said that before the ruling , the @entity27 had issued nearly £ 1million of penalties against firms breaking the law			1
but he warned : ‘ the problem we ’ve got at the moment is that the law requires us to prove calls or texts are causing substantial harm or substantial distress before we can issue a penalty			1
‘ we ’ve asked the government to make it easier for us to issue penalties , so that we need to simply prove annoyance or nuisance before acting			2
that law change would be a game changer			2
‘ there must be no further delay in strengthening our powers			2
nuisance calls are just that – a nuisance – and we believe that should be sufficient to let us consider a fine			0
’ the ruling came in the case of @entity66 , who escaped a £ 300,000 fine despite sending hundreds of thousands of unsolicited texts about payment protection insurance and accident claims			2
a tribunal ruled in november that such actions did not meet the legal test requiring ‘ substantial harm or substantial distress ’ to have been caused for a fine to be issued			0
until then , the @entity27 routinely used electronic communications laws to issue hefty fines against spam marketing firms			1
at the time of the ruling , the organisation said : ‘ if we are prevented from issuing fines , it ’s fair to expect the public will receive more of these messages			0
’ in the past 12 months , it has received 30,324 complaints about spam texts – nearly 600 a week			1
nuisance : a graphic from the @entity27 illustrates an example of a spam text the @entity27 asked for a new law a year ago – even before the ruling			1
without the change , it can only use ‘ cease and desist ’ court orders against firms			0
some companies pump out tens of thousands of spam texts a day trawling for responses on @entity103 , accident payouts and payday loans			1
anyone who responds – even by accident – can find their details sold on to other firms , and find themselves inundated with further texts or calls			0
the @entity113 said : ‘ we have increased the fines to up to £ 2million for companies who breach the law and legislated to allow @entity118 to share information easily with the @entity27			1
‘ we will shortly consult on lowering the threshold for when action can be taken against firms making nuisance calls and texts			0
’ everyone who uses a smartphone , laptop or tablet computer could face censorship by @entity130 under the @entity132 ’s new right to be forgotten rule , a @entity135 report warned yesterday			0
the law – which allows anyone to request for material about them to be taken off the internet – could apply not just to internet giants such as @entity142 but to every individual who uses the internet or social media			0
it could leave individuals open to legal challenges from people who want them to remove material from their @entity151 page , @entity153 account , or even from their own email or text records , according to the @entity135 @entity156			0
it said the right to be forgotten rule was wrong in principle and unworkable in practice			0
@entity132 judges ruled that people should have the right to demand that links to material about them are removed from search engines if the information is ‘ inadequate , irrelevant or excessive ’			0
peers said the rule ‘ logically ’ extended to users and urged ministers to ‘ ensure that the definition of data controller in the new regulation is amended to clarify that the term does not include ordinary users of search engines ’ .			0

court ruling *stripped* watchdog of its powers seven months ago
since then the @entity27 has not been able to issue a single penalty for spam texts
@entity27 official says the watchdog is desperate for the law to be changed
