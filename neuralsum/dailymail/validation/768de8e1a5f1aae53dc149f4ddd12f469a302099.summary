@entity0 has been busy during the off - season , parading on red carpets and awards ceremonies in suits and hats of an extravagant flavour			1
but for all he has enjoyed rubbing shoulders with the glitzy set , tweeting trysts with his ‘ brothers ’ from the worlds of music , film and fashion , the @entity8 season will open in @entity18 ’s @entity17 a week today and @entity0 ’s attention is turning to emulating the man he counted as a hero before he had ever heard of a rapper			1
for last year ’s championship victory , his second , put @entity0 one behind the late @entity25			1
@entity0 of @entity26 poses at the unveiling of the new @entity28 at the @entity8 winter tests @entity30 's racing driver @entity25 gives a thumbs up after he won the @entity32 @entity26 ’ pre-season dominance indicates that the 2015 season will be another straight title fight between @entity0 — of @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39 — and his team - mate @entity40			1
‘ the only landmark as a kid was watching @entity25 , ’ said @entity0 , who , as a nine - year - old karter hid behind his father ’s car so his dad would not see him cry when he learned @entity25 had died at @entity45			1
‘ he had three titles and , even though i do n’t really look at numbers and records , i always said that i wanted three ; to match @entity25			1
so if i have a third world championship , i would feel closer to him , although it was another era			2
i do n’t think anyone is as good as him , but it would still be a nice feeling			2
’ there are echoes now of @entity25 ’s era : the @entity30 ’s rivalry with his @entity60 team - mate @entity59 , the cerebral @entity61 , went into a second season , just as @entity0 ’s is with @entity40			1
@entity25 won the title in 1988 , but lost to @entity59 in 1989			1
so could @entity0 succumb to @entity40 , a steelier competitor than his blond , @entity65 - chic image once suggested ? the answer would seem to lie in @entity0 ’s own performance			1
if he drives to his potential , his natural talent will surely win him the title			2
but , as ever , he could be buffeted by emotional vulnerabilities			0
we remember 2011 when , pained by his split from singer - songwriter girlfriend @entity76 , his form suffered badly			0
this winter he again split from @entity76			0
will that have an impact on his psyche ? @entity0 has again split with former @entity81 singer - songwriter girlfriend @entity76 @entity0 and singer @entity76 attend the @entity83 awards at the @entity84 in @entity85 is he spending too much time flying from the @entity88 to @entity89 , a question given impetus when he missed a day ’s practice with a fever ? or are such questions an insult to a focused sportsman who , anyway , should not be begrudged the lifestyle his success has bought him ? ‘ last year i adapted , ’ said @entity0 , 30			1
‘ i had a mental attitude that was impenetrable			0
i feel that i still carry that mentality and , while it has not been easy ( splitting from @entity76 ) , i do n’t think it ’s going to be a problem			0
i feel as if i ’ve got enough in place to do what i need to do and be the best i can be			0
’ @entity0 drives his new car on @entity8 testing day in @entity108 in late february for the season preview more potential turbulence lies in his contract situation at @entity26			1
his three - year deal expires at the end of the season and he is negotiating his own terms , having dropped @entity116 as his manager			0
he wants parity with the highest earners on the grid , led by @entity122 new boy @entity121 , whose deal is worth 50million euros ( £ 36m )			1
@entity0 , who is careful with his money , as even his father has joked , has surprised @entity26 bosses @entity127 and @entity128 by how painstakingly detailed he has been in negotiations			1
‘ we ’re in the final stages , ’ revealed @entity0 last week			2
‘ i do n’t know what the timelines are and we ’re not rushing			0
getting it done before or after @entity18 does not matter			0
i ’m not sure i ’ve enjoyed it , but it ’s been an experience			0
if i ’d gone through my whole career and not done something like this i ’d have always wondered if i could or could n’t do it			0
the reigning world champion poses for a picture with @entity26 team - mate @entity40 ‘ i ’ve tried to do my due diligence and understand where we are and where it can grow to benefit the team and myself			1
we ’re not in a discussion where i ’m saying after winning the championship “ i want this ”			0
naturally , the target for every driver is to try to work towards being the benchmark			0
’ while @entity0 has noticed the presence of a few more photographers in his life , @entity40 has kept a low profile since missing out on the title in @entity162			1
he is said by a close associate to be ‘ mega-relaxed ’ , and declared in the @entity165 press that he knows he can win the title			2
he has devised a new breathing technique for high g - force corners , in which he previously stopped inhaling			0
his new method will help keep his concentration high for a longer distance , or so the theory goes			0
former @entity60 driver @entity0 poses for a picture in front of the @entity175 in @entity176 donning shades what about the rest of the field ? @entity181 , @entity122 and @entity182 are expected to fight closely for the other podium places			2
as for @entity185 , they have endured a pre-season horribilis : unreliability and lack of pace compounded by an unexplained injury to perhaps the best pound - for - pound driver in the world , @entity193 , who will miss the @entity195 @entity32 after hitting his head in an innocuous - looking testing accident in @entity108 a fortnight ago			2
he can sit back and watch the race in the early morning of his @entity200 sunday			0
just like everyone else , it seems , he will be helpless to stop the @entity26 machines			2
@entity26 driver @entity0 attended the @entity207 show in @entity176 during his time off from @entity8			1

@entity0 is currently one title behind the late great @entity25
@entity26 dominated pre-season suggesting @entity0 has a great chance
@entity0 is set to battle for the title with teammate @entity40 again
he wants parity with the big earners on the grid , led by @entity121
