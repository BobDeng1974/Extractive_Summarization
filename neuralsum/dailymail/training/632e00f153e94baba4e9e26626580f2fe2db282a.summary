muslim fundamentalists are plotting to take over state schools , according to leaked documents			1
activists have launched a campaign to oust headteachers using dirty tricks such as spreading false allegations and packing governing bodies with their supporters			1
the plot , which ringleaders have named @entity12 , has emerged in documents drawn up by the group and leaked to a local newspaper			1
the dossier names several schools in the @entity19 area as targets of alleged plots			1
the authors of the documents discuss extending the ‘ jihad ’ operation to @entity25 and @entity26 – cities with rapidly growing @entity30 populations			1
investigation : there have been allegations of faked resignation letters at @entity35 in @entity19 , possibly connected to a reported @entity37 operation by @entity30 fundamentalists last night @entity39 said it had launched an urgent probe to establish the authenticity of the documents , which are understood to name up to 12 schools			1
the investigation is being monitored by police and the @entity46 , which said it would not hesitate to take ‘ firm action ’ against those involved			2
the @entity49 understands education secretary @entity50 met the leader of @entity39 last month to discuss the documents			1
apparently written by fundamentalist @entity54 , the papers outline a five - point guide to forcing out a headteacher and installing supporters in key positions to ensure a school is run according to @entity30 principles			1
this involves identifying state schools in @entity30 areas which are underperforming and at risk of being turned into academies			1
under the academies programme , schools are removed from local council oversight			1
assemblies were allegedly carried out in @entity71 promoting radical @entity30 clerics with links to terrorism and extremist views one passage reads : ‘ we have caused a great amount of organised disruption in @entity19 and as a result we now have our own academies and are on our way to getting rid of more headteachers and taking over their schools			1
‘ whilst sometimes the practices we use may not seem the correct way to do things you must remember this is a “ jihad ” and as such all means possible to win the war is acceptable			2
’ one head , who is understood to have resigned following a plot to oust him , said last night his decision to quit had been ‘ vindicated ’			2
@entity94 , former headmaster of @entity95 , said he was unable to comment directly on the claims but confirmed he had been forced to leave his job			2
but he said last night : ‘ it was a difficult situation			0
it ’s a tough time			0
i am trying to move away from a very horrible , horrible experience , and i am pleased that it has been exposed			0
’ another headteacher targeted by the extremist group is understood to have been the victim of unfounded allegations that she was encouraging pupils to cheat in their sats exams			2
linked : @entity108 school was also named in the documents the documents are understood to refer to the group having ‘ planted the seed ’ of the allegations in order to undermine headmistress @entity113			2
the allegations against miss @entity117 resulted in her pupils ’ @entity121 results being cancelled			0
soon afterwards she resigned from her job at @entity124			0
at a third named school , @entity35 , police have launched a fraud investigation into claims from four staff members that supposed employee resignation letters had been faked			0
a fourth school , @entity132 , which is headed by @entity133 , was given a snap @entity135 inspection this week after claims were raised of unfair treatment of non-muslim staff			0
that school said in a statement last night : ‘ although we are not aware of any such campaign actually being carried out in relation to @entity71 , we are of course concerned about the school potentially being targeted for such action			1
‘ we remain on alert for any such conduct , and will act appropriately			0
’ the @entity37 documents have been leaked to media outlets including the @entity49			2
similar documents have since been sent to several head teachers			1
the council investigation involves several departments , including legal , audit , human resources and education			2
a spokesman said : ‘ we have received letters making allegations in relation to some schools in the @entity19 area			1
@entity39 is continuing to investigate these allegations and therefore can not comment further			0
’ @entity133 , @entity71 's executive head , reportedly said faith classes were being organised , but for after - school lessons @entity165 is being kept updated on the inquiry			2
chief superintendent , @entity167 , commander of @entity19 police , said : ‘ in december 2013 @entity39 brought the content of a letter they were investigating to the attention of @entity173 requesting we make an assessment of whether any criminal offences had been committed			1
‘ the assessment at that time and remains the case today is that the allegations in the letter were for further investigation by @entity39 and the @entity46 and were not a matter for the police			0
‘ the city council has continued to keep us updated on their enquiry in the event that any findings either warrant police investigation or impact on our joint delivery of @entity191 ( anti-extremism strategy ) across the city			1
’ a @entity46 spokesman said : ‘ we are aware of the serious allegations made in relation to some local authority schools and an academy in @entity19 , and are in close contact with a number of parties , including the police , the council and teaching unions			1
‘ @entity39 is investigating all these allegations and we are also looking specifically at the @entity132			0
‘ all schools are subject to a tough inspection framework and must meet the high standards and requirements rightly expected			0
‘ we will not hesitate to take firm action if these are not being met – in particular where we become aware of issues of concern in an academy we will move quickly to resolve these			0
’ the @entity37 documents appear to be correspondence between a @entity19 - based @entity30 fundamentalist and an acquaintance in @entity25			1
they outline a five - point guide for taking over a school and encourage expanding the operation to @entity25 and then @entity26			2
the recipient is first urged to identify any @entity227 parents – @entity30 fundamentalists – sending pupils to the school			1
‘ they are always the most committed to the faith and are hardliners in that regard and once charged up they keep going for longer , ’ the documents say			2
‘ when the parents have been identified , we start to turn them against the headteacher and leadership team			0
‘ the only way to do this is to tell each parent that the school is corrupting their children with sex education , teaching about homosexuals , making their children pray @entity248 prayers and mixed swimming and sport			0
‘ if you can get them to be very vocal in the playground as they drop off or pick up their children that will stir up other parents			0
‘ the parents must be given direction and told not to discuss this with anyone , you only need a maximum of four parents to disrupt the whole school , to send in complaints to question their child ’s education and to contact their mp and local authority			0
’ plot : it was claimed that fundamentalists ' planted the seed ' that the head of @entity124 , pictured , had encouraged pupils to cheat in exams further steps are to ‘ parachute in ’ @entity30 governors to ‘ drip - feed our ideal for a @entity30 school ’ and galvanise staff to urge the council to investigate the school			1
the document stresses the importance of having ‘ an @entity287 face among the staff group to make it more believable ’			0
anonymous letters should then be circulated to mps , press and ministers			0
the documents state : ‘ all these things will work toward wearing the head down , removing their resolve and weakening their mindset so they eventually give up			2
’ the documents state : ‘ @entity12 has been very carefully thought through and is tried and tested within @entity19 , implementing it in @entity25 will not be difficult for you			1
’ the operation , the papers say , has been fine - tuned so that it is ‘ totally invisible to the naked eye and allows us to operate under the radar ’			2
they go on : ‘ i have detailed the plan we have in @entity19 and how well it has worked and you will see how easy the whole process is to get the headteacher out and our own person in			1
’ state schools with poor @entity135 reports and with large @entity30 pupil populations should be targeted for takeover , the writer says : ‘ the poor performing schools are easy to disrupt , the better performing with strong head teachers are much harder and so we have to manufacture a strong enough reason , but rest assured we have not failed yet , no matter how difficult removing the head teacher may be			1
‘ you just have to be clever and find the most appropriate way to deal with the school			0
’ the documents add : ‘ this is all about causing the maximum amount of organised chaos and we have fine - tuned this as part of operation @entity12			1
you must identify what the heads ’ strengths are and build a case of disruption around that			0
’ @entity227 is a strong fundamentalist version of the faith that seeks to rid itself of modern - day ‘ impurities ’			0
followers believe in strict adherence to the @entity347			0
they argue worshippers have lost touch with the true nature of the religion and want to revert to the ancient form of @entity227			0
@entity227 comes from the root word ‘ ancestors ’ .			0
