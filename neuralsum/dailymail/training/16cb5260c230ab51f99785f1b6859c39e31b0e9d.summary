by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 05:12 est , 27 november 2012 updated : 12:15 est , 27 november 2012 @entity2 returned to @entity3 yesterday sporting her jungle hat from i 'm a celebrity @entity2 will not be reinstated as a @entity7 mp unless she apologises for taking part in i ’m a celebrity … @entity9 , it emerged today			1
the @entity11 mp was summoned to a meeting with conservative chief whip sir @entity13 where she was expected to explain her decision to abandon @entity15 for the @entity17 jungle			1
she has been told to ‘ rebuild bridges ’ with angry colleagues , but party insiders say there is little prospect of her returning to the conservative benches any time soon			1
after the 15 - minute chat , ms @entity2 said she was confident of having the @entity7 whip restored , and claimed being an mp was not a job but a ' life choice			1
she also criticised a @entity29 mp who had only attended two thirds of commons votes , despite him undergoing heart surgery			1
@entity34 is understood to be backing sir @entity13 in insisting that if she fails to show any remorse for taking part in the reality tv she will not have the party whip restored			1
the prime minister has made clear his unhappiness with her decision to swap @entity15 for the jungle , and ms @entity2 has used tv interviews since being kicked out of the reality show to claim she has been a victim of @entity48 briefings against her			0
she has also claimed she would ‘ do it again tomorrow ’ and used @entity49 to attack ‘ the snobs ’ who have criticised her			1
a spokesman for sir @entity13 said today : ' the whip has not been restored and nor will it be until she proves that she can rebuild bridges with her constituents , her association and her parliamentary colleagues			1
' but it is not thought likely that ms @entity2 will be able to persuade sir @entity13 to reistate her			1
‘ there is nothing to suggest she is going to get the whip back , ’ said a senior @entity7 source			1
‘ she has been told to rebuild bridges , but she has not got brilliant history on that			1
' you would think that with everything that has gone on , she would be contrite but on the contrary she is saying she would do it again			0
i do n’t think anyone in their right mind would look at @entity2 ’s response since she came back and not be quite flabbergasted			0
' ms @entity2 had claimed she wanted to reach out to voters through the tv series , but she became the first celebrity to be dumped out of the jungle the @entity11 mp used @entity49 to express her alarm at the media scrum as she arrived back in @entity84 , and defended taking time off from @entity85 ms @entity2 was suspended from the @entity7 after flying to @entity17 earlier this month			1
she claims to have had permission to take time off from @entity85 from then - chief whip @entity88 but admits she did not tell him it was to take part in the show			1
she claims that other mps have also taken long spells away from @entity85			2
she attacked @entity29 mp @entity95 on @entity49 for reporting her to the standards commissioner , telling him his own attendance rate was just 63 per cent			2
but he responded , pointing out that he had taken time off to recover from having open heart surgery			0
mr @entity95 wrote on @entity49 : ' imagine equating time off for open heart surgery with a paid for holiday on a reality tv show			0
says all we need to know			0
' but ms @entity2 was unrepentant , replying : ' i think with your 63 % attendance record , you should be quiet			0
@entity107 been taking a few holidays of your own ! ' speaking after the meeting with sir @entity13 , ms @entity2 said she was confident that the party whip would be restored			1

we have adjourned the meeting and we are reconvening this time next week , if not before			2
' ms @entity2 insisted that she wanted to carry on in @entity15			0

she insisted she would ' do it again tomorrow ' as she was confronted by paparazzi photographers at @entity3 yesterday after viewers made her the first contestant to be booted of the show			1
it is thought a major factor in deciding her fate will be the response from people in @entity11			1
a poll in her constituency carried out while she was still in the jungle revealed almost 60 per cent of conservatives ‘ disapprove ’ of her decision to abandon @entity15			0
asked to rate how they feel about @entity148 , ranked from 0 to 10 where 0 is ‘ extremely negative ’ , she scored just 2.82 , while 58 per cent said @entity34 was right to suspend @entity149 8 per cent said they were now more likely to vote for her			0
conservative peer @entity151 , who commissioned the survey , said : ‘ @entity2 said she was doing the show for the chance to talk to a huge audience about important questions , at a time when nobody pays attention to politicians			2
unfortunately , her constituents are not buying this			2
’ however , ms @entity2 says she has received hundreds of supportive emails and messages on @entity49 , claiming the media reaction to her absence has been ' slightly hysterical '			0
ms @entity2 said : ' i think my constituents have been fed a huge line			2
this how i have chosen to spend my holiday and this is what i 've chosen to do			0
when mps go on holiday they switch their phones off			0
' i think there has been a slightly hysterical reaction			0
' i think that some of the attention that i am receiving is to do with people thinking i 'm going to go to another party , but i 'm not			2
just because i 'm critical of @entity34 it does n't mean i 'm about to defect , ' she told the @entity186			0
' what the time in the jungle has meant is that no - one does n't know who @entity2 is in terms of being an mp , ' she added			2
the @entity11 mp claimed she wanted to use her appearance on i 'm a celebrity to discuss political issues in front of a tv audience of millions @entity7 strategists were appalled at pictures of mr @entity148 sunbathing at a time when constituents are struggling to make ends meet back home in @entity84 ' when i speak out about subjects in the future , people will know who it is that is talking about it , and i will have more of an audience			1
my colleagues in @entity15 say that i am now the best - known mp in @entity84			1
' ms @entity2 confirmed she will donate her mp 's salary for a month to local play schemes for children in her constituency , and insisted that reports of her fee from i 'm a celebrity - widely estimated at £ 40,000 - are ' massively exaggerated '			1
the @entity11 mp claimed she wanted to use her appearance on i 'm a celebrity to discuss political issues , including lowering the abortion limit , in front of a tv audience of millions			1
but none of the political conversations were aired			0
instead she was seen eating an ostrich anus and camel toe in a @entity228 and performing a series of bad jokes with @entity231 from @entity232			0
@entity233 , deputy chairman of the @entity234 , said a meeting about ' how to move on ' from the row will be held next week			2
he said : ' we will , of course , invite @entity2 to the meeting and we will listen to what she has to say			2
hopefully we can come to a conclusion as to how to move on			0
' she needs to establish a rapport with the constituency			1
i do n’t want to pre-empt anything until we have listened to her			0
' he said the local party office had received several emails about ms @entity2 ’ tv appearance			1
' most of the emails are not praising her for what she has done , ' he added			0
' it ’s been a very difficult time for everybody			0
' mr @entity34 is understood to be determined to send a clear message to other @entity258 his unhappiness at her decision to swap @entity15 for the @entity17 jungle			0
before flying home , she took a swipe at critics in her own party , claiming female mps who condemned her for abandoning her constituents were fuelled by ‘ jealousy ’			1
last thursday , when the @entity272 was debating women bishops , giving prisoners the vote and welfare reform , ms @entity2 was pictured going down a slide with @entity231 , @entity278 and @entity279 instead of taking part in commons debates , the @entity11 mp was seen chatting with former darts champion @entity283 in an interview before flying home , ms @entity2 was unrepentant when asked if she thought she would be frozen out on her return to @entity85			1
‘ do i care ? why would i know ? why would i be interested in that ? the word jealousy springs to mind actually , ’ she told @entity287 on @entity288			0
‘ i know what ’s happened			0
a lot of mps including the female mps , and the female mps i ’ve been told are the critical ones are the jobless and the more ambitious			0
