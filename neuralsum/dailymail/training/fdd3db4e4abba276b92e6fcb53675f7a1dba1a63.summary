by @entity0 published : 12:43 est , 5 september 2013 updated : 03:37 est , 6 september 2013 @entity1 , who used money from charity cancer appeals for himself , pictured at court today a man who stole nearly £ 1 million from children 's cancer charities , including one he set up to help his own son , has been jailed for five years			1
@entity1 was sentenced today at @entity9			1
he had been convicted of ten counts of theft and two of fraud by false representation			0
jurors heard significant sums of money were donated to the appeals @entity1 set up , but that little of the cash went towards treatment			1
instead the 50 - year - old spent the majority of the money on the charities ' running costs and funding his own ' interests , investments and personal lifestyle '			1
sentencing , judge @entity30 said : ' i believe you have a genuine desire to help families in the same position - however that does not fully explain your actions			1
' ' you abused the generosity of the public			2
your actions risked damaging the confidence in the system of charitable giving			0
' the court heard that @entity1 set up a string of appeals following the success of charities established to help his own son , @entity49			1
@entity1 set up @entity50 and the @entity52 after his son , then aged three , was diagnosed with neuroblastoma , a type of cancer , in april 2005			1
the money was to treat @entity49 at a specialist centre in the @entity58 , but it was later decided that he no longer needed treatment and @entity49 , now 11 , later recovered			2
it was then @entity1 turned his attention to fundraising for other children - enterprises which judge @entity30 said were ' fradulent from the outset '			1
@entity1 poses in 2006 with his wife @entity66 and son @entity49			1
he was fundraising to treat @entity49 's cancer , but spent the money on himself he established appeals for @entity71 , @entity72 and @entity73 , saying donations would be used to bring the youngsters to the specialist @entity76 in @entity77			1
but none of the money was ever used to treat the children , and @entity1 instead used the money to fund his own lifestyle			1
judge @entity30 said : ' these appeals were a fraud on the public			1
they were fraudulent from the outset , ' adding that they were used ' in part to maintain your lifestyle and image '			2
the court heard that @entity1 , formerly of @entity94 , near @entity95 , @entity96 , stole a total of £ 171,500 from the @entity52 , including donations of £ 60,000 made by charities @entity100 and @entity101			2
he also took more than £ 749,340.79 from the three appeals he set up to raise money for @entity71 , @entity72 and @entity73			2
the judge said : ' i accept that you did help other children			2
' but you were being generous with other people ’s money given for a different cause			0
' @entity111 , pictured here aged 4 , suffered from a neuroblastoma			0
he has since recovered from the disease the court heard that it was ' impossible ' to say how much money exactly went into @entity1 ’s bank account as he kept no accounts			2
however , he used £ 30,000 of money donated to the @entity52 to buy the @entity120 restaurant in @entity95 and invested £ 20,000 in a used car business			0
another £ 60,000 from the fund was put into @entity123			0
in mitigation , @entity124 , said : ' he is not the typical fraudster			0
this is not a case where he has enriched himself or lived a lavish lifestyle			0
@entity1 was sentenced to five years in prison today at @entity9 ( pictured )			1
he had been convicted of ten counts of theft and two of fraud by false representation ' his primary motivation was his desire to help other kids			0
clearly temptation got in the way because of the sheer amounts of money involved			0
' but judge mr @entity143 said : ' i do not for one second see him as some sort of latter - day @entity146			0
' there was , in my opinion , a very considerable element here of personal benefit and self - promotion as well as benefit to other children			0
' i will not accept any suggestion that all he was doing was trying to help other children '			0
the judge said there was ' something more selfish and arrogant ' than that .			0

@entity1 , 50 , established a cancer charity for his ill son , @entity49
but then he used money from the appeal , and appeals for three other children , to fund his lifestyle
he was jailed for five years today at @entity9
judge @entity30 said @entity1 ' abused the generosity of the public '
