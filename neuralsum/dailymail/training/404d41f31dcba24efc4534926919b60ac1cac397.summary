almost 600 patients are dying in hospitals each year because of hunger and thirst , figures show			1

' forgotten to death ' : almost 600 patients are dying in hospitals each year because of hunger and thirst , figures show , with bereaved relatives saying staff refused to help them eat or drink			1
( @entity20 image ) in recent years , however , numbers have fallen – suggesting the standards of nursing care are showing signs of improvement			1
the figures show that in @entity28 and private hospitals in 2013 , dehydration was recorded as an underlying cause of death or a contributory factor in 574 deaths			1
in 2008 the total was 942			2
in 2013 a further 336 deaths were logged with malnutrition being an underlying cause or contributory factor			2
the two figures can not be added together to give a total because some patients would have been recorded in both categories			2
another 88 deaths in care homes in 2013 were attributed to dehydration and 33 to malnutrition , according to the figures which were obtained by @entity47			1
the family of a retired engineer who died of acute dehydration have told how staff dumped drinks by his bed without bothering to help him reach them			2
@entity55 , 77 , was admitted to @entity56 in @entity57 with a chest infection and was later diagnosed with the superbug @entity59			2
he died three weeks later in july 2008 and , during his final days , his family say hospital staff failed to realise he was rapidly deteriorating			2
his widow @entity62 said last night : ‘ there was no record that was reliable of what he was being given			0
‘ he would be given drinks and they would be left there and occasionally they would be written up as given to him , but we knew when we were there that he was not drinking it			0
‘ however , it was described , it was n’t run in a way that met the patient ’s needs			0
and of course , because of that his condition was allowed to deteriorate and particularly , for him to become acutely dehydrated			0
’ busy : figures show that in @entity28 and private hospitals in 2013 , dehydration was recorded as an underlying cause of death or a contributory factor in 574 deaths			1
in 2008 the total was 942			0
( @entity20 picture ) the family have endured a five - year legal battle with the hospital to try to get to the bottom of exactly how the pensioner died			0
an initial inquest returned a narrative verdict – suggesting no - one was at fault			1
but the family appealed for a second inquest in 2013 which ruled mr @entity55 had died from dehydration			0
speaking to @entity47 , his widow added : ‘ the legal challenges that we faced along the way were very , very considerable but we felt we just had to persist			0
really to do justice to @entity105 ’s memory			0
and we just did n’t want other people to have the same experience			0
’ his son @entity108 said : ‘ i think in this case my dad was forgotten completely			1
it was the hospital ’s job to get the basics right and very clearly they failed			0
he was absolutely forgotten to death			1
‘ there was a whole range of things that should have happened monitoring hydration and nutrition and other things which simply did n’t happen			0
something went very badly wrong at @entity56			0
’ the @entity122 has long highlighted appalling neglect in hospitals and care homes as part of its dignity for the @entity129 campaign .			1
