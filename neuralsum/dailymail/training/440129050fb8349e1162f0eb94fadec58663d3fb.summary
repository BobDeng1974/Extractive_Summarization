a rare diary which was the first hand account of one of the victims of the brutal @entity3 in @entity4 was used to bring its last remaining leaders to justice			1
school inspector @entity7 kept the secret diary nearly 40 years ago , which vividly recounts the horrors of the radical communist regime			1
their experiment in social engineering claimed the lives of 1.7million people through overwork , medical neglect , starvation and execution			0
in one of the spiral bound notebook 's last pages , he wrote : ' why is it that i have to die here like a cat or a dog ... without any reason , without any meaning ? ' now it has emerged that mr @entity7 's diary was part of the vast case file , which helped to convict the only two surviving @entity3 leaders , 83 - year - old former president @entity26 and 88 - year - old @entity27 , the right hand man of the group 's infamous late leader @entity63 last thursday , a un-backed tribunal sentenced both men to life in prison for crimes against humanity - a verdict that many believe was too little , and far too late			1
written in @entity73 , the diary fills about 100 pages and is divided into two sections			2
@entity27 former second in command of the @entity3 , left and @entity26 , former head of state of the @entity3 , right , who were convicted of crimes against humanity at a tribunal last thursday the first summarises mr @entity7 's family history , an era spanning @entity84 colonial rule , the @entity86 occupation during the @entity87 and his arranged marriage to his then 15 - year - old wife			1
the rest , written as a letter addressed to his children , describes life under the @entity3 and is dated only at the start and the end - february 9 and july 29 , 1976 , with a final post-script entered a few days later			1
when @entity3 forces seized @entity98 on april 17 , 1975 , mr @entity7 and his wife were living with eight of their children in a rural town called @entity101			1
three days later , the guerrillas arrived and residents - including mr @entity7 - cheered , relieved the war was finally over , his 86 - year - old widow @entity103 recalled			1
but within hours , the @entity3 were emptying @entity4 's cities , marching millions of people into the countryside to work as manual laborers			1
mr @entity7 said how he ' did n't believe what was happening ' and kept saying , ` do n't worry , we 'll be back soon , do n't pack much , ' his widow said			1
@entity7 's daughter @entity114 reads her father 's diary , which details his experience of the brutal @entity3 regime his widow , @entity103 , left , pictured with her daughter and grandchildren says the diary is still too painful to read his notebook recounts how he was marched through forests and mountains for nearly two weeks			1
along the way , most of his possessions were confiscated , including four of the notebooks and a prized camera he had bought during a government visit to inspect schools in the @entity133 in 1961			0
ominously , he began hearing talk of execution sites ahead - what would later become known as @entity4 's killing fields			0
in his diary he wrote : ' we worked day and night clearing wood to make arable land , uprooting the trees , digging canals , building roads and dikes , planting vegetables and digging ponds			2
' we worked 10 to 13 hours a day			0
' food supplies dwindled , and mr @entity7 and his wife grew so desperate they traded clothes and a treasured family locket for salt , sugar and medicine			1
the following month , he fell ill and he could not work , but he had the privacy to write			0
but months later , he began sensing his end was near			0
an exhumed mass grave reveals the skeletons of people executed by the @entity3 during their rule in @entity4 corpses found in 1979 at a prison run by the former @entity3 government , about 18 miles north - west of @entity98 a @entity3 fighter stands guard as he watches forced labourers dig a water canal near @entity169 ' by now , my body resembles a corpse , thin with only skin and bones , ' he wrote			1
' i have no energy , and my hands and legs tremble			0
no power , no strength			0
i can not walk far or do heavy work			0
everyone works like animals , like machines , without any value , without hope for the future			0
' at one point , he writes of his regret at not being able to see all of his children as his two oldest sons were elsewhere in the country			0
the rest were forced to live in other parts of the village , working in mobile children 's work units			0
' let me die , ' he continued			0
' let my destiny take me wherever it goes ... my children , i miss you ; i love you			0
' mr @entity7 wrote until there were no pages left to write on , his wife said			1
on august 1 , 1976 , he wrote a postscript on the final page , asking his family to take care of the diary			2
a tourist looks at human skulls of genocide victims at the @entity215 , formerly the most notorious @entity3 prison , in @entity98 a wall of pictures , showing prisoners of the @entity3 regime line one of the museum 's walls in what was formerly @entity215 prison hours later , he was taken away by the regime to help lift a palm tree that had fallen in a paddy field			1
however , it was a lie as authorities had come to arrest him because one of his sons had attempted to exchange an @entity234 watch mr @entity7 had bought in @entity133 15 years earlier for fermented fish			2
mr @entity7 died several weeks later , in a nearby prison where he was kept chained to the ground			1
his widow says the diary is too painful to read now and says she did n't understand its importance at the time			2
she kept the diary safe for two decades , then passed it on to one of her daughters			2
it was the daughter 's husband who suggested giving the notebook to a documentation centre to protect the fragile , yellowed pages of history			0
it is ' the story of all of us who survived , ' said @entity256 , who runs the @entity257 of @entity4 , which has amassed millions of documents , photographs , films and verbal testimonies from the @entity3 era			2
