a @entity1 delegate from @entity2 is under fire for re-posting an essay on @entity5 that argues blacks are less intelligent and articulate than whites			1
the unwanted distraction as the @entity1 holds its annual @entity9 this week is creating new headaches just as the @entity11 is recovering from the scandal of a high - profile congressman who spoke to a white supremacist group 12 years ago			1
@entity15 , a former @entity2 state legislator and one of the committee 's two @entity2 delegates , shared the essay with his @entity5 audience on december 31			1
@entity23 , the piece 's author wrote in may 2014 , ' can not reason as well			2
they can not communicate as well			0
they can not control their impulses as well			2
they are a threat to all who cross their paths , black and non-black alike			0
' a self - described public defender in the southern @entity33 wrote the essay under a pen name , based on what he says were his experiences over the years representing mostly @entity39 clients			1
time to quit ? @entity2 @entity1 delegate @entity15 has come under fire before for posting inflammatory material on @entity5 , but his promotion of a racist essay is bringing opponents out of the woodwork @entity46 , a retired @entity47 lieutenant colonel and former one - term congressman , posted the essay two days before @entity15 did , allegedly giving the embattled @entity2 @entity1 the idea to share it the post , now deleted : @entity15 called the ' @entity53 ' magazine article ' enlightening ' ' most blacks are unable to speak @entity55 well , ' he claimed			1
' they can not conjugate verbs			0
they have a poor grasp of verb tenses			0
they have a limited vocabulary			0
they can not speak without swearing			0
they often become hostile on the stand			0
' ' many , when they testify , show a complete lack of empathy and are unable to conceal a morality based on the satisfaction of immediate , base needs			0
this is a disaster , especially in a jury trial			0
' ' @entity53 , ' a magazine described as a white supremacist publication by the @entity76 , published the piece in may 2014			0
the @entity78 includes the publication among its list of ' hate groups			0
' @entity15 told his 1,300 @entity5 followers that the essay was ' enlightening ' and ' a very interesting article by a public defender			1
' ' we are in a cultural battle , ' he wrote			0
@entity15 later removed his post from @entity5 but returned to defend himself tuesday morning , saying @entity46 , a black @entity1 politician and retired @entity47 lieutenant colonel , had blogged about the piece two days before him			1
' i do support col @entity46 's commentary concerning the authors [ sic ] article and not the content of the article itself , ' @entity15 wrote			1
@entity46 , a former one - term @entity98 congressman , had titled his dec. 29 blog entry about the @entity53 essay : ' quite possibly the most racist article you will ever read			1
' but he , too , defended the writer and his racial observations			0
' i ’m quite sure the progressive socialist left will criticize me for sharing this article – that ’s just who they are – they hate the truth , ' @entity46 wrote			1
' but if there is a war to be fought , it is for the soul of the inner city and the black community			2
' ' the facts and observations in this are not shocking to me			0
they are quite well known , but the manner in which the writer so eloquently presents them is quite commendable			0
' republicans may find @entity15 's presence at their @entity9 in @entity126 , @entity127 awkward , especially when the keynote speaker takes the stage at a lunch on thursday			2
that would be @entity132 , the only african - american party member to break into the public consciousness as a possible presidential candidate			0
@entity15 's fellow @entity11 , including many high - profile @entity135 from @entity2 , lowered the boom tuesday			1
a group of state legislators from @entity139 , @entity2 are asking @entity1 members to ' end our party 's long nightmare ' by showing the controversial @entity1 the door			1
' while we are disappointed it has come down to this , we believe this course of action is the only way to stop mr. @entity15 ’s hateful rhetoric from further tarnishing our party , ' the lawmakers wrote in a letter obtained by @entity154			2
' we urge @entity1 members , our colleagues and like - minded @entity157 to join us in stepping up and acknowledging that enough is enough			2
' blame game : col. @entity46 labeled the essay ' quite possibly the most racist article you will ever read , ' but then went on to praise the writer for sharing ' the truth ' @entity164 : the @entity166 story emerged just as @entity11 finished mopping up the mess caused when rep. @entity168 ( pictured ) admitted addressing a white - power group more than a decade ago @entity170 , the chairman of the the @entity172 's 14th @entity171 , wrote in a @entity173 op - ed that ' sadly , there is still a small but vocal faction that sticks by @entity166 in spite of his repeated broadsides against group after group			1
' ' they claim he is being " taken out of context " or that he is somehow being unfairly mischaracterized for his sincerely held conservative beliefs			0
' ' with every ignorant @entity5 post , ' @entity170 argued , ' @entity15 weakens and divides the @entity172 while reinforcing ridiculous stereotypes spread by its opponents			2
rather than strengthen and advance the @entity172 , @entity15 has done more damage to the @entity11 and the conservative cause than any @entity192 could dream of			2
' @entity15 did not respond to requests for comment , but an aide to a @entity2 @entity1 congressman told @entity154 tuesday evening that ' we all wish he would just dry up and blow away			1
' ' he 's an embarrassment , a liability , and just the sort of catnip the @entity203 of the world need to paint us all as backward @entity207 members , ' the staffer said			1
@entity15 has come under fire before for his social media posts			0
he shared an article on @entity5 two years ago titled ' @entity211 , ' which bashed gays for having a ' filthy lifestyle			1
' published by the defunct @entity215 , it claimed 50 per cent of suicides and half of big - city murders are committed by gays , that more than one - third of all gays practice sado - masichism , and that 1 out of 20 homosexuals is a child molester			1
' i did n't write these words , ' @entity15 would later insist			1
' i simply posted them			2
' @entity15 drew calls for his resignation in 2013 when he used @entity5 to distribute an anti-gay essay but his post included this warning : ' what is being pawned off on our children and grandchildren in public schools is the story that to be homosexual or lesbian is just another normal alternative lifestyle			1
' @entity239 reports that he has also argued president @entity240 is secretly a @entity241 and praised @entity243 president @entity242 for his country 's iron - fisted anti-gay policies			0
@entity15 also ' blamed @entity246 for dividing the @entity172 , ' claimed gay @entity33 want free health care because they suffer from @entity248 , and used @entity5 to distribute an inflammatory observation that asked : ' have you ever seen a @entity241 do anything that contributes positively to the @entity39 way of life ? ' he called that piece of writing ' eye - opening			1
' the @entity172 can ill - afford another race - based stick in the eye			0
it was just a week ago that rep. @entity168 , the @entity11 's @entity259 , admitted that he unwittingly spoke 12 years ago to a group of white supremacists while he was a state legislator in @entity262			2
@entity263 points out that the @entity264 has its own @entity15 - style scandal brewing			2
@entity266 , a committeeman from @entity267 and a major donor to president @entity240 's campaigns , remains on the party 's roster even though he faces criminal charges related to alleged sexual contact he and his ex-boyfriend had with a 15 - year - old boy .			0
