by @entity0 for @entity1 victims of crime groups have attacked a call from euthanasia campaigner @entity5 to let killers serving life sentences choose the timing of their own ' peaceful ' deaths behind bars			1
dr @entity5 has said @entity12 inmates facing life in jail should be given the same opportunity as a @entity17 rapist and murderer who a court has granted the right to die with the help of prison doctors			1
killer @entity23 raped and murdered a 19 - year - old woman after being released from serving sentences for other sexual offences			2
released again , he attacked three more victims , including an 11 - year - old girl			0
now locked up indefinitely 23 hours a day , van den @entity23 successfully applied to a @entity17 court for the right to die at a time of his choosing rather than endure what he describes as unbearable psychological suffering in jail			1
murderer and rapist @entity23 has been granted permission by a @entity17 court to die at the hands of prison doctors			1
dr @entity5 said on monday he believed @entity12 prisoners facing life in jail without parole should be given the same opportunity as van den @entity23			1
not to do so was ' equivalent to torture '			2
' when i first heard that the prisoner was going to be allowed to have his request to have a peaceful death respected , i was very pleased in the sense that it was something that i 've believed for some time â€“ that a person who is incarcerated for an indefinite period and that 's certainly his case [ should be able to have the option of euthanasia ] , ' he told the @entity60			2
' it looks to me like the state is not only prepared to incarcerate people forever in certain circumstances , but to try and maximise the suffering of those individuals , and i do n't think we should have any part of that , at least in these situations , offer these poor people the option of a peaceful death			2
' to me , that 's equivalent to torture and i think it 's something that the state should not be involved in			2
' euthanasia campaigner @entity5 wants @entity12 inmates serving life sentences to be allowed to choose the timing of their own deaths behind bars			1
@entity82 , president of the @entity83 , was appalled			0
' i find it most abhorrent , ' mr @entity82 told @entity1			0
i just find that unbelievable			0
' in august 1994 , mr @entity82 's one - time business partner @entity85 was shot dead with a crossbow bolt by @entity87 , who months later stabbed a cab driver to death before he was arrested , convicted and sentenced to life in jail			2
mr @entity82 said dr @entity5 's description of convicted murderers as ' poor people ' who deserved the option of ' a peaceful death ' was offensive			1
' what about people like @entity85 who was n't offered a peaceful death ? ' mr @entity82 said			0
' i mean , @entity87 is in jail as punishment , as well as for the protection of the community			0
he wrecked our lives and we just want to see him never get out of jail			0
we want him to pay the price for it			0
' i do n't feel for these " poor people "			0
they are criminals who have sinned against society , for @entity111 's sake			0
' killer and rapist @entity23 has been granted his wish to be put to death by prison doctors rather than endure ' unbearable psychological suffering ' in jail			1
@entity118 , vice president of the @entity119 , said dr @entity5 's comments failed to recognise the importance of both deterrence and punishment in sentencing for serious crimes			1
mr @entity118 said it would be illogical to allow a convicted murderer the right to take another life , even if that life were their own			0
' i still have a huge problem with anyone taking another person 's life , ' he told @entity1			0
@entity5 says keeping killers locked up indefinitely without the right to euthanasia is ' equivalent to torture '			1
dr @entity5 is reportedly to be investigated by police forces in every @entity12 state over his role in almost 20 deaths of the past three years .			1

' dr death ' @entity5 says murderers deserve right to euthanasia
@entity5 says the alternative is ' equivalent to torture '
call follows @entity17 court *decision* allowing killer to die in jail
