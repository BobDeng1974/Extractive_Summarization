whether grainy movie reels featuring marching armies of khaki - clad soldiers heading towards the front line or harrowing images that reveal the aftermath in bloody detail , @entity0 was among the first to be documented in photos and on film			1
now a new exhibition is to combine rarely seen photos of men and women fighting in the @entity0 with a series of harrowing artworks that shed light on the human tragedy that ensued			1
@entity0 in @entity18 , which debuts at the @entity19 next month , also tells the stories of some of the most fascinating participants , among them a @entity24 female soldier , a @entity26 nurse executed by the @entity27 and the first @entity29 recipient of the @entity30			1
the @entity31 : @entity33 's 1918 work was based on sketches made on the front line harrowing : two of the portraits from @entity39 ' series , soldiers with facial wounds others , among them the striking @entity39 ' series , @entity43 , document the experience of disfigured @entity26 soldiers and their treatment in the hands of dr @entity48 - one of the founding fathers of modern cosmetic surgery			1
his techniques , pioneered at the @entity52 at @entity53 and @entity54 in @entity55 , were used to reconstruct the faces of injured soldiers , with @entity39 on hand to provide the before and after shots			2
equally startling is @entity61 1919 effort , @entity62 , which was commissioned by the government - sponsored @entity63 for the @entity65			2
charged with recording the medical consequences of the war , @entity61 , who served with the @entity66 , offers a painfully frank account of the risks faced by both soldiers and support staff			1
harrowing : @entity74 's 1917 work , @entity75 : the 42nd @entity76 record : @entity61 was commissioned to paint @entity62 in 1919 but not every soldier to appear in the new exhibition does so through an artists ' gaze			2
many more peer shyly out of the exhibition 's vast collection of photographs			2
and it 's not just men : some of @entity0 's female participants feature , among them @entity89 , the exotic @entity91 dancer executed by the @entity92 after being accused of spying for the @entity27 , and @entity93 , a @entity24 peasant woman who became a soldier with the blessing of @entity96			1
although badly injured in 1916 , @entity93 later went on to form the 2,000 - strong 1st @entity24 @entity97 in 1917			2
sadly , after the @entity98 ended @entity24 's involvement in the @entity0 , @entity93 was deemed surplus to requirements and was executed in 1920 by the communist regime			1
another woman to suffer a similar fate was @entity26 nurse , @entity103 , whose daguerreotype portrait also appears in the exhibition			0
executed : @entity93 died at the hands of the @entity108 while @entity89 was killed by the @entity92 brave : @entity26 nurse @entity103 ran a network of safe houses for @entity113 soldiers but was executed in 1915 her story began in the village of @entity116 in @entity117 , where she grew up before moving to @entity118 to train as a nurse in 1896			0
in 1907 , she moved to @entity120 to become the director of a training school for nurses but was caught behind enemy lines after the @entity27 invasion of @entity126 in 1914			0
the school became part of a network of safe houses created to shelter @entity113 soldiers before smuggling them into the @entity91			0
less than a year after the invasion , @entity103 was caught by the @entity27 and on the 12th october 1915 , she was executed by firing squad			0
her final words were , ' i am glad to die for my country			0
' unlike @entity103 , not every soldier fighting in the war did battle on behalf of the country of his birth			1
as the exhibition makes plain , many troops fighting for @entity26 hailed from the @entity142			0
in addition to 100,000 formidable , knife - wielding @entity149 , troops from @entity144 , @entity145 , @entity146 and @entity147 went into battle alongside their @entity26 brethren			0
@entity152 was the first @entity29 soldier to win the @entity30 @entity153 , a @entity154 , also won the @entity26 's highest military honour private @entity156 , from @entity157 , enlisted at 15 and was killed aged 18 captured : this @entity27 soldier was taken prisoner by @entity161 and @entity162 troops at @entity163 among them was @entity152 , the first @entity29 recipient of the @entity30 , whose heroics saved the lives of three injured comrades during the 1915 @entity168			0
another was @entity170 , a @entity154 serving in the @entity171 , @entity172 , who earned a @entity30 while fighting on the @entity174			0
equally brave were @entity26 recipients of the @entity26 's highest military honour , among them private @entity177 who won his for capturing an enemy strong point and nine prisoners single - handedly			0
peering out of grainy black and white photos , the portraits of @entity181 and his comrades offer a very human perspective of what turned out to be a spectacularly inhuman struggle			1
