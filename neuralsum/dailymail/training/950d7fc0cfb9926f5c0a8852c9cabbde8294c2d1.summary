by @entity0 published : 17:14 est , 27 september 2012 updated : 17:14 est , 27 september 2012 the country ’s most senior judge said yesterday that the interminable delays in extraditing hate preacher @entity4 were ‘ a source of real fury to me ’			1
lord judge , the lord chief justice who heads the judiciary in @entity10 and @entity11 , said of the eight - year wait : ‘ we really ca n’t have cases taking that long to reach a conclusion			1
’ he pointed to the @entity16 as the institution most to blame for the delay in the extradition of the hook - handed cleric to the @entity21			1
' great public interest ' : lord @entity23 , the lord chief justice , left , has revealed his personal sense of ' fury ' at the delays in clearing the extradition of hate cleric @entity4 , right , to the @entity21 to face terror charges ‘ i do not think , if you go through the processes , you will discover that the delays in that particular case , or in many like it , are actually to be levelled at the doors of the courts here , ’ the lord chief justice said			1
he spoke as @entity4 – who has already served a jail sentence in @entity39 for offences under the @entity41 – mounted yet another attempt to stave off extradition			1
a claim on the basis of alleged new evidence is to be heard by a judge next month			0
lord judge expressed his anger at the glacial pace of the proceedings during a question and answer session with journalists			1
he said he was not commenting on an individual case – but made it clear that his remarks referred to the @entity4 affair			2
‘ any case that takes eight years through a whole series of judicial processes to come to a conclusion – and you have made the point that it has n’t yet come to a conclusion – is a source of real fury to me , ’ he said			0
‘ we really ca n’t have cases taking that long			0
it is not fair to anybody			0
that is all i can really say about it			0
’ glacial pace : the @entity16 in @entity76 , @entity77 , where judges took four years to finally rule that the extradition of @entity4 was indeed lawful the @entity4 saga began in may 2004 when he was arrested on a @entity21 extradition warrant			1
he is wanted in @entity21 for conspiring to take hostages in @entity83 , funding terrorism , and , between 1998 and 2000 , organising a terrorist training camp in the state of @entity87			2
extradition proceedings were on hold between october 2004 and 2007 while the preacher was tried and convicted on @entity39 terrorist charges			2
in may 2007 a preliminary extradition hearing was held in @entity93			0
@entity39 proceedings ended in july 2008 when lord judge himself , sitting in the @entity97 , said the extradition decision was beyond further challenge in the courts and raised no point of law worth taking to the @entity103 , the highest court in the country , now replaced by the @entity105			1
yesterday lord judge recalled : ‘ i was one of the judges who decided that case in the extradition proceedings … so far as we were concerned , that was the end of it			1
’ however in august 2008 @entity114 human rights judges in @entity76 said that @entity4 could not be extradited until they had considered the case			2
they did not rule that the extradition was lawful until april this year			1
@entity4 leading worshippers outside the @entity118 : he has already spent time in a @entity39 jail for offences under the @entity41 a final appeal to @entity76 was rejected earlier this week – more than four years after the @entity114 judges started to deal with the case			2
the extradition has now been delayed by a further @entity39 appeal , brought by his lawyers on the grounds that there is fresh evidence to be considered			0
lawyers led by @entity131 have deposited papers at the @entity133 which say they want a judicial review of a @entity136 decision to recall @entity4 ’s @entity39 passport			2
they say he needs the passport to establish his identity and get legal representation in the @entity21			0
the case will be heard at the @entity133 next week			0
lord judge said : ‘ the problem is not that there is n’t a limit on the number of appeals			1
the problem is that new points keep coming up and new points are taken and then they go through the process			0
‘ what you need is a process in which all the points which need to be addressed are addressed once and then there is an appeal process and it comes to an end			0
any case that takes eight years – unless there is some extraordinary explanation … is unacceptable			0
’ lord judge added : ‘ in those sort of cases , alleged terrorist cases , well , actually , there is great public interest in disposing of them fairly , justly , but with speed			1
