for her entire life , @entity0 never existed			1
there is no paper trail to confirm her place on earth because there was no proof that she was ever born			0
she 's never driven a car , voted , had a bank account , or picked up a parcel from the post office ... she 's never even had a holiday tan			1
but the 20 - year - old has become a born - again citizen , after a lifelong battle to get a birth certificate			1
i exist ! @entity20 has never been able to drive , travel abroad , vote , open a bank account , get a job , or a flat , and or even pick up a parcel from the post office she was born in @entity27 while her parents were on holiday but was never given a birth certificate by the @entity27 hospital			0
instead she was handed paperwork by the @entity27 hospital so she could come home - but was told by @entity35 authorities it was n’t enough for her birth to be registered			1
it means she has not officially existed for the last 20 years - and has had no way of proving who she really is			2
when her friends started clubbing and drinking in pubs she had to stay at home because she had no @entity45			0
cute : @entity0 's parents were told they had been given the correct documentation by the @entity27 hospital , but when they returned to @entity49 the @entity35 registrars refused to accept the details as proof of birth @entity0 missed school trips and was even stayed at home alone when the rest of her family have gone on holidays abroad together			1
in a moment of desperation she wrote to the @entity60 asking for help , but was told the matter was ' not a human rights issue '			1
but lawyers disagreed and launched a four - and - a - half - year campaign to get her a birth certificate			1
@entity0 told how she ca n’t wait to go on holiday , adding : ' i want a real tan - i ’m fed up with fake tans			1
i am going to go on holiday with the money i have been saving			0
' @entity0 , who hopes to work as an administrator in the @entity74 , said : ' it ’s been incredibly frustrating			1
finally : the 20 - year - old has now become a born - again citizen , after finally being given a birth certificate ' my mum and dad thought they had the right papers to register me in the @entity35			1
but when they were translated they were told they had the wrong paperwork			2
' we were told it was n’t my right to have a birth certificate			0
but how can that be when not having one means i can not do things that everyone else can ? ' the government were so unhelpful - they just did n’t want to know			0
' she added : ' my 18th birthday was not the big landmark that other people ’s were			0
everyone was going to bars and clubs but i could n’t go because i did n’t have any identification			0
' it has been very upsetting and such a long time to wait			0
' @entity0 , from @entity103 , @entity104 , was born in @entity105 , @entity27 , on september 25 , 1991 , while her parents @entity107 , 60 , and @entity108 , 56 , a porter , were on holiday			1
her parents were told they had been given the correct documentation by the @entity113 , near @entity105 on the @entity114 , to register the birth			0
but when they returned to @entity49 the @entity35 registrars refused to accept the details as proof of birth			0
without a valid @entity27 birth certificate @entity0 has never been able to register her birth in the @entity35 , or apply for a passport			2
her father @entity123 returned to @entity105 when @entity0 was a toddler to confront @entity27 officials in person - but they told him the hospital had no record of his daughter ’s birth			1
luckily @entity0 was given a place at school and then at college and her mother @entity133 was able to persuade the government to pay child benefit for her			2
but when @entity0 was a teenager her lack of proof of birth and @entity45 started to become a bigger problem			2
first she was refused a saturday job at a supermarket then she was left with no way apply for university funding			0
with lack of @entity45 creating a growing number of problems , her family wrote to the government , mps and even the @entity60 for help with no avail			2
but after a four - and - a - half - year battle by international law firm @entity152 has finally been given a @entity27 birth certificate			1
@entity0 ’s mother @entity133 said : ' we are so pleased for @entity0			2
' it has been so hard , but it is going to open up a world of possibilities for her			0
' we had tried everything and we were scratching our heads over what to do so the lawyers came in at just the right time			0

@entity0 won recognition after 4 *1/2* year legal battle
she now wants to follow dream to go to @entity169 - and get her first real tan
even when she appealed to @entity60 , she was told : ' it 's not a human rights issue '
