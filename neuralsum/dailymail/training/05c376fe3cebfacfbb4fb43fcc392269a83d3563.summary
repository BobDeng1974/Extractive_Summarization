@entity12 had wanted ' total privacy ' imposed upon early proceedings of his multi-million pound @entity10 case involving @entity17			1

legal wrangle : @entity2 oligarch @entity12 , left , wanted details of a @entity10 battle with @entity17 , right , kept secret			1
the pair are pictured during his previous legal fight with @entity4 the ruling read that ms @entity17 - the mother of the couple 's two children who sat alongside mr @entity12 during much of his legal wrangling with @entity4 - was complaining that she had not received millions she had been promised by her former partner			1
a freezing order of up to £ 200million of mr @entity35 's assets was already made last month with justice @entity20 asked to discharge that order			0

he did not disclose a total figure			0
mr @entity12 is expected to ' vigorously contest ' his former partner 's legal claim			2
he had originally wanted the proceedings to be removed from court listings which are freely available to the public			2
defeat : mr @entity12 lost a legal claim against @entity5 owner @entity4 last year but written representations by journalists argued that there was a danger that people would think that the rich and powerful are allowed privileges if the case was held in private			1
mr @entity20 said in his ruling : ' on the evidence , mr @entity12 is a man under financial pressure			2
' it is likely he will feel a more pressing need to satisfy creditors than satisfy ms @entity17			0

mrs @entity68 dismissed a series of claims by mr @entity12 - who wanted more than £ 3billion damages from @entity4 - and the loss left mr @entity12 facing legal bills totalling tens of millions of pounds			1
