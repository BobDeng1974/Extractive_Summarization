@entity0 has every right to feel aggrieved and bewildered by his omission from this @entity4 squad - which is otherwise a largely logical selection based on current fitness and form			1
the @entity9 fly - half is without question one of the country 's three leading no 10s at present , but he has been overlooked despite making a favourable impression when recalled for the june tour of @entity15			1
as exclusively revealed by @entity18 last week , head coach @entity16 and his assistants have chosen @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 as their stand - offs			1
backs : @entity53 ( @entity30 ) , @entity54 ( @entity38 ) , @entity55 ( @entity56 ) , @entity57 ( @entity42 ) , @entity58 ( @entity36 ) , @entity59 ( @entity38 ) , @entity60 ( @entity42 ) , @entity61 ( @entity38 ) , @entity62 ( @entity36 ) , @entity63 ( @entity36 ) , @entity64 ( @entity48 ) , @entity65 ( @entity30 ) , a @entity66 ( @entity42 ) , @entity67 ( @entity48 ) , @entity68 ( @entity69 ) , @entity70 ( @entity36 ) , @entity71 ( @entity30 )			2
there can be no quibbling with the inclusion of the first two men , although @entity19 's lack of game - time this season is cause for concern			1
he has started just once for @entity42 and missed three matches with a hamstring injury , before making a late cameo comeback last saturday			0
it will be intriguing to see if his club help @entity4 out by naming @entity19 in their line - up to face @entity87 on friday , or keep him in reserve as @entity89 is playing so majestically			1
of course , there may be a compromise option with @entity19 in midfield , which is a scenario the national team may also consider , with @entity58 as the primary playmaker at 10			1
the @entity36 tyro has been mostly very impressive in the early stages of this campaign , but he - along with many of his club - mates , suffered a chastening experience in @entity101 last weekend			0
yet , that did n't harm his test prospects as he had already done enough to make the cut			0
@entity20 ( right ) has made a good start to the season even though his @entity36 side were beaten by @entity101 november 8 vs @entity15 november 15 v @entity108 november 22 v @entity109 november 29 v @entity110 it is the third fly - half place which prompts the heated debate			1
@entity16 and the rest of the @entity4 management team had more or less settled on their selections last week , but the first round of @entity119 matches held their thinking up to awkward scrutiny			1
for 40 minutes in @entity122 , @entity0 was magnificent in leading @entity87 a merry dance			1
some shaky moments followed , but he will always create more problems for the other team than his own			0
he has a range of individual skills and a sheer audacity that @entity21 does not deliver for @entity38			2
in the first week of the season , the @entity132 ' stand - off was superb against @entity48 - showcasing a greater variety of kicking and distribution than in the past			2
but he will often act as a steady link - man for his club ; bringing in powerful runners around him and kicking his goals			0
he is seen as steady and reliable , but he missed a crucial kick in @entity143 on saturday as @entity38 lost , whereas @entity0 's goal - kicking was immaculate for @entity9 , on a high - pressure occasion			1
@entity16 's decision to pick @entity21 over @entity0 is a conservative and cautious decision the decision to pick @entity21 ahead of @entity0 is a conservative , cautious one , which deprives @entity4 of the option of turning to a creative player who could pull a rabbit out of a hat when they are chasing a game			1
this squad announcement was delayed in order for relevant form to be taken into account , but that does n't appear to have happened in this case			2
choosing @entity162 as one of the wings makes sense as the @entity167 - born @entity36 flier has been the most effective wide - man in the @entity169 this season			2
the omission of @entity172 is harsh on the basis of his fine club form , but comes down to doubts stemming from his tour efforts			0
yet , there have also been management doubts about @entity181 , but he is in			0
@entity162 ( with ball ) has been the most effective wide - man in the @entity169 this season the loss of @entity184 to injury is a savage blow to @entity4 's autumn prospects , but the inclusion of @entity189 is the right response			1
he has been superb for @entity36 - running with real menace and scoring tries			0
@entity194 is an area of regular concern for @entity23 , but the coaches are right to give @entity198 the benefit of the doubt			0
up front , a raft of front - five injuries limited the coaches ' options , and there can be few arguments with their selections			0
in the absence of @entity211 and @entity212 , there was a tussle for the fourth lock place and @entity215 of @entity42 has won the vote			0
in the back row , @entity217 has been excelling for @entity38 and his consistency of late has been fairly rewarded			0
@entity220 : @entity4 will be ready for @entity24			2

@entity0 will be aggrieved to have been left out of the squad
he has been one of @entity4 's best no 10s this season
as @entity18 revealed , @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 are in
the decision to pick @entity21 over @entity0 is a cautious one
