in the year that has seen the likes of @entity3 , @entity4 and @entity5 all reveal their toned torsos , there has been a dramatic rise in the number of male patients in their fifties and sixties seeking cosmetic treatment in order to achieve a more defined , muscular physique at a later stage in life			0
one such man is 54 - year - old @entity18 , who has undergone laser liposuction and pec implants to keep up with his 33 - year - old wife			1
@entity18 from @entity22 , @entity23 , was once in very good shape – exercising regularly and eating healthily – but nevertheless he struggled to maintain a body that was toned and muscular through exercise alone			1
honed to perfection : 54 - year - old @entity18 underwent a new type of lipo called @entity31 so that he could keep up with his 33 - year - old girlfriend in his younger days @entity18 , who owns his own marketing company , was better able to achieve the results he wanted but after starting a family and living a busy working life , he struggled to maintain a lifestyle that was active enough to give him the body he wanted			1
@entity18 ’s wife @entity39 is also 21 years his junior and so the pressure to look fit and in shape alongside her was even larger because of this age gap			1
in the end he resorted to a treatment called @entity31 high def at @entity47 , performed by dr @entity48			1
the treatment was carried out under local anaesthetic and involved melting away the unwanted fat and removing it via a tiny canula			1
maintenance : @entity18 struggled to maintain a lifestyle that was active enough to give him the body he wanted alongside his younger wife dr @entity48 targets the underlying fat during the procedure and suctions it out around the musculature to create a more defined , finished result			1
speaking to @entity62 , @entity18 said : ' you can only go so far with exercise and at my age it 's much harder to keep the weight off			1
' i do a lot of cardio but it 's hard to shift the fat in certain areas , especially after a certain age			2
' the good thing about this treatment is it 's targeted weight loss off the area you want to lose it from			0
i had love handles and fat below my pecs and i wanted to get rid of it			0
' he underwent the treatment six months ago and it set him back £ 10,000 but he maintains that it was worth every penny			1
before and after : the candid photographs show the before ( @entity92 ) and after ( r ) effects of the £ 10,000 treatment he said : ' now i feel so much more confident and i love walking around without my top on			1
' i like to go to @entity96 every summer for a few days and dance with my top off - being over 50 it 's hard to dance around with your top off unless you 're in good shape			1
' i would say to other men , try and get in shape through exercise first , but if that does n't work then perhaps surgery is a better option			0
also , the amount it costs is a good incentive to keep it off			0
' staying in shape : @entity18 maintains his great shape with @entity114 boxing and weight training 4 - 5 times each week he said : ' i do get told i look very young for my age			1
i once got stopped at passport control as the officer did n't believe it was me , because of my age			0
' he also had a pec implant a few years ago and is keen to have more treatment on his lower abdomen next as he wants more definition there			0
and it seems that @entity18 is n't alone in his quest for more definition			2
the number of men above the age of 50 who have undergone the non-surgical alternative to liposuction at @entity47 of @entity138 has increased by more than 110 per cent in the past two years			0
now , almost 20 per cent of the total number of men who undergo @entity31 at the clinic are above the age of 50			2
confidence : he says he feels so much more confident with his new shape and loves taking his shirt off in @entity96 experts have put this increase down to a more open attitude to cosmetic surgery amongst men , together with the presence of older males in the public eye - from heads of industry and politicians to actors and musicians - who are today being photographed looking fit and well later in life			1
dr @entity48 , cosmetic doctor at @entity47 , who has performed more @entity31 treatments than any other practitioner in the @entity164 , said : ' some four - five years ago the average age of a patient who came to me expressing an interest in @entity31 was around 30 years old			2
at that time it was incredibly rare for men in their 50s and 60s to seek the treatment			0
' now a considerable proportion of the males i treat are 50 or older , which demonstrates a dramatic change in attitude towards cosmetic treatment			0
not alone : @entity18 is n't alone is his quest for greater abs , the @entity47 have been a 110 per cent surge in men seeking the treatment ' there are a number of reasons i would attribute to the rise in numbers			2
a lot of the men i treat have exercised regularly and maintained a healthy diet their whole lives in order to remain in shape			0
' when these men reach their mid fifties and their metabolism begins to slow , they struggle to maintain that physique but they are not prepared to give up the body that they desire			2
' i ’m also increasingly aware that captains of industry are taking a much greater interest in their general health , fitness and physical appearance			0
' the image of a senior male figure in business today is very different to what it was some 10 - 15 years ago			0
trim and toned : with age , @entity18 , who owns his own marketing company , could n't maintain his physique so this was perfect for him ' gone are the days where men can afford not to care about the way they look and their physical health and fitness			1
now these men are in the public eye and they care a great deal about looking and feeling fit and healthy beyond the age of fifty			0
' for these individuals , treatments like @entity31 can go hand in hand with regular exercise , to help ensure that they look and feel fitter and younger			2
' @entity31 is also far more suitable for these patients than traditional liposuction because it involves very little downtime , allowing the patient to get back to their day to day working routine almost immediately			2
