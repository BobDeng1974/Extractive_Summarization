fruit juices made from so - called superfoods such as cranberries and pomegranates often have more sugar than a can of cola , officials have warned			1
while the drinks are said to have health benefits , some brands contain more than a day ’s recommended intake of sugar in a single 300ml serving			1
the @entity14 , which represents councils that are responsible for public health , accused soft drink firms of ‘ dragging their heels ’ when it comes to minimising sugar in their products			1
@entity25 juice drink ( pictured left ) was found to have 11g of sugar per 100ml , which is more than the amount in a can of @entity31 ( right ) it said children under the age of ten get almost a fifth of their sugar intake from soft drinks			1

@entity25 juice drink was found to have 11g of sugar per 100ml , while @entity50 ’ had 12.1g			2
both exceed the 10.6g per 100ml in a can of @entity31 – but do not come close to the 15.1g per 100ml in @entity55			0
a 300ml serving of any of the four drinks would breach the 25g daily sugar limit recommended by the @entity59			1
juice businesses insisted the study is misleading because it does not differentiate between unhealthy added sugar – such as monosaccharides and disaccharides in fizzy drinks – and natural sugar found in fruit			2

and pomegranate juice has been linked to resistance to prostate cancer and heart disease			0

‘ we are calling on the sector as a whole to step up and show more corporate responsibility			0
’ a spokesman for @entity101 said cranberries are naturally low in sugar , so sweetening is required			2
@entity105 is promoted for its health benefits , but drinks contain four teaspoons of sugar per 330ml she added : ‘ we offer consumers a range of reduced sugar options including our @entity114 product ‘ we ’ve made and continue to maintain a firm commitment to low - sugar innovation , and through product formulation , price promotion and portion sizes we seek to offer the best choice in flavours , calories and formats			1
’ @entity124 , chief executive of @entity50 , accused the @entity14 of distributing misleading research			1
he said his product does not include refined sugar , which the @entity59 says is more harmful than naturally occurring fruit sugars			0
@entity50 instead includes pinitol , a natural compound which stops blood sugar levels rapidly rising			0
mr @entity124 said : ‘ to lump us in with big fizzy drinks companies is just misleading			0
‘ we are a small company competing with huge multinational businesses which are just chucking sugar into drinks because it is cheap			0
