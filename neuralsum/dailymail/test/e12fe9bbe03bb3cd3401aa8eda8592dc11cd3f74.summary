the long - term effects of this will be more and more in evidence over the coming years			2
' mrs @entity46 's comments follow those from string of former military servicemen who have hit out at the @entity5 over its continuing use of @entity9			2
general @entity51 told the paper it was ' extraordinary ' the @entity5 continued to prescribe @entity9 given the weight of evidence about its side effects , and urged it to use other anti-malaria medicines			1
