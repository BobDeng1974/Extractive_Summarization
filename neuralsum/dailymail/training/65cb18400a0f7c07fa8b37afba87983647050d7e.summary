using a microwave can be tricky			0
unless it 's a ready - meal , you 're forced to hazard a guess about cooking times			2
standing in front of the microwave and testing the temperature of a dish over and over can be tedious - and if it 's not piping hot in the middle the food can be a health hazard too			1
but now a solution is in sight			0
an inventor has designed a next generation microwave that uses infrared cameras to tell you when your food is irradiated to perfection			1
and it can also send information to your phone , so you can instruct your microwave to cook for longer remotely if needed			2
the @entity32 was created by former @entity34 engineer @entity33			0
for now the concept is only in a prototype stage , but people can register their interest at the website @entity40			0
in a video showing off the product , he laments the lack of innovation in the microwave since its invention almost 50 years ago			0
‘ [ the microwave ] has pretty much remained unchanged since its inception in 1967 , ’ he said			0
‘ and that ’s a shame , because there are quite a few sucky things about it			0
’ a @entity55 inventor has created a microwave that monitors food temperature ( shown )			1
it uses an infrared camera to display temperature data on a screen			1
the lcd screen on the front shows if your food is ready the microwave can automatically switch off when the food becomes white hot ( shown in animation )			1
it can also send the heat map to your phone so you can monitor your meal kitchen chain £ 34.99 @entity75 has devised a gadget that combines two cooking methods that have transformed family meal times and can deliver a tasty curry or chilli con carne in just 20 minutes			1
it is a pressure cooker that slides into a microwave and cooks everything from raw meat to jams , marmalades and steam puddings at incredibly high temperatures			0
the net effect is a super-fast cooking machine that could even replace the supermarket ready meal			2
he notes that , with current microwaves , it is difficult to know exactly when food is done			0
‘ basically , unless you stop the microwave and pull your food out to inspect it , there ’s no way to tell if it ’s done just right			0
’ his invention uses an infrared camera in the top of the microwave , and sends information to an lcd screen on the front of the microwave			1
here it displays a heat map that starts blue , because the food is cold , and transitions to white hot , when the food is hot			1
the microwave can also be programmed to turn off when the food it is cooking becomes all white in temperature			2
and via @entity120 or @entity121 , the heat map can be beamed to your phone , so you can display the same screen on there			1
from your phone you can then add another 30 seconds if the food does n’t look like it has cooked enough			2
the lcd screen can also be used to display recipes or play cooking videos			1
there 's no news yet , though , on when the innovative microwave might be released to the public , or how much it is likely to cost .			0
