by @entity0 published : 19:24 est , 28 january 2013 updated : 12:50 est , 29 january 2013 @entity1 , chief executive of @entity2 , admitted the target is to answer 80 per cent of calls in five minutes a private phone company is making hundreds of thousands of pounds in profit from @entity2 premium rate helplines			1
@entity2 chief @entity1 told a committee of @entity9 that @entity10 has made ' less than £ 1million ' from the 0845 number			1
yet , she said keeping millions of customers on hold for five minutes before they can speak to a tax official is ' acceptable ' and admitted the target is to answer 80 per cent of calls within five minutes			0
as @entity2 receives 80million telephone calls each year , this means 16million callers will be kept waiting for longer than this			1
miss @entity1 said @entity2 research showed customers believed such a wait was acceptable			1
she told @entity9 : ‘ if we can answer 90 per cent of the calls , which we have been doing for the last quarter , then we think people will wait up to five minutes			2
’ giving evidence to the @entity28 , miss @entity1 said : ‘ we think real people start counting the call from when they pick up the phone so we are going to measure that and we reckon that will mean that we will be achieving a call of about five minutes to six minutes			2
’ but @entity9 said a similar target in the private sector is to answer calls within 20 seconds			0
and @entity39 mp @entity38 , the chairman of the committee , criticised @entity2 for its ‘ lack of ambition ’ , describing the target as ‘ a disappointment ’			0
miss @entity1 ’s admission emerged after a damning report by the spending watchdog last month said taxpayers spent more than £ 30million last year waiting to speak to @entity2			1
a million letters from taxpayers lay unopened for weeks last year after a huge backlog of mail built up at @entity2 offices up and down the country , boss @entity1 admitted			1
during questioning by @entity9 , she said : ‘ we had one million pieces of post dotted about the organisation			0
once you get to that [ position ] , you are getting the chaser letter before you have unpacked the [ original ] letter			0
’ she insisted its backlog of post has improved , saying it had dropped to fewer than 100,0000 by @entity66			0
the report , by the @entity67 , said the treatment of customers – many of whom waste hours trying to get through - was ‘ unacceptable ’			0
mrs @entity1 said @entity2 did not take profits from the helplines , that can cost up to 41p a minute , but said they do receive some ' additional services ' from @entity10 , according @entity76			2
she refused to disclose how much the telecoms company makes in profit on the calls , telling mps the information was commercially sensitive			2
she said the company was moving to cheaper 03 numbers this year and said profits should therefore fall			0
last year , the average waiting time more than doubled from 107 seconds to 282 seconds , and the @entity67 said that between april and september , nearly 6.5million people waited longer than ten minutes , excluding the time spent listening to the automated greeting			2
the new five - minute target will include the time spent listening to the automated greeting			0
@entity2 has , however , revealed plans to scrap all its 0845 numbers – which cost up to 41p per minute from a mobile phone – by the end of the summer			1
@entity94 , director general of personal tax at @entity2 , said it will switch to telephone numbers which begin 03 , which cost the same as calling an 01 or 02 number			0
mrs @entity38 said @entity2 ’s use of 0845 numbers was unacceptable			1
@entity2 does not receive a share of the money from 0845 numbers , which goes to telecoms giant @entity10 .			1

company makes ' less than £ 1million ' profit from premium 0845 numbers
each year 16million callers will be kept waiting for longer than five minutes
@entity9 tell @entity2 chief @entity1 the wait is ' unacceptable '
