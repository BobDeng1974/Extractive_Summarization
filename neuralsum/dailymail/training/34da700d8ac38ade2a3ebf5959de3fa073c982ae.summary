by @entity0 @entity1 is planning to put some muscle behind its future @entity3 - literally			1
the @entity5 - based company yesterday published a patent application to use an ‘ artificial muscle system ’ for focusing cameras in devices such as its @entity10 and @entity12			1
the patent claims the system would contract in a similar way to how muscles move to focus the lens and take images			1
@entity1 yesterday published a patent application to use ‘ artificial muscle ’ for focusing cameras in devices such as its @entity10 and @entity12			1
the artificial muscle structure is pictured here			1
it is based on a class of ‘ smart material ’ that change shape when near an electric field			1
the contracting movement is similar to a real muscle the system could allow for much slimmer mobile systems that use less power while carrying larger camera components , the company said			1
@entity36 20140168799 , entitled ‘ @entity37 ’ , describes how the structure will be based on electroactive polymers ( @entity40 )			0
@entity41 , or artificial muscles , are a class of ‘ smart material ’ that deform in the presence of an electric field			1
the muscle that @entity1 has outlined would replace the comparatively large voice coil motor ( @entity49 ) currently used to focus mobile phones cameras			0
while it may sound like science - fiction , the idea to use artificial muscle is n’t new			2
the technology , for instance , is already being used in touch feedback in some video game controllers			0
the construction is built inside a metal frame and supported by springs			0
a circular electrode - @entity40 sits on top of the conical lens , with a hole that works as the camera 's aperture			2
the movement is produced when the lens is subjected to an electrical field whether @entity1 will use the @entity40 technology in the future @entity71 ( leaked image pictured ) remains unclear ‘ there have been suggestions to use artificial muscle technology for implementing a camera autofocus lens actuator , ’ @entity1 said in its application			1
however , the filing claims that @entity40 materials can now be ‘ engineered and developed to for high volume manufacture			2
’ @entity1 claims they have also tried to use @entity40 to create an autofocus lens , ‘ but a completely engineered solution for high volume manufacture or mass production may not be available			2
’ their solution involves placing @entity87 in a cone truncated shape , which is surrounded by negative electrodes on top , and positive electrodes on the bottom			0
@entity1 's solution involves placing @entity87 in a cone truncated shape , which is surrounded by negative electrodes on top , and positive electrodes on the bottom			0
in this layout , the ‘ artificial muscle ’ can use the electrical potential between negative and positive electrodes to move the lens up and down the @entity10 6 may be able to track altitude , weather and even air pressure , according to code found in the @entity106 operating system			1
the files suggest a built - in barometer could provide instant weather readings by forecasting changes in the air pressure			0
the barometer could also be useful for mountain climbers , runners or bikers , who want to keep track of their altitude while training			0
and as well as environmental readings , the new sensors would improve the accuracy and speed of the phone ’s location services			0
in this layout , the ‘ artificial muscle ’ could use the electrical potential between negative and positive electrodes to move the lens up and down			1
as well as this , a circular electrode - @entity40 sits on top of the lens , with a hole that works as the camera 's aperture , according to @entity133			2
@entity1 said this will not only reduce costs ‘ significantly ’ , but it will also ‘ exhibit extremely low power consumption			0
’ the assembly , they claim , also has the ability to support larger optical technologies			0
however , whether @entity1 will use the technology in the future @entity10 device remains unclear .			0

artificial muscle technology uses electroactive polymer ( @entity40 ) material
the @entity40 ' smart materials ' change shape when near an electrical field
patent claims this could be used to contract the lens up and down
eaps could help develop a much slimmer mobile that uses less power
they could also enable @entity12 and @entity3 to carry larger camera parts
