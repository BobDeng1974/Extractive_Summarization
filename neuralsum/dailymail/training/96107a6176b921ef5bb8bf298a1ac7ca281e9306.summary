colonel @entity0 , who led @entity2 forces in @entity3 , claimed allowing women into battle would ' put lives in danger ' women lack the ' killer instinct ' to serve in frontline combat operations , a retired @entity2 army commander has warned			1
colonel @entity0 , who led @entity2 forces in @entity3 , claimed allowing women into battle would ' put lives in danger '			1
ministers are expected to announce they are ready to lift the long - standing ban within weeks , but critics say it risks damaging the fighting capabilities of the armed forces			1
in may this year @entity21 , then the defence secretary , said it was time for the @entity24 to abandon the ' macho ' image and show they were open to everyone who was fit enough			0
he said the @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31 armies allowed women to serve in combat roles – and so should @entity2			2
he ordered a review into who can take combat roles , which is expected to report shortly			1
but mr @entity0 accused mr @entity21 – who is now foreign secretary – of pursuing a ' transparent political agenda '			1
writing in @entity38 , he said : ' prioritising political correctness and a misguided idea of equal opportunities can only serve to undermine fighting effectiveness and put lives in danger			1
' he said it was the machismo in the forces which mr @entity21 ' seems to despise so much ' which was needed when troops must make the decision to ' kill or be killed '			0
' @entity51 close combat demands ferocity , aggression and killer instinct			0

' even in the high - tech 21st century , 100 years after the outbreak of the @entity61 , the infantry soldier 's ultimate purpose is still to get out of a trench and charge into the teeth of enemy fire : to close with the enemy and kill him face to face with bullets , bayonets , grenades and if necessary in hand - to - hand combat			0
' he questioned how many women would take up the chance to transfer to frontline combat roles in the infantry			1
' physically and emotionally , few women will have the aptitude to join the combat arms and perhaps even fewer will want to do so , ' he added			0

however , they remain barred from all infantry battalions and @entity98 units – including @entity99 – and from tank regiments and other armoured units			0
theoretically , women would be allowed to join the @entity99 , such as the @entity103			0
but to do so they would be expected to pass the unit 's gruelling mental and physical selection process			0
the @entity107 stressed that the final review has not yet been completed			1
a spokesman said : ' the review process into women in combat roles is ongoing : no decisions have been made and so any suggestion to the contrary is inaccurate			2
as such , it would be wrong for the department to comment further at this stage			0
