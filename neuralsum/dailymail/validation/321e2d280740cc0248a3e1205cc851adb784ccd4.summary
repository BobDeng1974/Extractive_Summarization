a @entity1 man was hospitalized after he crashed his remote - controlled plane this morning			1
the unidentified man was flying the radio - controlled jet as part of the @entity6 in @entity7 in @entity8			1
it crashed into @entity10 near the runway at @entity12			1
the remote - controlled jet that crashed on friday in @entity7 , @entity1 , is ' similar to one of these in size ' the jet crashed into @entity10 at @entity12 during the @entity1 @entity6 this morning @entity17 stopped the man from going to @entity19 so he was was taken to @entity20 the man suffered non-life threatening injuries , but was severely burned during the crash , according to 10 news			1
when the aerial enthusiast 's three - foot , $ 20,000 plane crashed near him , some of its fuel sprayed out and caused the burns			2
@entity32 originally wanted to fly the injured man to @entity19 , but there was too much fog for the medical chopper to navigate			0
the man was taken to @entity7 instead			2
although the accident was originally reported as an actual plane crash , that notion was dispelled			2
the @entity1 @entity41 is not a competition , but more of a ' @entity43 , or @entity44 ' , according to its @entity46 page from last year			0
the page reads : ' @entity6 is one of the most exciting @entity50 events on the planet			0
' fj features the ultimate technology in airframe construction and power plant , and has the highest level of pilot proficiency of any radio control model aviation discipline			0
' the @entity1 @entity41 is not a competition , but more of a ' @entity43 , or @entity44 ' , according to @entity46 there were some initial reports that a plane had crashed , but @entity62 quickly cleared up the confusion although this mishap might seem out of the ordinary , it is more common than you might think			0
remote - controlled planes crash frequently enough that there is a webpage about it			2
the no. 1 cause of remote control plane crashes is pilot error , according to @entity75			1
according to the site : ' either the pilot is flying beyond his or her abilities , or flying a plane that 's too advanced or simply unsuitable for his / her level of experience			0
' or perhaps they make a genuine mistake because of , say , disorientation - even experienced rc pilots make the wrong stick movements sometimes ! ' equipment failure is another reason			0
in fact pilot error is commonly disguised as equipment failure ! ' flying surface or control surface failure can also be the guilty culprit in bringing down our planes , especially if the builder did a less than satisfactory job on the hinges ! ' prevention is better than cure , but sadly it takes a crash to figure out what went wrong and hopefully prevent it happening again in the future			1
