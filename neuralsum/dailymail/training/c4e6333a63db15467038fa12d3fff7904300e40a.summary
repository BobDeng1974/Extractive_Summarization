by @entity0 last updated at 11:09 am on 18th november 2011 not a single person has left the protest camp outside @entity4 since a legal eviction notice was served giving them 24 hours to quit , activists said			1
the @entity6 had told the protesters to move tents and equipment from the public highway by 6pm last night or face @entity12 action			1
but instead of packing up , protesters were discussing putting up @entity15 decorations as they prepare for a lengthy legal battle			2
you 've been served : a bailiff pins an eviction notice to a tent outside @entity4 time to leave : bailiffs acting for the @entity6 handed out eviction notices to the tents at the @entity25 site bailiffs had tied notes to some of the 200 tents pitched in the churchyard telling activists to leave or face @entity12 action			1
but protesters vowed to continue and a sign on one of the tents yesterday declared : ‘ @entity36 , no – we wo n’t go ! ’ the notice was issued a day after @entity39 police cleared the @entity41 camp in @entity42			1
but lawyers warn the situation is more complex here due to human rights laws and the eviction could drag on for months			1
@entity48 had halted earlier court action to hold talks with protesters			2
but policy chairman @entity52 said the negotiations went ‘ nowhere ’			2
@entity54 , for @entity55 , insisted earlier this week the eviction ‘ was not something we need to be remotely worried about ’			1
she added : ‘ it could take months			1
’ legal threat : the warning notice handed out to protesters the @entity64 told last month how thermal imaging cameras showed the camp virtually empty at night			1
even if the court action succeeds , the protest is likely be continue in the churchyard during the day as long as nobody pitches tents			0
@entity72 , head of public law at @entity74 , said the @entity75 would make evicting @entity77 protesters a far more complex affair			1
before deciding whether to give the go - ahead to the eviction , a judge would have to consider @entity82 , which covers freedom of expression , and @entity85 , freedom of assembly , he said			1
‘ any judgment would hinge on whether the interference with those rights is " proportionate "			0
deadline passed : the anti-capitalist protesters did have the option of leaving voluntarily - but not one person has gone home ‘ the protesters have in their favour that @entity4 ’s remains open and so there is not a massive amount of disruption to the normal use of the land			0
‘ @entity102 also needs to decide if is just trying to remove the camp , or to stop the protest altogether , which would be much more difficult			2
‘ it is likely that we could get a situation where , even after the removal of the tents , protests are allowed to continue outside @entity4 ’s during the day			0
’ he said there were likely to be similarities with the attempts to evict the protesters camped in @entity117 which began in may 2010 but only concluded ten months later in march this year			2
on patrol : police officers walk among protesters outside @entity4 on wednesday the anti-capitalist protest at the @entity4 is part of a series in cities across the globe which aim to highlight the inequalities caused by mismanagement of the economy			0
demonstrators have been camped outside @entity4 ’s since october 15 after an attempt to occupy the nearby @entity132 failed			0
the @entity6 halted earlier court action to hold talks with protest organisers aimed at finding a compromise that would allow the demonstrators to remain at the site until january if they removed some of the tents			0
after a humiliating internal row within the church which led to two high profile resignations , @entity4 decided not to join the legal action against the protesters			0
a spokeswoman for @entity4 ’s said earlier this week : ‘ we recognise the local authority ’s statutory right to proceed with the action			0
‘ we have always desired a peaceful resolution and the @entity152 will continue to hold regular meetings with representative of the protesters			0
