no gilet ; no problem for @entity2			0
make no bones about it , the @entity4 manager enjoyed this victory			1
beating the club who ruthlessly relieved him of his duties last summer , on their home patch , as his side took a giant step towards @entity16 survival — it does not get much better than that			1
he knew it , too , ecstatically saluting the @entity4 faithful with both fists clenched at the final whistle before shaking @entity24 ’s hand			2
@entity25 heads @entity4 into the lead against @entity27 in the 35th minute of the game @entity25 celebrates the goal that gave @entity2 's team the advantage at the end of the first half @entity25 continued his fine form for @entity4 from tuesday , where he scored a hat - trick in the 3 - 3 draw with @entity37 @entity25 ( second left ) is mobbed by his @entity4 team - mates after scoring the opening goal against @entity27 @entity25 points to the sky as he led the @entity4 attack against @entity27 in the @entity16 @entity27 : @entity42 ; @entity43 4.5 ( @entity44 79 ) , @entity45 6 , @entity46 6.5 , @entity47 6.5 , @entity48 6.5 , @entity49 6.5 ; @entity50 5.5 ( @entity51 79 ) , @entity52 6 , @entity53 5.5 ( @entity54 62 , 5 ) ; @entity55 6.5			1

all this without his trademark body - warmer on a mild day in north @entity97			0
‘ this is my most satisfying victory as a manager , because it ’s at such an important stage of the season and no - one gave us a chance , ’ said @entity2			0
‘ this week i ’ve had so many people tell me , “ you ca n’t win at @entity106 , @entity4 never win there ”			1
‘ i ’ve been in the pressure of a title race as a player , but this is worse			0
when you ’re a player you only think about yourself			0
as a manager you ’ve got the expectations of the whole club — and this is n’t a little club , it ’s massive			0
’ @entity4 manager @entity2 was visibly ecstatic at recording the win and getting three points upon the final whistle @entity121 ( centre ) of @entity4 reacts to missing a chance to get on the scoresheet against @entity27 @entity2 ( left ) greets @entity27 manager @entity24 before the start of the @entity16 encounter @entity4 midfield player @entity68 ( left ) takes the ball past @entity27 's @entity52 @entity49 ( left ) of @entity27 challenges @entity128 of @entity4 for possession in the first half @entity4 midfielder @entity67 was sent off for committing a second bookable offence in the final exchanges against @entity27 as for @entity27 , they can kiss the idea of @entity136 football goodbye after this lacklustre defeat			1
this display suggests they do not deserve a top - four finish			0
@entity46 , alongside @entity45 in central defence , was handed the unenviable task of taming @entity25 after @entity143 missed out through illness			2
the @entity147 striker ’s run of seven goals in five games had given @entity4 ’s survival hopes a shot in the arm			1
by the final whistle @entity46 was probably wishing @entity154 had taken a shot of something to cure his illness as the brilliant @entity25 fired @entity4 to victory			1
spurs carved out the first clear - cut chance in the 27th minute , @entity61 saving well after @entity55 had played in @entity160 down the left			1
that was as good as it got for @entity27 , though , as @entity25 ’s influence grew			1
crowd reaction all was going well until his exuberant celebrations at the final whistle , which prompted an angry reaction from the home fans in the @entity169 but he merely shook his fist at them and disappeared down the tunnel			0
got an easy ride during the game , though , and gave the @entity4 fans a wave after they asked for one in the 16th minute			1
@entity177 behaviour the spring weather allowed to him leave his gilet indoors so there were no flying jackets this time			0
he did not leave his seat until the eighth minute then remained standing for the most part			0
little more than a subtle fist pump when @entity25 scored the winner but his emotions poured out at the final whistle			2
told someone on the @entity27 bench to ‘ shut the f * * * up ’ as tempers flared in stoppage time			2
tactics @entity2 has shown once again that he knows how to get a striker scoring			0
@entity25 , who fronted a three - pronged attack , scored the winner before the manager set his side up perfectly to deal with the second - half @entity27 fightback , although it never seemed to come			1
verdict low - key return for @entity2 who nailed the game plan and left with three precious points			2
looks a different , more relaxed man , although he showed a glimpse of the old @entity2 at the final whistle			0
@entity4 striker @entity25 shoots at goal in an attempt to score his second goal of the game against @entity27 @entity50 ( centre ) of @entity27 takes the ball beyond @entity66 ( left ) as @entity4 captain @entity69 looks on @entity27 striker @entity55 ( right ) takes on @entity65 of @entity4 in an attempt to get his team back into the game @entity64 ( right ) a substitute for @entity4 , slides in against @entity55 and wins the ball @entity72 ( right ) jostles for possession of the ball alongside @entity27 defender @entity220 @entity50 ( centre ) leaps over a challenge from @entity66 as @entity27 battled against @entity4 @entity4 goalkeeper @entity61 ( centre ) leads the celebrations with the away supporters at the final whistle @entity70 should have been allowed to go one on one with @entity227 as he sprung @entity27 ’s offside trap , but he was wrongly flagged in the 31st minute			1
the decision sparked the first animated complaint from @entity2 , who had been unusually subdued to that point			0
four minutes later , @entity2 was back on his feet			0
not in anger this time , but in delight			0
if @entity4 preserve their top - flight status they will owe it to @entity25			1
they will also have @entity27 defender @entity220 — filling in at right back for the injured @entity239 — to thank			2
the @entity240 , who has been a peripheral figure for @entity24 , was having an uncomfortable afternoon , and the home fans were letting him know it , too			0
@entity244 ’s carelessness led to @entity4 ’s winner			2
after he sloppily conceded possession around 10 yards outside his area , the ball eventually fell to @entity121 , from whose cross @entity25 out - jumped @entity46 and directed his header past @entity42			2
@entity4 deserved their lead ; without being easy on the eye , there was an intensity to their game that @entity27 could not handle			1
and in first - half stoppage time they very nearly doubled their advantage			0
not for the first time , a long pass found @entity25 , whose header released @entity70 , who cut inside @entity45 before watching his low drive from the edge of the area hit the post			2
any faint hopes @entity24 still harboured of a top - four finish were fading fast			0
@entity27 did step up the tempo in the second half ; @entity47 and @entity55 both went close with speculative efforts			1
but if @entity25 was @entity4 ’s first - half hero , their central - defensive partnership of @entity65 and @entity64 took the honours after the break as @entity2 ’s men soaked up the pressure			1
@entity27 midfield player @entity48 ( left ) holds off @entity72 as he tries to get @entity27 back into the game @entity27 's temporary captain @entity55 ( left ) is closed down in possession of the ball by @entity128 @entity70 winces after getting a knock in @entity4 's game at @entity27 on saturday @entity24 made a double switch 11 minutes from time : @entity51 replaced @entity50 and @entity44 came on for his @entity27 debut in place of @entity244 , who departed to ironic applause			1
but it was @entity4 who missed two glorious chances to wrap up victory , @entity65 and @entity69 spurning gilt - edged opportunities in the closing stages			2
to add to @entity2 ’s anxiety , @entity4 had to play the final few minutes with 10 men after @entity67 picked up a second yellow card for a late challenge on @entity47			1
the match descended into farce as both teams were involved in a melee just before the final whistle			0
soon afterwards , though , @entity302 and @entity4 erupted .			2

@entity25 headed @entity4 into the lead in the 35th minute against @entity27 at @entity106
@entity27 had @entity55 as captain for the second *consecutive* @entity16 game
@entity4 held on for three points to considerably boost their survival hopes but @entity67 was sent off
