@entity7 , who also works as an actress , had the procedure for her ' mallet toe deformity , ' which meant her second and third toes were a lot longer than they should be , jurors were told			1
the 38 - year - old allegedly gave the @entity14 and @entity15 the fake name @entity17 and claimed her father , then her uncle would settle the bill with credit cards over the phone			1
it was not until six days later that the clinic realised the cards , belonging to two women and one man , were stolen when it was contacted by the bank , @entity23 heard			1
on trial : @entity7 , pictured modelling ( left ) and outside @entity23 ( right ) , where she stands accused of using stolen credit card details to pay for surgery to correct her ' excessively long toes ' @entity7 , of @entity33 , @entity34 , was arrested last june			1
she denied the offence claiming she had given the cash to a friend who worked at the clinic who could get her a discount price but only if they paid for the procedure themselves			0
she was charged with fraud and conspiracy to commit fraud two months later			1
opening the case today , prosecutor @entity46 said : ' this is a strange case of fraud because of the nature of what it was the prosecution say was obtained by fraud			0
' it was not goods from a shop or supermarket , it was a service , and the service was a surgical procedure on the defendant ’s feet			0
' and this case is about how that was paid for , or rather as the prosecution would advance not paid for			0
' what happened was a lady calling herself @entity17 , who is the defendant @entity7 , called the clinic to make an appointment regarding surgery			1
' she saw a surgeon who noted she had excessively long second and third toes on each foot and surgery was booked in for what was described as mallet toe deformity			0
' alleged scam : it was not until six days later that the clinic realised the cards , belonging to two women and one man , were stolen when it was contacted by the bank , @entity23 ( above ) heard the court heard @entity7 was supposed to pay £ 120 for the consultation but she told them her father would pay later as she had no money at the time , giving his name as @entity86 who lived in @entity87			1
her surgery was booked in for may 9 but when the clinic had still not been paid upfront the day before the surgery they called @entity7 who told them her uncle would now be paying , it is alleged			1
the court heard a man then called the central @entity99 clinic on and tried to pay using three different credit cards , which were all declined			1
but the payment went through on another three cards and @entity7 had the surgery at a @entity104 hospital in @entity99 ’s @entity105			2
‘ over the telephone , he provided the details of three different cards all of which were tried to facilitate the necessary payment all of which were declined , ’ mr @entity46 continued			2
‘ then finally two cards were accepted , and a £ 2,000 and a £ 1,000 payment was made on the first , and a £ 2,000 payment on the second			0
prosecutor @entity46 ‘ the payment seemed to go through okay			0
’ on may 10 , she attended the surgery at the @entity120 , @entity105 , central @entity99 and underwent the £ 5,000 surgery			0
but six days later credit card company @entity122 contacted the company to tell them the payment would n’t go through because the cards were being investigated for fraud			2
when the details of the cards provided by @entity7 ’s ‘ uncle ’ were checked , they were traced to the accounts of @entity122 customers @entity132 and @entity134 , the court heard			2
the scam resulted in a £ 5,000 loss to the clinic			0
she voluntarily attended a police station on june 14 and told officers she was ‘ not aware of any problems with payment or knowledge or involvement of fraud of any kind			0
’ @entity7 , who states she is a model , actress and business owner of hair extensions company @entity150 online , denies the charges between april 30 and may 11 last year			2
sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
