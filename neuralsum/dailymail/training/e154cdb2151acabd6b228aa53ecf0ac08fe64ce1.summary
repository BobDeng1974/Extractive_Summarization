by @entity0 published : 10:41 est , 4 july 2013 updated : 10:41 est , 4 july 2013 our ancestors used a network of small caves for occasional hunting expeditions before returning to a larger base , which they called home , new excavations have found neanderthals were a house - proud race who liked to return to a comfortable home after a long day of hunting , excavations of caves in @entity12 have revealed			1
the new research found that our ancestors used a network of small caves for occasional hunting expeditions before returning to a larger base , which they called home			1
scientists from @entity25 and @entity12 museum worked together on the dig. they unearthed stone tools and camp fires featuring the remains of seals , ibex and red deer , dating back more than 24,000 years			1
by analysing the artefacts and the density in which they were found in each cave , a team of scientists was able to determine which site was used for what purpose			2
among the tools found were hammers , scrapers and shucks for opening shellfish , another staple of the @entity13 diet			0
the population would have foraged locally along a coastal plain , eating a varied diet including wild boar , rabbits , dolphins , birds , tortoises , fish and pine nuts			0
@entity12 was inhabited by @entity13 for 100,000 years , with radiocarbon dating suggesting they lived on the @entity60 possibly as recently as 24,000 years ago			1
the peninsula was the final stronghold of the early descendants of man and is where one of the first discoveries of @entity13 skeletal remains was made in the 19th century			0
@entity68 , the largest of those excavated by the scientists from @entity71 and @entity25 , was also once home to hyenas			2
an artist 's drawing of a 30,000 - year - old hyena den. archeologists found hammers , scrapers and shucks for opening shellfish at @entity68 in @entity12 but did not find large bones , indicating that our ancestors were good at housekeeping ' @entity68 has a denser , more continuous sequence of lithic artefacts , with greater organic content in its sediments , corroborating the notion that the cave was more heavily utilised , ' according to the paper published in the @entity92 journal			2
' the paucity of large vertebrate remains from @entity68 has been interpreted to be a consequence of housekeeping , thus implying longer - term occupation			1
' @entity68 is the largest of the four caves , and its high ceiling and exposure to sunlight make it the most suitable for habitation			0
scientists are excited about their findings at @entity68			0
@entity12 was inhabited by @entity13 for 100,000 years , with radiocarbon dating suggesting they lived on the @entity60 possibly as recently as 24,000 years ago the paper said : ' the dichotomy in occupation intensity between @entity111 's and the other caves , suggests the southern @entity113 @entity13 may have practised a mobility pattern in which hominins would temporarily occupy various sites during the course of foraging , but would regularly return to a particular hub locality , such as @entity111 's			1
' excavations in @entity121 - a sister to @entity68 - show climatic evidence of alternating periods of drought and heavy rainfall , according to @entity127			2
the annual excavation of @entity68 begins next week			0
further finds could add to the call for a @entity13 theme park , which would tell the story of our ancestors ' way of life .			0

our ancestors used a network of small caves for occasional hunting expeditions before returning to a larger base , which they called home
scientists from @entity25 discovered stone tools and meal left - overs from over 24,000 years ago
by analysing them they discovered how different caves were used
scientists think the *scarcity* of large vertebrate remains from @entity157 show our ancestors were pretty handy at housekeeping
