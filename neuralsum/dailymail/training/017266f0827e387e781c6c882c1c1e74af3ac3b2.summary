by @entity0 published : 10:30 est , 10 november 2013 updated : 14:30 est , 10 november 2013 a hero of the @entity3 mall siege , who was shot twice in the back , says the mental scars of the atrocity are harder to recover from than the physical ones			1
safari guard @entity9 , 49 , originally from @entity10 , shielded a four - year - old boy under a car in september 's terror attack in the @entity15 shopping centre			1
the father - of - two , who was shot while his wife , @entity17 , watched from underneath another car , said he still struggles with the memories of the massacre , in which 72 people died			1
safari guard @entity9 ( pictured in hospital ) was shot twice in the back in the @entity3 terror attack but he says the mental scars are taking longer to heal than the physical wounds mr @entity9 , who runs a safari guide business in @entity28 , said : ' my wife and i feel safer in the bush among the crocodiles and lions than in a shopping centre with humans now - it 's going to take us a while to recover			1
' i still have a wound in my chest where the bullet exited but apart from that my body has healed			2
' the physical stuff is fine			1
it 's the mental stuff that gets you in the dark of the night			1
' mr and mrs @entity47 had returned from guiding a safari tour days before the september 21 attack			1
they were going to the cinema in the shopping centre when members of the @entity55 terror group struck			1
speaking from the @entity28 coast where he is recovering with his family , mr @entity9 said : ' in a funny way it 's brought my wife and i closer together			1
' it sounds terrible and something you would n't wish on your worst enemy , let alone your family - but because we both experienced that horrific day we know exactly what each other is going through and can pick each other up in the bad times			2
mr @entity9 said he and wife , @entity17 , feel safer in the @entity28 bush that in a shopping centre with other people ' we 've shared this and ultimately came out the other side alive			1
' he and his wife parked on the rooftop and went into the mall when they heard gunfire			1
he said : ' at first we thought it was a robbery gone wrong but when we heard grenades going off we knew it was terrorists and probably @entity55			2
' the @entity89 terror group have made a number of attacks on neighbouring @entity28 in recent years			2
' my wife and i feel safer in the bush among the crocodiles and lions than in a shopping centre with humans now - it 's going to take us a while to recover , ' @entity9 mr @entity9 said : ' our intention was to make our way on foot down the car park ramp that led out of the building but , as we did , we could see two terrorists coming up shouting and shooting			1
' we then ran over to the opposite end of the car park where a cookery class had been taking place earlier			2
all the adults and kids who had been there were scattered about hiding			2
' we got under two cars parked next to each other			2
the terrorist pair began shouting how @entity28 had killed @entity89 women and children and they were here to kill all @entity121 and @entity28 in revenge			2
only @entity123 would be spared			2
' some people said they were @entity123 and they were let go			2
then the terrorists started shooting the rest			0
' it was n't like in the movies where the baddies indiscriminately spray round after round of bullets			0
' this was very deliberate targeting			0
you 'd hear a shot and then a few seconds later perhaps another two being fired			1
mr @entity9 and his wife hid under a car during the attack and shielded a four - year - old boy from terrorists ' from my position i could see people 's legs as they ran away			1
i 'd hear a shot and then they 'd topple over on the ground dead			1
' it was very strange - things going fast and slow at the same time			0
' the couple stayed frozen to their position under the cars as the terrorists went on the rampage on the rooftop			0
after 10 minutes the terrorist pair lobbed a grenade towards hostages near @entity9 and mrs @entity47			1
he was hit in the leg by shrapnel			0
' i did n't scream for fear of giving away our position , and was surprisingly calm , ' he said			0
' i thought " it 's not hit my head or heart " so i 'll survive and worry about it later			0
' it was in the ensuing panic after the grenade attack that mr @entity9 saw a young boy fleeing with a woman			1
' my wife and i started mouthing to them to get under the car with us , which they did			1
i do n't know what would have happened to them otherwise			0
' i protected the boy under the car but soon afterwards i was spotted			0
' unfortunately , as one of the terrorists bent over to pick up ammunition he had dropped , he spotted him hiding			0
a total of 72 people died in the @entity55 attack on the @entity192 in @entity3 in september ' it was lucky it was just me he saw but , as he stood up , he must have signalled to his accomplice who fired into the car - shooting me twice in the back , with one bullet also going through my arm as well			1
' they either must have thought i was dead or it was too much hassle to bend down to make sure because they left me alone after that			0
' i guessed the bullets had n't gone through my lungs or spine so it was n't going to kill me immediately			0
' for the next two and a half hours the couple and the four - year - old boy and others who had joined them , cowered as the terrorists returned intermittently			0
mr @entity9 said : ' it was very eerie			1
you could hear all the normal sounds of shopping malls - the whirl of ventilation units , the background music from restaurants and then gunfire			1
' eventually , private security forces - the real heroes - managed to secure the rooftop and start getting people out			0
the first wave of rescues were for people who could walk			0
' my wife refused to leave me and we were rescued 15 minutes later when they managed to get an ambulance up the ramp			2
' we were taken to the nearest hospital where i was operated on			0
' later the doctors told me i was only 10 minutes from death and had suffered near fatal blood loss and internal injuries			0
mr @entity9 was rescued by police and private security forces , who he said were the ' real heroes ' ' but the adrenaline coursing through my body meant i had no idea what was going on and how close to death i was			1
' after 10 days in hospital , he was discharged and , alongside his wife , is taking part in intensive counselling sessions to deal with post-traumatic stress disorder from their ordeal			2
mr @entity9 said : ' i want my story to be positive - we are here and lucky to be alive			1
' in some ways it 's been harder for @entity17 because although she 's not had the physical wounds she 's had the mental ones , which are harder			1
' my children , who are both at boarding school in @entity266 , took it badly			0
' my son @entity268 , 18 , was very angry about it all and my daughter @entity270 , 17 , has had some terrible nightmares			0
' but these terrorists ' ultimate aim is to divide us along religious grounds			0
we ca n't let that happen			0
' the little boy who was so strong throughout the whole thing got away safely in the first wave of rescues , but i 've been unable to track him down since			0
' it would be great to see him again to tell him how brave he was			0
' stories like him surviving are the ones to take from this experience - not the tales of murder			0
