brave : aid worker @entity1 , from @entity3 , @entity4 , who infiltrated the @entity6 and lived to tell the tale a @entity9 man may be the first @entity10 civilian to infiltrate a @entity6 training camp and escape to tell the tale			1
@entity13 from @entity3 , @entity4 , posed as a disillusioned @entity14 with a deep hatred of the @entity16 to join @entity6 fighters in lawless @entity18 , north - west @entity19			1
if his cover had been blown , @entity13 - who has not military experience and who went in with no back up or escape plan - believes he would have been immediately murdered or taken hostage			1
but he earned their trust and returned alive after an experience that was , he said , ' terrifying ' in an environment that ' glamorised and normalised violence '			1
after returning to @entity31 has reported his experience to police and he has debriefed counter-terrorism officers with a description of what he encountered			1
speaking for the first time about his extraordinary mission he said : ' since 9/11 , i became increasingly concerned about the threat of terrorism and , more specifically , about the risk of my own family - and other innocent @entity9 youngsters - being brainwashed by these extremists through clever internet marketing			2
' having harboured this fear for many years , my chance came to do something about it when i travelled to @entity19 on an aid mission			1
' i knew that this was my best chance to understand how these terror organisations operate and , armed with that knowledge , i wanted to prevent my own family , their friends and many other vulnerable @entity9 @entity14 and @entity58 from falling prey to these beasts			2
' having made some surreptitious enquiries , i met a @entity6 fixer who , for a fee , escorted me to the training camp			2
what i learnt , and what i saw , filled me with dread			2
the place was far from a holiday camp , but i could see its appeal and excitement from a teenager ’s point of view			2
' it glamorised and normalised violence - it managed to make it appear acceptable			2
' the fundamentalist @entity78 @entity6 emerged in the early 1990s in northern @entity19 in the chaos and internecine warfare following the withdrawal of @entity83 troops from @entity84			1
starting with fewer than 50 armed madrassah students , the movement spread throughout @entity84 by taking on corrupt warlords and cracking down on the widespread practice of ' bacha bazi ' , a form of child sex slavery			2
it ruled the country as the @entity93 of @entity84 from september 1996 until december 2001 , with @entity94 as the capital , until the @entity97 - led invasion in 2001			2
now it leads the resistance to the occupation			2
' there is nothing , absolutely nothing , which prepares you for the @entity6 ’s brutality , ' mr @entity13 said			1
he said : ' to protect themselves and the camp , fighters sleep in shifts with at least three men on armed sentry duty at all times			2
' if the others are n't sleeping , they will practice operations at night where drones ca n't see them from above			2
' at 4am , or sunrise , morning prayers will start			2
for security reasons , such as in the event of an ambush , camp members will pray on a rota system			2
' prayers last for about 15 minutes and will include a reading from the @entity132			2
only after prayers do the occupants come together and eat breakfast in a communal space			0
' at 5am , once breakfast has finished , the camp will plan the day 's operations			0
there did n't seem to be a strict formula for the day 's activities			0
men would be told what to do in the morning			0
' the camp generally seemed to separate in small groups , though			0
some may undertake reconnaissance work , others will sit around cleaning weapons and waiting for orders			1
' if members of the camp do head off from camp , they are under instructions to remain relatively close for safety reasons - usually a maximum of 30 minutes ' walk			0
' at around 8am , and if the men are in camp , they will pray again			0
' @entity6 camps are n't generally permanent , so if the group decides to move on they will do so now			0
they do n't generally move far , but will do so under heavy armed guard			0
' interestingly , some of the men will go back to their villages to check on their families and children			0
' if the camp is n't moving on , they will eat in shifts at around midday			0
' like with everything , cooking is done on a rota basis ; if people are n't cooking or out on patrol , they 'll be sleeping			0
' at 3pm there are generally more prayers , and again at 6pm following an evening meal			0
in the evening , most of the camp will be on high alert from the @entity19 military			1
' those left in the camp overnight will say their final prayers at around 9pm before sleeping in rota patterns			0
' mr @entity13 witnessed the @entity6 's brutality when he visited @entity19 on a four - week - long aid mission with @entity189 in 2012			1
during his mission to distribute hygiene packs , he visited orphanages and madrassas across the @entity194 and northern @entity19 , where he claims he witnessed clerics and elders beating and abusing young children			1
he witnessed kids as young as four receive vicious beatings - often for minor offences such as looking the wrong way , failing to recite a passage in the @entity132 correctly , or for talking during prayers			0
the beatings ranged in severity from slaps to ' full - blown ' attacks with bats , sticks or metal poles			0
it was not uncommon for children aged between four and 16 to suffer from broken bones , he said			0
' they justified these beatings by claiming that the children were not being " proper " muslims and that they had to be taught a lesson , ' said @entity13			1
' this is a culture where forced education and corporal punishment go hand - in - hand			0
' it 's a culture where children are made to fear their elders , and @entity78 generally , from a very , very young age			0
' nevertheless orphanages were recruiting grounds for the terrorists , who took advantage of the youngsters ’ vulnerability and desire to find a family environment			0
it was in the @entity19 city of @entity236 , in the @entity237 , where @entity13 decided to learn more about the @entity6 and attempt to infiltrate their ranks			1
he drove north to an area known for its strong links with the @entity6 , where he ' put the word out ' among local sympathisers			0
within a few days , a deal was cut with a tribal elder who arranged for @entity13 to meet a ‘ fixer ’ , a former @entity247 soldier called @entity248 , in the dangerous @entity249 of @entity18			1
@entity248 , who was carrying a pistol , escorted mr @entity13 to a @entity6 settlement where he was grilled by an armed leader about his intentions			1
' i was questioned for 45 minutes under the watchful eye of his guards - and i was terrified , ' said mr @entity13			1
' he said the @entity6 needed money , so i told them that i could arrange this for them in the @entity9			0
this seemed to do the trick - it was the " in " i needed			0
' he was asked to return the following day , and was taken back to the camp in a 4x4 packed with armed insurgents			1
' this was the only time that i genuinely believed that i may be killed - that i was being whisked away into the middle of the mountains for some heinous purpose , ' said @entity13			1
but to his surprise , he was welcomed ' with open arms ' and went on to meet many of the camp ’s members			1
he also caught a glimpse of their weapons cache - a tent packed with bags of pistols , kalashnikov assault rifles , and ammunition			0
one of the leaders told him that the camp was ' doing well ' and that it was training seven or eight @entity9 men from @entity284			0
scary : @entity6 militants brandish their weapons in this file picture taken in @entity94 in 2001 mr @entity13 was later offered full training at the ' academy ' in exchange for £ 1,000			1
this , he was told , would be used to fund training facilities and to buy bomb - making components			0
feigning interest , he left after two days on the pretence of getting the cash - but never returned			1
he said : ' it was incredible to think that i managed to meet - and be invited to join - the @entity6 within just seven days			1
' if i was able to accomplish this on a whim and without any prior research , it is no surprise that @entity9 youngsters are being recruited by the @entity6 , @entity305 and others			0
' mr @entity13 said the experience will help him to protect his own children from joining homegrown terror cells , or from becoming ‘ lone wolfs ’			1
he decided to write a fictionalised account of his experiences in a bid to engage with more people and provide insight into the ' terrorist mind - set and machinery '			1
the book - @entity319 , @entity320 & @entity321 : they @entity323 - published by @entity324 , is now on sale in print and @entity328 format			1
mr @entity13 chose not to publish the book , written as a thriller , under a pseudonym			1
' as a @entity14 myself i am not in any way criticising @entity78 , a religion i hold dear to my heart , ' he said			0
' i have had my manuscript read by many @entity78 scholars and clerics from around the world and i have been assured my book does not contain anything blasphemous , insulting or derogatory about any religion or faith including @entity78			1
' i criticise only the tiny proportion of @entity14 who continue to use the name of @entity78 in vain and for their own political or militarist purposes			0

@entity13 was in @entity19 doing aid work when he decided to join *jihadis*
they welcomed him with open arms and asked for £ 1,000 to train him up
he escaped after pretending he had to go and get the cash to *pay* them
now mr @entity13 has *dramatised* his experiences in a *semi-fictional* book
