owner @entity1 's ' vision and courage ' to move @entity3 to @entity4 can spur the club back to ' the forefront of @entity8 rugby ' , according to chief executive @entity9			1
@entity10 businessman @entity1 has been a private figure since his april 2013 takeover saved @entity3 from bankruptcy , preferring to dodge the limelight despite his rescue act			1
@entity1 founded @entity10 's first online insurance broker , 123.ie , and was reported to have received almost Â£ 30million in the 2010 sale to @entity18			1
@entity3 players celebrate during the @entity21 match against @entity22 last week the @entity24 native has helped revive @entity3 ' fortunes , with the club hosting @entity27 at their new @entity29 home in saturday 's pivotal @entity21 clash			2
chief executive @entity9 believes @entity1 's stewardship can now help restore the two - time @entity33 winners to their ' rightful place ' at the pinnacle of @entity8 rugby			1
' he 's a very modest , private individual , very engaging and personable in person but does n't want to attract a huge amount of attention , ' @entity9 told @entity40 of @entity1			1
' clearly he had a real vision for the club , wanted to return the club to its rightful place in the forefront of domestic and @entity8 rugby			2
' he 's very much had the view that rugby 's a fairly traditional sport , but where we were as a club we needed to break the mould somewhat			0
' if you keep doing the same things you keep getting the same results , and obviously the club was in significant financial issues , so to change that around we had to do something pretty radical			0
' we did n't move to @entity4 because of that , but once we 'd evaluated all the options this became head and shoulders above all else as the best possible option for the club			1
' and @entity1 had the vision and the courage to make the best decision on behalf of the club			1
' @entity3 launched their move to @entity4 from @entity72 in december with a record @entity74 crowd for their clash with @entity77			1
@entity3 beat the @entity22 23 - 3 in the @entity8 competition at the @entity79 last weekend a crowd nearing 25,000 is expected to flock to the stadium for @entity27 's visit , with @entity21 quarter - final qualification on the line			2
wasps are closing in on securing a site for a new @entity4 training ground the club hopes to have operational by 2016			2
@entity9 believes @entity72 - based @entity1 has always viewed @entity3 as much an engaging business challenge as a labour of love			1
while @entity3 ' committed figurehead may have a @entity24 background , @entity9 said there will be no split loyalties this weekend			1
' it 's hearts as much as minds , it 's obviously a huge emotional love of rugby , and the @entity3 club , " said @entity9			1
' and there 's a challenge there , a business challenge too , in doing something difficult			0
' the nature of men of this ilk , extraordinary people in their own right , they see opportunity where everyone else sees problems			0
' they see challenges as obstacles to be knocked over and not get in the way			0
' and they find something they ca n't resist			0
' i keep joking he 's going to have a double - sided tie with black and gold stripes on one side and blue on the other and he 'll flip it over depending on the result			0
' he 's through and through @entity3 now			2
' put it another way , we were all cheering on @entity134 last weekend ! ' native allegiances have been overtaken by club loyalty , so there wo n't be any mixed feelings			0
' rugby director @entity139 famously had to dig into his own pocket for medical supplies at the peak of @entity3 ' financial woes , as staff feared for their next paycheques			2
@entity139 famously had to dig into his own pocket for medical supplies at the peak of @entity3 ' financial woes @entity9 vowed the former @entity148 prop can now finally focus solely on rugby matters			1
' we 're probably not even at the end of the beginning ; i suppose that will be the end of the season , " said @entity9			0
' and that 's probably when the hard work really starts			0
' @entity139 's been an immensely important part of the club for the last two or three years , he 's stuck through it when times were difficult			0
' and now he can probably concentrate pretty much exclusively on the rugby and get us to where we all want to be which is back competing for silverware			0
