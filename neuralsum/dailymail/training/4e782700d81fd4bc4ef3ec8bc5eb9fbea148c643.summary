wearing a @entity104 sweatshirt , he took a break from his house decorating job in nearby @entity107 to claim he has ‘ no choice ’ but to live in the camp			2
it is already at the centre of a row as many residents in nearby @entity36 view the shacks as a ‘ filthy slum ’ where migrants cook on open fires , wash in the canal and use the woods as a toilet			1
yesterday the @entity121 was invited to tour the site by 30 - year - old @entity123 gipsy @entity94 , who revealed how up to six migrants sleep in a room on bare mattresses and sit outside among makeshift tables , armchairs and abandoned shopping trolleys			1

mr @entity94 entered @entity20 six months ago by car after showing his @entity42 identity card to border officials			1

but the camp remains , and locals are angry that more has not been done to move them on			0
@entity182 said : ‘ it ’s a joke , nobody wants to live near a filthy slum			0
’ @entity187 secretary @entity186 added : ‘ it stinks to high heaven and you can see garbage hanging in the trees and bushes			1

one angler said two swans and their dozen signets have disappeared from the river since the migrants ' arrival @entity216 secretary @entity186 said it ' stinks to high - heaven ' and looks like ' a shanty town in @entity8 or @entity7 ' washing lines have been installed in the area , while garbage , clothes and plastic bags hang from the trees			1
there is no running water or electricity on site those who have set up the camp have created a makeshift living room , using an arm chair and a pouffe as a coffee table two trolleys are pictured on site , one filled with rubbish			1

this is not the way we live , it ’s inhumane and unhealthy			0
’ at least one local said the migrants ‘ seem to keep their area quite clean ’			2
however , @entity265 police claim there is evidence that members of the public have been harassed and intimidated by the men , who occupy three separate camp areas			2
detective chief inspector @entity272 said anti-social behaviour is a ‘ significant and persistent problem ’ on the site			0
