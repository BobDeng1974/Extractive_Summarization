by @entity0 published : 14:39 est , 8 november 2013 updated : 14:44 est , 8 november 2013 brutally beaten : @entity1 , 36 , as seen when he was placed into jail following his arrest an @entity5 police department has placed multiple officers on leave after video of them beating a drunk driving suspect surfaced this week			1
four officers with the @entity11 ( ok ) @entity12 have been suspended with pay while investigators work to determine why an @entity16 dashcam showed two cops holding down and kicking @entity1 , 36 , in the head during a may traffic stop			1
officers @entity21 and @entity23 , as well as two other unnamed police have been placed on leave , the @entity20 originally reported			1
@entity26 footage shows the @entity16 cruiser speed up to catch mr @entity1 , who initially refuses to get out of his truck while two officers bark commands at him , this despite the official police report written by ms @entity21 saying he ‘ immediately ’ exited the truck			1
‘ you 're going to see where she says the driver immediately got out of his truck , ’ @entity36 , mr @entity1 ’s attorney told @entity37			0
‘ he never gets out of his truck			0
’ the report says mr @entity1 exited the truck , then got back in and asked ‘ what the f * * k did i do ? ’ but the video shows an entirely different scene			2
mr @entity1 is sitting in his truck while two officers talk to him			2
soon , a state trooper , identified in the report as @entity50 , is shown pulling the driver out by his neck and pinning him to the ground			0
the report says that ‘ @entity54 then pulled @entity1 from the truck and we placed him on the ground using a straight arm bar technique			0
another officer rushes in from the right side and appears to kick mr @entity1 in the head before falling onto and helping restrain him			2
the report says simply that ‘ officer @entity23 then arrived on the scene and assisted me in getting control of @entity1			1
’ ‘ the other @entity11 police officer comes from back over here , and this is when he comes running and kicks mr. @entity1 right in the face and you see his head snap back pretty good , ’ the attorney explained to @entity37			1
pictures of mr @entity1 at the time he was admitted to jail showed multiple wounds to his face , as well as blood			2
another attorney for mr @entity1 told @entity91 he suffered broken teeth , a bloody lip , bumps , bruises and scrapes all over his face			2
not a threat : mr @entity1 is shown sitting in his truck and never exiting , in stark contrast to the affidavit choke - slam : an officer can be seen throwing mr @entity1 to the ground by his neck already restrained : this image shown , shortly before mr @entity1 was kicked in the head , does not indicate further restraint was required the arrest report says mr @entity1 ‘ received a scratch on his left cheek and a bump above his left eye			1
