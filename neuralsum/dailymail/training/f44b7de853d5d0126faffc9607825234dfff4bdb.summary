it was like a scene out of @entity2			0
the moment plane spotters got more than they bargained for when a low - flying fighter jet missed their heads by a few feet has been caught on video			1
spectators at the @entity9 on saturday in @entity10 had their cameras at the ready when the @entity12 came into land following a display			2
however , the @entity16 air force jet came in to land lower than anticipated - sending the crowds running for cover			1
standing on and around a fence at the edge of a road , people throw themselves to the ground as the jet soars past , landing on a nearby runway			0
however , in the dramatic footage , many can be seen holding cameras and mobile phones in a bid to capture footage of the jet as it thunders above their heads			0
one man says : ' that was a bit close , was n't it ' as the roar of the aircraft can be heard			0
coming into land ! the fighter jet can be seen just feet above the heads of spectators at the @entity42 that was close ! the fighter jet soars above the plane spotters as it comes in to land at a nearby runway			1

the @entity16 air force jet came in lower than spectators expected
can be heard thundering above plane spotters ' heads as it comes in to land
