@entity0 wants to end his @entity2 career lifting @entity4 silverware at the ground he will call home next season			1
the final of the @entity9 is now tantalisingly within reach for @entity12 ’ side after their heroic quarter - final triumph over @entity15			2
only @entity16 stand in their way in what will be a tough semi-final at @entity20 in a fortnight			0
should the @entity22 prevail , they will head for @entity24 - home of @entity25 for whom winger @entity0 signed a two - year deal this month			1
@entity0 was a key player in @entity2 's dramatic win over @entity15 at the @entity29 ‘ @entity24 is going to be my future home ground and it would be great to get to know it by playing a final there , ’ he said			1
‘ for that to be one of my final games for @entity2 and to pick up silverware would make things pretty special , really emotional and a great end to my time at the club			1
‘ helping @entity2 bring the first major trophy back home would be the perfect way to give back something to the club , to repay them for all they have done through the years , all the good friends i have made , all the good memories			2
’ @entity51 cap @entity0 was one of @entity2 ’s key men in the dramatic win at the @entity29			1
he played a crucial role in a mighty rearguard action when he joined the scrum as a flanker following the sin - binning of prop @entity59			0
@entity60 is hopeful he can end his @entity2 career at the ground he will call home from next season and it is the strength of character shown in those closing minutes that has convinced him the season will end with silverware and a top - six spot in the @entity71			2
‘ that was an unbelievable win and you ca n’t under - estimate its significance , ’ he said			0
‘ i was at the scrum in the end and the way @entity79 ( @entity78 ) held up their player when he went over the line in that final minute showed the desire we had to come away with a win			2
‘ the way we defended in those final moments shows the fight of the boys to get underneath the ball at the end and keep them out			0
@entity2 will have to see off @entity16 if they are to reach the final at the @entity24 ‘ the @entity2 of old would have probably let that through and we would have lost			1
‘ we work hard for each other			0
that is exactly what you saw at the end of the game			0
our aim is to finish in the top six and to lift the @entity9			0

@entity0 has *agreed* to join @entity25 next season
@entity2 one win away from @entity9 final at the @entity24
and @entity0 wants to crown his time with the club before he leaves
