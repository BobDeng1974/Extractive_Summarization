a startling video has emerged showing @entity2 patriarch @entity1 unleashing another homophobic rant - just months after the tv show 's network suspended him for a similar tirade			1
@entity1 was filmed giving an @entity8 sermon at @entity9 in his hometown of @entity11 , @entity12 on april 20 , according to the video on @entity14			1
in the footage , the 68 - year - old expresses his anger at the outcry over his december interview in @entity20 , in which he likened homosexuality to bestiality and branded gay people sinners			1
' they were mad at me , ' he tells the congregation in the video			1
' you say , " why 'd they get mad at you ? " @entity32 instead of acknowledging their sin , like you had better do , they railed against me for giving them the truth about their sins			1
" is homosexual behavior a sin ? " the guy asked me			1
i said , " do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of @entity56 ? do n't be deceived "			1
' paraphrasing a @entity59 verse , he continued : ' neither the sexually immoral , nor the idolators nor adulterers nor male prostitutes , nor homosexual offenders , nor thieves , nor greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of @entity56			2
' ' that list of sins covered me in my past life , ' he said			0
' we 've all been there			0
the reason we 're here today is to remind us of the gospel that 's preached			0
' his rant is met by scattered applause and cheers from the congregation			0
it comes just five months after @entity1 , a born - again @entity82 , gave the controversial @entity20 interview			1
tirade : the congregation claps as he repeats that gay people - as well as thieves and cheaters - are sinners ' everything is blurred on what ’s right and what 's wrong			2
sin becomes fine , ' he said in the interview			1
' start with homosexual behavior and just morph out from there			0
' @entity99 , sleeping around with this woman and that woman and that woman and those men ... neither the adulterers , the idolaters , the male prostitutes , the homosexual offenders , the greedy , the drunkards , the slanderers , the swindlers - they wo n't inherit the kingdom of @entity56			2
' his homophobic comments also included such insights as : ' it seems like , to me , a vagina - as a man - would be more desirable than a man 's anus			2
' that 's just me			0
i ’m just thinking : there ’s more there ! she 's got more to offer			0
i mean , come on , dudes ! you know what i 'm saying ? but hey , sin : it 's not logical , my man			2
it 's just not logical			0
' he also grouped homosexuals with terrorists , saying , ' we never , ever judge someone on who 's going to heaven , hell			0
that 's the @entity141 's job			0
we just love ' em , give ' em the good news about @entity143 - whether they 're homosexuals , drunks , terrorists			0
we let @entity56 sort ' em out later , you see what i 'm saying ? ' after the interview emerged , @entity1 was put on indefinite hiatus from @entity2			1
in hot water : @entity1 , 68 , was briefly suspended from @entity2 last december following an interview while his removal was lauded by gay rights organizations , fans of the show denounced it as a violation of his right to free speech			1
conservative supporters included @entity163 , who wrote in a @entity165 post : ' free speech is an endangered species			0
those intolerants ' hatin ' and taking on the @entity2 patriarch for voicing his personal opinion are taking on all of us			0
' @entity172 initially said his views were ' disappointing ' but two weeks later , they announced that @entity1 would be included when they began filming again in the new year			1
' after discussions with the @entity1 family , as well as consulting with numerous advocacy groups , @entity172 has decided to resume filming @entity2 later this spring with the entire @entity1 family , ' the network said in a statement			1
uncertain future : @entity2 ( the cast is pictured ) has seen lower ratings since the tirade last year @entity1 also released a public apology saying , in part : ' i would never treat anyone with disrespect just because they are different from me			1
' we are all created by the @entity141 and like @entity192 , i love all of humanity			0
we would all be better off if we loved @entity56 and loved each other			0
' whether or not this latest rant will affect his position on the show - which has suffered falling ratings since the first tirade - has yet to be seen			2
the show is scheduled to begin its sixth season on june 11 .			2

@entity1 , 68 , was briefly suspended from the show by @entity172 last year after he likened homosexuality to bestiality in @entity20 interview
a new video that was filmed in his @entity12 church last month shows him lambasting the people who *criticized* him for his comments
' instead of acknowledging their sin , they railed against me for giving them the truth , ' he says in the video . ' do n't deceive yourselves '
