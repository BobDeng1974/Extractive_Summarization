payment row : police officers claimed as much as £ 85m compensation for accidents while at work between 2008 and 2013 - at a time when budgets were being cut by 20 % five forces declined to provide an answer to the @entity31 request			1
the staggering amount paid out in compensation is revealed at a time when considerable cuts are being made to police budgets			1
in recent years , the @entity37 announced police funding would fall by 20 percent by 2015 and more than 10,460 officers would lose their jobs			2
as a result , earlier this year it was reported that the number of police officers in @entity45 and @entity46 is now at the lowest level in more than a decade			1
the 2.6 per cent dip in officer numbers follows a sharp reduction in funding			0
there has also been a marked decline in the number of community support officers , or @entity56 , with current figures showing 13,552 - down six per cent in a year			2
critics have pointed out that some of the claims were more legitimate than others - and those that were frivolous should not have been accepted			0
@entity63 of @entity64 said : ' in some cases the reasons behind claims are frankly ridiculous and should be rejected			1
' among the compensation claims made were one for £ 3,300 after an officer caught his finger in a vacuum cleaner			1
£ 130,000 for an officer who fell over and broke his hip in a store room			0
£ 12,019 for an officer shot by a colleague in @entity77 after suffering post-traumatic stress disorder			0

the majority of payouts were in @entity113 to officers who suffered hearing loss due to a firearms fault			0
not all claims have however been successful or been pursued			0
in september 2013 , pc @entity118 , who planned to sue the owner of a petrol station after tripping on a kerb while investigating a break - in , dropped her claim for damages			2
ms @entity118 faced controversy after she filed a civil claim against @entity128 , a garage owner in @entity129 , @entity130 , demanding he reimburse the income she lost as a result of injuries sustained at the scene			0
she had filed against the owner of the @entity137 's @entity136 , claiming he failed to ensure she was ' reasonably safe ' after responding to a reported burglary			0
she allegedly fell and hurt her leg and wrist while checking the building in august 2012			0
a month after she filed her claim home secretary @entity142 told the @entity145 ’s annual conference that she wanted to see an end to ' frivolous ' legal claims			0
she told delegates of the @entity145 , which had funded @entity150 ' legal costs : ' i know that the vast majority of you are dedicated public servants of the best kind			0
' but when a police officer sues a member of the public because they slipped on private property - that is simply not the sort of attitude police officers should exhibit			1
' i want to work with the @entity145 to make sure police officers do n’t make frivolous claims			2
' ms @entity118 subsequently dropped the case , with the garage owner welcoming the move as ' a victory for common sense '			2
