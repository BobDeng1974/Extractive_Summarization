dr. @entity10 of @entity11 in @entity12 believes that people may feel uneasy during the festivities			1
' they may be feeling a little more on edge			1
a little more tearful perhaps or a little more irritable and less patient , ' he told @entity18			1
people who did not participate in the race may be overwhelmed even though they did not experience the trauma directly			2
not only is grieving necessary says @entity10 , so is looking back at how far @entity12 has come as a community			1
' the progress these guys have been able to make is largely because of the generosity of strangers			0
in the midst of the horror and all the evil that was there , look at the good thatâ € ™ s been coming out , ' he said			0
@entity10 will be in @entity45 on marathon monday to support the runners raising money for his rehab			1
he spoke of the importance of coming together to help one another after the tragic event			0

' the progress these guys have been able to make is largely because of the generosity of strangers			0

being , or more appropriately the mantra ' @entity65 , ' does n't have to do with being happy all the time			0
all people should expect to feel anxious sometimes , because overcoming adversity makes people stronger and brings them together			2
@entity10 stressed that recovery has very much to do with help from the @entity12 community at large even though last year 's crime scene was cleaned away , memories of the tragedy still linger on			2

people may feel anxiety related to the bombings even if they were not *physically* *present*
