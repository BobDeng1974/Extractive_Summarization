they emerged as a novel way for the rich and famous to expand their homes , but now ' mega basements ' are set to be outlawed in one of @entity7 's wealthiest areas			1
the @entity9 borough of @entity10 and @entity11 has become the first local authority in the country to introduce restrictions on controversial subterranean developments			1
basement extensions several storeys below the ground have become increasingly popular in some of the capital 's most expensive neighbourhoods as home - owners attempt to increase their living space without infringing strict planning controls			2
they have led to the creation of what are known as ' iceberg homes ' , with the extra space earmarked to accommodate private cinemas , spas and swimming pools			1
however , the days of plush ' mega-basements ' may be numbered in the desirable @entity9 area @entity41 , founder of the estate agents @entity43 , and @entity45 , heir to the @entity47 fortune , were said to be among those to have sought permission for basement extensions in the capital in recent years			0
the trend has gathered pace in the last decade			0
the likes of @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity57 have all extended underground			0
however , doing so comes at a premium			0
last august , millionaire hedge fund boss @entity59 was order to pay Â£ 800,000 to create a huge two - storey underground basement below his two adjoining @entity10 townhouses			1
he received the unprecedented levy from @entity10 and @entity64 when he was granted planning permission for the extension , which houses a swimming pool , spa and ' treatment area '			1
the basements have drawn repeated complaints from neighbours about noise and dust			2

file picture in 2001 there were just 46 planning applications for basement developments in @entity10 and @entity11 , rising to 450 last year			1
the council said they have also increased in size , with two and three - storey basements ' not uncommon '			2
they have drawn repeated complaints from neighbouring residents about noise and dust			2
now after a two - year process , @entity10 and @entity11 council has announced that a @entity93 planning inspector has given the green light to its proposals to curb the scale of subterranean development			1
actress @entity98 hit out at her neighbours ' basements in upmarket @entity101 - many of whom she said hardly even use their homes basement extensions will still be permitted but the new rules will restrict how far they can stretch under a garden , limit them to a single storey in most cases and ban developments under listed buildings altogether			1
council cabinet member for planning policy @entity113 said : ' basements have been the single greatest planning concern our residents have expressed to us in living memory			1
' many have experienced years of misery from noise , vibration , dust and construction traffic			0
' two years ago we started drafting a policy to try and strike the right balance between addressing our residents ' concerns and the genuine need for people to expand their homes			2
' it has n't been easy and basement developers have aggressively opposed us every step of the way			0
we are delighted that the inspector agrees that we have got it right while at the same time praising us for our extensive public consultation			0
' this ruling is a victory not only for the council but also our residents who have been overwhelmingly supportive of what we have been trying to do			2
' the new guidelines are set to be formally adopted at the next full council meeting in january			0
actress @entity98 expressed the outrage of many earlier this year , hitting out at her new neighbours in upmarket @entity101 - many of whom she said hardly even use their homes			0
the dynasty actress , 80 , told a residents ' magazine : ' it 's really sad			0
i find it shocking that people are digging down to put in swimming pools and bowling alleys when they only live here for two or three months of the year			0
' @entity161 guitarist @entity160 also took umbrage at building work near his @entity10 home			1
writing online last month he said : ' @entity10 used to be a nice quiet decent place to live ... now it 's becoming a hellhole '			1
well - heeled residents have started to hit back - in june of last year @entity168 , @entity169 , joined 57 other resident in @entity171 in lodging an official objection to basement plans on her @entity175 street .			0
