by @entity0 a pair of trousers found in a @entity4 graveyard might just be the oldest ever found			1
the clothing is thought to date back a staggering 3,000 years , and despite the fact the ancient apparel has undergone considerable wear and tear , it still looks remarkably intact			1
the find was made along with a host of other clothing items in the @entity14 in @entity4 's vast @entity15			1
what are thought to be the world 's oldest trousers ( pictured ) have been discovered in one of the @entity14 in @entity4 's @entity15			1
the trousers are made of three bits of cloth , one for each leg and one for the crotch , stitched together			2
a woven decoration is also visible on the trousers , thought to have been used for horse riding the trousers , which could actually date up to 3,300 years old , are thought to be the oldest ever discovered			1
a new paper by @entity30 and colleagues of the @entity32 in @entity33 suggests the invention of trousers is linked to horseback riding			0
finds , such as the one reported at the @entity39 cemetery , highlight fragments of woollen trousers dating back to the 13th and 10th centuries @entity42 the age of the trousers corresponds to the known age of horse riding , which is thought to have begun up to 4,000 years ago			1
‘ together with horse gear and weapons as grave goods in both tombs our results specify former assumptions that the invention of bifurcated [ split into two parts ] lower body garments is related to the new epoch of horseback riding , mounted warfare and greater mobility , ’ wrote the researchers			0
‘ trousers are essential parts of the tool kit with which humans improve their physical qualities			0
’ they signify a period when people needed new clothing for horse riding			1
older clothing such as robes and togas were not suitable for riding , leading to the rise in popularity of trousers			2
the finding was reported in a paper for the @entity79			0
‘ this new paper definitely supports the idea that trousers were invented for horse riding by mobile pastoralists , and that trousers were brought to the @entity15 by horse - riding peoples , ’ linguist @entity80 from the @entity81 told @entity82			2
horse riding is thought to have begun up to 4,000 years ago , suggesting that trousers , too , could have originated that far back			1
the discovery at @entity93 were of two men thought to be 40 years - old , wearing the trousers			2
the clothing suggests they were herders - but they were likely warriors , too			0
among the items recovered with the men were a whip , a wooden horse bit , a battle - axe and a bow			0
the find was made along with a host of other clothing items in the @entity14 in @entity4 's vast @entity15 other items have also been found as part of the project known as @entity110			1
these include various garments dating back 3,000 years discovered in eastern central @entity113			0
a fur coat ( pictured being analysed by @entity32 and @entity4 scientists ) , is among the finds and each of the relics is said to be of great value the age of the trousers was estimated using radiocarbon dating and their design , perhaps understandably , was fairly primitive compared to modern standards			1
the two pairs were each made of three pieces of cloth - one for each leg and one for the crotch			0
a ‘ belt ’ of sorts had been fashioned from strings , while the garments themselves were decorated with a woven design			0
the @entity93 tombs are a vast ancient cemetery spanning approximately 580,000 square feet ( 54,000 square metres )			2
the hot and dry climate in the area known as the @entity15 has helped to preserve corpses , clothing and other artefacts for thousands of years			0
since digs at the site began in the 1970s , over 500 tombs have been excavated with numerous finds made .			0
