’ the development came the day after @entity3 spoke publicly to deny that he had sex with miss @entity12			1
prince @entity3 seen leaving his luxury chalet in @entity22 , @entity23 , where he is attending the @entity25 in @entity26 in an unprecedented move , the duke used a televised speech in @entity26 to ‘ reaffirm ’ @entity31 ’s emphatic denials that he had ever had ‘ any form of sexual contact or relationship ’ with his accuser			1
@entity37 from carefully scripted notes , the prince said : ' firstly i think i must , and want , for the record to refer to the events that have taken place in the last few weeks			2
' and i just wish to reiterate and to reaffirm the statements which have already been made on my behalf by @entity31			2
' he added : ' my focus is on my work and this evening 's reception allows me to tell you about just a couple of the initiatives that i have founded and am passionate about			2
' the @entity51 looked sombre as he left his £ 13million ski chalet in @entity22 , @entity23 , today and is expected to make another appearance at the forum			2
the lurid accusations have overshadowed his trip to the @entity25 , where he was a key speaker			0
he looked sombre as he left his luxury £ 22,000 - a - week ski chalet in @entity22 , @entity23 today miss @entity12 alleges @entity3 abused her on three occasions in 2001 when she was 17 – in @entity61 , @entity62 and at an orgy with other girls in the @entity65			1
the extraordinary letter sent to the duke by her lawyers states : ‘ this is a formal request to interview you under oath ... at a time and place of your choosing			2
’ but they say couriers @entity75 returned the letter because it was ‘ refused ’ by the recipient at @entity31			2
it remains to be seen whether the @entity81 embassy in @entity18 would accept any letter sent on behalf of @entity14			0
when asked about the possibility last night , a spokesman for the @entity84 sighed and said he had no information			0
legal experts also say the duke runs the risk of being ambushed with a subpoena next time he visits the @entity92			0

in the papers , she claimed @entity103 not only abused her from the age of 15 but had also ‘ procured ’ her for several of his ‘ powerful ’ friends , including @entity3			1
@entity31 has issued two strong denials on @entity3 ’s @entity117 of damaging claims about his alleged relationship with miss @entity12 were sparked at the beginning of the month when her lawyers lodged papers with a @entity92 court as part of a legal battle against @entity103			1
in the papers , she claimed that @entity103 had not only repeatedly abused her from the age of 15 but had also ' procured ' her for several of his ' powerful ' friends , including @entity3			1
miss @entity12 alleges she and the royal had sex when she was aged around 17 , still a minor under @entity92 law in some states			1
@entity31 has issued two strong denials on @entity3 's behalf , which state that not only is there is no foundation in the allegations but that he never had any sexual contact or relationship with his accuser			1
@entity103 has also called miss @entity12 a liar			1
then on wednesday papers were filed in a @entity141 court revealing that miss @entity12 's lawyers have written to @entity3 asking him to testify on oath about the nature of their relationship			1

the packed reception at the five - star @entity166 was held amid tight security			0
it is a big annual draw at @entity26 , and this year attracted the likes of disgraced former @entity172 boss @entity171 , @entity174 boss @entity173 , @entity176 's @entity175 , @entity177 of @entity178 and former trade secretary @entity179			2
miss @entity12 's lawyers sent @entity31 a letter ( above ) requesting his ' voluntary cooperation in answering questions about his sexual interactions ' with her - but it was not accepted former @entity187 prime minister @entity186 , accompanied by his wife @entity188 , was also there , however he was said to have left before the prince took to his feet			1

another male friend was seen to put his hand supportively on his shoulder for a few moments , prompting a smiling @entity3 to shake him by the hand			2
the prince , dressed in a smart suit but with trainers on due to the slippery conditions outside , left in a chauffeur - driven @entity208 15 minutes after the event ended at 8pm local time			0

pages from a detailed document filed in @entity141 by @entity12 included this photo to show how young she was at the time of the allegations @entity12 included four photos of herself in the new court filing to illustrate her connection to the places in @entity225 mentioned in the court documents it is not known whether prince @entity3 is covered by legal immunity simply by being a royal because this has never been tested in international law			1
however , the prince may be entitled to diplomatic immunity against questioning in any criminal inquiry because some of the allegations relate to when he was a @entity237 - sanctioned business envoy			2
diplomatic immunity protects foreign diplomats from legal action in the country where they work			0
