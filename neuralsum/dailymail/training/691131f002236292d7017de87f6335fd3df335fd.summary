' last month @entity9 sparked outrage when he appeared on @entity27 's @entity26 to say he deserved the £ 500,000 in benefits , adding he felt he should have received even more money			1
now one of his daughters , @entity17 ( pictured in black ) , has slammed his way of life benefits : former chef @entity9 , from @entity10 on the @entity11 , has already claimed more than £ 500,000 in state handouts over the course of his lifetime @entity44 , who is training to become a painter and decorator , said her father should have practiced safe sex to avoid having so many children			1

ms @entity44 still lives in @entity10 with her father ; brother @entity56 , 19 ; sisters @entity57 , 15 , @entity58 , 14 , and @entity59 , 17 ; and @entity59 ’s one - year - old twins			1

brazen : last month @entity9 sparked outrage when he appeared on @entity27 's @entity26 programme ( pictured ) to say he deserved the £ 500,000 in benefits , adding he felt he should have received even more demands : @entity9 is insisting his family be moved into a bigger council house after describing his three - bedroom property in @entity10 , @entity11 ( pictured ) as ' a prison ' mr @entity9 , a former chef , currently receives up to £ 800 a week in welfare payments			1
