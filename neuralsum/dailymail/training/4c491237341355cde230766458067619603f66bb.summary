mystery has deepened around the eight - tonne @entity3 - observing @entity2 satellite after the satellite fell silent - and has failed to enter the ' safe mode ' expected of ailing space vehicles			1
in ' safe mode ' , it would use its power to angle its solar panels towards the sun. without it , it could fail permanently			1
scientists and engineers are scrambling to pinpoint the problems afflicting the satellite - radar images from @entity3 appear to show that it 's intact			1
if no other solution is found , a high - resolution imaging satellite , @entity19 , will scan the craft on sunday			1
' after 10 years of service , @entity2 has stopped sending data to @entity3			2
@entity25 's mission control is working to re-establish contact with the satellite , ' says the @entity25 ' we continue to try to re-establish contact with the satellite , and to collect more information on the satellite 's status by ground radar images , from optical images , from telescopes , but also from other spacecraft , ' said professor @entity37 of @entity25			1
the satellite failed to radio to its controllers on april 8 - and a team of engineers , scientists and mission operators are now attempting to restore contact with the satellite			1
" on sunday , will try to program the satellite @entity19 to see if they can image @entity2 , to give us more detailed knowledge on whether there is damage on the outside , ' he said			2
' after 10 years of service , @entity2 has stopped sending data to @entity3			2
@entity25 's mission control is working to re-establish contact with the satellite , ' says the @entity25			1
' the first sign that there was a problem came on 08 april when contact with the satellite was unexpectedly lost , preventing the reception of any data as it passed over the @entity65 ground station in @entity66			0
' the eight - tonne @entity2 had a planned lifetime of five years , but has doubled that - and the @entity25 has celebrated the anniversary with a gallery of the unforgettable imagery captured by @entity2 's eight sensors			0
more than 2,000 scientific publications have been based on @entity2 data			0
@entity2 's data has been used in 4,000 science projects in 70 countries , including landmark research into climate @entity79 study of ocean currents was used last year to simulate dispersal of nuclear pollution from the @entity85 accident , and it gained real - time images of the @entity88 oil spill in the @entity89 in 2010			0
clouds south of the @entity91 : a unique cloud formation was captured by @entity2 in this false - colour image with ten sophisticated optical and radar sensors , the satellite continuously observes and monitors @entity3 ’s land , atmosphere , oceans and ice caps			1
in 2010 , the satellite ’s orbit was changed to allow @entity2 to continue operating for at least another three years - so its sudden silence is a worry for its ground team			2
its replacement - – the @entity107 – will become fully operational in 2013			0
@entity2 ’s largest instrument is the @entity109 , which can be used day or night because it sees through clouds and darkness			0
this is particularly useful over polar regions , which are prone to long periods of bad weather and extended darkness			0
other instruments include the @entity117 , which measures surface topography to an accuracy of a few centimetres , revealing the changes in sea - surface height over time			0
a phytoplankton bloom in the @entity124 east of the @entity125 the @entity126 , captured in a radar view that highlights minute changes in sea surface level			0

satellite has failed to enter ' safe mode ' to preserve power
unless it moves its solar panels , it could fail permanently
radar images from @entity3 appear to show satellite is *undamaged*
high - resolution @entity19 satellite to *inspect* ' dead ' craft on sunday
radio silence since it failed to make contact on *tuesday*
