@entity1 ’s next move after taking revenge on @entity3 will not be in pursuit of a world title but to @entity6			1
@entity1 put @entity9 boxing ’s bitterest of rivalries to bed with a convincing victory in front of his home fans in @entity15			1
he will now turn his attention to the silver screen after landing a major role in the @entity20 spin - off @entity21			1
the film , which will be shot in @entity23 and @entity24 , will chronicle the boxing career of @entity27 ’s grandson @entity26 , who will be played by @entity28			1
‘ i ’m going to @entity6 on december 4 for an assignment , ’ said a coy @entity1			1
‘ i ’ve been sought - after for a long time			2
i hope it ’s a speaking part because no - one wants to look at this face if i ’m not talking			1
my life ’s going to change			2
‘ i ’ve had the contracts sitting in front of me for weeks because i was n’t signing them			0
if this fight had gone wrong i was n’t signing , i was going home to be depressed			0
‘ i ca n’t go into the details but let ’s just say it ’s big			2
it will be 40 - odd days of filming , i just hope i can do it			2
’ @entity3 tries to protect his face after @entity1 throws a punch in the direction of the @entity68 @entity1 ’s boxing career might be on the back burner for now but he turned the tables on @entity72 three years after losing their first fight			1
the build - up to their rematch had been bitter , with both men promising an explosive finish , but it failed to spark			2
‘ it was n’t a great fight because he did n’t want to fight , ’ said @entity1			1
‘ i stood there all night and he did n’t want to know			0
his right hand was superglued to the side of his face			0
‘ it takes two to make a fight			0
it was so wide and so easy and i was n’t out of second gear			0
i did n’t get to show what i can do at this weight , i was at 50 per cent			0
it was a bad performance			0
’ incredibly , one judge awarded the fight to @entity3			1
‘ i do n’t know what @entity97 was watching , ’ said @entity1			1
‘ i ’m going to put a complaint in to the board to get them to tell him to stop smoking whatever he ’s smoking			0
‘ there should n’t be @entity107 judges for a domestic grudge fight because they see the whole build - up			1
in their heads , there ’s a good guy and a bad guy and i ’ve been portrayed as the bad guy			0
@entity1 dodges a punch from @entity72 in the early rounds of the fight at the @entity118 @entity1 aims a punch at his @entity9 rival while @entity3 puts his hand up to block ‘ this was a massive fight and it ’s been everywhere			1
they think i ’m a real gobs * * * * and they come into the arena and expect to judge the fight from a neutral perspective			0
‘ he obviously made his mind up who was winning before he sat down			0
‘ you ca n’t have him winning that fight			0
when i heard “ split decision ” i thought , here we go again , my mouth ’s run away with itself again			1
’ @entity3 ’s future , meanwhile , is less certain after his second defeat in his last four fights			1
the @entity68 revealed he hurt his right hand and that he struggled to hold @entity144 off in the later stages			0
‘ i caught @entity1 on the head and i abandoned my right from the third round but i do n’t want to use that as an excuse			2
@entity3 struggled to cope with @entity1 throughout the cruiserweight showdown ‘ i ’m 25lb heavier at cruiserweight and it ’s difficult to carry that for 12 rounds			1
i slowed in the second half of the fight and @entity1 used his natural weight advantage			2
‘ i ’m not a true cruiserweight , i ’m caught in between weights			0
going back down to light - heavyweight is an option			0
’ @entity3 was keen to hype the possibility of a third fight but in reality this was an attritional bout which was slow to catch fire , and these protagonists may struggle to engage the interest of the public for a decisive third meeting			2
@entity3 said : ‘ a split decision shows how much character i ’ve got			1
maybe we will have a third fight one day — i ’ve been to @entity15 twice so maybe next time it could be in the @entity177 in @entity178			0

@entity1 edged out @entity3 via split decision by the judges
