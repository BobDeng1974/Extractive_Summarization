a murderer walked out of prison and went on the run for nine years – even claiming benefits , obtaining a passport and going abroad on holiday			1
the disappearance of @entity8 @entity7 , 53 , should have triggered a manhunt after he absconded from a @entity11 open prison in 2005			1

murder victim : @entity18 , left , with his younger brother @entity19			1
@entity7 and his girlfriend attacked @entity18 with a wrench , hammer and knife before writing ' @entity24 ' on the wall with his blood he rented a flat , claimed thousands in benefits , went to @entity28 on holiday and even complained to police that youths had been throwing stones at his window			1
@entity33 was only recaptured after the @entity34 was tipped off about him , traced his whereabouts and spent a week urging police to act			2

however , just months before his release , he walked out of @entity71 , near @entity72 , @entity11 , because he was stressed and fed up with being bullied , according to his parents			1
instead of mounting a manhunt , @entity74 merely logged his disappearance on a national database			1
it took no further action , even after being contacted by the @entity34			2
instead it was left to the @entity81 , which dealt with the original murder , to travel to @entity83 and arrest @entity33			1

he ’s got one leg longer than the other and walks with a crutch and a stick			0

in 2005 , a police family liaison officer even refused to tell her which prison he walked out of because of the killer ’s ‘ right to privacy ’			1
she said : ‘ i ’m ecstatic he ’s been caught			0
now i want him to serve the time he should ’ve served in the first place			0

i have spent the last nine years full of anger and living in fear			0
