by @entity0 @entity1 : 07:37 est , 21 december 2013 @entity2 : 11:23 est , 21 december 2013 an artificial heart has been transplanted into a patient for the first time in medical history , it was announced today			1
@entity9 medics said that a male patient was awake and responding well following wednesday ’s ground - breaking operation at the @entity12 in @entity13			1
@entity14 , head of the @entity16 biomedical firm , said : ‘ we are delighted with this first implant , although it is premature to draw conclusions given that a single implant has been performed and that we are in the early postoperative phase			1
' surgeons in @entity9 have transplanted the first ever artificial heart , pictured , successfully into a patient @entity9 @entity25 and health minister @entity26 , left , and @entity27 , surgeon and @entity16 co-founder attend a news conference at the @entity30 in @entity13 mr @entity14 said the artificial heart , which is three times the weight of a real one , would beat for at least five years			1
heart - assistance devices have frequently been used for patients waiting for transplants , but the new bioprosthetic device will replace the real heart it will help thousands of people who are die each year while waiting for a donor , including many in @entity43			1
surgeon @entity27 said : ‘ it 's about giving patients a normal social life with the least dependence on medication as possible			0
‘ we ’ve already seen these types of device of this type but they had a relatively low autonomy			2
this heart will allow for more movement and less clotting			2
the study that is starting is being very closely watched in the medical field			0
’ ‘ this news brings great pride to @entity9 , ’ said the @entity26 , @entity9 health minister			0
’ it shows we are pioneers in healthcare , that we can invent , that we can carry an innovation that will also bring great hope to plenty of people			0
’ in 2005 surgeons in @entity9 performed the first face transplant , and they are always trying to push back research frontiers			0
the male patient is said to be awake and responding well following the operation at the @entity12 in @entity13 developed by a team of engineers from @entity78 parent company @entity77 , the artificial heart weighs 2 lb - almost three times as much as an average healthy human heart			1
it is expected to cost around £ 150,000 if it is made widely available			0
the device mimics heart muscle contractions and contains sensors that adapt the blood flow to the patient 's moves			1
the artificial heart is powered by external , wearable lithium - ion batteries			1
inside the heart , surfaces that come into contact with human blood are made partly from bovine tissue instead of synthetic materials such as plastic that can cause blood clots			2
heart failure affects more men than women , and the size of the artificial heart means it can fit in 86 percent of men but only around 20 percent of women			2
but @entity106 says it can manufacture a smaller version to fit the smaller bodies of women as well as patients in @entity112 and @entity113			0
the artifical organ replicates the heart muscles contractions to push blood around the body heart failure is when the organ is no longer able to pump blood around the body			1
it is commonly caused by coronary artery diseases and hypertension			0
almost half of patients die within a year of first being hospitalised with the condition			0
for those suffering the most severe form of heart failure a transplant is the only option			2
but only around 4,000 hearts are available around the world each year - compared with around 100,000 people on the transplant list			0
research into the artificial heart began in the @entity141 in 1963			0
it is a device which replaces the heart			1
it works by replicating the heart muscle to beat blood around the body , supplying other organs			1
in the past patients have had artificial hearts implanted as temporary measures , to bridge the gap until a live donor can be found .			0

male patient is responding well following the ground - breaking operation at the @entity12 in @entity13
biomedical firm @entity16 said they are ' delighted ' with the first implant but added it is still very early stages
device , which is powered by an external battery , is three times the weight of a real organ and mimics the heart muscle contractions
