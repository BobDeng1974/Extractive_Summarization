by @entity0 published : 10:15 est , 30 march 2012 updated : 11:27 est , 30 march 2012 @entity1 has been ordered to announce an immediate ceasefire as fears mount that it will not honour an earlier promise to do so			0
president @entity6 agreed to a six - point peace plan laid out by @entity8 this week - but as fighting rages on , hopes of peace are fading			1
a spokesman for the @entity14 envoy today told the @entity6 regime : ' the deadline is now			0
' his demands came as opposition activists reported yet more violence had erupted between soldiers and rebel forces in the country 's northern @entity24 province today			0
for many the talk of a ceasefire has come too late , with fresh pictures showing the flashpoint city of @entity30 in ruins			1
more than 9,000 people have been killed in @entity1 's violence since last march , according to @entity35 estimates			0
ghost town : bombed - out buildings and the wreckage of a car in the old city of @entity30 today			2
as talk of ceasefire drags on , the @entity35 estimates the conflict has already claimed more than 9,000 lives chaos : cables trail overhead after the poles supporting them were knocked down in fierce fighting between rebel troops and government forces ravaged : chunks of rubble hang precariously from the rooftops of @entity30 , which has stood in a state of desolation since residents endured a ruthless campaign of shelling meanwhile , @entity60 secretary of state @entity59 sought to work out a unified strategy on the crisis in talks with @entity65 officials today			1
mrs @entity59 's talks with @entity65 @entity67 and other officials come ahead of a 60 - nation gathering of the @entity70 in @entity71 over the weekend , aimed at finding ways to aid @entity1 's opposition			1
the @entity60 is hoping to help unify the splintered opposition 's ranks while pushing for humanitarian aid and further isolation of mr @entity6 's regime			1
@entity65 , along with fellow @entity80 nation @entity79 , has called for a more aggressive approach , including arming the rebels and carving out a safe haven inside @entity1 from which the opposition can operate			2
@entity1 has accepted mr @entity8 's six - point plan , which includes a call for a ceasefire , but the opposition suspects mr @entity6 has no intention of stopping his crackdown and is only playing for time			1
the president said yesterday that he wants the plan to succeed , but insisted that the opposition must first commit to a ceasefire as well			2
@entity8 urged the @entity1 government to halt its troops first			0
too late ? bullet - riddled shells of buildings are all that remains in parts of @entity30 , where the worst of the @entity6 regime 's crackdown has taken its toll scorched : an ornate gateway in @entity30 bears the scars of a bloody battle while the building next door is badly burned , its shutters buckled ruined : a broken pipe spews water into an empty street in @entity30 as a damaged vehicle lies in pieces destroyed : new pictures from the war - torn city of @entity30 show how buildings have been blown apart , left , while a car lies upturned and abandoned , right , in what was said to have been a hotspot for @entity124 sentiment alliance : king @entity67 , right , meets with @entity60 secretary of state @entity59 in @entity125 as the the two countries seek a strategy to stop the bloodshed in @entity1 ' the government must stop first and then discuss a cessation of hostilities with the other side , ' @entity8 spokesman @entity129 said today			1
' we are appealing to the stronger party to make a gesture of good faith			0
... the deadline is now			0
' ' clearly , we have not seen a cessation of hostilities and this is of great concern , ' he said			0
mrs @entity59 arrived in @entity125 and began talks with @entity65 foreign minister @entity145 , the @entity65 @entity143 said			1
the @entity65 official news agency said she then met with @entity67 in his palace in @entity125 , along with top @entity65 intelligence and security officials			0
' @entity151 will hold extensive talks with @entity65 counterparts on the situation in @entity1 and on @entity60 efforts to stop bloodbath in @entity1 , ' a @entity65 @entity143 official in @entity125 said			1
he spoke on condition of anonymity because he is not authorised to discuss the talks			0
the talks came a day after an @entity162 summit in @entity163 , where divisions among @entity166 nations over @entity1 were clear			1
in a sign that they see little hope in the @entity14 's diplomatic efforts , @entity65 , @entity79 and other @entity80 countries sent only low - level officials to the summit			1
in the end , the summit issued a joint resolution that held little new beyond expressing support for mr @entity8 's efforts			1
president @entity177 has publicly challenged mr @entity6 to leave power , but has refused to entertain @entity60 military options to achieve that end			1
@entity181 has said it opposes military intervention in @entity1 , fearing that it would fuel an outright civil war that could break along dangerous sectarian lines			1
the opposition is born mainly from @entity1 's @entity187 majority , while mr @entity6 's regime is backed by his own minority @entity190 community , a @entity193 offshoot sect			2
for the @entity60 and its allies , @entity1 is proving an especially murky conflict and one with no easy solutions			0
mr @entity6 's regime is of @entity181 's clearest foes , a government that has long been closely allied with @entity199 and anti-israel groups @entity201 and @entity202			1
fighting rages on : a frame from a video uploaded to @entity206 this week shows smoke billowing from reported shelling by @entity1 government forces on a residential area in @entity30 @entity65 and other @entity187 - led @entity80 countries are eager to see mr @entity6 's fall in hopes of breaking @entity1 out of its alliance with their regional rival , @entity193 - majority @entity199			1
but the @entity1 opposition is chronically fragmented			0
the @entity217 , a nominal opposition umbrella group based abroad , has limited authority on the ground			0
@entity1 army defectors have set up a military leadership based in neighbouring @entity222 , but they too have only nominal command over the multiple armed rebel groups inside @entity1			0
the @entity60 has warned that @entity225 and other @entity227 militants are also taking advantage of the turmoil , attacking mr @entity6 's regime and trying to gain a foothold inside @entity1			2
aftermath : mr @entity6 is shown touring the former rebel stronghold of @entity30 this week , assuring residents that the neighbourhood would be rebuilt and unlike @entity235 , whose leader @entity236 inspired worldwide revulsion , @entity1 still has allies in @entity240 and @entity199 and a formidable army of its own			2
on thursday , @entity199 's supreme leader , ayatollah @entity242 , vowed to support mr @entity6 during talks with the prime minister of @entity222 , a country which was once close to @entity245 but now backs the opposition			1
' @entity199 will defend @entity1 because of [ its ] support of the resistance front against the @entity250 regime and is strongly opposed to any interference by foreign forces in @entity1 's internal affairs , ' mr @entity242 said			0
' the @entity254 of @entity199 is categorically opposed to any plan initiated by the @entity60 regarding @entity1			2
' asked what might constitute success for sunday 's @entity70 meeting in @entity71 , @entity257 spokeswoman @entity256 said , ' we want to see as much unity as possible among those members of the opposition			0
' she said conversations also would focus on humanitarian aid and further isolating @entity6 's government			2
that is the same agenda as the first gathering of the @entity70 , in february in @entity270			0
there , the nations issued an ultimatum to @entity6 to end the hostilities , but it was roundly ignored			2
speaking on tuesday , mrs @entity59 cautiously welcomed the @entity1 government 's endorsement of mr @entity8 's plan			1
but mr @entity6 now has to make good on the deal , she said , citing the @entity1 leader 's ' history of overpromising and under - delivering ' when it comes to pledges of peace and reform			2
mrs @entity59 said the @entity60 and its allies would spend the next few days helping @entity1 's primarily @entity187 opposition refine its vision of an inclusive democracy , to assure minorities still supportive of the government that they 'd have a place in a @entity293 future			1
she said @entity181 hoped for progress on that front this weekend			0
human cost : @entity1 attend a mass funeral for people said to have been killed by security forces in earlier protests in @entity301 , near @entity245 , this week			0
fresh fighting is said to have erupted today			0

president @entity6 has agreed to *implement* six - point peace plan - but says opposition fighters must lay down their weapons first
fresh images show the flashpoint city of @entity30 in ruins as fighting shows little sign of *slowing* down
@entity60 secretary of state @entity59 holds talks with @entity65 king to agree strategy to end the ' bloodbath '
an @entity162 summit in @entity163 looks to have achieved little more than support for @entity8 's *proposal*
@entity181 refuses to stage military intervention for fears of *sparking* sectarian civil war
