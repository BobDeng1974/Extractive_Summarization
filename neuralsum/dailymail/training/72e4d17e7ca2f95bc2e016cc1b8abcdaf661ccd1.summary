four years ago this month , archeologists monitoring the excavation of the former @entity2 uncovered a surprise - part of an ancient sailing ship			2
at 22 feet ( 6.7 meters ) below today 's street level , in a pit that is now an underground security and parking complex , work was forced to stop as excavators uncovered the ancient ship			1
researchers were baffled by the vessel , but a new study has finally revealed how old the ship was - and how it came to be under the site			2
after 20 to 30 years of service , it is thought to have sailed to its final resting place in lower @entity38 , a block west of @entity39			0
as trade in @entity42 and the young country flourished , @entity38 ’s western shoreline inched westward until the ship was eventually buried by trash and other landfill			2
by 1818 , the ship would have vanished from view completely until the terrorist attacks on sept. 11 , 2001 set in motion the events leading to the @entity2 ’s excavation and rebirth			2
the team were able to analyse tree rings on the wooden ' skeleton to show the boat came from wood cut in @entity60 in 1773			1
tree - ring scientists at @entity63 ’s @entity62 were among those asked to analyze its remains for clues about its age and origins			2
researchers at the lab dried the fragments slowly in a cold room and cut thick slices of the wood to get a clear look at the tree rings			1
in a study now out in the journal @entity82 , the scientists say that an old growth forest in the @entity85 area supplied the white oak used in the ship ’s frame , and that the trees were probably cut in 1773 or so — a few years before the bloody war that established @entity92 ’s independence from @entity93			1
the ship itself has been tentatively identified as a @entity29 , designed by the @entity30 to carry passengers and cargo over shallow , rocky water			2
a team of archeologists with @entity42 - based @entity99 and others worked from dawn until dusk cataloging each timber and artifact before hauling the pieces off site			0
dated : researchers in a lab dried out the wood fragments and cut them into thick slices to get a clear look at the tree rings work stopped : construction on the site had to stop so the boat could be taken out of the ground by archeologists archaeologists were on - site throughout the excavation of the @entity2 's @entity120			1
they found animal bones , ceramic dishes , bottles and dozens of shoes			0
however , they were shocked to find the 32 - foot - long ( 9.75 m ) partial hull of a ship			0
the vessel was quickly excavated , to prevent damage from exposure to the air			0
piece by piece , the delicate oak fragments were scanned and taken out of the rotten - smelling mud			0
the ship was perhaps made from the same kind of white oak trees used to build parts of @entity140 , where the @entity141 and @entity142 were signed			1
the key to the analysis was wood sampled from @entity85 ’s @entity140 two decades earlier by @entity148 tree - ring scientist @entity146 , according to the researchers			1
growth rings still visible in the building ’s timbers matched those from the @entity2 ship , suggesting that the wood used in both structures came from the same region			1
as trees grow , they record the climate in which they lived , putting on tighter rings in dry years and wider rings in wet years			1
in the process , a record of the region ’s climate is created , allowing scientists to see how @entity85 ’s climate differed hundreds of years ago from say , @entity42 ’s @entity170			0
an array of munitions were also found on board , including a @entity175 - made cannonball and the @entity92 - made musket balls pictured			1
the ship ¿ s frame was riddled with small holes , suggesting it had spent time in the @entity182 , a hub in the rum , sugar and slave trade at the time			0
@entity188 , or shipworms , are native to the salty , warm waters of the @entity191 the climate fingerprint also serves as a kind of birth certificate , telling scientists where pieces of wood originated			1
the ship itself has been tentatively identified as a @entity29 , designed by the @entity30 to carry passengers and cargo over shallow , rocky water			0
it was likely built in @entity85 , a center for ship - building in colonial times			0
several ring patterns matched oak timbers found in @entity85 ¿ s @entity140 , where the @entity141 and @entity142 were signed			1
@entity62 scientist @entity146 sampled @entity140 in the late 1980s while amassing his @entity210 ; those records would be crucial in tracing the @entity2 ship ¿ s timbers to a dense , old - growth forest near @entity85			1
a button found aboard the ship ( left ) , from the coat of a private in the @entity220 @entity219 , which battled the @entity92 rebels			2
on the right the rings can be clearly seen in one of the beams			0
after 20 to 30 years of service , it is thought to have sailed to its final resting place in lower @entity38 , a block west of @entity39			0
as trade in @entity42 and the young country flourished , @entity38 ’s western shoreline inched westward until the ship was eventually buried by trash and other landfill			0
by 1818 , the ship would have vanished from view completely until the terrorist attacks on sept. 11 , 2001 set in motion the events leading to the @entity2 ’s excavation and rebirth			0
