the international team searching the @entity1 for the @entity2 are now considering the seemingly impossible scenario of the aircraft having ' landed ' somewhere , instead of crashing in the southern @entity1			1
' we may have to regroup soon to look into this possibility if no positive results come back in the next few days , ' sources within the @entity6 were quoted as telling the @entity10 today			1
' the thought of it landing somewhere else is not impossible , as we have not found a single debris that could be linked to @entity17 , ' sources were quoted as telling the paper			1
' however , the possibility of a specific country hiding the plane when more than 20 nations are searching for it , seems absurd , ' said the sources			2
but they admitted that it was difficult to determine if the plane had really ended in the @entity1 , despite calculations seeming to point to that direction			2
the @entity23 reported early in the search that fishermen and villagers living in north east @entity49 had filed official statements with police claiming to have seen - or heard - a low - flying aircraft at the time when @entity17 lost all contact with ground control			1
the plane has been missing for more than six weeks and sources are now considering the previously unthinkable prospect that it has landed somewhere the search for the plane has been concentrated on an area of the southern @entity1 , off the coast of @entity61 @entity62 has now been missing for 46 days - an important milestone as it allowed @entity65 lawyers to pursue @entity2 in @entity65 courts			1
a 45 - day rule , enforced by the @entity68 , means that families can now file suits in @entity65 courts against @entity2 , an @entity65 manufacturer			0
' we do n't feel we have a whole lot of other choices because we 're certainly not getting any answers without ( legal action ) , ' @entity71 told @entity77			0
ms @entity71 , whose partner @entity78 was on the flight , said she hoped that pressure in the courts might lead to the @entity49 government releasing important data			0
one key problem however could bt the lack of any plane			0
' if we do n't have the " black box " with all the critical information on it , or we do n't have any part of the wreckage , it would be very hard to maintain a claim against @entity2 in any court in the @entity65 , ' @entity86 , an aviation attorney from @entity87 , told @entity77			0
their descriptions of a ' very loud engine ' and headlights like those switched on by an aircraft about to land at night suggested that the aircraft was flying to the west , across jungle , very fast , at a low altitude			2
the sources told the government - controlled paper that it was difficult to determine if the plane had really ended in the @entity1 , although calculations pointed to that direction			1
the @entity49 - led investigation team , along with experts from @entity116 and the @entity118 's @entity117 , had to rely on an @entity116 communications satellite , which did not provide any definite details , including the aircraft 's direction , altitude and speed			2
one of the sources told the @entity10 : ' a communications satellite is meant for communication ... the name is self explanatory			2
' the reason investigators were forced to adopt a new algorithm to calculate the last known location of @entity17 was because there was no global positioning system following the aircraft as the transponder went off 45 minutes into the flight			1
' the source added that the international team was looking at adding more ships and aircraft to the existing search area in the @entity1 - as well as widening the area because there were fears that searchers had been ' looking for the plane in the wrong place '			1
' we ca n't focus on one place too long as the ocean is very big , although the search team has been following the leads received and analysed			1
' it is by luck if we find the wreckage using the @entity158 ( the @entity65 - owned underwater search vehicle )			2
' there is no physical evidence and we are totally depending on scientific calculations since day one , including the pings			0
' with the search now into its 45th day , @entity49 authorities are hoping more countries will come forward to share their crucial satellite and radar data			0
a map of the search area , which is 5,700 feet off the coast of @entity172			0
the area that had been search , as of sunday 20th april is shown in grey a source told the @entity10 that if they were to find debris from the jet it would be down to ' luck ' and they might need to expand the search sources said that while the plane could be on land , the possibility of a specific country hiding the plane was ' absurd ' the paper said it understood that the team had not been receiving as much information from countries as it had hoped			1
suggesting that national security of various countries was involved , the source added : ' we have mainly been provided with selective data			0
' the source said that because the information potentially involved the national security of the country from which it was requested , only partial raw data had been provided , making it difficult for @entity49 authorities to get the full picture			0
' the data involved would be official information , so the ( foreign ) country can not simply give it to us on paper or in soft copy - they will select only the ones that can be revealed			0
' the @entity49 had asked the @entity65 government to view data collected by its secret base , @entity215 , in the @entity217 outback			0
but the request had been denied , sources said , after the @entity65 had said that no contact had been made with @entity17			1
' we ca n't be forcing them to show us the data , as they had already said there was nothing , ' one source said			0
the search is currently in its 45th day and sources told the @entity10 that the search team might be looking in the wrong place anger : a @entity234 relative of a passenger on missing flight at a meeting at @entity238 in @entity239			1

sources with the search team say the aircraft may have landed somewhere , rather than crashed into the @entity1 as previously believed
if no debris is found in the next few days the team may shift search focus
