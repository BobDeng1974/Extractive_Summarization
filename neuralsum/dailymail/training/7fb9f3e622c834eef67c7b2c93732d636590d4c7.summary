a series of stunning images have been released showing @entity4 ’s comet in unprecedented detail , revealing cracks on the surface , evidence of ice , steep cliffs and more			1
the snaps of @entity12 / @entity11 accompanied yesterday ’s release of several scientific papers detailing new discoveries and observations of the comet			1
scientists around will continue poring through data from @entity4 as the comet prepares to make its closest approach to the sun in august this year , when it is expected to become considerably more active than it is now			1
shown here is the boulder - strewn , smooth @entity31 in @entity11 ’s neck , with the @entity35 cliff face to the right the pictures were analysed by various @entity25 and @entity27 scientists , revealing previously unknown characteristics of the comet			1
yesterday the shape , evolution and lifespan of comet @entity44 / @entity11 were revealed in a series of groundbreaking papers in the journal @entity48			1
using data from @entity4 , scientists revealed that the comet ’s interior is ‘ fluffy ’			1
among the other discoveries they found that the comet 's neck may have been ' eaten away ' over time , rather than being the result of two smaller bodies merging together			1
from the data , dr @entity58 from the @entity59 told @entity61 that they now had a greater understanding of the comet 's interior			1
he said the interior is now thought to be analogous to ' ash , cigarette ash or super-dry powder snow			0
' many of the images were returned by the @entity70 ) camera on the @entity4 spacecraft , which has imaged 70 percent of the comet ’s surface to date			1
the remaining 30 per cent will remain unseen and shrouded in darkness until the comet makes its closest approach to the sun in august			1
‘ @entity4 is essentially living with the comet as it moves towards the sun along its orbit , learning how its behaviour changes on a daily basis and , over longer timescales , how its activity increases , how its surface may evolve , and how it interacts with the solar wind , ’ said @entity88 project scientist @entity87			1
‘ we have already learned a lot in the few months we have been alongside the comet , but as more and more data are collected and analysed from this close study of the comet we hope to answer many key questions about its origin and evolution			0
’ from the images and data , five basic - but diverse - categories of terrain type have been determined : dust - covered ; brittle materials with pits and circular structures ; large - scale depressions ; smooth terrains ; and more ‘ rock - like ’ surfaces			2
much of the comet also appears to be covered in dust , as a result of dust that is dragged along by the comet falling to the surface over time			2
this dust is also thought to be insulating the comet , based on data from the @entity121 on the @entity122 ( @entity123 )			2
this could play a key role in helping to protect ice thought to exist below the surface			2
small patches of ice have even been spotted on the surface			2
here , a section of the smaller of @entity131 – @entity11 ’s two lobes is seen through @entity4 ’s narrow - angle camera from a distance of about five miles ( 8km ) to the surface on 14 october 2014 this is a summary of properties of the comet , as determined by @entity4 ’s instruments during the first few months of its comet encounter			1
the full range of values are presented and discussed in a series of papers published in the 23 january 2015 issue of the journal @entity48 shown is an active pit detected in the @entity149 of the comet			0
this is an @entity70 narrow - angle camera image acquired on 28 august 2014 at a distance of 37 miles ( 60km ) from the comet			0
the image resolution is 3.3 feet ( one metre ) per pixel surface textures on the border of the broad , smooth region in @entity158 , on the large lobe of the comet , are seen here on a larger scale , the images also revealed the huge exposed cliff walls on the comet , which are covered in randomly oriented fractures			1
their formation is likely due to the rapid heating - cooling cycles experience by the comet ’s 12.4 - hour ‘ day ’ , during which different parts of the surface are subjected to sunlight			0
one prominent and intriguing feature is a 1,640ft ( 500m ) long crack seen roughly parallel to the neck of the comet , running between its two larger lobes at either end			0
steep regions of the exposed cliff faces have also revealed features known as ‘ goosebumps ’ , small lumpy areas , but their origin is not yet known			0
are these icy alcoves ? the colour composite on the left shows material 20 per cent brighter and bluer than the surrounding area ( at a and b ) , which may be evidence of exposed ice			0
on the right , bright , highly reflective metre - sized boulders ( c ) and fracturing ( @entity194 ) are seen this @entity70 image was acquired on 22 november 2014 from a distance of 19 miles ( 30km ) from the comet			0
the image resolution is 9.2ft ( 2.8 metres ) per pixel			0
the nucleus is deliberately overexposed in order to reveal the faint jets of activity this @entity70 narrow - angle camera image shows part of a large fracture running across @entity209 ’s neck , in particular where it has left @entity31 and is extending into @entity210			2
in this orientation , the @entity211 is at the uppermost left and @entity214 in the lower left the biggest question remaining about the comet , though , is how it formed			0
two predominant theories remain : either it is the result of two smaller bodies ‘ sticking ’ together , forming a single comet , or its central neck has been eaten away over time like the core of an apple			0
the latter theory is supported by the observation of numerous jets ejecting material from the comet ’s neck			0
images from the cameras have shown an increase in the amount of dust flowing away from the comet in the past six months			2
the comet has also been producing increasing amounts of water from ice melting on its surface , from 0.3 litres per second in early june 2014 to 1.2 litres per second by late august			1
as the comet approaches the sun , @entity4 scientists are expecting to see more ‘ outgassing ’ from the surface as the temperature increases			1
this close - up shows a curious surface texture nicknamed ‘ goosebumps ’			0
the characteristic scale of all the bumps seen on the comet is approximately ten feet ( three metres ) , extending over regions greater than 330ft ( 100m )			0
they are seen on very steep slopes and on exposed cliff faces , but their formation mechanism is yet to be explained this wide - angle view of @entity131 – @entity11 was taken by @entity70 on 12 september 2014			0

@entity25 and @entity27 scientists have revealed amazing new images of comet @entity12 / @entity11
taken by the @entity4 spacecraft , the images reveal huge cliffs and ice on the surface of the comet
large amounts of dust have also been spotted in the images , in addition to cracks in the comet 's neck
in total 70 per cent of the comet 's surface has now been imaged , with the rest still shrouded in darkness
scientists will be hoping for more photo *opportunities* when the closest approach to the sun is made in august
