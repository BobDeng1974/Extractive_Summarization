by @entity0 published : 16:00 est , 27 june 2012 updated : 06:10 est , 29 june 2012 plans for a @entity3 race on the streets of @entity5 , which would see cars roaring at up to 200mph around some of the city 's most famous landmarks , will be unveiled tonight			1
drivers including @entity13 stars @entity11 and @entity14 would start from a grid outside @entity16 and race around a 3.2 - mile @entity19 circuit taking in sights such as @entity21 and @entity22			1
@entity3 chief executive @entity23 is said to have offered to pay more than £ 35million to stage the grand prix in the capital			1
he said : ‘ think what it would do for tourism			0
it would be fantastic — good for @entity5 , good for @entity43 — a lot better than the @entity45			0
’ should @entity5 host a @entity3 street race ? mr @entity23 , 81 , has long wanted @entity5 to host a grand prix , having seen the huge potential after a @entity3 demonstration event on @entity50 in 2004 attracted thousands to watch @entity14 and another @entity13 former world champion , @entity51 , in action			1
he said that he was prepared to promote the race , which is likely to be staged in the summer and is expected to generate as much as £ 100million in takings from spectators and tourists			1
the cost of hosting a @entity36 runs to millions of pounds , but mr @entity23 believes a @entity5 race would be so popular that it would pay for itself			1
the event , to be called the @entity60 , could even be held a night to help create what planners believe will be a ' carnival atmosphere '			0
@entity5 mayor @entity64 gave qualified support today to the plans			2
mr @entity64 said he was ' broadly positive ' about the plan as long as air quality and noise issues were addressed			0
speaking as he launched a new cable car system across the @entity71 in @entity5 today , the mayor said : ' i am always interested in projects that attract jobs and bring growth			0
' he said it was important to see if there was ' a really good economic case ' for a @entity32			0
mr @entity64 went on : ' the question of air quality and noise impact will have to be looked at			0
i am broadly positive providing we can satisfy the air quality and noise issues			0
' ont he grid : the proposed track would begin and end on the mall champions : @entity13 drivers @entity11 ( left ) and @entity14 ( right ) are believed to have been involved in designing the circuit , while @entity3 chief executive @entity23 ( right ) is said to have offered to pay more than £ 35million to stage the grand prix in the capital the race was originally proposed by the @entity96 bank , which sponsors the @entity13 @entity36 at @entity97			1
it would not take place for several years and is expected to complement , rather than replace , the annual @entity97 meeting			0
@entity96 spokesman @entity101 told @entity102 : ' there 's a tremendous appetite for @entity3 in the @entity13 - more than anywhere else - and @entity5 is more than capable of hosting world class events whether they be the marathon , the jubilee or rock concerts in @entity110			1
' putting a temporary @entity3 circuit into a city like @entity5 would involve serious challenges , but every single one has been met			2
' @entity11 and @entity14 are believed to have been involved in the design of the proposed circuit , which would see drivers racing at full throttle for three - quarters of each lap. the course would begin on @entity121 outside @entity16 , turning towards @entity122 before heading on towards the @entity124 hotel			1
iconic : the houses of @entity126 would be part of the dramatic backdrop to the race sightseeing : the proposed @entity3 race in @entity5 would be contested on a circuit taking in landmarks such as @entity22 the drivers would race at 180mph on a straight along @entity22 to a corner near the @entity136 on @entity137			1
cars would then come back past @entity16 to another straight along @entity140 to @entity141			0
the closing stages of the circuit would take in the @entity144 , @entity145 and @entity146 , ending back on the @entity121 where the race began			0
@entity148 , director of leading sports agency @entity149 , told the @entity150 that takings at the event could be double or even treble the £ 100million estimate			0
he said : ' it could be a commercial bonanza for @entity3 and @entity5			2
a successful @entity45 will show that there is an appetite for big events and bringing a grand prix to the people on their doorstep will attract massive attention			2
' last week a company called @entity163 revealed plans for a @entity32 around the @entity166 site but mr @entity23 insisted he knew nothing about the proposal			2
lucrative : the race is likely to be staged in the summer and is expected to generate as much as £ 100million in takings from spectators and tourists			1
