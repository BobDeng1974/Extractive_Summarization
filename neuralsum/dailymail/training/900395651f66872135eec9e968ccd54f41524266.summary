by @entity0 last updated at 1:19 am on 8th october 2011 jailed : @entity1 , the son of a company director , admitted battering graduate @entity3 to death a 6ft 2in man battered a petite business analyst to death as she walked home from work and then calmly ordered fish and chips			1
sentencing 19 - stone @entity1 to 28 years in jail for the murder of six - stone @entity3 , a judge asked the hushed courtroom : ‘ can you imagine a more unequal contest ? ’ he said the economics graduate ’s final moments as she walked along a woodland path known as the @entity21 must have been ones of ‘ abject terror ’			1
the injuries she suffered were so horrific that a pathologist compared them to those suffered in a car accident or a fall from a tall building			0
following the brutal killing , tattooed @entity1 then buried her body under logs and rocks before leaving to calmly order a fish and chip dinner from his local shop			1
the former @entity40 worker even pretended to friends at the shop that the scratches on his arms and face were caused after he got into a pub brawl to ‘ protect a girl ’			0
mrs @entity3 ’s body was found three days later by a mountain rescue dog following an intensive search of the local area			1
the 25 - year - old , who had been to see a doctor to discuss starting a family shortly before her death , was described in court as ‘ conscientious , determined and focused ’ with ‘ every prospect of a successful career ’			0
in contrast , @entity1 was staying at the homes of various friends after a fall - out with his parents , and had taken out a £ 30 crisis loan from his local @entity65 on the day he killed the young woman			1
@entity67 heard @entity1 , 21 , claimed to have ‘ panicked ’ while attempting to rob mrs @entity3 , possibly after she fought back or recognised him			1
the pair lived in the same area and @entity1 had been employed at @entity40 as a seasonal @entity71 worker twice in the past			1
but judge @entity73 said her horrific injuries , including a ruptured heart , suggested a ‘ sinister motive ’ and ‘ dangerous hidden aspects ’ to the 21 - year - old			1
@entity80 and @entity3 on their wedding day in @entity83 : he called her his ' @entity84 ' the hearing was also told that police had suspected a sexual motive for the attack , but there was no forensic evidence to back the claim			1
judge @entity92 added that @entity1 had robbed mrs @entity3 and her husband @entity80 , 26 , of a ‘ golden future ’ together in a ‘ most cruel and wicked manner ’			1
jailing @entity1 for life , with a recommendation he serve at least 28 years before being considered for release , he added : ‘ you have pleaded guilty very late in the day to a truly terrible crime that has left @entity3 ’s husband and family utterly devastated			1
‘ you have visited immense shock on your own family			0
they can simply not imagine what you have done			0
‘ had your motive been only robbery , given the huge disparity in size and weight , you would have had a simple task of relieving her of the few pounds she had in her possession			0
‘ i am satisfied that , whatever the motive , you intended to kill her			0
’ relief : @entity80 is accompanied by his mother @entity120 and detective superintendent @entity121 outside court after @entity1 pleaded guilty to murder detectives leading the investigation said the attack on mrs @entity3 , who was on her way home along a woodland path known as the @entity21 , was a chance attack and @entity1 did his best to conceal the murder			1
he covered her body with twigs and branches and scattered her belongings around @entity136 immediately after the murder			0
mrs @entity3 , who graduated from @entity138 with an economics degree , was eventually found by a mountain search and rescue dog on march 13 , three days after she vanished			2
@entity1 has refused to offer any explanation for the attack , although police say there may have been a ‘ sexual element ’ to the fatal assault			2
while mrs @entity3 had not been sexually assaulted , her clothing had been pulled up , exposing her abdomen , where ‘ contact ’ dna was recovered			2
her purse was also empty , suggesting robbery as a possible motive for the attack following @entity1 ’s guilty plea , it can be revealed that he had temporary jobs at @entity40 over the last two @entity71 periods , though police do not believe he met mrs @entity3 or her music teacher husband			1
murder : mrs @entity162 ( left ) disappeared after leaving work on march 10			0
@entity1 ( right ) murdered her in what police described as a ' sustained and brutal attack ' mrs @entity3 suffered severe injuries and broken ribs and died of a compression to the chest , which caused her heart to fatally rupture			1
her shoulder bag was found 15ft up in the branches of a tree			0
five buttons from her coat were also scattered nearby			0
also discarded in the woods were her glasses , mp3 player and damaged mobile phone			0
tragically , mrs @entity3 had rowed with her husband in the days leading up to her death , causing to him to briefly move out of the home they shared in @entity186 , @entity187 , close to the @entity40 headquarters where she worked			2
in a heart - rending twist , she left a conciliatory voicemail message for @entity80 , saying they should ‘ do something nice ’ that evening - but he did n’t listen to it until the next day , after she had been killed			2
mr @entity194 , a junior school teacher and private piano tutor , had been an early suspect in the murder after he had been filmed on @entity198 booking into a local @entity199 around the time his wife disappeared			0
this @entity187 police handout shows how mrs @entity3 's belongings , including an umbrella cover and coat buttons , were found scattered near her body this map shows where objects were found in relation to mrs @entity3 's body ( white dot ) he told police he spent a night at the hotel after a fall - out with his wife			1
but the row had ‘ not been serious ’ and he said he had just needed to ‘ give @entity3 some space ’			2
when he returned home from work the following evening , on march 10 this year , he discovered the house was empty and reported her missing			0
the 26 - year - old was arrested and quizzed by police before being eventually cleared of any involvement in her death			0
shortly after ruling him out , detectives became convinced the killer was a local after receiving several witness reports of a scruffy man acting suspiciously in the 50 - acre @entity136 around the time she was attacked			0
tragic : the couple , left , married in @entity83 in 2006			0
right , mr @entity194 pictured after @entity1 admitted to murdering the wife he called his ' @entity84 ' tragedy : mr @entity194 ( right ) carries his wife 's coffin in june 2011 at @entity238 in @entity239 , @entity187 from the descriptions , police decided there was a strong possibility the wanted man was a vagrant and obtained from the local council a list of the registered homeless			1
it included @entity1 , whose fingerprints and dna matched that found on her belongings recovered from the scene			2
it was a vital breakthrough as @entity1 , who had no previous convictions , was not on the police ’s national dna database			2
@entity1 initially pleaded not guilty to mrs @entity3 ’s murder and was due to go on trial on november 1			1
but he changed his plea at @entity67 last week			0
following that hearing , mr @entity194 released a statement ‘ for the family of @entity3 ’ in which he said : ‘ i hope that justice will be done and that this despicable being will never be free to kill again			2

@entity3 's heart was crushed and ruptured by 19 stone @entity1
