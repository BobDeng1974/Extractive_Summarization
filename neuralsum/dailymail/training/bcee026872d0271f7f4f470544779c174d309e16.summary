one - year survival rates for non-small cell lung cancer - the most common form of the disease - are not as good as those in @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 , according to a study published in the journal @entity19			1
survival rates for one year ranged from 30 % in the @entity3 to 46 % in @entity16			1
@entity12 and @entity13 reported one - year survival rates of 42 % , while @entity14 had 34 % and @entity15 had 39 %			1
the study , conducted by the @entity23 , examined data concerning 57,000 lung cancer patients diagnosed between 2004 and 2007			0
it examined survival rates and what stage of cancer the patients were at when they were diagnosed			0
in @entity14 and the @entity3 only one in seven patients with non-small cell lung cancer were diagnosed at the earliest stage of disease , compared with one in five in @entity16 and @entity13			2
one - year survival for patients with the earliest stage disease in the @entity3 was 72.5 % - 16 % lower than in @entity16			2
@entity39 , director of early diagnosis at @entity41 , said : ' this research should remind us that while great progress is being made in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer in the @entity3 , we must n’t be complacent			0
' around 35,000 people still die from lung cancer each year in the @entity3 and that ’s far too many			0
we would like to see ongoing improvements in data collection and the use of uniform systems for data on stage , in order to improve the accuracy of global comparisons			0
' one - year survival for patients with the earliest stage disease in the @entity3 was 72.5 % - 16 % lower than in @entity16			2

@entity3 lags behind countries like @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14
survival rates are 16 per cent lower than @entity16
