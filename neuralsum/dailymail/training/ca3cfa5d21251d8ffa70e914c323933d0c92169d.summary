it was one of the most star - studded weddings of the year and since tying the knot to @entity4 in a three - day wedding extravaganza , @entity2 has secured her status as one of the world 's favourite style icons			2
and now , one artist has celebrated mrs @entity13 's wardrobe in a rather bizarre way - by immortalising her as a @entity15			2
the @entity17 - born lawyer , who has shot from relative obscurity to most envied woman in the world overnight , wowed with a wedding wardrobe packed with the likes of @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25 , which @entity27 @entity26 has captured in a series of illustrations			1
the series includes her stunning selection of designer looks from @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity57			1
and , of course , she can be seen in her bespoke @entity23 for her marriage to mr @entity4			0
all white ! @entity62 looked chic in @entity57 tailored , wide - leg trousers and a navy and cream top as she made her union to mr @entity4 official on monday - and there she is rocking the look as a @entity15 , right colourful creation : the lawyer wore a beautifully ornate @entity73 minidress for her first appearance as mrs @entity13 on sunday , which the @entity27 artist has re-imagined , right the @entity78 lace gown was embroidered with diamante and pearls and featured a circular train , while the wide neckline scooped just off her shoulders			1
he has also included the look she wore the day after her wedding - Â£ 450 @entity57 tailored , wide - leg trousers and a navy and cream top , both of which were bespoke , of course			2
the day before she wore the weekend 's most colourful creation - a @entity73 minidress , which she wore for her first appearance as mrs @entity13 on sunday , as seen in the quirky illustrations			2
at the glamorous pre-wedding dinner , she took a tip from @entity97 royalty and wore a custom - made dress by @entity55 , the same designer that the @entity99 wore for her actual wedding			1
@entity102 hot ! for her pre-wedding dinner , @entity62 wore custom - made @entity55 , which also featured a high - low hemline the eye - catching scarlet gown , which perfectly complemented @entity62 's dark hair and eyes , was adapted from a @entity110 collection design , which @entity111 wore to a state dinner in 2011			1
@entity26 's previous work includes giving the @entity99 a similar makeover and also recreating @entity116 princesses as disabled and as victims of domestic abuse on his blog @entity121			0
speaking about @entity62 's wardrobe , fashion writer @entity122 said : ' @entity62 is surely now the first lady of @entity125 ? she has got the high - profile hubby , has her own amazing career , will now of course be enlisted to help with charities and has the most incredible designer wardrobe			0
' she has given us a glimpse of what to expect from her when dressing for occasions in the space of a few days : her monochrome @entity24 arrival outfit demonstrates her ultra chic travelling wardrobe , the stand - out red @entity55 dress was sexy eveningwear done to perfection , the post-wedding @entity56 couture mini-dress shows how she does short and sassy , and the trouser - and - top combo for their civil ceremony was her answer to chic , well - tailored , classic dressing			1
' women will want her wardrobe , and they will try to emulate her looks			0
she 's aspirational and has proven to be a style icon in the making , always wearing the clothes rather than them wearing her			0
she wears couture exactly as it 's meant to be worn - fitted down to the last millimetre and with confidence			0
' look who it is ! the happy new mr and mrs @entity13 can be seen in a romantic embrace on a boat named @entity165 as @entity166 drives them into the distance			0
