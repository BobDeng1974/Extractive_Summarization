by @entity0 published : 22:26 est , 27 june 2013 updated : 22:28 est , 27 june 2013 for years a blurry picture of a woman posing with a parasol was believed to be @entity5 , the slave turned @entity7 spy during the civil war			1
but after several years of researching the elusive spy , who worked undercover as a slave in the @entity12 @entity11 , a historian and novelist has revealed the truth behind the picture			1
as @entity18 researched her historical novel @entity20 of @entity5 , she was intrigued by the only image said to be of the @entity7 spy			1
mystery : for years this picture of a woman named @entity5 was believed to be of a @entity7 spy few details are known about the @entity28 woman , who was freed by the @entity30 family in @entity31 , @entity32 , who sent her to the @entity34 to be educated			1
the @entity36 era diary of the @entity7 spy @entity37 recalls how an @entity28 named @entity5 had been a vital source of information			1
about 50 years after the war , which ran between 1861 and 1865 , @entity30 's niece identified the woman as @entity5			1
' @entity5 was exceptionally intelligent , and displayed some acting skills , ' according to @entity44			2
' hoping to gain access to secret information , she became “ @entity47 ” , a dim - witted , crazy , but very able servant			0
' because slaves were assumed to be illiterate and background characters , @entity5 was able to listen in on vital conversations by @entity12 president @entity52 and his men			1
as she cleaned meeting rooms she was also able to examine documents and pass on details to the @entity30 family			0
clues : the original photograph was found to have been taken about 40 years after the @entity36 misleading : the woman in the photograph was named @entity5 , but the picture was not of the spy the first time a picture of @entity5 was linked to her stories of espionage was in 2002 , when a radio station 's website ran the photo , crediting it to ' @entity71 , @entity72 deputy , office of the chief , @entity73 '			1
but , as @entity18 researched her book she became suspicious of the authenticity of the picture			2
' my doubts about the image grew when i unearthed several post-war sources corroborating @entity5 's participation in the @entity31 espionage ring , ' she told the @entity83			1
' one of these documents indicates that in june of 1867 , the slave - turned - spy , then using the surname @entity88 , left the @entity89 for the @entity90 ; after that date , she disappears from the historical record			2
' @entity18 added that the dress and furniture in the photograph appeared to be from a later era			2
she finally traced the original picture to the @entity98 , where the origins of the photograph were stated as @entity101			0
@entity101 began taken the cabinet style of picture , like the one said to be of @entity5 , in 1860 , but did not open a studio in @entity104 , @entity32 , until 1880 , making it unlikely that the woman in the photo was the spy			1
a few months later , @entity18 was given the chance to view the original , which would finally confirm if the picture was of the spy			1
' this is the moment a historian lives for - cradling a rare primary source in hand			0
and it was just as informative as i 'd hoped , ' @entity18 said			0
historical fact : @entity18 tracked down the truth behind the picture after writing about @entity5 's life the back of the cabinet card captioned the photograph as @entity5 , and the name was repeated on the address on the back			1
but , the date of the photograph was 1900 , when @entity5 would have been about 60			0
@entity18 pointed out that whoever cropped the original photograph , when it started circulating on the internet as being the spy , had removed the critical date proving it was of the wrong person			2
she added that the lack of a picture of @entity5 was a valuable insight into @entity28 history			0
' @entity89 of all backgrounds contributed to our history			0
but the enormous holes in what we have of [ @entity5 's ] biography remind us that gender , race , and class also shaped how millions of @entity89 went unrecorded , ' she said			2
missing : @entity18 says the lack of a photograph is a reminder of how slaves were written out of history ' wanting to commemorate an @entity28 woman who played such a dramatic part in the @entity36 is laudable			0
expecting to have a photograph of her was borderline ludicrous			0
' in 1995 the government honored @entity5 's efforts by inducting her in the @entity164 hall of fame			2
her efforts were described as : ' a highly dangerous mission to the great benefit of the @entity7 effort			0
she was one of the highest placed and most productive espionage agents of the @entity36			0
… @entity52 never discovered the leak in his household staff , although he knew the @entity7 somehow kept discovering @entity12 plans			0

@entity5 pretended to be a slave to get close to @entity12 president
@entity18 went in search of truth about spy 's only photo
