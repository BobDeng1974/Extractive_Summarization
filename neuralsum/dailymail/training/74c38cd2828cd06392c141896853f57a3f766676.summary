@entity0 managed to avoid their worst run in 57 years with a resounding victory against @entity3			1
an own goal from @entity5 in the first half set @entity0 on their way and strikes from @entity9 and @entity10 then secured victory and halted their dramatic slide			1
had they been beaten by the @entity15 club then they would have crashed to their sixth consecutive defeat , matching an unwanted run set in 1957			2
it was certainly a motivating factor for @entity20 ’s men			2

‘ i ’m a long time in football			0
the best medicine is to come back to playing like we did in the first part of the season			0
’ there was a sense of karma to the opener			0
referee @entity94 made several iffy calls in the first half and home fans were getting on his back , but the worst decision of the lot ended in a @entity0 goal			1
in the 37th minute @entity56 delivered a terrible backpass that @entity103 intercepted , only to be clearly taken down by @entity3 skipper @entity53			2
the referee gave a corner when , in fact , the defender got none of the ball and all of the man			0
from the resulting set - piece , however , @entity110 sent an expertly curled ball into the six - yard box and @entity5 headed into his own net			1
@entity3 manager @entity114 disagreed with the decision			2
‘ i felt it was n’t a corner , ’ he insisted			0
‘ it was never a corner			0
there was a debate it was a penalty , but @entity53 never saw @entity103 and was looking at the ball			0
@entity103 made the most of the contact ‘ for me it ’s not a penalty or a corner			0
i do n’t think the ref is to blame though , we are to blame for the defeat			0
‘ we were a little bit soft , done too easily with balls into the box			0
it ’s disappointing the way we defended our box			0
’ @entity0 striker @entity103 ( right ) vies for the ball with @entity3 central defender @entity52 in the early stages @entity0 manager @entity20 watches on during the first half at @entity139 on saturday afternoon @entity3 forward @entity56 ( left ) battles for possession with @entity0 's @entity39 @entity3 midfielder @entity55 ( right ) slides in to challenge @entity0 striker @entity9 @entity3 goalkeeper @entity29 looks on forlornly as he was beaten by his own player @entity5 @entity0 defender @entity22 holds his arm aloft in celebration after winning the header that led to the opener @entity3 's @entity149 midfielder @entity58 ( left ) vies for possession with @entity0 forward @entity39 @entity0 forward @entity9 puts the ball past @entity29 for his side 's second of the game @entity0 striker @entity9 ( right ) celebrates his goal with his team - mate @entity36 during the second half @entity0 defender @entity10 salutes the @entity24 's faithful after scoring their third of the game in a comfortable win @entity3 have developed a nasty habit of scoring own goals at @entity24 ’s			1
@entity5 ’s mishap was their third in a row , after @entity166 and @entity51 scored in their own net in @entity0 ’s 2 - 0 win in this fixture in april			1
it was the sort of luck a team in @entity0 ’s dire form @entity170 yet it always looked as though @entity0 would need to score at least one more to secure victory			1
and that moment came in the 65th minute when @entity9 finished from close range			2
@entity36 , in yet another brilliant performance down the right , picked out @entity103 with a cross who headed the ball down for @entity9 to poke it in			2
they would have gone even further ahead three minutes later had @entity29 not pulled off an outstanding stop to deny @entity22			0
@entity37 sent in another enticing delivery from a free - kick and @entity22 headed towards the right of goal , only for the @entity3 goalkeeper to keep it out at full stretch			1
but the game was put beyond doubt in the 82nd minute when @entity10 leapt to meet @entity192 ’ cross with the outside of his boot and sent the ball in via his shoulder			2
the manner of the last goal summed up @entity3 ’s afternoon			1
@entity39 , 19 , was handed his first @entity201 start and was a terrier in front of @entity0 ’s back four , shouldering huge responsibility for a teenager			0
‘ the key to win today was to win the battles in midfield and @entity39 was outstanding , ’ @entity20 added			1
‘ he showed a lot of energy and you need that to play and get the best out of yourself			0

@entity5 scores first own goal to set @entity0 on their way to victory against @entity3
@entity9 and @entity10 add to the score in the second half as @entity0 run out 3 - 0 winners
win for @entity20 's side brings an end to their five - match losing run in all *competitions*
