these shocking pictures show the horrible fate suffered by a greyhound which fell foul of the brutal @entity5 hunting industry			1
@entity6 was found starving and near death in a government - run pound after being discarded by his owner at the end of the hunting season			0
but a @entity14 sanctuary owner managed to nurse him back to health - and is now trying to extend the same treatment to the other animals caught up in the cruel trade			1
warning : graphic images danger : prince the greyhound was close to death when he was rescued by an animal sanctuary ill : the dog had to be nursed back to health due to his poor physical condition compassion : sanctuary owner @entity29 with @entity6 greyhounds , known as ' galgos ' , are used in @entity5 for hunting , but when the end of the season comes around their owners often decide they have no further need for them			1
campaigners believe that more than 50,000 dogs die or are abandoned each year thanks to the hunting industry			1
some are left to wander the landscape on their own , often starving to death or being killed in car accidents			0
others end up in government pounds , where they are given just a few weeks to find a new home before they are put down , and the dogs must fight each other for the food they are given			2
in some cases , hunters who are angry with their poorly performing dogs torture them by breaking their legs , hanging them from trees or throwing them down wells			0
beautiful : photographer @entity59 raised £ 2,000 through selling prints of this image happy home : ms @entity63 pictured with a number of the dogs at her sanctuary in @entity68 while @entity6 was not quite so unfortunate , he was in a very sorry state when @entity71 @entity63 , a @entity14 expat who runs a sanctuary in @entity68 , took him home from a pound			1
the magnificent animal was so emaciated his spine was jutting through his skin , and he was not expected to survive the night			0
but ms @entity63 's loving care helped @entity6 regain his strength , and within a couple of days he was wagging his tail again			0
the dog has now gained 2kg of weight , and the sanctuary is hoping to find him a permanent home in the near future			2
cheery : @entity6 's tail was still wagging despite his miserable condition at the time of his rescue neglect : around 50,000 dogs per year are abandoned at the end of the @entity5 hunting season grisly : @entity6 was so badly malnourished that his spine was jutting out of his pelt @entity6 's story has been highlighted by @entity59 , a photographer from @entity100 who is spending this year trying to save as many animals from torment as possible			1
he raised £ 2,000 for @entity6 's care by selling photographs of the beautiful dog , and hopes to help many more through his work			0
the urgency of efforts to help animals has been exacerbated by the recession , according to mr @entity59 , who says that sanctuaries in @entity5 have seen record numbers of cases this year .			2

@entity115 was nursed back to health at sanctuary and is now looking for a home
