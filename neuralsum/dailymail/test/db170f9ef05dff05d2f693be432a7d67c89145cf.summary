@entity0 is one signature away from telling poor families that it 's illegal to use their welfare payments to buy alcohol , tobacco and pornography , to visit strip clubs or tattoo shops , and to take vacation cruises or gamble on dog or horse races			1
swimming pools , jewelry and lingerie stores , psychics , movie theatre , nail salons , massage parlors , bars and theme parks will also be forbidden territory for the first time , if @entity24 gov. @entity24 signs a bill that hit his desk last week			1
the proposal would also give the force of state law to some of brownback 's policies , including one that requires ' temporary cash assistance ' recipients to hold down jobs , look for work or enroll in job training programs			1

@entity74 lawmakers complained that some welfare recipients use their debit cards to get funds for rent payments			1
democratic state sen. @entity79 told the @entity80 that forcing those people to make multiple trips to bank machines to pay their bills ' is ludicrous			0
' state rep. @entity86 , another @entity87 , complained during a legislative debate that putting limits on how the poor can spend taxpayer dollars says to them : ' if you are asking for assistance in this state , you 're sort of less than other people and we 're going to tell you how and where to spend your money			0
' @entity100 : @entity101 will be added to the no - no list , along with movie tickets , cruise vactions and lingerie i see a job in your future : fortune tellers and psychics ? out			1
conflict : @entity115 state rep. @entity0 state rep. @entity113 ( left ) insists that getting welfare recipients ' back to work ' justifies the new law , while state sen. @entity79 ( right ) called it ' ludicrous ' and ' outrageous ' but state sen. @entity120 , the @entity115 who gathered support for a @entity124 bill putting all the changes into place , said public assistance should be spent ' more responsibly ' than it had been in the past			1
' we ’re trying to make sure those benefits are used the way they were intended ' – on food and necessities like diapers or toiletries , @entity120 told the paper			0

when @entity24 became governor in 2011 , the program served 38,900 people statewide			2
today that number has dwindled to 15,500 , according to statistics compiled by the @entity152			0
numbers of food stamp recipients – a completely separate category of government welfare – have ticked down by just 6 per cent during the same period , however			2
poverty rates among children have remained constant , according to the social - services nonprofit group @entity159 the clash of statistics has raised questions about whether the state has actually been moving people off of @entity144 and into jobs			2
@entity166 ? benefits recipients were previously permitted to spend their government money to bail themselves and family members out of jail your tax dollars at work : until @entity24 became governor , welfare enrollees could buy liquor with their benefit debit cards , but now his policy is likely to become a law that future pols will find it hard to undo ' this is serious , good policy for the state of @entity0 , ' state rep. @entity113 , a @entity182 @entity115 , told the @entity185			1
' there 's nothing better to get these people back on their feet than getting them a job and getting them back to work			0
' but @entity194 state sen. @entity193 countered in the @entity80 that ' we pat ourselves on the back that our @entity144 rolls have gone down exponentially and we say it ’s because all those people are now working , ' but ' we do n’t know that and i ’m guessing its not the truth			1

' @entity144 ' funds can buy goods and services beyond food and necessities intended by program 's *designers*
tattoos , manicures , lingerie , jewelry , movie tickets , cruises and pornography will also be off the list if gov. @entity24 signs a bill
@entity115 in @entity0 also want to limit benefit recipients to $ 25 per day in cash withdrawals with their government - issued welfare debit cards
@entity194 say it 's mean - *spirited* and will make welfare enrollees think they 're ' less ' *valuable* ' than other people '
@entity24 's administration has *shrunk* the @entity144 rolls by 60 per cent since 2011 ; the law would also force recipients to try to find work
