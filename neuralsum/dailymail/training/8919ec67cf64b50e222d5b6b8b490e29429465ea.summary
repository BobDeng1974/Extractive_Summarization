ever had one of those days when you feel like you 're taking one step forward and two steps back ? this man , filmed outside a pub in @entity6 , east @entity7 , clearly is familiar with the expression , as this bizarre video clip shows			1
the man , who appears to have been drinking , is seen attempting to walk forwards , only to find himself drifting backwards every time			2
he is also seen shuffling forwards and backwards in a square shape and at one point leans right back , hovering just inches from the floor before he is able to right himself and return to an upright position			0
eventually , after around two minutes , the apparent struggle to get anywhere proves too much , and the man slumps to the ground next to the gate			0
the footage was shot by @entity42 , 33 , who had been out to celebrate a friend 's birthday in july when he spotted the stranger across the road , and started filming him			2
