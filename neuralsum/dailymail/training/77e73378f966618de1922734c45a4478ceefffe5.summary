@entity0 will say government reforms led to almost £ 50billion of savings in a speech today @entity5 's benefits system is growing at the slowest rate since the inception of the welfare state , @entity0 will say today			1
the @entity9 will point to almost £ 50billion of savings for the taxpayer thanks to government reforms			1
he will hail a ‘ momentous reversal of @entity18 ’s reckless spending ’ and claim that the lives of hundreds of thousands of people have been ‘ transformed ’ by pushing them into work			1
despite @entity18 ’s claim that austerity measures would cost a million jobs , there are 1.75million more people in work , and 700,000 fewer people in workless households , he will say			1
mr @entity0 will attack the ‘ accepted wisdom of the @entity27 : that poverty is solely about money , and more state money solves it ’			2
the @entity9 ’s intervention comes as the election battleground moves on to welfare and with @entity18 ’s work and pensions spokesman today accusing the @entity38 of failing on the issue			1
@entity40 will claim the stagnation of wages over much of this parliament has meant more people in work becoming reliant on the state			1
she will say that by 2020 , the number of working people depending on housing benefit to meet the costs of their home will have more than doubled , at a cost of over £ 14billion			2
former @entity18 work and pensions secretary @entity53 is expected to unveil his own proposals for welfare reform , including curbs on benefits paid to better - off pensioners			1
but mr @entity0 , speaking at the free market @entity60 , will attack @entity18 for opposing every one of the government ’s measures to cut the welfare bill			1
@entity18 allowed welfare bills to ‘ spiral out of control ’ , having rocketed by 60 per cent in real terms , he will say			1
‘ now , welfare spending is under control , seeing the first real terms fall for 16 years			0
the independent @entity72 estimates the cost of welfare next year will be nearly £ 17billion lower thanks to our reforms			1
’ controversial measures introduced by the @entity78 include freezes on uprating of benefits , tax credits and public sector pensions to the less generous @entity85 measure of inflation , the removal of child benefit from better - off families and a £ 26,000 household benefit cap			0
mr @entity0 ’s analysis suggests £ 50billion will have been saved cumulatively over the course of this parliament , from 2010 to 2015			2
‘ we had to get spending under control – for under the last government , welfare expenditure had increased on a trajectory that was entirely unsustainable by 2010 , costing every household in @entity5 an extra £ 3,000 a year , ’ mr @entity0 will say			1
‘ yet it was not enough simply to top - slice the budget			0
to do so would be equally unsustainable in the long - term , for problems would simply accumulate further down the line or emerge elsewhere – with consequences for the health system , the justice system and more			0
‘ rather in its true sense , welfare reform is about transforming the life chances and outcomes of those on benefits – bringing down the cost of social failure in the process			0
’ the government ’s reforms have been designed so the state is ‘ no longer just putting money in , maintaining people in dependency ’ , but tying spending to improved outcomes			2
back - to - work providers are paid by results , depending on how long someone moving from benefits into a job keeps it			0
and the new universal credit , which is gradually replacing all the main out - of - work benefits and tax credits , is designed to bring about ‘ a complete shift in the welfare culture ’			2
it ensures it always pays for people to move into a job and take more hours , while allowing the state to place new requirements on claimants			0
@entity18 's @entity40 will claim the stagnation of wages over much of this parliament has meant more people in work becoming reliant on the state ‘ gone are the days when it makes more sense to sit on benefits than enter work , ’ mr @entity0 will say			1
a welfare system that ‘ can catch you when you fall , lift you when you can rise ’ is the ‘ strongest statement yet of this government ’s commitment to helping people get on ’ , he will argue			2
despite the progress , mr @entity0 will warn that the ‘ disparity between the top and bottom of society is in many cases larger than it has ever been ’			2
‘ we have a group of skilled professionals and wealth creators at the top of society who have little or no connection to those at the bottom , ’ he will say			0
‘ yet in so many cases what divides the two is little more than a different start in life			0
i believe social investment gives us an opportunity to lock not just wealth back into our most disadvantaged areas – but something else as well			0
’ mr @entity0 will urge the wealthy and big firms to put money into ‘ social enterprises ’ in deprived neighbourhoods			0
miss @entity40 is expected to say : ‘ the government ’s failure to make work pay has meant they are struggling to keep social security spending under control			0
‘ last week the @entity72 confirmed that , for all @entity196 and @entity197 ’s rhetoric , social security spending will be no lower next year than it was when @entity196 took office			0

@entity0 will say that government reforms led to £ 50bn savings
he will claim people have been ' transformed ' by pushing them into work
there is 1.75million more people in work despite @entity18 's austerity claims
his intervention comes as election battleground moves on to welfare
