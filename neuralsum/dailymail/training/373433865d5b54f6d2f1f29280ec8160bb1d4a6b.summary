by @entity0 published : 17:02 est , 8 may 2013 updated : 18:54 est , 8 may 2013 curbs on immigrants ’ access to benefits , the @entity1 and housing unveiled in the @entity3 prompted a storm of controversy last night			0
@entity10 said a crowd - pleasing package of measures would ‘ attract people who will contribute ’ but ‘ deter those who will not ’ , and hailed other moves to help ordinary families as evidence that the government is ‘ standing up for hard - working people ’			1
but @entity21 suggested one proposal – to require landlords to check the immigration status of tenants – risked encouraging racism , while others insisted doctors and property owners should not be made to do the work of immigration officials			1
scroll down for @entity34 's speech highlights regal : @entity34 accompanied by prince @entity35 , the @entity35 , prince @entity36 , and @entity37 at the @entity38 at the @entity39 support : prince @entity36 sits next to the @entity34 in the @entity41 as she announces 20 bills which her government hopes to pass in the coming year concentration : as his mother reads her speech today , @entity36 and his second wife listen intently to the proposed legislation she announced loyal : her majesty was accompanied as usual by @entity35 , but the @entity34 is understood to be concerned not to put too much strain on her husband , who will be 92 next month the @entity54 said @entity55 were not prepared to act as a new ‘ border agency ’ policing access to healthcare			1
some of the measures , including a six - month time limit on benefit claims , a local residency test for council house access and a residency requirement before accessing civil legal aid , will be in place within months			2
but those requiring full - scale legislation , including measures to ensure temporary migrants or their governments are made to pay for using the @entity1 and requirements on landlords and employers to check the status of tenants and employees , are unlikely to be in place in time for january			1
that is when controls on @entity82 and @entity83 incomers will be lifted			0
regal : a smiling @entity34 leaves through the @entity84 of the @entity39 having given her speech to the assembled lords and @entity87 today departure : the @entity34 and @entity35 are then led away as the head back to the @entity39 this afternoon exit : the grinning monarch looks pleased that her speech over , as a pleased @entity36 and @entity37 are taken home by carriage iconic : the famous outline of the @entity34 after she announced the government would impose a fresh clampdown on immigration yesterday 's @entity3 was billed as an attempt by the government finally to get tough on immigration			1
health secretary @entity101 said the intention was to remove the ‘ pull factors ’ to @entity104			2
here , our @entity106 editor examines the planned legislation			0
deter illegals plan : blitz on firms who use illegal labour			1
current fines of £ 10,000 per worker ‘ substantially ’ increased			2
law changed to ban illegals from holding a driving licence			0
will it work ? only if businesses think they will be caught			2
the number of employers prosecuted was only 1,215 last year – down from 2,092 in 2010			2
does nothing to deter the supposed target of @entity10 ’s crackdown – the @entity82 and @entity83 who gain free access to the labour market in january			2
at best , it will reduce net migration by convincing people currently working in the black economy to go home			2
@entity1 plan : force temporary migrants to make a contribution to the cost of their healthcare			2
ask @entity140 nationals to pay a bond before travelling to @entity104			2
ask health staff to check a migrant is here legally			1
will it work ? nurses and doctors are livid at the idea of being asked to conduct immigration checks			2
@entity150 leaders said they ‘ have a duty of care to all people ’			1
identifying migrants who should pay for care is very different from being able to recover the money , once they have received emergency treatment			1
critics say the only way to solve the problem is to introduce an entitlement card			0
private @entity163 plan : force private landlords to check the immigration status of their tenants or risk huge fines			1
will it work ? was already descending into a shambles last night with ministers unable to explain how it would work			0
there are two million buy - to - let landlords in the private sector			1
expecting them to guess who might be an illegal migrant on sight is fraught with difficulty			0
civil liberties groups claim the plan could amount to discrimination – with legal challenges expected			0
large numbers of forged documents in circulation could quickly render the checks meaningless			0
and some critics say the measures will be limited in effectiveness as illegal migrants could be living in sub-let social housing , sleeping on friends ’ floors or in garden sheds			0
@entity197 plan : restrict appeals in immigration cases			1
change law to stop foreign criminals using article 8 of the @entity204 – the right to a family life – to thwart deportation attempts in the @entity104 courts			1
will it work ? the simplest and potentially most effective aspect of the crackdown			0
the danger , however , is that @entity214 – which has shown limited interest in article 8 – will itself begin intervening on family - life grounds			0
solving this problem would require withdrawing from the @entity220			0
@entity221 access to benefits plan : @entity225 migrants of out - of - work benefits after six months if they are not on the verge of getting a job will it work ? not in @entity34 ’s speech but will be introduced at a later stage			1
@entity21 say it is a con as existing @entity235 guidelines state migrants must be ‘ genuinely seeking work , and have a reasonable chance of being engaged ’ if they wish to continue receiving @entity38 handouts			0
@entity241 regulations say the same thing			0
so , while it sounds tough , the impact is likely to be limited.although the @entity3 , which included 15 bills and signalled four others , was finalised before @entity249 ’s surge in last week ’s council elections , the focus on immigration is seen as a response to public concerns which the @entity254 party has successfully exploited			1
the @entity34 told @entity87 and peers that her government ’s top priority remained the economy			1
but she said an @entity259 will aim to ‘ ensure that this country attracts people who will contribute and deter those who will not ’			0
measures will regulate migrant access to the @entity1 , with incomers expected to be given temporary rather than permanent @entity1 numbers and charged for access to all but emergency treatment			0
there will also be steps to prevent illegal immigrants from obtaining driving licences , bigger fines for businesses using illegal labour and a requirement on private landlords to check the immigration status of tenants			1
the @entity259 will make it easier to remove people from the @entity104 , limiting rights to appeal against deportation			0
access to benefits will also be limited , and clearer priority given to long - term local residents in social housing queues			0
pageantry : two boys help with the the @entity34 's parliamentary robe as she prepares to take a seat and give her annual address audience : peers watch her majesty as she prepares to give her 2013 @entity34 's speech in the @entity298 , mr @entity10 said : ‘ put simply , our @entity259 will back aspiration and end the legacy of the last government where people could come here and expect something for nothing			1
’ he said the legislation was vital as @entity21 had left a system which was ‘ out of control ’ , with around a third of the ‘ skilled ’ migrants who came to the @entity104 under @entity21 having ended up ‘ in low - skilled roles working in takeaways or as security guards ’			0
the prime minister added : ‘ our determination to end the last government ’s something - for - nothing culture is also why we continue to pursue our welfare reforms – every one of them is about making sure work pays			1
’ he pointed out that @entity21 leader @entity322 had ordered his mps to vote against the £ 26,000 benefit cap and the one per cent freeze on annual benefits increases			0
‘ we are standing up for hard - working people , ’ he said			1
‘ this is a @entity34 ’s speech that will back aspiration and those who want to get on			1
’ the @entity332 is carried on a cushion as it arrives for the @entity38 prince @entity36 touches his cap as he and @entity37 , @entity37 , walk through @entity335 dramatic : the @entity34 and the @entity35 walk up the stairs towards the @entity41 flanked by the @entity338 her majesty is led by the hand into the chamber by her 92 - year - old husband prince @entity35 , the @entity35 mr @entity322 insisted the @entity343 was doing nothing to boost growth , cut youth unemployment or tackle rising living costs and was a ‘ tired and failing government ’			1
‘ out of touch , out of ideas , standing up for the wrong people and unable to bring the change the country needs , ’ he added			0
attacking mr @entity10 ’s attempt to win back some of those who voted @entity249 in last week ’s elections , mr @entity322 said : ‘ they used to call them clowns			0
now they want to join the circus			0
’ @entity21 ’s housing spokesman @entity362 said : ‘ tackling illegal immigration must not take us back to the days when my @entity366 father was turned away from boarding houses displaying “ no dogs , no @entity366 ” signs			2
’ dr @entity370 , head of the @entity54 , said : ‘ whilst the health system must not be abused and we must bring an end to health tourism , it is important that we do not overestimate the problem and that gps are not placed in the invidious position of being the new border agency			0
’ @entity379 , of the @entity381 law firm @entity380 , said : ‘ expecting landlords to carry out the work of immigration officials is unreasonable and unworkable			1
’ @entity34 rides in a carriage to the @entity39			2
she has only missed two state openings since 1952 , because she was pregnant event : the @entity34 starts her trip from @entity389 this morning , accompanied by @entity390 , which travelled in its own carriage in front of her on their way : prince @entity36 and @entity37 ride in a carriage to the @entity39 for the @entity38 of @entity396 nimble : the 91 - yar - old @entity35 climbs out of the state coach as it arrives at @entity39 chivalrous : prince @entity35 then waits for his wife and helps her down before they took the steps up into the building march : the men head for the vaults to search for explosives , after the event was targeted by @entity409 , who tried to kill @entity410 members of the @entity412 undergo last - minute checks at the houses of @entity335 this afternoon waiting : judges sit in the @entity41 as they wait for the start of the state opening of @entity335			1
