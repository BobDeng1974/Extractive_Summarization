' his video clip followed the pleas of two @entity21 journalists who are asking to be airlifted from @entity30 as quickly as possible			1
@entity21 journalist @entity34 's leg was badly broken in wednesdays attack , which also killed photographer @entity58			1
@entity59 writer ms @entity34 posted a video , alongside colleague @entity46 , asking for a temporary ceasefire so she can be taken out to receive treatment			1
she said : ' i need to undergo surgery as soon as possible			0
the doctors have treated us very well here , and have done the best they could , but they are unable to perform surgery			0
' the pleas came as government troops continued to shell rebel - held areas in central @entity30 today , killing at least five people			1
they died in renewed shelling of the @entity75 neighbourhood of @entity75 , the latest of hundreds killed there in recent weeks			1
the neighbourhood , under siege and intense shelling for three weeks , has become the centre of the revolt			0

@entity4 is to recognise the @entity110 opposition as a ' legitimate representative ' of the country 's people , @entity108 said today			1
the foreign secretary made the comment as he arrived in @entity116 for talks on the response to brutal repression by @entity110 president @entity88 's regime			1
he said the international community had to ' tighten the diplomatic and economic stranglehold ' on the @entity110 government , amid growing concern over bloodshed in @entity75 and other cities			1
he said : ' we will intensify our links with the opposition			0
i will meet leaders of the @entity132 in a few minutes ' time , before the main meeting takes place			0
' we , in common with other nations , will now treat them and recognise them as a legitimate representative of the @entity110 people			2
' mr @entity108 denounced @entity88 's government as ' a criminal regime '			2
but he indicated that @entity4 is not contemplating sending arms to the @entity110 opposition , as some people have demanded			2
it said the town was being shelled and reported heavy clashes between troops and army defectors who destroyed two armoured personnel carriers			0
the renewed violence comes as the @entity151 , @entity152 and @entity154 nations meet in @entity116 to seek ways to ease the crisis			0
more than 70 countries will participate in today 's @entity30 meeting , which is expected to press @entity88 to agree to a ceasefire and allow humanitarian aid to reach the areas that have been hardest - hit by his security forces			1
in the run up to the conference , @entity151 , @entity152 and @entity154 officials said the group would be likely to impose harsher sanctions if @entity88 rejects the ceasefire and predicted that his opponents would grow stronger if he remained in power			0
before the meeting , @entity151 secretary of state @entity171 suggested @entity30 's opposition will ultimately arm itself and said she would bet against @entity88 staying in power			1
she said : ' the strategy followed by the @entity110 and their allies is one that ca n't stand the test of legitimacy or even brutality for any length of time			2
' there will be increasingly capable opposition forces			0
they will from somewhere , somehow , find the means to defend themselves as well as begin offensive measures			0
' it is clear to me there will be a breaking point			0
i wish it would be sooner , so that more lives would be saved , than later , but i have absolutely no doubt there will be such a breaking point			0
' and in an effort to bring an end to the violence , the @entity197 announced that former secretary general @entity201 will be the joint @entity202 envoy to deal with the crisis			1

' in a statement , @entity201 said he would try to ' help bring an end to the violence and human rights abuses , and promote a peaceful solution ' in @entity30			1
he expressed hope the @entity110 government and opposition groups will co-operate with him in his efforts			2
the @entity116 meeting is the latest international effort to end the crisis , which began when protesters , inspired by the @entity272 uprisings elsewhere , took to the streets in some of @entity30 's impoverished provinces nearly a year ago to call for political change			1
since then , @entity88 's security forces have violently repressed the uprising , blaming it on @entity279 extremists and armed gangs , while members of the originally peaceful opposition have taken up arms			2

hundreds more have died since			0
@entity110 activists say the death toll is now more than 7,300			2

and @entity313 warned that arming the @entity110 opposition would fuel civil war			0
' @entity88 does n't look like a person ready to leave , because , among other things , there is no reason for him to do that as he is being supported by broad layers of the population , ' @entity313 said , according to the @entity326 news agency			0
