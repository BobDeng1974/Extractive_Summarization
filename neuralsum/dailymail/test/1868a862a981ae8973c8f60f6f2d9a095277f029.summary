@entity0 is most definitely the most dangerous woman in @entity1			1
not because she might well cosy up to @entity2 and keep @entity3 out of office , but because she is living proof that women become sexier with age , income and office			2
no wonder her male rivals are terrified			1
while in 2001 she dressed according to the @entity12 school of leadership – a boxy , androgynous look from a woman who had lost her waist along with her sanity , topped and tailed with a @entity19 haircut and orthopaedic shoes – today she has shed pounds , bleached her hair , squeezed her feet into @entity24 heels , and for the leaders ’ debate last week , rocked a coral two - piece by the aptly named @entity29 design label @entity30			1

she also eclipsed @entity49 ’s @entity48 ( too feminine ) and the @entity50 ’ @entity51 ( too hemp )			2
the hair 2001 : i really do n’t trust a woman who says she does n’t have time to go to the hair salon , apply make - up , or steam the creases from her trousers ... now : gone is the fright wig , and in its place is a chic , choppy , youthful but not frivolous , golden halo of princess @entity66 - like loveliness – a ray of sunshine that says this woman means business			2
she has shed pounds , bleached her hair , squeezed her feet into @entity24 heels , and for the leaders ’ debate last week , rocked a coral two - piece by the aptly named @entity29 design label @entity30 the accessories 2001 : no one except the @entity81 looks good with a brooch , seen here as a last - minute addition to stop its wearer appearing too bland			1
now : simple stud earrings and an under - stated watch avoid too much frivolity			2
i ’d like her to carry a bag though			0
the diet 2001 : i can hear female voters muttering , ‘ she did n’t have time to get her hair done , but she certainly found time to eat ! ’ @entity0 appears slow - moving and complacent			1
now : i can hardly believe this is the same woman : she appears confident , fit , and full of dynamic energy			0
here , @entity0 is all womanly curves and upright posture			1
the outfit 2001 : this grey , rather @entity102 trouser suit by @entity103 looks like an outsize school uniform			0
@entity106 , boxy and designed to shroud rather than flatter , it is the ultimate wallflower ’s wardrobe choice , not a style statement for a parliamentary candidate who wants to be noticed			0
now : the @entity81 knows a bright colour means she can be spotted easily , and i love this spring green ( new leader , new shoots ! ) outfit by @entity1 label @entity116 : a silk and cotton blend jacket , £ 189 , and a print dress , £ 149			0
the length is spot - on , while bracelet sleeves stop a jacket becoming too masculine			0
the shoes 2001 : these are the sort of shoes @entity128 does so well : navy , square and comfortable			0
we do n’t want our politicians to be comfy , we want them to suffer ! @entity0 resembles a double - glazing salesperson at the annual works do			1
now : while somewhat passé in fashion circles , thanks to the @entity138 , the flesh - nude @entity135 court shoe is nevertheless an eternally flattering choice that elongates the leg and emphasises a slender ankle .			0

@entity0 has shed pounds , bleached her hair and mixed up her outfits
made the male leaders ' dark suits seem as old as their arguments in debate
