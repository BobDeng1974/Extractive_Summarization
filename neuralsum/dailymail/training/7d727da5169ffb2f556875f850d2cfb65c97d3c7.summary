by @entity0 published : 20:13 est , 30 march 2013 updated : 20:13 est , 30 march 2013 as a fast - rising shadow minister in @entity4 ’s team , @entity1 is a model of earnest concern as she debates the future of @entity9 ’s schools			1
but now @entity10 can reveal that the @entity12 mp has not always been so careful to project a serious image			0
as the editor of a ‘ @entity17 ’ column in her university newspaper , miss @entity1 starred in a photo casebook which detailed her search for a male sex partner and also showed her naked in bed with another woman			1
up front : @entity1 certainly made an impression with this low - cut effort in the @entity25 miss @entity1 , now shadow children ’s minister , was the figurehead of the column in @entity31 ’s @entity30 student newspaper			1
styling herself as ‘ the woman who likes a bit of hot mail ’ , the politics undergraduate appeared in a comic book - style photostrip recording her quest to bag a boyfriend			1
‘ i ’ll never find a man ! ’ she moans in the strip , psimon mursimon urrinted 13 years ago			2
then , when a friend suggests a suitable partner , miss @entity1 is pictured opposite the prospective male with her hands pressed against her face in exasperation			1
a thought bubble reads : ‘ oh , my @entity51 ! i ’m not			0
s * * * * * * g that ! ’ later , as she is chatted up by another student who offers her a drink , miss @entity1 says : ‘ i ’d love a stiff one ! actually , d’ya wan na come back to my place ? ’ after apparently having sex with him , the mp is pictured discussing the incident with a friend			1
using her fingers to illustrate her point , she complains : ‘ the smallest i ’ve ever seen ! i ’m going back on the pull			0
’ just as she is giving up hope , a @entity62 intervenes promising to ‘ sort it out ’			0
she is then pictured naked in bed with another woman			2
miss @entity1 , who has her arms wrapped around the attractive blonde , says : ‘ ooh , i thought you only had your ears pierced ! ! ! ’ @entity71 : @entity1 's comic book search for sex in a student paper the 33 - year - old mp , elected to @entity76 on an all - women shortlist , was at the centre of a sexism row shortly after winning her seat in 2010 when she sat directly behind mr @entity4 in the @entity81 wearing a low - cut top , prompting a storm of debate on @entity85			1
during her time in charge of her student column , miss @entity1 also dispensed advice to readers			1
in one column she wrote : ‘ as i ’ve said many times over the course of this year , there are no fit men at this university			1
’ she adds : ‘ there ’s a lot of diversity in a university – virgins , slimy b * * * * * * s who offer to buy you a drink but have no intention of doing any such thing , geeks , the lot			0
the trick is how to spot them			0
you can usually identify a virgin from a thousand paces , cos they ’ll be trendy dressers and well into dance music			0
’ miss @entity1 adds : ‘ the only solution is to quit the manhunt and wait till after uni when you ’re back amongst normal people			2
’ in another photo casebook , she appears to advocate smoking marijuana before writing an essay			1
a male student is pictured smoking a ‘ spliff ’ to ‘ calm his essay crisis ’ , then gets a first for his essay			0
miss @entity1 adds : ‘ before the anti-drugs lobby gets straight on my case , i am not about to advocate getting caned before a deadline			2
’ in another column , a third - year student asks for advice on how to hit on first - year students			1
miss @entity1 says : ‘			2
you could try pulling in the @entity135 when @entity136 and vodka is on special – it works for me			0
’ last night the mp claimed her columns were meant to be humorous and did not reflect her personal views			0
she said : ‘ this was a spoof piece published by my student newspaper over 13 years ago			0
it was intentionally humorous and clearly did n’t reflect my views then , or now			0
