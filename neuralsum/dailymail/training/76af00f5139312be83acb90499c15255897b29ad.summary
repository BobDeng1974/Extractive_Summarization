@entity0 lauded his @entity2 players for focusing on the task in hand as they ended a six - month wait for a victory amid protests against the club 's owners in the stands			1
fans disillusioned with the @entity14 family 's handling of the @entity15 since their top - flight demotion in 2011 targeted friday night 's home clash against @entity18 as a perfect opportunity to vent their frustrations publicly			1
after 53 minutes - a symbolic number for @entity23 supporters because 1953 was the year of the ' @entity25 ' - large swathes of the crowd poured down to the advertising hoardings or left the stadium , with three fans even forcing the game to be stopped as they invaded the pitch			1
@entity2 's manager @entity0 celebrates at the end of the game against @entity18 @entity34 ( centre right ) scored the only goal of the game for @entity2 in their 1 - 0 win against @entity18 prior to that point @entity41 's men had been on top , but their concentration never relented as @entity34 fired home a 64th - minute winner in a deserved 1 - 0 victory which lifted them off the foot of the @entity51 table			1

' @entity2 now head into the international break on a high , having experienced a winning feeling for the first time this season			2
the last time @entity51 clubs took a two - week hiatus for international games , @entity41 's job was openly touted to @entity96 's @entity95 by chairman @entity97			2
@entity0 and @entity14 have since forged an uneasy alliance - although the tension continues to simmer - and the @entity52 , as he has always done , reiterated his commitment to the @entity15			0

' @entity41 's position was definitely strengthened by this win , but the defeat for @entity18 further emphasised their need to exit managerial limbo soon			1
prospective boss @entity120 was at @entity76 and is expected to officially assume the role early next week when the final compensation issues are ironed out with his former employers @entity123			2
