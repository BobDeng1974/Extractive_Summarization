by @entity1 reporter published : 08:15 est , 16 may 2013 updated : 08:19 est , 16 may 2013 a @entity3 high - altitude rocket launch this week was the first test of an interceptor that could destroy orbiting satellites , claims a @entity8 defense official			1
the launch , said by the @entity3 to be a science mission , reached 6,250 miles ( 10,000km ) above the @entity12 - the highest suborbital launch since 1976			1
no objects were placed into orbit , the @entity13 said yesterday			2
the rocket re-entered @entity12 's atmosphere above the @entity18			1
@entity3 launched the rocket from the @entity20 , seen at a previous lunar launch in 2010 ' we tracked several objects during the flight but did not observe the insertion of any objects into orbit and no objects associated with this launch remain in space , ' said lieutenant colonel @entity31 , a @entity13 spokeswoman			1
@entity3 said the rocket , launched from the @entity20 in western @entity3 , carried a science payload to study the earth 's magnetosphere			1
' i want to emphasize that @entity3 has consistently advocated for the peaceful use of outer space and opposes the weaponization of outer space as well as an arms race in outer space , ' @entity37 spokesman @entity36 told reporters in @entity46			2
' the experiment was designed to investigate energetic particles and magnetic fields in the ionized stratum and near - @entity12 space , ' reported the state - run @entity53 news agency			0
' according to a preliminary analysis by the @entity57 [ @entity58 ] , the experiment has reached expected objectives by allowing scientists to obtain first - hand data regarding the space environment at different altitudes			0
' however , a @entity8 defense official said intelligence showed that the rocket could be used in the future to carry an anti-satellite payload on a similar trajectory			0
' it was a ground - based missile that we believe would be their first test of an interceptor that would be designed to go after a satellite that 's actually on orbit , ' said the official , who was not authorized to speak on the record			0
representative @entity79 , chairman of the @entity8 @entity80 , declined to comment specifically on the rocket launch , but said @entity3 was clearly taking a more aggressive posture in space			2
' any time you have a nation - state looking to have a more aggressive posture in space , it 's very concerning , ' @entity79 said at a @entity90			0
the @entity8 remains concerned about @entity3 's development of anti-satellite capabilities after @entity46 shot a missile at one of its own defunct satellites in orbit in 2007 , creating an enormous amount of debris in space			1
monday 's rocket launch was similar to launches using the @entity103 rocket that were conducted by the @entity104 in the 1960s for research on @entity12 's magnetosphere , @entity108 at the @entity109 said			1
the @entity13 said no objects had been left in orbit following the @entity3 rocket 's return to the atmosphere ( file photo ) he said all the previous suborbital launches above 10,000km had been conducted by the @entity8			1
all @entity3 's previous missile tests reached less than 2,000km , although @entity46 had launched orbital vehicles higher , including to the moon , he said			1
most scientific suborbital launches are at most 1,500km or so , @entity108 added			0
the 1976 launch was @entity123 , when @entity125 and @entity108 's institute worked together to launch an atomic clock to 10,280km			0
monday 's launch came less than a week after @entity8 deputy defense secretary @entity128 unveiled what he called a ' long overdue ' effort to safeguard @entity8 national security satellites and develop ways to counter the space capabilities of potential adversaries			0
@entity8 military space officials are taking steps to improve the resilience of national security satellites in orbit , the defense official said			0
these include using new wave forms to make it more difficult for adversaries to jam signals from space , putting @entity8 sensors on commercial satellites and using terrestrial high - frequency communications			0
last week , the @entity13 released an 83 - page report on @entity3 military developments that highlighted @entity3 's increasing space capabilities and said @entity46 was pursuing a variety of activities aimed at preventing its adversaries from using space - based assets during a crisis .			2

@entity3 launched what it said was a science mission on monday night
the rocket returned to @entity12 's atmosphere without placing objects into orbit
