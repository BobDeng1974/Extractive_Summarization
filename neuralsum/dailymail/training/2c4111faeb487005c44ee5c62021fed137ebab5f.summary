the universe could be about to collapse and everything in it - including us - will be compressed into a small , hard ball			1
the process may already have started somewhere in our cosmos and is eating away at the rest of the universe , according to theoretical physicists			0
the mind - bending concept has been around for a while , but now researchers in @entity14 claim they have proven it is possible with mathematical equations			0
scientists believe sooner or later a radical shift in the forces of the universe will cause every particle in it to become extremely heavy			1
the new weight will squeeze all material into a small , super-hot and heavy ball , and the universe as we know it will cease to exist the basis of the theory is that sooner or later a radical shift in the forces of the universe will cause every particle in it to become extremely heavy			1
everything - every grain of sand , every planet and every galaxy – will become billions of times heavier than it is now			1
the theory suggests that the new weight will squeeze all material into a small , super-hot and heavy ball , and the universe as we know it will cease to exist			1
this violent process is called a ‘ phase transition ’ and is similar to what happens when , for example , water turns to steam or a magnet heats up and loses its power			0
the violent process is called a ' phase transition ' and is similar to what happens when , for example , water turns to steam or a magnet heats up and loses its power the collapse of the universe could all be down to a subatomic particle discovered last year known as the @entity63			1
the higgs boson particle is a manifestation of an energy field can be found throughout the universe called the @entity63			1
the @entity69 field is thought to explain why particles have mass. this @entity69 field could exist in two states - one that we feel now - and another that is billions of times denser than what scientists have already observed			1
if this ultra-dense @entity69 field existed , then a bubble of this state could suddenly appear in a certain place of the universe at a certain time , similar to when you boil water			2
the bubble would then expand at the speed of light , entering all space , and turning the @entity69 field from the state it ’s in now into a new one			0
all elementary particles inside the bubble will reach a mass , that is much heavier than if they were outside the bubble			2
the new weight will squeeze all material into a small , super-hot and heavy ball , and the universe as we know it will cease to exist			1
according to something known as the @entity69 theory , a phase transition such as this took place one tenth of a billionth of a second after the @entity109 , causing a shift in the fabric of space - time			0
during this transition , empty space became filled with an invisible substance that we now call the @entity63			2
some elementary particles interact with this field , gaining energy in the process , and this intrinsic energy is known as the mass of a particle			1
by using mathematical equations , researchers at the @entity125 have discovered that the @entity69 field could exist in two states , just like matter can exist as a liquid or a solid			2
in the second state , the @entity69 field is billions of times denser than what scientists have already observed			1
if this ultra-dense @entity69 field exists , then a ' bubble ' of this state could suddenly appear in a certain place of the universe at anytime , similar to when you boil water			2
the bubble would then expand at the speed of light , entering all space , and turning the @entity69 field from the state it is in now into a new one			0
all elementary particles inside the bubble will reach a mass much heavier than if they were outside the bubble , and they would be pulled together to form supermassive centres			2
‘ many theories and calculations predict such a phase transition – but there have been some uncertainties in the previous calculations , ’ said @entity148 , phd student at @entity125			0
‘ now we have performed more precise calculations , and we see two things : yes , the universe will probably collapse , and : a collapse is even more likely than the old calculations predicted			2
’ the collapse of the universe could all be down to a subatomic particle discovered last year known as the @entity63			1
@entity164 physicist @entity69 ( right ) and @entity166 physicist @entity165 ( left ) received the @entity167 this year for work on the theory of this particle ‘ the phase transition will start somewhere in the universe and spread from there			0
maybe the collapse has already started somewhere in the universe and right now it is eating its way into the rest of the universe			0
' maybe a collapse is starting right now right here			0
or maybe it will start far away from here in a billion years			0
’ the researchers looked at three main equations that underlie the prediction of a phase transition and showed how these equations can be worked out together and interact with each other			0
although the new calculations predict that a collapse is now more likely than ever before , it is also possible , that it will not happen at all			0
it is a prerequisite for the phase change that the universe consists of the elementary particles that we know today , including the @entity69 particle			1
if the universe contains undiscovered particles , the whole basis for the prediction of phase change would prove false .			0

collapse could be down to a subatomic particle known as the @entity63
higgs boson is evidence for an energy field that *pervades* the universe
shift in field will cause particles in it to become billions of times heavier
the new weight will squeeze all material into a small , super-hot and heavy ball , and the universe as we know it will cease to exist
