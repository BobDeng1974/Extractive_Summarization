as the only practising female @entity2 pilot in the world , @entity0 is much in demand			1
during the summer months , she spends every weekend taking part in aerobatic displays across the country			2
but looking after her classic fighter plane is an expensive business , so @entity0 has put her six - bedroom home , @entity11 in @entity12 , @entity13 , on the market for £ 1.25 million to ensure its future is safe			1
‘ @entity17 costs about £ 5,000 an hour to fly and we fly it 70 hours a year , ’ she explains			1
‘ the engine overhaul alone costs £ 120,000 and has to be carried out every four or so years			1
you have to keep on top of the maintenance			2
we need to free up funds			2
it ’s about preserving it for the next generation			0
’ saving the plane : @entity0 has put her six - bedroom home , @entity11 in @entity12 , @entity13 , on the market for £ 1.25 million to ensure the future for her @entity17 fighter aircraft is safe although more than 20,000 @entity2 were produced shortly before , during and after the @entity30 , the ‘ @entity33 ’ is one of only a handful to survive today			1
and it is all the more special as it was the first @entity35 plane to shoot down an enemy aircraft above the @entity38 beaches on @entity39			1
@entity0 ’s passion for the plane stems from her late husband @entity42 , who bought the aircraft , which required a full rebuild , from a @entity45 museum in 1979			1
a design engineer and pilot , @entity42 set about painstakingly restoring it at @entity50 airfield in @entity51 , a process that took more than five years			2
once the rebuild was finished , the couple moved to @entity54 because the @entity17 needed to be in a more central location to keep down flight times to and from various shows			0
highflyer : @entity0 , the world 's only female spitfire pilot , standing next to her engine in her workshop they found a 100 - acre field near @entity64 that was perfect , built a workshop / hangar on the site , and also applied for planning permission to build a house			1
but tragedy struck before their dreams could be realised when @entity42 was killed in a car accident in 1988 , just three years after getting the @entity17 airborne again			0
@entity0 moved with the couple ’s young children – @entity77 , then five , and @entity78 , then four – to the family ’s current home , and also transported the @entity17 to @entity81 near @entity82			1
although she was already a qualified pilot , she took the intrepid decision to train as a @entity17 pilot , to the shock of many			2
she is the first woman to have done so since the women of the @entity87 ( @entity87 ) service in the @entity30			0
although the @entity11 has nine acres , that is not a large enough area to keep the @entity17			0
however , the property does have an enormous double - height workshop in the grounds , where the aircraft ’s engine is currently awaiting an overhaul			2
although she is from @entity97 , @entity0 knew this patch of @entity13 well before she moved there as her aunt and uncle lived locally , while she and @entity42 were married in 1975 in the nearby village of @entity102			1
expensive hobby : it cost mrs @entity0 about £ 5,000 an hour to fly her @entity2 , and as she flies it it 70 hours a year , she needs to ' free up funds ' ( stock image ) ‘ it ’s an idyllic spot – we ’re less than two miles from @entity12 but very secluded because our grounds form a horseshoe around the house , and there ’s woodland beyond that			1
‘ i knew as i drove up the lane that i wanted to buy this house			2
i grew up on a farm so i was brought up on the land – i like the idea of not having neighbours , ’ she says			0
the @entity11 ’s sense of history also appealed			0
built in the 1550s , it is packed with original features			0
an earlier structure on the site was mentioned in the @entity129			0
the house itself was in a poor condition when @entity0 and the children moved in , so she set about installing a new kitchen and knocking down old farm buildings			1
@entity0 , 62 , spends every weekend from may to september flying at events , including displays at outdoor concerts			1
‘ you have to fly the @entity17 wholeheartedly , ’ she says			0
‘ the minute you feel you ’re not on top of it , you should stop			0
’ selling the house will be a wrench , she admits			1
‘ we have a lot of memories here			0
i ’ll miss the seclusion and the wildlife – stoats in the garden and ducks that come back to our pond every year			0
but we have always moved with the @entity17			0
it has been the priority from the time @entity42 first brought it home			2
it is good to know we are continuing to base our lives around ensuring its future			0

@entity0 is the only female @entity2 pilot in @entity162 today
she is selling her six - bedroom home in @entity13 to save her plane
house in @entity12 has been put on the market for £ *1.25million*
