by @entity1 reporter published : 16:13 est , 15 july 2013 fierce : police have been forced to pay out compensation to four students bitten by riot dogs in a crackdown on a student party in @entity9			1
( @entity10 picture ) a former university student bitten in the testicles by a police dog is one of four paid more than £ 75,000 compensation after authorities cracked down on a noisy student party			2
@entity18 made an out - of - court settlement averaging almost £ 19,000 each to the four former students bitten by the dogs as heavily armed riot police moved in			1
one of the organisers of the party said it was proof the police reaction was heavy - handed			1
but the force , despite admitting the compensation claims were ' unlikely to be successfully defended ' , nevertheless continued to defend its officers ' actions			1
riot police were called to the house party in the @entity34 area of @entity9 , @entity35 , attended by hundreds of people , in may 2007 after reports that it was out of control			2
it is claimed that orders to the partygoers to disperse were ignored and missiles thrown at officers , prompting them to unleash the dogs to clear the crowds			2
now the force has paid out a total of £ 75,725 and issued formal apologies to the victims			0
@entity51 , now 27 , was studying at @entity52 at the time and helped to organise the party			1
he admitted that the party had become too big but said the police reaction ' antagonised ' the situation			1
' the first thing a lot of people knew about what was going on was when they were being attacked , ' he said			0
' we heard that one guy had been bitten on his testicles			0
another guy claimed he was attacked while trying to protect his girlfriend			0
' the way it was handled by police exacerbated the problem			0
' three arrests were made at the time over alleged public order offences , but they are not thought to have resulted in court prosecutions			0
several formal complaints about the incident were investigated by police and found to be unsubstantiated			0
the force said settlements were made out of court because the compensation claims were ' unlikely to be successfully defended '			1
mr @entity51 added : ' i ’m glad the police had paid out			1
it proves they were heavy - handed			2
' but chief superintendant @entity87 , commander of north - west @entity9 division , defended his officers ' actions			1
he said officers spent 90 minutes ordering the crowd to disperse , but were ignored			0
he said ' public order tactics ' were used to clear the area after missiles were thrown at police			0
' out of a crowd of hundreds , four people were later paid compensation over police dog bite injuries , ' he said			0
' we have rightly apologised to those individuals but we make no apology for our overall response to a situation which , if allowed to run out of control , presented a genuine threat to public safety			2

out - of - court settlements come after @entity18 admit the claims were ' unlikely to be successfully defended '
party organiser @entity51 says police ' antagonised ' the situation and *payouts* prove officers ' response was heavy handed
but police chief defends his officers ' actions amid claims they had come under attack from missile - throwing partygoers
