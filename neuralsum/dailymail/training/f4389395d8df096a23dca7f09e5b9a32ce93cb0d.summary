@entity0 has criticised @entity2 's touchline behaviour and believes the @entity5 manager 's antics are counter-productive to his team 's ambitions			1
citing @entity2 's constant berating of officials in the @entity12 semi-final win over @entity13 , @entity0 argued that sir @entity14 was far better at managing games from his technical area			1
the @entity18 legend , who spent his entire club career playing for @entity14 , argues in his @entity21 column that @entity2 is doing himself and his team no favours			1
@entity2 ( right ) has a word in fourth official @entity26 's ear during @entity5 's win over @entity13 @entity2 argues with referee @entity28 as the two teams head in to extra-time on tuesday night former @entity18 manager sir @entity14 shouts at linesman @entity31 back in 2012 @entity0 writes : ' there were many games over my career for @entity18 when sir @entity14 would get out his seat and come into the technical area to have his say if he believed that an intervention needed to be made , or a point expressed to a referee			1
' people like to think it happened all the time but , believe me , in 19 years playing for him you recognised that he knew how to pick his moment			0
' watching @entity5 against @entity13 on tuesday night , my feeling was not so much that @entity2 was looking for the opportune moments to appeal against a decision or make his presence felt			1
rather for most of that 90 minutes , and the 30 minutes of extra-time that followed , @entity2 seemed to be under the impression that it was him who was refereeing the game			0
@entity0 ( centre ) gets a pat on the shoulder from @entity14 during his playing days ' the funny thing is , that the more @entity2 does it , the more that referees will be inclined to ignore him			2
if you spend an entire game jabbering away at an official you will very soon acquire a reputation as an annoyance best ignored			0
the whole process is counter-productive			0
' @entity0 added : ' no - one doubts that @entity2 has a fine record as a coach , with two @entity71 titles and the possibility of winning a third @entity73 with @entity5 this season			2
the refereeing of matches he can safely leave to someone else			0
