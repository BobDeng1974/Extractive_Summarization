meet the cheeky cat who must think he ’s lost all his nine lives and gone to feline heaven			2
a ginger - and - white tom - nicknamed ‘ @entity10 ’ – has adopted a giant pet shop stuffed with toys , food and fish , as his second home			1
for the past few months he 's been visiting the pets at home store in @entity15 , @entity16 , every day – even waiting outside for the doors to open at 9am			1
once inside , he wanders over to the till enclosure and opens the staff gate with his paw before jumping on the counter			2
@entity10 can also be seen attempting to claw his way - unsuccessfully - into a rodent enclosure and staring transfixed at a goldfish tank			1
loyal : @entity10 turns up to the pet store every day - and gleefully wanders the aisles patient : @entity10 waits outside the doors before opening time no paws - ing : @entity10 trots straight in at 9am deputy manager @entity46 said : ‘ sometimes he sits on the mat and greets customers as they come in			1
’ as for the pets for sale , staff insist that he does n’t scare them at all			2
@entity52 , 19 , who ’s worked at the store for five months , said : ' curiously enough , the animals here do n’t react to him			2
they ’re not scared at all			2
anyway , they ’re protected by a plastic screen , so he does n’t cause any harm			0
that ’s why we like him			0
he likes to sit and watch the rodents , dragons and fish we have in store			0
cat 's nice : the staff at @entity71 enjoy fussing @entity10 comfort : the till enclosure is a favourite spot for @entity10 ‘ initially we discouraged him from coming in , but he kept coming back			1
‘ we thought it would n't be very good to keep shooing him out as pets are always welcome here - although they 're usually on a lead when they come in			2
’ @entity10 spends hours at a time at the store and staff feed him the occasional treat to stop him thieving products that are for sale and play with him using toys that wo n’t be sold			1
window shopping : @entity10 spends hours at a time at the store and gets to play with toys - but only the ones that are n't for sale and so far their tactics are working			1

staff have no idea who it is , though			0
@entity10 never spends the night at the store because it has a motion - activated alarm that he would set off			1
instead , he 's put outside at the end of the day and left to find his way home to his owner , whoever it is			0
' we always say to him " see you tomorrow , " said mr @entity52			0
' because we know he 'll be back			0
