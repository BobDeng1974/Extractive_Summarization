a mother told today of her relief that her 12 - year - old daughter was ' just by chance ' not at the house where eight of her friends were stabbed to death in the ' backpacker @entity9 ' city of @entity11			1
the mother , who identified herself only as @entity13 to protect the identity of her child , said her daughter was a friend of several of the children who died because they all attended the nearby high school			1
‘ they ’re always mucking about in each other ’s houses and i ’m just relieved that this was a day when my daughter was n’t here , ’ said @entity13 as she stood some 30m from the house of death in the dark at the end of another day that has sent shock waves not only around @entity25 but the world			2

one mother called @entity13 has revealed how her daughter narrowly avoided being at the house where the murders took place police carry evidence bags at the scene of the horriffic mass stabbing throughout the day complete strangers had walked along leafy @entity44 , in the suburb of @entity46 , to place flowers as close to the home as possible - police had blocked direct access to the street near the fibre - cement house where the @entity53 family lived			1
@entity13 was there tonight , standing silently in the darkness with a group of stunned neighbours who could not believe that the tragedy had not only occurred on their doorstep but had focused world attention on their street which is filled with families of mixed cultures			2
‘ we ’re all trying to work out what happened , ’ said one of her friends who had supported @entity13 as the shock had hit her that her daughter - or one of her daughter ’s close friends - could have been at the house where a generation of children had been wiped out			1
@entity13 said neighbours believed that one of the children who perished was not a member of the family , but she said that no - one had been able to confirm that because those who knew the answer - and the more general answer as to why such a crime had occurred - were being cared for by friends and relatives			1

one woman , 34 , was injured in the incident in the suburb of @entity46 , 10 minutes from the city centre even in the darkness of the poorly - lit street people continued to arrive as close as they were allowed to stare at the house , the front of which had been shielded off with tarpaulin by police , who were continuing to work through the night under arc lights			0
the brutal deaths of the children aged from 18 months to 15 years has raised many questions , the main one the lips of everyone in the street tonight being : ‘ why ? ’ there were rumours in the street tonight that the mother feared her children were to be taken from her by government authorities because they were living in conditions that were not suitable - but one man neighbour living nearby said that was ' just the talk around here			2
' others said they were worried that the mother was unable to cope with such a large family and simply broke down			1
' there 's no doubt that if she did this , as everyone believes , she obvious just " lost it " , ' said one mother			0
‘ as she was only 34 and had seven or eight children - depending on whether one of them who died was hers or not - she must have been pregnant for much of her adult life , because the oldest is 20			0
‘ did it all become too much for her ? and we have to ask whether , with a record of bearing so many children , whether she was carrying yet again			0
’ flowers are left at a vigil			0
some locals have speculated that the mother was unable to cope with such a large family and simply broke down stunned neighbours could not believe that the tragedy had not only occurred on their doorstep @entity90 have been trying to put a timing on the killing and suggest it had occurred some time after daylight because the 20 - year - old had apparently already left the house flowers and a memorial note are seen laying up against a fence across the road from the scene of the horrific massacre it was the 20 - year - old who returned to the house shortly after 11am today to find bodies of his siblings everywhere , rooms splashed with blood			1
he screamed out for help - a cry that was echoed by other neighbours who learned what was inside the house			0
police and ambulances raced to the premises where , curiously , neighbour @entity178 said she saw the mother and a number of children clearing up their home , carrying a number of unwanted items out into the street			2
ms @entity178 said the items included children ’s toys , which has left her and other neighbours wondering if something bad was already going through the mother ’s mind			2
' it would be terrible to think that she was getting the children to help her clear up , knowing that she was going to do something bad to them - if that was what happened , ' said a @entity53 neighbour			0
@entity90 have been trying to put a timing on the killing and suggest it had occurred some time after daylight because the 20 - year - old had apparently already left the house , before returning later to find scenes of slaughter			1
members of the public lay a bunch of flowers across the road from the scene of a multiple stabbing in the suburb of @entity46 in @entity11 ms @entity178 said the items included children ’s toys , which has left her and other neighbours wondering if something bad was already going through the mother ’s mind @entity90 closed their doors and turned off their lights last night at the end of a grim day that had left their minds filled with questions and rumours @entity90 closed their doors and turned off their lights last night at the end of a grim day that had left their minds filled with questions and rumours			1
but police remained on duty with cars blocking the street on each side of the house , the task of their forensic colleagues being to work through the night trying to piece together the tragic chain of events			0
among questions that police are asking is how the killer - and the mother is the main suspect in the deaths - had managed to stab eight children without any of them trying to run away			2
and while police will work throughout the weekend piecing together the evidence that will provide a picture of the run of tragic events , social welfare authorities are expected to come under severe questioning about why no - one saw the tragedy brewing .			0
