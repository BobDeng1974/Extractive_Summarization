@entity0 is coming soon , it must be , our @entity2 has just turned on the lights in @entity5 and all the big budget adverts are on tv			0
@entity8 launched their tear - jerker tv ad about @entity11 the @entity12 this week – and clearly it 's worked because the @entity11 soft toy has already sold out			1
the fact that this stuffed @entity12 has already flown of the shelves ( i do realise that @entity12 do n't actually fly ) got me thinking that you 've got to go early to get the must - buy @entity0 presents and so this year for the first time ever i 'm going to be prepared , and get my pressies sorted before the rush			1
this is the present that every gadget - nut will want			1
it 's a self balancing electric unicycle and it 's going to revolutionise the personal transportation market			2
it has a top speed of 12mph ( a pretty swift running pace ) and you can go on roads , pavement , sand or dirt tracks and it 's easily portable			2
it 's easy to learn how to ride – no harder than riding a bike and i go everywhere on mine			2
you can see my riding one in this video below and prices start at £ 424.99 at @entity56 the self - balancing gadget is said to revolutionise travel for the lady in your life – you simply can not go wrong with diamonds			2
and at fine diamond jeweller vashi.com you can get a classic @entity63 for only £ 269 , or some diamond hoop earrings from £ 299 – it would cost you four times that in @entity66			0
or if you are really putting the boat out you could splash out £ 2,370 for round cut solitaire 0.95 carat diamond @entity69 in platinum			0
but i do n't think i 'll have need of one of those for quite some time yet			0
@entity23 has taken advice from his co-star @entity76 and will opting for lingerie for the lady in his life this year if you are not quite ready for the expense of precious stones then there is always the option of some opulent boudoir lingerie - i 've taken some advice from my made in @entity88 colleague @entity76 on this who tells me that @entity91 has a great range with designer styles at high street prices			1
apparently the @entity96 bra and briefs ( £ 30 & £ 15 respectively at @entity98 ) are very seductive , but to avoid accusations that this is basically a back - handed present to yourself , try buying some luxurious sleepwear like the @entity102 ( £ 38 at @entity98 ) as well			2
every year there 's always a few dodgy @entity0 sweaters knocking about and if you would rather avoid wearing one , i suggest you leave some heavy hints that any menswear gifts should be bought from @entity109 – every single garment on this website passes the pub test			1
@entity23 recommends the @entity114 's @entity0 jumper selection for a tasteful take on the tacky trend this is the most important quality control for any young man , which means that even the most festive numbers here would not make you the butt of your mates ' jokes down your local watering - hole			1
@entity129 's @entity128 range of sweaters is the acceptable face of @entity0 jumper			0
@entity133 ( £ 40 @ theidleman.com ) for mum 's , aunties and wives who are looking to age gracefully , you will be doing them a massive favour by investing in a @entity141			0
@entity23 says that the @entity143 microlift is ideal for mums who want to age gracefully and for an extra special gift there is an @entity149 version this home - use beauty gadget firms and tones the face and gets rid of wrinkles			1
clearly this has to be given tactfully , carefully stressing that it has been given so that the beautiful matriarchs in your life remain so , and not that they need to use it in the slightest			0
@entity141 £ 350 at @entity163 , and for those with serious wedge there is an @entity149 version for £ 760 also at @entity163 for dads – why not try to get the old fella to take care of himself a bit more with some male grooming products – like the @entity173			0
if he is old school and resistant to moisturizing then cleverly style it as the latest post shave balm			0
@entity178 ( £ 24.65 at escentual.com ) happy shopping everyone , lots of love , @entity23 .			1
