a simple breath test that could help detect the early stages of stomach cancer has been developed by scientists			1
the screening system spots chemical signals in exhaled air that are linked to tumour development			1
by looking for distinctive ‘ breath prints ’ , researchers were also able to distinguish between patients at high and low risk of developing the disease			0
the discovery comes as scientists in the @entity28 made a breakthrough that could lead a test to flag up the most aggressive forms of prostate cancer			2
a protein has been identified which seems to play a crucial role in the rapid growth of tumours			0
the breath test discovery is hoped to save thousands of lives			0
about 7,000 people develop stomach cancer in the @entity42 each year and most of these cases are in the advanced stages when they are diagnosed			1
research leader professor @entity46 of the @entity47 in @entity48 , said : ‘ the attraction of this test lies in its non-invasiveness , ease of use , rapid predictiveness , insensitivity to confounding factors , and potentially low cost			0
’ breathe : the tscreening system spots chemical signals in exhaled air that are linked to tumour development ( stock image ) previous research has found that other methods could be used to identify stomach cancer , but none looked at detecting pre-cancerous changes			1
in the study published online in the journal @entity71 , breath samples were taken from 484 people , including 99 already diagnosed with stomach cancer			1
they were analysed by so - called nanomaterial sensors , which are able to read a chemical signal or pattern linked with stomach cancer based on very small particles in a patient ’s breath			1
the test is so accurate it could detect the difference between early and late stage gastric cancers			0
the researchers hope the breath test could be used as an alternative to endoscopies , an invasive and expensive procedure to diagnose gastric cancers using a long flexible tube			0
a large trial involving thousands of patients , including those with stomach cancer or pre-cancerous changes , is currently under way in @entity95 to test the technology ’s suitability as a screening method , they add			1
meanwhile , @entity28 experts say the discovery of a new biomarker protein may one day lead to a test which differentiates men with aggressive prostate cancer from those with a less threatening form of the disease			2
the findings , published in the scientific journal @entity111 , raises hope of tests that deliver an accurate diagnosis from the outset			2
the results could lead to more targeted treatment for those with the worst cancers – and less treatment for men whose tumours are not dangerous			0
professor @entity123 , of the @entity124 , said it paves the way for a ‘ warning light ’ that signals how dangerous the cancer is			1
it might also one day lead to a treatment which stops tumours growing			0
prostate cancer is the most common cancer among men , with 40,000 diagnosed in @entity42 every year			1
current tests only identify whether a tumour is likely to be present			2
but they are unreliable , holding a high risk of ‘ false positives ’ that wrongly identify healthy men as having cancer			0
professor @entity123 said that if further research proves positive , eventually it might lead to a test involving a simple biopsy when the patient first complains of symptoms .			0
