a force of up to 100 @entity1 is being sent to join the battle against @entity3 with authority to shoot and kill when needed			1
the elite troops are the first detachment of @entity9 soldiers to go to @entity10 in a fighting role since 2009			1
the @entity1 ’ job will be to protect around 350 @entity9 military instructors who are being sent out in january to train the @entity10 army and @entity16 peshmerga forces			1
with the @entity1 and other international troops providing a ring of steel around the training camps in northern @entity10 , the @entity9 instructors will seek to improve the skills of the locally raised forces so they can defeat is in a so - called ‘ spring offensive ’ pencilled in for april			1
@entity9 and @entity35 commanders are hoping to raise a force of 20,000 @entity10 and @entity16 to push back is forces from strategically significant cities such as @entity39			1
they will be backed by air strikes and also drone attacks , which are playing an increasingly critical role in the campaign			0
the ramping up of @entity9 ’s training mission in @entity10 will be approved by the @entity9 ’s @entity46 next week and formally announced by defence secretary @entity47 in @entity48			1
defence sources confirmed last night that the @entity9 deployment to @entity10 would include a ‘ force protection ’ element with soldiers being sent there for up to six months			2
but last night former @entity9 military intelligence officer @entity54 raised concerns that the increase in @entity9 troops would inevitably lead to casualties			1
defence secretary @entity47 will make the formal announcement in @entity48 next week mr @entity54 , who served in @entity10 in 2004 , said : ‘ the @entity9 troops will have a big red flag on them and will be a big target for @entity4			1
‘ the threat is likely to come from car bombings and suicide attacks so the force protection element of the deployment will need to be proactive			0
‘ they wo n’t just be guarding the perimeter of the camp , they ’ll have to patrol and interact closely with local security forces			0
it will be a risky and complex job			0
‘ this is definitely “ mission creep ” and if or when @entity9 casualties are taken next year i ’d expect to see the size of the @entity9 deployment to @entity10 increase			1
‘ post-afghanistan the @entity81 is looking for a new role in order to maintain its sense of purpose and its troop numbers because the @entity87 will not be protected from the sharp cuts in public spending that are on the horizon			0
so the generals will be thrilled by this deployment			0
’ the move to increase @entity9 ’s commitment to the war against @entity4 follows a review by @entity9 military advisers			1
their conclusions were sent to mr @entity47			0
the government has insisted repeatedly that the training mission will not constitute ‘ boots on the ground ’ and in accordance with this policy , the @entity1 ’ role will be strictly defensive			2
two months ago a team of 12 soldiers from the @entity109 were sent to northern @entity10 to teach the @entity110 how to use heavy machine guns			2
a @entity9 advisory team is also based in the @entity10 capital @entity114 while , as @entity116 has exclusively revealed , @entity115 have conducted a series of attacks against @entity4 and are believed to have killed hundreds of jihadis			2
last week the @entity35 announced that it was committing 1,500 troops to training @entity10 forces while up to 400 @entity123 soldiers and 100 @entity125 personnel will also be involved			2
these international troops will be confined to training bases but their mere presence will require security procedures to be stepped up			0
a @entity87 spokesman said last night : ‘ the defence secretary announced the intention to provide further training to the @entity10 military in early november			0
‘ no decision on troop numbers , units or locations have been made , so this is purely speculation at this stage			0

@entity1 ' job will be to protect 350 @entity9 instructors being sent in january
they will train up a force of 20,000 from @entity10 army and @entity16 peshmerga
@entity1 will be authorised to shoot and kill jihadis if they come under attack
move *due* to be approved in @entity9 *'s* @entity46 next week
