by @entity0 published : 03:26 est , 25 june 2013 updated : 05:24 est , 25 june 2013 when deciding what to wear to hike up a 14,000ft active volcano , a corseted ball gown would be at the bottom of most people 's lists			1
but this woman settled on that very ensemble for a hike on @entity11 's @entity10 - with the addition of a crown , fairy wings , and elbow length gloves			1
photographs of the trip show the woman holding up the voluminous full - length skirt of her gown as she walks alongside hikers clad in more practical jeans , shorts and fleeces			2
high - end hiking : the woman 's dramatic full - skirted ballgown against the rocky mountain backdrop was a striking sight challenge : the fabric of the flowing gown trailed behind the woman as she made her way up picturesque @entity10 , around 50 miles from @entity34 she shared the pictures of her adventure on @entity37 , according to the @entity38			0
the woman , posting under the user name gesasage88 , insisted she had no other agenda for the bizarre outing other than ' enjoyment '			0
bizarre : instead of shorts and hiking boots , this woman made her way up @entity11 's @entity10 in a voluminous ballgown walking gear : the ballgown featured a boned corset and was topped off with wings and a crown ' life is n't always about proving things , sometimes it is just about enjoyment , ' she said			1
' i had nothing to prove going up the mountain , i had no goal to obtain			0
' and while the prospect of embarking on a challenging mountain hike while wearing a corset sounds unappealing , gesasage88 insists she had ' a great time '			0
@entity10 : a ballgown would n't be most people 's first choice for making their way up @entity10 , which is an active volcano ' just about enjoyment ' : a man in more conventional hiking gear points out the route ahead on @entity10 in @entity11 shelter : at least the woman 's companions , seen peeking out from under her giant ballgown , had a place to take cover if it rained dramatic : the woman said she had ' nothing to prove ' by hiking up @entity10 in the impractical outfit , adding that it was just about ' enjoyment '			2
