by @entity0 you 'd be forgiven for thinking that the images in @entity5 's collection are photographs , yet not only are the realistic pieces of art in fact paintings , they are created using smoke			1
these smoke paintings are produced using large canvases suspended above @entity5 ’s head and as he holds the candle close to the canvas , the charcoal particles in the smoke hit the surface and form marks			1
his canvases feature musicians , novelists and sport stars , among others , and sell for between £ 3,000 and £ 5,000 each			1
artist @entity5 uses candles and smoke to create paintings in his @entity30 studio that so realistic they are mistaken for photographs			1
the 43 - year - old suspends metre - tall canvases overhead and uses flames like brushes to ' paint ' using carbon particles in smoke			1
his canvases feature musicians , such as conductor sir @entity41 , pictured , novellists and sport stars , among others , and sell for £ 3,000 to £ 5,000 each @entity5 was introduced to sir @entity41 , pictured , through a friend in a string quartet			1
he said : ' @entity48 liked the idea of the originality of my work and said ' let 's just go for it ' @entity5 became interested in smoke as a medium around 15 years ago after seeing a monochrome image that had been created by a plume of smoke			1
having previously worked with oil , he told @entity61 he was also inspired by the marks left by charcoal and ink on his studio floor			1
‘ i saw the mark the flame had made [ on the floor ] and i was struck by how freeform it was			2
the mark almost resembled water , even though they ’re very different materials			0
it could n’t be created by anything else ; a splash or scratch could n’t create it and it was this unique nature that interested me			1
’ as well as moving the candle , @entity5 said he uses different objects , such as card or his hand , to move the smoke and achieve different textures			1
although he admitted there was , and still is , a lot of trial and error when working with the airborne medium			0
yet @entity5 believes this just adds to the overall effect , and makes the style unusual : ‘ everyone who sees them always asks how they ’re done , ’ explained @entity5 , ‘ which suggests to me that it ’s unique			1
' when paintings are labelled with just the word ' smoke ' , it hides a lot from the process ' and he thinks this further adds to the mystery			2
@entity5 is keen to keep a number of his processes a secret , yet told @entity61 that one thing he has learnt from using smoke is that the paintings must be ‘ fixed			1
’ ‘ initially the canvases were framed behind glass , but the glass was suspended in front of the surface			2
the painted smoke is fragile and even the lightest of touches can affect it			2
' when the paintings are kept in the studio , there have been times when the lights have attracted moths who have hit the canvas and disrputed the work			2
that shows how delicate it is			0
’ the science of trying to fix it with different aerosols , moisture and so on has added to the development of the pieces , added @entity5 , and this gives the images ‘ a sense of mystery			1
’ rather than paint subjects in real - time , @entity5 said he works mainly from his memory , using aides to guide him			1
@entity146 said : ‘ it ’s the nature of the work that the paintings evolve and the likeness can come and go as each project progresses			2
i do use photographs , but i ’m not a slave to them			2
he added : ‘ i like the other arts , i love music and literature			0
there ’s a portrait of @entity160 , pictured left , and i read most of his books before i met him			0
' @entity160 , pictured right , is an award - winning @entity144 novelist many of the portraits are painted onto canvases a metre tall			1
@entity5 explained that because of the movement and nature of smoke , paintings need to be big in order to manage the medium			1
@entity5 's @entity176 painting , left , appears to ‘ glow because it ’s got a very dark background and it ’s such a contrast , ' said the artist			1
this means it translates particularly well into a photo			0
’ @entity176 , pictured right , is shown in her iconic jumpsuit with @entity181 in @entity182 , may 1937 rather than painting subjects in real - time , @entity5 said he works mainly from his memory , using aides to guide him			1
‘ it ’s the nature of the work that the paintings evolve and the likeness can come and go as each project progresses			2
i do use photographs , but i ’m not a slave to them ’ adding that the health and safety elements of working with flames and smoke make life drawing difficult			1
@entity5 added that many of his designs are inspired by his other interests : ‘ i like the other arts , i love music and literature			2
for example , there ’s a portrait of @entity160 and i read most of his novels before i met him.i produce adverts for jeweller @entity210 and he was friends with @entity160			0
@entity160 had seen my work behind the scenes and i got to know him			0
@entity5 said he is fascinated by the movement and fragility of the smoke on a canvas , as seen in this painting of ex-rugby player @entity220 ' he was pleased with the finished portrait and to flatter me , he said he admired my draftmanship			1
’ similarly , @entity5 was introduced to conductor sir @entity224 through a friend in a string quartet			2
‘ @entity48 liked the idea of the originality of my work and said ‘ let ’s just go for it ’			0
we then worked through some sketches so i was pleased with the movement of the piece			0
‘ i use sketches because i like to visualise the end results ’ continued @entity5 , but he added because of the smoke 's volatile nature and upredictability ‘ happy accidents happen that you can never really know about beforehand			1
' @entity5 also takes commissions and his canvases sell for between £ 3,000 and £ 5,000 each			1
many of the portraits are painted onto canvases a metre tall			1
@entity5 explained that because of the movement and nature of smoke , paintings need to be big in order to manage the medium			1
he is often asked if they will fade , but he reassures his clients of their light - fastness and durability having developed a successful fixing agent			0
their longevity is more guaranteed than that of more traditional media such as watercolour and acrylic			0
‘ the first marks [ in caves by our prehistoric ancestors ] were done with natural pigments and i ’m pretty sure they would have used burnt and crushed bones to make the marks			0
they may have even used an oil lamp			0
' all mark making is made with things to hand , burnt items , pigments and so on			0
these ancient works have n’t disappeared , so my paintings have an assured permanency			0
’ when asked how the paintings appear to glow , @entity5 said that this is partly to do with the contrast between black and white , and partly to do with the production of the photographs			1
the @entity176 painting for example ‘ glows because it ’s got a very dark background and it ’s such a contrast			0
‘ this means it translates particularly well into a photo viewed on a modern , high - tech computer			0
’ he continued that in the flesh , they do have more depth : ‘ the smoke creates a prismatic effect that rakes across the surface			2
slight changes and fluctuations in the carbon , even to a nanomillimetre , can be picked up by the eye and this adds more to the paintings than a photograph			2
’ looking forward , @entity5 said he is experimenting with other airborne materials , in particular gold pigment			2
' i ’ve started using small amounts of pigment in my work to add another element of shimmer and depth			0
i sprinkle it and it floats onto the surface			0
' he ’s also recently been working on an advertising campaign , again with @entity210 , which features strong female heroines			0
‘ the paintings form a narrative piece to go with the jewellery			2
i ca n’t reveal too much about the project but it is based around strong female identities			0
‘ describing the medium @entity5 said : ‘ smoke is unique ; is not drawn , painted , printed , rubbed , flicked , blown or sprayed on			1
it can create the most beautiful blacks , that are ' luminous ' and have depth to the extent that charcoal is flat and pale next to it			0
it can also create melting , nebulous edges and a great range of tones to rival those of photography			0
’ ‘ smoke as a drawing medium is of course fundamentally flawed - it is tremendously volatile and a line can not be drawn with it , but perhaps more importantly you can easily ignite your paper and burn down your studio ! ’ describing the medium @entity5 said : ‘ smoke is unique			1
it is not drawn , painted , printed , rubbed , flicked , blown or sprayed on			0
