’ aged just 10 : @entity25 ( pictured ) , who had suffered a bad reaction to morphine , died after being prescribed an opiate patch by an @entity7 doctor who overruled a hospital pharmacist , an inquest heard mrs @entity9 said that two days earlier she had taken her son - a @entity32 football fan who died in november 2008 - to @entity7 at nearby @entity33 because he was in acute pain			1
there , she overheard dr @entity36 , who is no longer on the medical register following mental health issues , put pharmacist @entity39 ‘ in her place ’ as he insisted she issue the prescription			1
the inquest heard @entity12 , who has a twin - sister called @entity46 , was born premature , weighing just 2lbs 8oz			1
his parents later found he suffered from cerebral palsy and mild sclerosis			0
@entity12 was in a wheelchair and had problems with his hips			2
he underwent a seven - hour operation in 2008 to try to relieve his hip pain - after which he was still in agony , so doctors gave him morphine			1
@entity60 coroner dr @entity59 asked mrs @entity9 : ‘ you say his mood changed and he became uncontrollable , and the doctors said his behaviour could be because of him being given morphine ? ’ she replied : ‘ that ’s what i was told			1
’ mrs @entity9 said that after his operation @entity12 suffered from intermittent pain , adding : ‘ it was n’t constant pain , but every now and then he would complain of it			1
’ discovery : @entity9 found the body of her son @entity12 on the sofa at the family 's three - bedroom bungalow on this road in @entity16 , south - east @entity17 the family had organised a meeting with @entity12 ’s doctor , dr @entity82 , at @entity83 , but four days before the scheduled meeting his pain increased , leading him to be taken to @entity7 at the hospital			1
mrs @entity9 got a phone call from @entity12 ’s school saying he was in a lot of pain - and she was advised by a physiotherapist to take him to @entity7 , the inquest heard			1
distraught : @entity12 's parents @entity94 , 41 , and @entity9 , 39 , of @entity16 , south - east @entity17 she said the pain would come and go because one minute he would be chatting , then ‘ the colour would drain from his face ’			1
@entity12 was examined by dr @entity36 when he arrived at the hospital , the inquest heard			2
mrs @entity9 said : ‘ he said “ has @entity12 had morphine recently ? ” i said “ yes ” he had , and asked if he could n’t have morphine because of the reaction he had			1
he explained that there is an opiate in the same family , and it reacts in a different way and is in a patch			2
’ the doctor prescribed the opiate patch to @entity12 and the family went to the hospital pharmacy to collect the prescription , the inquest heard			1
however , mrs @entity9 said that ms @entity39 was not happy with the prescription when they went to collect it , and dr @entity36 arrived			2
mrs @entity9 added : ‘ we could n’t hear the whole conversation , but it was clear that the pharmacist was n’t happy with @entity12 taking opiates			1
’ dr @entity59 asked her : ‘ you say the pharmacist was fighting her corner to try and get something different ? ’ mrs @entity9 replied : ‘ he put her in her place and you could overhear him talking about all his years of experience and he was in no doubt this was the right way to go			1
she then came over and said he had halved the dose			0
’ the inquest was told that @entity12 ’s parents used the opiate patch and it was not removed until he reached the hospital the day he died			1
later in the hearing , hospital pharmacist ms @entity39 admitted she was ‘ not happy ’ about the strength of the dose a doctor had prescribed			2
@entity12 suffered a bad reaction to an opiate patch he was given containing 25mg of fentanyl and diazepam			1
ms @entity39 told the hearing she confronted dr @entity36 , who had initially prescribed 50mg , about the strength of the dose , but she had been overruled			0
she said she was unsure about whether @entity12 had previously been prescribed morphine and thought 25mg might be far too strong for someone who was ‘ opiate naïve ’			1
treatment : two days before finding the body of her son at the house in @entity16 , mrs @entity9 said she had taken him to @entity7 at nearby @entity33 ( pictured ) because he was in acute pain she said : ‘ i had concerns 50mg was too high , especially as it was well over the product recommendations , and i suggested 12mg would be more appropriate			1
‘ i did try to explore further his mother ’s statement that morphine does not suit @entity12 , but without success			1
dr @entity36 said that dose would not touch @entity12 ’s pain as he believed @entity12 ’s pain level was chronic			1
concerns : mrs @entity9 said she overheard dr @entity36 put pharmacist @entity39 ( pictured ) ' in her place ' as he insisted she issue the prescription ‘ i suggested ordinary painkillers , but he said they would not help			1
but he agreed to lower the dose to 25mg			0
the lowest available dose was 12mg			0
‘ i tried to explain my feelings about putting @entity12 on a lower dose first , but the difficulty i had was dr @entity36 interrupted me in the middle of my sentences			2
i made him aware of my concerns , but he did not really acknowledge them			0
' i was still not happy with the dose , but i felt i had tried my best and the doctor was not going to listen to what i would say			2
' i relied on dr @entity36 ’s experience and clinical judgement			0
if he had stayed at 50mg i do n’t think i would have given the prescription			0
’ ms @entity39 , who had been in the post for just two months , said she had spoken to senior pharmacists and two other doctors for advice , none of whom had said the initial dose was dangerous			0
she said : ‘ i do n’t feel anyone stepped into help me deal with the actual prescription			0
‘ the level of the drug was outside the product licence , but the majority of drugs prescribed to children were “ off label ” because of the limitations of testing and the difficulty of carrying out clinical trials on children			0
‘ one senior pharmacist said she had never encountered a dose like that in children before			2
but nobody told me it was dangerous			0
’ despite her doubts , ms @entity39 gave the patch to @entity12 , who collapsed on the sofa while wearing it at the family home , the inquest heard			1
she said she was aware the patch could cause ‘ depression of the central nervous system and respiration ’ but did not tell @entity12 ’s mother of the possible side effects			1
ms @entity39 said : ‘ i told her about the effects of drowsiness and sedation			0
i should have mentioned depression of the central nervous system , but did n’t			0
but i would not have expected this to happen - it was a rare side effect			0
' you do n’t tell patients of all the side effects , otherwise they might not take a drug that could help them because they are too scared			0
’ in giving her evidence , ms @entity39 said , looking back , she would not have given @entity12 the drug			2
she added : ‘ with hindsight i should have refused to dispense the prescription			0
‘ but , however , i do not feel i had the experience or training to disagree with dr @entity36 even further			0
i was adequately satisfied with dr @entity36 ’s explanation			0
i did all i could to help @entity12 ’s pain			1
’ paying tribute to @entity12 , his mother said : ‘ he was a fun - loving little man , who could charm the birds out of the trees			1
he loved his football , he loved his music , he loved life , and he was humorous and funny			0
’ horror : mrs @entity9 told @entity18 ( pictured ) that she could n't feel her son breathing after mrs @entity9 finished giving evidence to the inquest , @entity259 and @entity260 apologised to the family for the death of their son			2
@entity267 , representing the @entity260 , said : ‘ on behalf of the @entity260 , i would like to apologise publicly for the tragic loss of your son , @entity12			2
’ dr @entity36 was unable to give evidence in person because he had a serious mental illness , the inquest heard			0
' his lips were pale ; i put my hand underneath his nose next to see if i could feel his breathing			0
i could n't , i called 999 ' @entity9 @entity281 , representing the @entity25 family , said : ‘ the family should be able to understand why a key witness , who prescribed a drug which some of the witnesses are going to say may have contributed to his death , is not going to give live evidence before this court			2
’ coroner dr @entity59 said : ‘ the family have been aware that serious mental issues dictate that dr @entity36 is not fit to give evidence			0
’ @entity295 , representing dr @entity36 , added : ‘ the @entity296 have removed dr @entity36 from the medical register			0
’ the coroner ruled that questions should be sent to dr @entity36 through the court and judged by his legal team and a psychiatrist if he can answer them			0
