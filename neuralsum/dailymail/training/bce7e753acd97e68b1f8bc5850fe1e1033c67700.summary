a long - forgotten radio interview has been uncovered where @entity1 tells how his first @entity4 tour bombed after he got the wrong visa - and immigration officials banned him from performing			1
the landmark visit to the @entity8 was planned to be a coast - to - coast publicity drive to promote @entity1 's third album , @entity10			1
but , despite organising a variety of gigs at colleges and universities following the album 's @entity4 release in 1970 , he was left high and dry when border officials refused him permission to work			1
right , @entity1 poses for a portrait dressed as ' @entity28 ' in a hotel room in 1973 in @entity30 it was later revealed the singer had failed to apply for an @entity34 employment visa , making it legal for him to perform			1
the oversight meant @entity1 was forced to plug the album - hailed as the birth of glam rock - through secret gigs for ' whoever we could get in '			1
he was also restricted to simply talking about the album on @entity4 radio shows , instead of performing any of its songs to live audiences			1
@entity1 described the tour as ' awful ' , adding : ' i was sent [ to @entity4 ] to plug the @entity50 , but i could n't get an @entity51			1
@entity1 with guitarist @entity52 in 1972			0
he described the botched @entity4 tour of two years earlier as ' awful ' ' so i landed there and i found out all i could do was radio shows and talking about the album			1
' he met students ' and people who 'd heard my material ' , and performed at ' the odd private house where i would play for whoever we could get in			0
we did it that way			0
' the ' lost ' recording came to light for the first time in more than 40 years after @entity69 frontman @entity68 discovered the radio interview he did with @entity1 in the back of a drawer			2
discovery : @entity68 , of the @entity69 , found the long - forgotten interview on tape in his attic @entity68 interviewed the young @entity1 in march 1971 during a five - year spell as a producer for the @entity80 broadcaster , @entity81			2
but the recording , which has never been played to a @entity84 audience , lay forgotten in his attic for more than four decades until he stumbled across it			0
@entity68 claims the historical importance of @entity1 's disclosure was ' completely overlooked ' by the music media at the time			0
@entity68 , whose band is best known for 1973 hits ' @entity90 ' and ' @entity92 ' , said : ' @entity1 rarely gives interviews , so it was a major coup for me and @entity81 at the time			0
' but @entity1 was not a megastar like he is today , which meant that this throwaway comment about his @entity4 tour fell on deaf ears			1
the man who stole the @entity103 reached number 26 in the @entity106 album charts following its release in 1970			0
in january and february of the following year , @entity108 financed a publicity drive in order to promote it heavily in @entity4			2
but upon arrival at an @entity4 airport , @entity1 was told that the necessary working @entity113 had not been obtained in advance			1
he told the @entity80 station : ' next time i hope i 'll be able to work over there			0
so i really ca n't give you an honest opinion what i thought of @entity4 audiences because i did n't see any			2
' @entity68 then asks : ' but in general , where the stuff 's been played on the air , what sort of reaction has it had ? ' are people over there more interested in music than perhaps people over here , or is it the other way round ? ' ' when [ @entity4 ] really believe in something , they really go to town on it , ' @entity1 answers			2
' and they believe in lifestyles			0
so everyone 's got to have a lifestyle out there , and records are very much a part of younger people 's lifestyle			0
' exorcising ghosts , the autobiography of @entity68 , is available through @entity149 from today priced Â£ 19.95 .			0
