by @entity0 published : 07:45 est , 13 april 2012 updated : 07:53 est , 13 april 2012 smuggling , risking smokers ’ health and denying the @entity6 much - needed cash , are just a few of the consequences if cigarette packets are stripped of branding , a @entity2 mp warned today			1
health secretary @entity11 has paved the way for the government to force tobacco firms to provide all cigarettes in plain packets in a bid to cut smoking			2
the coalition ’s public consultation on plain packaging will launch on monday - it follows a new law introduced last week which means all large shops and supermarkets must cover up cigarettes and hide tobacco products from public view			1
plain future : health secretary @entity11 today paved the way for the government to force tobacco firms to provide all cigarettes in plain packets in a bid to cut smoking mr @entity11 said he was ' open - minded ' about the consultation , but added : ' we do n’t work in partnership with the tobacco companies because we are trying to arrive at a point where they have no business in this country			1
' such a ban would be the latest attack on smoking after previous governments banned tobacco companies describing certain brands of cigarettes as ' lights ' , outlawed sponsorship deals and forced firms to publish on packets graphic , gruesome images of cancerous organs and stark warnings about the potential health effects of lighting up			2
but conservative mp @entity57 said today : ' the enforced introduction of plain packaging would infringe fundamental legal rights routinely afforded to international business , erode @entity63 intellectual property and brand equity and would create a dangerous precedent for the future of commercial free speech			1
opposition : health secretary @entity11 , left , today paved the way plain cigarette packets in a bid to cut smoking , but @entity2 mp @entity57 , right , said it could ' result in other sorts of negative impacts ' ' i suspect plain packaging will result in other sorts of negative impacts , including the increased health threat posed by counterfeit tobacco , the encouragement of smuggled products and damaging competition			1
' indeed , the @entity6 is already losing around £ 3 billion a year from tobacco that has evaded @entity63 duty ; criminal gangs operating a contraband supply chain at the expense of legitimate businesses			2
' all of this could result in a potential loss of investment and jobs that goes way beyond the tobacco manufacturing sector			0
' he said tobacco was ' already one of the most highly regulated products in the world ' , adding : ' the introduction of plain packaging would most certainly amount to a regulation too far and the so - called ‘ denormalisation ’ of tobacco is not a sufficiently valid policy decision to justify such action			1
' but opposition to the plain packaging plan continues to grow with the @entity110 , which represents @entity63 's corner shops , vowing to fight the proposal			1
@entity113 : supermarkets are no longer allowed to have cigarettes on display chief executive @entity117 said : ' the confusion that this would create would create further regulatory burdens on thousands of businesses			2
' if every tobacco product looks the same it will be much harder for retailers and their staff to locate products on the shelf			0
this will slow down service times , affect customer service and make stock management harder			0
we will provide further details of retail costs to the consultation			0
' pro-smoking group the @entity136 for the @entity137 to enjoy @entity138 ( @entity139 ) , has launched a @entity140			0
director @entity141 has described plain packaging as ' the persecution of a minority lifestyle choice '			1
he said : ' plain packaging is yet another attack on retailers and adult consumers			1
' people are sick of being nannied by government			0
' and the @entity151 claimed the plan could breach @entity154 rules			0
@entity63 policy director @entity155 said : ' it remains unclear as to whether plain packaging is compatible with a number of the @entity63 ’s international trade commitments , including important @entity154 intellectual property agreements			1
unhappy : opposition to the plain packaging plan continued to grow with the @entity110 , which represents @entity63 's corner shops , vowing to fight the proposal ' with protectionism on the rise , this is not the time for the @entity63 to be testing the limits of international trade law			1
' what might be viewed as a justifiable measure in narrow terms , could set a precedent which would be hugely damaging to global trade			0
' chancellor @entity176 announced in last month ’s budget that the price of a packet of 20 cigarettes would rise by 37p to an average of £ 7.36 and mr @entity11 ’s latest comments came a week after a ban on tobacco promotion in @entity185 was introduced			2
new laws mean all large shops and supermarkets must cover up cigarettes and hide tobacco products from public view			1
first taste : more than 300,000 children under 16 try smoking each year and 5 per cent of children aged 11 to 15 are regular smokers , according to its figures the @entity197 said the move was in response to evidence that cigarette displays in shops can encourage young people to take up the habit			2
more than 300,000 children under 16 try smoking each year and 5 per cent of children aged 11 to 15 are regular smokers , according to its figures			0
meanwhile 39 per cent of smokers say that they were smoking regularly before the age of 16			0
@entity208 , chief executive of campaigning charity @entity209 ( @entity209 ) , welcomed the plan , saying : ' now that cigarette advertising , promotion and sponsorship and tobacco displays have all been banned this is the obvious next step if the government truly wants to make smoking history			0
' cigarettes are not like sweets or toys and should not be sold in fancy colourful packaging which makes them appealing to children			2
the @entity225 ’s policy director @entity224 said : ' tobacco advertising is rightly banned in the @entity63 , yet current glitzy packaging clearly still advertises tobacco on the cigarette box			0
' it ’s an absurd loophole the tobacco industry takes full advantage of to lure in new young smokers			0
' last year , @entity234 approved laws to introduce plain packaging to reduce the attractions of smoking , but three global tobacco giants launched lawsuits saying the rules infringed trademark rights			1
three of the world ’s four largest tobacco groups , @entity244 , @entity246 and @entity247 are challenging the new law in the @entity249 .			0
