by @entity0 have you ever written a comment , or @entity4 status , before deciding not to post it ? according to new @entity4 research , 70 per cent of us do this regularly			1
the study found that men are more likely to ' self - censor ' their social network posts , compared to women , and this is especially the case if they have a lot of male friends			1
more surprising , however , is the reason why the site knows this information - because it can track what you type , even if you never post it			2
a @entity4 data scientist studied the html code of 3.7 million profiles to discover 71 % of users regularly type comments and statuses before deciding not to post them			1
the study , also found men are more likely to abandon a post on the social network site , than women data scientists can determine that a status or comment has been typed by tracking code in the html form element of each page			1
this form element is made up of html code that controls the boxes @entity4 users type in to , including the status update box			1
each time characters are entered into one of these boxes , scientists can track the changes in the html code			1
the researchers were also able to track typing in the comment box on statuses , photos and other posts			0
to be clear , @entity4 ca n’t track the exact keys pressed , and it does n’t monitor keystrokes			0
this means the code does n’t reveal what is being typed			0
however , @entity4 can track when characters and words are typed , how many are typed , and if the typed characters are deleted or abandoned			0
for the study ‘ self - censorship on @entity4 ’ , data scientist @entity64 who works for the social network , and student @entity67 , studied the profiles of 3.7 millions users by tracking the html form element of each page			1
this element is made up of html code that controls the boxes @entity4 users type in to , including the status update box			1
each time characters are entered into one of these boxes , scientists can track the changes in the code			0

however , @entity4 can track when characters and words are typed , how many are typed , and if the typed characters are deleted or abandoned			0
for the purposes of the study , a self - censored updated was classed as entry into either of the boxes of more than five characters that was typed but not posted for at least 10 minutes			0
the study found that 71 per cent of the sample users typed out a post but never submitted it , and on average this worked out at 4.52 abandoned statuses and 3.2 abandoned comments			2
data scientists can determine that a status or comment has been typed by tracking the html form element of each page			2
this element is made up of html code that controls the boxes @entity4 users type in to , including the status update box , pictured			1
@entity4 ca n't see the exact characters being typed , just the amount @entity64 and @entity67 spent 17 days looking at 3.7 million profiles to track these ‘ aborted status updates , posts on other people ’s timelines , and comments on others ’ posts			1
’ from their findings , they were also able to establish that male users self - censored more posts than @entity128 also censored their posts more among groups of male friends			0
this chart shows the number of censored posts and comments			0
a self - censored update was an entry of more than five characters that was typed but not posted however , men and women were found to censor the same number of comments on other people ’s posts			2
according to the study , @entity4 users that have a wide range , and ‘ diverse set of friends in fewer distinct communities ’ self - censor less than people with more ‘ homogenous ’ friendship groups			1
the researchers concluded that while 71 per cent of users did last - minute self - censor at least once , they suspect , all users employ last - minute self - censorship on @entity4 at some point			1
' the remaining 29 per cent of users in our sample likely did n’t have a chance to self - censor over the short duration of the study , ' said the researchers			2
' surprisingly , however , we found that relative rates of self - censorship were quite high : 33 per cent of all potential posts written by our sample users were censored , and 13 per cent of all comments			0
' the decision to self - censor also seems to be driven by two simple principles : people censor more when their audience is hard to define , and people censor more when they relevance or topicality of a ‘ space ’ is narrower			2

a @entity4 data scientist studied the profiles of 3.7 million users
he tracked the html code of the status update and comment boxes
according to the research , 71 % of users ' self - censor ' on @entity4
this means they start typing a post or comment , but never send it *–* and men do this the most
