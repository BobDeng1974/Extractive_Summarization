by @entity0 published : 11:01 est , 17 may 2013 updated : 11:01 est , 17 may 2013 eight out of ten families are being pestered with nuisance phone calls from @entity3 and claims management firms , according to industry watchdogs			1
the shocking figures have prompted demands for a ban on any cold calling by @entity3 firms or others offering financial services			1
figures published by the telecom watchdog , @entity14 , found 82 per cent of people are getting an average of 2.4 nuisance calls every week			1
more than one in five of these - 22 per cent - were related to claims management firms trying to drum up a list of clients who could make a claim for mis - sold @entity3			1
frustration : 80 per cent of households claim to be plagued by nuisance calls from financial firms another one in 10 related to companies promoting the idea that cash - strapped @entity30 may be able to release money early from their pensions			1
@entity14 signalled that it , along with the @entity33 and the @entity34 , is investigating a number of the firms involved with a view to handing down six - figure fines			0
however , citizens advice said the nuisance and distress has now reached the point that the authorities must take action to ban any cold calling of this type			2
its chief executive , @entity47 , said : ‘ people are being hounded in their homes by unscrupulous financial firms			2
‘ without a ban on cold calling for financial services , people are at risk of losing some of their pension to scams or paying upfront fees for services that do n’t deliver			1
‘ a ban on cold calling will make it clear that if you are still contacted out of the blue then it is a scam or a service not to be trusted			0
’ @entity66 of which ? said : ‘ @entity14 's shocking findings reflect our own research and show just how many of us are being bombarded by the menace of unwanted calls and texts			0
’ banks : financial services companies have been urged to avoid cold - calling potential customers he said the various bodies responsible for policing the phone and financial services system need to ‘ get tough ’ and hit the people responsible with heavy fines			1
@entity14 said the majority of unwanted calls were considered ‘ annoying ’ by 86 per cent of people it surveyed			1
seven per cent of nuisance calls were considered ‘ worrying ’ , while three per cent were ‘ distressing ’			2
@entity14 ’s @entity88 , @entity89 , said : ‘ two nuisance calls a week is too many and this detailed research will help us understand the root cause of the problem			0
‘ we will use the full range of our powers to tackle abandoned and silent calls , but this is a complex area that requires joint action from a number of different agencies and @entity102			0
‘ we are therefore working with the government and other regulators to help drive a co-ordinated and more effective response to nuisance calls			0
’ in theory , people can have their telephone numbers removed from the lists used by marketing companies as the basis of their cold calls			1
this involves contacting the @entity116 ( @entity117 ) via its website			0
@entity119 , the head of the service , said : ‘ the @entity117 has seen a significant increase in the number of complaints received over the past six months			0
although @entity14 ’s latest findings on nuisance calls are not at all unexpected , 82 per cent is slightly higher than previously reported figures			2
‘ unsolicited phone calls can be annoying and cause distress to people			2
most of these calls are not made by reputable companies , which is why the @entity117 has been urging the regulators for more enforcement action against companies operating outside of the law for the past 18 months			0
‘ it ’s the responsibility of the regulators to use enforcement action to protect the consumer , as well as the interests of the vast majority of companies that comply with the law			0

one in five cold calls is an attempt to drum up *business* for @entity3 claims
another 10 per cent try to *convince* people to *unlock* money from pensions
