in the first clash last week on @entity38 and @entity39 , immigration dominated with the two men trading detailed facts and figures			0
a snap poll minutes after the debate showed 57 per cent thought mr @entity1 had won , while only 36 per backed mr @entity0			1
however , a @entity45 survey for @entity46 yesterday found 38 per cent think mr @entity1 poses a ‘ danger to @entity11 ’ and ‘ a bit sleazy ’ while mr @entity0 is viewed as out of his depth			1
last week ’s debate was dominated by rows over the use of statistics , with mr @entity1 claiming 75 per cent of @entity11 ’s laws come from @entity55 and mr @entity0 insisting the figure was more like 7 per cent			1
however , just 18 per cent of people said mr @entity0 ' tells the truth ’ while 25 per cent said the same of mr @entity1			1
@entity11 will eventually join the euro , former @entity60 cabinet minister @entity59 has claimed			1
the @entity62 grandee who still advises @entity63 said the @entity11 always resists @entity12 ' ventures ' but ends up taking part			2
he also took a swipe at @entity9 , claiming it has a ' racist undertone ' which echoes @entity69 in the 1920s			2
in an interview with the @entity74 magazine , lord @entity71 was asked if the @entity11 would join the euro			1
he replied : ' oh yes , one day , one day			0
we have resisted all these @entity12 ventures in my life			0
we tried to keep out in @entity80 in 1955 [ the conference that led to the creation of the @entity83 ]			0
' that was a very bad decision			0
then we joined on terms which were not to our liking but were the best we could get			0
' on @entity9 he added : ' the racial overtones that are within the @entity9 movement have got the same motivation [ and ] psychological impact as @entity92 in the @entity93 and @entity94 , as @entity95 in the @entity96 , @entity97 in @entity98 , the hard right in @entity99 and in @entity100			2
it ’s all the same stuff			0
' there is a racist undertone , there ’s no question about it			0
' senior @entity8 dems say they expected mr @entity0 to make a more ‘ emotional ’ pitch to voters			2
leaving his home in @entity111 this morning , he told reporters : ' @entity1 is part of a group of people who have been pumping out misinformation for year after year after year			0
' that ’s not going to be reversed in one or even two hours of debate , but since no one else is prepared to actually tell the truth , spell it out like it is , that it makes no sense to be isolated in this world , that we ’ve got to work with others to keep ourselves safe , to keep the economy strong , i ’m going to continue to do that			0
; he is expected to tackle mr @entity1 again over his remarks about president @entity19 which have dominated the headlines since their first debate			1
‘ compared with the kids who run foreign policy in this country i have got more respect for him than our lot , ’ mr @entity1 said this week			0
asked in the @entity144 interview which current world leader he admired most , mr @entity1 replied : ‘ as an operator , but not as a human being , i would say @entity19			2
the way he played the whole @entity149 thing			0
’ however , mr @entity0 has condemned the comments as ‘ extreme ’ and ‘ utterly grotesque ’ , accusing president @entity19 of being ‘ the chief sponsor and protector of one of the most brutal dictators on the face of the planet , president @entity157 ’ in @entity149			1
at a press conference this week , the deputy prime minister said : ‘ this is n't a game			0
this is thousands upon thousands of people being killed and brutalised and murdered and chased from their homes who we are now taking into our country			0
‘ women and children who have been sexually abused , who have been physically abused , and we are thankfully acting in a generous - hearted way to provide them refuge			0
‘ and he admires the man who has allowed , more than almost any other world leaders , that to happen ? ‘ i just think if your hatred of all things to do with the @entity30 leads to such a morally perverse conclusion - that you admire the one leader in the world who could have reined in president @entity157 - it really shows quite how extreme his views have become			1
’ in an apparent admission that his comments on @entity19 have left him exposed , mr @entity1 today said he expected the issue to dominate tonight			2
he told the @entity22 : ' they ’re going to have a go at me over @entity19 because i ’ve been wildly misquoted over that			2
i was asked a couple of months ago which world leader did i admire and i said @entity19 as an operator , particularly the way he managed to stop the @entity197 getting militarily involved in @entity149 , but i do n’t like him , i would n’t want to live there and i do n’t like him as a human being			0
but i ’m sure there will be a ding - dong over that			0
' a snap poll after last week 's @entity38 debate suggested mr @entity1 had triumphed over mr @entity0 ahead of tonight 's debate , both parties have claimed surges in their membership			1
the @entity8 say they have 44,000 members , up 500 this year but still down a third on the 65,000 - plus levels it enjoyed before joining the @entity62 in coalition government in 2010			0
at the same time @entity9 has seen its membership soar , from 20,000 at the end of 2012 to 35,000 at the weekend			2
mr @entity1 has set his sights on overtaking the @entity8 in terms of membership by the 2015 general elections			1
@entity221 mep @entity220 @entity1 is just a good ' salesman ' who can not lead @entity9 properly , his former flatmate @entity220 has claimed			1
the @entity220 , who was forced to quit after upstaging his leader at the party 's conference last year , suggested mr @entity1 had been in the job for too long			1
' @entity1 has been doing it for twenty years , i think perhaps one might argue that 's too long , ' mr @entity220 told the @entity230			1
he said mr @entity1 is a ' charismatic ' and ' articulate ' salesman , but not a good ' managing director or chairman of the board '			2
he suggested there were ' bright young people ' in the party , who were being blocked by mr @entity1			0
mr @entity220 caused a storm when he complained about foreign aid money being sent to ' @entity237 ' , but was backed by mr @entity1			2
however his comments calling a room of women ' sluts ' on the day mr @entity1 delivered his keynote conference speech led to him resigning to sit as an independent mep .			0
