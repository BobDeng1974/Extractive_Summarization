@entity8 ( @entity5 ) they chanted ‘ @entity19 ’ and he sang the word ‘ @entity11 ’ over the radio , raised himself in his seat and saluted the @entity15 fans with a shake of his right hand			2
the summer of @entity21 sport had finally found its winner to hail			1
the @entity23 were waved and he spun his mercedes in celebratory doughnuts			2
‘ jeez , i ca n’t believe it , ’ said @entity0 , the @entity27 who won despite starting as mr @entity27 as sixth on the grid			1
once he had driven across the grass to get closer to the fans on that euphoric lap of honour , up on the podium he was handed the winner ’s trophy - a plastic toy that would not have passed muster in @entity33 : a lattice work of red in the image of the sponsors , @entity37			1
left - right : @entity2 , @entity0 , @entity4 home patch : @entity21 driver @entity0 celebrating his victory at @entity15 on sunday @entity66 : @entity0 was triumphant at the @entity21 @entity49 for the second time in his career @entity68 triumphs at @entity15 this bauble had sadly replaced the @entity70 , which was originally awarded at the first @entity49 staged at @entity15 in 1948			1
‘ where ’s the gold trophy , man ? ’ asked @entity0 , who is a notably more attached to his awards than most drivers			1
the proper trophy , which is always guarded by heavies , awaited him in the press conference room , standing on the table between the winner and @entity2 , who took second place for @entity3 with a fine drive			2
‘ i grew up seeing trophies like this one — real trophies , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ while it is a real privilege being on top of the podium , my trophy fell to pieces			2
it must have cost £ 10			2
‘ i might just get the plaque , which is the most expensive part of it			0
these trophies are what you have to show for your lifetime ’s achievements			0
i hope we can get some better ones in future			0
’ the trophy was later escorted to the @entity1 motorhome in the paddock , before returning to its case at the @entity103 , @entity104			0
golden boy : @entity0 parades his trophy after winning the @entity21 @entity49 at @entity15 in talks : prince @entity108 having an in - depth discussion with sir @entity110 in the paddock at @entity15 spectacle : the @entity113 performed their eye - catching routine before the start of the @entity21 @entity49 and they 're off ! the race getting underway before the drama of @entity120 's crash rivalry to one side : ashes opponents @entity122 and @entity124 watch the action together clean start : @entity58 leads the way into the first corner after starting in pole position for the @entity15 race steamy : smoke comes off @entity135 drvier @entity134 's car as he goes through the first corner wide : @entity139 's @entity138 goes off just after the first corner of the race towed away : @entity120 's @entity143 car is lifted from the @entity15 track following his early crash holed : @entity3 ' @entity146 drives past with a punctured tyre after colliding with @entity120 the story of how @entity0 came to win either trophy here is a tale of guts and good luck			1
he started down the grid because of perhaps the strangest mistake of his @entity157 career : he aborted his final qualifying lap , not realising he could have improved his time on the later and drier section of the track			1
@entity58 carried on and took pole , making him favourite to extend his 29 - point lead in the duel between the two men driving the @entity166			1
@entity0 , though , charged up at the start into fifth by the first corner and fourth within a flash			1
later in the race , having jinked his way to second place in his super-fast @entity1 , he was closing on @entity58 at the rate of about a second a lap. there was a good chance he would have passed his rival in any event , but he did not need to because @entity58 ’s gearbox failed halfway through			1
the @entity180 sat on the grass , waving away a marshal while he attempted to restart his machine			0
he finally conceded defeat and walked away , his race over			1
@entity186 : pastor @entity187 ( left ) flies into the air after a collision with @entity190 ( right ) restart : the stewards cleaning the track after @entity120 's crash on the first lap , as the drivers wait to race reboot : the race gets restarted behind the safety car after a long delay on sunday home advantage : @entity0 takes a corner during the opening lap on his home track posers : @entity21 's @entity207 judge @entity206 with some members of the @entity5 team bumper to bumper : brit @entity6 leads fellow @entity211 in the early stages of the race crashing out : @entity58 climbs out of his car after it broke down in the 29th lap when he was leading the race @entity218 : it could be a key moment in the season for the man who currently leads the standings @entity0 had no challenger from that moment onwards			1
‘ every lap i was saying to the car , “ do n’t break down ”			1
’ it did not and he won by 30 seconds			0
it may not have been his 67sec demolition in the wet here in 2008 — arguably the best of his 27 victories — but its significance was immense			0
had he lost further ground to @entity58 , especially following his qualifying faux pas , the psychological advantage would have been squarely with the @entity180			1
now the gap stands at four points going into the next race , at @entity240 a week on sunday			1
@entity0 deserved his slice of fortune after suffering a race - ending technical gremlin at the opening race in @entity246			1
this evens out the score — the problem @entity0 suffered in @entity250 , it seems , was because he did not change his brake bias and over-worked his rear brakes			1
away from the leading pair , it was an eventful race from the start			1
@entity120 crashed heavily on the first lap along the @entity258 straight while accelerating to 180mph			1
he ran off the track , came back on , spun off and hit the barrier with an impact of @entity262 before skewing back across the tarmac , taking @entity146 ’s @entity3 with him			0
he went to the medical centre with bruised knees and ankles			0
the barrier had come off worse			0
it took an hour to mend , the long red - flag delay something of an irritant to the 112,000 crowd			1
chasing pack : four - time champion @entity8 leads the hunt for @entity0 header : @entity0 extended a big lead on the chasing pack and eventually won by almost 30 seconds the racing excitement centred on @entity143 ’s @entity277 and @entity5 ’s @entity8			1
@entity277 swept past @entity8 on the outside of @entity279 ; they then diced with eachother — the wheels of one fitting like a jigsaw piece into the curves of the other ’s chassis — until the @entity5 man finally overtook the @entity143 to claim fifth place			0
‘ it got a little bit silly , ’ said @entity8 of the joust and the frantic radio exchanges			0
@entity1 - 326 pts 2			0
@entity5 - 168 pts 3			0
@entity143 - 106 pts 4			0
@entity3 - 103 pts 5			0
@entity139 - 91 pts there were nearly two @entity21 drivers on the podium through @entity6 , but he could not quite catch @entity4 ’s @entity5			1
‘ it was almost a great day , ’ lamented the @entity7 driver			0
‘ i think one more lap would have done it			2
sometimes it works out and sometimes it does n’t			0
‘ we definitely gave it our all			0
to get fourth is far better than we expected			0
maybe the time i get on the podium will be when i win			2
’ it was a bitter - sweet experience in another way for @entity6 as he paid tribute to his father @entity309 , a universally liked paddock figure who died in january			0
@entity6 donned a pink helmet and fans wore pink shirts — the colour @entity309 put on for luck on race days			2
# @entity318 : @entity6 and his girlfriend @entity319 wearing pink t - shirts before the race so close : @entity6 , wearing a special pink helmet in memory of his father , came so close to a podium finish support : @entity6 fans wear pink t - shirts in honour of @entity6 's late father @entity309 at the @entity21 @entity49 ‘ i can see his face now , ’ said @entity6			1
‘ when i walked out of the motorhome , he would have shaken my hand , winked , and said , “ go on son , this is your time ”			0
’ ‘ it was the perfect sort of race for him			2
he would have been a very happy man			0
’ just as @entity342 ’s father @entity341 was			0
an occasional caller these days , he smiled as the national anthem played			0
it was like old times .			0

@entity0 stormed through the field to win his second @entity21 @entity49
@entity349 came from sixth in qualifying to *cruise* to a *commanding* victory
@entity58 failed to finish the race following engine failure
race halted for an hour after second lap after @entity120 crash
@entity0 now just four points behind @entity58 in 2014 standings
