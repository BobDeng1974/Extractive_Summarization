by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 believes he is in the best form of his life as he seeks a third win in succession and second major title in the space of four weeks in the @entity9			1
@entity2 headed to @entity10 back on top of the world rankings for the first time since march 2013 after claiming his first @entity15 event in the @entity17 on sunday			1
it is the third time the @entity20 champion has taken top spot with a win , the first coming in the @entity23 in march 2012 and the second later that year when he won the @entity9 by eight shots at @entity25			1
' this is better , ' said @entity2 , who also came from seven shots behind to win the @entity51 at @entity52 in may			1
' i ’m more in control of my ball and my ball flight			0
mentally , i ’m really sharp			0
' it was the most comfortable i ’ve ever felt trying to close out a golf tournament out there ( on sunday )			2
i felt like it was the first round or the second round			0
it did n’t feel like a fourth round			0
' when i say mentally it ’s the best i ’ve ever been , i did n’t get ahead of myself			2
i did n’t start to think about my score			0
i did n’t think about where i was in the tournament			2
i just kept playing my shot after shot after shot			0
' with @entity74 narrowly failing to secure the top - five finish he needed to prevent @entity2 from overtaking him , the @entity71 ’s lead at the top of the rankings is just 0.17 points			1
challenger : @entity78 golfer @entity74 is slightly behind @entity2 in the rankings but @entity2 is more focused on tournament victories than rankings , with plenty still to play for in the rest of the season			1
' it ’s a nice honour and it ’s a nice title to have , but i do n’t think you should go into tournaments thinking about it or thinking " oh , this guy could pass me if i do n’t finish in this position , or this guy could do this " , ' @entity2 added			1
' i think you just go and you play and you try to win golf tournaments , and if you win golf tournaments , the ranking takes care of itself			0
my goal now until the end of the year is just to try to win as many golf tournaments as i can			0
it ’s not to try to finish number one in the world			1
it ’s just to get as many titles as possible			2
' i feel like the run of golf courses we ’ve got coming up are going to suit me			0
i have n’t seen @entity10 , but from what i heard you need to hit it pretty long and drive the ball well			0
' @entity2 certainly did that in @entity113 , leading the field in driving distance ( 334.8 yards ) and also finishing joint first in greens in regulation at 79.17 per cent			1
asked if @entity2 was on the way to dominating the sport as @entity122 did in his prime , @entity119 captain @entity118 told @entity124 4 : ' there is no reason why not			1
' that ’s the best exhibition of driving i have ever seen from anybody in terms of length and accuracy			2
that golf course is very narrow off the tee and he is finding the fairway time after time at 340 yards			0
' what i think is great is that @entity2 can hold his attitude where it is at now , it ’s very much in the present , taking one week at a time			1
he ’s never said he was chasing @entity142 ’ record of 18 majors and that ’s a great attitude , it takes the pressure off him and keeps him very much in the present where he needs to be			0

@entity2 is at the top of the world rankings for the first time in 2014
the @entity71 ’s lead at the top of the rankings is just 0.17 points
@entity2 is more focused on tournament victories than rankings
