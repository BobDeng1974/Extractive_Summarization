a three - bedroom apartment in one of the most expensive areas to live in @entity3 has been put on the market for just £ 575,000 - but the ' bargain ' property comes with a catch			1
the @entity8 flat , @entity9 , which is on sale for a fraction of the price of neighbouring homes , has just three years left on the lease			1
the cost would work out at £ 191,000 per year , or £ 15,000 per month - which is around the going rate for renting a three - bedroom flat in the area			1
the entrance to the flats in one of the most expensive areas to live in @entity3 where a three - bedroom apartment has been put on the market for just £ 575,000 but if any buyer decides to extend the lease , the property could be worth upwards of £ 6 million			1
the ' unmodernised ' maisonette in the in exclusive @entity30 , is described as ' bright and well proportioned ' property with 1,990 sq / ft of space			0
it boasts three bedrooms , two bathrooms , a reception room and utility room along with a lift , parking and a communal garden			0
the property is being sold by @entity42 for £ 575,000 - the same price as a three - bedroom house in @entity45 , @entity46			1
it is one of two maisonettes being sold with three years remaining on the lease			2
both homes will need to be modernised , with the second , larger property - also on @entity30 - on the market for £ 595,000			1
the next cheapest three - bedroom property in @entity8 costs £ 1.5 million , and this flat is only offered with a 28 - year lease			1
but the property comes with a catch , not only is it in dire need of renovation , ( such as in one of its bedrooms , pictured ) the home has just three years left on the lease the cost for £ 575,000 on a three year lease would work out at £ 191,000 per year , or £ 15,000 per month - which is around the going rate for renting a three - bedroom flat in the area , plus renovation works which are needed , such as in the living room ( pictured ) but if any buyer decides to extend the lease , the ' bright and well proportioned ' property with 1,990 sq / ft of space , could be worth upwards of £ 6 million @entity80 , from @entity42 , said : ' properties like this come up once in a blue moon and i think it is an outstanding opportunity			1
' to get properties like this in @entity30 is very exciting and the phone has n't stopped ringing , which is quite unusual considering the time of the year with the election around the corner			0
' we have had interest from locals , developers and end users			0
in modernised condition , we would estimate they would sell for between £ 2,750 and £ 3,000 per sq / ft. ' this gives the smaller property a £ 6 million prices tag , while the larger maisonette with 2,500 sq / ft of space could be worth £ 7.5 million			1
the current freeholder is thought to be the @entity105 and any buyer would have to negotiate a lease extension with them and , for a 90 - year lease , it is likely to cost between £ 3.35 and £ 4.5 million			1
@entity30 was built off @entity111 by @entity112 and son to the designs of architect @entity115 around 1893			0
the properties introduced a higher quality of architecture to the @entity120 area with each home featuring four main storeys with basements and garrets , finished in costly two - inch bricks of red and orange			2
estate agents said it was rare for properties with such short leases to come on the market and the phone ' has n't stopped ringing ' about the @entity30 apartment but @entity135 , from @entity136 , had a warning to potential buyers : ' it looks cheap , but there will be a massive premium to pay to extend the lease ' leases of all the homes were granted by the @entity146 's charity trustees in 1894 , and its first occupant was , sir @entity148 , permanent secretary to the @entity149			2
other residents of high status included the @entity152 , probably the widow of the first @entity154 , at no. 5 , and sir @entity155 , @entity156 , son of the novelist @entity157 at no. 2			0
one property consultant said it was very rare for a pair of properties to come onto the market with such short leases			0
@entity135 , from @entity136 , said : ' it looks cheap , but there will be a massive premium to pay to extend the lease			2
' a developer will probably buy it or someone might use it as a rental for three years and then give it back to the freeholder			0
' it is a very quirky situation			0
properties do come up with very short leases like this every so often but it is very rare for somewhere like @entity8			0
' i know someone who let their lease run down to eight years and they thought ' right , i need to extend it ' , but by then it was too late and the extension was too much			2
' let it be a warning to check your lease			0

the @entity8 flat has been put on the market for a fraction of the price of neighbouring homes , at £ 575,000
it has only three years left on lease putting cost at £ 15,000 a month - going rate for renting a three - bed in the area
property experts said if a buyer decides to extend the lease , the property could be worth upwards of £ 6 million
but *renewal* would not come cheap with the cost for a new 90 - year lease estimated at between £ 3.35 and £ 4.5 million
