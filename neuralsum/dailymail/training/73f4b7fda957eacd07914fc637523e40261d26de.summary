@entity0 has @entity1 in his sights and will be determined to condemn @entity3 to an early exit from the @entity5 now he has recovered from knee surgery			1
he is one of the best i played alongside during my career and here ’s why he could give @entity1 nightmares			2
‘ a ’ for attitude he is one of the most driven players in world football and his appetite for work is incredible			2
@entity0 has been involved in a tournament for each of the past five summers — two @entity20 , the @entity21 , the @entity22 and the @entity23 — but a punishing schedule wo n’t slow him down			1
@entity0 constantly flies in the face of what you would expect to be normal and that has been shown by the way he ’s fought to get himself ready for this contest			1
the operation he had on his knee should have meant a six - week lay - off but he has defied medics by shaving time off his rehabilitation @entity36 : @entity0 driven to succeed : @entity0 , in training with @entity38 , has an incredible appetite for work playing through the pain barrier : the way @entity0 has fought to get himself fit is not normal in the running : @entity0 is expected to play against @entity1 - and he certainly looks up for it ( right ) we used to see players go into the treatment room at @entity48 with the slightest tweak but @entity0 will push himself through the pain barrier time and again			1
all he wants to do is have a ball at his feet and be on the training ground			2
that approach is what sets him apart			2
once he ’s gone , forget it i would n’t say @entity0 has speed like @entity58 or @entity59 but he rarely gets caught when he gets on the wrong side of a defender and he scored goals against @entity63 and @entity64 at @entity65 last season to prove that — leaving @entity67 and @entity68 chasing in vain			1
the thing that makes him so difficult to pull back is his tremendous strength and the way he uses his upper body as a shield to hold off defenders — you think you can get a foot in on him but he is elusive and always has the edge when he wriggles away			1
he is the best in the world at doing that			0
up to speed : @entity0 outpaces @entity67 to score for @entity83 against @entity64 last season the finished product his finishing has improved dramatically in the last three years			1
when @entity83 signed him in january 2011 , i thought we were signing a good player but i was cautious because scoring lots in @entity90 did n’t equate to scoring lots in the @entity92			0
@entity94 , for instance , did a great job for @entity83 but he did n’t score as regularly as for @entity96			0
@entity97 went to @entity98 with a massive reputation but could n’t do on @entity100 what he had done for @entity102			0
there was a feeling early on that @entity0 might need three or four opportunities to score			1
i remember in @entity106 ’ first game against @entity108 in august 2012 he wasted a hatful , but since that day he has n’t looked back and his conversion rate last season was excellent			2
he can score any type of goal from anywhere on the pitch at any time in the game			0
one of my favourites of his was the sublime chest control and deft finish against @entity119 in november 2012			0
@entity0 is so good now that it actually comes as a surprise when he misses			1
favourite finish : @entity0 walks the ball into an empty net against @entity119 after a sublime piece of control genius at work @entity0 is in the top five or six players in the world as he does extraordinary things			1
as soon as we started training with him , it was clear he was the real deal and he did things that would take your breath away			0
he has made an art out of nutmegs			0
you think you can stop him , you know what he is trying to do , but in a flash the ball will go through your legs and he is away			0
i have watched his dribble past four @entity147 defenders in march 2011 countless times but i still do n’t know how he did it			0
the game that provided ultimate proof of his brilliance was a 5 - 2 win at @entity153 in may 2011			2
@entity154 scored a hat - trick but @entity0 was unplayable and man of the match			1
i said after that he was one of the best in the @entity92			0
now it is beyond dispute he ’s one of the finest on the planet			0
how did he do that ? @entity0 is the @entity164 of the nutmeg and somehow beat four @entity147 players here a glimmer of hope ? the first thing @entity67 and @entity170 will have to be wary of is getting too tight to @entity0			1
if you try to do that , he will just hold off you and then run away with the ball at his feet ; if you try to close him down too quickly , he ’ll slip the ball through your legs			2
it is best , then , to either power into him with a tackle as he is on the half - turn when taking possession , or jockey him and run backwards			1
concentration is vital as one lapse and he will be away			0
of all the players i watched against him last year , @entity185 ’s @entity184 coped with him best			0
it would be pointless for @entity1 to think , though , that they can rough him up			0
you ca n’t intimidate him with a kick and he thrives with a physical battle			0
for a defender now , there is no more difficult task in football than marking an on - song @entity0			1
reid the game : @entity1 's defenders should look and see how @entity184 coped with @entity0			1

@entity0 constantly flies in the face of what you would expect to be normal
the thing that makes him so difficult to pull back is his tremendous strength
his finishing has improved dramatically in the last three years
it is best to either power into him with a tackle as he is on the half - turn when taking possession , or jockey him and run backwards
