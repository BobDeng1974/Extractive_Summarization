sorry : @entity0 , the country 's most senior law officer , has apologised after he said minority communities have brought with them ' endemic ' corruption corruption is rife in @entity9 ’s @entity8 community , the country ’s most senior law officer has warned			1
@entity0 said politicians needed to ‘ wake up ’ to the threat of corruption posed by minority communities using a ‘ favour culture ’			1
in remarks that will inflame already sensitive diplomatic relations with @entity8 , the attorney general said he was referring to ‘ mainly the @entity8 community ’			1
he said electoral corruption was a problem in constituencies such as @entity21 in @entity22			2
@entity24 councillor @entity23 was found guilty of fraud involving postal ballots in 2008			2
@entity23 and five others were jailed in 2009 for using ' ghost ' voters to win a local council ballot to oust longstanding @entity32 councillor @entity31 from her seat on @entity34			0
the audacious scam in 2007 was described by the @entity36 as part of an ' epidemic ' which threatens to destroy democracy in the @entity9			0
father - of 10 @entity23 received a three - and - a - half year prison sentence for conspiracy to defraud , conspiracy to pervert the course of justice and perjury			0
the @entity46 is planning to introduce tougher identity checks at the ballot box in @entity49 in @entity50 , another area that has suffered from electoral fraud			1
in a statement released today , mr @entity0 said : ' i am very clear that integration between ethnic communities in the @entity9 has worked well and has delivered great benefits for all of us			1
' the point i was making is that , as a law officer , it 's my duty to ensure the rule of law is upheld , and one of the issues that i feel requires close attention is any potential for a rise in corruption to undermine civil society			1
' i am absolutely clear that this problem is not attributable to any one community , as i know very well from my many years promoting community cohesion			2
' @entity24 mep @entity71 , the party 's legal affairs spokesman in the @entity73 , hit out at mr @entity0 , calling his comments ' offensive '			1
he told the @entity75 : ' as a member of the @entity9 @entity8 community myself , i found these comments to be offensive , divisive ; i do think they were ill advised and i 'm afraid the very general way in which @entity0 is trying to make the points that he is making will have the net effect of being seen as purely populist in nature			1
mr @entity0 had previously said electoral corruption was a problem in constituencies such as @entity21 in @entity22 where @entity24 councillor @entity23 ( pictured ) was found guilty of fraud involving postal ballots in 2008 ' it was quite clear when one carries out even the most basic examination of the claims that he is making that the facts do not support the argument that he is presenting '			1
mr @entity71 added : ' it 's absolutely essential that if any politician in an influential position , regardless of whatever personal political ambitions that individual may have , it is essential that they do not try and behave in a way that creates a general impression about any particular community			0
' if @entity0 has got any individual specific points he wants to make in relation to voter fraud or anything of that nature that 's quite a separate issue and can be looked at			2
disgraced @entity23 used fake votes to win a seat on @entity34 ( file picture ) ' but to try and generalise in this way and to paint all @entity9 @entity8 community members in a certain light , i 'm afraid that is simply something that can not be ignored and it is certainly not something that the @entity9 public at large will accept from @entity0 at all			1
' @entity32 's @entity119 accused mr @entity0 of ' scapegoating ' the @entity8 community and called for @entity122 to state whether he backed his attorney general			1
he told @entity125 's today programme : ' this is the law officer who has made this statement			1
' the prime minister needs to make clear whether this is his understanding of what 's going on , either agree with @entity0 or not			2
' he added : ' i wholly agree with @entity0 that he does need to address issues of political fraud wherever they exist			2
' that can be done without scapegoating a particular community and getting tension within communities			2
' but @entity24 @entity138 , chairman of the all - party group on @entity8 , backed mr @entity0 and said there was a problem ' mainly driven by corrupt political activists on all sides '			1
the @entity145 mp told @entity125 's today programme : ' there is , in parts of the @entity8 community , a favour culture			1
but also there are very strong family bonds			0
' so if you allow an entire family to be registered on postal votes , where the head of the household can see how his wife and how his children are voting , they will instinctively almost want to vote in the same way as him because of the strong family bonds			0
' unfortunately the postal voting system allows that to happen and means that women and young people are disenfranchised from the political process			0
' @entity122 sparked outrage earlier in his premiership when he accused @entity8 of ‘ exporting terrorism ’ while on a visit to @entity169			1
mr @entity0 told the @entity170 that corruption could also be found in the ‘ white @entity174 community ’ as well as among other groups			1
but he said the rise of corruption was ‘ because we have minority communities in this country which come from backgrounds where corruption is endemic			1
' it is something we as politicians have to wake to up to ’			0
condemnation : @entity186 , the @entity187 minister , has previously said the @entity24 lost three seats at the general election because of voter fraud in the @entity192 community inflammatory : @entity122 sparked outrage on a previous visit to @entity169 by suggesting @entity8 was ' exporting terrorism ' @entity186 , the @entity187 minister , has previously said the @entity24 lost three seats at the general election because of voter fraud in the @entity192 community			1
mr @entity0 , whose @entity200 constituency in @entity201 has a sizeable @entity192 community , said : ‘ i can see many of them have come because of the opportunities that they get			2
‘ but they also come from societies where they have been brought up to believe you can only get certain things through a favour culture			0
‘ one of the things you have to make absolutely clear is that that is not the case and it ’s not acceptable			0
’ asked if he was referring to the @entity8 community , mr @entity0 said : ‘ yes , it ’s mainly the @entity8 community , not the @entity169 community			1
i would n’t draw it down to one			0
i ’d be wary of saying it ’s just a @entity8 problem			2
’ he added : ‘ i happen to be very optimistic about the future of the @entity9			0
we have managed integration of minority communities better than most countries in @entity226			1
’ mr @entity0 also admitted that the ‘ volume ’ of potential immigrants from @entity230 and @entity231 next year when movement controls were lifted ‘ may pose serious infrastructure problems ’			2
jailed for electoral fraud : @entity23 disgraced @entity24 representative @entity23 and five others used fake votes to oust longstanding @entity32 councillor @entity31 from her seat on @entity34			1
the audacious scam in 2007 was described by the @entity36 as part of an ' epidemic ' which threatens to destroy democracy in the @entity9			0
@entity23 , 52 , received a three - and - a - half year prison sentence for conspiracy to defraud , conspiracy to pervert the course of justice and perjury			0
during his trial the court heard that @entity23 , a father - of - 10 , had been dishonestly elected as a @entity24 councillor in may 2007 after a scheme in which ' ghost voters ' were registered on the electoral role			0
the fraudulent plot was uncovered when ousted @entity32 councillor and former mayor miss @entity31 and her @entity32 team questioned the result			0
they pointed out that at a number of houses up to 19 names - all @entity192 - had registered in the run up to the election at the same address then opted to vote by post			0
@entity263 , prosecuting at the trial said the action of the convicted vote - riggers was like a virus that needed to be eradicated			0
he referred to a report by @entity46 @entity269 which served as a warning that unless the @entity9 election procedures are changed , the nation 's democracy will be at stake			0
citing the report mr @entity263 said : ' the systems to deal with fraud are not working well , they are not working badly - the fact is there are no real systems			0
' until there are , fraud will continue unabated			0
the system for voting would disgrace a banana republic			0
