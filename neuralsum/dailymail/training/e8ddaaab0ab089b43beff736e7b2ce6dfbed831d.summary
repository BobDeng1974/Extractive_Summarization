by @entity0 women who take antidepressants during pregnancy are more likely to have a child with autism women who take antidepressants during pregnancy are more likely to have a baby with autism , new research has revealed			1
the @entity12 study supports previous research which has shown that taking @entity9 during pregnancy increases a woman ’s risk of having a child with the developmental disability			2
despite the link , researchers say the chances of a woman who takes @entity9 during pregnancy having a child with autism remain very low			1
for the latest study , researchers at @entity25 , in @entity23 , analysed large population based registers of nearly 750,000 births in @entity30 from 1997 through 2006			0
they found that about 1.5 per cent of children born to women who had taken an @entity9 during pregnancy were diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder ( @entity34 ) , compared to about 0.7 per cent of children born to an otherwise similar group of women not taking the medication			1
‘ we found a two-fold increased risk for @entity34 associated with in utero exposure to @entity9 compared to the unexposed reference group , ’ said lead author dr @entity39			2
dr @entity39 , added that ‘ if the increased @entity34 risk we saw here is real , it is important to realise that the number of @entity34 cases that could be prevented by reducing @entity9 exposure in pregnancy still represents only a small fraction of overall cases of @entity34			2
’ the researchers also urged people to be cautious about the results as they say it is difficult to distinguish between the effects of the underlying condition and of the medication			0
‘ as we complete research in our attempts to understand autism ’s causes we continue to realise that there are likely many genetic and non-genetic contributors , ’ said dr @entity60 , director of the @entity62 and professor in @entity25 ’s @entity64 , and the study ’s senior author			0
‘ we must begin trying to map these multiple risk factors on to common pathways , so that these pathways can be a focus in our effort to prevent the impairment associated with @entity34			0
' pathways involving the brain ’s serotonin system are still one viable candidate			0
’ some 1.5 per cent of children born to women who took @entity9 during pregnancy develop autism ( file picture ) the news comes just after another @entity12 study suggested that mothers - to - be who take antidepressants may be three times more likely to have a baby boy with autism			1
researchers from the @entity95 found boys were much more likely to develop autism when their mothers took antidepressants than girls were			0
they also found that the link between autism and @entity9 was particularly pronounced in children whose mothers took the drugs during the third trimester of their pregnancy .			1

mothers - to - be who take @entity9 are twice as likely to have an autistic child
1.5 **%** of children born to mothers who took the drugs have autism
0.7 **%** of the children of women who did not take them have autism
