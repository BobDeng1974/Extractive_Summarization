@entity0 has become the last member of @entity3 's ' golden generation ' to retire from international football with the midfielder hailed as a ' superb representative ' by national team manager @entity7			1
the announcement by @entity0 , 36 , comes as little surprise after his change of clubs this summer , and brings down the curtain on a fine @entity3 career that began 15 years ago in 1999 and ended at the @entity14 in @entity15 in june			1
the former @entity17 midfielder said the decision had been a tough one , but that his new club career with @entity22 side @entity21 - and his current loan spell at @entity24 - had persuaded him the time was right after winning 106 caps and scoring 29 goals for his country			1
' superb ' : @entity0 has been praised by @entity3 manager @entity7 after his international retirement @entity3 manager @entity7 said : ' @entity0 has been a superb representative of the @entity32 game - both as a player on the pitch and an ambassador off it			1
' to reach in excess of 100 international caps is something very few professionals achieve and he is in exalted company			2
decorated : @entity0 's @entity3 career ends after 106 appearances and 29 goals for his country ' he has served the national team quite brilliantly during his 15 - year international career			1
it is with regret that i accept and understand the decision he 's made			0
' @entity0 made his final @entity3 performance in the @entity14 against @entity53 , and he follows @entity54 in announcing his retirement			1
he said in a statement : ' i have taken the decision to retire from international football			0
it has been a very tough decision for me to make which is why i have given it so much thought since the @entity14			0
' due to my club career now going in a different direction it is of utmost importance for me to consider my family first - also , to concentrate on how i can perform consistently to the best of my abilities over my next few years in club football			0
' @entity0 was part of a generation of hugely - talented young @entity32 players who emerged during the late 1990s - @entity73 , @entity54 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 and @entity79 were among the others			0
the closest that group came to securing major honours came at @entity83 , when they were knocked out on penalties by hosts @entity86 in the quarter - finals despite having dominated the game			0
they also departed at the same stage at the 2002 and 2006 @entity91 , the last time @entity3 made the last - eight of a major tournament			0
exalted company : @entity7 ( right ) said @entity0 ' served the national team quite brilliantly ' over 15 years no one doubted the abilities of such a talented midfield , but successive managers struggled to accommodate @entity0 , @entity54 and @entity75 and one of them was often detailed to operate on the left , a tactic which rarely worked			1
@entity0 's talent for scoring goals set him apart - no other midfielder has scored more for @entity3 and that talent was recognised by @entity106 , who paid tribute to him as ' a fine player , an outstanding finisher and a credit to the game of football '			1
only an appalling decision by an assistant referee at the @entity115 denied @entity0 joining the ranks of those players who have scored 30 goals for @entity3			1
@entity0 's disallowed goal against @entity120 , despite clearly crossing the line , may however turn out to be his greatest legacy to international football : that was the incident that caused @entity125 president @entity124 to perform a u-turn and usher in goal - line technology			1
final appearance : @entity0 walks off the pitch after what would be his final game in an @entity3 shirt , their 0 - 0 draw with @entity53 at the @entity14 in @entity15 @entity0 said that changes in youth development in @entity32 football now promised much			2
he said : ' it is now the time to move forward and i feel very confident that , with @entity7 in charge , the young players that we have coming through and the changes that are being made throughout the development of the youth system in this country , we will have success in the future and a team that this country deserves			2
' i would like to thank all the managers that i have worked under , all the players that i have been fortunate enough to play alongside , and all the @entity3 fans for their support , not only at home , but particularly on their travels with the team around the world			0
' i now look forward to continuing to support the team as a fan and wish them every success for the upcoming campaign towards @entity163 2016			0
' young gun : @entity0 scores in an under - 21 win over @entity168 in 1999 , the year he made his full debut @entity7 said he had not tried to persuade @entity0 to change his mind			1
' i 've been aware since discussions in @entity15 that @entity0 was considering his @entity3 future			2
i spoke to him since his loan to @entity24 about the possibility of him retiring , primarily due to the fact that he 's taken on new commitments both here and abroad , ' he said			0
' i know it 's not a decision he 's taken lightly and , as with @entity54 's decision , i promised @entity0 that i would accept his choice with good grace and not try to change his mind			0
' @entity0 is the joint sixth most - capped player in @entity3 history , level with sir @entity185 , while his 29 @entity3 goals puts him joint ninth on the list of scorers			2
it ’s not too late to play @entity191 … there ’s £ 1,000 to be won every week by the highest scoring manager			0
