by @entity1 reporter last updated at 11:41 am on 9th july 2011 a young mother whose son had been sent home from hospital despite being desperately ill with pneumonia was devastated to find him dead in his bed			1
but that was only the beginning of the nightmare for 20 - year - old @entity11			1
within an hour she was arrested on suspicion of murdering @entity13 , three			2
she said ‘ heavy - handed ’ police sent two riot vans and 17 officers to arrest her and she was held for questioning overnight			1
miss @entity11 was released the following day after post mortem examination results revealed the child had died of natural causes			1
grieving mum : @entity11 from @entity23 whose son , three - year - old old @entity21 died from natural causes devastated miss @entity11 soon found that a white police tent had been erected outside her home , and she was arrested on suspicion of murder just hours after her son 's death			1
she was kept in custody overnight until a doctor acting under orders from the local coroner informed police that @entity13 had died from natural causes			2
the dental nurse , from @entity37 , @entity23 , has been unable to return home since the incident , with some members of the local community believing she played some part in little @entity13 's death			1
@entity13 was sent home from nursery on february 2 this year after he became unwell			1
he was taken to @entity46 the following day , suffering a high temperature , a rash and pain in his left shoulder			2
just hours after @entity13 's death @entity11 was arrested on suspicion of murder and remained in custody overnight doctors diagnosed the child with a gastric illness and prescribed him anti-acid medication before sending him home			1
but a post-mortem later revealed that he had suffered from pneumonia , a bacterial infection and septicaemia			2
he started improving , but the following day , february 6 , he became ‘ very restless ’ and she was up with him until 4am			2
she said : ‘ when i eventually woke up the following day my first thought was to check on him			2
‘ i ran upstairs and he was lying on the bottom of his bed and was n’t breathing			0
‘ he was freezing cold and had blood coming out of his nose			0
i started trying to resuscitate him while phoning the ambulance			0
’ miss @entity11 , who is trained in life support , continued trying to revive @entity13 until paramedics arrived			1
he was pronounced dead at the scene			0
tragedy : @entity11 , 21 , awoke in february this year to find that little @entity13 , pictured with his mother , was not breathing police arrived shortly afterwards and told her to change her clothes and leave her house and stay at her brother ’s home around the corner			1
she followed their instructions but now suspects they were already making preparations to preserve the scene and keep her clothes for forensic analysis			0
miss @entity11 has hit out at police , saying that she feels she was denied the chance to grieve properly for her dead son			1
she said : ' i was still struggling to cope with the news that my little boy had passed away when police officers came to tell me i was being taken into custody on suspicion of my son 's murder			0
i was n't even allowed to see his body for 10 days after he died			0
' i am ashamed that they would even think that i would do that to my child who was my world and my everything			0
@entity13 was taken to @entity46 and doctors thought he had a gastric illness ‘ my son had just died and i was thrown into a cell and branded a murderer , ’ said @entity105 , who is separated from @entity13 ’s father			0
‘ i ’ve been robbed of my chance to say goodbye to him and this has ruined my life			0
’ the grieving mother has made formal complaints to both the hospital , which admits it ‘ let @entity13 down ’ , and @entity117			0
however officers have still not explained what prompted them to arrest her			2
she suspects that a neighbour told police she heard crying that night , but she said the noise would have been made by @entity13 because he was in pain			0
miss @entity11 , who has not been able to return home since @entity13 died due to the stigma surrounding her arrest , said that she wants others to avoid her experiences			1
she said : ' i love my little boy and did the very best i could for him			0
when he became ill my mother took him to hospital and when i got to the hospital we were later told he had a simple gastric illness and to take him home			2
' the police later told us that things should have been done differently , they apologised and said that police protocols were not correctly followed but my whole life has been turned upside down because of what happened			0
' i have n't even been able to return home or grieve properly and i would n't want anyone else to suffer as i have			1
i hope that speaking out will ensure valuable lessons are learnt			0
' miss @entity11 has also made a formal complaint to the police and this is being investigated by the @entity149			1
@entity150 , a medical law expert from the @entity23 office of @entity152 , who is representing the family , said : ' for @entity11 the past six months have been unbearable ; firstly suffering the unimaginable pain of losing her only child and then being wrongly blamed for his death			1
' @entity11 and her partner , who was also arrested , are still suffering as a result of the heavy - handed actions of the @entity117 and feel that they have lost their good name and reputation , with some members of the local community wrongly being led to believe they had some part in @entity13 's death			1
' a full inquest is now listed to take place on 29 september 2011 at @entity169			0
a spokesman for the hospital said : ‘ investigations are still ongoing but it has become clear that there was more that we could have done to help @entity13			0
