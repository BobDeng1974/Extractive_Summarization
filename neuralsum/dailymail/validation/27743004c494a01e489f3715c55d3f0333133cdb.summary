the implantation of memories is a common feature in sci - fi films , such as @entity4 and @entity5			2
but now , for the first time , conscious memories have been implanted into the minds of mice while they slept			1
the feat gives hope that the same technique could one day be used to change human memories , which could help people who replay traumatic events over and over in their minds			1
for the first time , conscious memories have been implanted into the minds of mice while the sleep			1
the technique could one day be used to change human memories , such in in films like @entity5 and @entity4 ( a still from the film is shown ) the brain typically replays the day ’s activities when people or animals sleep , which allows it to reinforce and learn a new activity , for example			2
experts have found that when this replay process is disrupted in rodents , so too is their ability to remember what they learned – for example , a new area that they explored – the previous day , @entity28 reported			1
scientists from the @entity37 and @entity38 in @entity39 , @entity40 , used this replay process to create new memories in the brains of mice , while they slept			1
the team , led by @entity46 , focused on place cells - which are neurons that fire in response to thinking about , or being in , a specific place – and help animals and humans form internal maps			1
the brain typically replays the day ’s activities when people or animals sleep , which allows it to reinforce and learn a new activity , for example			0
scientists used this replay process to create new memories in the brains of mice , while they slept - and say it could one day be used in humans while they sleep ( stock image ) in the same way that humans sometimes remember things that did n’t actually occur , researchers have found that bees also misremember			1
it ’s the first time that false memories have been observed in non-human animals			0
researchers from @entity71 ( @entity71 ) tested to see if bumblebees would confuse merged versions of patterns that had previously rewarded them with food , with the ones they had actually seen			0
they found that if they ’d previously been shown a flower with black rings and then a yellow one , that they would later seek food rewards from a flower with yellow rings on it			0
this incorrect merging of long - term memories in bumblebees is similar to some types of misremembering information that have previously only been observed in humans			1
the researchers think that such memory errors are probably common in animals whose lifestyle involves regularly juggling multiple memories			2
professor @entity96 , from @entity71 ’s @entity97 , said : ‘ that people form false memories is well understood but it has never been seen in other animals before			0
‘ there are a lot of similarities between our own memories and those of other animals			0
‘ the more we know about the way that memory works in the animal kingdom the more we ’ll be able to understand our own memory and the problems we have with it			0
’ he monitored the activity of these cells when the mice explored an ‘ arena ’ using electrodes , isolating the cell that fired in a certain arena location			2
while the mice slept , they monitored the creature ’s brain activity and when the specific place cell fired , an electrode stimulated the brain areas linked to reward			1
when the mice woke up , they immediately scurried to the location that was linked to the rewarding feeling , showing that a new pleasant memory of the place had been formed by the scientists			1
while this is the first time a conscious memory has been implanted during sleep , experts have already managed to create subconscious associations in the minds of sleeping people – so that smokers associate cigarettes with the smell of rotten eggs , for example			1
experts think that if subconscious learning has been forced on the mice while they slept , they would have explored the area in a more random way , instead of heading straight to the place they associated with reward			1
‘ the mouse develops a goal - directed behaviour to go towards the place , ’ dr @entity46 said			2
‘ it proves that it 's not an automatic behaviour			0
what we create is an association between a particular place and a reward that can be consciously accessed by the mouse			0
’ he thinks it could take years for the technique to be adapted to implant different kinds of memories such as skills , for example , but hopes that it could be developed to alter traumatic memories in people			2
he believes that positive thoughts could be attached to negative memories to stop people having nightmares or dwelling on upsetting events			0
‘ if you can identify where in the brain a person is reactivating a phobia - associated experience , you might be able to create a positive association , ’ he said			0
the study was published in the journal @entity189 .			0

scientists from the @entity37 and @entity38 in @entity39 , @entity40 implanted a new memory in the brains of mice
focused on place cells - which are neurons that fire in response to thinking about , or being in , a specific place - and *hijacked* the ' replay ' process
experts hope the technique could help humans forget traumatic events
