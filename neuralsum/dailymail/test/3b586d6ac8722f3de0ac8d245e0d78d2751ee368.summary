@entity1 could have a separate income tax rate to @entity3 under radical new reforms which will be introduced within 100 days of a @entity6 election victory , @entity0 announced today			1
the prime minister pledged to deliver effective ‘ home rule ’ for @entity1 - giving mps the same powers to set tax rates which have been agreed for @entity3 following last year 's independent referendum			1
mr @entity0 said in the interests of fairness @entity1 mps must be given a veto on legislation that no longer applies in @entity3			1
it will mean @entity1 , @entity25 and @entity27 mps being able to set a separate rate of income tax to that in @entity3 – where the @entity44 is expected to hold sway after the election – with mps north of the border having no say			1
if @entity25 votes in favour of the @entity52 having income tax powers like those being devolved to @entity55 in a proposed referendum , @entity47 would also be excluded			2
the plan will involve reforming @entity59 ’s committee stage , where @entity47 discuss legislation in detail			0
no @entity62 or part of a @entity62 relating only to @entity1 would be able to pass to its third reading and become law without being approved in a ‘ grand committee ’ made up of all @entity1 mps			0
the plan is likely to trigger a row with @entity71 , which opposes the idea of an @entity1 veto			0
mr @entity0 helps build an industrial fan during a campaign visit in @entity76 in @entity77 this afternoon the prime minister 's visit came as he courted @entity1 voters with an election pledge to create a separate rate of income tax for @entity1 the party has traditionally relied on the votes of its army of @entity3 mps at @entity88 , which it used to implement tuition fees and foundation hospitals even though they did not apply in @entity3			1
@entity71 ’s leader in @entity3 @entity92 yesterday claimed mr @entity0 was ‘ cheap ’ , ‘ nasty ’ and an ‘ election agent ’ for the @entity44 in @entity3			1
‘ he has given up on the @entity3 @entity6 party and is throwing his lot in with the @entity44			2
@entity0 is the agent and the campaign manager for the @entity44 , ’ mr @entity92 said			2
but mr @entity0 , speaking @entity98 , said : ‘ we do not support @entity1 nationalists , we do not want an @entity59 , we are the @entity6 and @entity101 through and through			1
‘ this manifesto simply recognises that the democratic picture has got more complicated in the @entity104 , so beyond our main manifesto , @entity1 voters deserve one document , clarifying in black and white what they can expect			2
‘ soon , the @entity55 will be voting to set its own levels of income tax – and rightly so – but that has clear implications			1
@entity1 mps will be unable to vote on the income tax paid by people in @entity115 and @entity116 while @entity3 mps are able to vote on the tax you pay in @entity119 or @entity120 or @entity121			1
and with @entity1 votes for @entity1 laws we will put it right			0
’ former foreign secretary @entity21 added : ‘ this is not a vague promise to make this change some time in the future , this is a plan ready to be implemented			0
‘ we will table our proposals within the first hundred days after the general election			0
and after consultation with the procedure committee of the @entity134 and running a pilot test of the new rules , we will fully implement our plan within the first year of the new @entity59 and apply it to the @entity138			0
’ other commitments in the @entity141 ' @entity1 manifesto ' include a commitment to spend more on the @entity143 in real terms every year , deliver a ’ truly seven - day @entity143 ’ and keep the @entity145 , which pays for expensive treatments on the @entity143			1
it also promises to give more schools in @entity1 freedoms so they are in charge of their own affairs , continue to allow charities , teachers and universities to set up new schools in the state sector , and keep school league tables			0
commuter rail fares in @entity1 will be frozen for five years , and working parents of three and four - year - olds will get 30 hours a week free childcare			0
the right to buy will be extended to all housing association tenants in @entity1 , and 200,000 new ‘ starter homes ’ will be offered at 20 per cent below the market price for first - time buyers under 40			0
mr @entity0 added : ‘ my message to people who want these things , who want their own home , more childcare , an @entity143 protected and their taxes cut , is : there is only one way to guarantee it : vote @entity6 on may 7			1
a vote for anyone else makes an @entity179 - @entity44 government more likely – which will put all these things at risk			0
only a strong conservative @entity178 will deliver for you and your family			0
’ one of @entity179 ’s close allies , former cabinet minister @entity186 , urged the @entity71 leader to issue an ‘ @entity1 manifesto ’ , but the party has not done so .			2

the @entity141 publish a separate ' @entity1 manifesto ' for the first time
mr @entity0 said delivering ' home rule ' for @entity1 is a top priority
@entity6 government will introduce the new system before march 2016 budget
it will allow @entity202 set separate rate of income tax to @entity3
