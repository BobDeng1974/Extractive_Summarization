the loss of @entity1 highlights rights in the @entity4 auction could trigger the departure of star football presenter @entity6 from the @entity7			1
@entity8 have coveted @entity9 as their @entity11 host since they won the rights from @entity13 in november 2013 in a three - year agreement with @entity15 that starts next season			1
and initial approaches were said to have been made to @entity9 last summer			2
but @entity8 are waiting until the outcome of the @entity4 rights tender next month before making their big move for the former @entity22 and @entity23 striker , who has established himself as the @entity7 ’s top sports anchor			1
losing @entity1 would leave the corporation with too little football to justify @entity9 ’s seven - figure salary			2
@entity1 presenter @entity6 could leave the @entity7 if they lose the rights to @entity4 highlights @entity6 , who also works for @entity31 network @entity30 , is contracted exclusively to the @entity7 for one more season in the @entity33 in a deal that runs concurrently with their @entity1 rights			1
but it is possible that agreement could be re-negotiated were the @entity7 to lose their highlights show , allowing @entity9 to present football on the @entity7 and @entity8 in a similar scenario that allows @entity41 to work for the two networks			1
@entity8 , having spent an astonishing £ 897million on capturing the @entity11 want to make some big signings - and @entity9 fits the bill			1
prince @entity45 can at least count on some family advice about the murky world of sports politics in his uphill battle to usurp @entity51 as @entity53 president			1
@entity45 ’s half - brother prince @entity54 is the head of the @entity57 @entity56 while sister @entity58 , wife of racing overlord @entity59 , is a two - term president of the international equestrian federation			0
but unfortunately for @entity45 , the biggest sports powerbroker in the @entity63 , @entity66 - @entity65 ’s president of the @entity67 and the kingmaker for @entity56 president @entity69 - has come out strongly in support of @entity51			2
prince @entity45 ( left ) will run against @entity51 ( right ) in the @entity53 presidency election football agent @entity72 lost a long legal battle in september with @entity74 and the @entity75 and @entity76 over claims he was cut out of the £ 1million transfer of @entity79 from @entity80 in 2007			1
but eight years on , the dogged @entity72 , buoyed by the judge calling the result ‘ unfortunate ’ and describing @entity79 as being ‘ clearly untruthful ’ and @entity74 chairman @entity84 ’s evidence ‘ unsatisfactory ’ , is pursuing private prosecutions against @entity74 , @entity79 , @entity87 former manager @entity86 as well as former @entity90 agents @entity88 , @entity91 and @entity92			0
@entity79 says he has a district judge ruling for summons to be issued based on his submitted information			0
@entity74 say they have heard nothing and have no case to answer			0
football agent @entity72 lost a long legal battle over the transfer of @entity79 from @entity80 to @entity74 the @entity101 discussed sending a representative to the @entity53 reform summit in @entity104 on january 21 , but decided against it			2
they did not want their involvement to add extra credence to the event , which is organised by @entity111 mp @entity110			0
but the @entity113 noise from @entity114 does suit the @entity101 agenda			0
the @entity101 discussed sending a representative to the @entity53 reform summit in @entity104 , but decided against it @entity13 fury at cricket chiefs @entity121 ’ high command are said to be incandescent about county cricket chiefs campaigning for the return of the sport to terrestrial tv to arrest declining participation and poor @entity128 crowds when there is no appetite among free - to - air networks for live cricket			1
@entity13 spend £ 67million each year bankrolling the game which allowed the @entity134 to lavish hundreds of thousands of pounds on the bizarre # rise marketing campaign during the @entity137 series in 2013			0
they have also brought in another agency , @entity138 , to look at fresh ways of branding the @entity23 team for this summer ’s ashes			0
@entity23 coach @entity142 is understood to have been enthusiastic about the re-branding investment			0
and the counties were behind an elongated domestic t20 competition that has n’t worked compared with an exciting , and shorter , @entity146 , or @entity147 involving the world ’s best players			0
@entity121 are incandescent about county cricket chiefs campaigning to have the sport back on terrestrial tv @entity8 say their latest promo - ‘ the cool people to watch football with ’ - featuring a swaggering @entity156 - style @entity157 , @entity158 , @entity159 and @entity160 , is meant to be tongue - in - cheek			1
but @entity160 ’s thumbs - up at the end could n’t be bettered by @entity164 , it ’s that crass			0
@entity8 's latest advert , although supposed to be tongue - in - cheek , is embarrassing nonetheless			2

@entity6 is wanted by @entity8 for their @entity11 coverage
@entity6 could leave @entity7 if they lose rights to @entity4 highlights
