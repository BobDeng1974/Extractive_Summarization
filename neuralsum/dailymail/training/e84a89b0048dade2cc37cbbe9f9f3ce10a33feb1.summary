by @entity0 correspondent tenderly gazing over her infant son ’s beribboned crib , it is study in royal portraiture			2
taken by legendary @entity9 photographer , sir @entity8 , this is the first official portrait of future king @entity10 , shot at @entity11 in december 1948 , when he was just a month old			1
fast forward more than thirty years , and a rather startled - looking prince @entity12 is introduced to the world by the @entity15 ’s brother - in - law @entity14 , another celebrated society photographer			1
traditional : @entity8 's 1948 photo of the of @entity15 gazing down at @entity10 is a study in royal portraiture formal : prince @entity12 looks rather startled in his 1982 official portrait taken by @entity14 although more relaxed than those featuring the @entity15 , they are still formal , studio portraits of a future king and his queen , proudly showing off the next generation of the family line			1
given the illustrious history of recent royal family portraits , the @entity27 and @entity28 of @entity30 ’s decision to use one of proud grandpa @entity33 ’s happy family snaps in the family backgarden – complete with pets - is a definite break with tradition			1
and , inevitably , there will be those that feel that shots do not carry the gravitas normally expected of a formal family portrait			1
according to well - placed royal sources , however , the decision was very much @entity12 and @entity28 ’s			1
‘ it ’s just where they feel happy and most comfortable , ’ said an aide			0
‘ they are a young couple who have just had their first baby			0
there has been huge demand from the public to see some official photographs of @entity60			1
it seemed perfectly natural to them to pose for a few nice family snapshots which they could then issue			0
’ relaxed : the @entity27 and @entity28 chose to release an intimate family portrait of @entity60 seen it before ? mr @entity33 's pictures of the @entity69 on the grass in his @entity72 garden echo those of the young @entity12 taken in the grounds of @entity75 in @entity76 , @entity77 it is also understood that neither @entity12 or @entity28 , who were most recently photographed by celebrated fashion photographer @entity79 for their official engagement portrait , were keen not to ‘ burst the happily little family bubble ’ they have existed in at the @entity84 home since @entity87 ’s birth			1
‘ inviting in a well - known society portraitist or a professional photographer is a very formal experience and one they were n’t keen to go through at this early stage , ’ said a source			2
‘ the fact is that the formal portraits will all come when @entity60 is christened in a few months ’ time			2
‘ and as no - one knows when his first official engagement , so to speak , will be , it was sensible to release a few pictures to say thank you for all the public support they have received			2
’ the @entity103 also understands that the couple were keen to take the wind out of the sails of the huge - and extremely lucrative - international market for unofficial paparazzi pictures of @entity87 by releasing their own at the earliest opportunity			0
family affair : sources said they did not want a professional to ' burst the happy little family bubble ' ‘ but the most important thing was that they genuinely felt much more comfortable having these shots taken by a member of their family , ’ the source said			2
not always formal : this 1983 shot shows a more relaxed prince @entity10 and princess @entity123 with their young son @entity12 a senior royal aide also made clear that the couple had been keen to issue a set of pictures as a mark of thanks for the privacy they had been given immediately after the birth of their son			1
‘ they asked the media to give them some time as a family – that was hugely important to them - and @entity144 media have done that , ’ they added			0
renowned celebrity photographer @entity146 , who has photographed almost every member of the royal family , ranging from the @entity15 and princess @entity149 to @entity150 and more recently the then @entity28 , described the decision as ‘ rather refreshing ’			2
he told the @entity103 : ‘ it ’s an unusual decision but perhaps reflects the young approach that prince @entity12 wants to bring to bear			1
‘ of course the pictures are historic and the decision to take them in such an informal manner means they , perhaps , lack the level of gravitas that would normally be expected			0
‘ but on the whole i would say this is quite refreshing			0
’ he added : ‘ taking a professional portrait of a young baby is quite an intrusive procedure , given the lighting and strobes you would need			0
' i have to say i would never normally take a photograph of a baby under six weeks old , and this little one is just three			0
‘ so perhaps they have had the right idea after all			0
' and who is to say it ’s wrong ? it ’s just a refreshingly different approach			0

@entity60 's first official portrait is a break with royal tradition
