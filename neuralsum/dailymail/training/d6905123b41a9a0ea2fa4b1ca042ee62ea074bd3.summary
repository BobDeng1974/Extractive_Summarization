by @entity0 last updated at 8:05 pm on 14th january 2012 ' scapegoat ' : the @entity2 , claims it is the victim of a conspiracy by surgeons who want to see it out of business a @entity9 clinic at the centre of the breast implant scare has said the taxpayer should foot the bill to help its patients			1
the multi-million - pound cosmetic surgery business , which fitted more @entity17 implants than any other @entity19 firm , also claimed it will need a @entity21 loan if it is to help the @entity22			1
@entity23 , owner of the @entity2 , said his firm had been made a ‘ scapegoat ’ in the saga and was the victim of a conspiracy by other surgeons who want to see him out of business			1
the chain is currently deluged with around 2,000 calls a day from women , most of whom want their implants removed			1
the group , which had a turnover of more than £ 30million in 2009 , fitted @entity17 implants in 13,900 women between september 2001 and 2010			1
this is around one in three of the 45,000 sold			0
mr @entity23 said the business did not have the money , time or space to remove and replace all the implants – and the @entity22 should step in			2
booming business : the group fitted @entity17 implants in 13,900 women between september 2001 and 2010 he said the chain of 31 clinics , like its patients , was an ‘ innocent victim ’ of a regulatory failure , and said it was ‘ outrageous ’ of the government to call on private clinics to take responsibility			1
his comments have caused fury among mps , patients , surgeons and lawyers , who say a clinic ’s first duty is to its patients , not its profits			2
they came as health secretary @entity69 announced spot checks on plastic surgery clinics and a wide - ranging review of cosmetic surgery practices from nose jobs and laser surgery to injections used to iron out wrinkles			2
when @entity79 had her breasts enlarged , she was thrilled with the results			0
now , four years later and pregnant , the mother of two could n't be more unhappy with them			0
scans show that one – or both – of the @entity17 implants have ruptured			1
but , at five - and - a - half - months pregnant , @entity87 , 39 , of @entity88 in @entity89 , has been advised against surgery to have them out			2
miss @entity79 paid @entity2 £ 5,000 for breast augmentation after enduring years of low self - esteem due to her small bust			2
last year she started experiencing burning pains , and then found lumps in her breasts , raising fears of cancer			0
she now suffers stabbing pains – but has been advised not to have the ruptured implants out when pregnant			2
miss @entity79 believes the @entity2 should pay to remove and replace the implants after she has her baby			2
she added : ' it is their fault this happened			0
i went there in full confidence			0
if it was up to me , i 'd have the implants out right now			0
i worry because i do n't know what was in them			0
' mr @entity69 also pointed the finger at @entity115 , by naming it as the country that approved the @entity119 - made @entity118 for use in @entity121			1
industry experts say that the combination of cut - price implants and low payments to surgeons would have allowed clinics using @entity118 to make an extra profit of up to £ 1,000 per patient			1
tests have confirmed that @entity17 implants , which are extra-fragile and filled with industrial - grade silicone believed to have been made for mattresses , do not cause cancer			1
however , the @entity134 admits they should never have been put in the human body and the health secretary has cleared the way for all women who want them removed to have it done			1
last friday , mr @entity69 said private clinics have a ‘ moral duty ’ to take them out and if they do n’t , the @entity22 will step in			0
however , the pledge does n’t include the replacement of implants			0
many private chains have agreed to help their patients free of charge but two of the largest groups have ignored mr @entity69 ’s call			0
transform , @entity19 ’s biggest cosmetic surgery group , is ‘ reviewing its options ’			1
but as it stands , it is charging patients £ 2,800 to replace @entity17 implants			1
the @entity2 has so far removed and replaced ruptured implants for free – but only if they were fitted in the past two years			1
mr @entity23 , who previously ran a travel agency in @entity158 , said his business could n’t cope with the panic from its patients			0
he said : ‘ we do n’t have the number of surgeons , the hospitals and the anaesthetists and we do n’t have the financial capacity to do it for nothing			0
‘ we do roughly 5,000 to 6,000 operations a year and are not capable of adding another 13,900 on top of that			0
’ instead , he wants the @entity22 to take the implants out – and put new ones in when the woman is on the operating table			0
mr @entity23 wants the @entity176 to pay for the bulk of the costs			0
the firm would pay for new implants – but would need a loan from the government			1
the government however said it would be ‘ irresponsible ’ of the @entity2 not to help its patients			0
@entity192 , president of the @entity193 , said : ‘ we find it outrageous … when women ’s peace of mind is at stake , some clinics are refusing to honour their ostensible commitment to duty of care , particularly when they made a profit by using cheaper products and resources			2
’ @entity201 authorities have reversed their earlier advice on @entity118 and said women who had the implants should have them removed .			1

the clinic - which fitted more @entity17 implants than any other @entity19 firm - says it has been made a ' scapegoat ' in the saga
the chain is currently deluged with 2,000 calls a day from women wanting implants removed
