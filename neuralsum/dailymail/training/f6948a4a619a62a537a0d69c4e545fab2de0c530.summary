@entity0 has warned @entity1 that he must make more of an impact at club and international level if he wants to keep his place in the @entity6 starting xv			1
the @entity9 coach yesterday fuelled speculation that @entity11 , 22 , will be named on the bench for the @entity14 opener against @entity15 , suggesting that @entity17 winger @entity16 could be handed the starting jersey @entity11 burst on to the international scene as a teenager and has since started 47 out of his 48 tests			1
however , @entity0 has hinted he could stick to the winning formula that beat @entity23 in november , when @entity11 was sidelined with concussion			1
@entity6 boss @entity0 has said he wants to see more of @entity25 's @entity1 on the ball the 22 - year - old has featured in 47 of 48 @entity28 but could start on the bench against @entity15 @entity6 captain @entity30 ( left ) and @entity0 pose with the 2015 @entity14 trophy ‘ @entity25 have the same issues with @entity33 , having spoken to [ backs coach ] @entity34 about touching the ball more , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ we want to see more touches and have the ball in his hands			2
when he does that , he is dangerous and makes some metres for us			2
‘ if you are a player who has won against @entity23 and started the game , then it ’s sometimes difficult for that player to be dropped			1
we wo n’t sit down as a coaching team until monday or tuesday and start talking about a team			2
we will see how players front up			2
it ’s a nice position for us to be in and we have options			0
’ @entity11 has been a key component in @entity6 ’s physical style of play – commonly referred to as ‘ @entity55 ’ – while @entity16 is a much less powerful athlete			1
collisions are getting bigger in the test arena and @entity0 admitted that his side will direct their heavy ball - carriers , especially inside - centre @entity60 , towards fly - half @entity61 , who is one of @entity15 ’s smallest players			1
‘ people target the 10 channel in modern international rugby , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ outside - halves are physically one of the smallest players on the field			0
we are no different to anyone else and it ’s part of the game now			0
@entity60 could make a start for @entity76 's side after impressing against @entity23 ‘ @entity60 was outstanding on the weekend against @entity25			1
one of the positives about our players in @entity80 is they have not played too much rugby , so they are pretty fresh and looking forward to the @entity14			0
’ @entity0 is ‘ hopeful ’ that tight - head prop @entity84 will recover from a neck injury in time for the opening test at the @entity87			1
the 22 - year - old has emerged as one of the world ’s best young scrummagers , with his fitness becoming increasingly important following the shock retirement of veteran @entity94			0
‘ i was surprised at the timing [ of @entity94 ’s announcement ] , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ i thought he might have waited until the end of the season , because the door was n’t closed for him			0
he has made the decision and his contribution to @entity104 rugby has been immense			0
‘ what he has achieved in our game is tremendous and there was a time where he was the first name on the team sheet			0
he has won three @entity112 , another @entity14 and a @entity114 tour			0
’ plying his trade in @entity80 , the @entity116 player will be fresh heading into the @entity14			0
