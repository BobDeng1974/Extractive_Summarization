by @entity0 published : 07:27 est , 3 july 2013 updated : 09:00 est , 3 july 2013 a movie - loving pensioner has brought the big screen to his home by building the world ’s smallest cinema in his bedroom			1
@entity8 , 73 , has created a makeshift movie theatre with big screens , cinema seats and classic projectors			1
the old - style cinema features red curtains which draw back when a film starts , just like at the flicks , and a classic projector shining onto the wall , complete with the clicking of the reel as it plays			1
he also has another projector is in his living room to get the full movie effect as well as scores of large film reels adorning the walls of his home			1
mr @entity8 , 73 , from @entity50 , @entity51 , said : ' i call it the minimum cinema because it is probably the smallest cinema in the world that uses all professional equipment			1
' when i stand by the projector when it ’s running and i am looking through the small port hole which is only five foot down to the screen it ’s just like sitting in a full size projection room looking at the real thing			1
' ' just like the reel thing ' : mr @entity8 with the projector and the dozens of films he has collected over the years classic : the projector used in @entity8 's private cinema at his house in @entity50 , @entity51 mr @entity8 said : ' when i am looking through the small port hole , it 's just like sitting in a full - size projection room looking at the real thing ' lifelong passion : mr @entity8 used to splice together old film reels , repair and maintain the machines when working in the cinemas years ago despite being in a tiny converted bedroom , the cinema boasts four original cinema seats he salvaged when a local cinema closed down , with the projector showing films to the scale they were originally screened to large audiences			1
no tickets are needed when friends and fellow cinema enthusiasts come to see the historic equipment in action , which he picked up for a bargain when commercial cinemas closed			1
one of the @entity96 projectors was made disposable when cinemas switched to digital while the other is capable of playing dvds			0
' i was quite lucky to get these projectors - it takes me back to the 50s , 60s , and 70s			0
i ’m up here quite a lot			0
if i could live up here 24/7 i would			0
i like cleaning the projector down , ' he added			2
