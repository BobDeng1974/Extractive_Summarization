to be fair , no one looks at their radiant best after a transatlantic flight			0
and so those new pictures of @entity5 , in which she looks pale , swollen and not quite the @entity7 beauty we would recognise from her publicity shots , may simply be a familiar story of a tiring night , crossing time zones without enough sleep or water			1
nevertheless , she does appear very changed			0
and perhaps inevitably yesterday , on message boards across the globe , her looks were a matter of earnest debate			0
the use of @entity20 and fillers , which can combine to give a frozen and puffy appearance , was widely suspected — and indeed in many places asserted as fact			0
another said : ‘ the curse of pillow face strikes again ! ’ one brave soul ventured to ask @entity5 directly on @entity36 : ‘ what have you done to your gorgeous face ? ’ the @entity5 ’s reply ? ‘ nothing ! damage caused by long - haul flight ! ’ now , it is true that she has suffered in the past from a puffy face			1
last year she was pictured getting into her car wearing a de-puffing white cotton pad under each eye — hardly the most flattering look			0
it is also known that @entity5 has a high - maintenance beauty regime — facials , silk pillows , fancy creams and the rest — which allows her often to pass for a woman two decades younger			1
@entity5 appearing at court after her former assistants the @entity59 sisters were charged with fraud and the fact is that it is vital for her to look her very best right now			1
for she is planning to make a comeback in the @entity67 after the success of her @entity70 tv show and plans for a book and a tv series here are already well - advanced			1
in the next few months she will deliver a manuscript to publisher @entity76			0
when the book , simply @entity5 , comes out and she is back on @entity67 television , she will be able to tell if the scandals of 2013 have dented her image			2
this , then , is a testing time for @entity5			2
there is a sense that she will face a moment of truth around the corner			0
most tv and publishing executives believe she has emerged from her shattering divorce from art collector @entity91 and the trial for fraud of her former assistants , the @entity59 sisters , even more beloved than ever			1
@entity95 has many supporters , ranging from her close friends actor @entity97 , author @entity98 , heiress @entity99 and broadcaster @entity100 , to a wider fan base including @entity102 , who was famously reprimanded by the judge when he declaring that he was on her side during the @entity106 ’ trial			2
people close to @entity5 say she is ‘ very calm ’ on the subject of whether she can still make a go of her career , and exhibits not a trace of nerves on the subject			1
‘ she said she ca n’t understand the fuss , ’ said a confidant			2
she is , though , skittish about her looks and ageing			0
posing for the cover of @entity120 last march , she admitted being ‘ terrified ’ of being pictured without make - up			1
‘ i hate having my looks talked up , ’ she added			1
‘ it always makes me feel i ’m going to be a disappointment in the flesh			0
’ as well as the appearance of her face seeming to change , @entity5 's weight has fluctuated over the years that she has been in the public eye she was wrong , of course — she looked gorgeous in @entity120 and the magazine claimed only a light touch of the airbrush had been needed			1
in real life , though , @entity5 ’s hair is often less kempt than one might expect — she washes it only once a week			2
as far as skincare goes , she likes @entity139 facial massage and products			0
and @entity20 ? she denies it had anything to do with her appearance this week			0
in addition , @entity5 , whose weight famously yo - yos , sees a personal trainer in @entity148 who also trains @entity149			1
this would be a very normal beauty regime for a 54 - year - old woman in the public eye			1
@entity5 understands that her famous looks are part of her appeal			1
the tv cook is savvy enough to know that her looks play a large part in her success if she wants to continue to sell books and make tv shows , she has to attend to her image — and she has no intention of retiring			1
although she is said to be worth £ 15 million , some of her accounts show a surprisingly modest income			0
figures from @entity169 — which analyses publishing sales — show that her income from physical books this year is small — at least by the standards of a woman who , it was revealed at the @entity106 ’ trial , lived in a house where £ 25,000 was spent on flowers in 18 months			1
her books in print — including those reissued this spring in new jackets as the ‘ @entity183 ’ — have notched up £ 170,000 in sales			2
she might expect to get 60 per cent of this , which is around £ 100,000 , on which , of course , she will have to pay tax			0
that does n’t amount to much if you live a life as expensive as @entity5 ’s , with a team of staff and daily visits to the best fishmonger and greengrocer in @entity198			2
she makes more money — estimated to be ‘ at least ’ £ 500,000 a year — from sales of her @entity202 homewares , e-book sales and her recipe app. her tv production company , @entity205 , is in rude health , with assets of nearly £ 3 million			1
its latest accounts , showing the year to august 2013 , reveal pre-tax profits of £ 498,000			0
so @entity5 has plenty to smile about , and it is clear she is loving life without her famously controlling ex-spouse			2
free from @entity91 , she is going out to dinner parties and other events			0
she was spotted at a performance in @entity217 given by burlesque dancer @entity218 — and afterwards posed for a picture with @entity220			0
she posted it on @entity36 , saying : ‘ difficult to have your picture taken next to the most exquisite creature on earth			0
’ broadcaster @entity100 and documentary - maker @entity226 are her two main stalwarts , and her tv producer sister @entity229 is also in her inner circle			1
perhaps significantly , there is a growing coterie of male admirers , too , all of whom worship at the altar of @entity5			2
@entity98 , who has taken her out for dinner in @entity148 , has adored her for more than a decade , but their relationship has always been platonic			0
@entity5 with burlesque artist @entity218 who she described as ' the most exquisite creature on earth ' then there is the life coach @entity241 , whom friends say she ‘ could n’t do without ’			1
during the trial of the @entity59 sisters in december , it was revealed that he gave @entity5 therapy and was also engaged to help her staff — the so - called @entity248 — to work through their problems			1
@entity241 , a tall , handsome man , lives with his business partner @entity251 — again there is no question of a romantic liaison			0
instead , he is coaching @entity5 , perennially anxious , about confidence in her personal and professional relationships			2
the final key ‘ knight ’ for @entity5 is tv cook @entity257 , her co-host on @entity70 television			1
he is enormously loyal to her , as he has made clear to their bosses at @entity262 who have had their doubts			0
@entity5 has emerged stronger from her trials and tribulations over the past year , partly due to @entity95 which includes actor @entity97 and heiress @entity99 when she was banned from entering the @entity70 because of her past drug use , he tweeted : ‘ i am absolutely mortified with embarrassment over the cruelty and hypocrisy of @entity70 actions re : # @entity5 travel			1
’ @entity257 , who is happily married , has the kind of global profile which @entity5 envies			2
while in @entity217 , she was filming @entity275 with @entity257 — the show is now in its third series in @entity70 but failed to get traction on @entity279 when it was trialled over here			0
other new members of her circle are the once troubled @entity283 actor @entity282 , who asks her for pie recipes , and @entity285 , actress and writer of the hit @entity70 tv show girls			0
and so , with friends in high places , a new publishing deal and tv appearances on both sides of the @entity293 , @entity5 marches on			1
in the circumstances , who could blame her for looking a little strained ?			0
