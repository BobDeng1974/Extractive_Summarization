soldiers regard the @entity50 as a priceless part of their history			1
@entity1 foreign ministry spokesman @entity53 said they have not yet decided whether to sell the property			1
' i want to make it clear to you that the government has not taken any decision , so it all depends on the recommendation of the team , ' he told the @entity63			0
' @entity64 to die than be a coward ' is the motto of the world - famous @entity1 @entity6 soldiers who are an integral part of the @entity69			1
they still carry into battle their traditional weapon - an 18 - inch long curved knife known as the kukri			0
after suffering heavy casualties in the invasion of @entity1 , the @entity75 signed a peace deal in 1815 , which allowed it to recruit from the ranks of the former enemy			2

more than 200,000 fought in the two world wars , and in the past 50 years they have served in @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 , the @entity95 , @entity96 and now in @entity97 and @entity98			0

toilets do n't flush , the roof needs repairs and visa applicants are greeted by the sound of pressure cooker whistles from upstairs			0

the entrance hall and the grand staircase are quite extraordinary			0
for sale ? the @entity1 government have sent a committee to @entity4 to consider selling off the exclusive property ' it is evident that in its heyday this property was one of the grandest mansions in the capital but very little has been spent on it in the interim and it does appear to be stuck in a time warp			1
' the property will probably need considerable restoration and refurbishment that could mean anything up to £ 40 million			2
' with all the embassies in the road , security is probably higher than any other private road in the @entity16			2
this is why it is so sought after amongst oligarchs who crave their privacy and protection			0
' the mansions in the road are surrounded with sizeable gardens and that is unique in central @entity4			0
' of course , once you exit this road you are literally in the centre of @entity4			0
' since there are very few properties in this road available at any time , of the few people able to afford it , there could certainly be a bidding war			0
' @entity187 , director of @entity188 , added : ' the house is spectacular and worth £ 100 million - plus			0
there will be no shortage of interest			0
' with house values on @entity8 standing at around £ 6,000sq/ft , a fully restored @entity44 could be worth around £ 180 million			1
