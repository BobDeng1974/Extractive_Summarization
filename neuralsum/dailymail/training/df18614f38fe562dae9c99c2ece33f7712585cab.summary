the number of people in the @entity2 has risen by five million over the past 12 years , growing faster than anywhere else in @entity4			1
last year , the population soared by more than 400,000 to pass 64million for the first time , according to the @entity7			1
estimates released yesterday show that from 2001 to 2013 , the population went up by five million			1
the previous five million increase took three times as long , over 37 years between 1964 and 2001			2
the figures reveal the rapid change since @entity14 ’s open - door immigration policy under @entity15 fuelled a population explosion			1
@entity17 started to pick up in the late 1990s , after years in which net migration stayed well below 100,000 – to which prime minister @entity20 has pledged to return it			2
net migration is the total change when all those entering and leaving the country are counted up			2
many fear soaring numbers are placing a gathering strain on key services such as housing , health , education and transport			0
if this rate of growth continues , @entity2 will hit the landmark 70million mark – the level some analysts believe will overstretch resources – by the late 2020s			0
last year , the population soared by more than 400,000 to pass 64million for the first time the @entity7 said that in mid- 2013 , there were 400,600 more people than a year earlier , equivalent to a city the size of @entity45			1
immigration was directly responsible for 46 per cent of that rise			2
migrants also play a major role in the current baby boom , with one in four infants now born to a mother who was born abroad			0
other @entity4 countries have fallen far behind			0
both @entity54 and @entity55 saw their populations rise by 291,000 in the year to mid- 2013 , while @entity58 , the only other country over the 100,000 level , saw a rise of 196,000			1
@entity61 , of the @entity7 , said @entity2 net migration for the year was 183,400 , while an excess of births over deaths added more than 212,000 extra people			1
he said : ‘ births were down on last year but still above average for the decade			1
deaths have risen since last year , and are slightly higher than the decade average			1
’ @entity72 , of the pressure group @entity73 , said : ‘ population growth on this scale is clearly unsustainable and raises serious questions about the ability of public services and infrastructure to cope			2
‘ the government will have to build schools , gp surgeries , hospitals and homes			0
when there is very little money to spare			0
’ @entity88 , of campaign group @entity87 , said : ‘ economic growth does not improve living standards if the benefit has to be spread across ever more people			0
’ the government should push for ‘ balanced ’ migration and smaller families , he added			0
in the 30 years before 2001 , immigration was responsible for just 12 per cent of population growth			1
but in the peak year of 2005 , it accounted for almost 70 per cent of growth as @entity2 ’s labour market was opened to @entity101 and seven other new @entity103 members , attracting more than a million @entity104			1
net migration was 48,000 in 1997 , but by 2001 had more than trebled to 171,000 , with record arrivals from @entity107 and @entity108 and a boom in asylum claims			0
over the next decade , net migration was consistently higher than 200,000			0
one insider has said mass migration under @entity14 was a deliberate tactic			0
former @entity15 adviser @entity115 wrote in 2009 that , from 2000 : ‘ i remember coming away from some discussions with the clear sense that the policy was intended – even if this was n’t its main purpose – to rub the @entity122 ’s nose in diversity			0
’ the @entity7 said of the figures : ‘ since 2001 there have been high levels of net inward immigration , adding to the population at younger working ages			2
‘ in part this was driven by the expansion of the @entity103 in 2004 and 2007			1
this period has also seen an increasing number of births , driven by both the immigration of women of childbearing age and rising fertility among @entity2 - born women			2
’ @entity142 ’s population grew the most , the @entity7 said , by 0.7 per cent in a year to 53.9million			1
@entity143 ’s went up 0.27 per cent to 5.3million , with similar increases in @entity145 , which has 3.1million people , and @entity147 , at 1.8million			0
@entity148 was the fastest - growing region , with 108,000 extra people .			0

population grows by 400,000 , the same as a city the size of @entity45
0.63 *%* rise in 12 months is one of the highest in all of the @entity103
*biggest* driver was births *outstripping* deaths , accounting for 212,000
183,400 more immigrants arrived than *emigrants* left in year to june 2013
