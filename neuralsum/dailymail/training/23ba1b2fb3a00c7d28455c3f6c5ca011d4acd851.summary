by @entity1 reporter published : 14:13 est , 8 september 2012 updated : 14:13 est , 8 september 2012 though no stranger to crude humour , several tweets by @entity6 star @entity5 have gotten him in hot water			1
during last week ’s @entity8 , he made several extremely vulgar tweets about the wives of presidential candidate @entity11 and vice presidential candidate @entity12 , causing an outcry on the microblogging site			1
and because @entity5 now works for children ’s entertainment network @entity18 as the voice of @entity20 in the upcoming @entity22 series , the company was forced to issue an apology			1
but unlike those millions , he tweeted a series of extremely vulgar things about the candidates ’ wives			2
@entity37 has chosen to not publish images of the tweets , which have since been deleted from @entity5 ’ account			2
the official publicity twitter account to @entity22 mentioned @entity5 ’ account on september 1 , encouraging followers to visit his site			1

on wednesday , @entity18 issued a statement on the drama , saying : ‘ the offensive comments made by @entity5 last week on his personal twitter account do not reflect our company ’s views or values , and we condemn them			1
inappropriate : @entity5 was forced to take the vulgar tweets about @entity31 , left , and @entity66 , right , down from his @entity68 site , which was linked to the @entity70 promotional @entity68 feed bye bye @entity6 : @entity5 is perhaps most famous for his roles in the crude @entity6 comedy franchaise ‘ @entity18 does not support or condone the use of graphic or vulgar language on any of our platforms			1
it was our mistake to link from our @entity22 twitter feed to @entity5 ’s personal twitter account , and we quickly corrected our error			0
‘ we also insisted @entity5 use better judgment and discretion in public communications while affiliated with our brand			2
’ but that apology was n’t good enough for @entity45 , who said on air after the statement was released : ‘ does that do it ? it ’s not like he made one comment that he can dial back			0
’ @entity94 ’s groups have since been lobbying for advertisers on the show to pull their support			0
a similar issue popped up last year after parent ’s groups took a target on another @entity102 - owned station , @entity103			0
