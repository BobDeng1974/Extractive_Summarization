by @entity0 published : 06:31 est , 1 february 2013 updated : 07:56 est , 1 february 2013 @entity1 may have been removed from the list of ' approved celebrities ' sent dresses from @entity6 's collection , according to reports , but that did n't stop the classical singer wowing in the bright blue number yesterday			1
however , at £ 1,650 , the cobalt blue pencil dress for @entity6 's @entity13 collection is n't within most fashionistas ' budgets			1
but @entity16 have found a near exact match and it will only set you back £ 79			1
get the look : @entity1 was spotted in the cobalt blue @entity22 dress , and while hers comes with a price tag of £ 1,650 , an online fashion retailer is offering a near match for £ 79 @entity26 and proper : the cobalt blue dress features black collars and cuffs and a double zip on the back the £ 79 figure hugging dress is available at online fashion retailer @entity34 and could be mistaken for @entity6 's design itself ( minus the hefty price tag )			1
@entity37 specialise in celebrity fashion trends and clothes inspired by the season 's key looks			2
the site describe themselves as a ' destination for fashion - savvy women looking for the latest trends at affordable prices			0
' @entity1 was pictured wearing the dress as she left @entity49 yesterday after filming an interview			0
the @entity52 singer sported the look to meet prince @entity54 and @entity55 during a tour of the new @entity58 unit in the @entity59 on the same day			0
@entity60 : the fitted dress certainly flattered @entity1 's figure and @entity6 has also worn her own design previously but used a belt as an extra accesory showcase : @entity6 wore the dress at a @entity69 party in february 2012 - the same month as it was worn by a model at @entity71 dressed to impress : @entity1 wore the dress earlier on thursday to meet prince @entity54 and the @entity73 the fitted dress , which hugged @entity1 's curves in all the right places , was first worn by @entity6 , 38 , at a @entity77 party in @entity69 in february 2012			1
in an interview with the @entity79 a year ago , @entity1 spoke of her love for @entity82 's designs : ' what i love about @entity6 dresses is that they ’re simple in the lines and they do everything to emphasise the female form so it pulls you in the right places and it makes you feel very womanly			2
' the zips are great			0
when you buy an expensive dress , so often the zips go on them , but hers have this double zip			0
she knows what us girls need ! ' @entity1 is n't the only famous fan of @entity6 's shape enhancing dresses			1
@entity105 , @entity106 and @entity107 are all regularly spotted wearing the former @entity109 's designs			0
@entity6 style : ( @entity111 ) @entity1 in a salmon @entity113 creation in february 2012 and sparkling in silver @entity6 in may 2011 snap : @entity1 and @entity6 have often worn the same designs			2
