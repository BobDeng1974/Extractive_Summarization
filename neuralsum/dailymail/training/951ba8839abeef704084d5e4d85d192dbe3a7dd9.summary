if swallowing tablets invokes a fear of choking followed by unpleasant gagging and a nasty taste in the mouth , there is now a little ray of hope			2
while some people suffer the medical condition dysphagia - usually the result of stroke or conditions including multiple sclerosis and @entity14 's - most simply face a mental barrier			0
but scientists in @entity17 believe they may have the devised a new foolproof guide to help people take their medication with ease			2
dr @entity22 , who led the study at the @entity24 , said he believes it will help people who struggle finish full courses of medication			2
scientists believe they may have devised two methods to help people who struggle to take tablets , pictured above are the ' pop bottle ' and ' lean forward ' methods he said around 10 per cent of patients who struggle to swallow use it as an excuse not to take their tablets			1
the study examined 151 adults as they were given 16 differently shaped placebos , totally 283 between them			0
researchers looked at both traditional shaped tablets and capsules / they found for both types , swallowing the pills with at least 20ml of water - around a tablespoon - was most effective			1
after taking each pill the participants rated the ease of swallowing			2
researchers then asked them to try swallowing the tablets and capsules in specific positions , using techniques they had devised			1
they discovered the best way to take chalky tablets is the ' pop bottle ' method			1
@entity63 the researchers discovered the best way to take chalky tablets is the ' pop bottle ' method			1
this is where the tablet is placed on the tongue , the lips are tightly closed around the opening ( of the bottle ) and the tablet is swallowed in a swift suction movement			0
@entity74 here , the ' lean forward ' technique ' is best , the researchers say			1
capsules are swallowed in an upright position with the head bent forward			1
dr @entity22 said choosing which method to use depended on the shape of the medication			0
' capsules , with a density lower than water , will swim in the mouth and so head position matters			0
' in contrast , to swallow tablets , which have almost always higher densities than water , it is necessary to focus on flushing the medicines into the pharynx [ the cone - shaped passageway leading from the nose and mouth towards the oesophagus and voice - box ]			1

however for capsules , the ' lean forward ' technique ' is best , the researchers say			1
here , capsules are swallowed in an upright position with the head bent forward			1
in the study , volunteers were asked to try both methods and rate how easy it was to swallow the pills			0
the ' pop bottle ' technique improved swallowing by 60 per cent , while 88 per cent of those who tried the ' lean forward ' method said it was easier			1
dr @entity22 told the @entity127 : ' both the techniques we describe were remarkably effective in participants with and without reported difficulties in swallowing pills and should be recommended regularly			0

dr @entity22 added that round tablets were found to perform worse			0
the report stated : ' this study showed for the first time that two targeted techniques to facilitate tablet and capsule intake were remarkably effective and easy to adopt in the general population			1
' this included patients with swallowing difficulties , and should therefore be generally recommended			0
' the study was published in the journal @entity166			0
researchers at the @entity24 studied 151 adults taking 16 different placebo pills			2
the ' pill bottle ' method was found best for those taking regular tablets , while the ' lean forward ' technique helped those participants trying to swallow capsule pills			1

researchers from the @entity24 devised two techniques
the ' pill bottle ' method was best for traditional ' chalky ' tablets
people asked to put tablet in mouth and swallow water with sucking motion
' lean forward ' method used to help people swallow drugs in capsule form
taking a *sip* of water people were asked to swallow while bent forward
a tablespoon of water , around 20ml , was found to be the most effective
