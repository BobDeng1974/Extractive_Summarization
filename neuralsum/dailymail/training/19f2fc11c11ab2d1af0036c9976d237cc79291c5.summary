@entity40 's representative @entity39 is one of @entity30 's seven vice presidents and has already said he would support a rerun of the 2022 vote if corruption allegations are proven			2

two secret meetings were brokered between @entity12 royals and an aide to @entity102 's serving @entity8 member to discuss a gas deal in the critical final months before the 2022 ballot , it was reported			2
june 15 : @entity8 ' ignored high terror risk ' further revelations alleged that @entity12 had been deemed at the highest risk of a terrorist attack of any of the 2022 host nations			2
the documents added to questions over how a nation with scorching summer heat and little footballing tradition won the @entity11			0
an unnamed @entity30 member told the newspaper the salary ' doubled to take account of the dropping of the bonus			0
' the newspaper alleged @entity30 members enjoy generous expenses - including stays in a £ 200 - a - night hotel in @entity74 during the @entity68 @entity11 and more than £ 400 a day in generous expenses			0
leaked documents also claimed @entity30 members were allowed to take their salaries in envelopes full of cash at @entity8 's headquarters in @entity132 , @entity17			1
the timing of the revelations , during the current @entity11 in @entity68 , is devastating for mr @entity34 as he remains firmly in the public eye			0
@entity73 authorities are already fighting unrest in large cities including @entity74 over the huge amount spent on the tournament - and the vast profits for @entity8 - in a country with extreme poverty			0
the governing body of world football is highly secretive about the salaries it pays its top officials			1

in a @entity168 interview earlier this month , @entity166 said an inquiry three years ago into the @entity11 bidding process had received several allegations of ' potential corrupt payments '			0
' those were swept aside by @entity8 , they were n't properly investigated , and that was three years ago , ' he said			0
' i do n't think anybody is going to be that amazed to learned that the bid process is corrupted			0
it is n't sufficient just to have a rerun of a vote by a small number of people who conduct the vote in secret and are unaccountable			0
' there needs to be a complete reform of @entity8			0
' a spokesman from @entity8 told @entity189 that football 's governing body was not in a position to comment prior to judge @entity193 's reached his conclusions based on an investigation report due at the end of next month			1
