@entity1 film franchise has grossed over $ 2 billion after three movies - and the final chapter is due out at the end of the year			0
before that , the @entity5 managed $ 3.3 billion over five films from 2008			0
the @entity8 garnered $ 1.5 billion with just one film in 2012 , and there are three other sequels to come , with the follow - up hitting cinemas may 1			0
when it comes to @entity16 's primary concern - banking a major box office - a series or superhero adaptation is largely seen as a surefire success , in a benchmark set in the early 2000 's by @entity22 and @entity23 , and followed by @entity24 and @entity25			1
however , while original screenplays and independent projects are being edged out and overlooked as a result , there is still a small group of stars considered capable of pulling people into theaters in droves			0
according to a new survey in the @entity36 - which called upon producers , agents and executives to list those who can command a major opening based on their fan base - there are six superstars around that can keep the studios swelling , without having to resort to turning a best - selling book or beloved comic into a picture			1
in return , they can ask for $ 20 million per film			1
@entity53 the acting favorite , who won an @entity56 in 2010 for @entity57 , topped @entity59 ' list of the highest - earning actresses in 2014			1

and while her buddy cop comedy @entity70 with @entity71 managed similarly impressive numbers , with about $ 229.9 million worldwide , the powerful pull that @entity53 has today is a career - long achievement			1
thrillers like @entity76 , a time to kill , @entity78 and @entity79 served her well , but @entity53 's legion of loyal fans have really followed her quality comedies and dramas - from while you were sleeping to @entity85 , @entity86 , 28 days , @entity87 and @entity88			2

@entity128 he is perhaps best - known for the @entity130 spy series , which spawned three films from 2002			2
and , despite a shaky return once the series wrapped up , with the disappointing performances of @entity136 , @entity137 , @entity138 , @entity139 , we bought a @entity140 and @entity141 , @entity128 showed once more he is a leading man when not playing @entity130			2
end - of - the - world blockbuster @entity142 became a big movie for @entity146 in 2013 , not just for its global takings of $ 286 million , but for being an original screenplay - a follow - up to @entity150 's sleeper hit @entity152 - and not an adaptation			1
