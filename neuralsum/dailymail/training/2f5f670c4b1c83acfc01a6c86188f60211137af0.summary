by @entity0 published : 01:02 est , 16 november 2012 updated : 06:27 est , 16 november 2012 in @entity2 we like to think our native spiders are n’t capable of delivering a bite that could kill us			0
but @entity5 , 31 , feared she would either die or lose an arm after being bitten by one of the creatures in her house as she slept			1
the arm swelled up so much that the blood flow was blocked and the limb became infected			1
@entity5 nearly had her arm amputated when she developed compartment syndrome after being bitten by a spider whilst asleep at her @entity17 home as the flesh on it began to die , doctors warned they may have to amputate to save her life			1
‘ i was in that much pain when they told me i needed my arm amputated i did n’t even care , ’ said mrs @entity5 , a civil servant			1
‘ it was agony and i know i have been very lucky to survive and keep my arm			2
i ca n’t believe all this happened over a bite from a house spider			0
' you ’d expect it in @entity32 , but not here			0
’ mrs @entity5 , from @entity33 in @entity34 , @entity35 , woke up to find a red bite on her left wrist in february			1
over the following two days , her arm began to swell and throb and her local @entity39 clinic prescribed antibiotics			2
but over the next few days her condition deteriorated and her husband @entity42 , 35 , had to dial 999 when she began vomiting and could n’t stand up			1
she was taken to @entity44 in @entity45 , where she was diagnosed with compartment syndrome – a condition in which tissue such as muscle dies off because the blood vessels supplying it have been squeezed shut by pressure on them			2
she was treated with antibiotics to control the deadly infection causing the swelling , but was warned she would most likely lose her arm			1
following physiotherapy after being bitten , mrs @entity5 has now regained the some movement and has returned to work she added : ‘ @entity62 now it looked like a balloon			1
i honestly thought i was going to die			0
’ in a three - hour operation surgeons managed to strip away most of the infected tissue			2
they stopped short of amputating the limb but warned mrs @entity5 she might still lose it			1
for the next three days she was taken back to theatre daily for more infected tissue to be removed			0
a week later it was infection - free and surgeons rebuilt @entity5 ’s arm using tissue from her thigh			1
following physiotherapy , she has regained some movement and has now been able to return to work			0
she said : ‘ my arm and leg are both badly scarred but i ’m lucky to be alive			2
now i always check the bed for spiders and insects			0
at first i was worried it must have been a foreign spider , but the doctors assured me it was n’t			0
‘ whatever bit me was the usual kind of creepy crawly that lives in houses across @entity2			0
' in this country we do n’t worry about such bites but i want to warn other people to be aware of what can happen			0

@entity5 suffered *horrendous* swelling to arm
it blocked the blood flow and turned her limb septic
her husband called 999 after she vomited *green* *pus*
life - *threatening* issues but arm was eventually saved
