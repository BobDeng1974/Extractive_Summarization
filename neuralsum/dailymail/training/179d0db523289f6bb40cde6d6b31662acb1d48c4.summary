by @entity0 published : 13:58 est , 9 december 2013 @entity2 : 12:04 est , 10 december 2013 most daughters idolise their mothers , so when @entity7 's four - year - old told her she wanted a ' big tummy ' like hers she knew she had to do something drastic about her 18 - stone frame			1
in the days that followed , she went on a strict liquid diet and documented her weight loss by taking daily photos of herself in the same outfit in front of her bedroom mirror			1
every day , she 'd monitor her progress by flicking through the photos on her smart phone and seeing the visible changes to her waistline			2
incredibly , in the first week , she lost 10 pounds and says the difference in her physical appearance in the ' day one ' picture to the ' day seven ' photo was huge			1
naturally , the fantastic results spurred @entity7 to continue with her diet , and six months later the mother - of - three had shed an incredible six stone - taking her from a size 26 to a svelte 12			1
@entity7 , left , at her goal weight of 11 stone , and at her heaviest of 18 stone , right speaking to @entity38 she said : ' taking pictures of myself really helped me track my weight loss			1
sometimes it 's hard to see the difference when you 're looking in the mirror every day and it can be disheartening for slimmers if they ca n't tell their hard work is paying off			2
' like most people on diets , at times you can get depressed and there 's a temptation to pig out if you 're not seeing the effects of your hard work quick enough			2
but my timeline of pics on my phone helped me to stay focussed and on the straight and narrow			0
' i was devastated when my beautiful daughter told me she wanted to be fat like me and i did n't want her grow up thinking obesity was normal			0
' overweight people need to know the effect their lifestyle is having on their children			2
it was a real eye - opener for me			2
' growing up , @entity7 says she was always curvy and bigger than her peers			1
but it was n't until the birth of her third child , @entity72 , now 17 months , that she started to pile on the pounds			1
' throughout my early 20s my weight fluctuated between a size 14 - 16 , ' said @entity7 , a full time mum who lives with her husband @entity76 , 24 , a photographer , and their three children @entity77 , five , @entity80 , four and @entity72 , 17 months , in @entity81 , @entity82			1
' but leading up to my wedding in july 2011 i was really strict on myself and determined to fit into a size 12 - 14 dress			1
' the problem was that after the wedding i resumed my bad eating habits and regained all the weight i 'd lost			1
but it was n't until @entity91 arrived in august 2012 that i really piled on the pounds			0
' @entity7 at 16 , left , and 17 stone , right shockingly , around this time @entity7 admits she was packing away 4,000 calories a day - double the recommended amount for women			1
she says : ' @entity76 's 6ft and eats like a horse			1
stupidly , i thought i could graze all day like him and i 'd be fine , but at 5ft 7ins i could n't get away with it			2
' on a daily basis i was gorging on @entity101 's three times a week , greasy takeaway and sugary snacks and cakes			1
what 's more , i was eating late at night , mainly out of boredom , in front of the tv			2
it was n't healthy and i felt miserable most of the time			0
not only was i harming myself - but giving my kids a bad role model because they thought the way i looked was normal			2
' simple things like picking the kids up required a major effort because my gigantic belly would get in the way			0
i was so unhealthy that i 'd huff and puff over the smallest task			0
' but the wake - up call @entity7 desperately needed came in april 2013			1
' one afternoon @entity122 came home in floods of tears , ' continues @entity7 , ' i sat her down and asked her what was wrong			1
she told me a mum at the school gates had commented on how skinny she was			0
' confused , i asked her why that had upset her and she replied , ' because i want a big tummy like you '			0
i burst into tears and hugged her			0
i was riddled with guilt and in that moment i realised i had to do something drastic about my weight once and for all			2
' i was her idol and i 'd let her down			0
by being overweight i 'd unwittingly presented this distorted view of the world and made her think being fat was normal			0
' @entity7 at 16 stone , left , and 15 stone , right that night @entity7 told @entity76 she was going on a strict diet and he said he 'd support her totally			1
she says : ' i started looking at diet plans and decided the @entity144 was the best one for me			2
i 'd used it when i lost weight for my wedding and i knew i needed something really strict to kick - start my weight loss			1
' on other diets , i 'd cheat or make excuses - but you ca n't really cheat on this one because the ' meals ' are set out and you have weekly weigh - ins with your consultant			2
' the regime is strict - @entity7 had to swap her fat , starchy meals for three liquid shakes a day at the expense of Â £ 40 a week			1
at first she felt miserable and constantly tired , but she hated being 18 stone 12 more than any other feelings			1
' it was really tough , ' she admits			0
' i 'm a foodie and i used to love sitting down with @entity76 and the kids and tucking into a hearty meal			1
but taking daily photos of my weight loss spurred me on and stopped me from relapsing			1
' i deliberately bought new leggings and a tight top so i could monitor the weight loss properly			2
i only wore the clothes when i was weighing myself in front of the mirror and taking a pic. i did n't want to stretch them as it might not give a true representation of what i 'd lost			0
' soon , @entity122 wanted to know what drinks i was having as meal replacements			0
so i explained that mummy had eaten too many bad foods like sweets and chocolate and had become fat as a result			0
' incredibly , @entity7 shed 10lbs in one week - taking her down to just under 18 stone			1
on top of her diet plan , @entity7 did 100 stomach sit - ups a day and pilates three times a week to strengthen her muscles			1
@entity7 at 14 stone 12 , left , and at 13 stone 10 , right ' it was amazing , ' she recalls , ' the diet was hard core and sometimes i 'd burst into tears when i put the kids ' dinner on the table because i was so hungry and craving solid food			1
but then i would take my phone out of my pocket and have a quick flick through the pics to remind myself why i was doing this			0
it was just the incentive i needed to help me through the bad times			0
' as the months rolled by , the weight continued to drop off			2
by october , six months into the diet plan , she weighed 12 stone and was a size 12			1
she says : ' i could n't believe it			0
i looked like a new woman ! friends who had n't seen me for a while did n't recognise me when they saw me			0
they 'd do a double - take and ask if it was me			0
' and it was n't just my diet i 'd radically changed , it was my life - style too			0
before , when i met up with friends i 'd scoff cakes and guzzle hot chocolate laced with cream - now i 'd order a herbal tea instead			0
last month , @entity7 started introducing solids back into her diet			1
she now has a shake for breakfast , a chicken salad for lunch and a low carb dinner in the evening , such as steamed fish with vegetables			0
@entity7 at 13 stone , left , and finally her 12 stone target , right ' although i 'm happy with my weight loss i 'm determined not to drift back into my bad old ways			1
i want to reach my target weight of 10 stone and be a size ten			1
i still take photos every day and i 'm shocked when i look through the old ones and see how big i was			0
it 's terrifying to think i was carrying so much weight around with me and putting my health at risk			0
' i have so much more energy nowadays and l enjoy running around with the kids now			0
@entity76 loves my new shape and is looking forward to treating me to a new wardrobe this @entity257			2
although i was devastated by my daughter 's comment at the time , looking back it was the best thing that ever happened to me			0
it gave me the wake - up call i so desperately needed			0
