childrenswear retailer @entity0 ' @entity2 is refusing to remove a range of @entity5 clothing from its stores - despite an intensive campaign from a group of mothers who insist the designs are too ' sexualized ' for their children			1
@entity13 - based mother @entity12 started an online petition earlier this week asking the retailer to remove the ' damaging ' garments after seeing the new collection , which is designed for baby girls aged zero to 24 months , on shelves and online			1
but despite the overwhelming amount of support that the petition has received - it currently has more than 2,500 signatures - the retailer revealed to @entity27 that it will not be removing any of the offending clothing from any of its stores			1
leading the charge : @entity13 mother @entity12 started the campaign to remove the inappropriate designs fashion faux pas : many parents are outraged by the ' sexualized ' nature of the designs appropriate ? the @entity5 collection includes this $ 23 pleather mini skirt a spokesperson for @entity2 said : ' we have no plans to stop selling this collection			1
' the news will no doubt come as a blow to @entity12 and her supporters , many of whom have promised to boycott the retailer until they agree to take action			1
the campaign comes just one week after @entity2 ' sister store @entity51 agreed to stop selling a line of breaking bad action figures , after parents accused the retailer of promoting drug use through the sale of the toys			1
' i do n't want my child to grow up to be a @entity62 star , ' @entity12 wrote at the top of her petition , which is posted on @entity65			2
' you pulled the @entity68 toys because they promoted drug use			0
you should pull this clothing line because it promotes bad behavior as well			0
' the madness has to stop			2
if the toys are damaging so is the clothing			0
' the collection , which is an extension of @entity76 , @entity77 and @entity79 's globally - successful @entity78 for adults , includes a $ 25 leatherette mini skirt - with ' attached diaper cover ' - a $ 33 fur faux animal print vest and a $ 23 leatherette skirt			1
motherly instincts : both @entity76 , 34 , and @entity79 , 35 , have young daughters of their own ' damaging ' : the designs , such as this pair of gold lurex pants , have been deemed completely inappropriate for young children ' disgusting ' : the collection includes a number of short skirts and tight - fitting lurex trousers each of the designs , while not necessarily the personal handiwork of @entity76 , 34 , @entity77 , 30 and @entity79 , 35 , have all been given the seal of approval by the sisters which is perhaps all the more disturbing given that @entity76 and @entity79 both have young daughters of their own			1
@entity79 welcomed her daughter @entity104 , her second child with long - term partner @entity105 , in july 2012 , while @entity76 and @entity107 's daughter @entity108 was born on june 15 last year			0
at the time of writing , the petition , which is just a few days old , has already been signed more than 2,000 times by eager supporters , many of whom wholeheartedly agree with @entity12 's thoughts about the offending clothing designs			2
@entity5 controversy : while @entity77 , @entity76 and @entity79 did not design each of the garments themselves , each item of clothing has been given their seal of approval car crash clothing : while the @entity128 ' clothing collections have proved incredibly popular with adults , they seem to have missed the mark with their unsuitable childrenswear designs ' i would never spend my money on it ' : the petition has now been signed by more than 2,000 people , many of whom have children and grandchildren of their own @entity140 from @entity141 , @entity142 , wrote : ' babies do n't need to look like porn stars ' while @entity146 from @entity147 , @entity145 added : ' @entity68 toys are nowhere near as damaging to a young psyche as sexualization at such a young age			2
' these people should be ashamed			0
' the campaign has also convinced some people to boycott the store entirely , with one mother commenting on the petition : ' disgusting			2
i was just looking at starting my baby registry at @entity51 last night			0
i am so glad i saw this first			0
' babies are innocent ' : one mother claimed that she will not shop at @entity51 until the offending garments are removed @entity164 garments : these gold lurex trousers retail for $ 33 stop the madness : @entity13 - based mother @entity12 is demanding that the @entity168 's ' damaging ' baby clothes be removed from all @entity2 stores 's * * * * s and babies just do not go together			1
babies are innocent , @entity76 is a s * * * k , any questions ? ' and it 's not just parents who have taken offence at the inappropriate clothing collection			0
@entity179 , a grandmother from @entity180 , @entity181 , said of the designs : ' i am a grandmother and shop at @entity51			0
' i find the @entity185 completely inappropriate and would never spend my money on any @entity5 merchandise that promotes their stardom from a sex tape			0

the collection includes a $ 25 leatherette mini skirt and $ 33 gold lurex pants
a spokesperson for the store told @entity27 : ' we have no plans to stop selling this collection '
