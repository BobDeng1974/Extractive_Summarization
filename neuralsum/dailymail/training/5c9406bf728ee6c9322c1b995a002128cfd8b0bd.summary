@entity1 commuters who faced an inconvenient trudge through freezing snowfall this morning might be surprised to learn that they do n't have their city 's mayor to blame			2
@entity6 did a quick sidestep of responsibility for the complete shutdown of subways , buses , trains and ferries today and instead pointed the finger at @entity1 governor @entity15 for the decision			1
during a press conference on tuesday , mayor @entity6 said : ' we found out just as it was being announced			2
we did not get a lot of advance notice			0
' @entity1 mayor @entity6 ( left ) said he knew little about the subway shutdown ahead of governor @entity15 ( right ) making an announcement on monday related to the storm the @entity27 's network - which includes all subway and bus lines , @entity30 and @entity31 , along with the @entity32 - was completely shut down from 11pm on monday until 9am tuesday as the city braced for up to 2 feet of snow and hurricane - strength winds			1
@entity36 came in for serious flak on tuesday when @entity1 awoke to several inches of snow - a light dusting compared to what it usually receives each winter and nowhere near the ' historic ' event that the mayor had threatened			1
however he was defiant and unapologetic this morning for the extreme precautions - including closing all roads to non-emergency vehicles - saying that forecasts across the board had predicted 2 feet of snow and that @entity1 had ' dodged a bullet '			1
the mayor said : ' we did what was necessary to keep everyone safe ... this is a better safe than sorry scenario			0
' back to business : commuters board the first 7 train to arrive at @entity60 station in @entity61 on tuesday morning shortly after a nine - hour shutdown was lifted			2
there were grumbles from @entity1 that shutting down the entire transit network was not necessary the highest snowfall recorded in the @entity1 area about around 12 inches at @entity68 while eastern @entity61 received close to ten inches			1
@entity69 saw about six inches of snow			2
@entity36 told a tuesday press conference that he was right to be cautious after the city did n't react quick enough to a massive storm in 2010			0
governor @entity15 echoed de @entity6 's sentiments that the city had taken the appropriate action when faced with a brutal forecast for winter storm @entity79			1
@entity15 added : ' the plows have been working , salt trucks have been working , but it is not to be taken lightly			0
' we 're not saying that you should go out unless you really need to go out			0
' @entity15 said many areas had received two feet of snow - particularly in @entity88 - and that @entity89 had been battered but @entity1 experienced less damage			1
city schools which were closed on tuesday were due to reopen on wednesday			0
the @entity27 reported that it will run a sunday service today ( about 40 per cent less than usual ) and be back to full service on wednesday			0
city workers salt and scrape the subway steps at @entity96 in downtown @entity97 as @entity27 announced that a reduced service was back on track on tuesday			0

@entity6 said he only heard that the transit network would be shut immediately before governor @entity15 's announcement on monday
subways , buses , trains and ferries were *suspended* in @entity1 from 11pm monday until 9am tuesday
forecasts had been for 2 feet of snow - in fact , snowfall in @entity1 was only a couple of inches
