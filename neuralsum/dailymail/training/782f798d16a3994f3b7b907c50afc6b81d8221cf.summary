by @entity0 a stunned couple whose first child was born though a pioneering @entity4 technique are expecting their second baby after conceiving naturally			1
@entity7 and @entity8 tried in vain to start a family for four years before becoming the first parents in the @entity12 to have a child using a new @entity4 procedure			1
but two years after the arrival of daughter @entity17 , the couple were shocked to discover mrs @entity18 was pregnant again - after a natural conception			1
the new addition to the @entity18 family is due on @entity22			2
mrs @entity18 said : ' i could n't believe it when it read positive			1
i screamed " two pink lines " at @entity8 , and then i did n't speak for about 20 minutes out of shock			2
' mrs @entity18 , pictured with her daughter @entity17 at three months pregnant left , and when @entity17 was a newborn , right , is due to give birth to her second child on @entity22 mrs @entity18 , 29 , said : ' we both really wanted children and it was the natural thing for us after getting married and buying a house together ' it was really hard when we found out we could n’t have children			1
all i heard the doctor say was " impossible " and i zoned out from the reasons why			0
fertility expert dr @entity49 said in her career which has spanned 20 years , she has heard of couple 's concieving naturally following ivf			1
she said there are two different circumstances when it can happen			0
the first is in instances with couples like the @entity58 , who have conceived through @entity4 and go on to have a second baby naturally			1
and the second is when couples ' ivf fails , yet they fall pregnant naturally later			1
dr @entity62 , of @entity63 , said : ' i do n't know the specific explanation for his , but i have a feeling that because of the hormonal changes in the body during pregnancy , somehow it makes the ovaries , eggs and function of the reproductive system better , leaving couples able to concieve naturally			1
' it is as though the ovaries are stimulated as a result of the pregnancy			2
' i have seen a few cases in each instance , where a couple already has a child through @entity4 , as well as the more rare occurrence , when a couple 's @entity4 has failed			1
' ' i ’d peed on so many sticks and every month i ’d get hopeful			0
i ’d think of dresses and pick out dresses in my head , but every time the result was the same			0
' the couple , from @entity89 in @entity90 , decided to try and conceive using in vitro fertilisation ( @entity4 ) - a process where an egg is fertilised by sperm outside the body			2
but they were chosen for an @entity98 trial into a new form of @entity4 using an incubator with in - built microscopes , meaning a fertilised embryo would remain undisturbed during the crucial conception			2
mrs @entity18 underwent the pioneering procedure at @entity105 in @entity106			1
previously , an embryo would have been removed from the incubator several times for doctors to examine it under a microscope , creating risks that may have caused the @entity4 to be unsuccessful			2
but the new technique uses a time - lapse system that allows embryologists to see how the embryo develops so the best one is used to bring on conception			0
the couple were given the time - lapse video to watch the six - day artificial conception unfold in just a matter of seconds			0
' it was awesome to look at and a really special way of marking the pregnancy , ' said mrs @entity18 , who owns her own cake business			1
' people can usually see their baby develop through scan pictures but not from as early on as this			0
' it ’s amazing to watch it and think how did that turn into my little girl who ’s now running around like a maniac			0
' but two years after the birth of her first child @entity17 , mrs @entity18 was baffled to learn she was pregnant for the second time after conceiving naturally			1
the couple 's daughter @entity17 , pictured left and right , was born after mrs @entity18 was given a radical new form of @entity4 , having been told by doctors it was ' impossible ' for her to conceive naturally she said : ' everything started tasting of mushrooms , which is what happened when i fell pregnant with @entity17			1
' i did n’t believe for one minute that i might be pregnant but i was late as well so i bought a test			0
' i could n’t believe it when it read positive			0
i screamed ‘ two pink lines ’ at @entity8 , and then i did n’t speak for about 20 minutes out of shock			0
' the family are hoping to raise awareness of the pioneering treatment for other couples who are struggling to get pregnant			0
mr @entity8 , 35 , an expert software engineer , said : ' it was so surreal for us			2
' our aim is to raise awareness and help some other families in the future			0
' we see it as a way of paying back for what we received from the @entity4 treatment			0

@entity7 and @entity8 spent four years trying for a baby to no avail
became first parents in the @entity12 to have a child using a new @entity4 procedure
their daughter @entity17 was born two years *ago*
mrs @entity18 was shocked to discover she had fallen pregnant again
they conceived naturally and are expecting their second child in december
fertility expert said it is rare but couple 's who have been through @entity4 can fall pregnant naturally afterwards
dr @entity49 said it could be down to pregnancy stimulating the ovaries
