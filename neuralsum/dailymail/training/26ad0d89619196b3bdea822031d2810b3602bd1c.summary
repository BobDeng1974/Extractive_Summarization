by @entity0 published : 05:13 est , 11 june 2013 updated : 07:42 est , 11 june 2013 enough shale gas to keep @entity3 self - sufficient for a decade is sitting untouched under the @entity3 , experts said today			1
a buoyant report from @entity7 's @entity6 ( @entity6 ) says the @entity3 's ' technically recoverable ' shale gas reserves are at 26 trillion cubic feet ( tcf ) - which is almost ten times what @entity3 consumes a year			1
extraction has already started in the @entity11 , and the @entity3 is thought to have significant shale gas resources in @entity13 , the @entity14 , @entity15 and the @entity17 border			1
but @entity6 's scientists also said today fracking has ' got off to an abysmal start ' in @entity3 after it triggered ' two earthquakes ' near @entity22 , with ' political opposition ' highlighted as the main threat to it happening			1
untapped : a test drilling site for shale gas on the outskirts of @entity28 , @entity29 , one of the areas of @entity3 which could hold enough to keep the @entity3 self - sufficient for a decade their study also said that for the first time shale oil could also be extracted , with an estimated 700million barrels - worth waiting to be tapped			1
the new figures are a shot in the arm for the industry , as estimates on obtainable volumes of fossil fuels continue to rise			0
in a 2011 study , the @entity6 said technically recoverable shale gas resources were 20 tcf , while a year earlier the @entity44 ( @entity45 ) said it was more likely a quarter of that total - 5.3 tcf			1
fracking involves firing water and chemicals into rocks to ' hydraulically fracture ' them , which then releases gas or oil			0
@entity53 : more than ten times as much gas lies under the @entity11 than previously believed - and it could make the @entity3 self - sufficient for at least 10 years			1
the red areas highlight where shale gas is thought to be present process : the controversial technique of fracking uses a high - pressured mix of water and chemicals to force out reserves from deep layers of rock operations close to @entity22 were halted in 2011 and led to an 18 - month moratoriumamid concerns about the process after two small tremors struck in the area			1
problems : a test drilling site for shale gas at @entity74 near @entity22			2
the area was hit by two earthquakes previously in what experts have called an ' abysmal start to fracking in the @entity3 the company working in @entity29 , @entity80 says there could 200 tcf where they are working			1
only a proportion of the total volume will be accessible to the shale gas industry but even if just 10 per cent of the @entity11 ’s reserves can be brought to the surface it could end the entire @entity3 ’s dependency on foreign imports for a decade			1
but opponents of fracking claim that it is unsafe			0
they argue that drilling could scar the @entity3 countryside and clog roads with hundreds of lorries transporting gas and dirty water			2
there are also concerns that the chemical composition of the fracking fluid - which is believed to contain upwards of a hundred different chemicals - could pollute water supplies			0
the @entity6 has admitted that fracking , which is much more widespread in @entity7 , is a more complicated process in the @entity3			2
' compared with @entity7 , the shale geology of the @entity3 is considerably more complex , while drilling and completion costs for shale wells are substantially higher , ' their report said			2
' while the @entity3 ’s shale resource base appears substantial , commercial levels of shale production are yet to be established			2
' the report went on : ' political opposition to shale development is greater in the @entity3 than in @entity118 ' , which is @entity120 's leader , adding : ' hydraulic fracturing got off to an abysmal start ( in @entity3 )			1
the @entity3 ’s first shale production test well triggered small local earthquakes '			2
the word ' fracking ' comes from the term ' hydraulic fracturing '			0
water , sand and cocktails of chemicals are piped into shale rock formations deep underground			0
@entity133 is a fine - grained sedimentary rock made up of mud that is a mixture of clay minerals and tiny fragments particles of other minerals , such as quartz and calcite			0
the high pressure injection causes the rock to fracture , creating fissures along which previously trapped gas can flow and be extracted			0
the sand and the chemicals help keep the fractures open and lubricated			0
the first experimental use of hydraulic fracturing was in 1947 and the first commercially successful uses were in 1949			0
in 2010 , it was estimated that 60 per cent of all new oil and gas wells worldwide were being hydraulically fractured			0
as of 2012 , 2.5 million hydraulic fracturing jobs have been performed on oil and gas wells worldwide .			0

@entity161 @entity6 ups estimate of @entity3 's recoverable fuel
finds there are 26 trillion cubic feet of shale gas - ten times @entity3 's annual use
but experts admit fracking in @entity3 has ' got off to an abysmal start '
