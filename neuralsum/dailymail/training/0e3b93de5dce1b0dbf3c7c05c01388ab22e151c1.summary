by @entity0 published : 12:13 est , 2 november 2012 updated : 12:23 est , 2 november 2012 rumour after rumour was swirling and stoking the hopes and frustrations of the crowd - there would be gas in two hours , in five hours , in six hours			2
but once it gets here the question is how long will it last ? last night people were fighting over the dwindling fuel left , but by this morning that desperation had turned into simply finding it - or even the promise of it			2
at @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 that ripple of a rumour that a truck was on its way was all that it took			1
and after two hours of driving past closed gas stations patrolled by police waving angry drivers by it is easy to understand why			1
patience : people wait in line for fuel at a @entity31 station in @entity32 , @entity33 by 7.30am the cars were lined up around two blocks			1
by 10.30am there were more than 100 , engines stilled , drivers out , waiting			2
on the forecourt 50 people were huddled holding their gas cans , water bottles , as many containers they could carry or load onto a trolley			2
they want fuel and they want answers			2
for @entity50 a worker for @entity49 it was the second day of searching and waiting - and she was not alone : ' i drove all down @entity52 yesterday and every gas station was closed			0
i 've got two kids , a four - year - old and a seven year old			0
we 've got no power , @entity57 is doing nothing , telling us nothing			0
' out of gas : a police officer moves a car that is out of gas , trying to position it so it can fill up , at a gas station in @entity66 today heated : tempers flared at the @entity69 station at @entity70 and @entity71 , as customers suspected the gas station attendant was pumping gas for a man that cut in line desperate : last night people were fighting over the dwindling fuel left , but by this morning that desperation had turned into simply finding it - or even the promise of it her anger was echoed by others standing by			1
' it 's all about @entity88 , ' said one			0
' the mayor 's doing a horrible job , ' came another and within moments the anger that lies so close to the surface right now bubbled up			1
people tweeted asking for information on open gas stations , others tweeted when they found them or moment by moment as they closed			1
a @entity104 site was set up to track what was open , what was closed , when gas was perhaps being delivered , how long the queue to get it			0
@entity110 , 72 , had seen something like it before , in the seventies he said when there was , as he put it , ' a real gas shortage			0
' ' people are angry because the gas is there they just ca n't get it			1
do you know how to get it ? can you use your influence to get some ? wait in line : queues of people and of cars snake around the block waiting for fuel in this gas station in @entity131 , @entity33 call for order : a @entity20 police officer speaks to a customer at a @entity136 fuelling station in @entity66 , @entity137 as the fuel crisis grips the @entity20 area ' there were five trucks came in here from a @entity144 charity and they got straight through and filled up			1
some people can get it			0
' this is how it starts - the rumours of special treatment , apocryphal or true no - one in this queue really knows but they feed the resentment and frustration offering someone or some group to blame			0
however united these people may be in a common need the reality is that if that need ca n't be met for all , camaraderie will swiftly give way to something altogether more ugly			1
the police know it , that 's why they are here and the crowd know it - they can feel it			0
' people are getting killed for gas , ' shouted one guy .			0

tempers begin to flair in queues at gas stations across @entity20 and @entity33 as *worried* drivers fear it will run out
drivers *complain* that @entity20 mayor @entity182 is ' doing a horrible job '
anger over some drivers using ' *privilege* ' to jump queues
one *motorist* : ' the fuel is there , we just ca n't get it '
