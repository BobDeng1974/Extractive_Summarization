@entity1 ' teenage striker @entity0 marked his first ever @entity2 start with a brace as @entity5 's side clinched a 3 - 1 win over @entity7			1
the 18 - year - old had made just four substitute appearances before facing the sons at the @entity11 , but his double put @entity1 in command after they fell behind to @entity14 's second - minute opener			1
the former @entity17 full - back 's last goal was also against @entity1 - he netted the @entity19 ' winner in a controversial @entity21 quarter - final replay at @entity22 in march 2011			1
@entity1 ' teenage striker @entity0 scored a brace on his full debut against @entity7 on saturday @entity0 's brace comes as @entity1 boss @entity5 fulfills his promise of fielding more academy players a touchline bust - up between then @entity17 boss @entity29 and @entity31 assistant @entity30 sparked a summit on sectarianism but there was no further drama this time as @entity36 fired home a spectacular third and @entity1 eased to victory			1
@entity5 promised his students from the @entity41 youth ranks they would be given their chance to impress when he took over last month			0
and he stayed good to his word as @entity0 - who has notched more than 30 times for the club 's under - 20s side - and winger @entity45 came in to replace @entity48 and @entity49 following wednesday 's 1 - 1 slip - up at @entity51			2
but @entity53 's horror miss after less than a minute was not the start the @entity55 boss was looking for , especially when @entity14 showed the @entity31 striker how it should have been done 60 seconds later			1
@entity58 should have cleared @entity60 's cross but got caught underneath the ball and could only head it straight to the @entity64 defender			0
the 30 - year - old averages just a goal a season but showed no hesitancy as he flashed a left - footed strike past @entity70 to give the sons a shock lead			0
@entity73 thought he had the visitors level , only for home keeper @entity75 to produce a stunning reaction stop to keep out the skipper 's volley			2
but @entity0 did find the net after 10 minutes as he capped his full debut with a dream goal			1
sons defender @entity82 could not live with the teenager 's pace as he latched on to @entity36 's through ball and raced in on goal			1
@entity75 got a hand to the youngster 's low shot but @entity0 stayed alert and followed in to force the ball over the line before @entity93 could block			2
@entity75 did better with @entity58 's powerful strike , but @entity1 suffered another scare when @entity96 danced past @entity73 before lashing just wide of @entity70 's goal			2
@entity45 and @entity98 fired over as @entity5 's team looked for the lead , but there was no breakthrough by the interval			2
but they only had to wait three minutes into the second period for @entity0 to strike again			0
rangers playmarker @entity36 ( right ) has become a fan - favourite during his loan spell from @entity109 @entity58 took a high ball and hooked it wide to @entity111 , whose cross flew towards the youngster at an awkward height			0
but , with his back to goal , he sent the ball over his own shoulder with a flick of his toe and watched it bounce past @entity75 ' dive into the bottom corner			0
now in front , @entity1 went for @entity7 's throat and got their reward as @entity36 collected @entity98 's short pass before whipping an unstoppable 25 - yard shot into the top - left corner			1
the sons , though , came up with a couple of reminders that they should not be discounted yet as @entity133 fired just over before on - loan @entity17 defender @entity93 leapt unmarked to head straight at @entity70			0
@entity0 , though , was looking to make his impressive start even more special and nearly grabbed himself a hat - trick as his attempted lob sailed just over @entity75 ' crossbar			0
but he was denied his treble when @entity5 afforded the frontman a standing ovation as he was replaced by @entity142 with five minutes left			0
@entity1 were not satisfied yet , though , and nearly had a fourth when @entity98 shook the bar from the edge of the box , while @entity53 was not far away with an ambitious 40 - yard volley			0
