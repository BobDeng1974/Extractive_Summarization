researchers have discovered the largest fresh meteor - impact crater ever spotted on @entity2			1
the before - and - after images were captured by @entity5 's @entity4			1
the huge crater spans half the length of a football field and first appeared in march 2012			1
the left image was taken during @entity2 afternoon on march 27 , 2012 ; the right one on the afternoon of march 28 , 2012			1
the largest crater associated with a march 2012 impact on @entity2 has many smaller craters around it , revealed in this image from the @entity23 ( @entity23 ) camera on @entity5 's @entity4			1
the largest crater is slightly elongated and spans 159 by 143 feet ( 48.5 by 43.5 meters )			2
experts estimate the impact object measured about 10 to 18 feet ( 3 to 5 meters ) long , which is less than a third the estimated length of the asteroid that hit @entity30 's atmosphere near @entity31			2
because @entity2 has much less atmosphere than @entity30 , space rocks of comparable size are more likely to penetrate to the surface of @entity2 and cause larger craters			0
the impact that created it likely was preceded by an explosion in the @entity2 sky caused by intense friction between an incoming asteroid and the planet 's atmosphere			1
' this series of events can be likened to the meteor blast that shattered windows in @entity31 , @entity50 , last year , ' the researchers say			0
' the air burst and ground impact darkened an area of the @entity2 surface about 5 miles ( 8 kilometers ) across			2
' the darkened spot appears in images taken by the orbiter 's weather - monitoring camera , the @entity12 ( @entity4 )			2
since the orbiter began its systematic observation of @entity2 in 2006 , scientist @entity59 has examined @entity4 's daily global coverage , looking for evidence of dust storms and other observable weather events in the images			1
about two months ago , @entity59 noticed an inconspicuous dark dot near the equator in one of the images			0
' it was n't what i was looking for , ' @entity59 said			0
' i was doing my usual weather monitoring and something caught my eye			0
these images from the @entity78 ( @entity4 ) on @entity5 's @entity4 were taken before ( left ) and after ( right ) an apparent impact scar appeared in the area in march 2012 and was detected in images from the orbiter 's @entity12 ( @entity4 )			1
comparing the jan. 16 , 2012 , image on the left with the april 6 , 2014 , image on the right confirms that two adjacent fresh craters appeared during that interval			0
' it looked usual , with rays emanating from a central spot			0
' he began examining earlier images , skipping back a month or more at a time			0
the images revealed that the dark spot was present a year ago , but not five years ago			0
he homed in further , checking images from about 40 different dates , and pinned down the date the impact event occurred ; the spot was not there up through march 27 , 2012 , and then appeared before the daily imaging on march 28 , 2012			1
once the dark spot was verified as new , it was targeted last month by @entity4 and the orbiter 's sharpest - sighted camera , the @entity23 ( @entity23 )			2
this april 6 , 2014 , image from the @entity23 ( @entity23 ) camera on @entity5 's @entity4 shows numerous landslides in the vicinity of where an impact crater was excavated in march 2012			1
of the approximately 400 fresh crater - causing impacts on @entity2 that have been documented with before - and - after images , this is the only one discovered using a @entity4 image , rather than an image from a higher - resolution camera			1
' the biggest crater is unusual , quite shallow compared to other fresh craters we have observed , ' said @entity23 principal investigator @entity122 of the @entity123 , @entity124			0
the largest crater is slightly elongated and spans 159 by 143 feet ( 48.5 by 43.5 meters )			0
@entity122 estimates the impact object measured about 10 to 18 feet ( 3 to 5 meters ) long , which is less than a third the estimated length of the asteroid that hit @entity30 's atmosphere near @entity31			2
