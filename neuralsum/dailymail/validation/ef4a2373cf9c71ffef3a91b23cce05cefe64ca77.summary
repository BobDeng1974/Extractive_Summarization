in a recently unearthed letter to his mistress @entity14 , the 25 - year - old @entity2 makes it clear – using somewhat colourful language – that he would rather spend time with her than on official duties			1
@entity2 , who was known as @entity24 , @entity22 at the time , also moaned about a ' f * * * * * * world trip ' he was about to embark upon in his royal capacity			1
their liaison began in 1918 after a chance meeting at a party in an air raid in @entity38 and lasted five years			2
then 23 , the socialite was a married to @entity40 mp @entity40 , who apparently turned a blind eye to the affair			2

i feel so lost sweetie			0
i ’ve been thinking of you so much sweetheart since we parted and am so happy i took you to the station			0
' @entity66 , darling i ca n’t even start to try to thank you and bless you for all your divine marvellous sweetness			0
' i can never tell you how madly and desperately i love you darling and you know it and how yuou mean absolutely all and everything to me in life ; nothing else seems to matter now , not even my bloody job of which i am so so sick ! ! ' their affair was well - known to aristocrats and politicians			1
in 1927 , @entity81 travelled on a train with the couple , and noted : ' it was quite pathetic to see the prince with @entity14			2
his love is so obvious and undisguisable			0
' @entity14 and @entity22 with @entity87 and @entity88 of @entity89 in 1932 the prince sent her thousands of letters and the pair stayed in contact until he met mrs @entity23			2

@entity99 , from @entity101 ’s @entity100 , said : ' the love letter reveals a rare glimpse of the innermost private lives of the @entity106 monarchy , and furthermore of an ordinary man completely besotted with his lover			0
' the letter portrays the scene of a man , forced to leave his lover over work commitments			0
' writing only hours after their parting , he passionately describes his hatred for leaving her on the train platform that morning , and his longing for her reply			0
' the prince describes his royal duties as tedious chores , tearing him away from his love and one person in the world he feels at home with			0

the two princes drove at over 60mph on ‘ greasy ’ country roads to reach the rural estate , bursting a tyre along the way			0
@entity2 headed the letter ‘ @entity149 , @entity4 ’ and , clearly wanting to be elsewhere , wrote underneath the address ‘ f * * * it ! ! ! ’ writing about the perilous car journey he said : ' @entity48 and i arrived safely at 6.00			1
' we took 4 hrs to come via @entity154 as the roads were greasy and we tore an outer cover which meant changing the wheel ; but the car ran fine and we overran 60mph twice tho how i wanted you to be sitting beside me instead of @entity48			0
