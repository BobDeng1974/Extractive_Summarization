by @entity0 published : 09:05 est , 5 march 2014 updated : 12:51 est , 5 march 2014 health and social services staff have been criticised in a report into the ' preventable ' death of a five - month - old baby who died from acute rickets			1
the parents of @entity9 were jailed for manslaughter by gross negligence last week after they failed to obtain medical help for their sick child			1
@entity15 , 36 , and @entity16 , 32 , who are members of the @entity18 , prayed for their child 's recovery rather than seek medical help , the @entity14 heard			1
@entity22 ( right ) and his wife @entity24 ( left ) were jailed for manslaughter by gross negligence last week at the @entity14			1
the couple prayed for their child 's recovery rather than seek medical help , the court heard the couple refused medical treatment for their son on religious grounds until he died from a severe vitamin d deficiency			1
a @entity36 has now found a catalogue of failures and says : ' a number of opportunities to protect the baby were missed			1
' the report , published today , says there was a ' consistent lack or professional curiosity ' into the family , from @entity47 , @entity48			1
the report , which calls the infant ' @entity51 ' , says the attitude of health visitors was ' extremely optimistic ' and there was a lack of monitoring by agencies and a failure of communication between them			1
the family doctor failed to promote vitamin d and staff were confused over forms			2
the report , from @entity66 , said : ' this was a preventable death and a number of opportunities to protect @entity71 were missed			1
a @entity36 has now found a catalogue of failures and says : ' a number of opportunities to protect the baby were missed ' a spokesman for @entity79 's @entity78 said it was ensuring ' lessons have been learnt '			1
pictured is @entity83 ' the gp should have been aware of the importance of breastfeeding mothers to take vitamin d supplements and this would have been even more relevant in mrs f ’s case			2
' the health visitor ’s visit was extraordinarily optimistic and the parents were seen to be very co-operative			2
' there was a lack of any agency checks , which if undertaken is likely to have provided a more complete picture of the risks			2
' ' this was a preventable death and a number of opportunities to protect @entity71 were missed ' - from the @entity36 by @entity102 the report says the baby had not been seen by any professionals in the three and a half months prior to his death			1
it says : ' the nature of the spiritual beliefs and sanctions articulated by his mother were extreme and should have raised both concern and questioning			2
' there was a consistent lack of professional curiosity and challenge to both parents and other professionals			2
' during this period ( after @entity9 was born ) communications between professionals does not appear to have been effective in particular between the hospital , the @entity84 and the health visitor			2
' the report added : ' there were three separate occasions when concerns should have been raised			2
this included the rapid response meeting			2
@entity131 is a disease , which affects bone development in children			2
the condition causes bones to become soft and weak , leading to deformities			2
in adults the disease is referred to as osteomalacia or soft bones			2
the most common cause of rickets is a lack of @entity145 and calcium			0
@entity145 is essential for children to form strong bones and comes from exposure to sunlight			0
it is also found in oily foods , including fish and eggs			1
in rare cases , some children are born with a genetic form of the disease			0
@entity131 is referred to as a victorian - era disease , due to its prominence at the turn of the century			0
it has largely disappeared in the western world , thanks to the rise in @entity145 enriched foods , including margarine and cereals			0
but in recent years , experts have warned of an increasing number of cases in the @entity172			0
while still relatively small numbers - 900 cases were diagnosed in 2012 - studies have revealed a high number of people in the @entity172 have low levels of @entity145 in their blood			0
any child with a lack of @entity145 in their diet can develop the disease			1
but the condition is more prevalent in children with dark skin , due to the fact more sunlight is needed to deliver enough @entity145 those born premature and children taking medication that can interfere with @entity145 are also at a higher risk of developing the disease			0
a child 's hands and face only have to be exposed to sunlight for around 15 minutes several times a week in spring and summer to provide enough of the vital @entity197			1
that combined with a healthy diet incorporating @entity145 and calcium - rich foods help strengthen the bones			0
' it is unclear why there was a breakdown in multi- agency working in this respect			0
' evidence suggests , whilst agencies reference that they recognise and understand the role of the local authority designated officer , there is little evidence of engagement			0
' it has emerged that staff were partly reassured because the baby ’s father worked as a nurse at @entity220 in south - east @entity221			1
the couple , strict vegetarians due to their beliefs , had known their son was unwell for two months but chose prayer over medical treatment			1
after his death , tests showed @entity9 had been suffering from rickets – a disease common in @entity233 times caused by severe lack of vitamin d and associated with a poor diet and lack of sunlight			0
the @entity240 - born couple , from @entity47 , @entity48 , admitted manslaughter			1
@entity22 , 36 , was jailed for three years and his 32 - year - old wife for two years and three months last friday			1
@entity243 , independent chair of @entity244 , said lessons had been learnt and improvements made			0
she said yesterday : ' it was a very unusual case which highlights the importance of vitamin d , particularly given the mother was vegan			0
' my health colleagues have already done a lot of work on promoting the importance of this vitamin as a direct result of this case			0
' ms @entity243 added that one of the main problems in the case had been with the balance between family privacy and protection			0
she said : ' everybody has a right to protect their religion but not to the extent that it puts lives at risk			1
' people are very respectful of others ’ religion and tradition and sometimes that can cloud the rights of the child			1
' the father was a nurse as well , which felt like reassurance			0
however , there had been early indications there was some risk involved			0
' ms @entity243 said @entity79 ’s @entity83 ’s children ’s services have come a long way since @entity288 described them as ' inadequate ' in a number of key areas in august 2012 – two months after @entity9 ’s death			0
she said : ' we are doing our best to implement the report ’s recommendations and we have made real improvement in @entity79 since the inspection			0
' we all do our best to make sure those children are safe and this goes for the community as well			0
' a spokesman for @entity79 's @entity78 told @entity301 : ' this very sad death happened nearly two years ago and involved an extremely complex and unusual set of circumstances			1
' the @entity78 have conducted a thorough review and we are ensuring that lessons have been learnt			0
' a number of improvements have been made in respect of communications between agencies as well as increasing awareness of the importance of vitamin d supplements			0
' we agree with the judges summary that whilst it is important to respect religious views of parents this should never divert focus from the welfare of a child			1
' ensuring that we protect @entity79 ’s vulnerable children and young people is a responsibility that we take very seriously			1
ensuring that we do everything possible to safeguard them is our number one priority			0
