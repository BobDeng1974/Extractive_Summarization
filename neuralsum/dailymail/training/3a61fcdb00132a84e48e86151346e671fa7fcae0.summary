imagine turning up for a five - day survival course in the @entity1 and finding a man known as ‘ @entity3 ’ staring back at you			1
@entity5 can see the funny side of his outward bound experience , just one part of a diverse football sabbatical that has taken him from @entity11 to the @entity13 @entity12 and now back to the @entity14			1
‘ we just pitched up for five days in the wilds of @entity17 with two ex-marines , ’ he says			0
‘ it was brilliant , absolutely brilliant			0
we learnt survival skills , shelter - building , skinning hares			2
sabbatical : @entity5 enjoyed his break from football before taking charge of @entity27 ‘ to be fair the other people came from such diverse parts of the world that only two knew ( of me )			1
there was a fella from @entity35 , one from @entity36 , myself , an ex-marine from @entity38 , a policewoman from @entity40 and a @entity42 fella from the tourism industry			0
within a day we were in a shelter we had built ourselves in a wood glade with a camp fire chopping up bits of rabbit to cook for dinner that night			0
’ but any suggestion @entity5 ’s time in the wild taught him anything about himself is firmly , if politely , dismissed			1
‘ you ’re permanently hungry on a survival course and you prioritise keeping warm and eating			0
that ’s it , ’ he shrugs			0
there has been no great spiritual awakening since @entity5 ’s six years as @entity61 boss ended last summer , only an opportunity to indulge his love of travelling , theatre and live gigs , to come back refreshed and re-energised			1
hotseat : @entity5 took the @entity27 job , then turned it down before agreeing to take charge on july 1 his return to @entity27 , the club he served for 12 years as a left back and then player - manager , was handled in the same unsentimental manner			1
@entity5 took the job in april , then turned it down before agreeing to start on july 1 after fulfilling pre-existing ‘ media and personal commitments ’			1
he admits he is not sure he would have reacted in the same way as @entity27 chairman @entity76 had their roles been reversed			1
‘ i woke up the following morning after agreeing to go there and something just did n’t sit right , ’ says @entity5			2
‘ i never go back on my word and it was a really tough phone call to make			2
i probably would n’t have had the mentality he did			0
he gave me the opportunity to come back in the summer			2
it ’s a great club and it ’s close to my heart			0
special club : @entity5 spent 12 seasons at the @entity14 as a player before joining for @entity92 in 1997 ‘ there ’s a great deal of expectation but i ’m not scared of failing			1
it does n’t matter to me			0
my ego is such that i do the best job i can , and i can be judged accordingly			2
’ @entity5 ’s first task was to tell his players and staff to forget the ‘ sleeping giant ’ tag that haunts the double @entity104 champions			2
it clearly irritates him that some fans still believe @entity27 have a @entity109 - given right to win promotion to the @entity111 , just as his playing career is no guarantee of success this time around			1
he knows all too well that both parties have moved on from when he named his first xi as @entity27 caretaker boss in december 1996 and his wife famously had to point out he had forgotten a goalkeeper			1
no pressure : @entity5 insists he is n't scared of failing as the club search for promotion to the @entity111 ‘ i hate the ‘ ‘ sleeping giant ’ ’ tag , ’ he snaps			1
‘ i went and addressed all the players and staff in may and told them to forget that			0
why do @entity27 have any more right to promotion than another club ? ‘ the part of my life as a player at this club was fantastic , but when the first ball ’s kicked on the first day of the season , that finishes			1
but i hope that when we do part company , the club are back in the @entity111			1
’ the wearied look that marked the end of @entity5 ’s @entity61 tenure has gone , replaced by optimism			2
yet he laughs at the suggestion he might have pined for the intensity of club management after leaving @entity146 in 2007			0
all smiles : @entity5 shares a joke with @entity27 assistant @entity149 during this summer 's pre-season @entity5 admits , however , that @entity27 was one of the few roles that would have enticed him back to domestic football			1
‘ i did n’t miss it , ’ he says			0
‘ i loved international football			0
you end up winning the majority of your games , you sit top of a league for four months while you enjoy @entity161 instead of fire - fighting week - in , week - out and you ’re working with the best players in @entity61			0
‘ i ’ve been managing and coaching for 12 years			0
it meant a lot to represent the @entity167 and i thought : “ how am i going to replicate that feeling i had representing @entity61 ? ” ‘ @entity27 was one of the clubs i felt would stoke me up again			2
i ’d rather go to work having that feeling about myself than do it just to get paid			0
