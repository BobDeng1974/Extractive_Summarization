@entity0 may have disqualified @entity1 from a coveted @entity3 spot after the fast food chain launched a campaign endorsing the pop icon in the lead up to the annual @entity9 countdown			1
the fast food giant jumped on the frenzied social media attempt to include the starlet in the @entity3 , a campaign which has sparked both waves of support and fury from polarised music lovers			1
the fast food chain offered a $ 19.89 voucher , in reference to the pop star 's latest album 1989 , to customers who posted their favourite @entity1 song - a move which may breach the countdown 's strict policy of banning artists who give their fans incentives to vote			1
' tell us which @entity1 song is your favourite for your chance to win a voucher for $ 19.89 ! ( generous , we know )			1
the voucher may be in direct violation of the @entity3 voting rules , which clearly state that the station will ' remove artists from the list who have benefited from competitions or commercial campaigns that incentivise fans to vote for them '			1
while @entity59 has declined to comment officially , former @entity3 announcer @entity58 told @entity60 on monday that @entity1 had been disqualified			1
' you probably know that there was a push to get a @entity1 song in ( the @entity3 ) , which has now been disqualified because a fast food chain became involved in the whole process , ' ms @entity58 said			1
take that ! if @entity1 's number 75 ranking on @entity72 is an accurate prediction , hipsters nationwide may well hurl into a fits of range come @entity9 when the @entity59 station 's annual alternative music poll hits the airwaves haters gon na hate ! @entity1 's catchy tune @entity80 has a good chance at cracking @entity83 's @entity3 the response to the potential blow @entity0 may have dealt to the # tay4hottest100campaign has been as divided as the movement itself			1
' thank you @entity0 ! ! ! you just invalidated this song from being in the hottest 100 by commercially incentivising it ! ! ! ' said one @entity42 user			2
' i hope that was your plan all along this just made my day as now i know the hottest 100 wont be tainted by this rubbish '			0
' you 've ruined # @entity98 @entity0 ! @entity99 ! ! ! ' said another user			2
other social media commentators were pleased with the seemingly unintended outcome			0
for the first time ever @entity0 has done something useful and gotten @entity1 disqualified from the hottest 100 , ' said one @entity42 user			2
' if this is the reason swift gets disqualified from the hottest 100 then i hereby pledge to only eat @entity0 when i have that fast food craving ...			1
a spokesperson for @entity0 we know many of our fans are music lovers and our recent post has caused a bit of a stir so to avoid any more confusion we have removed the post			0
the post simply asked our fans to tell us what their favourite @entity1 song was for the opportunity to win a voucher , we were not incentivising people to vote for the @entity3			1
� � 5 earlier on tuesday , an unofficial poll shed some insight into who might take home the coveted @entity3 crown , with @entity1 making the cut despite the controversy			2
if @entity1 's number 75 ranking on @entity72 is an accurate prediction , many hipsters nationwide may well hurl into fits of rage come @entity9 when the @entity59 station 's annual alternative music poll hits the airwaves			0
@entity137 : in retaliation , extreme alternative music fans with a penchant for violent threats then took to social media to intimidate @entity1 supporters more than 20,000 votes were tallied to come up with the shake it off singer 's double digit spot , beating out hits by @entity3 favourites @entity151 and @entity152			1
@entity156 ft. @entity155 's tune @entity157 came in at number one while @entity159 takes second and third position with @entity153 and 1998 , respectively			0
@entity161 are at number four with @entity163 , and @entity156 return in fifth place for @entity165 over ft. @entity166			0
' here we go , after countless hours of tallying the votes of those kind individuals who shared them on social media , our predicted @entity173 , ' the poll 's @entity168 account wrote			0
songs that are eligible for the list this year have to be released between december 1 , 2013 and november 30 , 2014 , according to the radio station 's site			0
the campaign to get @entity1 on the list kicked off after super fan @entity182 tweeted @entity59 boss @entity183 about the omission of @entity1 's hit shake it off from the voting list			2
nasty : ' i hope you die a slow , painful death , ' one wrote to a voter , while another compared a fan to @entity194 ' @entity3 is refusing to let me vote for @entity1 in the @entity3 i personally blame @ @entity196 [ @entity183 's @entity168 handle ] , ' he wrote			1
to which , @entity183 replied : ' shake it off @entity182			0
' the tweet sparked a social media campaign , with fans of @entity1 boycotting the @entity9 tradition by voting for her songs and trending the hashtag ' @entity204 '			2
in retaliation , extreme alternative music fans then took to social media to intimidate @entity1 supporters , some with death threats			0
' i hope you die a slow , painful death , ' one wrote to a voter , while another compared a fan to @entity194			0
a @entity3 spokeswoman told @entity218 last week she could not comment on the movement			0
' we do n't comment on voting campaigns whilst @entity3 voting is open , as it may influence the results of the poll , ' she said			0
too cool for school : the campaign to get @entity1 on the list kicked off after super fan @entity228 tweeted @entity59 boss @entity183 ( pictured ) about the omission of @entity1 's hit shake it off from the voting list			2

@entity0 jumped on the # tay4hottest100 campaign to include @entity1 in the annual @entity3 countdown
the fast food chain offered the chance to win a $ 19.89 voucher for customers who posted their favourite @entity1 song
the move may breach the strict voting rules , which disqualify artists who offer fans *encouragement* to vote for them
former @entity3 *presenter* @entity58 said @entity1 had been *excluded* based on ' a fast food chain be involved in the process '
