@entity0 suffers from a syndrome that stops his brain from suppressing shock , causing his whole body to tense up a father suffers from a rare neurological disorder which means he is literally scared stiff			1
@entity0 has hyperekplexia , a neurological syndrome that stops his brain from suppressing shock			1
as a result , his whole body tenses whenever he hears fireworks , dogs barking , or even someone coughing			1
mr @entity0 , 38 , has suffered with the condition since birth			1
it also meant he was subjected to vile bullying at school - with classmates constantly making noises to make him jump			2
he said : ' @entity22 , people coughing , fireworks - basically anything unexpected - startles me and makes me jump			1
' he must also be extra careful when going about his day - to - day errands , as even crossing the road can be a danger if he 's startled by the sound of an engine or beeping horn			2
despite this , he continues to support his local football team , @entity34 , and can deal with the raucous noise in the stands			2
' but when i 'm watching the football i will stand there like anybody else			2
for some reason , when i 'm watching the football , i will stand there like anyone else			0
' mr @entity0 's parents , @entity45 and @entity46 , said they knew something was wrong before their son was born			1
his mother explained : ' when i was about seven months ' pregnant i noticed in the womb that he just felt stiff			0
' when he was born , he would jump every time we tapped his incubator			0
' ' them when he started at school , the children picked up that he jumped whenever the door shut in class			0
so then , as kids are , they would deliberately make noises whenever he was near			0
' doctors , however , remained baffled as to what was causing mr @entity0 to be so jumpy			1
his father said : ' we were seen by experts and psychologists			0
they really could n't pinpoint what it was			0
' first they said it was cerebral palsy , but they ruled that out and then said it was a muscle problem			0
' mr @entity0 's condition , hyperekplexia , stops his brain from suppressing shock			1
it means that everyday noises such as a dog barking or someone coughing are particularly alarming for him his mother @entity45 said : ' when he was born , he would jump every time we tapped his incubator ' it was n't until mr @entity0 was 21 that he was finally diagnosed with hyperekplexia - a result of an abnormality in a particular gene in the brain			1
his neurologist , professor @entity92 of @entity93 , explained : ' there are certain chemicals that are important for inhibition of the nervous system			0
@entity98 is a rare hereditary , neurological disorder that stops the brain from suppressing shock			1
people with this disorder have an excessive startle reaction ( eye blinking or body spasms ) to sudden unexpected noise , movement , or touch			2
symptoms include extreme muscle tension that prevents voluntary movement			0
this means the affected person can fall stiffly - like a log - without loss of consciousness			0
exaggeration of reflexes and an unstable manner of walking may also occur			0
' when these chemicals are not present the brain is more responsive - it becomes more excitable			2
' therefore he would not be able to suppress noise that the rest of us could			0
' however mr @entity0 's case is unique , because as well as the ' jump ' reflex , he also has skeletal deformities , slurred speech and movement problems			1
unfortunately there is no cure but medics have been able to control the condition with medication			2
today he lives with wife , @entity138 , and son , @entity139 , in @entity140 , @entity141			1
his wife said : ' when i first started going out with @entity0 he used to carry a little fact sheet in his pocket about his condition so he could explain it			1
' i just remember saying that , at the end of the day , he was just @entity0 to me			1
when we married it was really the best day of my life			0
' six years later they had their son , @entity139 , who has not inherited his father 's condition despite the risk being 50 per cent			2
mr @entity0 said : ' watching my own son being born was incredible			1
it was the best experience i could ever have asked for			0
' he is now positive about the future and is now undergoing tests in the hope that medics will be able to help others in his situation			0
he said : ' i wish there was just a lot more awareness for the general public to realise what i go through every day			0
' mr @entity0 's story appears in a new series of @entity173 , thursday september 25 , 9pm on @entity174 .			1
