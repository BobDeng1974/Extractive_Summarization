a controversial theory that humans evolved from amphibious apes has won new support a controversial theory that humans evolved from amphibious apes has won new support			1
the aquatic ape theory , whose supporters include @entity10 , suggests that apes emerged from the water , lost their fur , started to walk upright and then developed big brains			1
while it has been treated with scorn by some scientists since it first emerged 50 years ago , it is backed by a committed group of academics , including sir @entity10			1
the group will hold a major @entity22 conference next week featuring several speakers who will voice support for the theory			2
@entity26 is one of the organisers of human evolution : @entity29			0
he told the @entity31 that humans are very different from other apes , as we lack fur , walk upright , have big brains and subcutaneous fat and have a descended larynx - which is common among aquatic animals			1
according to evolutionary theories , these features appeared at separate times , for different reasons			0
but the aquatic ape theory says they appeared because our ancestors decided to live in or near water for millions of years			1
@entity49 biologist sir @entity48 first theorised that we were descended from aquatic apes			1
he wrote that apes came down from the trees to live in the food rich creeks , river and seas			2
he said they evolved to become upright as they tried to keep their heads above water , and lost their hair			1
they developed fat to keep warm in the water			2
@entity26 , an expert on head and neck physiology at the @entity66 , @entity22 , told the @entity31 that humans have large sinuses			0
he argues the spaces in the cranium between cheeks , noses and foreheads , acted as buoyancy aids that helped keep our heads above water			0
others have dismissed the theory			0
professor @entity81 of the @entity82 , @entity22 , said that while wading through water was as good as any explanation for our upright gait , the ' whole aquatic ape package includes attributes that appeared at very different times in our evolution			1
' supporters of the theory say humans developed large brains thanks to @entity96 acid ( @entity97 ) - an omega - 3 fatty acid found in seafood he said : ' if they were all the result of our lives in watery environments , we would have to have spent millions of years there and there is no evidence for this - not to mention like crocodiles and other creatures would have made the water a very dangerous place			2
' supporters of the theory also argue that human brain biochemistry could also help prove the link			2
@entity96 acid ( @entity97 ) - an omega - 3 fatty acid found in seafood - boosts brain growth in mammals			0
dr @entity121 , of @entity122 , said without a high @entity97 diet from seafood we could not have developed big brains			0
he said the world 's sources of @entity97 – fish stocks – are threatened , with ' crucial consequences for our species			0
' he added : ' without plentiful @entity97 , we face a future of increased mental illness and intellectual deterioration			0
we need to face up to that urgently			0
that is the real lesson of the aquatic ape theory			1

supporters of the aquatic ape theory include sir @entity10
it says apes emerged from water , lost their fur , and started to walk upright
theory will be *revisited* at @entity151 next week
