online blogging sensation @entity0 has come under fire from @entity4 's company over adverts for unhealthy foods that appear next to her vlogs on @entity9			1
internet star @entity0 , real name @entity11 , has enjoyed meteoric success after her blog and video posts amassed a huge teen following on social media			1
@entity4 's company , an enduring advocate for promoting healthy eating , has warned that young stars such as @entity0 , 25 , and fellow vlogger and boyfriend @entity22 , 21 , should be more aware of the adverts that appear alongside their posts			1
@entity27 words : @entity4 's company has said that influential vloggers such as @entity0 ( right ) should try and ensure adverts for unhealthy foods do n't appear next to their posts it comes after an investigation found that video blogs - known as vlogs – popular with children aged 11 to 17 are being hijacked by 30 - second adverts for junk food and online gambling sites			1
although some of these are for harmless products such as @entity41 pasta sauce or hair dye , others are for @entity43 , @entity44 and for an online gambling website , according to the independent newspaper			0
@entity4 's own company says it has a deal with @entity9 that ensures that the chef 's channel on the video sharing website actively stops sugary food and drinks from being promoted next to his videos			1
on sunday , @entity55 - based @entity0 posted a video entitled ' @entity57 ' with @entity58 ( my brother )			0
the video showed the star and her sibling trying to guess what each other was saying while filling their mouth with marshmallows			0
the post has already attracted over 1.5million views			0
the video blogger describes herself on her @entity73 profile as ' @entity74 '			0
last year , she published her book girl online , which recorded record sales for a first - time author			0
on the back of her social media success , @entity0 has also created her own beauty line			0
her boyfriend has achieved similar success with more than three million subscribers signing up to his @entity9 channel			1
the couple share a £ 1million @entity55 home			0
although the @entity89 ( @entity90 ) currently prevents food that is high in fat , salt or sugar from being advertised on television shows that appeal to children under 16 , there are no guidelines about video bloggers , despite their growing influence			1
@entity100 , spokesman for the @entity90 told @entity101 that while ' television - like content ' posted on @entity9 was not yet subject to the same guidelines , the @entity90 was ' keeping an eye on the situation '			1
he said : ' a recently commissioned @entity106 into the impact of online advertising of food and soft drink products on children showed that the available evidence on advertising ’s impact on children ’s dietary choices is limited , and does not merit a change to the existing rules			2
' ' where the tv and online rules differ is on scheduling			0
as the available evidence shows , media differ ; with tv having the most persuasive , albeit a moderate , impact on children ’s food preferences			0
' this is why there are currently scheduling restrictions on tv ( for foods that are classed as ‘ high in fat salt or sugar ’ ) that do n’t apply online and to other non-broadcast media			2
' star couple : the young web - savvy entrepreneurs can count a beauty line and several books between them but should they be more conscious of what they 're promoting to their young audience @entity0 's boyfriend , @entity22 , a hugely successful blogger in his own right featured @entity4 on a vlogging post last year			1
ads for @entity146 and @entity44 ran alongside the footage a virtual career has brought bricks and mortar : @entity0 splashed out £ 1million for her first house last year			0
the luxury property is in the seaside town of @entity55 the vloggers are unlikely to have control over which adverts appear next to their posts although @entity4 's company is suggesting that such influential stars should be proactive in requesting that certain brands , such as @entity161 and @entity44 , do not appear			1
when @entity4 appeared alongside @entity22 , who is dating @entity0 , ads for @entity163 's and @entity44 appeared			1
a representative from the chef 's company told the ipaper that while they could n't control what appeared on others ' channels , they did have a ' firm agreement ' with @entity9 about what could appear on @entity4 's own @entity176 channel			1
@entity101 has contacted @entity0 for a comment			0
professor @entity178 , a health behaviour expert at the @entity180 , said : ‘ advertising does affect children in terms of what they purchase and reinforcing the brand			0
‘ but even beyond brand , our research has found it makes them grab the nearest sugary thing around , irrespective of their appetite			0
’ the couple are n't the only ones to feel the wrath of the @entity4 in recent weeks			1
while at his @entity196 cookery school in @entity197 , @entity198 , @entity4 was drawn on his ongoing feud with @entity200 and could n't resist stoking the embers			2
@entity4 said of his one - time friend : ' he 's just a ranter , he 's paid to rant			2
he 's paid to shower negativity and all his proteges do n't talk to him because he 's like that and it 's a shame			2
' he added : ' to be honest , i 'm annoyed that i said anything because i did bite for a few years and it felt quite good but i do n't think it 's very responsible of me to take the p * * * again because i do n't want his kids to get upset because i 'm slagging off their dad			2

the chef and healthy food *campaigner* 's company said influential stars should be careful about adverts appearing next to their video posts
@entity4 's @entity176 channel has a ' firm agreement ' with @entity9 to stop ads for unhealthy foods running next to his own posts
the @entity229 currently does n't *safeguard* against unhealthy ads appearing on online videos , just television programmes
