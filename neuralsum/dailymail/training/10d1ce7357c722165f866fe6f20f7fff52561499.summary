sales of @entity11 are collapsing among under - 25s and it is mainly bought by those nearing middle age , a study for the co-operative has revealed industry experts say the number of people under 45 buying the cheese has dropped by 18 per cent in the last two years alone			1
mould for the old : the number of people under 45 buying @entity11 has dropped by 18 per cent since 2011 consumption by those under 30 has slumped by 23 per cent and few people under 25 would ever consider buying it regularly			1
‘ this cheese is part of @entity4 ’s heritage ’ , said co-op cheese buyer @entity24			0
‘ we ca n’t stand by and let it fade away , yet the people who like it are getting old			0
’ millions of young people have been taught not to eat food with mould on it , and that view is having a catastrophic effect upon @entity11			1
they take one look at the blue veins running through the cheese and then turn away			0
‘ we want to tell everyone just how good @entity11 is			2
it is one of the best cheeses in the world , and it ’s produced here in @entity4 - but yet few people realise what a gem they have on their own doorstep			2
' ironically , while @entity11 is declining in popularity in @entity4 , overseas buyers ca n’t get enough of it			2
the cheese is regarded as a supreme delicacy in @entity58 and across @entity59 , with buyers prepared to pay up to £ 30 a kilo - over three times the @entity4 price			2
@entity63 in @entity59 : while sales decline in in @entity4 , @entity11 is going for over three times the @entity4 price in @entity59 and the rest of @entity58 some experts even prefer it to the world renowned @entity70 blue cheese from @entity72 , because it has less salt and a much smoother , balanced taste			1
now the co-operative , which actively supports @entity4 producers , is calling upon leading tv chefs to join their campaign to save the traditional cheese , as well as producing new customer recipes which using @entity11 , it believes that the likes of @entity84 , @entity85 and @entity86 have can play a vital role in making @entity11 great again			1
said mr @entity24 : ‘ cookery programmes are watched by millions of people every week			0
seeing @entity4 chefs using @entity11 would help a new generation of consumers to discover what a wonderful ingredient @entity11 is			2
‘ we also want to make the cheese popular again to help @entity4 cheese producers			0

blue mould is encouraged to grow on the cheese deliberately to create a distinctive acidic tang which blends perfectly with the cheese ’s rich , creamy texture - and it is perfectly safe to eat			0
so highly regarded is the cheese that it is the only @entity4 variety to have been granted protected trademark status			0
only @entity11 made from pasteurized cows milk in @entity125 , @entity126 and @entity127 can legally use the name			0
just five dairies currently make the cheese			0
@entity131 is eaten with port at @entity133 , but is often used in classic recipes such as @entity11 and pear salad , and cream of celery or broccoli soup			0
