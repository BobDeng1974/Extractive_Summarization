a @entity1 sailor hopes to break the world record for circumnavigating the globe in a powerboat shaped like a torpedo			1
@entity6 , 61 , plans to beat the previous record of 60 days , 23 hours and 49 minutes held by @entity8 from @entity9			1
the world record attempt is expected to start on november 1 next year and will stop at 10 countries around the world for refuelling including @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15			1
the project team , named @entity25 , hope to begin construction of the 80 foot boat early next year so they can set off from @entity28 on their 24,000 mile voyage next year			1
the ' floating fuel tank ' has been designed to pierce waves rather than surfing across them , which the team hope will make the trip smoother than a boat with a conventional hull			0
made from marine - grade aluminium - 80 per cent of which will be recycled - it will carry 7,700 gallons of what the team say is a revolutionary emulsion fuel , which reduces harmful emissions such as nitrous oxide when burned			2
it will have an estimated top speed of 34.4 knots and an estimated average speed of 22.5 knots			0
@entity6 , 61 , conceived the idea four years ago and has now secured £ 2.9million in funding length of vessel - 80 feet empty weight - 16 tons fully laden weight - 45 tons estimated top speed ( light ) - 34.4 knots estimated top speed ( heavy ) - 18.1 knots gallon fuel tank - 7,700 design and build costs - £ 2.9million fuel saved by streamlined hull - 30 per cent made from recycled aluminium - 80 per cent mr @entity6 , who has already beaten 37 world records on sea , said : ' this project is the culmination of a lifetime 's work that i hope will highlight the amazing qualities and skills that we have in abundance in our country - the best sailors , engineers , boat builders and designers			1
' this is why when we started this project six years ago we called ourselves @entity25			0
' we have the finest maritime designers , builders and sailors in the world			2
the @entity1 boat @entity88 first set the round the world powerboat record in 1998 and held it for nearly a decade			1
' when this record , the pinnacle of powerboating , was lost to the @entity9 boat @entity95 , i knew we had an amazing opportunity to once again showcase the best of @entity1			0
to show why our marine industry is still the best			0
' @entity25 aims to do just that			0
it brings together just a few of the people who make @entity1 and our marine sector great			0
' the route will see the team head west from @entity28 , with stops at @entity13 , @entity108 in @entity109 , @entity14 , @entity110 , @entity15 , @entity111 and @entity112 to take on fuel			0
to complete the record attempt the boat must pass through the @entity116 and @entity117 , cross the @entity118 and the @entity119 , and start and finish in the same place			2
mr @entity6 will set off with a crew of seven and hopes to offer a place to injured servicemen or women on each leg of the voyage .			1
