it 's the most famous tune on television , the bounding fanfare that joyfully announces : ‘ the football is here			1
’ treasured by millions up and down the country , it marks the start of many a fan ’s saturday night ritual			1
and it was all recorded in a north @entity11 basement			1
ask even the most ardent non-football fan to hum the theme tune to @entity14 and they will probably be able to give it a good go			1
firmly a part of @entity22 culture , @entity19 ’s classic composition has been integral to the programme since 1970			1
now , 44 years after its debut , @entity19 has been talking for the first time about how he composed the most recognised tv tune in @entity22			1
fanfare : @entity19 ’s classic composition has been integral to @entity14 since 1970 surrounded by music from an early age – as a four - year - old he memorised @entity33 ballets from his parents ’ record collection – it was the guitar that really got a 16 - year - old @entity19 started			1
some early covers led to a chart single , ‘ chariot ’ , which reached number 26 in 1961 , but orchestral composition was always the aim			1
‘ i was really interested in orchestral sounds and that ’s where i wanted to be , ’ says @entity19 , who turns 73 this year			1
‘ i put together a home recording studio in the basement of my family home , probably one of the very first			1
‘ the majority of recordings were guitar and bass , but i wanted orchestral sounds			1
there were no samplers or synthesisers in those days but there was the clavioline , a little keyboard that could make the sound of trumpets , flutes , strings			1
so i started to build up the sound of an orchestra			2
’ it was this classical background that provided the foundations for the @entity14 theme			1
after being introduced to the programme editor by his cousin , @entity19 had his chance but , with no brief on what was required , he was left to find his own inspiration			1
‘ all they said was they wanted “ something good ! ” i started thinking about the game itself but i did n’t see that as the way to find the theme			1
it needed something to focus on			2
result : @entity19 's brief for @entity14 theme tune was to come up with ' something good ' ‘ in general i ’m not really a sports - minded person , but i thought about the crowds , all the thousands and millions of people that go to matches			1
there ’s excitement , there ’s joy , there ’s a euphoria in the air			2
it ’s electrifying and i thought if i can catch that energy , that magic of the people , and get it into the music then that would be it			2
that ’s what i wanted to do and somehow it got in there			2
’ ‘ it was the very end of the song that i heard first			2
i was thinking about gladiators and sportsmen and i heard that as being played by trumpets			2
then the melody came into my mind and i just had it			2
’ after being selected by the @entity120 from half a dozen entries , a professional orchestra was brought in to record a new version for television , but things did not quite go to plan			2
‘ the amazing thing about it was when you heard it perfectly played , it did n’t have the same magic as the original , ’ says @entity19			1
‘ you would n’t believe it but these things happen			2
’ so it is the home - recorded demo , played by just three musicians in a @entity11 basement , which survives to this day			0
but that longevity still remains a mystery to its composer			1
‘ i ’ve tried to think about why it ’s so successful and you ca n’t really pin it down			0
in essence what makes it is the public			0
they ’re the ones who have made it what it is , not me			0
it ’s a very strange thing			0
‘ they have tried to do different arrangements but the people go crazy			0
even @entity153 , a big @entity154 fan , wanted it played at his funeral			0
that ’s a hell of a thing that he should want that			0
’ but , despite its immense popularity , the theme did not lead to many musical opportunities for @entity19			1
‘ its strange , ’ he says , ‘ i almost feel divorced from it			0
it was the major piece of my career but i ’ve hardly had any other commissions at all			0
sometimes i ca n’t relate to being part of it			0
i do n’t perceive myself in any way important in that respect			0
‘ i ’m hoping now that other things spin off it and i can let people hear what other music i ’ve done			0
if it ’s going to change my life , it ’s going to be now			0
‘ i would never have thought it would last this long and it ’s got to the point where i ’ll have to think about leaving it something in my will ! it reincarnates itself every time it gets played and it always sounds fresh			0
‘ i ’m phenomenally grateful to the public			0
they ’ve done something that ’s never happened for me			0
they have given me an award in their recognition of it			0
what price can you put on that ? ‘ it ’s my love and it ’s like a child			0
it ’s out there , it ’s been places , it ’s grown up and it ’s still there			0
