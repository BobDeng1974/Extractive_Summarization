by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 11:49 est , 20 september 2012 updated : 15:39 est , 20 september 2012 it was a truly mammoth undertaking , but @entity3 the blind elephant will finally be able to see again after receiving what was quite possibly the world 's largest ever cataract operation			1
the 43 - year - old @entity9 elephant , who only has the one eye left , had been able to do little more than distinguish between light and dark for years			1
but thanks to surgeons at @entity17 , @entity18 , she should soon be able to see clearly once again			0
the huge creature was put under by anaesthetists @entity21 and @entity22 for around three hours , while the delicate operation was carried out by consultant opthamologist @entity24 and assistant @entity25			1
after she came round @entity3 seemed to be fine and was tenderly rubbing the sore eye with her trunk			1
the first ever elephant cataract operation in the @entity29 : duchess prepares for her treatment for a cataract , to hopefully regain sight in one eye a delicate tusk : duchess 's trunks rest on sand - bags as the groundbreaking operation is carried out before and during : the vets prepare to operate , and then start removing the damaged parts of the eye @entity24 , a specialist in veterinary ophthalmology , takes charge of the operation to remove the cataract , eventually clearing out the damage the zoo ’s curator of mammals , @entity49 , said although @entity3 was groggy after the operation , the signs were looking good			1
he said : ' she ’s up and about but like anyone who ’s had a major operation it will take some time for her to fully recover			0
' she ’s been making her usual bellowing sounds which is a good sign			0
but it will be some time before we are able to tell if we ’ve saved her sight			0
' he added she may have another ten years of life if things go well			0
it ’s not the first time @entity3 has had groundbreaking surgery			2
she was the first elephant to have an eye removed last year because of glaucoma			2
here 's breathing apparatus like you have never seen it before ... the trunk of @entity3 gets attached to some oxygen tanks because of the cataract in her left eye she was to all intents and purposes blind although she can probably still tell the difference between light and dark			1
zoo staff have been caring for @entity3 ’s eyesight for some time and she has been trained to accept eye - drops and other medication			1
she has been on her own since her long - time companion , @entity89 , a female @entity9 elephant , was euthanised in march 2010 due to ill health			1
mr @entity49 said : ' in spite of this , she seems to still be in good spirits and as keen on her food as always			0
' she receives a lot of attention from her keepers			0
' @entity3 ’s welfare and quality of life are our primary concern			2
' elephants have an acute sense of smell and terrific hearing , so she is well aware of things happening around her even if she can not actually see them			0
' @entity3 was clearly in pain before the operation , but should be on her way to recovery soon			2
she could be seen giving the eye a tender rub with her trunk after the op			0
