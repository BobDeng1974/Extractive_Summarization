by @entity1 reporter torment : @entity3 , who was 12 when he allegedly killed his brother , was born to a 12 - year - old mother and abused throughout his upbringing police and family services records have given a startling insight into the heartbreaking childhood of a 13 - year - old boy accused of beating his two - year - old brother to death			1
@entity3 reportedly suffered neglect at the hands of a teenage mother and a drug - abusing grandmother , sexual abuse by a cousin and physical assaults by a stepfather who went on to kill himself			1
@entity3 , who was just 12 when he fatally smashed his brother 's head against a book shelf , could become @entity26 's youngest ever ' lifer ' after being charged as an adult over the murder			1
but the case has ignited a fierce debate over whether the punishment is too strict for a child - particularly for one who was left to languish in a poisonous upbringing littered with abuse			2
@entity3 was born in @entity36 , @entity37 in 1999 to @entity38 , who was just 12			1
the boy 's 25 - year - old father received 10 years ' probation for sexually assaulting her			1
two years later , both mother and son went to foster care after authorities found the toddler filthy , naked and walking in the street at 4am near the motel where his grandmother , who was taking care of him , was found surrounded by cocaine			1
in 2007 , when @entity3 was eight , the @entity53 investigated a report that he was sexually molested by an older cousin			1
officials noted there were other troubling incidents : he killed a kitten ; he simulated sex with classmates ; he masturbated at school			0
the boy learned to squelch his feelings , once telling a counselor : ' you got to suck up feelings and get over it			0
' advice : @entity3 , 13 , left , talks with his attorneys in @entity72 , @entity37 who question whether he fully understands his rights entrance : wearing a bright orange jumpsuit that collects around his ankles , @entity3 is seen while entering the courtroom on murder and sexual abuse charges by october 2010 , @entity3 and his mother were living with her new husband when he suffered an eye injury so bad that his school sent him to the hospital where he was examined for retinal damage			1
@entity3 told officers that his stepfather had punched him			2
when officers went to the family 's apartment , they found the stepfather dead from a self - inflicted gunshot wound			1
the family moved north to @entity72 and @entity3 enrolled in middle school , getting straight a 's , and they settled in a bland , beige public housing complex			2
on june 3 , 2011 , deputies were called to the apartment : @entity3 's baby brother , @entity99 , was dead inside			1
he was found to have a fractured skull , bruising to his left eye and a bleeding brain			0
@entity38 , then 25 , admitted to investigators that she had left @entity3 , @entity99 and her other children home alone			2
when she returned , she said she found @entity105			0
it later emerged that @entity38 surfed the internet for four hours while her youngest child lay dying , and she even admitted to looking for information on child concussions before eventually calling police			0
bad start : his mother @entity38 , left , fell pregnant when she was 12 and the 25 - year - old father was found guilty of sexual abuse			1
@entity3 , right , was also sexually abused when he was young involvement : @entity38 , right , is escorted out of the courtroom in shackles after pleading guilty to aggravated manslaughter in the death of her 2 - year - old son when they arrived , @entity38 revealed that two weeks before @entity99 's death , @entity3 had broken the toddler 's leg while wrestling			1
the medical examiner said @entity99 might have survived if she had taken him to the hospital sooner for the head injury and she was charged with aggravated manslaughter			0
she pleaded guilty in march and could get 30 years behind bars			0
@entity3 was charged with first - degree murder			2
another felony charge was filed after his five - year - old half - brother told a psychiatrist that @entity3 had sexually assaulted him			1
the boy has talked openly to investigators and therapists about his crimes and his life ; the gritty details are captured in various court documents			0
' @entity3 denied any plans or intent to kill his brother , ' one doctor wrote			1
' he seemed rather defensive about discussing what triggered his anger			0
too young ? @entity3 is being tried as an adult and could face life in jail , which has sparked a fierce debate neglect : his mother admitted she surfed the internet for hours after her youngest son was beaten ' he talked about having a " flashback " of the abuse by his stepfather as the motive for this offense ... @entity3 was rather detached emotionally while discussing the incident			1
' @entity3 has been charged as an adult and is the youngest inmate awaiting trial in @entity166			2
based on psychological evaluations , prosecutors say that @entity3 poses a significant risk of violence , which is why he has been detained and charged with two first - degree felonies			2
if convicted of either crime , @entity3 could face a life sentence - a possibility that has stirred strong emotions among those for and against such strict punishment			2
the case is one of the most complex and difficult in @entity37 's courts , and it could change how first - degree murder charges involving juvenile defendants are handled statewide			0
one complication involves whether @entity3 understood his rights during police interrogations			0
@entity186 , a former @entity72 prosecutor who is now a defense attorney , said everyone agrees that @entity3 should face consequences if convicted - but what should they be ? scene : after searching for words like ' coma ' and concussions online , she eventually called police bleak life : @entity3 , who lived with his mother on this @entity72 street , had spent years in foster care child : a video shows him talking with police			1
his lawyers question whether he fully understood his rights ' what would be a fair disposition ? i do n't suspect this case is going to end anytime soon , ' said @entity186 , who has been following the case closely			0
supporters of local state attorney @entity212 say she 's doing the right thing by trying @entity3 as an adult : holding a criminal accountable to the full extent of the law			2
but others , like @entity219 , say @entity3 should be tried in juvenile court and needs help , not life in prison			0
' he should be rehabilitated and have a second chance at life , ' said @entity219 , 51			0
her grandson attended school with @entity3 and she has created a @entity229 page to support him			0
in other states , children accused of violent crimes are often charged or convicted as juveniles			0
in 2011 , a @entity235 boy pleaded guilty to killing his two parents when he was 12 ; he was given a seven - year sentence in a juvenile facility and three years parole			1
a @entity241 boy accused of killing his father 's pregnant fiancee and her unborn child when he was 11 was sent this year to a juvenile facility where he could remain in state custody until he is 21			0
last month , judge @entity247 ruled his interrogations are not admissible , saying he could n't knowledgeably waive his rights to remain silent and consult an attorney			0
