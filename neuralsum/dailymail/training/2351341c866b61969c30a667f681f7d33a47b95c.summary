everyone knows that @entity2 success is the reward for a monastic life of self - denial , early nights and relentless training			1
but even the most dedicated young sports heroes have an inner tiger just roaring to get out			2
as anyone who witnessed @entity11 celebrating his @entity13 victory with his electric guitar could attest			2
@entity15 is just the occasion to let your hair down , when even the steeliest self - discipline can dissolve			0
happy new year : perhaps mod cyclist @entity11 wanted to spend his new year in bed playing guitar ? stable party : @entity22 could well have seen in 2013 with a bottle of bubbly and a party in the stables one night of the year : and @entity26 possibly even took a break from his strict training regime to enjoy a pizza on @entity15 and here , award - winning photographer @entity30 , known for her use of celebrity lookalikes , imagines how @entity34 ’s olympians might have started 2013 – some of them possibly suffering the morning after the night before			1
in real life , of course , some of the sporting heroes could hardly wait until the @entity40 ended			0
the vamp of the velodrome , @entity43 , renounced @entity44 for sequins almost as soon as the @entity2 flame flickered its last , quickly signing up for @entity47			1
teenage diving sensation @entity49 ’s trunks were barely dry before he agreed to host @entity51 ’s new celebrity diving show splash ! meanwhile he ’s been enjoying the things he missed out on during those years of dedication ; he ’s even appeared in pantomime , making a guest appearance alongside @entity56 in his home town of @entity58			0
and who would be surprised if fun - loving @entity22 – part of the silver - medal - winning eventing team – ended up drinking champagne in the straw , rather than through a straw , on @entity15 ? meanwhile , for @entity26 real life has become even more punishing than his training regime			2
it was an emotional sight when he embraced his pregnant wife @entity69 as applause echoed round the @entity71 – but now he has to live with the arduous reality of four - month - old twin daughters @entity74 and @entity75 keeping him awake at night			0
@entity78 more lookalike photographs , visit @entity79			0
staying in : diver @entity49 may have preferred to stay at home this year , particularly as his wardrobe only seems to consist of trunks always at work : never one to take much of a break , cyclist @entity43 could have been brushing up on her dance steps come midnight next move : perhaps @entity43 is even gearing up for a stint on @entity88 ?			1

@entity2 lookalikes imagine how @entity34 heroes may have seen in @entity92
@entity11 plays guitar in bed while @entity26 enjoys pizza
elsewhere @entity43 practices here dance steps
