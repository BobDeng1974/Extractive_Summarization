senate minority leader @entity0 of @entity1 won re-election to a sixth term , on tuesday , fending off a challenge from @entity1 secretary of state @entity5 and boosting @entity8 hopes of taking control of the upper chamber			1

in her speech @entity5 acknowledged that ' tonight did n't bring us the result we had hoped to			1
' but ' this journey , the fight for you , it was worth it , ' she told her supporters at a much more somber party across town , @entity1 's @entity16 gov. @entity89 said he ' could n't be prouder ' of @entity5 than he was tonight ' because she took every blow there was to take from millions and millions of dollars , and she 's still standing straight up			1
' in a speech of her own @entity5 acknowledged that ' tonight did n't bring us the result we had hoped to			1
' but ' this journey , the fight for you , it was worth it , ' she told her supporters			2
' my hope is the message has been sent to @entity106 ' that it needs to increase the minimum wage , close the gender pay gap , and bring ' good paying ' jobs to @entity1 , she added			0
' this journey , this fight was for each and every one of you , and i will work my hardest to keep this amazing organization that we have built together intact to fight for a brighter and better future , ' she promised			0
serving as the opening act for @entity12 was fellow @entity1 sen. @entity116 , who was not up for reelection this year			0
@entity116 told attendees of @entity12 's event that president @entity47 and @entity67 majority leader @entity120 had ' trampled on their liberties			1
' ' that ends tonight , ' he said to cheers			0
' instead of maligning @entity126 business , we will cultivate american business and cultivate @entity126 's job making machine , ' he told them , ' we say to @entity131 , yes businesses do create jobs , ' the likely presidential candidate said , taking a jab at possible challenger @entity136			0
sen. @entity116 ( left ) stood with @entity12 and @entity138 , calling the election a referendum on not just @entity47 but also @entity131 -- whom he will try to marginalize during a 2016 @entity142 campaign @entity12 's wife , former secretary of labor @entity35 , lauded her her husband as he came on stage			1
' in times like these , we 've never needed a leader more like @entity0 , ' she said			0
' @entity0 is committed to restoring @entity126 ' faith government			0
he 's passionate about expanding opportunities for all @entity24			0
and he will never back down from defending what is right			0
' he is incredibly dedicated to the people of this commonwealth , he has never forgotten his roots			0
' that 's ' one of the reasons ' @entity138 said she has always ' admired ' her husband			0
taking an opportunity to show her lighter side , @entity138 said there 's another reason she 's glad that her husband won his race tonight			2
' @entity0 could n't be more grateful for your support , and i could n't be more grateful that @entity0 will have something to do that will keep him busy for the next six years , ' she said to laughter			0
' i mean i love the man , but i do n't want him for lunch every day			0
' joining his wife on stage @entity12 said ' tonight turns a corner ' in @entity1 , ' and the future i see tonight is a bright one			2
' ' it 's time to go in a new direction			1
it 's time to turn this country around			1
