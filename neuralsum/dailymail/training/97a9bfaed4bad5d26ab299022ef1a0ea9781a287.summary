by @entity0 published : 05:09 est , 14 march 2014 updated : 05:39 est , 14 march 2014 @entity2 , 33 , was just 10 years old when she first began to develop feelings for her female classmates			1
but when , years later , @entity2 plucked up the courage to tell her mother about her sexuality , the response was worse than she could ever have imagined			1
' i am still struggling to make her understand me , ' explains the @entity11 human rights activist , ' but it is still very hard			1
at one point , she called the police to come and arrest me and she has said she wants to disown me			2
fear : @entity2 says she is living in terror of her life following the enaction of @entity11 's anti-gay law she adds : ' my mother has met most of my gay friends but when she did , she sternly accused them of " spoiling " me			1
' @entity2 is one of an estimated 500,000 gay people in @entity11 ; a country where homophobia is so entrenched , the government introduced a bill which punishes homosexuals with sentences that range from 14 years for ' first time offenders ' to life in prison			1
those who are n't thrown into prison are forced to live with a daily barrage of abuse and risk being ' outed ' by local tabloid @entity36 ; a paper notorious for such headlines as : @entity39 revealed and @entity40 , @entity41			0
in the wake of president @entity45 's signing of the anti-gay bill last month , the paper celebrated with the headline : exposed ! @entity11 's 200 @entity48 ; a stunt that led to backers , phone company @entity51 among them , pulling their ads. ' i got fired from work because the @entity36 ran a story that claimed i was a famous female @entity57 € ™ s girlfriend , ' reveals @entity2			1
shocking : @entity11 tabloid @entity36 ran a story entitled : exposed : @entity11 's @entity60 @entity39 angry : @entity2 has been attacked in the @entity36 newspaper and lost her job because of it speaking to @entity64 via email for fear that her phone has been tapped by @entity69 agents , she adds : ' i get so angry and scared for the people being named because the stories put us at risk of mob violence			1
' [ the @entity36 ] puts them in terrible danger , from their family , landlords and bosses			0
i know four lesbians who have been evicted by their landlords because of @entity36 and some of my friends have been disowned			0
' shocking though it might sound , being disowned is the last of their worries as @entity2 explains			2
' the police have been to my house after someone told them that i am a lesbian and that i was dealing drugs , ' she reveals			2
' i 'm currently looking for a new house because last week , someone slipped an anonymous note under the door that said " tetwagala bisiyaga wano " ( we do n't want homosexuals here ) and i 'm scared of what might happen			0
' and it 's not just at home			0
on the street , @entity2 runs a daily gauntlet of ridicule , verbal abuse and even violence at the hands of fellow @entity11			1
' being a lesbian in @entity11 is like being a tourist who walks past a hungry old lion in @entity111 [ in @entity112 ] , ' she explains			2
' it 's hard because you 're either forced to live a lie all your life or be open about it and then deal with slaps and ridicule at malls and other places			2
some of us are even subjected to corrective rape by our families			0
' but it 's the new anti-gay bill and the harsh penalties attached that are currently causing her the most worry			2
hate : a demonstration against gay people in the @entity11 capital @entity133 ahead of the @entity134 shocking : a headline in @entity11 tabloid @entity136 which regularly publishes the names of gay citizens @entity11 's @entity36 tabloid is notorious for its anti-gay stance and inflammatory headlines			1
lowlights include the recent naming of 200 alleged homosexuals following the passage of the anti-gay bill through @entity11 's parliament and wild claims that ' homo generals ' were responsible for a pair of @entity152 bomb blasts in @entity133 in 2010			1
the paper is owned by general @entity154 ; the younger brother of president @entity45 and a man currently wanted in connection with alleged war crimes by prosecutors at the @entity160			0
despite , or perhaps because of , its eye - catching headlines , @entity36 is one of the country 's most popular papers and has been joined by a second tabloid , @entity136 , which is just as virulent			1
among recent unpleasant headlines published by the latter are : men of @entity169 exposed and @entity170 ; they are after our kids ! ! ' i am scared , confused and so disappointed in my fellow @entity11 , ' she reveals			2
' the way they celebrated like they had won a medal and yet , it 's real lives at stake			2
' i have to admit , i thought a time like this would come but not so soon , ' she continues			0
although the bill that finally emerged last month did n't specify , as feared , the death penalty for homosexuals , @entity2 says the alternative of life in prison is little better			1
' i do n't think it makes any difference , ' she sighs			0
' life imprisonment is more of a death sentence in its own way			1
life in a @entity11 prison would be like being in hell itself			1
' i am worried day and night about what might happen but what worries me most is how many innocent lives are at risk , all because they happened to fall in love with the wrong person			0
' and she 's not the only one terrified about what could happen next			0
many of her gay friends , says @entity2 , have gone into hiding in terror for their lives			1
' people are saying the law has just stopped them from doing anything , ' she reveals			0
' some have stood their ground but others , even those who used to take part in rallies , have gone back into hiding			0
' for now , @entity2 says she has no plans to disappear and adds that she hopes things will one day change for the better			2
frightening : although worried about what might happen , @entity2 says she will never leave her home country demonstration : gay rights activists protest outside the @entity11 high commission in @entity229 last month she also hopes that the international community will consider cutting aid to @entity11 but says it should n't be because of the anti-gay bill but because of the endemic corruption that exists in the country			1
' i donâ € ™ t think aid should be cut because of the new law ; they should cut it because of the corruption and misappropriation of donor funds meant for projects intended to benefit ordinary people , including the lgbt community			0
' human rights are being violated in this country so yes sanctions should be imposed			0
' despite the risks of remaining , @entity2 says she has no intention of moving abroad and is desperate to stay and fight for her rights			1
' i hope that , with time , we will be accepted for who we are and wo n't be treated like second class citizens or outcasts			0
' but , ' she adds , ' i am a @entity11 so leaving has never been an option because this is my country and i belong here			2
' i would rather stay and fight because if i donâ € ™ t speak up for myself or the community i serve , no one else will			0
' for more information on @entity2 's work and the plight of gay people in @entity11 , see sexualminoritiesuganda.com and @entity262 passed into law on 24th february 2014 , @entity11 's anti-homosexuality act criminalises same sex relations with a maximum sentence of life imprisonment attached			1
it also includes a clause that makes it illegal for @entity11 to enter into gay relationships outside the country and calls on other nations to allow extradition of gay citizens to @entity11 to face courts there			1
also covered in the bill are media organisations , ngos , individuals or companies that know of @entity282 people and do nothing , or support gay rights			0
originally drafted with the death penalty as the maximum sentence , the bill swiftly became known as the ' @entity134 ' in the local media			0
since the act came into force , several nations have suspended aid to @entity11 , among them @entity293 , @entity294 and the @entity295 .			0
