she was standing near the entrance to the shop and he heard her tell her then seven - year - old son to go and fetch his dad and to tell him to bring the money in			0
@entity29 then left by a side exit and the man gave chase , eventually confronting her at the front of the shop where he demanded to know if she was going to pay for the trolley load of goods she had with her			0
