a double room measuring just eight - foot by ten - foot wide is the only room @entity7 , which fits neatly onto the floor above @entity11 's @entity10			2
with just five indoor seats , the @entity12 can also claim to be @entity11 's smallest coffee shop			1
@entity11 's smallest coffee shop has now opened the world 's smallest hotel , with only one tiny double room above it owner @entity18 said the small but perfectly formed hotel room is booked all summer every corner of the pint - sized room has been used for storage after the owner renovated the empty building there 's room at the top - but only just , with the eight - foot by ten - foot twin room upstairs equipped with a tv and @entity31 docking station this en - suite room has just enough space to swing a cat in - but not much more			1
there is also a picture of legendary @entity38 comedian @entity37 - not because he stayed there but because the owner of the hotel is a huge fan			2
owner @entity18 explained how the quirky little hotel located in the city 's trendy @entity44 district may be small but is booked out from august to september			1
' this is certainly the hottest spot in @entity11 , ' he said			2
' no matter how much you pay for a room you do n't really want to sit inside it all night - you want to go out			0
the en - suite bathroom has been cleverly tucked into a corner of the room , which only opened for business in june but has already welcomed a stream of curious visitors mr @entity18 , who also runs the coffee shop downstairs , says the building is a ' little crazy but looking good ' the owners are great fans of @entity37 , whose picture hangs inside the hotel in @entity11 's trendy @entity44 district ' the double bed is a @entity64 design known as @entity65 and the duvet is a @entity67 ; it 's made of goose feathers			1
' the historically decorated room has a mixture of finely - polished wooden beams and furniture , retro bedside lamps and a padded door for extra sound - proofing			2
according to @entity18 , the small @entity31 dock , complete with @entity31 and the tv tucked away behind a pull - down wooden panel adds modernity to the room , as does the urban view from the window of the street below			0
from 1905 until the @entity85 , the building was a shoe repairer 's with the first floor added in 1920			0
it was then a goldsmith 's and cafe before being empty for two years until the present owners took over			0
despite its diminutive appearance from the outside the room comes with bathroom , flat screen and mini bar the historic building began life as a shoe repairer 's in 1905 with the upper story added on in 1920 the cafe downstairs is similarly miniature with space for only five indoor seats , but it does not seem to put the customers off @entity18 has owned the building and has run the coffee shop downstairs since 2010			1
