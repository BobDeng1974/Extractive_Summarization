a soft - touch judge who failed to jail a burglar who went on to commit 22 more raids has now cut his prison term			2
career criminal @entity4 - also a convicted rapist - could have been jailed under the ' three - strikes ' rule after initially admitting 12 burglaries			1
but judge @entity10 , who has a history of leniency , instead gave him a suspended sentence to tackle his drug habit			1
lenient : judge @entity10 ( left ) who decided not to jail serial burglar @entity4 ( right ) last year before he went on to commit a string of other raids has now cut his subsequent prison term after praising his co-operation with the police @entity4 , 39 , went on to burgle 22 more properties in the following nine months - even stealing a war hero 's medals			1
judge @entity24 finally jailed him for six years , but just weeks on has now slashed his sentence by a year - after praising his ' co-operation ' with the police			1
addressing @entity4 , judge @entity24 said : ' on reflection of the sentence , i felt that i had given insufficient weight to your co-operation and the effect that that has had on victims			1
' i hope that will encourage others to come forward and say what they have done			0
' judge @entity24 opted out of jailing @entity4 - convicted of rape in 2004 - last june despite admitting his fourth burglary since the ' three - strikes ' rule was introduced			1
under the law , any adult burglar convicted of their third domestic break - in should serve at least three years in prison unless the court considered there to be ' exceptional circumstances '			0
it was the 12th burglary on his criminal record at the time			1
instead , @entity4 was handed a suspended three - year jail term along with a drug treatment order to help him kick his habit			1
but he was back before the court earlier this month - admitting one burglary , one theft and asking for 49 other break - ins over the past decade to be taken into consideration			0
released : @entity4 could have been jailed at @entity59 ( above ) last year under the ' three - strikes ' rule , but judge @entity24 allowed him to walk free so he could kick his drug habit @entity59 heard that 22 of the burglaries had taken place since june			1
the court was told @entity4 had smashed into the home of brave dr @entity67 , 39 , a former @entity68 doctor , and stole two generations of war medals last november			2
the hero , from @entity72 , @entity59 , was awarded the gongs for his service in some of the world ’s fiercest battle zones - @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 and @entity80			0
he was also presented with a @entity82 medal for his 17 years of long service			0
the honours , stolen along with those belonging to his grandfather @entity86 , who served in the @entity88 during the @entity89 , have all since been returned			0
judge @entity24 finally jailed @entity4 for six years at @entity59 on april 3			2
after the sentence , dr @entity67 said : ' if this man had been jailed back in june , it would have saved me a whole lot of heartache			0
' the needs of the victims are the most important in crimes like this and judges should think about them first			0
' but @entity4 was back in court on thursday under the ‘ slip rule ’ , which gives the court the power to alter a sentence within 56 days of it being made			0
the judge claimed she formed her view after considering how police had written to her and said @entity4 had taken them on ' drive rounds ' and cleared up 49 unsolved burglaries			2
police also confirmed remorseful @entity4 had been doing well in his fight to get off drugs before relapsing and had targeted homes he thought were unoccupied .			0
