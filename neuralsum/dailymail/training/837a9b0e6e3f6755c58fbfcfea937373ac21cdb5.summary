in time , this may be remembered as the day @entity1 were reborn			0
the gaal - acticos have found their mojo			2
it turned into a party , with 75,000 watching @entity1 move through the gears and give the fans what they want : goals , and lots of them			0
@entity1 settled on four , even though manager @entity11 was after more when he sent on @entity12 to join @entity13 and @entity14 in attack for the final 23 minutes			1
@entity14 , @entity16 and @entity17 celebrate as the mood improved around @entity19 @entity12 's arrival on the field was greeted with a rapturous reception by the home support ‘ @entity12 , @entity12 , give us a wave , ’ demanded the @entity24 when the forward arrived on the pitch and the @entity27 duly obliged			1
the build - up to his arrival on the field was momentous , with a whole stadium being swept along in the euphoria when @entity35 sent his latest recruit dashing down the touchline to warm up			2
this was like the old @entity1 as they piled forward in search of goals , flooding @entity42 ’s area and firing at will			0
@entity43 never stood a chance			1
@entity45 , because the @entity47 coach abandoned the disastrous three at the back and returned to the system @entity52 teams are most comfortable with			1
@entity53 looked assured as part of a back four on his @entity1 debut on sunday @entity56 marked himself out as a star of the future while @entity17 is already world class a flat back four feels and sounds antiquated , but at least @entity1 ’s defenders — @entity53 , @entity56 , @entity62 and @entity63 — knew what they were doing			1
@entity53 offered certainty , a composed figure alongside the improving and maturing @entity56			1
in time , @entity56 can be one of the best			1
that ’s the beauty of @entity35 , because he has brought through some of the best talents in the game , @entity72 and @entity73 among them			0
@entity56 is beginning to look the part			1
for all their eye - bulging spending over the past year , @entity1 and their fans know how to look after one of their own			2
sunday , in a run that stretches back to october 1937 , was the 3,705 successive match in which they have named a homegrown player in the matchday squad			2
it is early days for this new - look @entity1 , but this stadium responded to a team who played with purpose and pace			2
when you watch @entity17 contort his body to get past @entity91 and @entity92 , it is mesmerising			1
@entity17 scores his first @entity1 goal , and , whether deliberate or not , it was deserved the @entity95 winger was the stand - out performer in a superb @entity1 display @entity97 was replaced on 82 minutes , given a breather after 95 touches of the ball			1
many of them were jaw - dropping			2
when he influences a game in this fashion , it is easy to understand why @entity106 was so critical of the decision by @entity109 president @entity108 to sell the deep - lying winger			0
during the international break , @entity97 scored once and set up three in @entity95 ’s destruction of world champions @entity114 in @entity115			2
this was another bracing performance			0
he did n’t seem sure whether his free - kick was supposed to beat @entity43 ’s keeper , but there was no doubt about the touch that led to @entity125 ’s goal			1
it was a day for standing ovations , from the moment the team walked off at half - time when @entity1 were three goals to the good , to @entity97 ’s departure , to @entity12 ’s arrival on the field			0
the fans wanted goals and now they have them			0
‘ @entity14 , @entity14 , ’ they chanted when the captain drilled @entity1 ’s third goal from the edge of the area just before the break			0
the @entity19 fans were clearly excited to see their stars in the flesh and were pleased with what they saw @entity146 impressed on his @entity1 debut sitting in front of the back four @entity14 's goal made it 3 - 0 before half time and was well - received by the @entity19 faithful @entity1 supporters have retained a sense of humour , singing , ‘ we ’re going to win the league ’ , as the ball kept rippling the back of @entity42 ’s net			1
that seems a long way off , but @entity35 is up and running after an uncomfortable start			0
only a couple of weeks ago , when @entity1 were beaten 4 - 0 at @entity166 in the @entity167 , the aura surrounding him seemed to be to wearing off			0
after this tub - thumping win , the doubts have evaporated			0
@entity170 happy to get goals on board			0

@entity11 abandons disastrous three - man defence
back four looked secure in their roles and @entity56 could be a star
@entity17 touches the ball 95 times in his 82 - minute performance
@entity95 star shines in *midfield* *diamond* against @entity43
