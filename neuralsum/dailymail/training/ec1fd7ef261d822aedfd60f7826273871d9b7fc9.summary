by @entity0 , mail online deputy political editor school governors will have to demonstrate ' fundamental @entity4 values ' , under new rules set to be introduced in the wake of the trojan horse ' plot ' to radicalise school children			1
the education secretary @entity9 has also listed for the first time the set of ' @entity4 values ' which all schools must promote to combat extremism			1
under new @entity15 rules new academies and free schools must promote ' respect for the law , democracy , equality and tolerance of different faiths , religions and other beliefs '			1
mr @entity9 wants the government to take a harder line on @entity33 radicals , but mrs may fears this could drive school children into the hands of the jihadis but one @entity33 group said some conservative @entity39 could effectively end up being be barred from becoming school governors by the measures			2
the @entity42 said the proposals were ' frankly speaking , quite dangerous '			1
@entity44 , a senior member of the @entity42 , said : ' people may have different views , and those views might be informed by faith			2
' but does that mean the secretary of state should have the power to arbitrate these ideas , so much so that they should not be part of an educational establishment ? ' ministers insist the move is necessary in wake of a damning @entity60 report which claimed children in six @entity63 schools were at risk of radicalisation			2
school inspectors found hardline @entity33 governors led an ' organised campaign ' to change the character of ordinary state schools			0
the @entity71 and @entity72 were both branded ' inadequate ' by @entity60 inspectors investigating allegations of a ' trojan horse ' plot to radicalise pupils governors at @entity79 were accused of ' refusing to accept that the school is in a state of crisis ' while governors at @entity83 used the school 's budget to subsidise a trip to @entity87 for only @entity33 staff and pupils			0
the education secretary , reacting to the findings , revealed how one school had played the @entity33 call to prayer over loudspeakers in the playground while another had invited a hate preacher to speak even though he had previously called for ' victory to the @entity39 in @entity99 '			0
mr @entity9 also attacked a school for banning @entity102 pupils from subsidised school trips to @entity87			0
the @entity9 's statement came after school inspectors @entity60 found a ' culture of fear and intimidation ' had developed in some schools in the city			1
@entity60 chief inspector sir @entity110 also warned that @entity111 had failed to support a number of schools in their efforts to protect pupils from the ' risks of radicalisation and extremism '			0
some headteachers told inspectors that there had been an organised campaign to target certain schools in the city to change their ' character and ethos ' , sir @entity9 said			2
@entity127 , the assistant principal of @entity63 's @entity128 which was placed in special measures over fears children were at risk of radicalisation , said many of the concerns over @entity33 extremists were ' plain old @entity135 ' he concluded : ' in several of the schools inspected , children are being badly prepared for life in modern @entity4			2
' following the revelations @entity139 said there had been a ' worrying ' failure to push @entity4 values in schools and society			1
he said he wanted all school pupils to be taught about the @entity147			0
the prime minister 's intervention came after teachers were told by the education secretary @entity9 that they must in future ' actively promote @entity4 values '			1
mr @entity139 said these values would include ' a belief in freedom , tolerance of others , accepting personal and social responsibility , respecting and upholding the rule of law '			0
the new rules , revealed in the @entity160 today , forcing schools to promote @entity4 values have been inserted into the funding agreement between academies or free schools and the government			1
the new wording will apply to all free schools and academies opening or schools converting to academy status			1
under the existing legal agreement the education secretary was only able to cut off a school 's funding if there had been ' a serious breakdown in the way the academy is managed or governed ' or if the government regarded a governor as ' not a suitable person '			0
but the department 's new rules allow ministers to close the school or dismiss its governors if they think any member of the academy trust is ' unsuitable ' - if they have done anything ' aimed at undermining the fundamental @entity4 values '			1
a @entity15 spokesman dismissed claims that the rules were a threat to @entity39			0
' there is absolutely no bar to @entity39 becoming school governors , ' the spokesman said			0
' we want a diverse range of people , of all faiths and none , to serve on governing bodies			0
' it is right that unsuitable people should not be able to become governors			0
' we are clear that any behaviour which undermines the fundamental @entity4 values of democracy , the rule of law , individual liberty , mutual respect and tolerance of those with different faiths and beliefs is incompatible with being a governor in a state - funded school in @entity219			1

@entity9 lists ' @entity4 values ' which all schools must promote
gives himself power to close new academies and free schools if they fail
@entity42 says proposals ' frankly speaking , quite dangerous '
