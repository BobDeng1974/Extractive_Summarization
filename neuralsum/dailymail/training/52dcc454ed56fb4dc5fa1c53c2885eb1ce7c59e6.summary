the @entity0 claimed that the sunday tabloid was to blame for giving @entity3 's parents false hope that their missing daughter was alive the launch of the @entity7 and the closure of the @entity9 stemmed from one incendiary allegation which shocked the nation – and turned out to be untrue			1
the @entity0 claimed that the sunday tabloid was to blame for giving @entity3 ’s parents false hope that their missing daughter was alive			1
in a front page story , the newspaper accused the @entity9 of hacking into the schoolgirl ’s messages and deliberately erasing them in the cynical hope that clearing space for newer messages would give them fresh information for stories about the 13 - year - old ’s disappearance			1
this , it was said , led her parents to believe she had cleared her voicemail herself and so must be alive			1
the claim in july 2011 catapulted the phone hacking row into a national scandal , and so great was the outrage that the 168 - year - old @entity9 was closed four days later with the loss of hundreds of jobs			0
the allegation was also a crucial factor in @entity36 ’s decision to order the @entity7			2
but five months later , the @entity0 ’s story was shown to be untrue			2
while the @entity9 did listen to the schoolgirl ’s voicemail , police said there was no evidence that it deleted any messages			1
instead , investigators now believe the messages were erased automatically by the mobile phone provider			1
the @entity0 eventually issued a rather cursory 157 - word correction on page 32 of the newspaper , in which it conceded : ‘ the [ @entity9 ] is unlikely to have been responsible for the deletion of a set of voicemails from the phone that caused her parents to have false hopes that she was alive			1
’ phone hacking trial judge mr @entity57 said the tabloid was not responsible for giving @entity57 and mrs @entity60 false hope , adding : ‘ they , the @entity0 , were wrong and they have accepted it			1
’ the newspaper accused the @entity9 of hacking into the schoolgirl 's messages and deliberately erasing to clear space for newer messages			2
this , it was said , led her parents ( pictured ) to believe she had cleared her voicemail herself and so must be alive anti-corruption police investigated how the @entity0 got the information for their story and arrested an officer , @entity73 , on suspicion of conspiracy to commit misconduct			1
journalist @entity76 , one of the authors of the @entity0 front page story , was interviewed under caution			0
police suspected @entity81 – the ‘ interview strategy designer ’ for @entity82 – had leaked information and found a mass of telephone contact between him and @entity87 , but no evidence of payments being given			2
@entity91 's body was found six months after her disappearance			0
bouncer @entity93 is serving a life sentence for her murder det supt @entity96 , from @entity98 ’s anti-corruption command , said : ‘ @entity99 was informing @entity76 around when arrests were to take place , who they were			0
we could find no evidence of financial inducement , which was the main reason why the @entity106 decided not to press charges			0
’ the decision not to charge @entity99 , 53 , and @entity87 , 39 , was attacked as ‘ double standards ’ by a defence lawyer for @entity111 , who is accused of paying police for information			0
@entity114 appeared to suggest the officer had passed information to the journalist because they were in a relationship			0
he told the jury : ‘ let ’s assume no money changed hands because they were in a relationship … is it all right if it ’s done within a relationship but not if it ’s for money ? mr @entity126 was reminded by the judge that there was no evidence in the trial of a relationship between @entity87 and @entity81 , who has since retired from the police			1
miss @entity87 said the decision to investigate her was ‘ completely disproportionate … and a sinister attempt to chill public interest journalism ’ and defended the work of the @entity0 in exposing phone hacking			0
@entity91 went missing as she walked home from school in @entity141 , @entity142 , in march 2002			0
her voicemail inbox quickly filled up so that no more messages could be left			2
days later , when her mother @entity145 was suddenly able to get through again , she told the @entity7 she shouted out in elation : ‘ she ’s picked up her voicemail – she ’s alive			2
’ @entity91 ’s body was found six months after her disappearance			0
bouncer @entity93 is serving a life sentence for her murder .			0
