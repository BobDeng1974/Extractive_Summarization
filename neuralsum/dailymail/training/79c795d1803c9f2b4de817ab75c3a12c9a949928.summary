a holiday company is targeting a very specific market after launching breaks ideally suited for swingers and nudists			1
perhaps taking inspiration from the cult following amassed for the @entity9 phenomenon , intimate places are hoping to provide a ' judgement free holiday for open - minded and adventurous adults , couples and singles searching for a fun - filled , wildly expressive experience			1
' and there 's nothing ' seedy ' about these holidays , they are aimed at offering luxury resorts around the world			1
desire resorts have two bases in @entity22 , with both catering for swingers and adults who want to ' experiment ' guests can relax and take advantage of a ' clothing optional ' policy on ' @entity5 ' holidays going into a travel agency and booking a holiday that can enhance your fantasies , is probably not the most comfortable of conversations to drum up			1
so @entity36 - based company @entity5 decided to provide a service to help people escape from ' the routine , the confines and the limitations ' of ' normal ' life			1
speaking to @entity43 , @entity44 , owner of @entity5 , said : ' we are no different to any other all - inclusive holiday , except we offer different extra-curricular activities			1
' we noticed that if people wanted to book these kind of trips , they would have to book the hotel , then the flights , and then any activities separate			2
@entity56 - @entity55 @entity58 - @entity57 , @entity22 @entity59 - @entity57 , @entity22 @entity60 , @entity61 @entity62 - @entity22 @entity63 @entity64 , @entity65 @entity67 - @entity66 @entity69 - @entity68 , @entity22 ' by us offering our customers a package holiday , we ensure they are , pardon the pun , fully protected through @entity74			1
' we have holidays all around the world , but we are going to have a real look into developing our @entity79 offerings			2
' i do n't think we are any different to a mainstream holiday			2
' @entity82 admitted to believing the furore over the release of @entity9 may have contributed to an increased interest in his company 's offerings			0
' the website crashed last night , and we are just trying to get everything up and running again , ' he added			0
' we have already had more enquiries than we would expect ; but i think we are simply facilitating something that is already there			0
' there are adults - only cruises to select from , many of which run a ' clothing optional ' policy			1
the website describes these cruises as perfect for ' adventurous couples who want to explore different cultures and countries with freedoms unlike any other cruise			1
' these are the perfect opportunity to either relax and be at one with your partner , or for those who wish to ' spice things up , ' there will be plenty of opportunity to meet with like - minded adults who are keen to explore new ' sexual horizons			0
' the resorts and locations used for intimate places ' holiday are luxurious and expansive the @entity62 in @entity22 as been specially designed for naturists , from its size down to the secluded location of the eight resorts available to guests , @entity126 in @entity61 provides the greatest scope for engagement for customers			1

the majority of guests come from @entity65 and it is one of few hotels that also takes singles			0

the @entity67 in @entity66 has an outdoor jacuzzi that can hold 50 people , making it the ideal spot for couple to meet others			0
there is also the @entity156 - the most erotic part of the hotel , and the ideal place for couples to meet other couples			2
