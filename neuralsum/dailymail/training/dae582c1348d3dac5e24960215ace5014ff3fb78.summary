by @entity0 @entity1 : 12:26 est , 10 december 2013 @entity2 : 14:54 est , 10 december 2013 a comet - chasing probe is set to be woken from its deep space slumber early next year , the @entity3 has said			2
at precisely 10 am gmt on 20 january , the @entity8 spacecraft be brought back to life as it moves closer towards @entity10			1
when @entity13 's @entity8 spacecraft wakes , scientists are hoping it will be ready for the final stage of its daring mission to land on the comet			1
after it is woken from its slumber , the spacecraft will be involved a high - speed chase followed by a delicate dance around comet @entity35			2
it will then attempt a historic landing in november 2014 the intercepting a 4km wide comet as it hurtles towards the sun. ‘ imagine trying to parachute onto the tip of a mountain , ’ said @entity41 , head of mission operations at the @entity3 ( @entity3 )			1
the effort is different from @entity48 ’s @entity47 probe that fired a projectile into comet @entity50 in 2005 , hurling a plume of matter into space for scientists to study			2
for the coldest , loneliest leg of the mission , as @entity8 travelled out towards the orbit of @entity57 , the spacecraft was put into deep - space hibernation @entity8 was launched in 2004 and has since travelled around the sun five times , picking up energy from @entity64 and @entity65 to line it up with its final destination : @entity67 – @entity68			1
for the coldest , loneliest leg of the mission , as @entity8 travelled out towards the orbit of @entity57 , the spacecraft was put into deep - space hibernation			1
in 2014 , @entity8 will complete its cruise towards the comet , meeting with it in august , before putting its @entity75 lander onto the comet ’s surface in november			1
the time for @entity8 to wake up and prepare for this most exciting scientific adventure is now fast approaching			2
that mission was more of a sniper shot compared to the extended meeting @entity3 is planning for its spacecraft			2
launched in 2004 , @entity8 has already spent almost 10 years in space preparing for its big day			1
the probe had to conduct three fly - bys of @entity64 and one of @entity65 , taking advantage of the planets ' gravity to accelerate sufficiently to intercept comet @entity92 as it orbits the sun at speeds of up to 100,000 kph ( 62,000 mph )			1
the spacecraft has been in hibernation for more than two years now to conserve energy			0
@entity3 has been using the time to solve two glitches that could jeopardise the mission : a problem with two of the four ` reaction wheels ' used to turn the spacecraft , and a small leak of helium that could affect the thrusters which are vital for its final manoeuvres			0
‘ this is making our life more difficult , ’ dr @entity41 acknowledges			0
but he added that engineers have found workarounds			0
if all goes according to plan , the probe 's instruments will slowly switch themselves back on , though scientists will have a tense few hours of waiting before they can be sure the spacecraft is in full working order			0
the following months will involve a gradual approach of @entity123 , as @entity8 gently slows down and eventually draws up alongside the comet in what dr @entity41 likened to two planes flying in formation			1
after it is woken from its slumber , the spacecraft will be involved a high - speed chase followed by a delicate dance around comet @entity35			0
pictured is an artist 's impression of the comet this will give the mission team time to take plenty of pictures of the comet , which is about 4km ( 2.5 miles ) in diameter , and identify a good landing site			2
at the moment scientists are divided over whether to pick a site close to the comet 's three active regions - where matter appears to be released into space - or to stay away from them to prevent dust from harming the lander 's sensitive instruments			0
the lander - called @entity75 - will drop onto the surface of @entity123 and latch on using a harpoon , to prevent it from drifting off into space due to the comet 's weak gravity			0
using drills , it will dig up samples and analyse them using on - board instruments			0
researchers hope to gain fascinating insights from the results , because comets have remained largely unchanged since the beginning of the universe			0
‘ this time capsule 's been locked away for 4.6 billion years , ’ said @entity3 's director of science @entity170			0
one key question scientists hope the mission can help answer is whether comets are responsible for the water on @entity64 , he said .			1

@entity8 will be brought back to life on january 20 at 10am gmt
it launched in 2004 and has since travelled around the sun five times
in november it will land on comet @entity67 – @entity68
mission could help answer whether comets brought water to @entity64
