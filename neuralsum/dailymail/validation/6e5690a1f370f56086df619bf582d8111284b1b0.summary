a walkway that was once declared the most dangerous footpath in the world has become one of the most popular tourist attractions on the planet after it was made safer by @entity7 authorities			1
tourists have already snapped up the initial batch of tickets to walk along the wooden walkways and stone paths at the revamped @entity13 , which slices through the @entity14 in southern @entity7			1
true thrill - seekers may be disappointed , however , as the reinforced @entity17 ’s @entity16 , as it is known in @entity18 , is now more of a beauty spot than a danger zone after a £ 4million ( € 5.5million ) restoration project			1
tourists have been quick to obtain the free tickets , with up to 600 people admitted per day			1
a four - mile network of paths is open six days a week , weather permitting , and it is estimated that it will take the average visitors four to five hours to walk the full route			0

situated nearly 330ft above the @entity56 river , the narrow concrete path , supported by steel stanchions at around 45 degrees into the rock face , had wide gaps and rickety hand rails that posed a massive challenge for even experienced climbers			0

for years locals and tourists bypassed security measures and ignored the threat of a £ 5,000 fine for trespassing			0
that was until the @entity93 and @entity94 governments launched the ambitious restoration project			2
accessible from the towns of @entity98 and @entity99 ( @entity100 ) , the footpath is more than 100 years old and was built for workers at two nearby hydroelectric plants			0
