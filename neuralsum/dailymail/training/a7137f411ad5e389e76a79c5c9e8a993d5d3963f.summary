the sky was blue and sunny but a grey and doleful air gripped the paddock even as @entity4 was tearing to pole position for sunday ’s @entity7 @entity6			1
his reward should he win would be a handshake with @entity11 if , as is rumoured , the president of the @entity7 presents the victor ’s trophy in this glittering steel and tarmac symbol of his own virility			1
but it is not the dubious politics of shadowy former @entity22 states that accounted for the melancholic mood here on saturday			2
that was summed up by the legend across the track : ‘ @entity29 we are all supporting you ’			2
his condition 5,000 miles away shook the usual narrow focus of the 21 other members of the @entity46 drivers ’ fraternity , men whose craft demands total self - absorption			1
‘ it ’s something i ’m trying my hardest not to think too much about , ’ said @entity4 of @entity66 ’s predicament , after beating @entity35 into second place in qualifying			1
‘ we all know it ’s tough for everyone here			2
getting into the car this weekend has been the weirdest and one of the most difficult in my racing career			2
but we need to keep the pedal down and keep going			2
i hope we have a strong , positive race and that everyone is safe			0
’ they were honest words from a driver who has never recoiled from danger at the wheel			0
@entity4 was in imperious form at the @entity99 as he claimed pole position @entity35 will hope to get the better of his @entity102 team - mate at @entity99 on sunday @entity103 driver @entity34 ( left ) made errors in the final sector to finish behind @entity4 and @entity35 the demeanour of the three fastest qualifiers — @entity4 , @entity35 and @entity34 — was a little quieter than normal			1
there was no fist - pumping celebration or hollering down the radio			1
these were genuine manifestations of a deep but almost suppressed anxiety			0
@entity4 , driving as though unfazed , has been the master of the new @entity99 — 3.6 miles with 19 bends — since he first drove on it during practice on friday			1
his margin of two - tenths of a second over @entity35 was emphatic enough , though @entity103 ’s @entity34 may have prised pole for himself but for veering wide as he strained at the final couple of corners			1
it was @entity4 ’s seventh pole of the season and maintained the momentum that has carried him to three consecutive victories			1
@entity47 drove impressively to fourth , his best qualifying performance since the @entity42 @entity6 in july			1
@entity128 ’s @entity7 @entity48 was fifth , somehow saving the best qualifying performance of his life for his home audience			1
however , the main grandstand was half - empty , though other parts of the stadium looked pretty full			2
mailonline will be covering every twist and turn from the @entity138 live on sunday @entity4 set the pace on saturday - he is bidding to claim his fourth win on the spin the 29 - year - old is chasing a fourth consecutive win after claiming victory in @entity145 , @entity146 and @entity70 the other home representation in the race comes in the form of @entity66 ’s @entity67 team			1
they are based in @entity152 , @entity153 but are owned by @entity154 , a businessman just short of oligarch status			0
out of respect to @entity66 , his team ran just one car , driven by @entity159 @entity64			1
alas , he finished last			2
but through the pall , he said : ‘ it has been a difficult weekend for us all , so all in all we ’ve done well			0
with the whole team around me we can try to do the best we can for @entity29			0
’ victory for @entity4 , who leads @entity35 by 10 points with three rounds remaining after sunday , would take him closer to a second world title and provide the highlight of a wonderful weekend here for @entity42 drivers			1
for as @entity4 did his debriefs , @entity173 , son of @entity175 driver dr @entity174 , was celebrating winning the @entity177 race and series			1
@entity47 will start fourth in his @entity179 , the @entity159 's second best grid slot of the campaign he became the first @entity42 winner of @entity46 ’s feeder series since @entity4 in 2006			1
aged 23 , he is looking for a race in the top echelon but , heavens , it will be hard because the lesser teams are looking for drivers to pay them huge sums to land a race seat			0
@entity192 was in tears as he looked up at the podium with @entity195 ringing out			0
‘ we know it will be hard to get into @entity46 but @entity173 has done a fantastic job this season , ’ he said			0
‘ we are speaking to a few people but are realistic			0
we are keeping our fingers crossed			0
’ earlier , another @entity159 , with an astonishing story of courage , won the @entity205 race			1
@entity206 , who has recently recovered from cancer , lost his drive with @entity205 team when they decided not to race in @entity99 for ‘ commercial reasons ’			0
he hitched a race with @entity214 team @entity212 — and won			0
@entity173 became the first @entity159 to win the @entity177 title since @entity4 in 2006 home hope @entity48 secured the best position of his fledgling career with fifth in his @entity128 @entity54 had a very disappointing day and finished 11th in qualifying for the @entity7 @entity6 before the inaugural @entity7 @entity6 starts , all eyes will be on @entity11 and his guards			1
he loves projecting his all - action image			2
here at the @entity222 in february he was at every major event from the opening and closing ceremonies to the ice hockey and even to the bedside of stricken skier @entity228 , where she woke up to find him wearing a white coat			0
but there is a catch now			0
given the sanctions imposed by the @entity242 after the crisis in @entity244 , the seizure of @entity235 and the downing of a @entity238 airliner near @entity239 , @entity11 and his cronies are less keen to be seen enjoying themselves			0
a sense of ill - will towards him was displayed at the @entity249 match in @entity250 between @entity251 and @entity244 this week			2
fans of both sides sang an insulting song about @entity11			0
eight were jailed , others convicted and fined			0
will such elements find their way into the stands here ? a tight security operation — armed guards , cossack warriors , scanning machines — says they wo n’t .			0

@entity4 took pole position at the @entity7 @entity6
@entity35 finished second ahead of third - placed @entity34
