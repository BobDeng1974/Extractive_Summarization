a former @entity1 jail officer who was arrested on suspicion of killing his wife three years after police ruled it a suicide insisted that scratches on his chest after her death were from shaving			1
but the marks across @entity14 ' chest - and the fact his dna was found under his wife 's nails - suggest that the couple had been in a struggle before he shot her , @entity10 reported			1
the new evidence has emerged in the report by journalist @entity22 , whose damning reports about the case led to police agreeing to reopen the investigation in april last year			0
in november , @entity14 was arrested on suspicion of killing his wife , @entity27 , in january 2012			2

@entity14 , who was working as a @entity44 corrections officer , called 911 in screaming hysterics to say his wife had committed suicide			2
he angrily denied that he had anything to do with his wife 's death and @entity50 police quickly ruled that @entity27 had died of a self - inflicted gunshot wound			1

arrest : after pressure from @entity27 ' parents , @entity14 , pictured , was arrested in november @entity27 ' nails were also swabbed - and sources told the station that those swabs tested positive for her husband 's dna , ' calling into question whether @entity14 lied that night ' , @entity22 reported			1
but the dna and scratches are not the only pieces of evidence that raise questions			0
among the details that @entity10 uncovered : a friend at the party who said he overheard @entity27 crying for her husband to get off of her ; a neighbor who said he heard outside his window as @entity14 confess to killing his wife ; reports from @entity27 's parents that he had been violently angry before @entity27 's death ; clear evidence of a struggle in the bedroom where @entity27 's body was found			1
most shockingly , one of the the @entity127 ' young children , age six , told police that she saw ' daddy getting the gun ready ' and ' saw daddy shoot mommy ' / ' he was irate and explosive			2

but in the interview , @entity14 insisted that he never argued with his wife			0
after he claimed the scratches were not from @entity27 , the detective asked : ' why would she tell you to get off of her then ? ' ' i was never on her , ' he responded			0
determined : @entity27 's mother , @entity135 , who has fought for justice , called the new dna evidence ' powerful ' scene : a photo shows the @entity127 ' bedroom at their home in @entity50 , @entity1 where @entity27 was found dead and in a bizarre twist , he claimed he found two alleged suicide notes from @entity27 late last year - nearly three years after her death			1
@entity27 's mother , @entity135 , told @entity10 that it 's ' suspect ' that he 's only just come forward with the notes			1
' if anything they are probably notes from @entity27 discussing her struggle as a wife and not her alleged intention to kill herself , ' she said			0
in november , he was arrested in @entity162 , @entity163 , where he had been living with the couple 's three young children after fleeing @entity1			0
he was extradited back to @entity1			0
he has always maintained his innocence			0
the children were handed over to @entity27 's parents , @entity135 and @entity169			1
the couple had never gave up their search for justice			0
they rallied friends and supporters to picket outside the police station when @entity27 's death was ruled a suicide			2

@entity27 , a 28 - year - old mother of three , was found shot in the back of the head in her @entity50 , @entity1 home on @entity29 2012
her husband @entity14 , a jail officer , said she shot herself and her death was quickly ruled a suicide by the @entity189
but @entity27 's parents say local cops covered up for him
an investigation by @entity10 found that cops left out details of her death , *including* how their *daughter* , 6 , said she ' saw daddy shoot mommy '
new evidence shows that @entity27 had her husband 's dna under her *fingernails* and that he had scratches on his neck and chest
but in an interview after her death , he said the scratches were from his skin being irritated by shaving
