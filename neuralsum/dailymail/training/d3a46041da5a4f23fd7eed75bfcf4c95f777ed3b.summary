the 51 - year - old , who fronted the @entity4 with @entity2 from 1994 to 2006 , told radio show host @entity5 that ' every man in @entity8 ' was attracted to his then co-anchor , 56 , who he described as a ' 9 or 10 ' physically			1
the star added that @entity2 's ' great personality ' boosted her to a ' 14 '			0
' attractive ' : ' every man in @entity8 ' found her attractive , @entity1 ( seen with his former @entity4 co-host in 2006 ) said of @entity2 ' fun ' : @entity2 , seen during her own interview with @entity5 last month , co-hosted the @entity4 with @entity1 from 1994 to 2006 ' she 's a very attractive woman , not only physically , but her personality , ' @entity1 said on @entity5 's show			1
' if she 's a 9 or 10 physically , she 's a 14 because ... she 's got a great personality			1
' ' we had a good and easy chemistry , ' he explained , according to a report in the @entity23			0
last month @entity2 , now at @entity24 , revealed to stern she too had a ' little crush ' on @entity1 in the days when he was a local news anchor			2
' i thought he was so funny , and so quick , ' she said			0
despite the apparent mutual attraction , both @entity1 and @entity2 insist they were never romantically involved			2
of @entity2 's replacement @entity32 , who retired in 2011 , @entity1 said : ' she was beloved by everyone on staff			2
' but @entity5 said he ran out of time before he could ask the news anchor 's opinion on ousted @entity4 host @entity38			2
former ' family ' : @entity2 and @entity1 co-anchored while @entity38 ( right ) was a co-host during the late 1990s chemistry and lack thereof : @entity2 and @entity1 got along great ( left in 1997 ) , while @entity1 and @entity38 struggled ( right in 2012 before she was fired ) @entity2 recently revealed that she was approached about coming back to her old @entity4 stomping ground as part of a plan to replace @entity38			1
she talked about how @entity1 discussed various programming options with her during @entity47 's tumultuous ratings last spring , including one where the former co-anchors would head up a daytime talk show as well as lead the morning news			0
' @entity1 and i had talked about possibly teaming up and doing a show at some point and there were some cautious overtures to me to possibly come back to the ' today ' show , but they evaporated , ' she told @entity5 last month			1
the reported backroom talks about the possible anchor switch came when @entity2 's contract with @entity60 was about to end which coincided with the @entity4 's loss of their 16 - year ratings winning streak against competitor @entity65			0
it has been previously reported that @entity1 reached out to @entity2 and encouraged her to come back and replace @entity38 , but the interview with @entity5 served as the first time that any of the principals involved confirmed the move			1

' for me , that was the best job , ' she told @entity5			2
@entity2 sat at the @entity4 anchor desk from 1991 to 2006 , much of that time spent next to @entity1 who has been on the morning show since 1997			1
in many of the reports of what really happened inside @entity47 when @entity38 was pushed out of her spot as co-anchor after only a year , @entity1 was seen as the bad guy , the driving force behind @entity38 's quick turn - around			0
in @entity2 's eyes , however , he is just a good friend who she used to have a crush on			0
@entity5 questioned her about whether she and @entity1 ever had a romantic relationship - which she has denied many times - though she did admit to finding him attractive before they worked together			0
' you know what , i actually had a little crush on matt when he was the local news anchor at @entity100 because he was so funny and so quick , ' she said			0
now the dust is beginning to settle from last year 's multi-network game of anchor musical chairs as @entity2 headlines her own daytime talk show on @entity24 and @entity1 remains at the helm of the @entity4 alongside his new co-anchor , @entity107 .			1

@entity1 and @entity2 fronted the @entity4 together for 12 years
