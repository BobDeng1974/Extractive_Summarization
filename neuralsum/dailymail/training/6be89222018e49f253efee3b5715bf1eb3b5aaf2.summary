she is the fierce @entity1 boss known only by the @entity2 but now the true identity of @entity5 ’s mentor has finally been revealed – after a bit of sleuthing of which 007 himself would have been proud			2
an eagle - eyed fan managed to freeze - frame a single camera shot in @entity10 lasting just a split - second and discovered that @entity13 ’s real name is @entity14			1
@entity15 - eyed : the true identity of @entity5 's mentor has emerged			1
@entity13 ’s real name is @entity14			1
she is currently played by @entity17 , right , with @entity18 , left , playing @entity5 during the scene , @entity5 , played by @entity18 , is handed a box containing a @entity22 bulldog draped in a @entity24 flag , which is usually kept on @entity13 ’s desk			1
zooming in on the box ’s inscription , the words ‘ from the estate of @entity28 to @entity5 ’ are visible			0
since the revelation by blogger @entity33 , internet forums have been filled with speculation about the significance of the name			0
one theory is that it is a tribute to @entity38 , the first head of @entity1 who started the tradition of the organisation ’s director signing letters with a single letter – in his case @entity38 @entity46 : when @entity5 is given @entity13 's china bulldog after her death in @entity10 , @entity13 's real name is shown on the box others have speculated it is a portmanteau of ‘ man ’s field ’ , alluding to the fact that @entity13 works in a male - dominated industry			1
@entity57 , archive director for @entity5 production company @entity58 , said : ‘ we ’ve searched around and as far as we can see this is the first and only time anyone ’s ever revealed @entity13 ’s real name			1
‘ it may not have been spoken , but if you were watching on a big enough screen it could have been visible , so we ’d argue it ’s now canon			0
’ since dame @entity17 became the franchise ’s first female spymaster in 1995 , producers have dropped a series of hints about the character ’s name			0
stars : @entity18 as @entity5 , left , and @entity17 as @entity1 head @entity13 are pictured in a scene from the latest @entity5 film @entity10 in 2006 ’s @entity78 , @entity18 ’s 007 tells his boss : ‘ i thought @entity13 was a randomly assigned letter			2
i had no idea it stood for			0
’ to which she interjects : ‘ @entity84 more syllable and i ’ll have you killed			0
’ and in @entity10 , @entity87 the groundskeeper refers to her as @entity88 , although many fans believe this is because he believes @entity5 to be calling her ‘ @entity91 ’ .			2
