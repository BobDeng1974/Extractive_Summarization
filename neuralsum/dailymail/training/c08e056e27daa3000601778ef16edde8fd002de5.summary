by @entity0 published : 04:51 est , 21 december 2012 updated : 06:32 est , 21 december 2012 ' @entity2 hoax ' : @entity3 , a senior scientist and astrobiologist at @entity6 's @entity5 , appears in the short film to dispel doomsday rumours @entity6 tried to calm fears that doomsday is due at some point today with the release of a second video of a senior scientist dispelling the various rumours of impending apocalypse			1
there are fears that the end of the @entity19 , which some experts say comes today , signals the @entity21			0
@entity3 , a senior scientist and astrobiologist at @entity6 's @entity5 , appears in the short film to reiterate the agency 's belief that the rumours are just a ' big hoax '			1
it is the second video this month @entity6 has released in an effort to calm fears , after it was accused of tempting fate by releasing a film dubbed why @entity31 did n't end yesterday - ten days early			1
however , that @entity6 has seen fit to ask one of its most esteemed and learned scientists to answer the rumours shows the agency is taking seriously the possibility of mass panic			1
dr @entity3 says : ' @entity6 has received thousands of emails and calls from members of the public who are concerned , especially young people , so it seems only right that @entity6 scientists should help to dispel these rumours			1
' chief among the rumours spinning across the internet is that the end of the world has been predicted by the @entity19 , which apparently completes its cycle today			2
' that 's simply not true , ' dr @entity3 says			2
' that 's a modern rumour , it has nothing to do with the real @entity53			0
' coming to an end today : the mayan long count calendar astronomical and planetary experts from the @entity58 space agency explained away all the myths surrounding the end of the mayan calender - particularly that a rogue planet was due to hit the @entity63 another widely held fear is that a rogue planet known as @entity66 or @entity67 is headed for a collision course with @entity63 , and that the impact will completely wipe out human civilisation and , probably , everything else			1
dr @entity3 calls the rumour ' silly ' pointing out that if such a planet were on headed for an impact with our own world ' anyone could see it '			2
' it would be one of the brightest things in the sky , ' he adds			0
less apocalyptic , but still catastrophic , are the fears that the @entity63 's rotation is set to change and the poles will flip , doing massive damage to our habitats and civilisation			0
but dr @entity3 says ' this just ca n't happen ' , adding that there is ' no way ' the @entity63 's poles could flip			1
the video from @entity6 makes the point that if a rogue planet or asteroid was about to hit the @entity63 we would already be able to see it with our bare eyes @entity100 believed that a 5,125 - year cycle known as the long count would come to a close on december 21 2012			2
experts estimate the system , which is made up of 394 - year periods called baktuns , started counting at 3114 @entity108 , and will have run through 13 baktuns , or 5,125 years , around december 21			0
they say 13 was a significant number for the @entity53 , and the end of that cycle would be a milestone â€” but they have been keen to stress that it does not mark an end			0
conspiracy theorists nonetheless believe the @entity53 may have been privy to impending astronomical disasters that would coincide with 2012 , ranging from explosive storms on the surface of the sun that could knock out power grids to a galactic alignment that could trigger a reversal in @entity63 's magnetic field			0
he goes on to discount rumours that a planetary alignment will occur , since the planets are currently ' all over the sky ' , and we are set to be gobbled up by a massive black hole , which , he says , astronomers know is ' impossible '			0
to those whose fears have been exacerbated by the belief that the number of natural disasters is increasing across the planet , dr @entity3 says ' the frequency of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions is not greater now than any time in the past			0
' he also dispels a more recent internet rumour that @entity6 has confirmed that there will be three days of total darkness beginning from tomorrow			2
' @entity6 did n't say that , nobody said it , ' he says			2
' it 's just one more crazy idea			0
' the video was published on tuesday , just five days after the agency indicated it was so confident the apocalypse was going to happen today it released a video entitled why @entity31 did n't end yesterday			1
like dr @entity3 's video , it outlined point by point the myths surrounding the end of the @entity159 calendar with astronomical and planetary experts answering them			1
' if you are watching this video then that means one thing ... the world did n't end yesterday , ' began the prematurely released video			1
the end - of - days prophesy is based on an interpretation of the ancient @entity159 calendar which claims the world will end on december 21 2012 .			0

last week space agency accused of tempting fate after releasing why @entity31 did n't end yesterday film ten days early
@entity6 says it has received thousands of calls and emails from concerned *citizens* asking for *information* about apocalypse rumours
senior space agency scientist @entity3 says the rumours are just a ' big hoax ' and there 's nothing to be worried about
