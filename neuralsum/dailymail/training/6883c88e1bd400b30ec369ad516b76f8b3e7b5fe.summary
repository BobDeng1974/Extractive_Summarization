by @entity1 reporter published : 06:56 est , 27 april 2012 updated : 14:46 est , 27 april 2012 you can see how it might cause confusion			2
faced with the choice of just two candidates in a local election , many voters would plump for the name of the sitting councillor			2
but the electorate in the @entity13 ward in @entity14 , @entity15 , will need to be a little more careful than they might have expected			1
the @entity16 have selected a candidate who not only bears a passing resemblance to @entity20 councillor @entity19 ... he shares exactly the same name as well			1
spot the difference : @entity20 councillor @entity19 , left , says conservatives are trying to confuse voters by putting up @entity19 , right , in the two - horse race near @entity26 the @entity20 group has accused its political rival of using ' dirty tricks ' to try to unseat their @entity19			1
the 60 - year - old candidate , who has been a councillor since 2004 , said : ' this is clearly a stunt by the conservative party to subvert the democratic process			0
' they just want to confuse the voters by putting someone with the same name as me on the ballot paper â€“ it 's just dirty tricks to try to sabotage the election			0
' the other @entity19 has n't been campaigning at all			1
' he has n't handed out any leaflets , there are no posters and he has n't knocked on a single door			0
the @entity16 are trying to defraud and confuse voters			0
' the @entity19 , who is ten years older than his namesake , remained tight - lipped about his candidacy yesterday			2
odd couple : labour candidate @entity19 , who lives half a mile from his rival , is wearing a t - shirt to make sure there is less confusion on may 3 battle : the pair are fighting for voters to get them a place on @entity60 from next thursday but the leader of the conservatives on @entity60 , @entity63 , was quick to deny his party had done anything wrong			1
he said : ' these accusations are total nonsense			0
' our @entity19 lives in the area and has been a member of our party for ages			2
@entity20 is just clutching at straws			1
' but some local residents remained sceptical			0
@entity75 , 70 , said : ' it 's easy for us older people to get a bit flustered in the ballot box			0
' with two people of the same name presented to you many people will be getting confused			0
' @entity85 , 35 , added : ' if you choose the first @entity19 you see , you might vote for the wrong person			1

flustered locals in @entity14 near @entity26 fear the confusion could cause them to vote for the wrong candidate
both live half a mile apart and voters say they look alike too
tories say @entity20 are ' clutching at straws ' because they fear their @entity19 will *win*
