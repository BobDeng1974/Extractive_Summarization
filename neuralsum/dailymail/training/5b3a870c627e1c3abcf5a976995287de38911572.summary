even the window display is the same with underwear , shirts and ties still neatly stored in their place			0
the short socks demonstrate how the price of clothing has risen , with the store 's 65 per cent cotton pairs costing just £ 1.99 or £ 5.50 for three pairs			2
there are ties for all occasions hanging from pastel - coloured shirts , as well as gloves and hats hap - hazardously strewn on the white - tiled walls			0
family business : @entity4 took over the store when his father @entity47 died in 1969 retro : the shirt and tie collection at the store in @entity6 , @entity7 , is dominated by light , pastel colours giving an insight into the fashion of the day height of fashion : an unusual display combo including a short - sleeved shirt , patterned jumper and thick gloves and there is also the odd item of women 's clothing with a retro jumper costing £ 13.95 and containing a tag warning customers it is the ' last one '			1

he said : ' my father wanted to take things a bit easier so i took over the shop and he just sort of pootled around when he felt like it and had a chat with some of the customers , which he liked to do in those days			0
' my father died and i just carried on with my mum up until about 10 or 12 years ago			1
' things were getting desperate and i was getting old so i just decided to call it a day and i closed down and that 's the way it 's been ever since			0
