heartbreaking new images taken inside a @entity2 refugee camp today show the young lives that have been torn apart by four weeks of fighting in the besieged @entity6 city of @entity7			1
having been forced to flee their hometown due to the threat posed by the @entity11 , thousands of desperate families crossed the border into southern @entity2 , where they will now be living in tents and basic shelters for the foreseeable future			1
despite the horrific rapes and massacres carried out by the terrorists attacking their home town , the children now living in the @entity18 refugee camp remain full of smiles , not yet fully aware of quite how lucky they and their families have been to avoid becoming victims of the extremist horde			1
his family was lucky enough to have fled the fighting in @entity7 before having to confront the @entity35 militants smiles : despite the massacres carried out by @entity35 terrorists in @entity7 , the children now living in the @entity18 refugee camp are not yet fully aware of how lucky they and their families have been to avoid becoming victims of the extremist horde a @entity6 refugee couple pass their child over a fence in @entity18 this morning			1

those able to do so fled to the @entity2 border where ethnic @entity53 on both sides of the crossing frantically cut down the barbed wire fencing that forms much of the incredibly porous 550 mile border between @entity2 and @entity6			1
not everybody was able to leave the city before @entity35 confronted them , however			2
reports from inside the city at the height of the siege last week told of decapitated bodies scattered around @entity7 's streets - of a savagery worse than anybody had dared to fear			2
refugees who made it to @entity18 tell of witnessing appalling horrors in hushed tones , as if they can barely believe it themselves			2
father - of - four @entity75 , 38 , said : ' i have seen tens , maybe hundreds , of bodies with their heads cut off			0
others with just their hands or legs missing			0
i have seen faces with their eyes or tongues cut out – i can never forget it for as long as i live			2
they put the heads on display to scare us all			0

mr @entity75 , a floor fitter from @entity7 , and his wife and children aged three to 12 , ran for their lives			2
' the children saw the headless people			0
they saw them , ' he said quietly , sitting cross-legged on a rug in his tent in the squalid refugee camp in @entity18			1
@entity119 , a farmer from a village near @entity7 , said his cousin , a 48 - year - old father of seven , stayed behind when the rest of the family fled			2
' we phoned my cousin and @entity127 answered his phone			0
they said , ' we 've got his head , and we 're taking it to @entity131 ( an @entity127 stronghold ) '			0
' he added : ' an @entity135 teacher in our village tried to reason with them , but they just called him a kaffir [ non-believer ] and tied him to their car and dragged him away			0
we heard they beheaded him later			0
' my neighbour was beheaded because they said he was ' delivering vegetables to the kaffir '			0
they burned his farm , livestock , even his bees – they destroyed everything			0

' they are @entity180 , they are @entity135 , they are from all over @entity178			0
we know because we can hear their accents , ' said mr @entity119			0
this morning fierce street battles broke out in @entity7 - the first significant fighting in the city since the majority of @entity35 ' militants were pushed back into the suburbs two days ago by the most intense coalition bombing raids of the past few weeks			1
the clashes came as desperate @entity35 jihadists launched a final assault ' on all fronts ' to take the town , after the militants felt the full force of @entity201 air power last night with sustained bombing raids resulting in a series of spectacular explosions in the besieged @entity6 town			1
the radical @entity207 group has been dramatically pushed back from the town in recent days , having as recently as last week looked like it was about to drive out the last of the brave @entity30 fighters defending it			0
as a fresh round of airstrikes rained down last night , the @entity201 also ran a series of airdrops for the @entity30 resistance , dispatching weapons and medical supplies			0
pyrotechnic tracer ammunition could be seen marking out @entity35 targets in the town as the @entity201 bombers flew overhead .			2
