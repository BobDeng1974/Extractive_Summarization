there are some results that you look at on paper and they are decent enough			0
a draw at @entity5 , a point at @entity7 and a 1 - 1 at @entity8 , given their fine run under @entity10 , are decent returns for a club with @entity14 ’s ambitions			1
defeat at @entity15 , when they were fully aware @entity5 had just beaten @entity17 at the @entity18 , is not			1
this , it has to be said , was an absolute mauling			0
@entity22 fumes as his @entity14 side slip to a 5 - 3 defeat at @entity25 on @entity26 @entity25 ’s bracing victory here will be remembered as the day the @entity30 title swung back in favour of the defending champions			1
the quicker we cut to the chase of january 31 , when @entity14 play @entity36 ’s team at @entity37 , the better			1
here at @entity15 we were supposed to witness the great recovery , the @entity14 backlash after the perceived injustice at @entity41 ’s last sunday			1
instead they are searching for answers to their increasingly perplexing form on the road after this defeat against @entity48 ’s improving @entity25 side			1
this dodgy little run of @entity14 ’s began on november 29 when they drew at @entity17 and were then beaten at @entity50 on december 6			1
@entity51 looks dejected after @entity14 concede their fourth goal at @entity15 here at @entity15 , just moments after @entity54 ’s penalty had rippled the back of @entity57 ’ net , @entity22 was heading for the tunnel			1
it is usually in these situations when he takes a moment to himself , deconstructing his team ’s performance before the grand , half - time speech to the players in the dressing room			2
he was entitled to be upset here , frustrated that his team allowed a one goal advantage to slide to such an extent that they were out of this game by half - time			0
by the 52nd minute , when @entity75 scored his second of the game , it was all over			0
so what has happened to them ? at @entity81 on december 22 they scored early as well , earning three points after @entity51 put them in front and @entity85 added the second			0
at the time their spirit looked unbreakable			0
it was a different story at @entity8 , where @entity22 showed his ruthless streak by taking off @entity91 at half - time as punishment for a poor performance			0
@entity22 embraces his opposite number @entity96 before the end of the match at @entity15 there was no sign of the @entity103 @entity102 winner , not even making the bench after that 1 - 1 draw at @entity41 ’s			1
this time it was @entity107 who made way , dragged off at the break and replaced by the muscular presence of @entity112			0
despite @entity22 ’s brilliance as a coach , he always has the potential to combust			0
the manner and the execution of the criticism levelled at referee @entity122 was unnecessary , even if he failed to award @entity85 a 55th minute penalty			0
although @entity22 had a point , it has distracted this @entity14 team from the main event			1
he lost it again here , repeatedly saying cursing at fourth official @entity130 when he felt decisions were going against this @entity14 team			2
@entity51 , @entity85 ( right ) and @entity132 all vie for the same ball with no @entity25 players in sight referee @entity136 had it in the neck too , berated form the sidelines as @entity22 grew increasingly animated in the technical area			2
@entity14 ’s manager has to sort this out because he , just like his defence , is in danger of losing his cool			2
@entity51 , who has been so reliable this season , and @entity146 are suddenly creaking as a central defensive partnership			0
@entity51 ’s unusual mistake at @entity8 , which led to the opening goal from @entity150			0
@entity75 was magnificent , scoring twice and winning the penalty that put @entity25 3 - 1 in the clear by half time			1
when the young @entity154 forward hit the target in the 52nd minute , you just knew it was going to be @entity25 ’s day .			2

@entity25 beat @entity14 5 - 3 at @entity15 on @entity26
@entity14 level on points with @entity5 at the top of the table
@entity14 have won just one of last five away matches in @entity30
