' i 'm from a part of @entity2 which historically speaking probably should n't be @entity3 at all			1
' my home town of @entity5 - in a corner of the @entity3 near where it borders @entity8 and @entity9 - strikes me as being much more @entity8 in character than @entity3 , in that fun - loving , hedonistic and unrestrained			1
' throughout history , lots of countries have fought to take possession of @entity5			1
the @entity16 @entity15 always seemed to be sending his army to seize it			2
it was very important to him			2
master musician : @entity3 composer @entity20 may travel the world , but he insists he prefers @entity5 @entity20 's home town may be in the @entity3 , but it borders @entity8 and @entity9			1
pictured : the @entity23 ' one of the town 's claims to fame is that the real - life musketeer @entity28 - the hero of @entity30 's book @entity31 - died fighting for the @entity16 in a siege of @entity5 and there is a statue of him in @entity35			1
' the statue carries the @entity31 ' famous motto : ' @entity38 , one for all			2
' that 's a philosophy i like - democratic			1
' according to legend , @entity28 ate his last breakfast in the kitchen of the castle in @entity5 where i live			1
one of @entity5 's must - see attractions is the statue of real - life musketeer @entity28 in @entity35 ' it is often said that @entity5 people have a @entity52 way of life : we like to drink wine , eat good food and relax			1
' we also are a very cosmopolitan bunch			2
in addition to @entity3 , we all speak @entity16 and @entity59 , and as there is a university here , @entity60 is also widely spoken			1
' people are always surprised when i tell them that @entity8 lies just 200 yards from my house and that this is the most northern part of the continent where @entity16 is spoken			2
' as founder of the @entity72 , my love of the waltz is well known			2
but my passion for it really stems from the music rather than the city of @entity77 , which i visited relatively late in life			1
' my introduction to the waltz came when a cafe orchestra needed a replacement violinist and asked me if i was interested in joining			2
i went to the rehearsal and that was the very first time i played a waltz - it was the @entity86 and silver by @entity88			1
i 'm going to @entity89 soon , and i 'm going to play that waltz again			2
@entity20 has played in @entity77 , but reveals that he did not first visit the musical city until later in life ' the waltzes by @entity88 are warmer than those by @entity94			1
@entity94 was more intellectual - by that , i mean he was a genius			1
like most of his great musical contemporaries , he was universally admired - @entity98 , for example , said he would have given anything to have written the @entity101			1
' for me , @entity94 is the composer of the waltz			1
i 've composed some waltzes myself , but it 's difficult to make them as good as his			1
' the @entity107 are not keen on being described as a reincarnation of @entity94			2
we were once performing in @entity110 , and a few of us were in the hotel bar having a drink			2
in the same bar were musicians from the @entity116			2
we were talking and drinking , and after several beers one of them said : ‘ it ’s not possible that you can play a waltz as it should be played because only we @entity107 can play the waltz ! ’ ' i think that ’s nonsense because i ’m a musician			2
even if i were an @entity127 , it would make no difference			2
when you ’re a good musician , you are able to play any kind of music			2
' when i finally went to @entity107 , i performed my first waltz in the wonderful @entity133 in @entity77			0
afterwards , i heard there was a riot in the city because they wanted to know who allowed me to play there			1
however , i now go back to @entity77 every year – it has become a tradition			0
one of @entity20 's biggest professional accomplishments ? playing @entity144 's @entity143 centre stage : he also fondly remembers the thrill of taking the stage at @entity150 's @entity149 ' people are often warning me about the perils of playing in certain places			1
for example , someone once said : watch out when you play in @entity144 , the audiences are spoilt			0
’ but when i actually perform in these cities , the audiences are all so warmhearted and they want to enjoy themselves			0
' my greatest performing thrill was probably when i first took the stage at @entity150 ’s @entity149 – anybody who is anybody has played there			0
and i ’ll never forget the joy of playing at @entity144 ’s @entity143 or the @entity133			0
i ’ve been very fortunate			0
one place i have n’t played but would love to is on the @entity167			0
sir @entity168 tells me he is going to build a hotel there and has asked if i want to be the first to play in it			0
all in the family : @entity20 's father began his career as a conductor of the @entity176 in @entity9 ' music runs in my family			1
my father , @entity179 , was a conductor of the @entity176 in @entity9 , before working in @entity5 with the @entity180			1
once he dressed the whole orchestra in @entity183 costumes and had them driven through the town in a horsedrawn carriage			0
i think i have probably inherited a little bit of his crazy gene			0
' i travel for my work , so for pleasure i like to stay at home			1
my wife and i do , however , spend a couple of days each year at the @entity8 coast with the grandchildren			0
if we decide to venture further afield , we like to go to @entity197 or @entity198			0
' i adore @entity198 so much that my new show is titled @entity200			0
@entity201 and @entity198 go together so well			0
' i adore @entity198 so much that my new show is titled @entity201 in @entity198 , ' he says ' i have n’t yet performed there , but some of my favourite concerts have been elsewhere in @entity204			1
i did a tv special in @entity206 , a wonderful old town in @entity207			0
i do n’t really have any appetite for luxurious holidays			0
i ’ve been to @entity211 three times – two of those occasions were to receive the @entity215 – but i have to say i ’m always glad to return to @entity5			1
i ’m famous and i sell a lot of records , but home is where my heart is			1
' i keep busy when i ’m at home			1
like most of the @entity3 , @entity5 is a great place to cycle , although i ’ll never exhaust myself climbing its hills			1
the highest point in the town is 1,300 ft above sea level , prompting some to jokingly call it the @entity229			0
' i ’ve discovered on my travels that an awful lot of people do n’t really know very much about my country			2
i can go to @entity234 and people will say to me : ‘ @entity2 ? is that in @entity237 ? ’ they do n’t know where it is			0
' i tell everybody that i live in a beautiful country , because i really do love it			0
i ’ve travelled the whole world and i ’m very glad i live in @entity2			0
each summer , @entity5 hosts an open - air concert in the main square with crowds of up to 12,000 each night ' one of the highlights of my year is the annual summer open - air concert in the main square in @entity5			1
this year , for our tenth anniversary , we played eight shows			0
every night we were performing to 12,000 people			0
it ’s great for @entity5 because the hotels and restaurants do such good business			1
' and in the run - up to @entity261 , our big concert series takes place in the @entity263 and @entity264			1
this year there will be shows in @entity267 , @entity268 , @entity269 , @entity270 , @entity271 , @entity272 , @entity273 , @entity150 , @entity274 and @entity275			0
i ’m shortly launching a campaign to encourage everybody to learn how to waltz			0
anyone who has been to my concerts knows that people love to get up and waltz in the aisles			0
' perhaps at this year ’s concerts there will be even more people joining in – they ’re a great way to get into the @entity261 spirit			0
' for more information go to @entity288			0
@entity20 ’s new album , @entity289 , is out on november 3			1
his @entity263 arena tour runs from december 5 to 22 – see andrerieu.com			0
the 2014 @entity291 will be shown in more than 100 @entity263 cinemas on november 2 and 3			0
