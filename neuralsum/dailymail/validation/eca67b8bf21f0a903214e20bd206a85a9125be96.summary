@entity1 prop @entity0 will be gripped by anticipation as saturday 's decisive @entity4 clash with @entity5 nears its climax , knowing he could have a critical late role to play			1
@entity8 and @entity9 are also competing for the title on an afternoon of staggered kick - offs that promises a nerve - shredding conclusion to a @entity13 that will almost certainly be decided by points difference			1
favourites @entity1 are in the driving seat as they will be aware of the target they require if they are to lift a first piece of silverware under head coach @entity20 , raising the prospect of a pivotal final quarter at @entity23			1
@entity0 ( right ) is anticipating a tense @entity4 finale when @entity1 play @entity5 on saturday @entity20 's @entity1 side could win the @entity4 , with the @entity26 later on in the year @entity27 cold be unleashed to help @entity1 get extra points against @entity5 in the final moments of the game it is in the midst of this scenario that explosive front row @entity0 will be summoned from the bench and ordered to wreak as much havoc as possible for the brief time he is on the pitch			1
' the last 15 minutes against @entity5 could be the most crucial spell of our @entity4 so far , so we know we have to come on and make a difference , ' @entity0 said			1
' as a bench we 're always trying to have an impact on the game			2
when you 're coming on in the last 10 - 15 minutes , there ca n't be any excuses like you 're tired			2
' every replacement player gets restless in that second half			2
we all want to get on as soon as possible and get ourselves into the game			0
' around the 60 - minute mark you 're on the edge of your seat waiting for the coach to give you the heads - up , but you have to try and stay relaxed and composed until you get the call			0
' when you go on , the first thing to do is ensure the set - piece is stable and then try to get involved as much as possible , get your hands on the ball , make tackles , get around the pitch and make an impact			0
' the bench has a massive role to play in the game now			0
it 's not just about the xv , it 's about the 23 - man squad			2
' @entity5 have world - class players on their bench who come on and make a massive difference for them			1
we have to make sure we do the same			0
' @entity0 will operate in the eye of the storm as the giant @entity79 and @entity80 packs slug it out over 80 minutes in search of the foothold that will propel their team to victory			0
@entity0 feels @entity5 players such as @entity87 ( left ) and @entity88 will be a hard test @entity0 says @entity5 's physicality will provide a challenge for @entity1 as they look for @entity4 glory lock @entity93 has described @entity5 ' forwards as ' big dudes ' and @entity0 insists the @entity96 must be ready to fight fire with fire as they seek to end a sequence of three successive runners - up finishes in the @entity4			1
' we 've seen the threat @entity5 pose with their pack and they have some big , heavy boys with an all - round game , but their set - piece is their bread and butter , ' @entity0 said			1
' as a pack we have to stand up to them first and foremost and then challenge them with our all - court game			0
' i think they 're the biggest pack we play against			0
@entity118 ( tighthead prop , 6 ' 4 ' and 25 stones ) is a big boy and you do n't want him running at you at full pace			0
' they have some big boys , but we have some big boys ourselves so we have to stand up to them and match them in terms of physicality			0
' these big forwards nowadays are massive but they can still get around the pitch			0
' @entity0 also referred to the threat posed by @entity5 's tighthead prop @entity118 ahead of the encounter @entity1 start as pre-match favourites and are 4/5 to win the @entity13 , but @entity0 insists they must be pitch perfect if he is to celebrate winning the title alongside brother and team - mate @entity136			1
' winning the @entity4 has been our target and to do it would be massive			1
we lost to @entity9 but now have another chance to do it			2
we will have to perform at our best to beat @entity5 , ' @entity0 said			1
' just to win the @entity4 is special			1
the added bonus would be that my brother will be there			0
it 's added motivation for us to go out there and perform			2

@entity1 's points difference can see them win @entity4 on saturday
they will have to maintain a superior points difference to @entity9
@entity20 's side must beat @entity5 if they are to win the *competition*
