@entity0 can solve many diy dilemmas but one man had to resort to using it to fix his teeth thanks to being fitted with dodgy veneers			1
@entity6 , 36 , from @entity7 , needed to have veneers after he fell down the stairs at work and cracked his two front teeth			1
the health worker had to have two veneers put on his front teeth but years later , it started to wobble			2
he visited a dentist who recommended further veneers , leaving his mouth full of ill - fitting , discoloured and misshapen teeth			1
no more superglue : @entity6 can smile again after having his veneers replaced then the front veneer started wobbling again and would pop off at any moment			1
tired of all his trips to the dentist , @entity6 decided to try and manage it himself by using superglue			1
he said : ' my coping mechanism to stop it falling off is superglue			2
i just stick it on myself			0
unfortunately that meant i have had instances when my tongue has stuck to the veneer			0
' as well the danger of ingesting superglue , @entity6 's solution left him at risk of gum disease and low in confidence			1
he said : ' it stops me from smiling and laughing if i know it has come loose			0
my general mood is quite low			0
it effects my confidence in my job and puts me off talking to people			0
' when i look in the mirror i see the difference in the shape and colour of my teeth and i do n't like what i see			0
i often feel it has come loose in my mouth and the whole thing can come off			0
' unstuck : @entity6 has been forced to stick his veneers in using superglue after a dentist bungled them before : the health worker 's teeth were discoloured and wonky and one veneer kept becoming unstuck unstable : @entity6 's dodgy veneers regularly fall out - much to his acute embarrassment @entity6 appeared on tv show @entity66 to see if there was anything their experts could do to help him			1
skilled cosmetic dentist dr @entity71 recommended @entity6 overcome his fear and get back in the dentist chair in order for his smile to be fixed			2
he was alarmed at the state of @entity6 's veneers that were causing his teeth to become decayed and left him at risk of infection and gum disease , and immediately suggested that @entity6 have all the original veneers removed and replaced			1
before : @entity6 in his salad days before the succession of toothy disasters began after : now he has straight , pearly whites after the treatment , @entity6 was delighted with the change and could n't stop smiling			2
he said : ' i 've got some much more confidence just from this change and i can actually use them as would normal teeth			0
' @entity6 was assured his new smile would last for years as long as he looked after them			2
his husband was delighted with the new look and by how happy it made @entity6 feel			1
' there 's such a difference - now i have a happy husband again			0
