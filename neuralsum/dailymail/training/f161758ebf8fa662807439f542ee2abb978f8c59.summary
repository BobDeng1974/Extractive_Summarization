by @entity1 reporter he may never have been destined for the dinner table , but that does n’t make @entity5 ’s story of survival any less remarkable			0
for this pet turkey , it was a greedy fox rather than a hungry human that sparked a chain of events that would put his life in jeopardy			1
@entity5 went missing for ten days after being snatched by the fox , leaving owner @entity17 , 32 , fearing the worst			1
reunited : @entity5 and his owner @entity17 , 32 , after the turkey went through his death - defying journey mrs @entity17 , 32 , and her son @entity22 , ten , found a trail of blood and feathers in their garden at @entity28 near @entity29 , @entity30			1
her husband @entity31 , 39 , searched nearby fields and hedgerows in vain for @entity5 , a @entity30 black turkey weighing 15lbs , before giving him up for dead			1
but unknown to them , @entity5 had escaped from the fox and turned up battered on the doorstep of a woman who lives half a mile away			1
she fed him corn and table scraps and let him sleep in her garage at night until she returned from work four days later to find he had wandered off from her garden			1
@entity5 was strutting around on his own when he was attacked again by a border terrier which was out for a walk			2
the male owner of the dog managed to prise @entity5 free from his dog 's jaws and took his pet home			1
he then returned to pick up @entity53 and took him to a friend who lives five miles away in @entity55 , so she could look after him as she already had ducks and chickens			0
meanwhile mrs @entity17 heard from other her next door neighbour how @entity5 was being looked after by the woman who lives half a mile away from her			1
but when she tracked her down , she found out that he had gone			0
mrs @entity17 said ' the lovely lady had been caring for him , putting him in her garage at night and letting him in her garden during the day			1
' but when she returned from work one evening @entity5 had gone without a trace			0
my heart sank , i was too late			0
' survivor : @entity5 was attacked by a fox and later a dog , but lived to cluck another day mrs @entity17 then launched a @entity71 campaign to try and find @entity5 her pet led her to the family in @entity55 just two hours later			1
she said : ' to my utter amazement i got a message from someone who had seen my cry for help			0
she said : " i think i have got your turkey here			2
" ' after nearly falling through the floor i made contact with the lady who was actually in @entity55 , about five miles away			0
' he is now back safely with us after his amazing adventure			0
he must be the luckiest turkey in the world			2
' he is fortunate enough to be a much - loved pet at a time when millions of other turkeys end up being eaten for @entity93			0
' but then he also survived being snatched by a fox and attacked by a dog			1
' mrs @entity17 who runs @entity97 dog kennels with her husband in @entity28 said that @entity5 had been roosting seven feet up a tree in her garden when he was grabbed by the fox			1
she said : ' i thought he was safe in his tree , but somehow this fox nabbed him			1
it looked liked a fox was claiming his @entity93 lunch early			2
' we knew it had to be a fox because of all the feathers and the blood that we found in the garden the next morning			2
home : @entity5 was eventually returned to mrs @entity17 's garden after a @entity71 campaign reunited him and his family ' we looked around but found no sign of him so we thought it was certain that he had been taken away and eaten			1
' we also heard that a fox had taken one of our neighbour 's chickens			2
it was horrendous - we were in mourning			0
' apparently when he turned up on this woman 's doorstep , he had a bad cut on his breast and his wing was bleeding , so somehow he must have fought back against the fox and got away			2
' when we got him back , he had also lost a lot of flight feathers and had a scar under his wing			0
we do not know how much damage was done by the fox and how much by the dog			1
' his wounds are healing up nicely now , but he can not fly at the moment because his feathers are missing which i suppose is quite a good thing			0
' it means he can not get back into his tree to roost so we are locking him up at night with our ducks in our children 's wendy house so he is safe			0
' mrs @entity17 added : ' when he was missing , my father was telling me that there was no way we would get him back as anyone who found him would keep him for a free @entity93 dinner			1
' he is such a character and it is great to have him back			0
he is part of the family and loves playing with our four dogs			0
' he watches us eat through the conservatory window so there 's no way i could eat turkey with him watching			2
' we 'll have ham this year			0
i think turkey is definitely off the menu for the foreseeable future			0

@entity17 , 32 , thought her turkey had died after he *disappeared* for ten days
but despite being attacked by a fox and later a dog , the bird survived
he was later reunited with his owner following a @entity71 campaign
