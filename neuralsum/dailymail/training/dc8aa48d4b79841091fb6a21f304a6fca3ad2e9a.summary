@entity0 was released from jail in the early hours of friday armed with some new skills that might come in handy should football decide against giving him a second chance			1
in the two and a half years the former @entity8 striker has spent in @entity9 , a @entity10 facility for sex offenders in @entity12 , he has performed various jobs			1
he was a painter and decorator for a while , and also worked in the prison gymnasium — a role that enabled him to stay fit and be as ready as he possibly can for a return to professional sport			2
@entity0 , who played for @entity8 before his conviction , was released from prison on friday the @entity24 footballer , who last played for @entity8 , was pictured leaving @entity9 family and friends arrived at @entity0 ' mother 's house in @entity29 following his release on friday that , of course , is the intention of the 25 - year - old @entity35 striker and it seems to be the intention of @entity8 to facilitate that return			1
publicly , the @entity40 club say they are still wrestling with the moral dilemma of having a convicted rapist in their team			0
their co-chairman , @entity45 , has said they are ‘ puzzling ’ through the problem and will not necessarily reach a decision any time soon			0
@entity49 , their manager , said this week that he would leave the decision to his employers			1
the club spokesman offers no comment , neither do members of the official supporters ’ club on an issue that divides the fanbase			0
this newspaper called two members of the supporters ’ club on friday , one of whom was a woman			2
both refused to comment and hung up			0
these , of course , are innocent people			0
they did not rape a 19 - year - old woman in a hotel room near @entity73 in may 2011			1
but they might be interested to know that there is a desire among the hierarchy at @entity78 to see @entity0 return to the club			1
it might not be an opinion held by everyone but it is one shared by certain individuals in positions of power			0
indeed , officials have even been heard to echo the view being expressed by @entity0 ’s family and his supporters that he was wrongly convicted by a jury in @entity93 on april 20 , 2012			1
of course , nobody will admit to that at the moment			0
earlier this week a club spokesman refused to comment on the fact they continued to pay @entity0 ’s £ 20,000 - a - week wages for more than three months after he was jailed			1
they might have released him at the end of a contract that expired on june 30 , but they chose not to sack him even though a criminal conviction surely amounted to gross misconduct			0
the evidence suggests the club have far from deserted a 25 - year - old who has scored 48 goals in 113 games for them , including 35 in 42 games during the 2011 - 12 campaign that was suddenly brought to a premature end			1
this is a player , remember , who has been capped 13 times by @entity35 and cost £ 3million when the @entity120 bought him from @entity121 in july 2009			0
there is the fact that @entity49 and co-owner @entity124 visited @entity0 in jail in april , reportedly to invite him back to training on his release			1
@entity0 ( left ) , who made 13 appearances for @entity35 prior to his conviction , may return to the international scene @entity8 boss @entity49 ( left ) and co-owner @entity124 ( right ) both visited @entity0 in prison and there is a suggestion dialogue has continued throughout his imprisonment between @entity0 ’s family and his representatives and the club			1
despite numerous attempts to contact him , @entity124 has been unavailable for comment this week			2
this would explain why no effort appears to have been made to secure @entity0 employment elsewhere			2
his name has not been touted around to clubs in desperate need of a decent striker			0
presumably this is because his family are as confident of seeing him return to @entity78 as they appear to be of having his conviction overturned			0
his case was rejected by three judges at the @entity153 in @entity154 in november 2012 , but now @entity0 , who plans to issue a video statement next week , will take his case to the @entity157 with a legal team employed by his girlfriend ’s millionaire father			1
beyond the 150,000 people who have put their names to a petition opposed to seeing @entity0 return to professional football , plenty have had their say			1
while leading voices within the game believe in the basic principle of giving anyone who has served their sentence a second chance — with @entity175 boss @entity174 chief among those voices — senior politicians have expressed what is probably a wider - held view			0
@entity175 chief executive @entity174 insists @entity0 should be allowed to return after serving his time former minister for sport and @entity8 fan @entity182 does not want @entity0 back at the club deputy prime minister @entity184 , a @entity185 mp , has warned the football club against re-employing a convicted rapist and @entity182 added his voice to the debate			1
standing outside @entity78 , the former minister for sport and @entity185 mp said it would be a ‘ sad day for football ’ if the player was taken back			0
‘ it ’s a very sad episode , but @entity0 is a convicted rapist , ’ said @entity182 , a lifelong @entity120 fan			2
‘ i would n’t want to see him in a @entity8 shirt , or that of any other club , until he acknowledges what he did was wrong and indeed shows remorse for his actions			2
i believe that will give him his pathway back to professional football			0
’ right now @entity8 seem to have adopted a tactic often employed by politicians : gauging the reaction before committing one way or the other			2
@entity209 , the @entity8 player turned professional boxer , said : ‘ if you pride yourself on being a family club like we do , you ca n’t have a convicted rapist as your star striker			2
i do n’t want to see @entity0 back at @entity8			1
’ former @entity8 footballer @entity209 has said he would not welcome @entity218 back on the official @entity0 website , his supporters insist he is a role model who will ‘ make a personal and profound statement by video ’ next week			1
they also continue with their campaign to discredit the victim in that hotel room that night			1
in december 2012 , @entity0 ’s cousin , @entity226 , was one of nine people ordered to pay the woman £ 624 for revealing her identity			1
@entity230 called the victim a ‘ money - grabbing slut ’ and accused her of ‘ ruining lives ’			0
the @entity233 has vowed to crack down on any chants ridiculing @entity0 ’s victim and ‘ celebrating ’ his crime — if and when his career resumes			2
@entity238 , indeed society , does lack consistency in dealing with these cases			0
@entity241 remains a professional footballer after two serious convictions			0
he spent three years in jail after causing death by dangerous driving in 2003 and was found guilty of common assault , with a charge of sexual assault dropped , in may 2012			1
the former @entity251 striker now plays for @entity252 in the @entity253			0
@entity241 ( left ) and @entity254 ( right ) both served time in prison before returning to football an incident in december 2008 saw @entity254 sentenced to 18 months in jail after being convicted of sexual assault and assault occasioning actual bodily harm			2
for an incident that involved a 20 - year - old female student , he was also placed on the @entity264 for seven years			1
at the time , @entity265 cancelled his contract and @entity254 ’s appeal against the conviction was unsuccessful			0
but football clubs had @entity254 back , as did the @entity271 national team , with @entity8 the last club he represented			1
when video evidence emerged last month of american football star @entity274 assaulting his wife in a lift , he was sacked by the @entity277 and suspended indefinitely by the @entity278			0
but @entity279 , like @entity0 a convicted rapist , has been rehabilitated to such an extent that he has even appeared in a major @entity283 movie			2
in 2011 , almost two decades after his conviction , @entity279 was inducted into the @entity285			0
last year , however , the authorities would not grant him access to the @entity288 to promote his autobiography because of his conviction			0
when it comes to @entity0 , the next move rests with @entity8			1

the @entity296 *maintained* his fitness by working in @entity9 's gym
@entity0 is hoping to return to @entity8 's first team set up
@entity8 manager @entity49 and co-owner @entity124 visited @entity0 in prison in april
@entity0 was released from jail in the early hours of friday *morning*
the 25 - year - old was found guilty of raping a 19 - year - old woman in a hotel room near @entity73 in may 2011
