these images show the blossoming of @entity2 in east @entity3 from the ruins of the @entity6 bombings towards the end of @entity8 @entity10 and @entity11 bombers dropped 3,900 tonnes of explosives on the @entity14 city during four raids on 13th - 15th february 1945 , killing an estimated 25,000 people and reducing the city to rubble			1
the bombing , ordered by @entity21 marshal sir @entity20 , was widely criticised because of ' blanket bombing ' which hit civilian areas as well as military targets - killing thousands of innocents			0
the resulting firestorm is said to have reached temperatures of over @entity56 ( @entity57 ) , destroying over 1,600 acres of the city centre			1
the victims - mostly women and children - died in savage firestorms whipped up by the intense heat of 2,400 tons of high explosive and 1,500 tons of incendiary bombs			0
it was initially claimed that up to 250,000 civilians lost their lives in the @entity2 bombings but an official report released after the war showed the casualty figure was in fact closer to between 22,500 and 25,000			2
a police report written shortly after the bombings showed that the city centre firestorm had destroyed almost 12,000 houses , including 640 shops , 18 cinemas , 39 schools , 26s pubs and the city zoo			1
out of the ruins : what is left of @entity84 square is pictured in 1946 , and today as the city is being transformed once again � � different views : a statue on the tower of @entity89 looks out over the ruins of @entity2 's city centre following the bombings of february 13 , 1945 , and the restored statue today , looking out over a vastly different city rebuilding : propaganda director @entity95 , @entity2 mayor @entity96 and town architect dr @entity97 are seen in the wreckage of @entity2 outside @entity89 in march 1947 , and now , rebuilt again saving the painting : the @entity101 palace , an art gallery built in @entity103 in central @entity2 , pictured in the year after the bombings and today , was destroyed , but much of its collection had been salvaged before the war these images show the ruins of the @entity109 , a lutheran church in @entity2 , and the then empty pedestal for a statue of @entity46 following the february bombings of 1945 , as well as the reconstructed church and statue in 2015 the destruction of @entity2 has been subjected to much debate in the 70 years since the war			1
although no one has ever been charged over the bombings , several historians both in @entity3 and former @entity6 nations hold the opinion that the bombing was a war crime			1
@entity10 prime minister @entity126 , ultimately responsible for the attack , distanced himself from the bombing of @entity2 shortly afterwards			0
an @entity21 memo issued to airmen on the night of the attack said : @entity2 , the seventh largest city in @entity3 and not much smaller than @entity132 is also the largest unbombed builtup area the enemy has got			2
in the midst of winter with refugees pouring westward and troops to be rested , roofs are at a premium , not only to give shelter to workers , refugees , and troops alike , but to house the administrative services displaced from other areas			0
' at one time well known for its china , @entity2 has developed into an industrial city of first - class importance ...			2
the intentions of the attack are to hit the enemy where he will feel it most , behind an already partially collapsed front ... and incidentally to show the @entity156 when they arrive what @entity157 can do			0
' the @entity157 , which suffered the highest casualty rate of any @entity10 unit , losing 55,573 of its 125,000 men , eventually got a memorial in 2012 .			0
