many @entity3 i meet say there is a pressure on them to be silent about their faith			0
' though there can be no question of a comparison with the powerlessness and weakness of the @entity40 in the @entity21 , there is an increasing timidity on the part of churchgoers in the @entity30 - about even admitting that they have a faith in the workplace			1
' the issue of @entity3 ' religious freedom in the workplace has repeatedly appeared in the headlines over the past few years			0
warning : prince @entity50 has spoken of his concerns about the oppression of @entity3 in the @entity21 in january , a @entity54 employee who was banned from wearing a cross at work won a â ‚ ¬ 2,000 payout after a court determined that her religious rights had been breached			1

' in fact this government , which has conspicuously sought friendly and co-operative relationships with the churches , is doing just as much to wash its hands of persecuted @entity82 communities as any of its predecessors			0
' concerns : @entity12 said that many people are complacent about @entity82 's place in society he suggested that many people overlook the plight of @entity3 because the religion is considered to be comparatively powerful thanks to its historical dominance in the @entity30			1
