@entity11 said the response of the judge in charge of last year ’s media ethics inquiry had been a ‘ cause for concern ’			2
the mp , who wants the @entity18 to carry out a full investigation , said : ‘ he has come across as either lacking in nous or staggeringly incurious			1
’ @entity22 ' barrister mr @entity21 and mrs @entity23 , a member of @entity1 ’s legal team , claim their relationship did not start until after the inquiry @entity11 has criticised @entity1 's lack of action the @entity29 revealed last week that @entity30 , a counsel to the @entity1 inquiry , had had an affair with @entity21 , a barrister representing advocates of statutory press regulation			1
in an article on the @entity38 website , mr @entity11 said : ‘ the @entity18 ’s code of conduct and related guidance is fairly clear on the matter of affairs between opposing lawyers : these should be avoided lest the perception be created of “ a danger of a breach of confidence or other conspiracy ”			0
‘ one would have thought , given the huge significance and public interest in the @entity1 inquiry , not to mention the cost to taxpayers , that to maintain the inquiry ’s reputation for professionalism the judge would want something like this cleared up properly and quickly			0
‘ it would be rather odd were a major public inquiry into breaches of ethical standards fail to apply the same rigour to itself			0
’ mr @entity11 , who represents @entity64 , said he believed @entity1 would have taken action had a member of his team been having an affair with a barrister representing @entity70 , the publishers of the @entity71			1
‘ one would imagine that @entity1 himself would see the matter investigated and the full facts established as a matter of urgency , ’ he said			0
‘ if he did n’t , readers would expect the @entity38 to be leading the charge in finding out what had happened and whether @entity70 had benefited in any way			0
’ @entity1 denied any knowledge of the affair , saying he only found out about the couple 's holidaying in the past week			2
