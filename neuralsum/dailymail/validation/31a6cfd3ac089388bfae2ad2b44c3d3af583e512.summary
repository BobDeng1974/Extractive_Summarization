police seized his laptop as part of the investigation into her death and found 145 indecent images of children stored on it			1
before admitting to possessing the child pornography , @entity25 , 37 , protested he would not receive a fair trial because his previous crime was so high profile			1
guilty plea : @entity3 's killer @entity3 had admitted four counts of posessing child pornography after images were found on a laptop			1
he was jailed in 2011 after strangling the 25 - year - old and dumping her body in snow a judge rejected his argument , jailing him for 10 months at @entity41 , where he was found guilt of murder four years ago			1
the court heard how the paedophile had stored more than 100 images of children on the computer , with the youngest among them of younger than 10			2
flanked by security guards , he held his head in his hands in the dock as the court heard how he had a ' perverse interest in child pornography			2
' in 2011 , at the same court house , @entity25 was convicted of killing 25 - year - old @entity3 after becoming obsessed with her			1
the 25 - year - old 's body was found covered in snow on the outskirts of @entity14 the pair were neighbours , with miss @entity10 living in the groundfloor flat next door to his where , jurors were told , he had watched violent pornography			1
after spurning his advances @entity10 was killed and dumped by the side of the road in @entity72 on the outskirts of the city			0
the jury heard how in the months before @entity77 â€™s death @entity25 had viewed violent porn websites showing women being controlled by men , with images of them bound , gagged and held by the neck and choked			2
others showed a woman who looked chillingly like his victim			0
miss @entity10 's frozen body - which had suffered 43 separate injuries - was found in a similar position to a woman in one pornographic film			2
in 2013 , the @entity93 announced they would pursue charges relating to child pornography			0
his guilty plea today came after a failed attempt by his legal team to have the case thrown out			0
they claimed he would not face a fair trial in and that he would not be given an additional prison sentence			1
@entity105 , on behalf of @entity106 , argued his portrayal in the @entity109 drama @entity110 , who was wrongly accused of miss @entity10 's murder , would prevent fairness			0
judge @entity114 rejected the argument after telling the court it was not his position to comment on the @entity93 decision to prosecute			2
he also discounted the argument that putting @entity25 on the @entity119 would be pointless as it would have lapsed by the time of his release			0
speaking after the sentencing , temporary assistant chief constable @entity123 of @entity124 and @entity125 said prosecution had been ' crucial '			0
@entity25 's legal team argued he would not face a fair trial over the child pornography charges because of his portrayal in an @entity109 drama about @entity133 ( right ) who was wrongly accused of the murder and later successfully sued national newspapers for libel following his arrest for the murder of @entity140 , @entity25 's former girlfriend told police of his haul of pornography ' @entity3 is a dangerous , calculating and manipulative offender who is already serving a life sentence for the murder of @entity3			1
' during the course of the investigation into @entity152 's murder , indecent images of children were found on @entity25 's laptop			1
these offences did not form part of the initial murder trial			0
' although he 's serving a minimum tariff of 20 years ' imprisonment , we felt it was crucial @entity25 was brought to justice for possessing indecent images of children , so the full nature of @entity106 's offending is on record			2
' mr @entity123 said the conviction meant an ' extensive range ' of protective measure could be put in place to manage his behaviour and protect those at risk			0
' it 's possible he may return to the @entity174 following release , so it 's crucial the @entity174 authorities are aware of the risks he poses , ' mr @entity123 added			0
' this could only have been guaranteed if a relevant conviction relating to a sexual interest in children were secured			0
' @entity152 's murder was a shocking and terrible crime which had a significant impact on the whole of the @entity14 community and i hope this latest conviction will ensure her killer is unable to cause any further harm			0
' tributes left on the rural lane where miss @entity10 's body was discovered by walkers on christmas morning in 2010 @entity25 appeared again in @entity41 ( above ) where he was found guilty of murder in 2011			1
