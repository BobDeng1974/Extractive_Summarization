doing more things that were not normal			0
some just childish , dangerous things			0

@entity54 , a @entity54 sergeant who served in uniform in @entity195 and @entity5 before working for @entity20 , told @entity157 : ' it was going against everything that we were trying to do over there			2

whistle blower : @entity54 , a @entity54 sergeant who served in uniform in @entity195 and @entity5 before working for @entity20 , quit after only three months accuser : @entity54 said he quit because of the way he was treated by their colleagues , who would bully them for not joining in the party , out of sheer disgust , and out of concern that their own safety was being compromised by the behavior the company 's senior on - site executive @entity270 was often the ringleader behind the parties and would try to pressure others into taking part , the suit alleges			1

their statement said : ' these individuals are seeking monetary damages by mis - characterizing these actions as " fraud "			0
' the company remains confident that the personal misconduct did not impact the company 's contract performance			0
' if the allegations turn out to be true , it may stoke @entity22 - @entity5 relations even further and could add to rage over perceived @entity22 disrespect for local values			1
' this arrogant image that @entity22 have worldwide , this was feeding right into it , ' said @entity54			2
