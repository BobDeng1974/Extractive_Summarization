' i almost had a heart attack , ' @entity15 told a local news station after he was charged $ 1,666.61 for two breakfast entrees at a @entity6 in @entity20			2
obviously , @entity15 and his wife did n't eat more than $ 1,600 worth of food between the two of them at a @entity6 , so there certainly had to be an explanation for the enormous bill			1
pricey : @entity15 was charged more than $ 1,600 for breakfast at a @entity6 restaurant cheap : in most cases , the most expensive item on a @entity6 menu is less than $ 20 there was - but @entity15 had to take his inflated tab all the way to the company 's corporate office to sort it out after the manager at the restaurant refused to acknowledge that something was clearly amiss			1
the actual bill for @entity44 's breakfast was $ 16.51			1
when the cashier rang it up , he says , something went terribly wrong			0

@entity15 ' bill for breakfast for him and his wife should have been $ 16.51
the bill he accidentally signed was for $ 1,666
when he *explained* the mistake with the cashier , the cashier just argued with him
after taking the mistake up with the restaurant 's corporate office , the charge was reversed
the mixup was the result of a sticky 6 - *key* on the credit card machine
