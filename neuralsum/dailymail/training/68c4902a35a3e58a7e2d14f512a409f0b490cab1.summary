a former majorette who is undergoing sex change treatment to become a man has decided to tell his story and reveal how his younger sister helped him come to terms with being trapped in a female body			1
transsexual @entity7 , 24 , feared a backlash from his family when he decided to undergo gender reassignment surgery after years of trying to live as a girl			1
however , it was n't until younger sister @entity13 , 19 , voiced her support that @entity7 finally decided to go through with the operation			1
@entity7 , from @entity16 , @entity17 , said : ' @entity13 and i are like ' his and hers ' twins - she 's the one person who 's always accepted me as a man , without passing judgement			1
' @entity7 , 24 , ( right ) from @entity16 , @entity17 , says the support of younger sister @entity13 , 19 , ( left ) was vital when he decided to undergo gender reassignment after years of trying to be a girl @entity7 ( right ) pictured with his mother , was once a prize - winning majorette as a child , @entity7 hated dolls and having to wear girly dresses , but loved helping his dad to do ' boys ' jobs ' such as fixing the car			1
' i have four older brothers and my mum was apparently desperate for a daughter , ' said @entity7			1
' we joke now that that wish backfired when she had me			0
i would chuck my barbies under the bed unless they came with a @entity48 doll or a car			0
' but i was n't unhappy because , when you 're a child , gender does n't mean anything and you do n't care about what 's underneath your clothes			2
' @entity7 was picked on at school for his boyish looks and behaviour , only realising at age 14 that he wanted to become a boy @entity7 ( left ) describes his relationship with his younger sister @entity13 ( right ) as like ' his and hers twins ' @entity7 , left , as a little girl aged four , and right , as the 24 - year - old man he is today he continued : ' when i was five , i begged my mum and dad for a little sister			1
ten months later , there she was - and i was even allowed to name her			0
' i liked the name @entity13 , but i called her ' @entity74 ' and even have the name tattooed on my arm now			1
' at secondary school , @entity7 was picked on for wearing boyish baggy clothes , tying his hair back and refusing to wear any make - up			1
it led to him being labelled a lesbian , which the confused teenager assumed must be true			1
' growing up , the most difficult part of my life was trying to be a girl , ' he remembers			0
' i was badly bullied at school - people would shout ' lesbian ' and ' tranny ' at me			2
i did n't know what i was			0
' i was quite a rebel as a teenager because of that			0
' the only person with whom @entity7 could be himself was his younger sister @entity13 , who accepted him as he was			1
@entity7 ( right ) says he could only be himself with his younger sister @entity13 even after @entity7 left home , the siblings stayed close and still share secrets , support each other through difficult relationships and regularly enjoy nights out together he continued : ' @entity13 never asked questions or judged me			1
we were so close and when i talked to her i could forget about the names people called me			0
' as she was so much younger , i protected her from what i was going through and did n't go into my concerns about my sexuality			0
' we 'd just spend time together as two siblings , usually watching @entity114 films			0
' @entity7 made the decision to start hormone treatment , which has caused hair to grow on her face at the age of 14 , a conversation with a school teacher led @entity7 to realise that he was n't gay , but actually transgender - a man born in a woman 's body			1
he said : ' i was complaining to a teacher about being called a lesbian and she said to me , " has it ever occurred to you that you might be heterosexual ? "			2
' my whole world just clicked			0
that 's when i really knew i 'd been born in the wrong body			0
' by then , i knew i fancied girls but the word " lesbian " never really fitted			2
' in that moment , i knew i was n't a lesbian - i was a straight man in a female body			2
' @entity7 's parents accepted the revelation and allowed @entity7 to start living as a boy full - time			1
a year later he had his long red hair cut off and shaved his head			0
but the truth was kept from @entity13 until their parents felt she was old enough to understand			1
at 16 , @entity7 had his first relationship with a woman as a ' man ' yet still endured taunts from cruel school bullies			1
when he started his degree in creative writing at the @entity154 in @entity155 , it was the first time he was able to introduce himself to people as a man			2
he said : ' it felt amazing to be myself among new people and not have them judge me			2
i was open with my new friends and explained i was transgender , which was n't a problem for them			2
' even after @entity7 left home , the siblings stayed close and now share secrets , support each other through difficult relationships and regularly enjoy nights out together			1
@entity7 's parents accepted the revelation and allowed @entity7 to start living as a boy full - time , letting him shave his head when he was 15 ( pictured left ) @entity7 said : ' if i 'm having relationship problems , @entity13 's the first person i turn to			1
' even though i was born in a female body , i did n't have a clue how women tick - @entity13 has taught me everything i know about the opposite sex			2
' i see my body as that of a man with female parts stuck on			0
i do n't get stressed out about it but it 's not something i want to look into until i 'm married with children			0
' in april , @entity7 made the decision to start the physical transition to become a man and began hormone treatment , which has deepened his voice and caused hair to grow on his face			1
he is now awaiting a consultation about having his a-cup breasts removed , but does n't plan to have full sex change surgery until he is much older			2
reaching adulthood has not prevented @entity7 from experiencing prejudice and in july this year , he was left devastated after being ejected from the men 's bathroom and told to use the disabled toilet in a nightclub			2
@entity7 said it is a huge comfort knowing that @entity13 will always be there to support him he said : ' i was so embarrassed			1
i do n't know if another punter had said something , but i was in the toilets and a bouncer asked me to leave and use the disabled one instead			0
he made me feel like a freak			0
' if someone genuinely identifies as a man , people need to treat them like a man			0
that 's just a matter of respect			0
' we are the only minority still striving for equality and there are a lot of haters out @entity229 still make insulting comments and say i 'm ' scared to be a girl '			0
' but the one person he knows he can always count on for her unquestioning support is younger sister @entity13			1
he said : ' i know @entity13 will support me through the whole thing			1
she has always stuck up for me and i do n't know where i 'd be without her			0
' @entity13 added : ' in @entity7 , i have got everything i need all in one person			1
i have got the brother who can speak to me like a man , but i have still got a sister i have grown up with			2
and only i have that with her			0
' even though she 's technically my big brother , i still call her my ' sister '			2
i think i 'm the only person who gets away with referring to her as a female			0
' transgender : according to the @entity249 , this is an umbrella term that encompasses all types of trans people , whether cross-dressers ( transvestites ) or those who simply feel they belong to both or neither sex			0
also included are drag queens , drag kings and transsexuals			0
transsexual : more specific than transgender , the term relates solely to people who , like @entity7 , have a strong and continual desire to live and be accepted as a member of the opposite sex			1
many transsexual people have gender reassignment surgery to make their appearance consistent with their preferred gender .			0
