after @entity1 had an unhappy experience during a trip to the dentist , she did what thousands do as a matter of routine : she posted a negative review on a consumer website			1
but that decision could cost her dearly because the dental practice has taken the unusual step of suing her for £ 125,000 damages plus legal costs , saying that her online claims were wrong			1
the firm ’s action has been condemned by the business listings and reviews site @entity20 , which says it could have a chilling effect on free speech			1
the row began when @entity1 , 46 , was referred by her @entity26 dentist to @entity27 in @entity28 , @entity29 , for £ 10,000 worth of tooth implants			1
the row began when @entity1 ( pictured ) posted a negative review of the dental practice			1
after some back and forth correspondence , the firm then said it was taking her to court ‘ initially i saw a lovely dentist there , ’ she says , ‘ but i endured a three week wait before they could begin treatment , received treatment plans with the wrong prices and then , when i got toothache on the other side of my jaw , they said they did not do general dentistry			0
’ disappointed with the service , she posted a review on @entity20 , headed ‘ terrible service – avoid at all costs ’ and gave them just one star			1
‘ everything i wrote was factual and true			0
i am a nervous patient who was looking for a long - term private dentist			0
and i was shocked at how uncaring @entity27 were			2
’ to her astonishment , she received an email from @entity20 in november saying it had received a complaint about her review			1
she then received an email from the dental firm saying it disputed her version of events			1
the surgery , which has a series of excellent five - star reviews on @entity20 claiming it is professional , clean and friendly , said her review was defamatory			1
@entity1 posted the one star review on @entity20 , which has led to accusations that it was defamatory surgery : the @entity27 practice in @entity28 , north @entity29 , which was the subject of the review some of the reviews of the dental practice posted on the @entity20 website recalled positive experiences the firm said it had offered her a number of appointments which she had cancelled , and denied they had left her in pain , adding that her review must be removed			1
‘ the review has had , and continues to have , a significant financial impact on our business			2
we can not allow that damage to our business to continue , ’ wrote @entity27			2
the dental firm 's lawyers wrote to @entity1 to tell her they were taking her to court			1
file image used scared of being sued , @entity1 removed the review			2
however , she put a note on @entity20 saying she did so due to the threat of legal action			2
she then received another letter demanding this note be removed too			0
‘ in return they offered to refund £ 185 of the initial £ 384 fee i paid as long as i agree never to mention @entity27 again			2
but i felt bullied and could n’t agree never to speak about them again			0
’ so @entity27 ’s lawyers wrote again to say they are taking her to court			2
@entity1 has now taken legal advice and been told the review she wrote was not defamatory			1
‘ when i discovered they plan to sue me for £ 125,000 i felt sick			1
it has put me off ever putting a review on a website again			0
’ last night @entity1 , a television producer , said : ‘ when i left that review i did so honestly			2
but this has turned into an utter nightmare			0
there is no way i could pay these damages and the worry of it all has been so huge i am barely sleeping			0
’ her story is a cautionary tale to anyone putting a review on a website that there might be a high price to pay for their freedom of speech			0
@entity27 told @entity1 her review did not match their records , adding : ‘ a review such as yours puts our practice and our employees at genuine risk			1
it affects the livelihoods of dentists , nurses and supporting staff			0
nurses and staff with families , young children and mortgages			0
’ @entity148 , spokesman at @entity20 , said : ‘ businesses that choose to sue customers to silence them rather than address their comments often bring additional unwanted attention to the original criticism			0
@entity154 is n’t a very good substitute for customer service			0
‘ while @entity20 continues to fight to protect the users of its platform , the law in the @entity160 makes it surprisingly easy for businesses to intimidate consumers into removing honest reports of their experiences			0
’ @entity165 did not respond when approached for comment .			0
