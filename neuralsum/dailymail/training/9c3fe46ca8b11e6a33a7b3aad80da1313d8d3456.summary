by @entity0 published : 11:13 est , 27 june 2012 updated : 02:28 est , 28 june 2012 tell all : @entity2 was a grad school refugee when she joined @entity3 as employee # 51 in 2005 @entity3 has developed an experimental feature called ‘ @entity6 ’ which would give secret accounts to people who did not even sign up , a new book claims			1
engineers wanted to create shadow pages for those who were tagged in photos by their friends in the hope they would cave in and join the social networking website , @entity2 , the author of @entity16 : a journey into the @entity18 , says			1
nobody at @entity3 ‘ even flinched ’ when staff raised this disturbing new twist as they were so blinded by their mission to take over the world			0
the book also claims that in 2007 @entity3 technicians worked on programme called ‘ @entity29 ’ which would let users compare and rate women in echoes of founder @entity35 ’s sexist ‘ @entity37 ’ app he developed at @entity36			1
it confirms for the first time that @entity3 staff have a programme called ‘ @entity42 ’ which lets them track who has been visiting their profiles and in the early days of the social networking website , employees were given the ‘ master ’ password with no security checks at all - and allowed to do as they pleased			1
the claims are in a new book by @entity2 who worked for @entity3 between 2005 and 2010 and worked her way up from customer relations to be the speechwriter for its founder @entity35			1
she claims that in @entity60 everyone at the company was ‘ so convinced that @entity3 was something that everyone should have that when the product team created an experimental feature called dark profiles in 2006 , nobody even flinched ’			1
people can be tagged in @entity3 photos even if they do not have a profile , and the idea was to create a ‘ dark ’ version which could apparently be activated if they finally signed up			1
rising star : @entity2 worked for @entity3 between 2005 and 2010 and worked her way up from customer relations to be the speechwriter for its founder @entity35 @entity2 writes : ' it reminds me now of the way members of the @entity80 church convert dead people , following the logic that if they had know about @entity80 when they were alive they would have been believers ’			1
one of @entity35 ’s colleagues later told her : ‘ you see , @entity35 always had this idea for a kind of @entity89 for people , or what he called a " dark @entity3 " , where each person would have a wall and people could write anything about them on it			1
‘ that was actually what he was going to make first at @entity36			0
but he realised that people would n’t use something that did n’t allow them to erase the bad things people said about them , so he made @entity3 instead ’			2
thus the product they built was a kind of compromise			0
’ @entity2 , who has an @entity105 masters from @entity106 , claims that as recently as 2007 @entity3 engineers were working on ‘ @entity29 ’ despite being obviously sexist			2
the plan was to put two women ’s @entity110 with space for a viewer to put a score for each			0
the tagline was ‘ @entity116 : never judge a ( face ) book by her cover ’ and engineers registered the websites @entity123 and @entity124 , though they never made it into the full version			0
insider : one of @entity35 's colleagues later told her : ' you see , @entity35 always had this idea for a kind of @entity89 for people , or what he called a " dark @entity3 " , where each person would have a wall and people could write anything about them on it ' @entity35 had already developed such a programme at @entity36 and called it @entity140 - but this could potentially be for all of @entity3 ’s 25 million users at the time			1
@entity2 , who is originally from @entity144 , @entity145 , writes : ‘ it was moments like these that i realised it was the great and twisted genius of @entity3 for anyone who was interested in rating things constantly , as @entity35 and the engineers who made these types of applications seemed to love doing			1
' @entity35 always had this idea for a kind of @entity89 for people , or what he called a " dark @entity3 " , where each person would have a wall and people could write anything about them on it			1
' @entity2 , @entity16 ‘ @entity3 made it possible for men to have endless photographs of women available for judging , and women simply by being on @entity3 became fodder for the judging like so many swimsuit models in a @entity172 pageant			1
’ rumours have long circulated of a feature which allows you to see who exactly has visited your profile , and in her book @entity2 confirms that it does - but only for @entity3 staff			2
she said that to her surprise ‘ @entity42 ’ as they called it showed that her female friends spend longer on her profile than her male friends			0
@entity185 also reveals her shock at being given the password to the ‘ master ’ @entity3 account called ‘ @entity190 ’ which they could use to check through any person ’s profile they wanted			0
@entity195 : @entity2 , who has an @entity105 masters from @entity106 , claims that as recently as 2007 @entity3 engineers were working on ' @entity29 ' despite being obviously sexist in her customer service role , she would use this to resolve problems users were having and deal with genuine complaints			2
but she writes : ‘ i experienced a brief moment of stunned disbelief : they just handed over the password with no background check to make sure i am not a crazed stalker ’ the claims come at a difficult time for @entity3 - it recently sparked yet another backlash after being caught out trying to force its 900 million users to adopt its own email service			2
it was accused of ‘ hijacking ’ users ’ contact details and deleting their personal email addresses without asking them first			0
in its place is an @ facebook.com one instead - even if they never use it			0
@entity3 also still reeling from its bungled ipo which wiped a third off of its value and sparked a $ 3billion lawsuit from investors			0
the claims in the book will raise fresh questions about a ruling by @entity231 ’s @entity230 last year that @entity3 was not collecting profiles for non-users			2
the internet regulator had claimed in a complaint that @entity3 was harvesting data from people without an account such as names , phone numbers and email addresses			0
but in a ruling commissioner @entity242 said that they could find no evidence that use was made of such information			0
its decision does not exclude the possibility that back in 2006 - or even sooner - ‘ @entity6 ’ were being actively pursued by @entity3 because the commission ’s investigation took place last year			0
@entity3 declined to comment .			0
