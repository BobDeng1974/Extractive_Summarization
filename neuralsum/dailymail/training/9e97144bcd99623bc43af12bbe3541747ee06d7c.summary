thrifty consumers with an eye for a bargain can score a pair of jeans for as little as seven dollars			1
@entity6 ’s leading retailers such as @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9 have all engaged in a mighty battle to offer the cheapest denim at rock - bottom prices			1
pictured from left to right : @entity20 $ 7 , @entity21 $ 10 and @entity22 $ 7 a @entity23 told @entity17 that customers can buy a pair of jeans ' safe in the knowledge that they 've been produced in an ethically sustainable manner '			1
' our $ 10 jeans are produced by a single factory in @entity32 , which has been audited to meet all our ethical sourcing requirements around worker pay , safety and conditions , ' he said			2
' placing large order volumes with a single factory means the supplier benefits from economies of scale , and can give our customers a great quality product at a terrific price , without compromising @entity9 ’s ethical sourcing standards			2
' @entity8 's classic jeans are on special for $ 7 after a price drop from $ 8 on july 13th 2014 @entity7 's @entity48 jeans $ 7 offer a slight kick at the ankle , yet fitted through the hip and thigh @entity9 were the most expensive of the three retailers , with a price tag of $ 10 @entity17 contacted @entity8 and @entity7 for comment but they have not yet responded			1
fashion expert @entity56 , from @entity57 , told @entity17 that the seven dollar jeans are of low quality and a representation of wasteful ' fast fashion '			2
' they will not last long and you get what you pay for , ' she said			0
' the idea of ‘ fast fashion ’ is that the product will only last a short amount of time , sending you back to buy their cheap jeans over and over again			1
' in the long run you may end up spending more money on lots of cheap jeans , compared to buying two pairs of more expensive high quality jeans			1
' if the jeans are made in @entity6 , they are more likely to be a higher price due to higher wages , but it is also easier to monitor quality			2
overseas , it varies greatly , depending on company standards			0
' @entity17 reporter @entity16 found the @entity20 $ 7 offered the perfect fit and were the most comfortable to wear @entity17 reporter @entity16 found @entity9 's everyday jeans $ 10 offered a good fit and a versatile style that work any time of the year @entity17 reporter @entity16 found @entity7 's @entity48 jeans $ 7 fitted from the waist to the knees before breaking into a slight flare for a balanced , feminine profile fashion designer @entity97 , from @entity6 , told @entity17 that consumers should do more research			1
' people need to be careful about the quality because you do n't know if it 's going to damage your health , ' she said			0
' we do n't know what 's going through in the process and how the dye is being treated			0
' i know it 's hard to find things made in @entity6 but if dye starts coming off after you soak your clothes in a bucket of water - you know it 's not really good for you			2
' it 's important that consumers be active and ask questions from their retailers and know where they 're made from before purchasing			0
' every woman needs that perfect - fitting pair of jeans and it goes without saying that being comfortable in your jeans is the most important thing			0
but when it comes to cheap jeans costing from $ 7 , which pair should you settle on ? @entity17 reporter @entity16 put the cheap jeans to the test			1
@entity20 jeans $ 7 @entity8 ticked all the boxes and were the best pair of jeans out of all three retailers			1
i was surprised at how amazing they felt			0
they offer the perfect fit and sit well from my waist down to my legs			0
they 're probably by far one of the most comfortable jeans i 've ever worn and it made my legs look and feel slim plus the material was gentle on the skin			0
they 're definitely a pair that would go well with everything and a must - have for your wardrobe			0
@entity21 jeans $ 10 @entity9 were the most expensive and offer a good fit and a versatile style that work any time of the year			1
i did find them a bit tight around my knees because they sit so snugly around my legs			0
but you ca n't go wrong with a pair of $ 10 jeans and they got my vote for the best coloured denim out of the three			2
@entity48 jeans $ 7 @entity7 's jeans were my least favourite			1
they fit from the waist to the knees then break into a slight flare for a balanced , feminine profile , which is great for that chic 70s look			0
but they made my legs look and feel wider			0
a current affair tested the durability of all three jeans by putting them through 10 cycles in the washing machine			0
look smart alteration tailor @entity184 , from @entity186 , told @entity187 that a slight colour fade and some shrinkage was found on the @entity7 pair			2
@entity9 jeans shrunk a lot more but kept their colour the best			2
while the @entity8 pair had obvious results - they faded slightly , as well as shrinking after 10 washes			1
@entity199 spokeswoman @entity198 told @entity17 that consumers need to ask themselves whether workers are paid enough to produce garments this cheap			1
‘ it ’s concerning to see garments at such a low price			0
it ’s not the prices that we should be worried about but it ’s whether these companies are respecting workers ' rights , conditions and their safety , ' she told @entity17			2
‘ if you look at a country like @entity218 , 33 percent of their workers are malnourished because they ’re not paid enough to live on and ca n’t eat properly			0
‘ i ’m not talking about an extravagant lifestyle but how can these workers afford a roof over their head , nutrient foods , as well as small savings for weddings , funerals and even a holiday			0
‘ it does n’t necessarily mean that when we pay $ 80 for a pair of jeans that workers are paid more but when it comes to $ 7 , the chances of exploitation do increase			1
’ @entity8 ticked all the boxes for the best and cheapest pair of jeans out of all three retailers , according to @entity17 reporter @entity16 @entity9 has published a list of its supplier factories in @entity244 to ensure transparency and safe working conditions in its overseas supplier factories @entity7 's @entity248 offers a great chic 70s look , with a slight flare for a balanced , feminine profile , according to @entity17 reporter @entity16 ms @entity198 said the minimum wage in @entity218 is $ 100 per month but the living wage is $ 450			1
‘ just recently , there was a striking protest from these garment workers who wanted an increase to $ 170 per month but it ’s still not enough to live on			2
‘ consumers who ask themselves “ can i make a difference ? ” need to know that they should never doubt if they can make an impact on people because companies do listen			0
' @entity8 , @entity7 and @entity9 have signed up to the @entity266 on @entity267 and @entity268 to ensure that all garment factories in @entity244 are safe			1
the accord was established in 2013 after the @entity272 factory in @entity244 collapsed in april last year , killing more than 1100 workers			1
‘ these are all small steps and they lead to results but more needs to be done , ’ ms @entity198 said			0
