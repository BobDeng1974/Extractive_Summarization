@entity29 is the only @entity30 ever to be accepted into the @entity31			0
his mission will make him the first @entity3 national to travel and work in space , under the @entity36 , on a @entity38 - funded mission			1

she spent a week at the @entity15 @entity150			0
the most experienced @entity3 - born astronaut is @entity74 ’s @entity44			2
he has accumulated 374 days in orbit , completing long - duration missions to both the @entity9 and @entity150 .			0

major @entity7 , 41 , will travel to the station in november 2015
the @entity135 graduate is considered the first *official* @entity3 astronaut
this will be his first mission into space since graduating in 2010
was *feared* he would only get a short mission due to the @entity3 's modest contributions to the space programme
