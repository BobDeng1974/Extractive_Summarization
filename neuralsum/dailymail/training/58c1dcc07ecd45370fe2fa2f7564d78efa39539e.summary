by @entity1 reporter published : 20:04 est , 20 april 2013 updated : 20:04 est , 20 april 2013 controversial : @entity2 says that @entity3 is wrong and that children need longer school holidays @entity3 said this week that he wants to see shorter school holidays and longer school days			1
the long summer holiday , he believes , is the product of a 19th century agricultural economy and has no place in the @entity12			2
he wants pupils to compete with @entity14 , where students work harder and longer			2
as always , @entity3 is right in intent but imperfect in execution			1
i so admire the @entity20 ’s guts and zeal			2
every week this pugilist force of nature comes up with a pronouncement which delights or enrages the country			1
the @entity25 would be much duller if it was n’t devoting hours of its output talking about the latest @entity3 - ism			1
this weekend sees people slugging it out on each side of the ‘ holiday and hard work ’ debate			2
but he is plain wrong to think he will improve schools or the lot of children by shortening holidays			1
he wants more school time and less home time , because he thinks pupils will work harder and exam results will improve , with holiday time en masse given over to lessons			1
i am all in favour of longer school days , which would also help working parents , but not for the reasons @entity3 advocates			1
children need extra time in school to experience enrichment in the arts , sport and character education			1
too much time in class and pupils switch off , or they become too tired for homework – a key part of the discipline of learning			2
as a headmaster i know it is counterproductive for students to spend more than five hours a day in lessons			2
exam results have improved massively in the schools i ’ve run , not because i have extended time in lessons , but because of better teaching and smarter learning			2
this is where @entity3 should focus			1
so we need longer school days , but , in the state sector , longer holidays , too			1
it is shortening school holidays which harks back to the @entity80			1
great school lessons are available at home on computers and students benefit from independent study – both of which can be done in the holidays			1
holidays benefit parents and teachers , too			2
improved results come from teachers who are highly motivated			2
play time : @entity2 believes that time away from school benefits children and staff a major incentive to join the profession is the prospect of a six - week summer holiday in state schools , as well as two weeks at @entity102 and @entity103			1
most teachers do n’t squander this time , but use it to enrich their minds , travel , read , attend courses , and simply to relax			0
@entity3 ’s change would undermine the fabric of family life			1
the opportunities holidays provide for the young – to explore , go on visits and attend activities – are invaluable			2
more purposeful pursuits should be available for children during the holidays			2
the education secretary greatly admires independent schools , which achieve results far outstripping state schools in @entity124 , and indeed the schools in the @entity126 and in @entity127 which he so admires			0
but we do so with much longer holidays than state schools enjoy			2
reforms : @entity3 wants to cut school holidays at @entity134 we have 19 weeks of holidays , compared to 13 in state schools , which @entity3 wants to cut still further			1
and why on earth are we trying to emulate @entity14 anyway ? when this country ’s economy led the world in the 19th century , we did not do so by copying anyone else			0
here again , @entity3 is drawing the wrong lessons from this time			1
delve into it deeper and you find that @entity14 schools are dull , dull , dull – it is why their governments are looking to @entity124 ’s best schools			0
that ’s why we should start leading the world with our education , and learn from our best independent and state schools , rather than merely trying to follow others and spending vast amounts of public money on jaunts studying schools abroad			0
for me , the school holiday debate sets major alarm bells ringing			2
if @entity3 does n’t start listening soon , he will put his achievements in education policy since 2010 in jeopardy			1
the week of @entity166 ’s funeral provides a historical perspective from which @entity3 can learn			1
i worry that he is only listening to an - ever narrowing circle of those who tell him what he wants to hear			0
@entity166 fell into that same trap and look what happened to her			0
@entity3 is the greatest success story of the coalition government			1
he is driven by a profound passion to enhance educational opportunities for all pupils , regardless of social class and the schools in which they learn			0
he believes children have lost out because policy has been driven in the interests of education providers – the teachers , university education departments , the administrators and local authorities – rather than the children themselves			0
he is right , and his campaign is magnificent in its ambition			0
@entity166 was one of @entity3 ’s heroes , and more than any other cabinet minister in this government , he is driven by a @entity197 determination to drive his policy through , confront vested interests and defeat them			1
like @entity166 , he has taken on the unions and they are resisting , threatening strikes and mayhem			0
but @entity3 will not stop until he has consigned them to history , as @entity166 did @entity206 and the @entity207			1
@entity208 breaks : @entity134 has 19 weeks of holidays , compared to 13 in state schools , which @entity3 wants to cut still further he has built on @entity166 ’s work with her introduction of the national curriculum			1
he believes rigour and scholarship have been sucked out of many schools			0
too many teachers , he believes , patronise children by underestimating their academic depths			0
‘ @entity226 ’ take precedence over real ones , such as modern languages , maths and physics			0
each child must have a solid core of factual knowledge			0
he has gone further than @entity166 in working to bring outstanding young people into the profession and taking on failing schools			0
all work and no play : mr @entity2 thinks that pupils switch off if they are in class too long he is moving teacher training out of universities and into schools , and is working to encourage the brightest and best undergraduates to become teachers			1
@entity166 took the academically strongest children out of state schools and put them in independent schools with her ‘ assisted places ’ scheme			0
@entity3 instead wants to affirm the state sector , but to make schools more independent of local authorities by them becoming ‘ academies ’ or ‘ free schools ’			1
@entity166 would have applauded , even though she dared not make this move			0
i support and admire all these efforts			0
but if @entity3 wins an a * for his objectives and effort , he achieves a b / c for execution			1
he wants to remain education secretary for all five years of this government to embed changes which the next government would never dare undo			0
but to embed change , you need to carry people with you			0
many of his supporters feel bruised and confused by his pace of change and by the lack of clarity			0
many parents , teachers and heads are on your side , @entity280			0
@entity166 learned from her predecessor , @entity282 , that you have to introduce change step - by - step			0
praise heads and teachers more , and do n’t fight on all fronts			0
let those who want to run extra courses in the holidays do so , but do n’t impose shorter holidays on the whole system			1
my advice is a long summer holiday this august : you ’ll see the value .			0

@entity3 said this week that he wants to see shorter school holidays
but @entity2 , master of @entity134 , *disagrees*
