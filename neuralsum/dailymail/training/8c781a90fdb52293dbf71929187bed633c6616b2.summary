by @entity0 the paralysed have been offered a ray of hope after @entity4 scientists used light to move and control frozen muscles			0
experts from @entity8 and @entity9 made the breakthrough during stem cell research			1
the work is at an early stage but could one day be adapted to help the paralysed walk again			1

the work is at an early stage but could one day be adapted to help the paralysed walk again			1
in the shorter term , it could help sufferers of motor neurone disease , which leads to the gradual paralysis of muscles , including those that control breathing and swallowing			1
paralysis occurs when motor neurons – specialised nerve cells that relay messages from the brain – become damaged , so the researchers set about replacing them			0
they began with embryonic stem cells , or ‘ chameleon cells ’ , capable of turning into every tissue in the body			0
they inserted a gene into the cells that made them sensitive to light and then turned them into motor neurons			2
these designer cells were then transplanted into mice , where they grew and connected with paralysed muscles			0
crucially , when light was shone on them , the muscles moved , the journal @entity49 reports			0
the researchers now want to create an implant that emits light as needed			0
the research used designer cells which were transplanted into mice , where they grew and connected with paralysed muscles			0
crucially , when light was shone on them , the muscles moved @entity8 researcher professor @entity63 said : ‘ a lot of patients live in fear suffocating to death because they ca n’t breathe or choking to death because they ca n’t swallow			2
’ she hopes the first test operations in motor neurone disease patients could start within five years			1
the breakthrough also offers hope to those left wheelchair - bound by car crashes and other @entity76 , the need to make dozens of muscles walk again means this is a more distant dream .			2

@entity8 and @entity9 teams made breakthrough
work is at early stage but could one day help the paralysed walk again
in the shorter term , it could help sufferers of motor neurone disease
