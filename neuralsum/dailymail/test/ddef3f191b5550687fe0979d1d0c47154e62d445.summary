if selected on sunday , @entity0 will form part of a @entity3 guard of honour to recognise the outstanding @entity6 success of his former club			1
there will be no feelings of envy as he applauds @entity11 on to the @entity13 pitch			1
despite enduring much injury - induced frustration in his three seasons in @entity18 , the winger remains adamant he can prove his worth by rekindling the kind of form he once showed in maroon			1
@entity0 made his first start in almost three months last weekend as @entity25 's recorded a 4 - 1 victory over @entity26			1
that followed up a breakthrough win over @entity29 at @entity30 and enhanced confidence ahead of a real litmus test of their recent progress			0
@entity3 ace @entity0 promotes tickets for sunday 's match against @entity11 at @entity13 hearts romped to the title with seven games to spare and currently sit 26 points in front of a @entity3 side fighting to finish as best of the rest ahead of the play - offs			1
this was n't a scenario @entity0 could ever have envisaged when he moved west along the @entity48 in august 2012 , away from @entity50 's teetering reign that would eventually lapse into administration			1
back then , @entity3 were just starting to emerge from their own , even deeper , financial meltdown of liquidation			1
few predicted any on - field problems in their journey back up the leagues			2
@entity3 ' @entity58 & @entity59 training at @entity60 ahead of the clash with @entity11 this season has told a very different story			1
@entity0 , though , insists he has had no regretful thoughts of what it would be like to somehow still be a @entity11 player			1
' no , because i think i would have been away the following season anyway , ' he said			0
' at the time i moved , it was the right time for me , i was kind of forced out , as well			2
' it was just one of those things , it was a good move at the time and if we can go up through the play - offs then i still think it would have been a good move			1
@entity3 ' @entity79 training at @entity60 ahead of their clash with runaway leaders @entity11 ' it 's massive that we do that			1
when i signed for @entity3 with the squad we had , i thought we would go up each year			1
for us as a club - and the supporters and everyone - it 's massive to get back to the top league			2
' my time here has been pretty frustrating , personally			2
the first season i really enjoyed , although i picked up a couple of injuries which did n't help			0
' last season , i had a couple of little niggles pre-season and then i did n't play a lot			0
this season , the exact same			0
hopefully now i can keep myself fit and start afresh if we go up			2
' @entity3 captain @entity102 holds the ball up as his teammates look on during a training session @entity0 is not among the dozen or so first - team players out of contract this summer , with 12 months still left on his deal			1
' the fans have definitely not seen the best of me , ' he admitted			0
' i need to get back playing the way i was before i signed here because that was the reason i signed for @entity3			1
' i know that i 'm good enough to get back to that and hopefully the manager sees that in me			0
' @entity3 trialists @entity117 ( left ) and @entity118 ( right ) are put through their paces during training @entity0 on friday lauded the difference @entity25 has made since his arrival last month			1
the 26 - year - old claimed he now felt more confident about expressing himself on the field			2
' earlier in the season , i played a few games and did n't do too well , but at the same time the team was n't doing as well either and it 's hard to stand out then , ' he said			2
' last saturday we were really attacking and creating a load of chances which made me feel a lot better , a lot more confident			2
the manager has given me the confidence as well since he has come in			0
@entity3 ' @entity136 tests his reaction speeds as he is put through his paces during training ' even before i 'm going on in games , he 'll just tell me to stay wide , get the ball and attack			1
it does n't matter how many times i lose it in the final third , but just to try and make things happen			0
as a winger , that 's what you like to hear - that you 're not going to be criticised for trying to do the right things			1
' hearts have won both previous matches against @entity3 this term but @entity0 believes the gap in those games was not significant			1
' the past few times we have played @entity11 we did n't actually do too badly , ' he added			1
' in the first game of the season we should have won it - i missed a sitter at 0 - 0 and if i had scored it we would have gone on to win the game			2
@entity0 holds the ball up as a @entity3 teammate looks to dispossess him during a training session ' the second game , we started well and they could n't get out of their half			1
but then we had a man sent off which did n't help us			0
' it will be good to play against them on sunday			0
they have been excellent this season and thoroughly deserved to win the title			0
but we will work on how we will play and i am sure we will all be ready			0
' @entity25 is dismissive of any suggestion that @entity11 might somehow slacken off having already secured a @entity180 return			2
@entity11 ' @entity181 ( right ) speaks with teammate @entity182 at training ahead of their game ' if you have won nine on the bounce and you are champions then you are going to have a lot of confidence , ' insisted the @entity13 boss			2
' every one of their players will have that			0
they also have a real good spirit			0
' it is a test for us but every game between now and the end of the season will bring a test			0
going down to @entity201 on thursday will be tough			0
' but i take the point that people will look at the @entity11 game and think it might be a barometer of how far we have come			2
the @entity11 squad train at @entity208 ahead of their fixture with @entity3 on sunday ' we have improved each game and that is all we are asking for again			1
but we will slip up between now and the end of the season , no doubt			0
we wo n't win every game			0
' there will be ups and downs but it is about how we handle it			0
there is a little bit of belief back in the players again , but we know it is only two wins			0
no - one is getting carried away			0
' * all tickets previously purchased for the abandoned @entity3 v @entity11 game at @entity13 on friday , 16 january are still valid			1
tickets are also available from : www.rangers.co.uk , 0871 702 1972 , @entity237 until kick - off prices from £ 21 adults , £ 15 concessions and £ 5 kids .			0
