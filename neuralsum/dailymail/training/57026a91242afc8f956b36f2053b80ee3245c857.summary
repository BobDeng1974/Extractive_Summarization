the thieves struck at this house just three weeks after the names and addresses of legal firearms permit holders were published on the controversial gun map published by the @entity3			1
the paper caused a stir on december 23 when it listed thousands of permit holders in suburban @entity39 and @entity40 counties just north of @entity41 in an interactive map			1
the break - in at @entity44 , @entity8 , was reported at 9.45 pm on wednesday evening			1

police believe that the break - in was a ' random crime ' but others are n't so sure @entity54 sgt. @entity53 said in a statement reported by @entity56 : ' the burglary is still under investigation , and there are no facts to support this correlation at this time			0

the home owner also declined to comment in this case but a @entity101 blasted the gun map after this incident			1
@entity104 senator @entity104 has proposed legislation that restricts gun permit information to law enforcement authorities and he strongly criticized the @entity3			1
' no comment ' : the @entity26 homeowner told @entity110 he had nothing to add while police continued investigations into the burglary ' it is reported that the burglar used the @entity3 ’ interactive gun map to target a home included on the map , ' @entity104 said			1
' @entity3 has placed the lives of these folks at risk by creating a virtual shopping list for criminals and nut jobs			1
' if the connection is proven , this is further proof that these maps are not only an invasion of privacy but that they present a clear and present danger to law - abiding , private citizens			0
' former convicts have already testified to the usefulness of the asinine @entity3 ‘ gun maps ’ yet the reckless editors are evidently willing to roll the dice , gambling with the lives of innocent local homeowners , ' the senator continued			2
' @entity142 's shopping list ? ' both homes are featured on the map that lists the names and addresses of legal gun owners the @entity9 newspaper reportedly hired a team of armed guards to patrol the paper 's headquarters in @entity153 after publishing the names and addresses of nearby gun permit owners			1
the @entity157 reported that @entity3 editor @entity158 hired gun - toting security guards to guard the paper 's offices amid a flurry of angry emails and phone calls in the following days			2
along with an article entitled ' the gun owner next door : what you do n't know about the weapons in your neighborhood , ' the @entity3 map was compiled in response to the december 14 shooting deaths of 20 children and six adults in @entity177 , @entity178 , editors of the @entity181 - owned newspaper said			1
the publication prompted outrage , particularly on social media sites , among gun owners			0
' do you fools realize that you also made a map for criminals to use to find homes to rob that have no guns in them to protect themselves ? ' @entity193 of @entity194 , @entity195 , posted on the newspaper 's web site			2
' what a bunch of liberal boobs you all are			0
' ' reckless ' : a @entity101 blasted the @entity3 for their controversial gun map the newspaper 's editor and vice president of news , @entity205 , defended the decision to list the permit holders			1
' we knew publication of the database would be controversial , but we felt sharing as much information as we could about gun ownership in our area was important in the aftermath of the @entity177 shootings , ' she said			0
some critics retaliated by posting reporters ' and editors ' addresses and other personal information online			0
@entity221 , a journalism professor at the @entity222 at @entity223 , called the critics ' response childish and petulant			0
' it does n't move the issue of gun control to the level of intelligent public discussion , ' he said			0
' instead , it transforms what should be a rational public debate on a contentious issue into ugly gutter fighting			0
' calling for change : the paper said that they produced the map because in the wake of the @entity177 shooting many people wanted to know who had legal guns in their neighborhood , and there were protests across the country ( pictured )			2
@entity221 said the information about permit holders was public and , if presented in context , served a legitimate interest			0
but media critic @entity251 of the @entity253 - based @entity252 wrote online this week that the newspaper 's reporting had not gone far enough to justify the permit holders ' loss of privacy			0
' if journalists could show flaws in the gun permitting system , that would be newsworthy , ' he said			0
' or , for example , if gun owners were exempted from permits because of political connections , then journalists could better justify the privacy invasion			0
' @entity251 said he feared the dispute might prompt lawmakers to play to privacy fears			0
' the net effect of the abuse of public records from all sides may well be a public distaste for opening records , which would be the biggest mistake of all , ' he said .			0
