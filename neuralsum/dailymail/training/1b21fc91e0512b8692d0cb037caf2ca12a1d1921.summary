@entity1 boss @entity0 has warned the @entity4 's new @entity3 dna programme must not promote a corrosive ' elitism ' in the next generation of players			1
the @entity4 blueprint , which was launched on thursday , calls for joined - up thinking in international player development , from under - 15 level upwards , with youngsters encouraged to buy into ' the @entity3 way ' through initiatives such as digital wristbands for reference			1
but @entity0 is already sceptical about some of the comforts and amenities available to school - age children at @entity21 academies and believes it is important not to wrap the stars of the future in cotton wool from the start			1
@entity1 boss @entity0 is concerned the @entity27 must not promote corrosive ' elitism ' @entity29 scored for @entity0 's team on tuesday night to get a point in a 1 - 1 draw with @entity33 @entity1 face @entity35 's @entity34 on saturday as both teams look to creep out of the relegation zone ' it 's diluting to get this elitism , ' said @entity0			1
' we know they 're going to get enhanced coaching and better facilities at almost every level but you ca n't get so drunk on that that you forget about the passion , pride , belief , desire and will			1
' it 's fair to say this elitist thought does n't guarantee an elite outcome			1
in fact it can take it away			0
' when you get these elitist groups sometimes the rawness of a player is lost and i think they 've got to understand that			0
' it 's not just the technical , tactical , physical ... there still needs to be that rawness and some of the best have got it			2
' they get treated unbelievably well			2
' you get a 14 - year - old needing a rub down before training			0
i ca n't accept that			2
' i spoke to an eight - year - old who told me he had done his hamstring			0
i said , ' i ca n't believe you know what your hamstring is , son			0
now go out there and get running '			0
' people might say it 's an archaic view but i think the moral fibre of footballers is as relevant now as its ever been			0

@entity0 said the @entity87 programme must n't promote a corrosive ' elitism '
the blueprint for the @entity4 's programme was launched on thursday
