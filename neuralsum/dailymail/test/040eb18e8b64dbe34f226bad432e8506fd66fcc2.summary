@entity0 has revealed that @entity2 players will have their salaries slashed by up to 50 per cent if they are relegated			1
the @entity4 are fourth - bottom of the @entity5 with one of the toughest run - ins facing them , and @entity2 manager @entity0 said all players ' contracts have been set up to protect the club financially in the event of relegation			1
@entity2 have the third - lowest total wage bill in the @entity5 , Â£ 43.3million in 2013/14 according to figures filed in @entity15 , with only @entity16 and @entity17 paying less overall			1
@entity4 boss @entity0 has revealed that players will have their salaries cut if they do n't beat the drop @entity2 currently lie in 17th place but have a daunting run - in to survive in the @entity5 @entity0 , speaking ahead of @entity2 's trip to @entity24 on saturday , said : ' we are a newly - promoted club who have been in the @entity5 about 20 months so we always knew we were going to be up against it			1
' everybody concerned takes a huge reduction in salary			0
the club has had a really , really stringent policy so that if we do get relegated the club does n't fall into drastic times which a lot of clubs do			0
' most players take a 40 and 50 per cent reduction in their salary which is key throughout it all			2
so we are all realistic to know that yes we want to avoid going into the @entity42 but we have made sensible provisions , our budget is pretty stringent , so that the club does n't leak into the realms it was before and i think that is very important for a club like ours			0
' @entity0 hopes @entity49 ( centre ) will recover from a training knock to face @entity24 at the weekend @entity0 said battling to avoid such a huge drop in salary should act as a big incentive for his players			1
he added : ' absolutely - i think they need reminding of that ! for a club like ours it 's the right provision			0
' if you get relegated it 's a major overhaul and you basically start over again on your journey , but you want to remain positive and make sure the club does n't go through the horrendous times of four or five years ago before the current owners took over			0
' @entity2 have not won for two months , their last win being a 2 - 1 victory over @entity69 , and desperately need to end the run with matches against @entity72 and @entity73 to come			1
@entity0 's hopes of @entity49 providing a welcome boost on return from a lengthy knee injury have yet to be realised however , and the @entity79 midfielder again complained of pain in his knee in training this week			1
' he has been out for five months and he is still not 100 per cent , ' said @entity0			2
' and we know that if you are not 100 per cent you can not perform in this league			0
' it 's a crying shame as we have missed him			0
' @entity0 has praised the job done by @entity88 , and before him @entity89 ( right ) , at @entity90 @entity0 hopes the fact @entity24 have little to play for will go in @entity2 's favour but is taking nothing for granted given the turnaround at the @entity24 performed by @entity88 and before him @entity89			1
' a big pat of the back deserves to go to @entity88 and @entity97 , ' @entity0 said			2
' only 18 months ago everyone thought they were a goner			0
' @entity101 ( ankle ) and @entity103 ( thigh ) are still out for @entity2 while @entity106 's badly broken nose makes him a doubt .			2
