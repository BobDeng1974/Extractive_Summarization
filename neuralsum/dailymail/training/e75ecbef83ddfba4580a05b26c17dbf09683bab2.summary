however pleasing the updated @entity2 table may have been for @entity3 on sunday evening , he scarcely required smelling salts to revive him for the short taxi ride from @entity6 to @entity7			1
as one of @entity12 ’s most celebrated graduates of recent times , the @entity9 midfielder has long been able to testify that nothing at the @entity16 club happens completely by chance			1
if there ’s every possibility that the 1 - 0 victory at @entity22 which took @entity12 back to the summit of @entity25 football will be a short - lived pinnacle for @entity28 ’s side , then who would bet against the newly - promoted outfit yet finishing in the top six or possibly troubling the @entity31 places ? @entity12 beat champions @entity32 at @entity22 , something that has n't happened for 76 years since an opening - day wobble at home to @entity36 , @entity12 have now gone 10 games in all competitions without defeat			1
@entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 and now @entity32 are among the sides lying in their wake with not a hard - luck story between them			1
those who once questioned the benefit the top division would gain from a team with a fan - base edging into four figures have long since been silenced			1
the real beauty of @entity12 ’s success is its simplicity			1
a policy of augmenting an experienced spine with their finest youth players is n’t just proving successful – it ’s also self - funding			2
@entity3 ’s initial £ 500,000 fee to @entity63 has recently been topped up by a generous slice of the £ 7million @entity9 subsequently paid for him this summer			1
likewise , @entity66 ’s initial £ 1.2m switch to @entity63 and his £ 13m move to @entity68 plus @entity70 ’s £ 350,000 switch to @entity71			2
so much for provincial clubs being unable to turn a coin @entity73			0
@entity3 said he was very proud of his former side , who now top the @entity2 the conveyer belt just keeps turning			1
@entity78 , @entity79 and @entity80 are just a few of the names seemingly destined for bigger things as direct a result of being regularly exposed to the demands of the professional game from a young age			0
‘ it has been amazing , ’ said @entity3 with no little understatement			1
‘ @entity28 has done a remarkable job in the time he has been involved			2
@entity90 needs to get credit , as well , because he took these kids , nurtured them and brought them through			0
@entity28 took it on from there			0
‘ giving players a chance is the reason why they ’ve done so well			0
you look at the boys who are there - they have not just become good players this year			2
they ’ve played 80 - 100 games and learned a way of playing			1
‘ when you play reserve football , you do n’t get as much out of it			0
you only learn so much			0
they are getting the chance to learn the right way and when you need to go and win a first - team match , you are playing for your career , really			2
‘ @entity12 are a prime example ... not of the way @entity25 football has to go , but in the way they are producing young talent			1
i think that ’s good for the @entity117 national team , as well			0
’ from his own perspective , @entity3 finds it impossible to underplay the role the club played in making him into an @entity123 player with international credentials			1
the @entity9 midfielder 's recent transfers have brought considerable sums of money to his old club asked bluntly if he ’d be weighing up the possibility of playing against @entity131 on saturday had he started out elsewhere , he replied : ‘ i do n’t think i would be			1
i really believe that being at a club like @entity12 and getting that chance to progress is vital			1
‘ if you were at another club , you might not get that chance			2
you play reserve football and do n’t progress as fast			0
i owe a lot personally to @entity12			1
‘ i played quite a lot of games and the boys there now have done that , as well , and you learn from playing games			2
‘ from a personal point of view , i would n’t have changed anything – i would always have wanted to be at a club like @entity12			1
it ’s a small club but it ’s run so well			2
they are such a good club – everyone is so close			2
‘ but they deserve that ( financial rewards ) , not only for our transfers but for the work they are doing behind the scenes			0
starting kids at a young , young age takes time and money and they will continue to progress as a club			1
’ perhaps it was the loyalty that @entity12 seem to instil in their players that led to @entity3 thinking twice when @entity63 ’s own story turned sour a year ago			1
@entity3 playing for @entity12 before his move to @entity63 in 2010 relegation – even if it did come on the back of an @entity170 – might have been the signal for key players to agitate but a sense of personal responsibility kicked in			1
‘ it ’s where everyone wants to be , ’ the 27 - year - old said of the top division			1
‘ but i wanted to stay with @entity63 last year and get the club back into the @entity123 because i was part of the team that went down so was partly to blame when they got relegated			2
‘ everyone had to take their share of responsibility for that so i wanted to stay and try to get them promoted			0
‘ it did n’t work out like that			0
i wanted to give it a year and an opportunity came to get back in the @entity123 and i ’m happy it went through			0
’ @entity3 ’s contentment at his new club is understandable			1
as @entity9 ’s record signing , he was the man the incoming @entity198 was prepared to move heaven and earth to land on deadline day			1
two defeats in six matches suggest the disquiet that engulfed the club following @entity207 ’s shock departure has long blown over			2
@entity3 is enjoying playing for @entity198 at @entity9 , he was @entity198 's highest transfer priority ‘ it ’s been brilliant , ’ he added			1
‘ the lads are great and we ’ve done fine as well , which makes it more enjoyable as well			0
the manager is very good			0
i ’m happy because he signed me but he keeps everybody in high spirits and is a good laugh			0
he ’s got us organised and we are getting results from it			0
‘ he has got a funny side to him and that ’s good because managers can be too serious sometimes			0
‘ he builds a happiness in the camp and everyone feeds off that , but when it ’s time to do business , he is ready to work hard			2
’ as was pointed out to him , he might as well have been talking about @entity229			0
also a man who preaches the importance of ensuring the whole of greater than the sum of the parts in any team , the @entity117 manager is a stated admirer of @entity3			1
at @entity239 on saturday , though , dilemmas abound			0
@entity240 may be missing but the return of @entity242 , the continuing presence of @entity244 and the omnipresent @entity245 make central midfield places hard to come by			0
@entity229 's @entity117 side face @entity131 and @entity248 in the next @entity250 qualifiers ‘ it ’s not just the midfield – all the way through the squad there ’s competition , ’ @entity3 continued			1
‘ it ’s the best squad i ’ve been involved with			0
it ’s getting harder and harder for the manager to pick the team			0
that can only be a good thing			0
’ whatever side @entity229 does select , and no matter the pre-match platitudes , @entity131 at home has ‘ must win ’ stamped all over it			0
that sense of injustice felt by all in the immediate aftermath of a narrow defeat to @entity270 was all very well but only by making an authoritative start to the first home match will the sense of belief continue			2
‘ i think we take a hell of a lot from that performance , ’ @entity3 reflected ‘ we were playing against the world champions and we ran them very close			1
‘ we want to win every game and we will go into this one trying to get three points as we do in every match			0
we believe we can do that so we ’ll try our best			0

first time @entity12 had won at @entity22 in 76 years
