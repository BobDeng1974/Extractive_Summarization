by @entity0 @entity3 's drought could last years longer and cost the state $ 2.2billion , scientists have warned			1
they say the devastating drought , one of the worst ever recorded , probably wo n't finish until the end of next year at the earliest and has already cost 17,100 farm jobs			1
the stark warning comes after residents increased their water use this year - despite $ 500 - a - day fines being approved yesterday			1
and things could get worse still , as the experts warned the state 's groundwater reserves are fast being used up			1
the stricken state 's drought could last years longer and cost $ 2.2billion , scientists have warned - including 17,100 jobs fallout : the conditions make fires more likely and could get worse as groundwater reserves are sucked dry the study by the @entity32 , found the catastrophic three - year drought is responsible for the greatest water loss ever seen in @entity3 's agriculture			1
river levels are being replaced by pumping in groundwater at twice the normal rate in some areas - which could cause a crisis in itself			1
@entity41 in the @entity42 north west of @entity43 are already in danger of running dry soon and many more could follow			0
report author @entity45 slammed the state 's lack of groundwater checks as a ' slow - moving train wreck ' , warning reserves underground are being used like an ' unlimited savings account '			1
he said : ' the problem is that @entity3 is [ in a position ] almost uniquely in the western states of not measuring our groundwater			2
no food : a horse in a field in @entity60 , @entity3			0
worst - hit areas are losing more than half their fallow crops ' so we 're like somebody who 's so rich they do n't have to balance our checkbook			2
we 're walking around signing checks and not even balancing the checkbook because we still think we are in a groundwater - rich era			1
' @entity3 is the only state without a framework for groundwater management , the report said			2
the researchers added : ' if the drought continues for two more years , groundwater reserves will continue to be used to replace surface water losses			1
reservoir name - % full ( july average ) exchequer - 24 % ( 36 % ) @entity78 - 25 % ( 40 % ) @entity79 - 27 % ( 40 % ) new @entity80 - 28 % ( 45 % ) @entity81 - 38 % ( 50 % ) @entity82 - 39 % ( 50 % ) source : @entity84 ' pumping ability will slowly decrease , while costs and losses will slowly increase due to groundwater depletion			1
' the report claimed this year alone , drought has cost @entity3 's agriculture 3 per cent of its entire value			1
this equates to $ 1.5billion - $ 1billion in lost income and and $ 0.5billion in pumping costs			1
once industries that depend on farming are taken into account , this rises to $ 2.2 billion across the state			1
one in 20 of the state 's crop fields - 428,000 acres - have been ruined in the worst - hit @entity103 as well as @entity104 and @entity3			2
the study added the drought is ' likely to continue through 2015 ' , despite the possible effects of the @entity109 weather system			2
but the factor hitting people worst on the ground is the loss of jobs			2
around 17,100 have disappeared , 3.8 per cent of all farm unemployment , according to the report			2
mr @entity45 , a professor emeritus of farming economics , added : ' these are mostly seasonal jobs but they 're seasonal and full - time , and they 're from a sector of the population who have the least ability to roll with the punches			1
' running out : current water levels in @entity3 's main reservoirs , with the central area the worst - hit desolate : with the drought now in its third year , farmhouses are surrounded by brown , barren hills ranchers have begun selling their livestock in droves to ranchers in the northwestern states of the @entity139 the report was partly funded by the state 's agriculture and water resources departments , and was released just hours before state regulators considered rolling out tighter - still rules on water use			1
it used computer models , satellite data from @entity150 and the latest estimates of the @entity152 , federal @entity153 and local water deliveries and groundwater pumping capacities			0
' the 2014 drought is responsible for the greatest absolute reduction in water availability for @entity3 agriculture ever seen , ' read the report			0
crisis : @entity3 governor @entity162 declared a state of emergency last january ' these results ... underscore @entity3 's heavy reliance on groundwater to cope with droughts			0
without replenishing groundwater in wet years , water tables fall and both reduce regional pumping capacity and increase pumping energy costs			0
' @entity174 governor @entity162 declared the state 's drought to be an emergency last january			0
the state has already put millions towards stricken communities and eased protections for endangered fish to allow pumping from the fragile @entity182			0
despite the moves , some areas are seeing more than half their crops die			0
ranchers have begun selling their livestock in droves to ranchers in the northwestern states of the @entity139 most of the 17,100 lost jobs , including seasonal and part - time agriculture work , are in the @entity194			1
@entity195 , secretary of the @entity196 , said residents had to ' develop an ethic of conservation '			0
they must ' embrace recycling of water , capturing stormwater [ and ] investing in storage , whether its above ground or below ground , ' she said			0
@entity207 , director of the university 's @entity208 , added : ' all the climate change studies that we 've done , we do n't see catastrophe if we manage it well , but we do see inconvenience and we do see costs			0
' @entity3 produces nearly half of @entity139 - grown fruits , nuts and vegetables and nearly a quarter of the nation ’s milk and cream			0
across the nation , consumers regularly buy several crops grown almost entirely in @entity3 , including tomatoes , carrots , broccoli , almonds , walnuts , grapes , olives and figs. poignant : the grass has even died in the @entity234 , @entity22			0
@entity3 produces nearly half of @entity139 - grown fruits , nuts and vegetables and nearly a quarter of the nation ¿ s milk and cream			0
shock : some residents have continued using their sprinklers despite the threat of $ 500 - a - day fines but despite the devastation , the report said consumer food prices will be largely unaffected			1
higher prices of high - value @entity3 crops like nuts , wine grapes and dairy foods are driven more by market demand than by the drought , it said			2
' @entity3 ’s agricultural economy overall is doing remarkably well , thanks mostly to groundwater reserves , ' said @entity207 , a co-author of the study and director of the university ’s @entity208			0
' but we expect substantial local and regional economic and employment impacts			0
we need to treat that groundwater well so it will be there for future droughts			0

@entity269 warning issued by experts at the @entity32
they say drought will almost certainly continue throughout next year
this year alone , drought has cost $ 2.2bn and removed 17,100 farming jobs
too much groundwater being pumped , causing a ' slow - moving train wreck '
and @entity281 are still using sprinklers despite $ 500 - a - day fines
