@entity1 @entity0 , 31 , and her friend were driving down a three - lane @entity4 interstate in 2012 when her steering wheel began to lock up			1
the car 's engine stopped and @entity0 's friend had to push the car to the side of the highway to avoid being hit			2
@entity0 told the @entity12 that the car 's shutdown was n't due to a mechanical failure -- it was her auto lender			2
@entity0 's story is similar to that of many people who have borrowed from auto lenders that utilize what are called ' @entity22			1
' these devices enable auto lenders to prevent a borrower 's car from starting with the push of a button , according to the @entity12			1
starter @entity22 : these devices emit flashing lights , beeping noises and then shuts down the car and prevents it from starting if a borrower misses an auto payment , lenders may activate a device installed in the car in an attempt to ' remind ' the borrower to make the payment			1
the device emits flashing lights , loud beeping noises and may even prevent the car from starting			1
the @entity12 reports that the devices are being utilized for many borrowers with credit scores 640 or below			0
the devices are said to be a way to help repair poor credit and encourage borrowers to consistently make payments on time , according to the @entity12			0
@entity52 , executive vice president of @entity54 , one company that makes starter interrupt devices , said the devices are a ' tough love approach ' to helping borrowers make their payments on time			1
' we want to help [ borrowers ] get on their feet , ' sailors told the @entity12 , ' but sometimes it does require a very consistent reminder and in some cases the disablement of the start of their vehicle if they have n't made their payment on time			0
' borrowers with a credit score at or below 640 are considered ' subprime , ' and the @entity12 reports that roughly 25 percent of auto loans made last year were considered subprime			0
starter interrupt only : many starter interrupt device manufacturers like @entity80 and @entity54 say the devices do not shut down moving vehicles , but prevent them from starting the @entity12 refers to this as the ' subprime boom ' and the devices enable lenders to give auto loans to high - risk borrowers			1
so , borrowers can get auto loans a little easier , but not without having one of these devices installed in their vehicles , ultimately giving lenders final control			2
the @entity12 reports that these devices have been installed in more than two million vehicles			2
the @entity12 tells of lender @entity96 , the head of collections at @entity100 in @entity101 , @entity102 , who has once even ' disabled a car while [ he ] was shopping at @entity104			0
' the @entity12 reports that @entity96 can monitor more than 800 borrowers at a time via a computerized map that uses a red marker to show the borrower 's locations			2
easy loans : borrowers can get auto loans a little easier , but not without having a starter interrupt device installed in their vehicles , ultimately giving len ( stock image ) @entity96 can spot borrowers on the map who have not made their payments and remotely shut down their vehicles at any time			1
@entity96 told the times that using the device ' gets [ borrower 's ] attention			0
' though the device 's purpose is to ultimately benefit borrowers , many have reported lenders shutting down their vehicles at inconvenient times			0
many state laws prohibit lenders from seizing cars until the borrowers are in default , which means they have not made a payment in at least 30 days , the @entity12 reports			0
many starter interrupt device manufacturers like @entity80 , which @entity0 had in her car , and @entity54 say the devices do not shut down moving vehicles , but prevent them from starting			1
@entity0 told the @entity12 that her auto lender 's ( @entity145 ) use of the device made her feel helpless			0
' i felt like even though i made my payments and was never late under my contract , these people could do whatever they wanted , ' @entity0 said , ' and there was nothing i could do to stop them			0

@entity1 @entity0 had to have her car pushed out of on - coming *traffic*
