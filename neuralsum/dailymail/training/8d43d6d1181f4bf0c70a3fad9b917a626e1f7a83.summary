' with no prospect of youngsters finding a home they can call their own			0
one of the ways out of this , difficult though it is in beautiful parts of the country , is to build more homes on the scale we need			2

he said the party would spell out how it would be funded closer to the time of the general election next may			0
' my challenge to @entity158 and the @entity159 is if you are not going to do this , what are you going to cut ? are you going to cut money to colleges ? are you going to cut apprentices ? are you going to cut help for toddlers ? ' i think it would be unimaginable for us as a country , having made these steps , to reverse them			0

mr @entity2 also announced plans to protect the education budget ' from cradle to college ' during the next @entity185			2
but the @entity119 leader could not say how he would fund the £ 10 billion pledge			1
the move is designed to win back support lost over the failure to honour his 2010 election promise to scrap tuition fees @entity193 and @entity2 sparked fury in @entity195 after meeting @entity197 's spiritual leader the @entity196 in 2012 deputy prime minister @entity2 this morning risked a fresh diplomatic rift with @entity195 after defending his decision to meet @entity197 's spiritual leader the @entity196 - while also attacking the country 's human right 's record			1
his controversial intervention , at his monthly press conference this morning , came on the first morning of a three - day visit to @entity112 by @entity195 's premier @entity207			2
mr @entity2 said he had ' no regrets at all ' that he met the @entity196 with @entity193 in 2012			0

he said : ' for me it ’s just self - evidently not the case that you can claim that what ’s happening in @entity235 , never mind any other country , is separated from a massive military invasion of that country just 11 years ago			0
