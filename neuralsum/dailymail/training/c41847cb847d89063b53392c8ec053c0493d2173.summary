the @entity0 claims a months - long undercover investigation of two roadside zoo 's has found shocking abuse and neglect of exotic animals kept for profit			1
the @entity7 revealed their findings on thursday which focus on what they call the persistent mistreatment of four tiger cubs and neglect that led to the death of a 24 - year - old giraffe after she had given birth to twins			1
the @entity0 conducted the investigations at @entity20 in @entity21 and @entity22 in @entity23 and found that cubs were punched and hit from three - weeks old to condition them for paying customers to have their photographs taken with them			1
another witnessed was a spider monkey with a bone - deep hand wound - that apparently was not treated for weeks paying public : the financial incentives for the two roadside zoo 's owners are great			0
they can charge anywhere from $ 50 to $ 1,000 for a photo shoot with a tiger cub the @entity7 investigation also found a critical lack of veterinary care , crowded conditions and filthy cages , among other unsafe conditions			2
the undercover @entity7 members embedded themselves as staff at the two facilities and claim they witnessed the deaths of animals through willful mismanagement			1
the deaths included a baby camel who accidentally hung herself through neglect , a capuchin monkey who mistakenly ate rat poison and died and saw sick guinea pigs killed by slamming them into the ground			0
they also found a spider monkey with a bone - deep hand wound and a lone elephant who is locked away in a dark barn when she is n't giving rides to the public			0
dragged : in footage shot secretly and supplied by the @entity7 a white tiger cub called @entity86 appears to be pulled along the ground against its will accused : the @entity20 in @entity21 and the @entity22 in @entity23 had employees with the @entity7 secretly join their staff for months last year struck : in this clip a woman is heard to call the tiger cub a ' b * * * * ' for biting her and then what follows appears to be a slap discipline : another white tiger cub is hit on the nose while inside a small cage by one of his handlers @entity103 , who is the president and ceo of the @entity0 has called for the @entity106 @entity105 to revoke both the zoo 's licenses and for @entity23 and @entity21 to press cruelty to animal charges			1
according to the @entity113 , both their investigations witnessed how each zoo ran a profitable business out of using their tiger cubs for photo shoots with the public			1
the fees charges would vary between $ 50 to $ 1,000 per session			0
in a written response to the @entity123 , @entity22 owner @entity121 called the allegations ' slanderous ' and ' vicious propaganda ' aimed at soliciting donations			2
he also denied the accusations			0
@entity20 has yet to respond to the allegations			2
footage recorded in secret by the @entity0 revealed the tiger cubs squealing in distress during these photo shoots and apparently being hit , punched , slapped and choked as discipline for misbehaving			1
the @entity0 also alleges that the four cubs were taken away from their mothers just after being born and hand reared instead			0
smiles : this family have a picture taken with an elephant at one of the two facilities : the @entity7 allege that one of the elephants at the two roadside zoos are locked away in a dark room after entertaining the public trust : this elephant is charged with giving rides to children around one of the grounds where mistreatment is alleged the undercover investigation also claims in some instances that @entity20 and @entity22 put their cubs up for public handling when they were only three or four weeks old			1
indeed , the @entity0 also claims that the public are being exposed to potentially dangerous illnesses through the facilities mishandling of the tigers			0
one particular allegation is that a three - week - old tiger cub with ringworm was handled by 27 people after being transported to @entity20 in a 19 - hour car journey from @entity170			1
another , white tiger cub called @entity172 was seen to be dragged , punched and slapped by his handler at @entity20 and on one day forced to do 60 photo sessions with the paying public			0
lurking in the background and a common domininator between both @entity20 and @entity22 according to @entity0 is a group called @entity180 , which is based in @entity181 , @entity170			2
tragic : allegedly one capuchin monkey ate rat poison at one of the two facilities and later died it is run by a man named @entity188 , who is known as a kingpin of the exotic animal trading world according to the @entity113			0
according to the @entity0 , ' @entity191 gives and takes cubs from both @entity22 and @entity20			1
we do n't know if any money changes hands â€“ it 's a secretive business and , unbelievably , these animals are bred indiscriminately all over the country and not tracked by any one agency for their lifetimes			0
' @entity200 , executive director and ceo of the @entity202 told the @entity0 : ' it appears that both operations are typical roadside zoos with amateur , reckless and harsh captive conditions and treatment			2
