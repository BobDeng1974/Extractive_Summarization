when @entity1 nodded home in @entity4 's 5 - 1 hammering of world champions @entity6 on friday , the striker would n't have realised he had just created a new viral sensation			1
' planking ' was forced to sit on the back burner , as ' @entity10 ' took over @entity11			2
it involves @entity4 fans copying the @entity16 striker 's flying header from the comfort of their own back gardens			1
they never looked back from then on , as @entity20 added another with @entity47 scoring twice and @entity48 bagging the fifth			0
it got new @entity16 manager @entity35 's tournament off to a flying start - quite literally - as his term with @entity4 comes to an end once the @entity29 is over			0
the flying @entity53 : @entity20 soars in the air as he equalises for @entity4 against @entity6 race : @entity20 made his way to the dugout to celebrate with new @entity16 manager @entity58 high five : @entity58 and @entity20 celebrate the goal together and will hope to do so more at @entity61			0

@entity1 equalised against @entity6 with a *superb* flying header in their 5 - 1 win
fans take to @entity11 to show off their own version of ' @entity10 '
