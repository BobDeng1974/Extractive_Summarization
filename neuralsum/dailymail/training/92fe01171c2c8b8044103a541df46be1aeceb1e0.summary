by @entity0 published : 08:33 est , 31 may 2012 updated : 12:38 est , 31 may 2012 while most may see the local public pool as a respite from the summer heat , one in five sees it as a bathroom			0
a shocking new survey claims that a full 20 per cent of those swimming and splashing about also relieve themselves in it			1
furthermore , red - eyes that often associated with a day at the pool are from chloramine , the chemical created when urine combines with the chlorine that 's already in the pool , not from the water treatment chemical			1
jumping in : a survey shows that one out of five adults pees in the pool the survey was conducted by the @entity22 and @entity23 , and reveals a number of statistics that may make pool - goers think twice before diving in			1
while it did not exhaustively look into the reasons behind why people think they can urinate in a public pool , the survey suggests that it is easy and anonymous			1
however , dr @entity33 , who serves as chair of the @entity22 and @entity23 said that is the wrong way to think			1
‘ no matter how easy it is to pee anonymously in the pool , swimmers should avoid doing so and take their children on frequent bathroom breaks , ’ he said			0
dr @entity33 also places responsibility on those working at the pool , adding : ‘ pool operators should also monitor and maintain proper pool water chemistry , especially ph and chlorine levels			2
’ according to the @entity51 , it is the ‘ first defence against germs that can make swimmers sick			1
’ but the cringe - worthy results do n’t stop there – the survey reveals that nearly 70 per cent of people taking a dip do not shower beforehand			1
human slurry : moreover , 70 per cent of people said they did n't shower before taking a dip @entity62 said that while it may seem counter-intuitive or redundant to rinse off before jumping in the pool , it is essential for the health of all of those around			1
while this may seem harmless , people who enter the pool without showering are essentially treating the pool as a communal bath , the study says			0
when things like makeup , sunscreen , bug spray , perfume , deodorant , sweat , and dirt that , mix with chlorine and other pool chemicals , they can cause significant irritation			0
according to the @entity51 , many diseases spread through pool because people do not shower before jumping in , bringing dirt , sweat , and sunscreen into the water with them			1
everyone planning to take a plunge should first shower - a simple 15 to 30 second rinse is all it takes			2
those who are sick or have diarrhea should also avoid the pool to avoid transmitting diseases by the water			2
adults should use the restroom once every hour , and those with children should follow the same rules			2
children 's diapers should be checked every 30 - 60 minutes			0
if a pool has a ripe or pungent smell , it should ostensibly be avoided , as chemically balanced pools emit no odour			2
the report says that the famous ‘ pool smell ’ results not from the chlorine , but from the slurry of water impurities swimmers bring in by not showering reacting with the pool ’s chemicals			2
that is to say , the more strong - smelling a pool is , the more contaminated it is as well			0
@entity62 notes that a well - maintained pool with the proper ph balance has no discernible odour			0
@entity127 , the chief of @entity51 ’s @entity128 told @entity129 that urine in the water creates two problems			1
‘ the first is that the urine eats up the chlorine to kill the germs , ’ she said			0
‘ the other problem is that urine contains nitrogen – like personal care products – which create chloramine			0
’ @entity140 , a combination of chlorine and ammonia , is what causes itchy red eyes after a swim , not the chlorine that is used to treat the water			2
she continued : ‘ a healthy pool does n’t smell – the smell is coming from the personal care products mixing with the chlorine			0
’ ms @entity127 , an rn with a @entity155 , offered several tips for safe swimming			1
‘ it ’s really important for swimmers to take bathroom breaks regularly once and hour , ’ she said , adding that children ’s diapers should be checked once every 30 to 60 minutes			0
but the crux of the matter is simple			0
‘ it ’s all about good hygiene , ’ ms @entity127 said			0
‘ even just rinsing in water for 15 or 30 seconds gets ride of the personal care products			0
’ in an effort to make the public aware of the importance of good poolside hygiene , the @entity51 expert said education is key			1
‘ another step , ’ she said , ‘ is the @entity177			0
the @entity51 is developing this resource for state and local health departments of model standards , ’ as there is no federal regulatory authority responsible for disinfected water parks and pools			1
the @entity187 includes rethinking the design of locker rooms and pool houses so that swimmers pass the showers before entering the pool , and making warm water readily available so there are no intended cold showers before a relaxing dip on a hot day .			1

survey by @entity22 and @entity23 reveals one in five adults urinate in swimming pools
seven in ten also admit they do n't shower before taking a dip
@entity51 offers tips on staying safe in the water
