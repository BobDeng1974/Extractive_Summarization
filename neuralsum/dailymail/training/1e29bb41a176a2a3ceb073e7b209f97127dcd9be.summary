by @entity0 published : 11:21 est , 27 october 2013 updated : 10:20 est , 28 october 2013 @entity2 , 22 , believes she would have longer to life if doctors had been able to find her more suitable liver and bone marrow transplants a 22 - year - old who has been battling leukaemia for six years has said her ill health could have been prevented if more people were registered as donors			1
@entity14 of @entity15 believes she would have longer to live if doctors had been able to find her a suitable bone marrow match when she was 16			1
@entity2 , who was forced to undergo a second transplant and liver replacement in later years , is now unsure if she will see her 23rd birthday in january			1
after being diagnosed with the disease , @entity2 's older sister stepped in to donate her own bone marrow , a move which was boosted by chemotherapy			1
but after several months the teenager 's health continued to deteriorate			2
' i found lumps in my face which turned out to be malignant tumours , and tests revealed that my bone marrow was full of cancer again , ' she recalls			1
she required a second transplant from a donor in @entity37 , after which doctors told her she had a 20 per cent chance at life			0
though she surpassed doctor 's expectations , @entity2 discovered she had developed graft - versus - host - virus disease ( @entity45 ) shortly after the second operation			2
' this is when the donor cells recognise the recipient 's cells as foreign and they attack ' , she explains			0
' it can happen in any of the systems of the body , and i 've had it almost everywhere			0
' i had it in my skin and my digestive system , but it was treated with several weeks of iv steroids			0
after receiving a bone marrow transplant from her sister @entity62 in 2008 and undergoing chemotherapy , doctors were hopeful @entity2 would make a recovery @entity2 recalls how her skin turned yellow with jaundice as she was in desperate need of a new liver ' then in the september i got it in my eyes			1
i lived in the dark for a month because it made me incredibly photophobic			0
' it was eventually treated with eye drops made from stem cells from my own blood ' as a result , @entity2 was hospitalised on @entity79 - and did not return home until june the following year			1
@entity2 has undergone rounds of chemotherapy as well as the transplants throughout her six - year battle it was during this time she received a liver transplant			1
but , as she was in such bad health , doctors selected an organ of a different blood type to try to keep her alive			0
though the operation , which took place on december 21 , was a success , experts did n't believe the teenager would be alive at @entity96			0
' my donor was a different blood type to me - i was a-positive , but i received an o - negative liver because i was so poorly			2
' while the haematology doctors were still monitoring me , they discovered an anomaly in one of my test results - the dna in my bone marrow had changed			1
' it was n't me			0
neither was it my sister , nor the @entity37 donor			0
' what happened was that the stem cells from the liver had travelled to my bone marrow , kicked out the @entity37 and set up shop			1
' i had effectively had a third accidental bone marrow transplant - i 'm the only person in the world for all this to happen to			1
' there 's a scientific paper being written about me			0
' as more @entity45 spread through her body , @entity2 's lung capacity reduced to just 50 to 60 per cent , and she was forced to start using a wheelchair			2
@entity2 stunned experts by reaching her 21st birthday last year after being told she only had a 20 per cent chance of survival ' this was n't such a problem when my new liver was working fine			1
but in 2011 i got biliary stones			0
they 're basically the same as gallstones			0
' though this was temporarily resolved with the creation of a new bile duct , @entity2 's liver is now failing to drain properly , causing infection which is resistant to antibiotics			2
as such , her only hope of survival is a new liver transplant - a prospect which is becoming less likely as her respiratory function continues to falter			2
last year @entity2 was told it would be too much of a risk to her health to perform a second liver transplant @entity2 recalls the moment doctors told her she was n't eligible for a second transplant as the procedure would involve too much risk , describing the news as ' like being punched in the face '			2
' it was decided that i could n't have a transplant because they would probably not be able to get me off the ventilator post-surgery - and that 's if i survived the operation at all			2
' speaking of her family 's reaction to the life - threatening news , she said : ' we know everything is not going to be all right , but for now we are just carrying on the best we can			2
' though heartbroken , the 22 - year - old says she is ' not surprised ' by doctor 's decisions as there merely are n't enough people willing to donate organs or bone marrow			1
' i am going to die because not enough people are on the donor registers			0
' one in three people die while on the waiting list for an organ , and it is so unnecessary			0
' people die because they ca n't find suitable bone marrow donors , and that should n't happen when signing up and donating is so easy - no one has to die to donate bone marrow like they do with an organ			1
' i have been to too many funerals that could have been prevented if more people were on the registers			0
' as well as a trip to @entity192 and celebrating @entity96 , @entity2 wishes to use her remaining time ' spreading the word about organ and bone marrow donation '			1
' i have things i want to do , i do n't want to go before i 've done them			0
the 22 - year - old has said she will spend her remaining time campaigning for bone marrow donation so others do n't find themselves in her situation ' i want to try and stop this from happening to anyone else , ' she said , adding : ' so many people " mean to do it " , but never do - and it is so simple			1
' ' i want to get to @entity96 and my birthday but i do n't know what 's going to happen			0
and @entity209 , i am so scared			0
' @entity2 has been documenting her condition and campaign for bone marrow and organ donation awareness on her blog which has received 5,000 views in just six days .			1

@entity14 has been battling leukaemia since she was 16
after undergoing two bone marrow transplants , a liver replacement and chemotherapy @entity2 has just months to live
