@entity13 deficiency is a genetic condition which is passed down through families			1
for a child to be born with it , both of their parents have to be carriers of the condition			2
it is characterised by susceptibility to both bacterial and viral infections			1
because a patient ’s immune system is unable to deal with infections , they have to be given regular antibiotics			2
the only potential cure is a bone marrow transplant and , for @entity7 , it is vital a donor is found before she succumbs to an infection			1
@entity7 also has mycobacterium malmoense which is an opportunistic infection which is usually treated with antituberculosis drugs			1
however , these are of limited effectiveness			0

it was about a year before doctors were finally able to establish the cause of her problems			0
