by @entity0 published : 06:20 est , 1 january 2013 updated : 19:16 est , 1 january 2013 message : care minister @entity2 says that some pensioners have a dismal existence and @entity5 must build a less neglectful society neglect by families and neighbours is to blame for elderly people having to endure dismal lives in care homes , the minister in charge of social care has said			1
@entity2 said older @entity5 could lead independent lives at home , if only they had more support from relatives			1
instead , many are never visited at home and are ‘ pushed ’ into care , mr @entity2 said			1
the @entity25 mp ’s comments came as @entity26 warned it was ‘ critical ’ that legislation was introduced to improve the lives of older people			1
mr @entity2 ’s criticism of ‘ neglectful ’ families was met by an angry response from @entity33 , which accused the @entity35 minister of dismissing the many carers who voluntarily look after loved ones			1
the minister urged local authorities to rebuild ‘ neighbourly resilience ’ to stop old people leading lonely lives , instead of expecting the state to ‘ do everything ’			0
this would also reduce the burden on the state as fewer people would need to be housed in residential care			2
mr @entity2 said : ‘ we all have a part to play			1
‘ in this way , we can make the system sustainable , and it can be a more decent society , a less neglectful society than we sometimes experience where we just expect the state to do everything			1
’ he suggested that more could be done to stop the elderly from going in to homes			0
‘ the system pushes them there , ’ he said			0
‘ the system does not do enough to help them maintain their independence			0
’ mr @entity2 added : ‘ with the right support and the right community resilience , and a rebuilding of the neighbour support that used to be there , more people could stay in their own homes for longer			1
’ @entity5 had ‘ lost the extended family because families have become dispersed ’ , he said			2
‘ if someone is living on their own never seeing anyone , that is a dismal existence , and it often ends up with it all collapsing and them going into a care home			2
‘ give them support , some companionship , and help them maintain activity in mind and body and everyone benefits			0
’ he suggested that more councils should follow the example of @entity91 , where elderly people are given grants so that they can adapt their homes to stay living in them independently			0
@entity95 , @entity33 ’s spokesman for care and older people said : ‘ @entity5 ’s six million unpaid family carers are n’t being neglectful of their loved ones and they do n’t expect the state to do everything – far from it			1
‘ they look after their frail elderly and disabled relatives day in day out , often with precious little help and support			0
‘ instead of blaming families for the care crisis , the government should be facing up to its responsibilities by putting in place a decent and fair system for funding social care now and in future			2
’ mr @entity2 also confirmed that the government would announce a cap on care fees , expected to be around £ 75,000 , above which the state will pay			1
warning : the elderly are ending up in care too easily people should be more ' neighbourly ' so they can stay in their own homes , mr @entity2 said however , he warned that the new funding agreement was ‘ not a panacea ’ and ‘ does not remove all financial pressures ’ as people would still have to pay for the accommodation component of living in a care home			1
currently , anyone with assets of more than £ 23,500 faces unlimited charges			0
critics warn that with middle - class couples facing a total outlay of as much as £ 200,000 , many elderly people may still be forced to sell their homes even with the new cap			2
age @entity26 urged the government to adopt new legislation in order to improve the lives of the elderly			0
the campaign group called for a flat basic state pension and for older people in care to be treated with dignity			2
the call for action by the government follows a recent report by a commission looking into dignity in care which said old people were patronised in care homes and often treated as a medical condition rather than as a person			0
in a statement , @entity26 said : ‘ we must make sure older people are supported to live happy and healthy lives through equal access to appropriate prevention , treatment and rehabilitation services			0
‘ we need to work together to ensure that they are supported to meet their aspirations and to live rewarding later lives			0

@entity2 says @entity5 needs a ' less neglectful society '
@entity25 says cap on care fees will be announced this month
