by @entity0 using a first - class stamp to send a letter is a waste of time most of the time , a postal economist has warned			1
they are extremely useful for last - minute birthday cards , but most people should not ‘ bother ’ using them with other mail because so few letters are time sensitive nowadays			1
@entity12 , an independent expert , also said @entity14 ’s crucial ‘ universal service obligation ’ will not survive for another five years			1
economist @entity12 said people should not ‘ bother ’ using first - class stamps because so few letters are time sensitive nowadays			1
he also said @entity14 ’s ‘ universal service obligation ’ will not survive another five years at present , the postal giant must deliver letters to @entity22 ’s 29 million addresses six days a week for the same price whether it is going to the @entity25 highlands or the @entity27 coast			1
a first class stamp , which costs 62p , means it must be delivered on the next working day			0
a second class stamp , which costs 53p , must arrive within three working days			0
@entity14 is legally obliged to achieve this target for first class post 93 per cent of the time , although this rule is scrapped at @entity36 time every year due to the huge increase in post			1
mr @entity12 added : for your birthday cards , that [ a first class stamp ] is fine			2
but , for everything else , do n’t bother			0
‘ anybody who buys a first - class stamp in a book of stamps is doing it for birthday cards they have to send and for no other reason			1
’ when @entity14 boss @entity51 was asked recently about the last letter she had posted , she said it was a 17th birthday card to her niece who lives in @entity55			0
there is very little mail left that is so time sensitive that it must arrive overnight because email and other forms of electronic communication have usurped the need for speed , he said			1
mr @entity12 said : ‘ who cares if your letters comes one day later or two days later ? ‘ it really does not matter in virtually every case			2
’ he said the claim of ‘ the cheque is in the post ’ is ‘ long out of the window ’ , with most people simply transferring money online , rather than posting a cheque			0
many businesses do not bother with overnight postal deliveries either			0
the banking giant @entity79 , for example , uses a service which takes between three and five working days			0
asked yesterday on @entity83 ’s today programme if the universal service is on its way out , he said : ‘ most certainly ’			1
mr @entity12 said the idea of delivering letters to every single address in the country six times a week ‘ within five years ’ will be seen as absurd , although the universal service is heavily protected by law			1
he added : ‘ the big revolution is that letters as we know them are falling through the floor			0
’ in 2006 , @entity14 was handling around 80million letters and parcels every day , compared to just 58million a day today			2
at @entity14 ’s first annual general meeting yesterday [ thurs ] since its privatisation last october , one shareholder asked why it bothers with two different classes of stamps			2
@entity104 , the chairman , said : ‘ it gives our customers choice and i believe putting our customers first is the best way to run a business			0
’ a @entity14 spokesman added : ‘ @entity122 ’s most recent review of postal users ’ needs identified that one of the core user requirements is a range of services that enables customers to choose the most appropriate product or service for their needs			2
‘ customers have the right to choice , and the evidence shows they welcome this aspect of the universal service provided by @entity14			1
’ shareholders were also concerned the pay gap between postmen and directors , a continued pledge not to make political donations and wanted reassurance about its commitment to stamp collectors			0
of the army of around 500,000 shareholders in @entity14 , the company said 156 attended yesterday ’s @entity141 held at the vast @entity142 in @entity143			0
