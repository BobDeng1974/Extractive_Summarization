stock photo poking fun at fat people should be treated as seriously as racism and sexism , researchers have said			1

dr @entity16 , of @entity17 , spoke out after conducting two studies into the physical and psychological effects of fattism			2
her latest study , of more than 5,000 @entity24 adults found that those who were made to feel ashamed of their size suffered more symptoms of depression			1
they also had a lower quality of life than those who did n’t feel victimised			0
examples of fattism included being treated disrespectfully , including being the butt of jokes , receiving poorer services in shops , restaurants , hospitals and doctors ’ surgeries , being threatened and being assumed to be stupid			0
she previously showed shaming fat people into losing weight is counterproductive			2
far from shocking people into slimming , it actually leads to them piling on the pounds			0
it is thought fattism drives those who are already sensitive about their weight to comfort eat			0
fear of ridicule may also mean they avoid exercise			0
with two - thirds of @entity24 women overweight or obese , jibes , taunts and simple thoughtlessness could be having a huge effect on the nation ’s mental and psychological health			0
dr @entity7 , the lead author of both studies , said that people may believe that weight discrimination is socially acceptable because unlike ageism , sexism and racism , it is not covered by law			1
she said : ‘ in the @entity24 , the @entity75 2010 legally protects individuals from discrimination on the basis of age , sex , race , disability , religion or beliefs , sexual orientation , marital status , pregnancy , or gender reassignment ; making it clear that discriminatory behaviour of this nature is not to be accepted			0
‘ however , our results indicate that discriminatory experiences contribute to poorer psychological wellbeing in individuals with obesity , but there are currently no laws prohibiting weight discrimination			1

‘ weight bias has been documented not only among the general public but also among health professionals ; and many obese patients report being treated disrespectfully by doctors because of their weight			0
‘ everyone , including doctors , should stop blaming and shaming people for their weight , and offer support , and where appropriate , treatment			2
