@entity0 always hoped she 'd have a little girl to make her family complete - and her dream came true when her daughter @entity4 was born			1
but at the age of 10 , @entity4 started acting and dressing as a boy and by 16 , she revealed she was transgender and changed her name to @entity8			1
@entity0 , from @entity9 , accepted her son 's decision yet the pair were beset by bullying and abuse that led @entity8 , now 17 , to self harm and even attempt suicide			1
@entity4 ( left ) , @entity17 ( right ) felt different as a small child and began living as a boy from age 10 @entity8 and his supportive mother @entity0 appeared on @entity22 's @entity21 to talk about his journey @entity0 noticed her daughter was different at the age of six , when she became fascinated by her brother 's toys and games			1
she said : ' it started quite young , playing with boy 's toys and [ being ] interested in boys stuff			0
he used to copy his brother all the time , taking his stuff and following and copying everything he used to do			0
' as well as emulating his brother , as @entity4 , @entity8 also flew into uncontrollable rages			1
these fits became so bad and so frequent @entity0 even took him to the doctor to seek advice			2
' we thought it was adhd at first and he was tested and they could n't find anything			0
nothing at all was wrong			0
' @entity8 explains that he could n't put his finger on what he was feeling for years			2
he said : ' i knew when i was very young that something was n't right			0
i used to have these tantrums and be exploding all the time			0
both @entity8 and @entity0 received abuse over his decision to live as a man with his mother 's complete support ' i came out as bisexual at 12 but i was n't , i just thought i would be more accepted			1
' @entity0 decided to be entirely accepting of what her then daughter was telling her , but suspected there was something more underneath it			1
@entity8 is is using his experience to help others struggling with gender identity issues ' it was very important that i listened and understood what was making him unhappy			2
' i just went along with it			0
i wanted to see @entity8 happy instead of so stressed over his gender at the time			2
' i had an idea there was something more but i did n't want to question him too much			0
' i had a conversation with someone who was gay and they said not to push him , just to wait until @entity8 told me in his own time			1
' @entity0 's intuition turned out to be right and @entity8 eventually realised that he was not bisexual , but transgender			1
at the age of 16 , @entity8 came out to his mother as transgender and formally changed his name by deed poll			1
while @entity0 accepted @entity8 at every step of his journey , others were not so understanding and both @entity8 and @entity0 suffered at the hands of bullies			1
some people accused @entity0 of somehow encouraging @entity8 and the abuse became so bad at one point that he began self - harming and he even attempted suicide			1
but his transformation into a male body has , @entity8 says , helped him move on from these dark times and he now feels hopeful about his future			2
he said : ' i 'm actually progressing more because of the transitioning			0
it 's hurrying along so i 've got more hope in myself			0
' while the support he 's had from his mother and grandmother has been ' brilliant '			1
for her part , @entity0 says she does n't miss having a daughter			2
' i do n't miss it at all			0
he is still @entity8 and i am so so proud of him and the way that he has come out			2
@entity8 will begin taking hormones soon but will have to wait until he turns 18 before beginning his full physical transformation			0
he now is using his experience to help others struggling with gender identity issues through a transgender support group			0
