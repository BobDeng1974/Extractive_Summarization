@entity0 has launched an experimental spacecraft to fly around the moon and back to @entity3			1
the eight - day mission is seen as a test - run for the country 's first unmanned return trip to the lunar surface , which will take place in 2017			1
and if @entity0 successfully manages to bring samples back from the moon , they will be only the third nation to carry out such a mission after the @entity15 and @entity16			1
the spacecraft will fly around the moon on an eight - day mission			1
it is intended to be a precursor to a mission to the lunar surface in 2017 the spacecraft lifted off from the southwestern @entity21 satellite launch centre early this morning			1
it separated from its carrier rocket and entered @entity3 orbit shortly after , the @entity29 ( @entity30 ) reported , according to the official @entity33			0
' the first stage of the first return journey test in @entity0 's moon probe programme has been successful , ' @entity34 said after the launch , from the @entity21 space base in the southwestern province of @entity41			1
the module will be 257,000 miles ( 413,000 km ) from @entity3 at its furthest point on the eight - day mission			1
the official @entity33 news agency said it would re-enter the atmosphere at 11.2 kilometres per second ( 25,000 mph ) before slowing down - a process that generates extremely high temperatures - and it will land in northern @entity0 's @entity49 region			2
@entity0 's lunar exploration program , named @entity51 after a mythical goddess , has already launched a pair of orbiting lunar probes and last year landed a craft on the moon with a rover onboard			0
@entity0 has also hinted at a possible crewed mission to the moon at a future date if officials decide to combine the human spaceflight and lunar exploration programs			2
the module will be 257,000 miles ( 413,000 km ) from @entity3 at its furthest point on the eight - day mission			1
the official @entity33 news agency said it would re-enter the atmosphere at 11.2 kilometres per second ( 25,000 mph ) before slowing down - a process that generates extremely high temperatures - and it will land in northern @entity0 's @entity49 region			0
it will return to @entity3 using a @entity68 - designed method in which it will first bounce off @entity3 's atmosphere in order to slow it down to allow it to enter the atmosphere without burning up			0
@entity33 said the latest mission is to ' obtain experimental data and validate re-entry technologies such as guidance , navigation and control , heat shield and trajectory design ' for the future moonlander christened @entity51			0
it will return to @entity3 using a @entity68 - designed method in which it will first bounce off @entity3 's atmosphere in order to slow it down to allow it to enter the atmosphere without burning up			0
@entity0 's military - backed space program is a source of massive national pride , especially its series of successful manned missions that have placed up to three astronauts at a time in an experimental orbiting space station called @entity93 1			0
it sent its first astronaut into space in 2003 , becoming the third nation after @entity16 and the @entity15 to achieve manned space travel independently			2
@entity0 has powered ahead in a series of methodically timed steps , independent of the @entity15 programme , which is now in its sixth decade of putting people into space and has long - term plans to go to an asteroid and @entity105			2
alongside the manned program , @entity0 is developing the long march 5 heavy - lift rocket needed to launch a more permanent space station to be called @entity109			0
@entity0 's space programme has been picking up speed over the last decade			0
they have already sent a handful of astronauts into @entity3 orbit including @entity116 , left , @entity117 , right , and @entity118 pictured here in june 2012 on their way to the launch pad last year @entity0 successfully landed and operated a rover on the moon called @entity124 , shown			2
however , it ultimately succumbed to the bitterly cold lunar nights			0
@entity0 's next mission to the lunar surface in 2017 will lift return samples to @entity3			1

@entity0 sent a mission to the moon from the southwestern @entity21 satellite launch centre this morning
the spacecraft will fly around the moon on an eight - day mission
it is intended to be a precursor to a mission to the lunar surface in 2017
this will return samples back to @entity3 - only the third nation to do so after the @entity15 and @entity16
@entity0 also has plans to land people on the moon , possibly beyond 2020
