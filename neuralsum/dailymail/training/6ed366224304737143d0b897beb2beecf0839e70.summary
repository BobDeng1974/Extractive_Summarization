the 26 - year - old entrepreneur showed the social networking site a sneak preview of the new logo for her cooking business @entity12 , and one user pointed out @entity1 - who had styled the logo ' @entity16 ' - might need to rethink the grammar			0
this prompted @entity1 to ask whether or not the phrase needed an apostrophe - and if so , where - before deciding she did n't care as she preferred it without one			0
the debate began when @entity1 , left , tweeted a photograph of her new logo , right , for her company @entity28 's toolkit opinion on the micro-blogging website was divided , with some people feeling she needed to pay more attention to the rules of the @entity35 language in order to be correctly understood , others remarking that hers is a baking company , not an educational one , and that brands such as @entity40 get away with inaccurate logo phrasing			2
the discussion became fairly heated , with aghast users spluttering comments such as ' you ca n't change @entity35 grammar even if it does look better on logos ! ' and ' i always cringe at businesses with bad grammar '			0
@entity3 was divided over whether or not @entity1 should use the apostrophe in @entity28 's , while other users gave the @entity53 runner - up basic lessons in @entity35 grammar discussion then followed among users about whether she meant @entity28 's ( as in , the toolkit of one baker ) , or @entity28 ' ( meaning the toolkit of all bakers )			1
still others pointed out that her comment had been a very clever marketing ploy , prompting discussion of her business all over @entity3 and other media outlets			0
@entity1 narrowly missed out on the £ 250,000 business investment by @entity68 to dr @entity69 , who plans to use the money to open a plastic surgery chain			1
@entity1 wondered whether or not it would be terrible to stick with @entity28 , and users pointed out that it would make people ' cringe ' users pointed out that @entity28 's would be singular , @entity28 ' plural @entity1 , left , with @entity69 winner dr @entity69 , right , before the final of the 2013 series			1

@entity1 asked @entity3 if ( and where ) @entity28 's @entity12 needed an apostrophe
