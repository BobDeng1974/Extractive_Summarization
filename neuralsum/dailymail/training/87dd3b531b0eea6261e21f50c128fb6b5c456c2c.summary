@entity0 is the ultimate journeyman			1
the globetrotting goalkeeper played more than 400 games for 25 clubs across six continents , turned down @entity5 and signed for the @entity6			1
he also spent 101 days in a brutal jail after being wrongly charged with match - fixing and was declared dead three times while playing in the @entity10			1
but after declining the offer to sit behind @entity31 in the @entity5 pecking order , the youngster was grabbed by the wanderlust and left @entity34 to head to @entity35 in 1993			0
the next year the @entity36 came calling			0
but the seasoned pros at @entity39 's @entity38 were never going to go easy on the teutonic new boy			1
' two or three days after i arrived we went for a run in a park and suddenly someone gave some command , they grabbed me and got me undressed so i was completely naked in november in the freezing cold , ' he said			2
' they took all my clothes and my shoes and just left			0
i was lying in a ditch and was n't sure what to do , then i had to run for three miles back with nothing on in front of loads of ladies walking their dogs			0
it 's funny now but it was n't funny at the time , ' he told the @entity63			0
@entity0 failed to make the first team and moved to @entity65 a year later , where he once again did not make an appearance			1
@entity0 , who wrote a book called @entity68 , has enjoyed a remarkable career @entity0 poses with the @entity26 and @entity71 versions of his most entertaining tome it is his second stint on these shores for which he is best remembered			1
on @entity77 in 2003 ( while playing for his twelfth club , @entity76 ) @entity0 was accidentally struck in the chest by the knee of @entity81 striker @entity80			1
his lungs collapsed , and after performing mouth - to - mouth resuscitation , the club 's physio @entity83 declared @entity0 dead before managing to revive him			1
' it was n't like a kaleidoscope - there was no colour , it was all black and white			2
there were black and white diamonds and it was very quiet , ' said @entity0			1
' in the background there were figures but i could n't make out who they were			0
i did n't feel cold , i felt all warm			0
i felt i was floating and it was n't a scary feeling at all , ' he told @entity103			0
when he woke in hospital he complained of being substituted , and was back playing within a week			2
now 41 , @entity0 reflects upon another dark period in his life ; this time during his time in @entity108			1
1991 - 93 @entity109 1993 - 94 @entity110 1994 - 95 @entity38 1995 - 96 @entity65 1996 - 97 @entity111 ( loan ) 1997 @entity113 1997 @entity114 1998 @entity115 1998 - 99 sv @entity116 1999 - 2000 @entity117 2001 @entity118 2001 - 02 @entity76 ( loan ) 2001 - 02 @entity120 2002 @entity121 ( loan ) 2002 - 03 @entity76 2002 @entity118 2003 @entity123 ( loan ) 2003 @entity118 2004 @entity125 2004 - 06 @entity126 2006 - 07 @entity127 2007 @entity128 2007 @entity123 2007 @entity129 2008 @entity131 fc 2008 @entity132 2008 - 09 @entity133 2009 @entity134 2009 - 10 @entity135 one minute he was a television personality and an @entity138 model , the next he was sentenced to 101 days in jail after being found guilty of match - fixing			1
' in my case it was strange because i was actually accused of playing too well			2
two games we won and one game was a draw where i was man of the match			2
if a judge in court tells you you 've played better than you normally do it 's not really logical			0
' in the end i got out of it , the evidence was basically cleared as no money changed hands			0
' i came out of that after 101 days and became a better person			1
it was the toughest time in my life but also the time when i learnt the most , ' he explained to the @entity63			0
he told @entity103 : ' the prison had no bed , no toilet , no toilet paper , no toothbrush			2
i slept on the floor , ' he said			0
' people were on death row			0
' for breakfast , they do n't say good morning , they punch you in the face			0
i had to survive in that circus			0
if it was for 101 days , it felt like 25 years			1
' after becoming the only footballer to play professionally on all six continents , @entity0 finally brought the curtain down on his career in 2011			1
he wrote a book , @entity68 , which was longlisted for the @entity184 award , and continued in the game , scouting for @entity186 and commentated on the @entity187 for @entity26 television			1
and when he is n't doing that , he is consumed by his charity , @entity190			2
he hopes to take some of his footballing friends , including the likes of @entity193 , @entity194 , @entity195 , @entity196 and @entity197 to @entity20 to play a charity match to raise awareness of global warming			1
' i want to leave the scene as if nothing had ever happened			0
we will clear the airfield using the snowmobiles , use yellow tape for the lines and we will build the nets			0
within 10 minutes , the nets and lines are gone and nothing will be left			0
' we will have scientists advising us and if they say we can play elsewhere , fair enough but at the moment , the airfield is the most convenient , ' he explained to @entity103			2
and rather like his playing career , you get the impression that @entity0 is already planning his next move .			1
