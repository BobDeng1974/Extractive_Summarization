@entity0 yesterday continued to insist he had heard nothing to suggest @entity2 had been involved in any offending while a @entity4 mp			1
the peer , who led the @entity7 between 1976 and 1988 , admitted he had been informed in 1979 that @entity2 had been investigated by police for child abuse when he was a @entity10 councillor			1
however , he maintained that ‘ no complaint or even rumour ’ reached his office that @entity2 had been accused of paedophile activities during the 1970s when he was @entity2 mp for @entity13 and @entity0 was his @entity15 colleague			1
speaking at length for the first time about claims he ignored rumours about the 28 - stone monster , @entity0 said he was happy to be interviewed as part of any police probe into whether there was a cover - up of @entity2 ’s crimes			1
he recommended @entity2 be given a knighthood in 1988 – despite claims that senior figures in both the political and security establishment knew of allegations against him			0
last night @entity42 , the @entity10 mp whose book revealed the full extent of @entity2 ’s abuse , accused @entity0 of being disingenuous			1
from the mail : april 12 yesterday 's mail ‘ is he really telling the public that no one ever mentioned these allegations to him ? ’ he asked			0
‘ we are talking about what was an exceptionally small political party			0
‘ it seems incredible that @entity55 had n’t heard of any of these allegations after 1979			0
’ on thursday , @entity58 leader @entity57 urged police to investigate whether there had been an establishment cover - up of @entity2 ’s activities			1
he died in 2010 without facing justice			0
in a statement yesterday to the @entity65 , @entity0 said he would co-operate with any police inquiry			0
‘ i agree that there should be a fresh inquiry and am happy to be interviewed , having known nothing beyond the 1979 published report of police investigations when @entity2 was a @entity10 councillor in the @entity72 , ’ he said			2
@entity4 mp @entity2 , pictured in his robes as vice chancellor of @entity75 , died in 2010 without facing justice for his abuse ‘ no complaint , nor even rumour , of his alleged misbehaviour as an mp ever reached us , and indeed stories only came to light after his death			1
’ mr @entity42 said he was disappointed that @entity0 seemed to be highlighting @entity2 ’s earlier @entity10 links : ‘ most members of the public , and certainly me , do not care which party @entity2 belonged to			1
‘ this is a case of a senior politician using his power to abuse boys , and @entity55 should be thinking more about the victims and less about party politics			1
‘ @entity0 is being disingenuous – muddying the waters rather than clearing them			2
he now needs to come clean to the public on when he challenged @entity2 , what he said to him and what @entity2 said back			0
‘ we know for a fact that @entity4 mps , @entity4 parliamentary candidates and @entity4 councillors throughout the decades knew about these allegations			2
’ claims about @entity2 ’s paedophilia were printed in the may 1979 issue of the tiny @entity106 , and the report was brought to the attention of @entity0			2
his spokesman responded at the time : ‘ it ’s not a very friendly gesture , publishing that			0
all he seems to have done is spanked a few bare bottoms ’			0
but it has been claimed that the @entity4 leadership was so worried the allegations would gain wider circulation that they called in @entity121 ’s hugely influential legal fixer , lord @entity122 , to hush them up			0
@entity123 said his barrister father @entity124 , who was then representing former @entity4 leader @entity125 as he prepared to stand trial for conspiracy to murder , feared that reports of @entity2 ’s abuse in national newspapers could have seriously damaged his defence			2
he added : ‘ my understanding both from the time and afterwards was that @entity122 may well have been involved			0
it appears that he did a very good job of stopping the story from being repeated			0
’ despite overwhelming evidence that rumours of @entity2 ’s appalling behaviour were widely known at @entity15 , @entity0 maintains he knew – or heard – nothing save for the allegations in 1979 that the mp had abused young boys			1
as @entity10 mp @entity42 ’s explosive book revealed in the @entity147 last week , @entity2 ’s serial sexual abuse of vulnerable youngsters was repeatedly covered up by the @entity148			1
and in the years following the original allegations , printed in the @entity106 and repeated in the satirical magazine @entity151 , @entity2 ’s sordid activities continued			2
despite overwhelming evidence rumours of @entity2 ¿ s behaviour were widely known at @entity15 , @entity0 maintains he knew - or heard - nothing save for the allegations in 1979 that the mp had abused young boys was @entity0 , who nominated the predatory paedophile for a knighthood in 1988 , totally ignorant of rumours of the mp ’s depraved conduct ? here the @entity147 details the incidents he claims he knew nothing about :			1

@entity0 says ' no complaint or rumour ' reached his office that @entity2 had been accused of paedophile activities during the 1970s
but admitted he was informed in 1979 that @entity2 was being investigated
@entity42 mp today accused lord steal of being disingenuous
in the 1980s @entity2 ’s car was *pulled* over on the *motorway* near @entity174 and *traffic* officers discovered child porn in the boot . local police wanted to press charges but a phone call was made from @entity181 and the mp was released without charge .
one young @entity4 activist was sexually assaulted in @entity2 ’s office in the @entity186 in the 1980s as other mps , including @entity10 leader @entity188 , *walked* by .
@entity2 ’s alleged abuse of boys was publicly *raised* during the 1987 general **election** by his @entity10 *opponent* @entity193 . ‘ everyone in @entity13 heard rumours about him , and i believed they should be *properly* investigated , ’ he said . ‘ perhaps it was dirty politics on my behalf , but @entity2 was a dirty politician , so i *decided* to do it . ’
a former campaigner for the @entity204 , then in an *alliance* with the @entity4 , said senior party officials *panicked* during the 1983 **election** through fear that @entity2 would be exposed as a child abuser . @entity209 , an @entity204 activist in @entity210 , said : ‘ there was a kind of an alert , an alarm that one of the other parties had got hold of the fact that @entity2 had *interfered* with boys yet again . ’
@entity2 was a *visitor* to the *notorious* @entity221 in south - west @entity181 , now the focus of a @entity224 investigation into an alleged *vip* paedophile ring in the 1980s .
