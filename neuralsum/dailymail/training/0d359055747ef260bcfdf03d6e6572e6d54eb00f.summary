it 's the dead of night on a chilly october evening			0
you drive down a deserted street in @entity3 , @entity4 — the isolation of it all sending shivers up your spine			1
then you see him : a white mask , unruly bright - red hair , eyes like black pools of death staring coldly at you			1
his yellow jumpsuit shines with light from the only lamp nearby , the multicolored balloons he holds floating lazily above his creepy face			2
the murderous clown looks at you , swinging back and forth on his mechanic toy unicorn , a frightening smile frozen on his pale face			2
such has been the scene in this small town between @entity27 and @entity28 , where since october 1 local residents have reported sightings of evil clowns roaming creepily down their streets			1
creepy clowns such as this one have been popping up around @entity3 , @entity4 what would you do if you were walking down the street and ran into one of these creepy masked men ? some residents in @entity3 follow social media to know when the next clown appearance will be so they can find these masked weirdos props and costumes change routinely , leading some to believe there is a menacing gang of bandits dressing up like the clowns from everyone 's nightmares			1
