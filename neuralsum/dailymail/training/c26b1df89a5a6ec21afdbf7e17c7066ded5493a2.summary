this is the moment a member of a patriot militia guarding the streets of @entity4 was stripped of his rifle by police - even though residents want him there			1
the man from the @entity10 was told to hand over the weapon and threatened with arrest as police in the @entity15 city issued an order for them to stand down			1
senior officers claim that that are acting illegally but the @entity10 are ignoring the order			1
they are challenging it in the @entity15 courts because they say it is a breach of their constitutional rights - and that @entity4 needs the extra help			2
the @entity10 were thrust into the spotlight when photos of them standing guard on top of buildings in @entity4 to stop them being burned during the recent unrest were published in the national media			1
each man is carrying an @entity57 assault rifle as well as handguns deterrent : the @entity10 say their presence kept looters and rioters away from other buildings			1
the man on the right is carrying a model 1911 semi-automatic .45 pistol ' cocked and locked ' - with the hammer back but the safety catch on			0
argument : @entity70 and @entity10 disagree on whether the militia can patrol in @entity4			1
the disagreement is going to court they are a pro-constitution group of former and serving soldiers , fireman and cops with a reported membership of 35,000 , all of whom are volunteers			0
they have been courted by the @entity82 , count @entity83 among their admirers and are deeply suspicious of the government			2
one of the pledges in their manifesto reads : ' we will not obey orders to disarm the @entity92 people			2
' the dramatic incident was captured last weekend on top of a building the @entity10 vowed to protect , they say after seeking permission of all the business owners			2
@entity99 , a defense contractor and head of the @entity102 branch of the organisation , told @entity104 : ' they told us to get down off the roof and told us to show them our ids			2
' i told them no , you do n't have probable cause			2
they told us we were violating a city ordinance and we said we were not			0
then a two - hour argument began			1
' helping : @entity99 of the @entity10 with a business owner in @entity4 , @entity15			1
he told @entity104 the group was going to court to show that they were not violating a city ordinance presence : mr @entity99 said that after his men , who include @entity123 soldiers , handed down their rifles they were checked by the officers who had to give them back when they realized the guns were in order and properly licensed			1
mr @entity99 said : ' in the end they let us stay on the roof			0
' it was harassment , plain and simple			0
they do n't like us because we 're a pain in the ass , but the people in @entity4 want us here			1
' we are here to help people that the government left hanging ... these people pay their taxes and they deserve the same level of protection as the governor and his wealthy supporters			1
' the @entity10 were founded in 2008 by @entity147 , a @entity148 - educated lawyer and former aide to @entity150 senator @entity150			2
among their members they count @entity152 , who believe that president @entity154 was not born in @entity92 and is not entitled to be president			0
the decision to clear officer @entity157 ( right ) over the killing of @entity159 ( left ) was followed by rioting in @entity4 flames : one of the more than a dozen buildings set on fire in the violent protests inflamatory : the riots came after the decision to clear officer @entity157			1
it was greeted by @entity159 's stepfather shouting ' let 's burn this b * * * * down ' to an angry mob			0
he has since apologised a lengthy article in @entity174 described the @entity10 as a disparate group who are united against the over policing of the @entity92 people			1
according to their manifesto , they believe : ' we will not obey orders to conduct warrant-less searches of the @entity92 people ... we will not obey orders to impose martial law or a ' state of emergency ' on the state			0
' mr @entity99 said that in his eyes , he was just a ' private citizen helping out a neighbor '			0
he said : ' when i assembled my team here the @entity189 told me that i did not have a dog in this fight and you need to pull your guys out			0
' they said you need to rely on the professionals , the police			0
' i replied that i respect your opinion but you are wrong and that i do have a dog in this fight			0
i was born and raised here so go f * * * yourself			0
' in a 2008 article for @entity207 magazine that has been posted on the @entity10 ' blog , mr @entity147 articulated the fears of the group in detail			2
he described the nightmare scenario if @entity213 , who he called the ' dominatrix in chief ' , got elected instead of president @entity154 , a scenario that could come true come 2016			0
he wrote : ' imagine that @entity217 is sworn in as president in 2009			0
' after a conveniently timed ' domestic terrorism ' incident ( just a coincidence , of course ) or yet another @entity223 induced mass shooting , she promptly crams a @entity225 mandated , @entity227 style , total ban on the private possession of firearms through a compliant , @entity218 controlled @entity232			0
preparation : police put on their gas masks after chasing off looters from a business in @entity4			1
aftermath : the @entity239 was called in in force the night after the riots to restore order and guard key businesses ' dressed in her favorite chairman @entity246 signature pantsuit , @entity217 signs the ban into law with the obligatory choir of sell - out police chiefs as backdrop ( just like the good ol days when @entity253 used the oval office )			1
' @entity227 does not have such a ban on all firearms , but forbids the private ownership of handguns and automatic weapons , as well as other categories of firearms , and licenses all gun owners			0
the dispute over the @entity10 patrolling @entity4 is over whether or not they need a licence to act as security guards			1
@entity102 police say that they do but the @entity10 say they do n't because they are volunteers .			2

@entity269 militia called @entity10 guarded streets and businesses in @entity4 in wake of riots which tore through town
