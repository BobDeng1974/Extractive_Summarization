the district will look into this situation to determine if additional staff training is needed to prepare for future situations			0
' @entity9 says whether the school is meant to keep kids in the classroom or not she 'd like an official apology			2
@entity11 is set up in such a way that students need to go outside the building in order to go to the bathroom , hence why the send - grader was forced to stay inside during lock - down ' i contacted the school			1
not even an apology , ' @entity9 said			0
@entity9 told reporters that her daughter is traumatized after the incident and fears for her child 's mental health should other students continue to make fun of her			1

a lock - down situation can last a few minutes or several hours , depending on the situation			2
when a lock - down is instituted , it is normal for teachers and staff to be unaware of how long the school or building will remain in lock - down status			2

' since the bathroom was outside of the building , the school saw exiting the classroom as a safety issue .			0
