@entity1 captain @entity0 and @entity2 frustrated @entity4 's push for victory on day five of the third test in @entity7 on tuesday , but the draw was enough for the hosts to complete an emphatic 2 - 0 series win with a game in hand			1
with @entity4 needing seven wickets from the final session at the @entity17 , their bowlers could only manage three as @entity0 and @entity2 survived a nervous final hour to push @entity1 to safety			1
@entity4 have added left - arm spinner @entity19 to their squad for the fourth test			1
@entity22 ( centre ) celebrates taking the wicket of in - form @entity1 batsman @entity25 ( right ) @entity1 's @entity26 arches his back to evade a bouncer from @entity4 fast bowler @entity29 @entity26 ( left ) battled for 48 from 117 balls in the second innings while @entity25 ( right ) scored 54 to go with his outstanding first innings knock of 169 after withstanding an onslaught from the @entity35 quicks @entity26 was out pulling to @entity36 ( right ) @entity1 were 174 for six when @entity4 captain @entity37 conceded the draw with four overs remaining , with @entity0 unbeaten on 24 and @entity2 on eight			1
the tourists were 210 short of their victory target			0
@entity4 declared on 318 - 9 at lunch , setting @entity1 384 to win in 70 overs			1
for a time after lunch , that appeared more than adequate for the hosts , whose pacemen scythed through @entity1 's top order with three wickets in the first nine overs of their innings			2
opening batsman @entity53 was out lbw for a duck off @entity22 in the second over and @entity56 , surprisingly sent in at number three , was caught in the next over for one by @entity58 who bolted back from the slips when the nervous debutant sent a top edge high from a poor pull shot			0
@entity37 dives spectacularly to the right to save a certain boundary after an edge from @entity67 @entity4 's newly appointed captain @entity37 called the match a draw with four overs remaining opener @entity72 was dismissed lbw for 11 , somewhat harshly by umpire @entity73 , off the bowling of @entity36 before @entity25 and @entity26 steadied to take the tourists to 104 - 3 at tea , 280 runs short of their victory target			1
@entity22 removed @entity1 's tenacious @entity25 for 54 on the first ball after tea to open the door , but a stubborn @entity26 and @entity67 dug in for a valuable hour before @entity29 struck with 19 overs remaining to break the partnership			2
he rattled @entity67 with a ball that struck him clean on the grill of his helmet , then bowled him two balls later with a slower delivery that jagged back viciously off the seam to have him out for 21			0
@entity22 appeals as he claims the lbw wicket of @entity53 , the first @entity1 batsman to fall on day five @entity29 ( left ) celebrates taking the wicket of @entity56 , surprisingly sent in at number three @entity72 trudges off after being harshly adjudged lbw off the bowling of @entity36 for 11 @entity1 fans show their support despite the chance of their team winning being a long shot perhaps unnerved by the loss of @entity1 's last specialist batsman , @entity26 became jumpy , and nearly played on to his stumps off @entity58 the next ball			2
he was out a few overs later , throwing away his wicket for 48 with a horrible pull off @entity36 that floated straight to @entity103 at midwicket			0
joining @entity0 at the wicket , number eight batsman @entity2 was nearly caught behind on one by @entity58 who dived across from first slip but put down a sharp one - handed chance			0
both batsmen survived a number of false shots but showed grit to play out the remaining overs			0
@entity4 may ponder the wisdom of their relatively late declaration , having already constructed a lead of 326 runs by stumps on day four , but were in no mood to hurry proceedings with only a draw needed to make the @entity123 test starting on jan. 6 a dead rubber .			0

@entity4 *5*30** and 318 for 9 draw with @entity1 *465* and 174 for 6 at the @entity17
