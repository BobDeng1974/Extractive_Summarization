by @entity0 published : 22:00 est , 24 february 2014 @entity2 : 14:59 est , 27 february 2014 so - called @entity5 ' evil genius ' @entity3 used his controversial gamesmanship monday to claim yet another victory on the quiz show			1
the 30 - year - old @entity10 insurance professional took home $ 20,800 that he 'll add to the $ 102,800 he 's already won since he first began his winning streak january 28			1
despite the criticism being near constant since his winning began , it does n't look like @entity3 will start conforming to more accepted tactics any time soon			1
' he could easily reel off five wins this week , or get tripped up by a tricky @entity28 or @entity5 ! clue , ' @entity23 told @entity30			1
' that 's the beauty of @entity5 ! -- it 's so unpredictable			2
' but @entity23 admits that @entity3 's risk averse style eliminates as much of the luck factor as possible			1
in monday 's game , @entity3 's hardest - questions - first strategy left him with more than four times the winnings of the second place opponent by the game 's final question			1
@entity3 lost $ 10,000 when he incorrectly answered a question about a famous abolitionist of the 19th century admired by @entity45			2
however , after both his opponents also failed to correctly answer @entity46 , @entity3 and his tactics won the day			1
he 'll be back on tuesday 's pre-taped episode to battle to maintain his status as the game 's most loathed returning champion			1
@entity3 calls the strategy , which aims to disarm his opponents , @entity56 , after successful 1980s player @entity56 who also ' bounced ' around the board			0
the strategy sparked outrage across social media last week as viewers accused @entity3 of ' unsportsmanship '			0
no sweat : @entity3 missed the question about abolitionist @entity46 but he 'd already entered the final round with four times the winning of his nearest opponent and easily won the day a little bit different : @entity3 , 30 , ( right ) @entity5 's latest and greatest star , has used @entity5 game theory to become nightly must - see tv			1
but his unorthodox methods have made him a polarizing figure but @entity3 has consistently dismissed the furor , telling @entity72 : ' like any game , strategy plays a big role			2
' he added : ' i ca n't change your impression of me but , again , we 're playing for money			0
between $ 10,000 and getting haters on @entity82 , $ 10,000 is more important to me			0
' the so - called ' evil genius ' , as dubbed by angry @entity82 users , has also received support from the show 's host @entity88 , who said @entity3 ' seems to get ' the concept of winning			2
@entity3 is quick and confident with his answers , darting from a $ 1,000 question to $ 200 for seemingly no reason			2
but he has received a mixed reception from viewers with some sites such as @entity97 are calling him a ' hero ' , whilst others blogs like @entity100 describe him as a ' mad genius '			0
@entity102 : @entity3 's game - play tactics appear to delight and frustrate viewers in equal measure before appearing on the show , @entity3 claims he studied the mechanics of the gameshow that has been running for 30 years			1
' i decided pretty early on , you know , i 'm not going to be able to learn all the things i do n't know in terms of actual knowledge , ' he says			0
' you only get a month between when they call you and when you have to go out for the show			0
so i said , ' what 's the strategy that 'll serve me best on the show ? ' it seems that people do n't actually think about the strategy of the game itself as much as they do about the knowledge			0
' typically , contestants choose a single category and progressively move from the lowest amount up to the highest , giving viewers an easy - to - understand escalation of difficulty			0
however , because @entity3 is finding the hidden @entity28 , which are normally located within the three highest - paying rungs in the categories , it means rather than building up in difficulty , he ends up starting with the most difficult questions			1
after a couple of the most difficult high - stakes questions have been answered , he moves over to another category			1
it can be a frustrating watch because it does n't allow the viewer to get into each subject matter and viewers are n't given enough to time to get in a rhythm or fully comprehend the new subject area but @entity3 defends accusations that he is being ' unsportmanlike			0
' contestants often avoid topics they unsure on , @entity3 was playing tactically : if he lost , the most it would cost him was $ 5 , and either way , it would take the @entity28 out of play for everyone else in the game			1
host @entity153 and the audience giggled when the question came , @entity3 immediately blurted out ' i do n't know			2
' it was n't a waste of a @entity28 , as he kept that question out of the hands of the other contestants			2
winning in @entity5 just means beating the other two , and his strategy made that possible			0
other haters online dislike @entity3 for his incessant buzzer - clicking but @entity3 defends his gameplay			2
' there 's no logical reason for most people to play the game the way they do it - start at the top of one category and then go all the way down until you finish it , ' @entity3 says			1
' the only control you have in the game is the ability to pick where the next question is gon na be			0
if you have that advantage and you jump around the board , you can put the other players off their game			0
that 's your advantage , and you do n't just want to give that up for nothing			0
' playing to win : @entity3 went out of his way and jumped around the board to find as many @entity0 doubles as possible			0

@entity3 's methods have won him criticism from many jeopardy fans who say watching him play is no fun
he opts to choose the high - stakes questions first instead of starting with easier ones and searches for *coveted* @entity28 questions
though unpopular , his tactics again won him the game on monday despite getting the @entity5 question wrong
on one *occasion* he forced a *tiebreak* , generously allowing his fellow contestant to go home with a huge payday
he returns tuesday to battle to retain his status as the game 's most loathed returning champion
