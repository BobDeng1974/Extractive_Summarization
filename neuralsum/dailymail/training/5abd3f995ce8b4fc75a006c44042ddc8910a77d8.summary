sir @entity0 said ' no one should weep ' for @entity1 if the party loses 40 mps in the next election former prime minister @entity0 today blamed @entity1 for the growing threat of @entity7 independence – claiming the party had spent years attacking the conservatives and @entity10			1
sir @entity0 said @entity1 and the @entity17 ‘ have fed a divisive narrative that has bitten deep , ignoring the revolution in @entity7 living standards brought about , in large part , by conservative policies ’			1
he added : ‘ it would be ironic indeed if @entity7 voted for separation , and @entity1 lost all its significant representation in the @entity21			1
if this comes to pass , no one should weep for them			2
’ sir @entity0 's remarks , in an article in the @entity27 newspaper today , come amid growing panic among senior @entity1 figures over the prospect of independence			1
the party would lose more than 40 mps , potentially depriving it of the chance of a @entity35 majority after the next election			1
but a vote for @entity7 independence would be ‘ disastrous ’ for the whole of the @entity38 and not just @entity1 , sir @entity0 said			1
in a second impassioned plea to @entity7 , in an interview on the @entity41 this morning , he said @entity38 would be ' diminished ' on the world stage			2
he told @entity44 's today programme that the @entity38 was ‘ the most successful union ’ in history but would be badly damaged without @entity7			2
he said : ‘ i am desperately concerned at what is happening			2
we would be immensely weaker as a nation in every respect - morally , politically , in every material aspect - if @entity7 and the rest of the @entity38 were to part company			2
‘ this year is the 100th anniversary of the @entity55			0
as we honour the people who fought together then , would it not be extraordinary if the @entity17 broke up the most successful union and partnership in all history in any part of the world ? ’ sir @entity0 said that young @entity7 considering casting a vote for independence in next week 's referendum would find themselves living in ‘ a very different country ’ over the coming decades if there was a @entity69 vote			1
‘ there is easy assumption that @entity7 will be waved into the @entity72			0
well , maybe after a period of years that 's possible but it 's not certain			0
@entity75 for example would n't welcome a separatist nation , ’ he said			0
‘ there is the belief they are going to be able to get into @entity80			0
why would @entity80 let them in when the @entity17 propose to wreck the @entity83 independent nuclear weapon ? ‘ if @entity38 lost @entity83 it would have lost what has shielded it and protected it for a long time - including @entity7			1
' for that to be done by the enemy would be a disaster , to have it done by friends is almost unbelievable			0
’ former prime minister @entity91 has become the de-facto leader of the @entity93 campaign amid a surge in support for independence sir @entity0 said that the lose of the @entity83 nuclear deterrent - which is currently based in @entity7 - would have consequences for the whole of the @entity38			1
‘ our role in @entity80 would be reduced , our relations consequently with the @entity103 would be damaged , ’ he said ‘ the @entity38 would be weaker in every international body it attends			0
we would lose our seat at the top table in the @entity107			0
’ the former premier - who warned 20 years ago that @entity7 devolution would be ‘ the high road to separation ’ - was scathing about the @entity17 's inability to say what currency they would use if they did achieve independence			1
‘ it is one week away from the vote and people of @entity7 do not know what currency they will have - i 've never known such incompetence , ’ he said			0
