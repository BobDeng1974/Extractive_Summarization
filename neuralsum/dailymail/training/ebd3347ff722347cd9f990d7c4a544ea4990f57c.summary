by @entity0 the two countries were once at loggerheads over the use of nuclear warheads , but now the @entity5 and @entity6 have joined forces to develop the technology together - and the partnership could one day lead to weapons being used to destroy asteroids hurtling towards earth			1
last month an agreement between the two countries was signed outlining the use of technology to create ' international safeguards ' and offer ' defense from asteroids			1
' the move signals a step closer towards the technology being used for such projects and builds on the work of various leading nuclear experts who have been actively developing the idea in recent years			1
it was signed by the @entity5 secretary of energy @entity48 and director general of the @entity6 state corporation @entity51 , on 16 september			1
it is hoped the new agreement will complement provisions of the @entity5 - @entity56 in the @entity57 , that came into force in january 2011			1
' this agreement supports president @entity61 ’s non-proliferation and climate priorities by providing a venue for scientific collaboration and relationship - building between the @entity5 and @entity6 research and technical communities , ' said @entity68 at the time			1
@entity69 claims astronomers have detected more than 10,000 asteroids with orbits that could potentially bring them closer , or in contact , with earth since 1995			1
around 9 per cent of these are believed to be around 3,000 feet long , according to reports in the @entity77			2
the most threatening of these , predicted to strike only once every 700,000 to 100 million years , could desolate the planet			2
this impact would be similar to that caused by the asteroid thought to have killed off the dinosaurs 65 million years ago			0
a 60 - foot asteroid damaged around 4,000 buildings in @entity6 when it exploded over the town of @entity37 earlier this year			0
yet , objects this large are said to only plummet to earth once every 100 years or so			0
rocks around 460ft long , that would have 300 megatons of force , hit every 30,000 years			0
' jointly , these communities will work to further develop advanced technologies that can address some of our most pressing nuclear energy and nuclear security challenges			2
' the original plans to join forces date back to 1995 when nuclear weapons designers from the @entity98 and the @entity5 met to discuss the imminent threat of asteroids and how technology could prevent it			1
since that time @entity69 claims astronomers have detected more than 10,000 asteroids with orbits that could potentially bring them closer , or in contact , with earth			1
around nine per cent of these are believed to be around 3,000 feet long , according to reports in the @entity77			0
the most threatening of these , predicted to strike only once every 700,000 to 100 million years , could desolate the planet - similar to the asteroid believed to have killed off the dinosaurs 65 million years ago			0
however , as @entity114 from the @entity115 , explains : ' even smaller rocks between 460 and 3,170 feet wide can flatten cities or wreak havoc			0
' the theory has also been used in science fiction films , for example , in the 1998 blockbuster film @entity123 , an asteroid the size of @entity125 threatens earth and a team of astronauts , led by @entity129 , fly towards it and blow it up			0
two years ago , research physicist and nuclear weapons designer @entity132 , from @entity134 in @entity135 received a discretionary grant for his work into solving how the weapons could be used			1
his work runs parallel to that of the @entity140 , where @entity5 nuclear weapons are designed			2
research scientist @entity143 , from the laboratory , has been studying the effects of detonations on asteroids since 2012 and has simulated explosions using the @entity150 ’s @entity149 supercomputer			1
in the 1998 blockbuster film @entity123 , an asteroid the size of @entity125 threatens earth and a team of astronauts , led by @entity129 , pictured , fly towards it and blow it up elsewhere , @entity154 , from @entity155 recently received a million - dollar research grant from @entity69 to discover if an ' impact device or nuclear explosion could deflect an asteroid from its path			1
' @entity154 told @entity114 from - who has conducted a series of interviews with these leading experts - he is using a device called a ' gas gun ' set up at @entity69 ’s @entity167 to study the impacter			0
he explained that a complete nuclear deflection could work if researchers knew about the imminent danger around a decade in advance			2
if the time to impact was closer than that , @entity175 added ' it would be too late for deflection but a carefully executed nuke strike would prevent most damage			2
' a 60 - foot asteroid damaged around 4,000 buildings when it exploded over @entity6 earlier this year			0
the city of @entity37 , pictured , 900 miles east of @entity183 and close to the @entity185 border , took the brunt of the impact			0
objects this large are said to only plummet to earth once every 100 years or so a 60 - foot asteroid damaged around 4,000 buildings in @entity6 when it exploded over the town of @entity37 earlier this year - although objects this large are said to only plummet to earth once every 100 years or so			0
while rocks around 460ft long , that would have 300 megatons of force , hit every 30,000 years			0
the likelihood of the plans being put into action , however , could be limited after president @entity61 announced in 2009 he is committed ' to seeking a world without nuclear weapons ' , and the plans could potentially go against the 1967 @entity203 signed by 129 countries , that prevents using nuclear weapons in space			1
concerns have been raised about radioactive debris falling to earth .			0

the two countries signed an agreement to research nuclear technology
it claims the technology could one day be used as ' defense from asteroids '
plans build on existing research and computer simulations in @entity135
however , international treaties could prevent the plans becoming reality
