@entity0 left wheelchair - bound by multiple sclerosis can walk , run and even dance again after being given a pioneering stem cell treatment			1
doctors have described the recoveries as ‘ miraculous ’ , while patients say they have been given their lives back			2
the treatment uses a patient ’s own stem cells – the body ’s master cells – to fight the disease			1
recovery : @entity16 sufferer @entity14 became wheelchair - bound after the birth of daughter @entity18 , but thanks to the stem cell transplant she can dance , run and chase after @entity18 in the park if it fulfils its early promise , it could be the first therapy that does not just slow the damage done by the condition , but reverses it			1
professor @entity27 , of the @entity28 in @entity29 , said : ‘ since we started treating patients some three years ago some of the results have been miraculous			0
today , @entity14 can run after her daughter @entity18			0
two years ago she could take her for a walk only if someone pushed her wheelchair while she held on to @entity18 ’s pushchair			0
miss @entity14 , 25 , of @entity29 , pictured with @entity18 , was diagnosed with @entity16 after suffering numbness and blurred vision			2
she became wheelchair - bound after her health worsened on @entity18 ’s birth			1
she needed help with basic tasks and could n’t even wiggle her toes			0
three weeks after the stem cell transplant she was able to walk out of hospital			0
now , more than 18 months on , she is almost back to normal			0
she has a part - time office job and , although she still gets tired , can dance , run and chase after @entity18 , two , in the park			2
she said : ‘ all i wanted to be able to do is take @entity18 out			0
i am more or less back to normal			0
’ @entity51 collapsed when out celebrating her 22nd birthday and six weeks later was paralysed from the neck down by @entity16 other treatments failed but now , after the stem cell treatment , miss @entity55 , 25 , of @entity56 in @entity57 , can walk on crutches , has passed her driving test and ordered a car			1
she told the @entity61 : ‘ this treatment has given me my life back			0
’ ' this is not a word i would use lightly but we have seen profound neurological improvements			0
’ however , more research is needed to prove the patients are not just experiencing a temporary remission , which does happen in @entity16 the neurological condition , which is more common in women than men , usually strikes those in their 20s and 30s and affects 2.5million people worldwide , including 100,000 @entity0			2
it can cause blindness and paralysis , but current drugs are not suitable for all and there is no cure			0
the disease occurs when ‘ friendly fire ’ from the body ’s immune system destroys myelin , the fatty protective sheath around nerve fibres in the brain and spinal cord , disrupting the transmission of vital signals			1
the @entity29 treatment uses the stem cells to ‘ reboot ’ the immune system so that it stops attacking the body and brain			1
first , a sample of the patient ’s blood is taken and stem cells are removed from it and stored			1
the patient is then given a high dose of chemotherapy to wipe out their faulty immune system			1
finally , they are given their stem cells back			1
as master cells , they are able to form a new , healthy immune system			1
the transplant has a one - off cost of around £ 30,000 , similar to the amount spent on some patients ’ drugs each year			2
as well as stopping the disease in its tracks the treatment , known as autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation , seems to heal damage that has already been done			2
@entity51 , 25 , of @entity56 , pictured with her mother @entity127 , was paralysed as result of her ms , but now , after treatment , she can walk on crutches and has passed her driving test a number of @entity16 sufferers were given pioneering therapy at the @entity28 in @entity29 multiple sclerosis ( @entity16 ) is a chronic disease that attacks the central nervous system ( the brain , spinal cord and optic nerves )			1
the progress , severity and specific symptoms of @entity16 can not be predicted			2
@entity16 is a lifelong disease for which a cause and cure are yet to be found ; however , doctors and scientists are making discoveries about the treatment and management of @entity16 every day			1
the visible and hidden symptoms of @entity16 are unpredictable and vary from person to person and from time to time in the same person			1
however , symptoms can include difficulties walking , pain , dizziness , slurred speech , emotional and mood changes , memory problems and extreme tiredness			0
a man who was blind in one eye has almost normal vision again			0
a woman in @entity168 who needed 24 - hour care appears free of @entity16 more than a decade after being given a transplant of her own stem cells			1
despite these dramatic improvements , the treatment is not suitable for all patients			2
a @entity176 trial on almost 150 , reported last month in the @entity177 , showed it to help roughly half the time			0
there are also concerns about complications including potentially lethal infections			0
professor @entity27 and colleagues are seeking patients with relapsing - remitting @entity16 , the most common form , for an @entity189 - funded trial			1
the @entity190 described the @entity29 work as ‘ very encouraging ’ and said it is eagerly awaiting the results of larger trials .			0

pioneering treatment has allowed wheelchair - bound patients to run again
patient given high dose of chemotherapy to wipe out faulty immune system
therapy then uses person *'s* own stem cells to fight the *devastating* disease
it may be the first ever treatment to *successfully* reverse symptoms of @entity16
