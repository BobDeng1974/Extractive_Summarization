it was the most shameful hour in the history of @entity3 football			0
ten minutes into their final group game of the 1982 @entity6 in @entity7 , @entity8 put @entity9 1 - 0 up against neighbours @entity11			1
it was a scoreline that would send both teams through to the following round			0
from that moment on , the two sides honoured an implicit non-aggression pact			0
neither side made any significant attempt to score			0
disgrace : @entity9 's ( centre ) victory against @entity11 in the 1982 @entity6 has forever been tarnished bad pact : the 1 - 0 win ensured both sides qualified for the next round , whilst @entity25 were knocked out @entity26 : @entity8 ( left ) scored @entity9 's goal in their 1 - 0 win against @entity11 in the 1982 @entity6 for over an hour , the whole stadium in @entity30 provided a soundtrack of whistles and boos			1
both @entity3 and @entity35 television commentators apologised to viewers on behalf of their teams			0
but it did n’t help			0
the game finished 1 - 0			1
@entity25 , the unfortunate victims of the disgrace , were knocked out , left only to fume at the terrible injustice			1
thirty two years on , and @entity9 is beginning to worry that the ‘ @entity43 ’ might happen again			2
in the zone : the current @entity9 @entity6 squad are focused on avoided a repeat of the 1982 fiasco thursday sees the current @entity3 side play their final group game of the 2014 tournament			1
a draw would see both teams progress , with @entity9 topping the group			1
the fear of a repeat of @entity30 is not as irrational as it might seem			1
@entity9 and the @entity52 are practically cousins in footballing terms			1
in @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 and @entity64 , the @entity52 have five squad members who played in the @entity67 last season			2
all five of them were born in @entity9 , and three of them - @entity61 , @entity62 and @entity63 – played for @entity3 national youth teams , before deciding to switch allegiances to the @entity52			1
@entity61 even won a major trophy with the @entity73			0
in 2009 , he conquered @entity74 alongside @entity75 , @entity76 and @entity77 , all of whom he will meet again on thursday			0
and who could forget the coach ? @entity81 is not just a @entity3 , he is the man who , between 2004 and 2006 , revolutionised the @entity3 national team			0
he laid the foundations for the exciting , youthful @entity9 set up we see today			2
after the 2006 @entity6 he handed the reins to his right hand man : @entity87			2
switching allegiances : @entity52 's @entity64 ( left ) and @entity60 ( right ) were both born in @entity9 @entity81 and @entity87 belong together			1
they are @entity90 and @entity81 : the stylish revolutionaries , who still stay in touch , sharing tips and keeping each other on their toes			0
as far as their next encounter goes , however , all parties insist that there will be no @entity30 - style pact between the two teams			1
@entity81 has said that he and @entity100 have not contacted each other			0
‘ this is no time to be calling your friends			0
it ’s down to business			0
we will do everything to beat @entity9 , ’ said the @entity52 coach			1
dynamic duo : @entity87 ( left ) and @entity111 ( right ) worked together between 2004 and 2006 in the @entity3 camp , the party line is much the same			0
@entity87 ’s assistant @entity114 reminded reporters that the @entity52 had been seconds away from qualification against @entity118 , before the @entity119 clinched a late equaliser			2
‘ for that reason , we will do everything to avoid a draw			2
’ defender @entity124 was quick to back his bosses up			0
‘ it would be horribly unsporting if we were to play for the draw			2
that ’s not how we play			0
‘ that ’s not to say i ’m going to be taking on four players on my own in the 91st minute , though , ’ @entity124 added , ‘ though i might take on one or two ’			0
heartbreak : @entity52 were seconds away from qualifying to the last - 16 of the @entity6 before @entity118 equalised the @entity3 press have certainly made it clear to their team that they will not accept another sporting disgrace against the @entity52 , with @entity30 dominating headlines in the build up to thursday ’s game			1
the ‘ @entity146 ’ ran with the ominous headline ‘ scandal on the mind ’ , while ‘ @entity144 ’ simply pleaded ‘ anything but another @entity30 ’			1
if the @entity3 side needed any other reminder not to repeat the antics of their predecessors , the luck of the draw has also given them a serendipitous heads up			2
should @entity9 win the group as expected , they are likely to play @entity25 in the second round			1
no matter what happens against the @entity52 , the @entity157 would surely enjoy a chance to avenge the insult of 1982 .			1

@entity9 play @entity52 in their final @entity163 game on thursday
a draw would see both teams qualify for the last - 16 stage of the @entity6
@entity9 are keen for the win and avoid a repeat the 1982 scandal
@entity9 beat @entity11 1 - 0 in @entity30 to qualify for the next stage
the tame match saw both sides progress and *infamously* knock out @entity25
