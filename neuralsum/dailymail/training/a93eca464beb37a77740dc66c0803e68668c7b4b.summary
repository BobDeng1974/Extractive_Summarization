by @entity0 published : 09:24 est , 17 february 2014 @entity2 : 13:41 est , 17 february 2014 @entity3 rarely puts on a show without a hidden political agenda , and the @entity7 collection proved no different			1
rather than a discreet nod towards her protest , @entity3 stamped the words , ‘ fracking we need to talk ’ , across the invitations , and with every guest clutching one , her point was surely made			1
front row seats were occupied by quirky dressers such as @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20 who were seen giggling together on the front row			2
the privileged woman was the inspiration behind @entity3 's @entity7 collection triangle print tights and large @entity28 style hats were major trends in the collection the collection itself had @entity3 written all over it with glorious tartan featuring heavily as well as folded tailoring and bulging cleavages evoking classic @entity3 womanly design			1
@entity3 ’s @entity7 line is inspired by women born into a privileged world , which showed in the lady - like ensembles of the collection			1
mid-length dresses paired with oversized wool coats and ankle socks gave a chic suburban edge while lashings of pearls and faux fur coats gave a nod to the @entity7 inspiration of the privileged woman			1
although there are none of the explicit doodles printed on t - shirts as seen in previous seasons , @entity3 is never satisfied with a run - of - the - mill design and each piece had a hint of mischief			1
the @entity62 collection showcased a softer side of @entity3 the collection displayed a cheekier take on lady - like dressing with bustles sewn into mini skirts this season @entity3 wanted to draw attention to fracking inviting guests to a @entity71 highlights included miniature bustles sewn into the backs of mini skirts ( several worn without underwear ) as well as a loose - knit cardigan dress worn with nothing underneath giving peaks of bare flesh			1
the collection also featured the newly trending @entity28 style hat as seen on the likes of @entity84 ; recently earning it ’s fashion status on the catwalk of @entity86 during @entity87			1
we anticipate that it ’s only a matter of time before the oversized headgear it filters down to the @entity92			2
although @entity3 says the woman who inspires @entity7 is privileged she says that this does not prevent her from having a conscience adding that she is ‘ engaged with the world and cares about it			1
’ in hopes to raise awareness about the fracking , @entity3 invited all of her guests to the @entity104 on 19th march at 12:30pm , meeting point at @entity108 's @entity107 station			1
@entity18 and @entity20 were seen bonding on the front row @entity110 is the king of cool			2
his @entity112 collection of hypnotic neons , inky black patents and feminine floral lace prints , has fast become a fashion week favourite			1
but @entity110 did n't want the hair and make - up to distract from his 54 fabric strong organza dresses			2
' most young designers do n't want a huge focus on the hair , they fit the girl to the clothes and want a look that makes the clothes look easier , ' @entity119 , @entity120 , told us backstage			2
' @entity110 did n't want anything too forceful so i 've given his models simple , natural hair			0
it 's very undone hair with a great shine and matte texture			0
' @entity120 spritzed on some @entity119 shine flash to give it a more lanky feel			0
' i did n't want much body , nothing too romantic , but something cooler , he said			0
' this look is all the things a women dreams of becoming ; you can be who you want to be , with a little tweaking			0
' as for the make - up , @entity150 supremo @entity149 gave @entity110 's models a ' glowing tomboy look '			0
' it 's @entity155 meets tomboy			0
the emphasis is on the eyebrows , i 've made them straight and filled them in to achieve a straight , bushy and rather dark look , ' she explained			2
the skin was luminous , simply a swash of the brand 's @entity164 and @entity166 to highlight and give that ' glow coming out of the darkness			0
' the eyes were pink and silvery and @entity149 carried the pink shadow down to the ball of the nose , the @entity169 's bow and chin to give that radiant lightness			0
lips were pink , fresh and a little bit matte , courtesy of @entity180			0
' this girl is very @entity110			0
she 's a cool girl , it 's all very " him " , ' added @entity149 .			0

@entity3 based her collection around the privileged woman
the collection was made up of feminine pieces with a cheeky twist
highlights included mini skirts with bustles and @entity28 hats
@entity3 hopes her collection will raise awareness of fracking
