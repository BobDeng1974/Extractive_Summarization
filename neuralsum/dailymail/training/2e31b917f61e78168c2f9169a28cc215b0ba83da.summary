@entity0 has urged @entity2 fans to take destiny into their own hands by throwing their financial muscle behind one of two fan ownership schemes			1
@entity0 , who together with @entity8 and @entity9 , is seeking a place on the @entity12 board at a forthcoming @entity13 , has taken out life membership of both the @entity15 and @entity2 first			1
with the @entity15 enjoying contributions from over 3,000 members and @entity2 first members now numbering 4200 , the prospect of fans holding the balance of power in determining boardroom change is growing by the day			2
former director @entity0 has asked supporters to take their own control of @entity2 ' destiny @entity0 ( right ) has taken out lifetime membership with both the @entity15 and @entity27 and , with the current incumbents fighting for survival at the @entity13 , the former @entity12 director is imploring each disgruntled supporter to vote with their pocket by joining the growing number seeking meaningful change via the mass purchase of shares			1
a statement on behalf of @entity0 read : ‘ i have today taken out life membership of both the @entity15 and @entity2 first			1
whilst i would like to make special mention of the @entity15 , who have supported our cause tirelessly over the last few years , i wish to make it known that i fully support these two groups in their desire to help safeguard the future of our club			2
‘ along with many of the people who have been working behind the scenes to ensure @entity2 can again function fully , both on and off the pitch , i believe the supporters should be able to participate significantly in the club ’s rehabilitation			2
‘ @entity8 , @entity9 and i are committed to introducing meaningful fan ownership and representation at the club and that is one of the reasons i have pledged my support to both groups			1
‘ @entity15 and @entity27 have bought not insignificant amounts of shares and must be recognised by those of us who are striving to remove the current directors and begin the process of repairing the considerable damage caused by a constantly changing @entity71			1
the future of the @entity74 giants remains uncertain following continuing financial problems @entity2 players applaud the fans after their match with @entity79 was abandoned at the weekend ‘ @entity80 and not the needs of individuals must be put back to the top of the priority list and the supporters can help us achieve that goal			2
@entity27 and @entity15 will always have the best interests of their club at heart and they deserve as much support as we can give			1
‘ i would urge as many of this club ’s fans to sign up to either one or both if possible			0
the fans can play a hugely significant part in forcing change through votes			0
‘ they are the most loyal supporters any club could wish for but have been disregarded by a succession of directors in recent years , and i for one recognise their contribution in the struggle to end the disgrace and level of mismanagement within @entity12			2
‘ there is now a demand for a general meeting and our fans can make a difference in that process , which hopefully will bring about the changes necessary			0
we have seen what happens when directors with no feel , no understanding and no real concern for @entity2 are in control			0
’ no date has yet been set for the egm which ordinarily must be called within 42 days			0
the board has stated it plans to resist the requisition on the grounds that @entity8 is n’t fit to be a director due to his convictions for contravening @entity128 income tax law			1
rangers have been sent into further disarray following the resignation of caretaker boss @entity132 @entity0 , though , says the wider fan - base must be prepared to stand strong in the face of a war of words that ’s only going to intensify			1
‘ in the lead up to the @entity13 the usual suspects will attempt to undermine our cause because they realise their days could be numbered , ’ the statement went on			0
‘ the truth is that for the first time in years there is a group of people capable of rebuilding and repairing our club and malicious speculation will not deflect us			0
‘ @entity2 have to re-engage with @entity74 football and take our place again at the top table			0
‘ we need to be financially stable again and accept our responsibilities to the game in general			0
@entity156 will come and we can all emerge from a black period in this fantastic club ’s history			0
