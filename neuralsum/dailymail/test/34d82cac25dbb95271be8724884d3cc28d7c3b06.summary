will @entity63 - @entity44 1:44.564 ' we are experimenting with a few things , but i think for now we have to go back to what we know , get our basics right , ' said @entity0			1
' we have done quite a bit			0
in @entity17 we had brake issues , a lot of overheating , so we have reverted back on a few things , even from last year which we knew was more efficient			0
' just because it 's from last year it does n't mean it 's not better , so i guess we have taken a step back in that direction			0
the team has done quite a lot to rectify some issues and get us further up the grid			0
' @entity0 has no doubt @entity27 are also pulling their weight , adding : ' from @entity84 to @entity17 they made a pretty massive step with driveability			1
' we also have a few more software things this weekend , which should give things another pretty significant step on that side			0
' i appreciate what everyone is doing to get us back towards the front , so fingers crossed it can be put together in the right way this weekend and if so we can get back into that top five			0
' @entity47 was forced to pull off track 19 minutes from the end of @entity100 after his brakes caught fire team - mate @entity47 , however , was not so fortunate as the young @entity103 was forced to pull off track 19 minutes from the end of @entity100 after his brakes caught fire			1
@entity106 said : ' something overheated within the rear hub assembly			0
as a result of that we lost pressure in the master cylinder halfway round the lap. ' we asked him to drive back slowly without using the brakes if at all possible , but unfortunately he had to brake at turn 14 and he had a very slow off			0
' it 's frustrating it 's happened , but all the relevant pieces are intact so we can find out what the root cause was			0
' despite suffering brake issues in @entity17 , @entity106 insists the issue there and the one experienced by @entity126 are ' totally unrelated '			0
@entity106 added : ' today was a one - off and can be sorted for tomorrow			0
