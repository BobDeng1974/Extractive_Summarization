by @entity0 little did @entity1 and @entity2 realise when they celebrated their @entity5 titles at the @entity6 last year that they would soon have something else in common - coach @entity8			1
@entity8 was in @entity1 ’s corner when she unexpectedly won @entity5 as a 125 - 1 outsider at the age of 28 , and now she has been handpicked by @entity2 to help him retain his singles title at @entity13 in a week ’s time			1
it is a decision that has caused shockwaves throughout the sporting world - the first time a leading men ’s player has appointed a woman to be his coach			1
but @entity1 , able to give a unique insight into how the 34 - year - old works , believes it is a move that will allow @entity2 to cope with the added pressure of being the first @entity26 to try and retain the men ’s singles title at @entity5 since @entity28 in the @entity29			1
happy times ahead : @entity2 's decision to appoint @entity8 as his coach was brave but not surprising says last year 's @entity5 champion @entity31 before and after : @entity8 took over coaching @entity31 ( right ) just months before her @entity5 win , just as the @entity34 coach has done this year for @entity2 @entity1 says : ‘ i think it was an extremely brave choice by @entity2 because it ’s the first time it ’s happened			1
but i am not surprised by it because @entity2 is so smart and he ’s never been afraid of taking risks			2
‘ it ’s the right decision			0
@entity8 was an important reason why i became a @entity5 champion			2
‘ one of her main strengths is how she is able to deal with stress and transmit positive energy to her players			0
she has experience of winning @entity49 herself			0
she is able to give great tactical advice without being in your face all the time			0
she ’s got the presence where she does n’t have to speak too often but when she does , you automatically listen			0
’ @entity1 only appointed @entity8 to replace her father as main coach four months before last year ’s @entity5 and the impact was immediate			1
‘ she did n’t like me getting ready for each match too early , ’ @entity1 says			0
‘ we ’d do a little bit on tactics the night before , she ’d ask how i was feeling about my game , but generally it was n’t anything intense			0
then 25 minutes before the match , the real warm - up began and you become this competitive tennis player			0
’ for those who worry that @entity8 might be too austere for @entity2 ’s quirky sense of humour , @entity1 assures us the @entity34 is a relaxed figure away from the public gaze , a bit like @entity2 ’s previous coach @entity77 who was a joker off - court while maintaining his stonewall persona when the cameras were on him watching matches			1
calming influence : @entity1 , celebrating her 2013 @entity5 final win with @entity8 , has sung the coach 's praise @entity1 adds : ‘ she really is a lot of fun			1
our thing we ’d do was to mimic pieces of dialogue in famous @entity34 films			0
it was all spontaneous , and would keep the tension away			0
’ pyschologically , @entity8 ’s input was most keenly felt 12 months ago when @entity1 came through a rain - interrupted quarter - final against @entity96 ’s @entity95			1
at one point , they were off court for two hours , @entity1 winning the key points when they resumed , one a 27 - shot rally on her way to a 6 - 4 7 - 5 victory			0
‘ @entity8 just kept me relaxed , assured me i was playing well , that if i kept the ball in play , i ’d win , ’ explains @entity1			1
‘ looking back , it was a big part of my success			0
@entity2 ’s decision to have a woman in charge of his preparations will be one of the most - scrutinised stories of @entity5 , particularly after his early exit at @entity115			1
@entity117 player @entity116 spoke for the sceptics last week when he said : ‘ for me , i could n’t do it ( appoint a female coach ) since i do n’t think that highly of the women ’s game			2
’ ladies in his life : @entity2 's girlfriend @entity125 ( right ) shares a laugh with @entity2 's coach @entity8 it ’s ironic that @entity34 is at the centre of a new era in sport when it ’s not historically been regarded as a bastion of women ’s liberation			1
@entity34 @entity134 football team @entity133 appointed a female coach , @entity135 , as their manager in may – the highest - profile club ever to do so			2
now , a @entity34 @entity8 has been entrusted with @entity2 ’s @entity5 chances			1
‘ the message is extremely positive , ’ says @entity1			0
‘ i am very proud to be @entity34 at a time when our country is getting more women involved in sport			2
’ more modestly , @entity1 ca n’t say whether her own experiences with @entity8 helped persuade @entity2 to appoint her , though it should be pointed out @entity1 is good friends with the player ’s mother , @entity148			1
while @entity2 will begin his @entity5 defence a week on monday , @entity1 will be a spectator , having decided to retire after winning her maiden @entity49			2
she has been invited into the @entity151 on tuesday			0
‘ last year was a happy time - an amazing feeling of fun , ’ she recalls			0
something she hopes @entity8 can transmit to @entity2 this year			2
to purchase tickets for the @entity156 international tournament ( june 19 - 22 ) , featuring @entity1 , go to @entity157			2

@entity8 coached @entity1 to the @entity160 women 's championship
the @entity34 coach and former world no 1 is the first woman to have been appointed coach of a top men 's player
@entity8 took over as @entity2 's coach before the tournament at @entity115 's
@entity1 said his appointment of @entity8 was brave but not a surprise
