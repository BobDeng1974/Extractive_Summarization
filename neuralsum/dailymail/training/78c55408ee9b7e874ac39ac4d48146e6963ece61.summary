by @entity0 published : 17:22 est , 2 may 2013 updated : 17:24 est , 2 may 2013 chief constable @entity1 , of the @entity2 , denied a growing culture of secrecy nearly a third of police forces are keeping secret the names of suspects even after they have been charged			2
a survey by the @entity11 has revealed that 14 out of 43 constabularies in @entity13 and @entity14 will not name individuals when they are formally charged with a crime			1
the figures fly in the face of claims from senior officers that the service is ‘ more open than ever ’			1
the survey was carried out after one force , @entity23 , sparked outrage with a decision to wrap charging decisions in secrecy rules as a result of the @entity29			2
the force announced the move in a footnote to a press release on wednesday as it charged a former officer with the theft of £ 113,000 from police headquarters			2
mps and free speech campaigners described it as an ‘ extremely worrying ’ precedent			1
yesterday the force carried out an abrupt u-turn and identified the man as @entity44 , 54 , from @entity45 , @entity46			0
he had already been named by the @entity47			0
the senior police officer responsible for tightening the rules on how police interact with the media took to the airwaves to claim @entity23 had ‘ corrected ’ its position and insisted ‘ people who are charged will be named ’			1
chief constable @entity1 , of the @entity2 , denied the case reflected a growing culture of secrecy			0
‘ we are more open than ever , ’ he told @entity58 ’s @entity59			1
‘ we engage with the public via the traditional media and social media in a way we ’ve never done before			1
' what we are trying to encourage is an open and transparent relationship with the media , not one that has been characterised in the past by secret deals and sometimes , unfortunately , corruption , but one which is absolutely transparent			0
’ but a survey carried out by the @entity11 yesterday revealed the @entity2 guidance is being ignored or defied			1
fourteen forces said they did not name individuals on the day they laid criminal charges			1
many said they would not give out a name until the day before the suspect appeared in court			0
even then , many would only give a surname to allow the @entity82 to identify the individual from the court list			0
this was the position adopted by @entity23 on wednesday night , when it said it would identify the man ahead of his court appearance later this month if journalists called up the day before			0
yesterday the force was hit by a torrent of complaints and performed a u-turn			0
the force was criticised by its own deputy police and crime commissioner , @entity95 , who said : ‘ the commissioner is demanding a full and frank report on all of the circumstances that led to this decision , and we will be seeking assurances that in future all national guidelines are adhered to			1
’ on wednesday night , after the story broke , deputy chief constable @entity103 took to @entity105 to defend the policy			2
he wrote : ‘ the policy was recently changed to align with national policy post @entity107 ( sic ) and not because of today ’s outcome			2
’ it follows @entity112 ’s report which called for a ban on the press and public being told by the police when someone has been arrested , except in exceptional circumstances yesterday the @entity47 said it would name anyone charged with a criminal offence on the day the charging decision was made , unless there were ‘ exceptional circumstances ’			1
mr @entity1 is drawing up draconian new rules that would ban forces from naming anyone who has been arrested , even by way of confirming a name a journalist already has			0
it follows @entity112 ’s report which called for a ban on the press and public being told by the police when someone has been arrested , except in exceptional circumstances			0
it did not go as far as suggesting the ban should apply to suspects who have been charged			0
and the government ’s own legal adviser , the @entity139 , has said police should name the arrested party when journalists request an identity			0
in its statement , a @entity145 spokesman said : ‘ we will be adopting the national @entity2 guidance in respect to naming individuals on charge			1
we apologise that our previous approach has not been consistent with this			0
’ @entity155 of @entity156 said : ‘ that the police should withhold the name of a former officer who has not only been arrested but charged is of concern			1
in certain cases , it may be appropriate to preserve anonymity but a policy of secrecy reverses the principle of open justice that we have in the @entity168			0
’ last night @entity44 , who runs a financial investigation training company , said : ‘ i have been told by my solicitor not to say anything about this			1
the whole thing has been so stressful for me and my family ’ .			2

14 out of 43 constabularies in @entity13 and @entity14 will not name individuals
mps and free speech campaigners call it an ‘ extremely worrying ’ precedent
