in the midst of a grueling , final - hour push by @entity3 to rescue the economy from the looming fiscal cliff , house speaker @entity0 sought brief reprieve with an evening of margaritas and @entity9 fare in @entity10 , a source told @entity12			1
dressed in a festive , bright red sweater , a cheery @entity0 arrived through a side door at @entity15 's in @entity16 around 7:15 p.m. friday - about three hours after he left stone - faced from a meeting at the @entity18 with other congressional leaders and president @entity20 - according to a diner who happened to arrive at the restaurant around the same time			1
accompanying @entity0 to his table friday were about six men - all security detail - who stood behind him for about 30 seconds and then sat down at a table nearby , said the diner , who works in government and said she wished to remain anonymous			1
house speaker @entity0 , @entity32 , was spotted at @entity33 in @entity10 friday evening drinking margaritas with a group of three after his night at @entity15 's , @entity0 returned to @entity36 , where senators were working on a solution to avert the fiscal cliff @entity0 was drinking margaritas while most of his party - two men and one woman - were drinking beer and sangria , the source said			1
they were all chomping on chips and salsa at the table			0
other diners in the restaurant recognized the @entity0 and approached his table to say hello , the source noted			1
@entity0 was ' very friendly to anyone that went up and spoke to him , ' she said			1
despite the long weekend of work ahead of him , ' he and his group were laughing and having a good time , ' the source said			0
several times throughout the evening @entity0 stepped outside - through the side door - to take smoke breaks with some of his security detail , she added			1
' we saw him walking out when we were leaving at 8:30 , ' she said			0
' we passed two of his detail driving away then so we assumed he was leaving for the night , but it could have just been another smoke break			2
' meanwhile , on saturday , @entity68 leaders were working feverishly in private for a last - hour budget solution that could prevent the fiscal cliff - a package of tax increases for the middle class tax and deep spending cuts - from being triggered at dawn on @entity77			2
senate majority leader @entity78 , a @entity79 , and @entity68 minority leader @entity80 , a @entity81 , are trying to find a solution in time for votes sunday night by both houses			2
whatever manages to pass in the @entity68 , with its @entity86 majority , would then face a second test in the @entity81 - controlled @entity88			0
@entity0 arrived at the restaurant through a side door about three hours after he left a @entity18 meeting on the fiscal cliff , and he 'd changed out of his work clothes and into a festive red sweater @entity0 and his party at @entity15 's were ' laughing and having a good time ' - a far cry from how he appeared after his meeting at the @entity18 hours earlier @entity0 , a @entity81 speaker who has struggled recently with anti-tax rebels inside his own party , said through an aide that he would await the results of the talks between the @entity68 and @entity18			1
with the deadline for action fast approaching , @entity20 reiterated his demand for @entity3 to strike a deal that would prevent taxes from rising on the middle class			0
' it 's a balanced plan — one that would protect the middle class , cut spending in a responsible way , and ask the wealthiest @entity116 to pay a little more , ' @entity20 said in his weekly radio address			2
' and i 'll keep working with anybody who 's serious about getting a comprehensive plan like this done — because it 's the right thing to do for our economic growth			2
' @entity20 is expected to renew his demands during a rare appearance on @entity128 's ' @entity127 ' on sunday			0
in a rebuttal to @entity20 on saturday , republicans held their ground on their view of how the fiscal cliff should be resolved			0
' the president 's proposal to raise taxes on the top 2 percent of @entity116 wo n't even pay one - third of the annual interest that 's now owed on this massive $ 16 trillion debt , ' sen. @entity133 , @entity134 , said			0
' we still can avoid going over the fiscal cliff if the president and the @entity79 - controlled @entity68 step forward this week and work with @entity81 to solve this problem and solve it now			0
