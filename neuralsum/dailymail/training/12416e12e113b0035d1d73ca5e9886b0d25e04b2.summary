by @entity0 published : 12:49 est , 27 december 2012 updated : 06:18 est , 2 april 2013 still standing and still in every - day use - the arched wooden bridges built in @entity2 nearly 1,000 years ago demonstrate the true skill of the master craftsmen who first constructed them			1
these stunning structures show how not every part of @entity2 has been altered by its remarkable rate of development			2
the bridges , suspended between two banks of lush greenery and built from the wood of the trees surrounding them , are still a fully functional part of life in the @entity18 and @entity19 provinces along @entity2 's south east coast			1
still in use : a man walks across the @entity24 timber arch lounge bridge , in the @entity26 village of @entity27 , which was built during the @entity28 amazing structures : the @entity24 bridge , right , and the @entity32 bridge , left are both prime examples of the ' beam - weaving ' bridge building method where horizontal ' beams ' are supported by piers at each end protected : the bridges , including the @entity24 bridge pictured , have been listed as one of the state 's key cultural relics of the 100 woven arched timber ' lounge bridges ' in @entity2 , 19 of them are in the @entity27 of the @entity45 province alone - including the @entity32 bridge , in the village of @entity47 , and the @entity24 bridge , in nearby @entity26			1
the @entity50 bridge meanwhile , in the @entity52 village , in @entity53 , also in the @entity45 province is even older , having been built during the @entity55 which lasted from 1127 to 1279			0
again the bridge , which is an impressive 62.7 metres long and 4.9 metres wide , has been rebuilt several times , but remains an iconic image of ancient @entity2 construction methods			2
both of the bridges have been listed as one of the state 's key cultural relics , while the @entity65 website has said the traditional methods for building the bridges on @entity2 's south east coast , has declined in recent years because of the country 's rapid urbanisation			1
the building of the bridges relies on a skilled craftsmanship , with a woodworking master directing the carpentry of a team of woodworkers			0
idyllic : the @entity79 , a timber arch lounge bridge , in the @entity47 village in south east @entity2 still standing : the @entity82 , in the village of @entity52 , which was built during the @entity55 , which began in 1127 this craftsmanship has been passed on down the years from one generation to another by masters teaching apprentices or relatives within a clan following strict procedures			1
the clans then play a vital role in the building , maintenance and protection of the bridges			0
the historical bridges also play an important role within the cultural life of the areas they have been built in , providing meeting places for residents to exchange information , worship and entertain			2
reaching over time : the @entity108 is 47.6 meters long and 4.9 meters wide throughout the years : the skills and knowledge needed to maintain the bridges has been passed on through the generations the bridges , included on @entity65 's @entity114 of @entity115 , are built entirely by hand using the skill of ' beam - weaving ' and creating mortise and tenon joints			1
the woodworking masters design the bridges with a range of arches depending on the surroundings , while the passageways can be of various styles , depending on the use of the bridge			0
to create arch support , ' beam weaving ' is used which sees three rows of wood formed into an arch - supporting system while in the upper layer five shorter rows of wood are jointed and intertwined with upper - arch supports			0
@entity139 that then connects the whole bridge is placed at the joints between the ends so the bridge becomes a solid whole			0
traditional tools such as @entity148 rulers , sawhorses , axes and chisels were used in the construction of the bridges			0
a glimpse into the past : the bridges offer us a peak into the @entity2 of years gone by , while still managing to serve the country in the modern day			2

the wooden bridges in south east @entity2 have been listed as cultural relics
