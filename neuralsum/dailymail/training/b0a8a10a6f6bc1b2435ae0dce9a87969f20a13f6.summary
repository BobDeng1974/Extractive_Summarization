@entity0 spent years trying to decipher crop circles amid fears they were being used to guide @entity4 bombers , secret documents from the @entity6 have revealed			1
the files , held in the @entity8 , show how @entity10 spies suspected @entity4 sympathisers were sending secret messages to the enemy using ground markings			1
among the suspected codes was a mysterious marking in a cornfield that was shaped like the letter ' g ' , with its tail appearing to point to a munitions factory in @entity21 , @entity22			1
the @entity10 security service had started looking into the marks after learning that in @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52 , cornfields had been cut into ' guiding marks for aircraft ' , with spies beating out marks to assist @entity58 pilots find their targets			1
fearing that a ' @entity60 ' of @entity4 sympathisers were working inside @entity10 , @entity0 dedicated agents to investigating reports of suspected enemy activity , including ' cornfield codes ' spotted in fields			1
the files , held in the @entity8 , show how @entity10 spies suspected @entity4 sympathisers were sending secret messages to the enemy using ground markings , such as these discovered in a farmer 's field in 1940 @entity0 started looking into the marks after learning that in @entity74 , cornfields were cut into ' guiding marks for aircraft ' , with spies beating out marks to help @entity58 pilots ( pictured ) find their targets ' they began investigating into the @entity79 after the invasion of the @entity81 and @entity51 where @entity83 spies had used landing lights to guide them to the places where the @entity86 wanted to attack , ' said dr @entity87 , senior lecturer in journalism at @entity89 who has studied the files for his book @entity10 's @entity92			1
' in 1940 , everyone in @entity10 thought " we 're next " , and that @entity83 would have recruited spies in @entity95 as well who would be sending messages to the @entity83 and marking places out where landings could be made			1
' the @entity83 @entity102 led people , including the police , @entity101 and @entity0 to suspect there was an active @entity105 and there is an @entity0 file in the @entity8 that 's absolutely full of weird things that were brought to their attention			2
' the @entity0 report into the markings discovered at @entity113 , @entity22 , which turned out to have been made accidentally by a farmer trying to get rid of a supply of barley seed it was feared that @entity58 pilots flying over @entity10 could be guided to targets with messages on the ground included in the file is the report from the marking found in the field at @entity113 , @entity22 in 1941			1
it stated that the 33 yards long shape had been made by ' sowing barley seeds transversely through the grain ' , and the tail of the @entity131 was pointing towards the munitions factory in nearby @entity21			1
' in may 1941 a report was made that an unusual mark was visible amongst the growing corn			0
near one of the gates was a mark in the form of the letter @entity131 , some 33 yards long			2
this mark had been made by sowing barley transversely through the grain			2
' ' air photographs were taken and it was seen that the tail of the marking pointed towards the @entity147 at @entity21			2
the farmer , a man of good character , was interviewed , and admitted that he had sown the field himself			2
he explained that he had sold the field in april			0
' shortly after , having a drilling machine nearby which had a small quantity of barley seed in it , and wishing to empty it as he had to return it to the farmer from whom he had borrowed it that night , he turned his team of horses into the grain field and drilled it into the ground thickly to get rid of it			1
he did this because it is extremely difficult to remove the grain in the machine by hand , and to sow it was the quickest way of getting rid of it			2
' he agreed to plough up this part of the field			0
as a satisfactory explanation had been reached , the case was carried no further			0
' ' it was spotted from the air by the @entity180 pilot who had been given instructions to look for anything suspicious , ' dr @entity87 told @entity183			2
' a farmer had left a " g " shape and it just so happened that the tail of the @entity131 was pointing towards an ordnance factory			1
' when the @entity180 saw that from the air they thought it was a @entity83 spy and the poor farmer was surrounded by @entity0 agents			0
' but there was a perfectly innocent explanation			0
' it transpired the farmer had sown the barley seed in order to get rid of it , having sold his farm and needing to return a drilling seed he had borrowed			1
likewise , a marking in a field in @entity34 was discovered to have been made by heaps of lime used for agricultural purposes , and the @entity38 sign in @entity40 had been left behind from its days as an emergency landing ground by @entity209 , which eventually though a number of mergers became @entity212			0
' in the files are a number of things that if people had seen them recently would be thought of as alien activity such as lights in the sky or crop circles , ' said dr @entity87			0
' in 1940 , people were n't pre-occupied with @entity223 , they were pre-occupied with @entity86			0
' the amount of time and energy that @entity0 put into investigating these reports is astonishing			0
they had three officers full time based in the eastern counties looking for lights in the sky they thought were agents signalling to @entity83 aircraft " this way to @entity234 "			0
' he added : ' when people are worried , like they are now with the possibility of @entity240 terrorism , they can interpret normal things as signs that horrible things are going to happen			0
' that 's why @entity0 is interested in things like sightings of flying saucers - but they are interested in the fact there may be more grounded reasons for them			0

files in @entity8 show @entity10 spies ' fears over @entity4 sympathisers
they suspected ' @entity60 ' was sending messages to @entity58
among suspicious ' cornfield codes ' was a ' g ' shape in @entity22
tail of the @entity131 pointed to a munitions factory nearby
but it transpired it was caused by farmer trying to get rid of barley stock
