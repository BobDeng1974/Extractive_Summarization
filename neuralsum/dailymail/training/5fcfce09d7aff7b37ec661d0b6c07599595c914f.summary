on the mend : @entity197 carer @entity196 says that the kitten has made a remarkable recovery in the space of just a couple of weeks near miss : the kitten still bears the scars of the shot which narrowly missed his eye ' we could feel there was a lump under his chin , which is probably the pellet and inflammation , but decided that he was too young to operate on and because it was n’t causing him any trouble at the moment , we could wait until he was a bit older			2
' we syringe - fed him and the next day he was a lot better , even quite playful			0
he ’s a lovely little thing			0
