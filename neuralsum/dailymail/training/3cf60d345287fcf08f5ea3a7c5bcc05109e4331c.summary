by @entity0 published : 08:12 est , 8 march 2013 updated : 13:56 est , 8 march 2013 two investors who bought a dilapidated cottage for $ 300,000 are set to make a $ 30million profit on the deal after discovering an amazing haul of lost artwork by a previous resident			1
@entity8 and @entity9 snapped up the bungalow on @entity12 's @entity11 in 2007 intending to do it up and sell it on for around $ 100,000 more than they paid			1
but they found thousands of abstract paintings and drawings by @entity21 - @entity20 artist @entity19 , who lived in the house for decades but never received critical recognition during his lifetime			1
six years after the stunning discovery , the work has been valued at $ 30 million and some of the works have gone on display in a @entity30 gallery where he had always dreamed of exhibiting			1
thousands of pieces had been stored there since @entity19 's death in 1999 aged 85			1
but instead the canny investors agreed to buy the art for $ 2,500 - though more out of sympathy than with an eye to making money			1
' i did n't want to be the person responsible for throwing a man 's life 's work into a dumpster , ' mr @entity8 told @entity67			0
' someone 's life 's work deserved more than that			0
' stash : @entity19 's relatives said they could just throw the works away but the buyers could not do it a life 's work : @entity19 spent years copying famous artists ' work to teach himself the craft ' thrilled ' : @entity8 said he could not bear to throw away all of the artwork when it was found @entity19 may have been dubbed one of the best abstract painters of his era , but it was an accolade he did not live to enjoy			1
instead , the @entity21 - @entity20 artist , who died in 1999 aged 85 , was better known as a cartoonist in his lifetime			2
he trained himself to draw while growing up in @entity91 , @entity92 , and was active as a comic book artist and creator from the 1930s until the 1950s			2
he found considerable success creating comic strips for @entity98 , @entity99 and @entity100			2
after serving in @entity101 , he began working on his own - devoting himself to studying well - known artists and developing his own style using structural colour			0
but he had little commercial success and largely relied on his sister , a secretary , for financial support			0
the two men started to restore @entity19 's collection , which included abstract expressionist paintings , comic book illustrations and sketches of his fellow @entity101 soldiers			1
in total , they came across 70,000 paintings , sketches and journals of his work			0
as they restored @entity19 's art , his reputation began to grow ; art historian @entity122 recently dubbed him one of the best abstract painters of his era			1
@entity19 's recovered paintings were appraised by @entity126 , a leading author who has previously worked for @entity128 's estate			1
the total value is believed to be around $ 30million			2
however , it could take several decades to sell of all the work			0
nevertheless , ' i was surprised and thrilled ' , mr @entity8 said			0
fifty of the artist 's best works are currently on display in the @entity136 in @entity12			2
@entity19 had long wanted to show his work in the skyscraper , according to mr @entity8			2
' the artist was in the @entity136 in the 1950s when he was visiting an exhibition of @entity142 's works , ' he told @entity67			2
' he talked about how he thought his works were better than @entity142			0
' talent : @entity19 was known as a comic book artist in his lifetime but devoted his later years to abstract work devoted : @entity19 , pictured left aged 18 and right when he served in @entity101 , was a self - taught artist the painter was born in @entity92 in 1914 , and worked as a company clerk and cartoonist before the @entity101			1
afterwards he devoted himself to his art , but had little commercial success and largely relied on his sister , a secretary , for financial support			0
the pair , neither of whom ever married , lived together in @entity158 for nearly three decades			0
his cousin @entity159 said he would be delighted with his posthumous recognition			0
' he thought he was going to be the next @entity161 , ' he told the @entity162 in 2007			0
' they believed he would become famous and this would all pay off for them one day , but it just never happened			0
' better - known work : @entity19 worked as a comic book artist and creator from the 1930s until the 1950s influential : art historian @entity122 has called @entity172 one of the best abstract painters of his era study : he copied @entity176 , impressionists , cubists and @entity179 before establishing his own style influential : art historian @entity122 has called @entity172 one of the best abstract painters of his era			1

two investors bought @entity11 house intending to do it up and sell it on
but they found thousands of works by late artist @entity19 , who used to live there , and they were valued at $ 30 million
they are now at a gallery at which he had dreamed of exhibiting
