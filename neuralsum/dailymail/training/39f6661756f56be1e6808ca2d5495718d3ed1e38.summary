@entity9 , 40 , who at one time was a prominent restaurateur with eateries in @entity12 and @entity13 , was held on $ 4million dollar bail following his plea			1
prosecutors say he used misoprostol , a drug known to induce labor or cause early - stage abortions , to terminate his girlfriend 's pregnancy in the fall of 2009			1
he is pictured with @entity26 and @entity27 , who have no connection to the case , at the opening of @entity32 in @entity13 in 2007 @entity9 , who once co-owned @entity34 's exclusive table 8 restaurant and the 8oz			1

@entity9 's then girlfriend contacted the @entity42 after she discovered a mysterious white powder in her underwear in the fall of 2009 after a liaison with @entity47			1
she then described the circumstances of their relationship			0
she said that from the beginning she planned to keep the child but @entity9 was adamant about terminating the pregnancy			2
according to the affidavit obtained by the @entity55 , the pregnancy caused a ' bitter ' breakup of the pair			0
however , @entity9 eventually told the unidentified woman , now 42 , that he wanted to be involved and the pair reunited			1
his then girlfriend told police and prosecutors after they rekindled their relationship , @entity9 would often dip his hand into his backpack or pocket before touching her intimately			2
claim : prosecutors say he used misoprostol , left , a drug known to induce labor or cause early - stage abortions , to terminate his girlfriend 's pregnancy a few hours after an encounter on october 18 , 2009 , she suffered severe cramping and miscarried			1
she later noticed a suspicious white powder substance on her underwear and contacted police			1
they identified the substance as misoprostol			1
@entity82 was initially @entity83 approved for the prevention and treatment of ulcers , but can also be used to induce labor or miscarriages of early - term pregnancies			0
police told her to hide the fact that she had lost the baby and invite @entity9 over			1
when he arrived , he allegedly pulled a small piece of clear plastic with a powdery substance out of his pocket			0
' with his right hand he pulled out a small piece of clear plastic with a white powdery substance from his right front pocket and started grinding the item on his pants just below the pocket , ' a @entity42 detective wrote in the 2009 court paperwork , according to the @entity55			1
investigation : @entity9 turned himself in on wednesday , nearly three years after the allegations first surfaced			2
one of his restaurants , the former table 8 in @entity12 , is pictured the investigation in 2009 did not lead to formal charges and prosecutors have spent years securing evidence in the case			0
investigators spent that time interviewing additional witnesses , combing through medical records and conducting further testing on the powder , according to the @entity122			0
' in the interim , there 's been further investigation and analysis , and we obviously now decided what we deem appropriate charges , ' deputy da @entity123 said to @entity132			0
the @entity122 reports that police have secured ' new evidence ' against @entity9			2
@entity9 's attorney , @entity135 , said there is still no case against his client			2
@entity82 was initially @entity83 approved for the prevention and treatment of ulcers , but can also be used to induce labor or miscarriages of early - term pregnancies			0
the commercial name , @entity82 , carries a label that warns pregnant women not to use the drug to treat ulcers			0
the charges , he said , are an attempt to turn ' an unfortunate natural miscarriage of a 13 - week - old fetus into a ghoulish attempted murder case			1
' ' nothing has changed in the last three years except the prosecution 's determination to blame @entity9 for the miscarriage suffered by his girlfriend , ' mr @entity135 said to the @entity122			2
' the evidence marshaled against him is so weak and speculative as to be nonexistent			0
" his then girlfriend has declined to comment			0
the charges listed on court documents describe four instances from september 15 until october 25 when @entity9 allegedly tried to induce an abortion			1
he is formally charged with ' the crime of attempted , willful , deliberate , and premeditated murder ... a felony , ' the documents state , explicitly claiming that @entity47 ' did unlawfully and with malice aforethought attempt to murder @entity172 , a human fetus			1
' when asked why he was charged only with attempted murder rather than murder , a spokeswoman for @entity175 said ' we file charges based on the evidence			1
that is all we can say			0
' criminal law attorneys interviewed by @entity183 suggested that in order to prove he did commit murder , the district attorney would have to prove the fetus was ' alive			2
' since the fetus was not viable at 13 weeks , that might present a difficulty			0
@entity9 's intent , they said , would be simpler to prove			2
now a @entity193 resident , he faces four counts of life in prison			0
@entity9 is no longer associated with the day - to - day of the restaurants he once co-owned .			0
