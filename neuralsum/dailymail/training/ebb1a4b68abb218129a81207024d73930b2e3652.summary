by @entity0 published : 10:34 est , 18 september 2013 updated : 14:02 est , 18 september 2013 with pits prone to devastating fires , explosions and disasters , coal miners took their lives in their hands when they went to work at the industry 's early 20th century peak			1
in the first two decades of the last century alone some 2,000 miners were killed while at work in 31 major disasters at the coal face			1
and the victims of those disasters were remembered in a macabre and somewhat unusual way - postcards were rushed out to pay tribute to those who died and those who fought to save them			1
tribute : a sepia tinted postcard commemorating the deaths of seven miners killed at the @entity25 in 1907			2
an author has written a history of edwardian mining using a collection of macabre postcards released following disasters tragedy : this simple example of a postcard released following a mining disaster shows the aftermath of an incident at the @entity38 in december 1910 memorial : this postcard commemorates the death of 168 miners in an explosion at the @entity43 in @entity44 dangerous work : a second postcard commemorating the 1909 west @entity48 explosion shows pictures of all 168 people killed , left , while another shows an image of a group of brothers waiting for the body of one of their siblings at a mine in @entity60 author @entity61 has used a postcard collection - many of which were the work of one family - run studio which printed thousands of the sepia - toned tributes - to compile a history of @entity69 mining			1
the @entity70 from @entity71 would often rush out cards just two or three days after a fatal accident below ground			1
some of the examples in mr @entity61 's fascinating book include a disaster at the @entity78 in @entity79 , near @entity80 , @entity81 , which saw 76 men killed in 1908 and a tragic explosion at the @entity43 that saw 168 miners perish in 1909			1
heroes also got recognition for their bravery , courage and sacrifice			0
in the @entity91 disaster in march 1908 , one miner @entity89 lost his life while trying to save of 25 colleagues - ' the @entity95 ' proclaims a postcard tribute to the 31 - year - old			0
inferno : this postcard was brought out after a fire at the @entity101 in 1908 lives lost : an explosion at the @entity78 saw just three miners brought out alive devastating : 76 men lost their lives at the @entity107 in 1908 @entity108 : this postcard commemorates a 1908 disaster at the @entity111 hard working : it was n't just disasters illustrated in the series of postcards			2
this example shows a group of workers plying their trade in 1898 mr @entity61 said : ' the era was the heyday of the picture postcard with hundreds of millions sent every year			2
' coal mining featured heavily - just about every colliery in the country appeared on a postcard featuring mining activity above and below ground			2
' they were collected as mementos - and a small percentage of every one sold for - a penny for a plain one and 2p for a coloured one - went to a fund for the families of those miners who lost their lives			0
' many of the cards were beautifully tinted introducing the life of a collier to an ever - wider audience			0
' and locally - produced cards commemorated major and minor events - including mining disasters which cost hundreds of lives			1
' big business : most of the postcards were produced by a single family - run @entity71 , @entity151 , print studio hero : the funeral of a miner called @entity156 is shown in this example of an @entity69 postcard brave : this postcode shows the streets of an unknown town packed for the funeral of @entity164 who is described as a ' hero ' graphic : unidentified bodies shown after an explosion at the @entity170 in @entity171 the cards are now considered very collectible - some rare examples can fetch as much as £ 100			1
in 1910 the nation ’s dependence on coal was so great there were more than 3,200 collieries in @entity179 producing 264 million tons of the stuff			0
but the industry has been in decline ever since - in 1979 there were 170 working mines producing 130 million tonnes a year			2
going up : workers are brought to the surface after a hard day at the @entity188 helping hand : a pit pony pictured bringing coal to the shaft at the @entity193 and by 2010 the number of pits had shrunk to just three after cheap foreign imported coal decimated the domestic market			0
in the first quarter of 2013 the @entity179 pits still producing dug out around 4 million tonnes - while imports during the same three - month period exceeded 12 million tonnes - 15.8 per cent up on the same period in 2012			0
the book @entity202 is published by @entity203 and costs £ 9.99			0
treacherous : miners are pictured testing the roof to see if it holds at one colliery heavy work : men are pictured digging the coal seam at one of the hundreds of mines across the @entity179			0
