a photographer has used his seven - year - old daughter 's @entity1 to recreate the works of street artist @entity4			1
@entity5 has recreated many of the mysterious street artist 's iconic works from the plastic bricks			1
the 42 - year - old from @entity11 , @entity12 , used his daughter june 's @entity1 to complete the project he calls @entity15			1
@entity5 has recreated many of the street artist 's iconic works like @entity18 which @entity5 calls @entity19 @entity4 's 2007 @entity21 piece , which was an adaptation of a scene from @entity24 's 1994 - cult - classic , @entity23 , showed @entity25 and @entity26 pointing bananas instead of guns highlights include tongue - in - cheek versions of @entity31 , @entity19 and @entity32 - all with @entity5 's own funny captions and embellishments			1
he said : ' the work makes an unexpected connection between @entity4 's street art and @entity1 bricks			2
' there is something compelling about gritty street scenes rendered in clean , modernist @entity1 bricks			2
' for many @entity45 scenes i hope to give viewers an extended story for @entity4 's work , often infused with sideways humour			0
' the iconic bouquet thrower , for example , is revealed to be throwing flowers to his girlfriend in a tale of forbidden love - she happens to be a police officer			0
' @entity4 's girl with @entity61 was one his most talked about pieces of his career - here is @entity5 's adaptation the original work by @entity4 depicts a young girl losing a heart - shaped balloon to the wind @entity5 used his daughter june 's @entity1 to complete the project he calls @entity15 sweep it under the carpet by @entity4 first appeared in @entity74 , @entity75			1
many were quick to claim that this piece was a statement against the government 's reluctance to tackle issues kissing coppers : the police are enthusiastic supporters of stop - and - frisk policies @entity4 's @entity87 piece dates back to 2004 when it appeared on the @entity88 in @entity89 , @entity90			0
the piece depicts two male policemen engaging in a passionate kiss each scene takes @entity5 about a day including @entity1 building and photography			1
he says he typically takes five or six versions of each scene			0
he said : ' a lot of time is spent looking for @entity1 parts , as my daughter has access to the same brick collection , which are technically hers			2
' it is challenging to make gritty street scenes in clean , modernist @entity1 bricks , though there is a fun irony to it			2
i also wanted to do more than a straightforward recreation of @entity4 's work , not always successfully			0
' for example , in @entity114 the scene is zoomed out from @entity4 's original and includes the surrounding trashed buildings and riot police			0
' ' i think of @entity4 as a culture - shifting phenomenon ... not just for his artwork but for his wit and his toying with the art world			0
even his critics can not deny a before - @entity4 and after - @entity4 moment			0
' hanging around : tight pants are not @entity126 's first choice for public display			0
perhaps parachute pants will be a better choice for next time naked @entity131 , 2006 : the husband is pictured looking out the window above the naked man , angrily searching for his wife 's lover the @entity114 : raising a well - presented anarchist has never been easier in these tumultuous times @entity32 : @entity5 's take on @entity140 shows a strong - arm flower deliverer specialising in tragically forbidden love @entity140 : the subject , who appears to be involved in a riot , wears a handkerchief and backwards cap and is depicted armed with a bouquet of flowers instead of a @entity151 cocktail unique : @entity5 's like a @entity153 on a @entity154 is his version of @entity4 's @entity153 just following orders : each scene takes @entity5 about a day including @entity1 building and photography @entity160 : follow your instincts - devour sugar , carbs , and mystery meat whenever you come across them painted @entity167 is a take on @entity4 's @entity167 which appeared in @entity169 in 2011 @entity5 's version of @entity171			1
the title suggests that the subject 's weapon of choice is man 's best friend the piece , often mislabeled , was not a @entity4 / @entity179 collaboration as the latter passed away in 1990 force 5 fridge : @entity5 's version suggests their is a surreal storm approaching deep @entity184 : @entity5 said he wanted to do more than just simply recreate @entity4 's original and some include buildings and other characters in the background urban cowboy : breaking in a spirited stack of bricks can be backbreaking skeleton keys : fuchsia transportation provides an extra bit of shock value for the discriminating undead eye - catching : the @entity198 is in @entity199 , @entity75 and appeared in 2007 photo opportunity : there 's got to be an angle of @entity203 the world has n't seen , though it 's not for lack of trying keep it real : say yes to your inner monkey @entity5 says with this adaptation old skool : you never really know who your future self is going to be			2
it 's probably better that way thug for life : this piece of art shows a group of pensioners with baseball caps and a ghetto blaster monkey business : laugh now , but you 're paying thousands of pounds a year for burnt coffee creative : @entity5 used his daughter june 's @entity1 to complete the project he calls @entity15			1
