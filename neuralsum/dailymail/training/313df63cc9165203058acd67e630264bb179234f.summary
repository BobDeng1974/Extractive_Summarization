fightback : in response to the pink , flabby tubes of paste we serve our children , foodies have launched a movement for real frankfurters - or ' haute dogs ' want to lose your appetite for hot dogs ? then visit a frankfurter factory			1
it ’s an unpleasant business			2
in vast metal vats , tons of pork trimmings are mixed with the pink slurry formed when chicken carcasses are squeezed through metal grates and blasted with water			2
the mush is mixed with powdered preservatives , flavourings , red colouring and drenched in water before being squeezed into plastic tubes to be cooked and packaged			2
it is a disgusting process , for the hot dog is arguably the ultimate in processed , industrial food			1
in response to the pink , flabby tubes of paste we serve our children , foodies have launched a movement for real frankfurters — or ‘ haute dogs ’			1
next month sees the opening of @entity42 , a @entity44 restaurant specialising in hot dogs and @entity46			1
the new generation of sausages are lovingly made from quality cuts , gently seasoned and smoked in the traditional @entity51 way , and smothered with gastro sauces and relishes			2
various @entity51 immigrants then claimed to have introduced the popular snack to @entity63 in the 19th century			2
from there , they have mutated into the processed sausage we know today			1
@entity67 from the food lobby group @entity68 , said : ‘ cheap frankfurters are highly processed and have little in them that will improve your health			1
' if they are eaten on a regular basis , they can not be good for you			1
they are one of the least natural foods i can think of			2
’ and cheap hot dogs do n’t just taste awful			1
eaten in excess , they can be disastrous for your health			1
there is now scientific evidence that hot dogs — like all processed meats — increase the risk of bowel cancer			1
the @entity91 recommends people avoid all processed meats — or cut down if they ca n’t give up their bacon , ham and sausages			1
the fund ’s dr @entity96 said : ‘ if everyone ate less than 70g a week — or two hot dogs — it would mean there would be 4,000 fewer cases of bowel cancer in the @entity103 each year			1
’ so just what goes into the hot dogs to make them such a target for real food campaigners ? meat traditional hot dogs are made from pork trimmings — the pieces left over after chops , bacon and ham has been cut away — along with chicken or turkey			1
the meat is ground into a paste and mixed with water , preservatives , flavouring and colours			2
many @entity103 hot dogs have a similar meat profile			1
appetising ? in vast metal vats , tons of pork trimmings are mixed with the pink slurry formed when chicken carcasses are squeezed through metal grates and blasted with water the @entity134 varieties on sale at @entity136 contain very little real meat			2
instead , they are made up of 64 per cent mechanically - recovered chicken			2
only 17 per cent is pork			2
mechanically - recovered meat is the slimy paste created when a carcass — stripped of all traditional cuts — is forced through a metal sieve or blasted with water			2
the process is banned for beef after the @entity150 scare of the @entity151 , but is permitted for pigs and poultry , and the meat produced is ten times cheaper than normal meat			0
perhaps surprisingly , there is nothing particularly unhealthy about the product , and it ’s approved by the @entity159			0
but under @entity162 food rules , it is not classed as meat and must be labelled as mechanically recovered			0
water much of the water in a hot dog is added to create the right consistency for the mushy paste , which is then squeezed into tubes and cooked			1
it ’s also needed to hold together the frankfurter after cooking			0
starch all sausages — from the cheapest , nastiest brands , to the luxury free - range organic ones — are bulked out with carbohydrate starch			0
hot dogs usually contain potato starch , wheat flour or rusk mixed with salt , baked and crumbled			1
starches give more volume to a hot dog			1
they also bind ingredients together , and make the mechanically - recovered meat and pork trimmings feel more pleasant on the tongue			0
@entity190 hot dogs contain around 2 per cent salt and if eaten in excess can increase your risk of high blood pressure , stroke and heart disease hot dogs contain around 2 per cent salt , which means they are classed as high - salt foods — and if eaten in excess can increase your risk of high blood pressure , stroke and heart disease			1
a single 35g frankfurter has up to 0.6g of salt — one tenth of a teaspoon and one tenth of an adult ’s daily recommended amount			0
children aged four to six should have no more than 3g of salt a day , according to the @entity213 , while children up to three should have no more than 2g			0
according to @entity217 , salty diets increase the risk that children will suffer high blood pressure as adults , and increase the risk of brittle bone disease , asthma , stomach cancer and obesity			0
milk protein adding powdered milk proteins to the meat slurry also helps to bind it			0
there ’s no health risk , unless you are allergic to dairy products			1
some hot dog manufactures use pea and soya protein , which can also bulk out the hot dog , while adding to its protein content			1
@entity241 — sodium nitrite processed meat increases the risk of bowel cancer and sodium nitrite is thought to be largely to blame			1
it is added to hot dogs to stop them going grey , and keep microbes at bay			1
studies on animals have linked sodium nitrites to an increased risk of cancer			0
the @entity91 carried out a global study on the dangers of processed meats and found that people who regularly consume 50g of processed meat a day — equivalent to one - and - a - half hot dogs — increase their chances of getting bowel cancer by 20 per cent			1
the charity believes nitrites are largely to blame			0
in the body , nitrites can react with protein - rich foods such as meat to produce n - nitroso compounds , or @entity272			0
some types of @entity272 damage the dna in our cells and cause cancer			0
in 2006 , scientists analysed more than 60 studies and found that nitrites are also linked to higher risks of stomach cancer			0
flavours by law , hot dog packets do n’t have to say what flavourings are used in them			1
many use artificial smoke flavouring , herbs , spices , celery and garlic powder			0
a few brands use the chemical monosodium glutamate — @entity295 , or @entity295 – to enhance the flavour			0
@entity295 gives food a ‘ meaty ’ feel and is used in soups , sauces and , infamously , @entity302 takeaways			0
@entity295 has been accused of causing allergies , headaches and dehydration			0
however , despite the health scares , there is no hard evidence that @entity295 is bad for you , and it is found naturally in broccoli , mushrooms and tomatoes			1
@entity313 — potassium and sodium triphosphates popular : a few brands use the chemical monosodium glutamate - @entity295 , or @entity295 to enhance the flavour			0
it is particularly popular in @entity302 cuisine these are synthetically produced colourless salts that act as a ‘ stabiliser , buffer and emulsion ’			0
they give a hot dog a firmer texture , keep it at the right acidity and allow the oils and fats to mix with the water			1
@entity313 is also used in detergents as a water softener , and is added to flame retardants , paper , rubber and anti-freeze			0
there are no known health problems from consuming them			1
@entity341 — @entity341 another additive common in food			0
@entity341 is an emulsifier and stabiliser , improving the texture of the hot dog and stopping fat going rancid			2
it also helps prevent food - poisoning bugs			0
in the human body , @entity341 breaks down into phosphate and there is no evidence of a health risk			2
@entity355 — sodium ascorbate a form of vitamin c , sodium ascorbate is an antioxidant and acidity regulator that stops meat losing its red colour and which speeds up the curing process			0
at the low doses in hot dogs , it causes no problems			1
but when taken in large doses as a vitamin pill it can cause skin irritation			0
@entity372 — @entity372 @entity372 is another word for the red food dye cochineal , which has no health effects , as long as you are not allergic to insects			2
for cochineal is made by crushing up the shells of small beetles			0
the shells are boiled in ammonia or sodium carbonate and the colour filtered off			0
the colour , found in supermarket curries , yoghurts , lipstick and pink icing , can trigger allergic reactions and even anaphylactic shock in some people			2
@entity393 — paprika extract another natural food colouring , this time made from the dried pods of @entity398 red chillies			0
it is often added to cheese , orange juice , sauces and sweets			0
and finally ... even if you buy only the finest , most natural hot dogs , you ’re not out of the woods			1
for hot dogs are one of the most dangerous foods you can give to young children			1
in @entity63 , they account for an extraordinary 17 per cent of all child choking cases and kill around 80 children a year			0
they are particularly risky for children under four because they easily get lodged in the airway and are difficult to shift			0
video : do n't watch before eating ! see how hot dogs are really made ...			1

next month sees opening of a @entity44 restaurant specialising in hot dogs and @entity46
cheap hot dogs eaten in excess can be disastrous for a person *'s* health
