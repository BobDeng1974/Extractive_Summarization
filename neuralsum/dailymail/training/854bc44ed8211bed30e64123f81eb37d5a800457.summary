a world where there are no more language barriers might not be too far away - online , at least			1
@entity3 has now released the beta version of its live translation tool , allowing people to speak to others in another language - even if they do n’t know what they ’re saying			1
the tool translates speech instantly , providing both text and spoken translations			1
it lets people of different languages talk to each other on video calls			1
the software translates one language into text and speech of another			1
for now only @entity29 and @entity30 are available - and you need to have a @entity33 8.1 device you can sign up for the beta version of @entity18 now on their website			1
for now the public version is only able to translate between @entity30 and @entity29 - and you need a @entity33 8.1 device to use it			1
but it will eventually have more than 40 languages available letting people of many countries speak to one another with ease			1
there 's no news yet , though , on when the full version will be available			0
‘ @entity3 is now removing another barrier to make it possible for people to communicate irrespective of what language they speak , ’ @entity15 ’s @entity49 wrote in a blog post			1
to start using it , you simply need to choose a contact , turn on the ‘ translation ’ switch for that person , and start typing or speaking if you ’ve made a call			0
the programme analyses speech against audio snippets from millions of previously recorded samples , and transforms the audio into a set of text candidates			2
speech disfluencies - like ‘ ums ’ and ‘ ahs ’ - are removed , and the top choice among the sound - alike words is made , getting the text ready for translation			1
the technology apparently knows how dozens of languages align with one another , by reviewing millions of pieces of previously translated content			0
the translator applies this knowledge to quickly translate text into another language			2
increased usage and user feedback , plus constant refinement by human transcribers , will also help it get better and better			0
@entity18 will eventually support more than 40 languages including - amusingly - @entity91 from the @entity93 universe			1
‘ @entity18 relies on machine learning , which means that the more the technology is used , the smarter it gets			2
’ ‘ we are starting with @entity30 and @entity29 , and as more people use the @entity100 preview with these languages , the quality will continually improve			1
’ the service works by translating your speech as you talk			2
it provides a text version of your speech for the person on the other end of the line , and also reads out what it thinks the translation is			2
to turn it on , you simply need to select the translation setting before making a call to someone			0
initial reports from the beta version say it is good , although not perfect			0
‘ for @entity18 to work properly , there is a little mental conditioning involved , ’ reported @entity121			2
‘ for one , you must speak slowly			0
@entity18 's speech recognition is good , and plenty fast , but that accuracy decreases as you speed up in words per minute			1
‘ " hey , how is it going ? " can change to " hey is going ? " pretty quickly			0
’ it ’s also recommended that the speaker does n’t ‘ um ’ and ‘ ah ’ too much , as this can confuse the translation tool			0
initial reports from the beta version ( shown ) say it is good , although not perfect			0
‘ for @entity18 to work properly , there is a little mental conditioning involved , ’ reported @entity121			2
they say you need to speak slowly , and now ' um ' or ' ah ' too much @entity15 first unveiled the technology two years ago			2
at the time , though , it was deemed too inaccurate to release to the general public			0
but a breakthrough by the @entity3 and @entity15 translator teams in neural network - based speech recognition reduced errors in speech recognition by more than 30 per cent			1
@entity15 says @entity3 has more than 300 million users , while at least 2 billion minutes of conversation are spoken every day			0
@entity3 can be used across a variety of devices including computers , smartphones , tablets and @entity153			0
it allows users to either voice - call or video - call friends and family anywhere in the world without the large costs of regular phone tariffs			0
@entity18 is a spin - off of the technology behind @entity15 's @entity163 clone called @entity164 , the personal voice assistant on @entity166			1
@entity15 first unveiled the technology ( shown ) two years ago			0
at the time , though , it was deemed too inaccurate to release to the general public			0
but a breakthrough by the @entity3 and @entity172 teams in neural network - based speech recognition reduced errors in speech recognition by more than 30 per cent			1

@entity16 - based @entity15 has released a preview of @entity18
it lets people of different languages talk to each other on video calls
the software translates one language into text and speech of another
for now only @entity29 and @entity30 are available - and you need to have a @entity33 8.1 device
but eventually more than 40 languages will be supported - including even @entity91 from @entity93
