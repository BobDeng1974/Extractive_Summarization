by @entity0 published : 21:34 est , 3 november 2012 updated : 14:47 est , 4 november 2012 @entity1 has been accused of resorting to technological trickery in an effort to obscure their ' apology ' to @entity6 after losing the latest round of their ongoing tablet legal battle			1
visitors to the @entity1 @entity12 website homepage have to scroll down to see the statement after an apparent quirk of the new @entity16 code pushes the mea culpa out of sight			1
the re-sized code seems not to affect the @entity21 version of the technology giants website and only appears on the @entity12 one , which has led to users on websites such as @entity26 to smell sour grapes from @entity1			2
visitors to the @entity1 website in the @entity12 could not obviously see the link to read @entity1 's statement regarding @entity6 today according to tech experts , the piece of code that @entity1 used ensures that an advert for the ipad mini takes up the whole page - pushing the apology out of sight			1
one software developer who has spoken to @entity40 , explained that the new @entity16 forces the central image on the website to take up a larger amount of space on the page , showing the new @entity46 , but not a link to the statement			0
this is significant because on october 18 , @entity12 high court judge @entity50 ordered @entity1 to post a message on its @entity12 website for one month stating that @entity6 did not infringe any of @entity1 's patents in the production of their @entity55 and did not break any laws			1
however , @entity6 complained to the @entity12 @entity57 that @entity1 's statement posted on october 25 was inaccurate and it was ultimately deemed to be ' non-compliant ' with the original order made earlier this month			1
it made reference to their victories against @entity6 outside the @entity12 , and as such the original release upset the @entity64 technology company			2
visitors to the website had to scroll down to see a link that would explain the @entity69 technology giants reaction to their legal loss to @entity6 ' a @entity21 jury also found @entity6 guilty of infringing on @entity1 ’s design and utility patents , awarding over one billion @entity21 dollars in damages to @entity1 , ' read the original statement			1
' so while the @entity12 court did not find @entity6 guilty of infringement , other courts have recognized that in the course of creating its @entity83 tablet , @entity6 willfully copied @entity1 ’s far more popular @entity46			2
' furthermore this was placed not on the front page but tucked away accessible only through at least two links and the appeal court demanded that @entity1 change this on thursday and gave them 48 hours to do so			0
the judges , @entity92 , @entity93 and sir @entity94 called the statement ' untrue ' and ' incorrect ' and @entity1 did eventually remove it			0
the difficult to find statement that @entity1 are linking to on the homepage of their website in the @entity12 however , it was only today that technology experts noticed the new ' apology ' and its lack of visibility			2
' on 25 october 2012 , @entity1 published a statement on its @entity12 website in relation to @entity6 ’s @entity83 tablet computers , ' said the new ' hidden ' posting			1
' that statement was inaccurate and did not comply with the order of the @entity57			0
the correct statement is at @entity6 / @entity1 @entity12 judgement			2
' it is unclear whether the re-sized code was a deliberate attempt to conceal their statement or if it is simply because @entity1 are innocently trying fit as many images onto the page as possible			0
but regardless , this is just the latest installment in the spat between the @entity69 and @entity64 companies which began back in 2010			0
the original notice posted on @entity1 's website , which a court said on thursday did not comply with its orders @entity1 have accused @entity6 of copying patents and designs for their respective smartphones and tablets and have opened lawsuits in countries across the world			1
in the @entity12 lawsuit , @entity1 contended that @entity6 had used their @entity136 ' registered design ' for the @entity46 tabler - but judge @entity50 disagreed and found against @entity1 in july			1
@entity6 said that the original statement from @entity1 contained potentially confusing references to @entity140 and @entity21 court decisions as well as the @entity12 ruling , was ' inaccurate and misleading '			2
an @entity46 ( left ) is displayed next to @entity6 's @entity83 tab			0
today @entity1 was told it must post a second statement on its website after a court decided its first version did not comply			0
judges agreed and said @entity1 must post the new statement within the next 48 hours , although the @entity21 company said it would need two weeks to post the notice			0
judge @entity94 told @entity1 's lawyer , @entity153 , he did not believe that it would be difficult to post a new statement on the website			1
' i would like to see the head of @entity1 make an affidavit about why that is such a technical difficulty for the @entity1 company , ' the @entity157 quoted @entity94 as saying			0
' this is @entity1 that can not put something on their own website ? ' @entity1 declined to comment on the ruling until they posted the new statement today .			0

apology message is not displayed unless users scroll down the website
@entity12 judge ruled that @entity6 had not infringed @entity1 's patents
