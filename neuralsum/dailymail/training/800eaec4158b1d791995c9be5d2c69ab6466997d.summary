@entity0 kicked @entity1 to victory in a tense @entity4 match at @entity5			1
the @entity8 international , playing at inside centre this week after starting at full - back against @entity7 last weekend , kicked all the @entity13 side 's points as they came from behind at @entity14 to win 21 - 16 and maintain their perfect start to the @entity17 rugby season			1
the win also ensured that @entity0 's midfield partner @entity19 could celebrate a successful 100th @entity17 game			0
@entity0 scored all of @entity1 's 21 points as they twice came from behind to beat @entity5 in @entity23 @entity24 holds off a tackle as @entity5 pack proved the dominant force during the first half @entity0 ensured @entity1 went into the dressing room at half - time 9 - 7 up , as the @entity32 side enjoyed the better of a fast and furious opening period			1
@entity5 opened the scoring with a classic catch - and - drive move as they threatened a repeat of last season 's fast @entity17 getaway against the same opponents			2
last january 's encounter in the old @entity42 saw @entity5 race into a 14 - 0 lead inside the opening quarter			1
on sunday , the 2013 @entity47 champions were 7 - 0 ahead after six minutes , as first the pack grunted and forced their way through a splintered @entity1 defence to the line , then @entity52 - as injured scrum - half @entity53 watched on from the stands - sent the home fans wild			1
from then , though , the first half belonged to the visitors as they hammered at @entity5 ' defence , in much the same way as @entity60 had at the @entity61 a week earlier			0
@entity62 looks to spread the ball but the @entity5 defence held @entity1 at arms length for most of the game @entity67 wins line out ball for @entity1 ahead of @entity70 as @entity1 continued their good start the difference this week , however , was in the pack			2
returning prop @entity24 brought extra scrummaging might , and where @entity5 had struggled against @entity60 in their opening game , here they were in the ascendancy			0
the home side 's pack were in charge of just about every scrum ; they were in control at the line - outs and they were brutal at the breakdown			0
and when @entity1 's backs did get ball in hand , the @entity5 ' defence held them at arm 's length			2
for all their first - half pressure , @entity1 only had three @entity91 penalties to their name when the referee signalled the end of the first period			1
it could have been four , but the inside centre fired one last effort wide after the hooter had sounded			0
@entity100 carries the ball for @entity5 but the @entity1 defence holds strong at @entity14 @entity103 makes a half break but @entity1 were unable to get over the line despite controlling long periods the second half opened in the same guts - and - glory style as the first			1
@entity52 kicked two early penalties , as @entity5 overturned their first - half deficit			1
he extended their lead after 56 minutes with a third second - half penalty to take the score to 16 - 9			1
@entity24 , who had just returned to the side after playing for @entity116 in the @entity117 , left the pitch to a standing ovation			0
but the intensity could not last			0
as players tired and the game slowed down , both sides began making mistakes			0
and it was @entity1 and @entity0 who benefited most			2
with five minutes remaining , the home side were a single point ahead , and seemed to have the measure of @entity1			0
but they conceded two late penalties , which the ice - cool @entity0 , with jeers and boos ringing around the stadium , converted			2
@entity5 winger @entity135 looks to offload out of the tackle during a tense encounter Ã‚			0

@entity8 star moves from full - back to centre and kicks seven penalties
@entity5 had taken an early lead but @entity1 led 9 - 7 at half time
hosts got back on top at 16 - 9 before @entity0 *stepped* up
