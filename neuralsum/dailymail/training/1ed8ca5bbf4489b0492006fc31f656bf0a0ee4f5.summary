@entity1 boss @entity0 is looking beyond the potential psychological blow his side could land on relegation rivals @entity4 in the @entity5 this weekend			1
the foxes travel to @entity7 on sunday for a fifth - round tie between two sides that are not only struggling in the @entity10 but enduring turbulent times off the field			1
@entity0 has had a dismal week , with his bottom - placed side losing to @entity14 and @entity15 to remain five points adrift of safety			2
but that is only part of a story which has also included a bizarre touchline altercation with @entity14 midfielder @entity22 and seen widespread reports that he had been sacked , only for the club to deny them			0
@entity1 boss @entity0 wants an @entity5 victory over @entity4 to help boost his side 's form @entity1 are currently 20th in the @entity10 table with just just 17 points from 25 games yet , if anything , the turmoil at @entity4 has eclipsed even that at the @entity34 , with fans ' protests culminating in the sacking of manager @entity38 in midweek			1
that could give the foxes the chance to boost their morale and further deflate @entity4 's , but @entity0 is not thinking about the potential impact of victory on the opposition			1
' you could argue that but it is not something that is at the forefront of my thinking , ' he said			0
' my thinking is about our players , getting the team right , getting the performance right and hopefully getting the result we want to get into the next round			2
' when you are not winning in the league , the cup competitions give you an opportunity to win games and hopefully build confidence			2
' i do n't have a great deal of control over what goes on outside of the football club but i will be working very hard to make sure we go into this game as prepared as we can be , bearing in mind the speculation that has surrounded myself , our club and now our opponents			0
' @entity4 parted company with their manager @entity38 after the club dropped into the relegation zone @entity4 lost 2 - 0 to @entity79 last time out and have not won a @entity10 game since december last year @entity4 supporters reveal a ' @entity84 ' banner at the @entity85 on february 10 @entity4 have scored just two goals in their last 10 premier @entity87 and are currently 18th in the table on paper , @entity1 's form is only marginally better than @entity4 's			1
@entity0 's men have lost four of their last five games with the only positive result in that sequence being their fourth - round win over @entity98			1
@entity4 have lost five from six , their fourth - round success against @entity101 the one bright note			1
but while @entity4 's play - and most notably their lack of goals - has been heavily criticised , @entity1 have at least earned some plaudits for their positive attitude			1
@entity0 said : ' anybody who has seen us play recently could not suggest the players lack confidence			0
we have continued to play with a positive intent , and that is always going to be important			0
' we still have enough games for it ( our @entity10 situation ) to be in our hands			0
the players have a responsibility to go out there and perform			0
' @entity120 things have been said about our performances but it is very much a results business			0
this is about us trying to get a positive result in this game			0
that would help us in preparation for the next @entity10 game			0
' @entity1 will have to make at least one change for the tie with on - loan defender @entity132 cup - tied after playing in the third round with @entity134			2
despite their precarious league position , @entity1 have been praised for the attacking football they play on - loan defender @entity132 ( left ) is ineligible for @entity1 after appearing earlier in the @entity5 with @entity134			1

@entity1 face @entity4 in the @entity5 fifth - round on sunday
@entity0 says the *priority* must be a positive performance and result
he wants a strong cup run to help *motivate* @entity1 in the @entity10
@entity4 are also struggling in the league and a @entity5 defeat could deflate them
@entity38 was sacked as @entity4 boss earlier this week
