by @entity0 a football mad father has drawn the line at his wife interrupting his tv viewing of the @entity6 by using his own version of the new vanishing spray given to referees			1
officials have been using the disappearing marker to draw white lines on pitches in @entity14 to stop players encroaching on free kicks			1
father - of - two @entity17 , 39 , was so worried about his wife and daughters interrupting his viewing he has decided to copy the tactic in his living room			1
@entity17 has come up with a novel way of keeping his wife out of the room when he is watching football whenever wife @entity28 , 38 , @entity29 , 18 , or @entity30 , 15 , approach the sofa he sprays a line of shaving room in the doorway from the kitchen to keep them out			1
however , @entity28 and the girls got their own back when they posted a video of @entity17 's special spray on @entity41 and several women accused him of being sexist			1
@entity43 fan @entity17 , an engineer from @entity44 , @entity45 , laughed off the controversy but says his spray is here to stay			2
he said : ' there was lots of hype around this new vanishing spray and so i decided to try it out for myself with shaving foam			1
@entity28 and his daughters got their own back when they posted a video of @entity17 's special spray on @entity41 ' i sprayed a line in the kitchen to stop my wife passing it - she found it hilarious			1
she was in on the joke and if you look at the video you can see her laughing			0
' i plan on using it for future matches outside my living room so people know not to disturb me and i 'm able to watch the footie in peace and quiet			2
' anyone who crosses it will get a red card			0
' the genuine article is named 9:15 @entity75 , a reference to the minimum distance in metres that opposing players should be from the ball after a foul			0
invented by an @entity84 journalist , it 's a mixture of butane , isobutane and propane gas , a foaming agent and water			0
necessary : @entity43 fan @entity17 laughed off the controversy but says his spray is here to stay the invention has never been used at a @entity6 before but it 's nothing new for fans of @entity94 where it 's featured in league matches for years to stop defensive walls creeping forward			2
the vanishing spray will not be introduced into the @entity100 next season despite it being considered a success at the @entity6			0
the new initiative marks out where a free - kick should be taken from and where the defensive wall must stand , aiming to prevent players cheating			0
referee @entity108 sprays a temporary line on the field marking ten yards as players from @entity14 and @entity112 form a wall during the @entity115 match between @entity14 and @entity112 it will be used in the @entity117 from next season			2
but the @entity100 and @entity119 will monitor how effective that is before introducing it			0
