by @entity0 published : 07:45 est , 26 february 2013 updated : 11:08 est , 26 february 2013 laptops , tablets and smartphones have dramatically changed the way we work - and even the way we sit , researchers have claimed			1
a new study has found that most desks , designed for traditional ' desktop ' computers , have meant we have created a range of new ways to sit			0
they range from ' the cocoon ' , where people hunch up on their chair to be close to their phone , to ' the smart lean ' , used to check emails during a meeting			2
the nine new workplace postures : these new ways of sitting and slouching to fit ourselves around new mobile computing technology have been identified by research from office furniture company @entity26 smartphones and tablet computers , small and light enough to be grasped in the hands , have liberated workers from postural slavery to our digital overseers			1
now new research has shown that the change in the ways we deal with technology in the workplace is indeed changing the way that we sit and slouch while we 're earning our keep			0
a survey of 2,000 office workers in 11 countries undertaken by office furniture maker @entity26 has identified nine new postures which have emerged in response to the new technologies we interact with			1
they are : contorting to fit : office workers have hitherto been kept in postural bondage to the immobile machines they interact with to earn their keep the new postures identified were a result of using small , mobile technology such as smartphones , tablets and laptops and new workplace behaviours			1
however , with furniture poorly adapted to these new ways of sitting and slouching , @entity26 notes , they frequently cause pain and long - term injuries , disrupting concentration and creativity			2
@entity69 , vice president of global design for @entity26 , said : ' we love our technology – it ’s become a ubiquitous extension of ourselves			2
' but the way technology impacts our bodies as we work has been largely ignored			0
' based on this research , @entity26 has designed a new chair – gesture – that moves with the body and supports the user throughout the different postures			0
it will be available in the @entity84 later this year .			0

mobile ****device***s* have changed the way that office workers sit at their desks , study shows
office furniture maker @entity26 surveyed more than 2,000 people in countries to identify nine new postures
the draw – technology ( small and mobile ) allows people to pull back from their desks while they use it . they ***recline*** , signaling they ’re contemplating or *absorbing* **information** and draw the ***device*** closer to their body to maintain an *optimal* focal *length* .
the @entity108 - this posture is *representative* of how people adapt to *multi**tasking*** on *multiple* - ****device***s* . one hand holding a phone to the ear , the other **tasking** on a laptop . the result is a **forward** lean that is a *symbol* of concentration and an *orientation* to the smaller ***screen*** of a laptop .
the text - smartphones are small compared to other forms of technology and , therefore , require unique postures . workers bring *arm*s in close as *keying* and gesturing are *performed* .
the @entity132 ***recline*** , bring up their feet onto the seat , and draw their smartphone or tablet close , resting on their thighs . the result is a cocoon - small mobile technology allows people to *remain* *productive* in this posture .
the @entity145 posture results when the ***device*** is used on a work ***surface*** in ' *surfing* mode ' , in which people operate the ***device*** with one hand , **typically** with *swiping* gestures . because it ’s on a work ***surface*** , a **person** must keep their head a certain *distance* above the tablet in order to see it , and position their head to look down at it .
the @entity164 posture is the result of mobile ****device***s* that create the desire for people to *temporarily* ' pull away ' from others without leaving a meeting or *collaborative* *environment* . this is **typically** a *temporary* posture and used for *glancing* at *incoming* texts or e-mails .
the trance - this posture was observed when people were *focused* on the ***screen*** and either *mousing* or using a *touchpad* to *navigate* on the ***screen*** for extended *periods* of time . this is a long duration posture .
the take it in - in this posture , people ***recline*** to view content on the large display and / or sit back to contemplate . this posture is about ' taking in ' **information** rather than *generating* it .
the @entity195 ' *strunch* ' ( *stretched* - out hunch ) is a very common posture with laptops . as people become *fatigued* , they *gradually* push their laptop further from the edge of the work***surface*** , resting their *weight* on the ***surface*** . this causes them to reach **forward** to work . since the back and neck can not sustain the reach and hunch posture for a long time , the **person** *begins* to prop themselves up with their non- **tasking** *arm* .
