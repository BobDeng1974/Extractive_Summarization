by @entity0 she launched an extraordinary attack on the fashion world and hit out at fashion bible @entity4 after the @entity6 edition claimed she fell asleep during an interview , but @entity8 may well be regretting her tirade now			1
the 21 - year - old has been revealed as @entity4 's new cover girl and graces the september issue - the glossy magazine 's most prestigious edition			1
writing about the upcoming issue on its website , @entity4 says : ' the biggest that we have ever published - and with more fashion shoots than ever before - the september issue brings all of the autumn / winter 2014 collections to the fore for the first time , making us almost wish for the first leaf to fall ( or at least start to prepare sartorially for when it does )			1
' described by the magazine as ' fashion 's most talked about girl ' , this is the third time in 18 months that @entity8 has fronted the magazine			1
clearly shot before @entity8 described the fashion industry as ' not the most understanding or compassionate of industries ' , the young supermodel looks flawless posing in a 60s inspired outfit on the cover of the 462 - page issue wearing new - season @entity47			1
a few weeks ago , @entity8 lashed out at the fashion world in a well - documented @entity50 tirade			1
it all stemmed from a piece that @entity6 @entity4 's @entity53 wrote that claimed that the party - loving model was late for their meeting			1
she also said that the 21 - year - old requested a massage prior to their interview and fell asleep , causing the meeting to be cut short			1
hitting back : @entity61 has claimed that @entity8 fell asleep during an interview and the model has hit back on @entity50 branding the fashion bible ' liars ' @entity53 explains that @entity8 was in pain from too much kickboxing and wanted the pair to enjoy a massage before the interview so that they could both be ' relaxed			1
' @entity53 was left waiting half an hour after the massage ended , only to be informed that @entity8 had fallen asleep			1
in her article about the episode , @entity53 writes : ' @entity8 finally appears , looking refreshed after her rest			1
“ i ’m so sorry ! ! ! ” she exclaims , collapsing into a chair			0
“ i fall asleep everywhere ! someone recently asked if they could publish a book of pictures of me sleeping , because there are so many			2
” @entity8 ’s personal assistant then informed @entity53 that @entity8 was n't hanging around or going to @entity90 with her as they had planned and was instead off to do some film recording , followed by hair and make - up , a fitting for her @entity85 ball outfit with @entity86 , a @entity88 - store launch party , all rounded off by dinner with @entity96			1
@entity53 goes on to explain that she then called photographer @entity97 , who has worked with @entity8 many times , only to be told by him that on every shoot he 's done with her , @entity8 's fallen asleep ( even snoozing for seven whole hours on a @entity102 shoot			1
) speaking out : @entity8 took to @entity50 to explain to her 1.7m followers that the fashion industry ' is not the most understanding or compassionate ' of industries @entity53 discovers that @entity8 had been out partying with @entity107 the night before their meeting and later calls @entity8 to ask about her love of a good night out and her resulting reputation			1
' well , the going out is more to do with the fact that i am literally jet - lagged all the time , ' @entity8 told @entity53			1
' i ca n’t sleep in the evenings			0
most of the pictures people see of me are me going to work events : a @entity88 dinner one night , a @entity123 dinner the next , and working all day			2
' actually , compared to anyone else my age that i know , i really go out so little , ' she tells her			0
the article was posted in the early hours of the morning on june 25 and @entity8 was quick to respond			2

what happened to supporting each other ? it ’s even worse when your [ sic ] trying to fight people that have all the power because then you are powerless			0
' all i can say is i work extremely hard and ‘ sleeping ’ is proof that sometimes i work too hard			2
i apologise for being so ambitious			0
this just shows that the fashion industry is not the most understanding or compassionate of industries			2
' that only applies to the people that sit around not really caring and never really bothering to get to know you or what it ’s really like			0
what happened to supporting each other ? '			0
party girl : the @entity4 article alludes to how much @entity8 , pictured here with @entity159 , enjoys a good night out motivational message : @entity8 shared an inspirational quote on her @entity162 after her @entity50 rant about the offending article in little more than two years , @entity8 has reached supermodel status , but in a recent interview she seemed a tad downbeat about her chosen industry			1
while she acknowledges her ‘ luck ’ at having achieved so much in such a short space of time , she told @entity172 of @entity173 that young girls should be aspiring for careers that are more intellectually demanding			0
when asked what she ’d do if her daughter wanted to become a model , she replied : ‘ i ’d say no , if that ’s all she aspired to			0
you know , i get a lot of girls who say , i just want to be a model so badly			0
and i think : you can do better than that			0
‘ i mean , look , i do love it , i ’m not saying anything bad about it , i just think you can do a lot more			0
’ she adds : ‘ i was incredibly lucky to do as well as i ’ve done , it ’s not easy , there ’s so many models go through so much s * * t , and it ’s just , if you have a brain , which everyone does , use it and try and do something else			0
’ success : @entity8 's fortunes have changed drastically over the last two years			2
from comparatively humble beginnings as a fashion intern at @entity201 , she is now one of the world 's most successful , and sought after young models @entity8 ’s ascent began in the offices of fashion website @entity201 in 2012 , where she was ‘ discovered ’ by @entity209 ’s @entity208 while working as an intern			2
‘ as a model , i really stand for not being a model , if that makes sense , ’ she said			0
‘ when i started , the whole idea of the model was very different , it was a bit stuck - up			2
not stuck - up , but no one was trying to have fun , or not even have fun , but be willing to smile			2
’ that smile , allied with a series of comedic expressions , has become something of a trademark - and a magnet for the cameras that follow her every move			0
what 's more , the star admits she would love to quit modelling herself one day and go away and make a music album for six months			0
she said : ' that 's what i 'd f * * king love to do			0
and when this shit does n't work out , yeah , i will block that out and do it			0
