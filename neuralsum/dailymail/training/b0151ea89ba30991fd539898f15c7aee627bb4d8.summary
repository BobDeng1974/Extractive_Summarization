by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor justice minister @entity2 said there is not ' right to be forgotten ' , only a right to request that information be deleted there is no such thing as a right to ‘ be forgotten ’ online , the government insisted today			1
justice minister @entity2 argued that people do not have an ‘ unfettered ’ right to demand the removal of links to internet articles containing information about them			1
it follows a controversial ruling from the @entity19 that search engines like @entity21 have to consider requests to wipe links to news stories			1
mr @entity2 likened the ruling to @entity26 which has been criticised for ' closing down people 's right to information '			1
the purge of search results applies to @entity21 's local search pages covering the @entity34 's 28 member nations and four other @entity36 countries , encompassing more than 500 million people			1
but users in @entity36 who switch to the firm 's @entity40 domain , @entity42 , will find unaltered search results			2
the ' right to be forgotten ' is based on the premise that outdated information about people should be removed from the internet after a certain time			1
but after links to stories started disappearing , @entity21 last week performed a u-turn began reinstating some of them			1
mr @entity2 told members of the @entity55 that to suggest there is a right to be forgotten is not ' accurate or helpful			1
he added : ' clearly in the modern world that we live in there are many challenges about how you balance data protection and freedom			0
‘ in many ways you could say we are at a crossroads and the very fact that this get to the @entity19 shows that			2
' under the present law individuals clearly do have the right to request deletion of their personal data where it is irrelevant , outdated or inappropriate			0
' but it is also clear in the legislation that there will also sometimes be a public interest in retaining the information			0
' there is no right given by the judgement for people to have there personal data deleted from the search engine results			2
there is no unfettered right			2
' there is no right to be forgotten			0
not in the law of the @entity93 , not in directives , not in the judgements of the court			0
' he said it was ' unacceptable ' for people to try to have criminal convictions deleted			0
he added : ‘ we have criticised the government of @entity26 ... for closing down people 's right to information			2
there are other countries with strict information access			0
‘ it is not a good position for the @entity34 to be in to look as if it is countenancing restrictions in the access of the citizen to access to information because it could be a very bad precedent			0
’ earlier this month the @entity118 ’s economics editor @entity117 asked why he was being ' cast into oblivion ' by @entity21 after the @entity118 received an alert saying a 2007 blog about a chief executive leaving investment bank @entity123 would no longer appear in @entity21 searches in @entity36			1
the company was accused of over-zealously tearing down links to webpages following demands from people claiming their so - called ' right to be forgotten '			1
but links to articles which had previously been deleted have now re-appeared on the website after public outcry at what many viewed as unacceptable censorship of the internet			0
@entity21 is thought to have a backlog of more than 250,000 censorship requests to deal with a @entity1 article about a @entity142 referee found to have lied about his reasons for giving a penalty during a top flight football match was among those re-instated			1
the webpage had been among the first removed from @entity21 after the new rules came into force			2
head of communications @entity150 said last week : ' we have to balance a whole range of things - free expression , privacy and the public 's right to know			0
' this is new territory for us all			0
there 's no right of appeal in the @entity19 but we think it 's important to have a public debate about this			0
this is a very , very important issue for the future of privacy , free expression and journalism			0
' @entity21 is thought to have a backlog of more than 250,000 censorship requests to deal with and is deleting links purely because people did not want their comments on news stories to be viewed online			1
mr @entity150 said : ' the @entity19 ruling was not something that we welcomed or wanted , but it is now the law in @entity36 and we are obliged to comply with that law			2

controversial @entity36 court ruling gave people ' right to be forgotten '
@entity21 has since been sent 250,000 demands to remove links to webpages
@entity2 says talk of a right to be forgotten is not ' accurate or helpful '
insists people do not have an ‘ unfettered ’ right to have web links removed
