by @entity1 reporter when retired mathematician @entity3 passed away after a battle with cancer , his grieving family chose an epitaph that he would have heartily approved of – a sudoku puzzle and equation			1
it did not take long , however , before zealous officials on the parish council had formed their own rather bizarre opinion of the gravestone			1
they ordered mr @entity3 ’s widow @entity14 to remove the highly personal engravings because they are ‘ contrary to guidelines for headstone inscriptions ’			1
widow @entity18 is furious that @entity19 , @entity20 , has ordered that the @entity22 puzzle engraving on her husband @entity23 's headstone be removed and despite the tasteful – not to mention cerebral – nature of the designs , the council said the stone has to be changed so that standards at the graveyard are ‘ kept high for the benefit of all ’			1
mrs @entity18 , 67 , who was married to her late husband for 44 years , said : ‘ what really got to me was they said we were lowering standards of the burial site			2
well , that ’s just not true			0
‘ the engravings are n’t offensive at all ; we ’re talking about a three inch square puzzle and a small numerical equation			2
it ’s about honouring my husband ’s memory			0
’ mr @entity3 was a sudoku fanatic , completing puzzles every day , while the equation was taken from his phd thesis , which he dedicated to his wife in the early years of their marriage			2
mrs @entity18 ’s son , @entity52 , 40 , added : ‘ it is a very personal memorial that surely is not causing any harm , regardless of petty rules			0
jobsworth springs to my mind			0
’ @entity59 's family , including son @entity52 and wife @entity14 , pictured together , have been ordered to remove @entity22 engraving commemorating the 66 - year - old , pictured right , who died last year mr @entity3 , who worked for oil giant @entity64 in a research laboratory , died aged 66 in may last year , following a battle with lung cancer			1
he was buried in the cemetery at @entity69 , near @entity70 , where the couple lived , and the gravestone was put up in november			0
but this august mrs @entity18 received a call from the parish council to say a spot check of graves had revealed her husband ’s tombstone did not comply with their guidelines			1
then last month she was sent the letter ordering her to remove the engravings altogether			0
@entity83 , clerk to the parish council , said the stonemason had failed to submit a draft copy of the proposed headstone inscription to the council before it was erected , and asked for it to be changed			1
to add insult to injury , the letter wrongly referred to mr @entity3 as ‘ mr @entity92 ’			2
mrs @entity18 , who has two children and four grandchildren , said there are other graves with unusual engravings , such as animals and football crests			0
‘ until the others are removed as well i ’m going to refuse to change @entity23 ’s grave , ’ she said			0
mr @entity3 added that his family would be prepared to go to court to keep the existing headstone .			1
