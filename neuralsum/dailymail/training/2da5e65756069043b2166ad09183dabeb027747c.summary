by @entity0 published : 12:37 est , 13 november 2012 updated : 14:47 est , 13 november 2012 a widow who gave birth to her husband 's twins through @entity5 after he died is embarking on a legal battle to ensure her children are treated as their father 's heirs			1
@entity10 is taking her fight to the @entity12 after her now 11 - year - old twins were denied survivor benefits because they were not yet alive at the time of their father @entity16 's death			1
the @entity18 in @entity19 , @entity20 , has refused to grant @entity21 and @entity22 the monthly benefits , citing the fact that they did not technically ' survive ' their father			1
' the law has not caught up with the science ' : the @entity12 will decide whether the twins should be treated as their father 's heirs even though they were conceived and born after his death when mr @entity16 first fell ill , he decided to have some sperm frozen so that the chemotherapy treatment he was about to undergo would not prevent him and his wife from having children			2
when he died in 2001 , his wife used the preserved sperm to conceive through @entity5 , and @entity22 and @entity21 were born around 10 months after her husband 's death			2
she believes her son and daughter are entitled to receive survivor benefits - worth a few hundred dollars per month based on mr @entity16 's earnings - but the @entity18 has refused to pay out			2
the @entity12 will hear the case - the first of its kind in the state , and one of only a handful across the @entity20 - on thursday			1
@entity51 , a family law attorney in @entity52 , @entity53 , said : ' a lot of these situations are so new that the law has not caught up with the science			0
@entity12 in @entity58 will hear the case - the first of its kind in the state ' we 're making new law here , and it 's a pretty exciting time if you 're a lawyer , ' she told the @entity64			1
' why should n't these kids get the money ? ' asked mrs @entity10 's attorney @entity67 , who pointed out that the twins ' 14 - year - old sister @entity68 - who was also conceived through @entity5 , but before her father 's death - is receiving the benefits			1
some @entity20 states allow for inheritance to be awarded to children conceived posthumously , but @entity19 is not one of them			0
state law says that for children to inherit they must ' survive the decedent '			0
' thus , the individual is required to be alive at the time of the decedent 's death , ' attorneys for the @entity18 state in court papers			0
before he died , @entity16 left a power of attorney authorizing his wife to take ' any and all action necessary pertaining to any sperm or embryos i may have stored , including their implantation or termination '			0
mr @entity67 argues conception should n't be defined solely by the moment when sperm meets egg , but is instead ' a process '			0
in the case of the @entity103 , that process spanned many months and @entity16 was alive for much of it , even injecting his wife with hormones to assist the process the night before he died , the lawyer has said			0
but the @entity18 insists ' there is no basis for this interpretation of " conception " in the state ... statutes ' .			2

@entity10 , of @entity19 , @entity20 , conceived twins through @entity5 using the frozen sperm of her late husband
the twins have been denied state survivor benefits because they were not yet alive when their father died
the @entity18 insists @entity22 and @entity122 therefore did not ' survive ' their father
the @entity12 will hear the case - the first of its kind in the state - this week
