by @entity0 in @entity1 by @entity2 @entity1			1
two syllables which still pack a little shimmer of magic			0
it was a hill apart – @entity8 – where life felt different from in the rest of @entity11			0
here most of the famous names of modern art from @entity14 downwards had at some time lived and gone hungry			1
@entity2 knows every inch of @entity1 then and now			1
starting in 1900 she follows its inhabitants ’ adventures and hardships , triumphs and disasters , from street to street and bar to bar till she reaches 1910			1
a little shimmer of magic : most of the famous names of modern art have at some time lived in @entity1 her narrative is like watching a newsreel of clips of old footage , some of which you ’ll have seen before but never assembled in one continuous loop to scroll down			1
many books of art history get boring because they proceed endlessly from picture to picture or get tangled in knots of theory			1
this book skates lightly over such matters as @entity47 , saying what usefully can be said in words and no more			0
the key pictures are given their due , though they are shockingly under - illustrated			1
all the time the caravan moves on diverting us with the rows , the love affairs , the rivalries , the fights , the parties , the drunken bouts			1
if you do n’t know it all already this is a reliable , entertaining guide to a period when artists discovered new ways of seeing and of expressing themselves			0
the fascinating thought is that they were still unknown and unappreciated			0
they could hardly sell their pictures for a few hundred francs , which today would command millions of dollars if they were n’t already in museums			0
dominating the scene and the period were @entity75 and @entity14 with their respective ‘ bondes ’ — or gangs — of followers			1
during this decade @entity75 was by far the most successful and well - known of the two			1
leader of the modernists : @entity14 's work now sells for millions he was 30 when he arrived in @entity1 with a wife , @entity83 , and already had two children			1
@entity83 devoted herself to his career and kept them solvent by modelling hats in a shop			0
with his solid beard and moustache , his round spectacles and the frock - coat she made him wear , @entity75 looked the essence of reliability			1
he was nicknamed by the other artists ‘ @entity96 ’ though his nature was more daring than most others ’			2
the two big art shows of the year were the @entity100 and the @entity101			2
@entity75 electrified them in 1904 by showing ‘ @entity112 ’ in a huge floral hat with a stripe of pale green paint running down the centre of her face to the end of her nose			2
this uninhibited use of colour applied to landscapes and interiors , where such colour did not occur in real life , shocked the public and the critics			0
one reacted by calling @entity75 and his followers ‘ @entity123 ’ — the @entity124			2
their canvases were too shocking to sell except to a few patrons			0
nobody would have nicknamed @entity130 ’			2
he was 19 when he paid his first visit from @entity132 , a slight , small , uncertain - looking youth with a blob of already receding dark hair			1
he hardly spoke because he knew no @entity136			0
all that was recognisable from our familiar images of him were his black voracious pools of eyes			0
when he came back to @entity1 in 1904 he found @entity143 , a tall , redheaded model			2
he spent nearly a year persuading her to leave the sculptor she lived with to share his studio			0
she found a place of unutterable squalor with barely any furniture and every surface crusted with dirt and squashed paint tubes			2
there was a white mouse who lived in a drawer			1
@entity157 squalor : one of @entity14 's muses once found a white mouse who lived in a drawer once he had got her , @entity14 would not let her model for other painters			1
he had seduced too many models himself to risk it so @entity143 devoted herself to a life of leisure , reading novels and demanding perfume and chocolates whenever he made a sale			0
@entity14 waited on her like a dog			1
they were often caricatured as a couple because she towered above him			0
she also dominated him as his @entity176 for the seven years they were together			2
once , during a row , she shook him until his buttons fell off			0
but it was mainly a peaceful partnership ; the opium they smoked saw to that			0
@entity2 loves describing low - life in lip - smacking detail and she has a great cast to bring on — characters like the wild bacchanalian artist @entity189 , the child - like visionary @entity190 and the beady - eyed writer @entity192 , who claimed that she sat for @entity14 90 times for her formidable portrait			1
the author claims too much for @entity1 ’s role in the artistic revolutions of the time			2
by 1910 its artistic importance was over			0
@entity14 and @entity143 were rich enough to move to the @entity201 and employ a maid			1
and the artistic centre had crossed the @entity204 to @entity205 .			0

most of the famous names of modern art from @entity14 downwards have at some time live in *montmarte*
starting in 1900 , @entity2 follows its inhabitants ’ adventures and hardships , triumphs and disasters , from street to street and bar to bar
@entity14 was 19 when he paid his first visit from @entity132
there , in his squalid *bachelor* *pad* , he painted one muse for seven years - even after she found a white mouse in his drawer
