@entity0 has begun talks with a @entity3 regulator to make ejectable flight recorders available on its two largest models			1
the announcement means the company 's @entity7 and new @entity10 aircraft could be the first commercial planes to use such technology			1
the @entity3 company also hinted that in the future , it could expand the use of these ejectable recorders , which combine voice and data recordings , even further - to new versions of its @entity21 and @entity22 jets			1
@entity0 has begun talks with a @entity3 regulator to install ejectable flight recorders on its two largest models			1
pictured : @entity7 the talks with the @entity25 ( @entity25 ) comes in the wake of the december 28th @entity28 tragedy , where the data recorded was recovered but the voice recorder is still missing			1
an ejectable recorder would make it easier to recover evidence in such cases			2
already used in military planes , ejectable or ' deployable ' recorders separate from the tail during a crash and float , emitting a satellite distress signal			2
' @entity0 is working with @entity25 and other stakeholders to advance the approval of such a solution industrywide , ' a spokesman for @entity0 said , adding that there was no indication when the devices might come into use			0
' in the future , applicability for our other aircraft products could likewise be considered , but presently , we have decided to focus on the @entity10 and the @entity7			2
' @entity25 declined to comment			0
the talks with the @entity25 come in the wake of december 's @entity28 tragedy though the data recorder was recovered from the @entity28 flight , the voice recorder is still missing after being recommended by investigators following the @entity61 a330 jet crashed in 2009 , ejectable recorders have recently been gaining support at the @entity64 ' @entity63 ( @entity63 )			1
a proposal recommending that new commercial aircraft certified after 2016 be equipped with them is to be heard by @entity63 's @entity68 this month			0
if approved , following a three - month consultation among 191 member states , it would likely appear in a new package of @entity63 standards in 2016 , possibly coming into effect from around 2021			0
that said , @entity63 's standards are not always implemented by all member nations			0
@entity78 recorders are already popular in military aircraft as they emit a satellite distress signal in a crash @entity0 also hopes to add ejectable , or deployable , recorders to their largest a350 models ( pictured ) such an initiative could also benefit existing military suppliers including @entity87 's @entity86 , which is pushing for ejectable black boxes in commercial aircraft			2
however , not all countries appear ready to back the technology , which is seen as only one way of recovering evidence on crashes over water			0
others include rolling out lower - frequency locator beacons , under an already approved @entity63 standard , that would make black boxes easier to find			0
some officials fear that relying solely on ejectable flight recorders would take attention and resources away from the search for deep - water wreckage and bodies that can also help solve air crashes and ease the suffering of families			1
@entity110 has taken the opposite stance over the use of deployable recorders , arguing that the majority of its black boxes are recovered within 30 days , also citing instances where these alternative recorders have failed on military aircraft .			0
