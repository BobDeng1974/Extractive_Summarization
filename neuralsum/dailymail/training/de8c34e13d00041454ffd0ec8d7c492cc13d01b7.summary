they show three men approaching and harassing the mammals as they try to rest at the ' @entity9 ' in @entity10 - in two separate incidents			1

the incident , captured on webcam , follows an earlier attack on the mammals by two women video : two men are seen harassing seals in a separate incident captured on film			1
the beach is closed to the public at night the attacks have been captured on round - the - clock ' @entity44 ' was set up at the @entity9 in @entity10 to capture the dozens of seals on film			1
but rather than just attracting nature enthusiasts it also attracted the police after the vicious attack on the mammals by two young women was caught on film			1
the women were filmed sitting on the seals , pulling their flippers and kicking them during the incident on january 24 before the animals rush into the water to escape the abuse			1
one of the pair takes photographs as the other continues to hurt the animals			0
activists say rather than a rare event - the abuse of seals is commonplace			1
though no similar evidence exists of violence , videos captured by the @entity74 group show families closely approaching and scaring the animals , children kicking sand at the creatures and divers them and causing visible distress			2
shocking : the footage of the two abusers horrified the @entity10 community and has caused a night time ban on people accessing the @entity9 area many @entity10 locals are unhappy about restricted access to certain parts of the beach by mayor @entity93 abuse of the seals appears to have become a common feature at the beach			1
@entity44 observer @entity98 wrote : ' we had our first pup born today and it was something special			1
this evening mother took it for a short swim			0
earlier today the pup tried to figure out what a sea gull was			2
unfortunately , this afternoon someone threw sand into the pups eyes			0
' nasty verbal altercations have taken place near the spot between the seal activists who want people barred from going on the beach and those that support mixed use			0
mayor @entity93 introduced new rules banning people from going onto the beach between sunset and sunrise until the end of the pupping season in may			0
' i felt it was important to take this step after evidence of individuals seen on video tape , harassing , taunting and causing stress to the seals at the @entity9 in @entity10 , ' he said in a statement			1
' the behavior was shocking , reprehensible and certainly not a reflection of how most citizens in our fine city believe animals should be treated			0
' a rope is currently up at the beach to stop visitors getting too close during the birthing season and a park ranger and police patrols have also been introduced to ensure visitors respect the animals			0
however , many closely approach the creatures regardless to get holiday snaps and many divers swim onto the beach alarming seals and causing them to rush into the water			2
pupping season : a @entity158 mother is seen attending to her new born at the @entity9 , @entity10			1
various cases of disruption of the animals have been reported resting : harbor seals are supposed to be protected on the beach , but many people ignore the rope and signs disruptive : there is an ongoing debate in the local area over whether the beach can be used by both humans and seals the two rival camps have long been at war over the beach with many saying activists put off visitors who just want to respectfully observe the animals at a beach originally designated for children 's use			1
however , the shocking abuse in january appears to have bolstered support for measures to further support the animals			0
@entity187 of the @entity188 which oversees the web - cam told @entity190 : ' i think the beach closure is absolutely necessary and a step in the right direction			2
' we are very thankful to mayor @entity93 who appreciates the seals and wants to provide meaningful protection for them			2
unfortunately , the incident seen of the two women harassing the seals is only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the harassment of seals on this beach			1
' @entity209 , a lawyer who represents the @entity210 , told @entity211 : ' it 's great that the new mayor is being proactive and at least closing the seal rookery at night , when the seals are without any protection , and the rope is not really visible			2
' ' this is important for public safety and for protection of the resting marine mammals during their pupping season			0
' there have been no arrests following the case in january			0
