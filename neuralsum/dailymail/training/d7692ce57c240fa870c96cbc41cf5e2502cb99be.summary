the supermarket has created the three wines to provide customers with authentic pairings for their favourite @entity11 curries			1

@entity3 have created three unique wines especially designed to compliment the spices of the nation 's favourite curries @entity18 said that she was looking for a wine that would n't be overpowered by deep @entity11 flavours			1
' my goal was to bring wines to the @entity29 that can pair authentically with @entity11 food			1
it 's tricky to craft a wine that can stand up to such a wealth of spices and flavours , so @entity19 and i aimed to blend fruit forward , fresh wines with great varietal expression			2
