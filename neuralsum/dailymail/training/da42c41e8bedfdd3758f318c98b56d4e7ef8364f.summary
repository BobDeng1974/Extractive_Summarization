@entity0 has given up on the idea of stopping @entity2 from taking charge of the @entity4 if he is ousted as leader after the election			1
the deputy prime minister and his supporters had hoped that a leading contender on the right of the party like @entity12 could mount a challenge			1
but allies of mr @entity0 have told @entity15 that left - winger mr @entity2 is ' unstoppable ' , and could mount a challenge even if the @entity4 are returned to government in a new coalition			1
mr @entity0 has vowed to lead his party into the election , and will refuse to step down if he gets the @entity4 back into government , regardless of how few of his mps survive			2
party sources suggest he could even cling on for several months if the @entity35 or @entity36 can take power without the @entity4 for a ' transitional period '			0
but hopes of a @entity4 minister mounting a challenge against mr @entity2 are fading fast			1
' @entity2 is unstoppable now , ' said one senior @entity4 source			1
' he is a relentless campaigning politician			0
' he replies to every tweet , he speaks to every councillor , he turns up to every dinner			1
he 's got the time because he has never had to run a department			0
' mr @entity2 , pictured hugging mr @entity0 in 2012 , is seen to have spent the last five years build support amongst the party 's 40,000 members while others have been ' tarnished ' while serving as ministers in the coalition mr @entity2 has previously been dismissed by some in his party as a ' cheeky chappie telling jokes about @entity56 and the miners '			1
but he is understood to have built huge grassroots support , unencumbered by taking difficult decisions in coalition			2
supporters of mr @entity0 insist that if he gets the @entity4 back into a coalition after the election , his position is safe			0
' he will be able to go on and on , ' said on mp			0
' but that does n't mean @entity2 wo n't try to find a way to position himself as a leader in the wings			1
' mr @entity0 had hoped that his close friend mr @entity12 would have been able to succeed him as leader , to prove the party was serious about being a force in government			1
allies saw mr @entity12 as the standard - bearer of the ' responsible ' wing of the party			1
mr @entity12 , the chief secretary to the treasury , has been considered to be ' on manoeuvres ' for the last 12 months , raising his personal profile and distancing himself from @entity35 @entity82			1
but he has a huge struggle to cling on to his own seat in the @entity86 highlands , and has been tarnished in the eyes of many @entity4 activists by his close association with @entity35 austerity			0
allies of mr @entity0 had pinned their hopes on his close friend @entity12 as the standard - bearer of the ' responsible ' wing of the party energy secretary @entity95 has already thrown his hat into the ring , declaring his willingness to lead the party if it ' falls ' to him			1
he said it was ' not unreasonable ' that he and others wold launch a challenge ' when @entity0 hangs up his clogs as leader '			0
he added : ' if one day it falls to me to lead it , then obviously , i 'd like to do that			0
' but he faces a strong challenge from the @entity35 in his seat , and has failed to impress some of his colleagues			0
' if @entity95 did n't exist as a politician , no - one would invent him , ' said one @entity4 mp			2
health minister @entity113 is also being urged by colleagues to prepare a leadership bid , but he and his wife are reluctant to embrace the degree of exposure the job would involve			1
if mr @entity0 is forced out , there is some doubt about who will be in charge in his absence			0
sir @entity126 , the party 's deputy leader , is standing down at the election so would not be in the @entity129			2
@entity130 , who was caretaker leader before mr @entity0 took over , was once tipped as a successor			2
health minister @entity113 is being urged to prepare a leadership bid , while energy secretary @entity95 has said he would be interested in the job when @entity0 ' hangs up his clogs ' but his leadership chances suffered a fatal blow when his old friend @entity137 carried out polling designed to undermine mr @entity0			1
mr @entity130 denies having any knowledge of the plot , and friends say he has not spoken to @entity137 since			2
in a fresh setback , mr @entity0 sacked mr @entity130 as the party 's economic spokesman for the election campaign , handing the high profile role to mr @entity12			2
it means he will debate with mr @entity82 and @entity36 's @entity148 , with mr @entity130 on the sidelines			0
mr @entity0 has refused to speculate on his future after the election , but insisted he had survived a barrage ofcriticism from all sides since entering coalition in may			0
earlier this month he told @entity157 's @entity156 show : ' look i 've tried to deal , with as much good grace as i can muster , all the criticism i get day in / day out , left , right and centre			0
' it is unsurprising - if it was n't me , whoever would be leader of the party - that you get that kind of incoming flack because what we 're doing is deeply unsettling to the vested interests on right and left in @entity174 politics			0

deputy *pm* has given up hope of an *alternative* successor , say friends
@entity2 has not been a minister but spent five years cultivating grassroots
' replies to every tweet , speaks to every council , turns up to every dinner '
@entity12 , @entity95 and @entity113 also in the running
