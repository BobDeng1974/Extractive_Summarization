their 11 - game winning streak may have come to an abrupt end after saturday 's horror show against @entity4 , but @entity6 's @entity5 and @entity7 were still out and about the following night			1
amidst renewed talks of crisis at the @entity13 after @entity10 's goal sent the @entity15 title challengers crashing to their first home defeat since november 1 , the pair were spotted outside the @entity6 at around midnight on sunday			2
@entity5 and @entity7 caught up with @entity18 midfielder and former @entity13 team - mate @entity19 outside the @entity6 setting that houses poker tournaments , roulette and blackjack tables and serves a range of gastronomic delights in its numerous restaurants			1
@entity7 ( left ) and @entity19 in conversation outside the @entity28 on sunday night @entity7 ( centre ) and @entity19 ( left ) were joined by @entity6 superstar @entity5 ( second right ) @entity19 ' wife @entity31 posted this picture on @entity35 wife @entity5 's wife @entity33 @entity5 catches up with former team - mate @entity19 but the weekend was n't all fun and games for @entity6 the @entity28 with its beach - side location is a popular spot for stars and tourists alike the @entity6 forward arrives at @entity44 ahead of their @entity46 clash with @entity47 the squad arrived at 12.20pm @entity50 time , 13 hours after @entity5 was spotted outside the @entity6 casino a shades - wearing @entity52 arrives alongside his @entity6 team - mates in front of awaiting supporters @entity58 's hands were full upon arrival and he will be hoping to give @entity47 the same problem defender @entity61 signed autographs and posed for pictures with @entity6 supporters and while the boys from @entity6 were out together , @entity19 ' wife @entity31 posted a picture of herself enjoying a night in with @entity5 's other half @entity33 ' back home ' in @entity6			1
returning to his hometown to meet his former colleagues at the beach venue , @entity18 midfielder @entity19 will have brought his own tales of woe to distract his pals from their state of sorrow			0
with his team on the end of some debatable refereeing decisions during their ill - tempered 1 - 1 draw against @entity81 the previous day - just ask @entity82 will be looking ahead to sunday 's @entity83 final clash with @entity86 rivals @entity85 , hoping that fortune will favour his side at @entity89			2
@entity5 and @entity7 will no doubt be wishing their luck will also change after saturday 's loss as the @entity94 ' disappointing show meant they missed out on the opportunity to leapfrog arch rivals @entity96 at the top of the @entity15 table , and a win for @entity101 's side the following day opened up a four - point gap			1
both players were subject to some criticism during the defeat , with @entity5 's performance at the @entity13 , despite showing flickers of brightness , described as ' fretful ' by @entity110 's @entity109			0
two goals would have drawn him level with old foe @entity112 in the race for the ' @entity115 ' ( top scorer ) trophy			0
instead , his fruitless afternoon saw him fall further behind the @entity118 after his strike on sunday capped a 2 - 0 win for @entity96 at @entity121			0
@entity122 @entity7 buries his head in the netting as @entity6 lost their first match in 12 games against @entity4 @entity6 forward @entity5 could not inspire them to win against @entity4 on saturday in @entity15 @entity7 argues with the referee @entity127 before being booked in saturday 's @entity15 loss @entity7 , too , was collared for remonstrating a foul and received his fifth yellow card in @entity15 this season to ensure he 'll miss next weekend 's away game against @entity133			1
so it 's no surprise , then , that the trio were keen to let off some steam , but with @entity140 's men heading into a tough fixture against a rampant @entity47 side and whisperings of an end to @entity6 's hegemony in @entity147 football , it is vital his players get their heads down			1
against @entity4 they showed a distinct lack of inventiveness despite flaunting a front three of @entity5 , @entity52 and @entity58 , who appeared to fade into anonymity again behind his stellar strike partners			0
arriving at @entity44 a mere 13 hours after their visit to the casino , it will be straight back to work for @entity160 as his side become increasingly dependent on him in times of self - doubt			0
one thing we can be sure of is that @entity167 and his men will be smelling blood heading into tuesday night and the 27 - year - old will have to be at his very best if @entity6 are to take home some faith			0
while @entity6 were struggling , @entity47 were handing out a pasting to @entity175 in the @entity176 last season city were knocked out by @entity6 in the @entity46 but will it be the same this time ? @entity122			2

@entity6 duo @entity5 and @entity7 were *photographed* outside the @entity28 at around midnight on sunday
