@entity2 's @entity1 is already seeing the effects of climate change - and may have to abandon some of its launchpads within a decade , it has been claimed			1
researchers who have been studying @entity9 's dunes and beach since 2009 , say the impacts became most apparent after @entity12			1
they found dunes that protected the launchpads were levelled , fences left teetering and a railroad track regularly topped by waves			1
now , the area has been revealed to be at risk from climate change			1
@entity29 , director of center operations for @entity1 , said @entity2 is taking the situation seriously and has plans for dealing with it			1
the @entity1 ( @entity1 ) was originally built for the @entity34 , the largest and most powerful operational launch vehicle in history , for the @entity37 manned moon landing program proposed by president @entity39			1
it has been used to launch every @entity2 human space flight , including @entity43 ( 1973 ) , the @entity40 ( 1974 ) , and the @entity41 ( 1981 - 2011 )			1
@entity1 also has a facility which was used for landing the reusable @entity46 orbiters when weather permitted			2
they say the problem is so bad it could soon affect operations at the centre which has seen launches of everything from the shuttle to @entity2 's @entity20 rocket just last week			1
scientists at the @entity57 geologists say the problem has been ignored until now			2
' we were a little blind to it , like @entity62 , ' said one of the researchers , assistant @entity63 of the @entity66 department			2
' now that we 've seen it , we 're sensitive to it			2
' @entity63 and associate professor of geology @entity69 , who have been studying @entity9 's dunes and beach since 2009 , say the impacts became most apparent after @entity12			1
' @entity12 got a lot of press up north , but it really did a tremendous amount of damage at @entity9 , ' @entity69 said			1
' areas that had previously been relatively stable for decades … suddenly they were gone			0
' @entity63 said a combination of climate change - related sea - level rise and increased wave energy is almost certainly to blame			0
' certainly it 's occurring now , ' he said			0
' is it affecting @entity2 infrastructure ? the answer is yes			0
' @entity29 , director of center operations for @entity1 , said @entity2 is taking the situation seriously and has plans for dealing with it			1
a similar plan has been prepared for @entity2 's @entity93 in @entity94 , though @entity95 has not yet seen the effects that have shown up at @entity39			0
dunes that historically protected @entity1 from high seas even during the worst storms were leveled during @entity100 in 2008 , @entity101 in 2011 and @entity12 in 2012			1
' we do consider sea level rise and climate change to be urgent , ' she said			0
the research came about after @entity2 partnered with the @entity106 and @entity57 to figure out why chronic erosion was happening along a roughly 6 - mile stretch of beach between launch pads @entity111 and @entity112 – the ones used for @entity46 and @entity37 missions			2
the problem had been occurring for years but seemed to be growing worse , beginning with the spate of hurricanes that struck @entity23 in 2004			0
@entity69 said he , @entity63 and doctoral students @entity118 and @entity120 determined the cause was a gap in a near - shore sandbar that funnels the sea toward that section of beach			0
faced with the question of what was causing the increased vulnerability in that part of the shoreline , they soon came to the conclusion that the culprits were sea - level rise and wave climate change			0
dunes that historically protected @entity1 from high seas even during the worst storms were leveled during @entity100 in 2008 , @entity101 in 2011 and @entity12 in 2012			1
a stretch of beachfront railroad track built by @entity2 in the early 1960s that runs parallel to the shoreline has been topped by waves repeatedly during recent storms			1
though idle now – one vulnerable section has even been removed to make room for protective manmade dunes the track serves as a useful yardstick for the @entity154 ’s growing incursions			0
one 2010 @entity2 report predicts it will be permanently breached by 2016			0
after @entity12 , one washed - out section of shoreline was so close to a launch pad at adjacent @entity9 that a fence surrounding the pad was left teetering and near collapse as for what could be at risk next , the first item on the list is a two - lane road the runs parallel to and slightly inland from the railroad track			1
buried beneath it are electrical power lines and pipelines used to transport liquefied gasses			0
in the short term , @entity2 has built new dunes to replace the natural ones that were lost on the threatened section of shoreline			0
visitors on tour buses can look out over one of the new dunes from an elevated mound on the beach			0
' without that secondary dune line , we could have saltwater intrusion at the launch pad , ' @entity29 said			2
looking further into the future , the agency is taking an approach it calls ' managed retreat			0
' that means if sea - level rise becomes insurmountable , @entity29 said , it may eventually have to move roads , utilities and perhaps even launch pads – a costly and complex possibility			2
' when you put immovable infrastructure right next to a dynamic environment , ' @entity69 said , ' something has to give			0

major damage to area was seen after @entity12 hit
launchpad fences close to collapse and railroad tracks topped by waves
rising seas could affect operations with a decade at the launch site
