forget computer testing and expert examinations - the foolproof way is to let a hamster ' drive ' the 16.5 ton monster			0
introducing @entity13 , who , while being guided by a carrot in a circular cage placed on the steering wheel , managed to drive the @entity17 along a dangerous quarry edge in @entity19 in northwestern @entity20			1
to those assembled on the rocky terrain , they are introduced to the project by @entity1 technician @entity43 by being told they will witness the ' ultimate test of a steering system '			0
fingers crossed : it 's fair to say the co-driver was a tad worried dangerous : one wrong move and the truck could well career off the edge turn : it was n't just a straight road the hamster had to navigate ... as if the crowd needed telling , the test area is described as ' beautiful but very , very dangerous			2
' with a puff of his cheeks , which is more than likely mirrored by the those who view the video , @entity60 begins the journey			0
there are a few jerky moments , not least when the truck crashes into a rock by the side of the quarry which crashes into the water below			2
but little @entity13 holds his nerve , and with his desperation to catch the carrot , leads the truck over the finish line to everyone 's relief			1
crash : the team are left open - mouthed when the truck clips a boulder ... ... but thankfully it 's just the boulder that topples over and hits the water phew ! the steering passes the hamster test as the truck reaches the finish line			1

@entity13 , guided by a carrot , drives a *van* along a *perilous* , rocky route
nervy moment as truck careers into boulder that is *knocked* into water below
but @entity13 completes the job - much to his co-driver 's relief
