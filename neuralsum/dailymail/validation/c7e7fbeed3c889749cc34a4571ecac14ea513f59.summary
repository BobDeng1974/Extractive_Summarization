@entity0 has worn the air of a man intent on peaking at the right time this week			1
he has played well , racking up five birdies in succession at one point during his second round at the @entity8 , the first time he has accomplished that on the @entity11 , but there has still been a sense of a man playing within himself			0
everything is about the build - up to @entity17 where the @entity18 begins in a little over a fortnight ’s time			1
it is there that @entity0 will attempt to join a select group of the greats of the game by winning the only major that has eluded him			2
@entity27 would lift him into the company of @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 , and @entity33 who all won the masters , the @entity35 , @entity36 and the @entity37 @entity11 at least once in their careers			0
@entity40 has been tuning up for the masters this week at the @entity8 this week 's @entity8 at @entity42 is @entity0 's last competitive action before @entity17 the masters is the one major that @entity40 is yet to get his hands on having won the other three despite his uneven form in the last month , @entity0 , 25 , has looked and sounded like a man who is exactly where he wants to be in the run - up to the tournament where victory eluded him three years ago when he collapsed on the back nine of his final round			1
if he gets into the same position this year , it is safe to bet he will not let it slip			0
it was important to him to play here at @entity42 , partly to honour @entity59 , who has seemed hurt in recent years when @entity0 decided to skip the tournament			1
but @entity0 also wanted to replicate his routine from 2011 when he had a fortnight off before the masters			2
‘ it worked pretty well at @entity17 , at least for 63 holes , ’ he said .			0

@entity0 five shots behind leader @entity67 at @entity42

@entity72 says @entity0 must be favourite for the @entity18 next month
first time in eight rounds this year that @entity0 broke *70* in @entity75
