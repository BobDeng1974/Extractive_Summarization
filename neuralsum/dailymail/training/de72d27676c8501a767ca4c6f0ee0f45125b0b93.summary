by @entity0 divers in @entity2 have captured rare images of the @entity4 , or pyrosome , sea creature off the coast of @entity7			1
it is so rare it has been dubbed the ' @entity9 ' and can grow up to 30 metres long - the equivalent of two double - decker buses laid end - to - end			2
its hollow , translucent , cylindrical body is made up of thousands of tiny clones called zooids that pull water through its tubes and feed on plankton before pushing the filtered water back out			1
divers from the @entity22 in @entity2 , including @entity23 , have captured rare images of the @entity4 sea creature , pictured , that can reach 30 metres in length			1
its translucent cylindrical body is made up of thousands of tiny filter - feeding creatures called zooids the zooids are each connected by tissue and move as one inside the pyrosome 's tube structure and each zooid is a few millimetres in size			1
also called a sea squirt , the pyrosomes are classed as pelagic , which means they are free - swimming and live in open water rather than near land			1
this means they are rarely spotted and only diving groups are likely to catch a glimpse of the giant creatures			1
the long tube consists of a pointed end with a hole on the other that can be as wide as two metres			0
each pyrosome feasts on plankton and according to @entity55 from @entity56 , it is a cross between the @entity57 in ‘ @entity58 ’ and a clone in ‘ @entity60			2
’ @entity55 said : ' they ’re giant , terrifying looking , and trolling through the depths of the ocean , waiting for you to swim in one end and get stuck			0
but fortunately , in addition to being slow moving filter feeders , they ’re also delicate and fluffy			0
' the pyrosome is so delicate one diver is said to have even described it like a feather boa			0
the zooids , pictured , are each connected by tissue and move as one inside the pyrosome 's tube structure			2
they pull water through the hole at the end of the pyrosome and feed on plankton before pushing the filtered water back out @entity85 usually live in the upper layers of the open ocean in warm seas , although some are found a bit deeper			1
pyrosomes are cylindrical - shaped colonies made up of thousands of individuals , known as zooids			1
colonies can be less than one centimetre up to several metres in length			0
each zooid is a few millimetres in size and are each connected by tissue and move as one inside the pyrosome 's tube structure			0
pyrosomes are classed as planktonic			0
this means their movements are mainly controlled by currents , tides and waves in the oceans			0
@entity23 from from @entity22 recorded the footage of the giant creature off the @entity114 in @entity7 , @entity2			1
he said it was one of the few areas in the world where a wide range of ' oceanic gelatinous plankton ' comes close to shore			2
@entity23 also managed to film salps that are similar to pyrosomes but the individuals inside it are much larger than the zooids inside the pyrosome			2
according to @entity22 's @entity131 page : ' @entity129 have much larger individuals than pyrosomes , individuals pump water through themselves			1
' colonies are formed of chains of individuals			0
@entity129 can form very high densities under good conditions , and are an important oceanic food source for fish			0

deep sea divers have captured images of the *elusive* @entity4 in open water off the coast of @entity7
its hollow , cylindrical body is made up of thousands of tiny creatures called zooids that feed on plankton
also known as the sea squirt , they are *incredibly* rare and only rarely spotted by diving groups
