the notorious currency speculator - whose actions devastated sterling in 1992 - said that @entity4 had the best of all worlds by being part of the @entity6 but not the euro			1
but underlining corporate concerns about the economic impact of a @entity4 exit , he suggested yesterday that an exit would cost jobs and investment			2
@entity2 speaking in @entity22 yesterday : the billionaire investor warned that multinational companies would flee @entity4 , shedding jobs , if the country were to leave the @entity6 ' i leave it to the @entity4 business community , particularly multinationals that set up factories here as an entry point into the common market , to explain to the public what they stand to lose , ' he said			1
' but in one word - jobs			2
' mr @entity2 's comments came as @entity39 leader @entity38 said his party would be unlikely to table an in / out referendum on @entity43 if it was to win the next election			1
@entity45 , the prime minister , is all but committed to such a poll in 2017 after pressure from the @entity49 ' eurosceptic right , who fear an electoral challenge from @entity52 , who are avowedly anti-eu			0
mr @entity2 , who spoke yesterday in @entity22 to promote his latest book , warned that @entity43 's union might yet collapse if its economy continues to stagnate , a situation he blamed on @entity57			1
' the policy of austerity that @entity57 imposed on the eurozone countries was the wrong one , ' he added in a comment piece published this morning in the @entity63			1
' the downward pressure has now diminished and this has given financial markets a lift			0
but the prospect of a long period of stagnation has not been removed and it has set in motion a negative political dynamic			0
' anybody who finds the prevailing arrangements are intolerable is pushed into an @entity75 posture , so i expect the process of disintegration to gather momentum			0
' differing positions : labour leader @entity38 , left , says his party has no intention to hold an in / out referendum on @entity6 membership , but @entity85 prime minister @entity45 , right , has vowed to hold such a poll in 2017 mr @entity2 , 83 , famously made $ 1billion by betting against the sterling on @entity88 in 1992 , forcing @entity90 's @entity85 government to withdraw from the @entity91			1
but now , he said , any @entity4 withdrawal from @entity43 institutions would hasten the collapse of the @entity6 and diminish the @entity6 's standing in world affairs			1
he predicted disaster if any country were to try to leave the eurozone currency bloc			2
' if the euro disintegrated in a disorderly manner it would not have solved the problem , it would have created an even bigger problem – a real meltdown , ' he was quoted as saying yesterday by @entity107			0
' the problems of the euro do n't have a national solution			0
leaving the euro is a disaster			0
it would mean defaulting on a country 's debts			2
that would have very severe consequences for financial stability			0

‘ @entity124 wants to remain part of the pound sterling and @entity4 is creating obstructions to that , ' he said			2
