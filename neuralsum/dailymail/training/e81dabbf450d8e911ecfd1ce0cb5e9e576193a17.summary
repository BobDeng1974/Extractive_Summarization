@entity0 already is being sued by two neighboring states for legalizing marijuana			1
now , the state faces groundbreaking lawsuits from its own residents , who are asking a federal judge to order the new recreational industry to close			1
the owners of a mountain hotel and a southern @entity0 horse farm argue in a pair of lawsuits filed thursday in @entity13 in @entity14 that the 2012 marijuana - legalization measure has hurt their property and that the marijuana industry is stinky and attracts unsavory visitors			1
the lawsuits are the first in a state that has legalized recreational or medical marijuana in which its own residents are appealing to the federal government to block pot laws			1
@entity25 , spokesperson for the @entity26 , announces that a federal lawsuit is being filed on behalf of two @entity0 citizens by a @entity30 - based group to shut down the state 's $ 800 - million - a - year marijuana industry what are they on ? the lawsuits are the first in any state that has legalized recreational or medical marijuana in which its own residents are appealing to the federal government to block pot laws ' it is a bedrock principle of the @entity41 that federal law is the supreme law of the land , ' said @entity44 , a lawyer representing the plaintiffs			1
the lawsuits are also the first to claim that federal racketeering laws allow them to win damages from pot businesses that flout federal law			1
the plaintiffs have not specified amounts they would seek			0
experts say the racketeering approach is a new one			0
' if these lawsuits are successful , it could be devastating for the industry , ' said @entity59 , a @entity60 law professor who helped craft @entity0 's pot regulations			2
' but it will be very difficult for the plaintiffs to prove damages directly attributable to the marijuana industry			0
' @entity0 attorney general @entity66 released a statement saying she would ' defend the state 's marijuana laws and our clients ' if the lawsuits go to trial			1
marijuana legalization supporters say that states are free to stop enforcing certain drug laws , as long as they do n't try to overrule the federal @entity77			2
smoked out : the lawsuit is being sponsored by a group called the @entity80 , which is based in the nation 's capital and opposes marijuana legalization ' @entity0 has every right to stop punishing adults for using marijuana , ' said @entity25 , who ran @entity0 's legalization campaign and joined about a dozen other legalization supporters who marched to the state @entity90 on thursday			2
they carried signs saying , ' regulation works ! ' one legalization backer , @entity96 state rep. @entity95 , said the pot industry has boosted tax coffers and hurt the black market			0
' the sky has n't fallen			0
we 're doing the right thing , ' @entity95 said			0
technically , federal law making pot illegal for any purpose remains in effect in the 23 states that have authorized its use for people with certain medical conditions			2
however , it 's not clear how far the federal government can go to compel states to enforce drug laws			2
for nearly 20 years , the @entity115 @entity114 has said that marijuana is illegal and that the federal government can enforce even small - possession crimes			1
however , @entity115 authorities have left most enforcement to the states , saying they focus on larger drug crimes			0
one of the lawsuits came from the owner of a @entity126 horse farm , @entity127 , who said thursday that she 's ' been horrified ' to see a marijuana cultivation facility go up next door			0
' this land means a great deal to me , ' said @entity127 , who says the pot facility mars ' spectacular views ' of the @entity136			0
unhappy : in december , @entity0 's marijuana laws were challenged in the @entity115 @entity138 by the neighboring states of @entity140 and @entity141 , which say marijuana sold in @entity0 has been smuggled across state lines also suing is the owner of a @entity145 , who argues that a pot shop opening nearby is keeping away families			1
' marijuana businesses make bad neighbors , ' the lawsuit says			0
' they drive away legitimate businesses ' customers , emit pungent , foul odors , attract undesirable visitors , increase criminal activity , increase traffic , and reduce property values			2
' the owner of the pot shop being sued by the hotel said thursday he had no idea his neighbor even opposed his license			0
he said the hotel owner did not appear at public zoning hearings			0
' it 's kind of silly , ' said @entity169 , owner of @entity170 , which has n't yet opened			0
@entity140 and @entity141 also are suing @entity0 for legalizing marijuana in 2012			1
nine former heads of the @entity173 filed a brief thursday with the @entity115 @entity138 supporting the two states			1
@entity0 's pot law ' impinges on the interests of all citizens and the @entity115 in a uniform and coherent national drug policy , ' the brief says .			1

state residents who say legalized pot violates federal racketeering laws , hurts business and diminishes property values
the complaints were filed in @entity13 in @entity14 by a hotel operator and the owners of a @entity0 horse ranch
@entity0 is among four states where *voters* have approved the possession and sale of marijuana for recreational purposes
laws were challenged in the @entity115 @entity138 by states of @entity140 and ok saying marijuana sold in @entity0 is being smuggled across state lines
