by @entity0 published : 05:03 est , 13 january 2014 updated : 07:54 est , 13 january 2014 his behaviour on this year 's celebrity big brother has been the talk of the nation			0
and now @entity9 's @entity8 bandmate @entity7 has opened up about the singer 's philandering with both glamour model @entity12 and @entity14 actress @entity13 inside the house			1
speaking exclusively to @entity16 , @entity7 said he believes that @entity9 is still entirely unaware of how he is coming across on screen			1
he just goes with what he feels			0
and in his head he probably did n't think he was doing anything wrong			0
in his head he probably thought , " oh well , i 've been handcuffed to this girl @entity32 and she 's really sweet and we had a little kiss and a cuddle " , and in his head that 's normal , that 's fine			2
' but his d * * k is probably telling him , " oh that @entity13 , she 's really fit , i really like that one " , but i think his heart is more in with @entity32 and his d * * k is more thinking about @entity13 if i 'm honest			2
but he 's a typical lad like that			0
i think @entity13 's the kind of girl that he 'd want to take out and have lots of dirty sex with , and @entity32 's the kind of girl that he could take home to his mum and kiss and cuddle in the morning			2
' @entity7 also insisted that @entity32 is n't doing herself any favours by ' playing the victim ' when it comes to @entity9 , and is portraying herself as something of a ' bunny boiler '			1
unaware : @entity7 insisted @entity9 is not aware of the way he is coming across on screen , kissing both @entity13 ( pictured ) and glamour model @entity12 ca n't make up his mind : @entity7 said @entity9 is ' thinking with his d * * k when it comes to @entity13 and his heart with @entity32 ' he said : ' @entity32 , she 's acting like a bunny boiler if i must say so myself			1
and she must have known what @entity9 is like , all you have to do is @entity70 @entity9 and see what he 's been like in the past			2
she 's not that dumb - she 's a 26 - year - old girl and i 'm sure she 's heard about @entity9 before			2
' and i 'm sure she 's read many many stories about what he 's like			0
so do n't be playing the victim and say , " oh , i really like you "			2
i just think you 're a grown woman , you 're not a child , you should be in control of your emotions at that age and know ... and then for her to go back into that botlhole and be like , " oh i 've got no knickers on , how do i kiss , do i kiss good ? " ' selling out ' : @entity7 also spoke about @entity9 's ex @entity85 selling her story on him this weekend ' it 's like , come on girl , you know what you 're doing , you know what you 're playing			1
so do n't make out that you 're this poor heartbroken victim and then go in the toilets and kiss him again - you just make yourself look stupid			0
' @entity7 added that @entity9 entering the house alongside both @entity13 and @entity32 has seen him act like a ' kid in a sweetshop ' , but also revealed that it has been frustrating to watch his bandmate 's actions in the house so far			1
he said : ' seeing him in the house , really liking this @entity13 girl and getting into bed with @entity32 , it 's just a bit like , " @entity9 , come on mate ! " it 's frustrating for me to watch him because i 'm like , " come on mate , you 're 30 now , you 've got a couple of kids , you do n't need to be ... " but he wears his heart on his sleeve , he gets into the moment and he thinks that he 's in love so quickly - he just wants desperately to meet somebody and be happy , because he has had really difficult times in his last relationships and he just wants to meet someone know and be happy , because he 's at that age now where he really wants that			1
' but in that @entity126 house he 's like a kid in a sweetshop , it 's like , what sweet do you go for ? and you 're in a surreal surroundings in a house with people that you 've never met and you 're all thrown together and it 's just a really bizarre experience i can only imagine			0
' @entity7 's comments about @entity9 's actions in the house come as he revealed the real reason for the singer making the decision to take part in the show - to raise money to put his children , son rain and daughter @entity146 , through private education			1
@entity7 explained : ' @entity9 's always wanted to have that family where the mum and dad are together and it 's unity and security within the household			1
and @entity9 was taken around various different schools , got kicked out of various schools , was bullied because he was dyslexic , he did n't feel that he had the education that he needed because a lot of people misunderstood him and he was thrown out rather than being helped			1
and because of the fact that he was dyslexic as a kid , he was bullied with people calling him thick , and he had a really really hard time as a kid doing that			0
' so for him , the most important thing is that his children do n't go through the same pattern that he went through			0
and i think that he 's always wanted to make sure his kids have a great education , they 're taught the best way , and they do n't have to be bullied or tormented because they may have an impairment like dyslexia and that kind of stuff			2
for @entity9 , it 's important that he puts his kids through good eduction and they 're having a good schooling because he does n't want history to repeat itself			1
proud father : @entity9 decided to sign up for @entity183 so that he can finance his children 's private education			1
here , he is pictured with five - year - old son rain motivated : @entity7 said @entity9 does n't want @entity187 and his daughter @entity146 to have the same school life he did ' so for @entity9 , that is why he was so adamant about doing this , because his kids are at an age where they 're about to start school and he just wants the best for his children			1
and i completely understand that because my daughter 's eight , and i got her into an amazing grammar school and now it looks like she 's going to be getting into the @entity200			0
i think as a parent , it 's important to give your kids the best start in life and that is second to none for @entity9 - he wants that more than anything			2
' @entity7 's interview with @entity16 came after @entity85 , the mother of @entity9 's five - year - old son @entity187 , slammed the singer for encouraging the little boy to tune in to his raunchy antics on the show			1
she was quoted as saying : ' what kind of father tells his five - year - old to watch him on tv and then behaves like a porn star ? ' but @entity7 insisted that while @entity9 was fully prepared for stories to come out when he was in the house , the fact that his ex has sold out on him will still be devastating for him			1
daring to bare : @entity9 sported just a pair of tiny pvc pants for the @entity227 task on the show on sunday night r - rated : @entity9 did some pole dancing with @entity230 during the task he said : ' he was always prepared that stories were going to hit when he went in the house			2
and that was one of the things that he actually was worried about and i knew that he was concerned about certain people selling out on him , but the fact of the matter is , i 've been in a similar situation to @entity9			0
' i 've got a daughter which i 'm not in a relationship with the mother but even still , the mother of my child would never sell out on me , because our child would have to see that			0
it does n't matter how old she is , she 's going to grow up and see that , and it 's like , why would mummy and @entity252 do that to each other and air each other 's dirty laundry for all the world to see - that should be private , that should be between you two			0
' and i know because of the conversations i have with @entity262 , who is the mother of my child , that we are like , we would never do that to each other , to harm our child			0
but i think unfortunately , certain people that @entity9 's been involved with do n't think that way			1
and that 's very sad to me because i have a completely different ethos and i know @entity9 does as well - @entity9 's the kind of person that would never spill dirt on something that 's so private like his family			1
' and it 's just very sad that in the past there has been stories and i 'm sure there are going to be more stories coming out and that breaks my heart more than anything , because it 's about the children here and people forget that			0
the kids need to be put first , in all respects , for everything			0
' it 's like , you do n't sell out on somebody for money because it 's like you 're selling your kid , and it 's completely disgusting and wrong			0
but that 's my own personal view			0
' stage star : @entity7 told @entity16 that he always looked after @entity9 and saw him like a little brother			1

@entity7 said @entity9 's true feelings probably lie with @entity32
he added that @entity32 is n't doing herself any favours by playing the victim
@entity7 revealed @entity9 signed up to the show to be able to finance his children 's private education
