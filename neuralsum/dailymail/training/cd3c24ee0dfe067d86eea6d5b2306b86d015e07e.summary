‘ if he ca n’t say what has happened , i do n’t see how he can appeal			0
’ @entity17 ’s appeal , which was confirmed by the @entity38 yesterday , comes as the @entity5 reveals he received £ 150,000 in legal aid while dragging april ’s family through the courts			1
even though the killer confessed to her death when he was arrested last october , he claimed it was an accident , forcing april ’s parents to endure five weeks of harrowing evidence at trial			0
@entity47 and @entity7 said they felt ‘ tortured ’ as a result			0
‘ he ’s put us through so much			0
it ’s like he ’s taunting us , like he wants to show he ’s got the upper hand , ’ mrs @entity49 said			0
he ’s in prison where he belongs and he should stay there			0
he ’s just torturing my family with these legal battles			0
’ appeal : @entity2 , left , is appealing against his imprisonment for killing five - year - old @entity2 , right politicians and campaigners said taxpayers would be ‘ disgusted ’ to know they had funded the monster ’s cruel show in court with a six - figure legal aid bill			1
and with his appeal due at the @entity67 next month , that amount is set to rise by an estimated £ 20,000			2
april was abducted on the evening of october 1 last year as she played on her pink bicycle close to her home on the @entity74 - y - @entity73 estate in @entity75 , @entity76			1
former slaughterman @entity17 , 48 , who kept child porn and pictures of dead youngsters on his laptop , lured april into his @entity81 and drove her to his remote rented home before brutally sexually assaulting her , killing her and disposing of her body			1
months of exhaustive police searches failed to find the child ’s body			0
@entity17 told police that he had killed april but has adamantly refused to reveal what he did with her body			1
anguish : the victim 's parents @entity47 and @entity7 have spoken of their anger at hearing the news april ’s blood and 17 fragments of skull were later discovered in his house			1
the tiny pieces of bone are all her parents were able to bury at her funeral in september			0
despite his confession , @entity17 pleaded not guilty to the charges against him , subjecting her grieving parents to the horror of a five - week trial			1
represented by top criminal barrister @entity112 , @entity111 ’s substantial legal costs were funded by the public			0
@entity17 , a father of six , was sentenced to die in jail by mr justice @entity115 at @entity116			2
the judge said he had ‘ no doubt there can be only one sentence ’ , handing him a whole life tariff			2
‘ the grief of april ’s parents can not be over-stated			0
they lived with the torment of a missing daughter ... and they have had to endure the spectacle of your hypocritical sympathy for their loss and of your tears , flowing not because of any regret for your crimes , but because of your enduring self pity			0
’ jailed : @entity17 is one of just 49 people in @entity137 currently serving whole life sentences @entity17 has now appealed his sentence and , because he is covered by legal aid , his challenge will also be paid for by taxpayers			1
@entity144 mp @entity143 said : ‘ it beggars belief that @entity2 can claim such a huge sum of public money			0
’ @entity150 , from the @entity151 ’ @entity149 , added : ‘ given the horrendous nature of @entity2 ’s crime , most people will find it disgusting that they have funded his trial with a six - figure bill			0
’ earlier this year , @entity17 tried to claim compensation following an attack by a fellow inmate at the top security @entity161 in @entity162			1
in total , it is believed @entity17 ’s refusal to accept any responsibility for his heinous crimes has cost the public about £ 9million , including £ 8.5million for the biggest search in the history of @entity137 policing .			1
