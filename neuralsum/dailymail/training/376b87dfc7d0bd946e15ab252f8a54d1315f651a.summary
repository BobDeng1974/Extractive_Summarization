by @entity0 trying to spot your friend in a crowded room can be tricky			0
your brain has to retrieve the memory of their face , and then hold it in place while scanning the crowd			0
but the brain is able to make the task simpler by paying special attention to objects , according to a new study			1
screen shots from a video of overlapping images of faces and houses , shown to subjects who were asked to pay attention to one or the other scientists in @entity33 have found that a part of the brain , known as the inferior frontal junction ( @entity37 ) , controls visual processing areas for objects			1
they hope their understanding of the process behind concentration could someday develop techniques that will help people with short attention spans focus more easily			1
currently , scientists know much less about object - based attention , such as recognising a face , than spatial attention , which involves focusing on what 's happening in a particular location			2
‘ the interactions are surprisingly similar to those seen in spatial attention , ’ said @entity17 's ( @entity17 's ) @entity52			1
‘ it seems like it 's a parallel process involving different areas			0
’ if you ca n’t resist the chance to put on a bet , blame your insula			0
scientists think that when this brain area is overactive , the heart rules our head and we ca n’t help but chase our losses			2
the @entity70 researchers said : ‘ future treatments for gambling addiction could seek to reduce this hyperactivity , either by drugs or psychological techniques			0
’ the researchers made the link after asking people with various brain injuries and healthy people play slot machine and roulette - style computer games			2
a near miss on the slot machines made the players , except those with the damaged insulas , extra-keen to try their luck again			0
similarly , the scientists found that all of the players , apart from those with faulty insulas , made a common mistake when they played roulette			0
@entity17 researchers used magnetoencephalography ( @entity98 ) to scan human subjects as they viewed a series of overlapping images of faces and houses			1
unlike functional magnetic resonance imaging ( @entity105 ) , which is commonly used to measure brain activity , @entity98 can reveal the precise timing of neural activity , down to the millisecond			0
the researchers presented the overlapping streams at two different rhythms — two images per second and 1.5 images per second — allowing them to identify brain regions responding to those images			0
each subject was told to pay attention to either faces or houses ; because the houses and faces were in the same spot , the brain could not use spatial information to distinguish them			1
the researchers found in both types of focus , the prefrontal cortex - the control centre for most brain functions - appears to take charge			2
when the subjects were told to look for faces , activity in different regions of the brain became synchronised , suggesting that they were communicating with each other			2
@entity17 researchers used magnetoencephalography ( pictured ) to scan human subjects as they viewed a series of overlapping images of faces and houses when the subjects paid attention to houses , the @entity37 synchronised with a region known as the parahippocampal place area ( @entity150 ) , which interprets information about places			1
the researchers believe that the @entity37 holds onto the idea of the object that the brain is looking for and directs the correct part of the brain to look for it			0
@entity17 scientists are now studying how the brain shifts its focus between different types of sensory input , such as vision and hearing			1
they are also investigating whether it might be possible to train people to better focus their attention by controlling the brain interactions involved in this process .			1

study identified a brain circuit that shifts focus between different objects
known as the inferior frontal junction , it helps focus on and pick out faces
@entity17 scientists now plan to find out how the brain shifts its focus between different types of sensory input , such as vision and hearing
they are also investigating whether it might be possible to train people to better focus their attention by controlling different brain processes
