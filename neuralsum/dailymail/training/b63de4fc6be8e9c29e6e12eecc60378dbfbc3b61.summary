by @entity0 published : 06:06 est , 22 june 2013 updated : 06:36 est , 22 june 2013 the @entity1 has spent £ 850,000 moving and upgrading a visitor centre even though it only received 50,000 people a year			1
in contrast , the @entity4 in the @entity6 town of @entity7 , receives more than 80,000 visitors a year , who pay up to £ 4.25 a head for entry			1
attendance at the free @entity14 dropped in 2012 by 5 per cent on the previous year			1
upgrade : relocating and renovating the @entity14 cost taxpayers £ 853,000 ( 1million euros ) hub : the new visitor centre is based inside the @entity14 's @entity17 in @entity18 but despite the decline in numbers , the @entity1 lavished taxpayer 's money on relocating the centre to a different @entity18 street this spring			1
the new centre , which is now opposite the @entity14 's headquarters , opened in may			1
it sits just half a mile from the @entity29 's @entity28 , which opened in 2012 at a cost of nearly £ 18million			2

mrs @entity38 said : ' the @entity1 thinks that it can win over citizens with extravagant visitors ’ centres such as those hosted by the @entity14 and the @entity29			1
' the parliament lavished a shameful £ 18m on its temple of @entity1 propaganda and now we learn that a further million @entity47 has been spent on another centre half a mile away			0
' the @entity1 needs to rein in the outlandish budget for publicising itself			0
if it buckled down and did a better job , including by cutting back waste , it might find it needed less money to spend on hype			0
' success : the @entity4 in @entity55 receives more than 80,000 visitors a year - 30,000 more than the @entity14 attraction : visitors pay up to £ 4.25 a head entry for the @entity4 , while the @entity14 centre is free in response to the @entity64 's written question , @entity14 vice-president @entity61 said : ' @entity65 is an integral part and key instrument of its communication strategy			1
