@entity1 , the party ’s business spokesman condemned the ‘ lazy stereotypes ’ that mean too many strong black role models are ‘ ignored ’			1
mr @entity1 also said it was ‘ unacceptable ’ that @entity5 black actors could not achieve mainstream success in the @entity5 without first breaking @entity6			1
in a speech to mark @entity25 , mr @entity1 criticised the lack of black role models across the professions			1
he said : ‘ if young black people ca n’t see people who look like them editing our newspapers , sitting on the @entity33 or running our great @entity5 companies , how can we give them the hope that if they work hard , they can make it too ? ‘ you see , shining a light on our role models is crucial because too many of them are ignored			2
’ and he said one of the reasons for this was that ‘ the broadcast and film media have a tendency to stereotype black people : to present an image of black @entity5 people that suggests we can succeed in sport , entertainment and music , but not necessarily in other fields ’			2
mr @entity1 , seen as a rising @entity9 star , also raised the issue of many black @entity5 actors having to leave the @entity5 for the @entity6 to get better roles			1
he said : ‘ too many in the @entity5 film and television industries simply do n’t cast black @entity5 actors in certain roles that fall outside those stereotypes			2
‘ it ’s often only after they ’ve made it big in the @entity66 that black @entity5 actors get more – and more varied – roles here			2
' that is unacceptable and has got to change			0
as a society , we can not allow people to default to lazy stereotypes			0
’ breakthrough : @entity75 's @entity74 secured the lead in @entity77 hit @entity78 after playing a drugs baron in @entity6 drama the wire his comments come after @entity84 performer @entity83 encouraged ‘ young black @entity5 actors to get to @entity6 if they have ambition ’			1
he said it was a fact that aspiring actors would have to follow the lead of @entity90 , @entity74 and himself by crossing the @entity92 in search of success			0
mr @entity74 , from @entity75 in @entity95 , landed the lead in @entity77 drama @entity78 only after establishing himself by playing a drugs baron in @entity6 tv series @entity100			1
mr @entity83 secured a role in @entity102 after sending producers an audition tape , while mr @entity90 – who starred in @entity105 – has expressed his frustration with the process of securing lead roles			0
struggle : @entity90 ( left ) , who starred in the @entity77 's @entity105 , headed for @entity6 in search of more lead roles while @entity83 , who has bemoaned the lack of roles in the @entity5 , played @entity114 in @entity6 hit @entity102 in his speech , mr @entity1 said : ‘ as a non-white person in @entity5 today , you ’re twice as likely to be unemployed as a white person			1
if you are a young black graduate , you ’ll earn on average only three quarters of what a white graduate earns			0
‘ if you have an @entity123 - sounding surname , you need to send about twice as many job applications as those with traditional @entity127 names – not even to get a job – but just to get an interview			0
’ he added : ‘ and i ’m being generous here			0
i have n’t gone into the over-representation of black people in the criminal justice and mental health systems – or the disproportionate numbers of young black @entity137 boys , say , being excluded in our schools			0
