an ointment that painlessly melts away fat has been hailed as ‘ an eye - lift in a bottle ’ by experts			2
the treatment – known only by its experimental name of @entity7 – has been shown to significantly reduce bags under the eyes			1
its makers say it could also be used to dissolve double chins and even be employed on the body , particularly on stomach fat			1
the praise follows yesterday ’s annual meeting of the @entity17 , where @entity19 bio-tech company @entity18 presented details of a trial of 90 patients , aged between 40 and 70 , who applied the cream once a day to their under - eye area for ten weeks			1
stock photo the trial was double - blind and placebo - controlled , meaning that neither the participants nor the researchers knew which patients belonged to the control group or the test group			2
bags were graded on a four - point scale , and in ratings given by independent doctors , just under half of those using @entity7 were found to have improved by one full grade in both eyes , with some seeing a two - grade improvement			1
dr @entity43 , @entity18 ’s chief scientific officer , said : ‘ a one - grade improvement may sound small , but it is a meaningful change			0
participants said they felt they looked more youthful , more attractive and more well rested after treatment			0
’ eye bags , or steatoblepharon , are fat pads under the eye socket that bulge forwards			1
although numerous factors , including lack of sleep and allergies , can lead to fluid accumulation in these tissues , they are typically a permanent part of the facial structure			0
their appearance worsens with age as the ligaments holding the pads in place soften			0
when applied , @entity7 is absorbed through the skin and into fat tissue			1
it binds to receptors on the surface of fat cells , causing them to expel their oil contents , reducing their size			0
it also prevents new fat cells from forming			0
the makers of the cream say it could also be used to dissolve double chins and even be employed on the body , particularly on stomach fat			1
file photo the ointment ’s active ingredient – a compound known as a prostaglandin – was initially developed as a treatment for glaucoma , or high pressure in the eyeball , given as eye drops			2
however , while testing the drug , doctors noticed that fat around they eyes began to disappear within weeks – called prostaglandin - associated periorbitopathy , or @entity94			1
however , as well as losing their eye bags , some patients also developed deeper or ‘ sunken ’ eyes			1
previously , @entity94 has been seen as an unwanted side effect of a different prostaglandin used in another prescription - only cosmetic cream @entity100 , which causes the eyelashes to grow			0
in rare cases , the drug also causes irreversible brown pigment to appear in the eye			0
but dr @entity43 said that @entity7 was a different type of prostaglandin , and trials had seen ‘ no effects on the eye , including iris hyperpigmentation ’			2
@entity19 professor of ophthalmology , dr @entity114 , who has written papers on @entity94 , said this type of fat loss could make people with loose , puffy , baggy lids and loose skin look better			0
‘ for some patients who might be candidates for plastic surgery , this could be thought of as a “ blepharoplasty [ eye lift ] in a bottle ” , ’ he added			0
however , @entity129 - based dermatologist dr @entity128 said : ‘ surgery is currently the only option to treat eye bags due to fat accumulation			2
’ yet while this is effective and permanent , surgeons may inadvertently remove too much fat , which can leave people looking hollow - eyed and permanently surprised			0
in contrast , when @entity7 is discontinued , the results reverse			2
@entity7 , which would be a prescription - only cream to be applied at home once a day , is now undergoing further testing .			1
