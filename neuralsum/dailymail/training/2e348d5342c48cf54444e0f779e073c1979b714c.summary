by @entity0 published : 20:11 est , 15 november 2013 updated : 20:56 est , 15 november 2013 there 's nothing like @entity4 dinner to spark a good squabble			0
and it looks like the celebrity chefs have already cooked up the first one of the season – with a debate over how to roast potatoes			2
you may have always done it the way granny told you , but according to @entity16 you need beef dripping to get the perfect result			1
his forthright comments put him at loggerheads with other celebrity chefs , notably @entity23 who has long championed goose fat as the secret ingredient for rich and crisp roast potatoes			1
festive fight : @entity16 and @entity23 are at loggerheads over how to make the best roasties @entity16 , better known for his bizarre creations than traditional tastes , said : ‘ goose fat might make them crispy , but using beef dripping to cook them will give your roasties an unbeatable flavour that will make sure your festive feast is talked about well into the new year			1
‘ i use beef dripping every time – it beats goose fat hands down			1
’ @entity44 , however , has been hailing goose fat as the must - have @entity4 ingredient for years			2
supermarket sales of the product more than doubled after she sang its praises in 2006			0
she favours it over other fats because its high smoking point – the point at which the oil burns – produces rich potatoes that stay crisp long after roasting			0
the heat of the fat is ‘ crucial ’ , she has said , because ‘ if it ’s not searingly hot , you do n’t stand a chance , and since goose fat has a very high smoking point and tastes good , it is my annual choice			0
’ pro-goose : @entity68 's @entity67 says she uses goose fat for her potatoes @entity67 is another to have publicly backed goose fat			1
‘ it makes all the difference to the flavour of roast potatoes			2
‘ do n’t use too much , though , as this will simply make the potatoes go soggy , ’ the @entity76 off star has said			0
@entity79 also swears by goose fat , having included it in his roast potato recipe on his @entity84 show @entity83			2
three - @entity85 starred @entity87 chef @entity16 ’s ardent backing of beef dripping may come as something of a surprise to those who follow his pronouncements closely			1
in the past he has taken a far more relaxed view to his choice of cooking fats and oils			0
last year he said : ‘ personally , i ’d use beef dripping if i was serving the potatoes with roast beef , and duck fat if i was serving them with duck , but as an all - round one , go for olive oil			1
’ that view put him in tune with @entity107 , who also advocates using the fat from whatever meat is being roasted , or lard if there is nothing else			0
the 72 - year - old was the face of @entity115 for three years along with @entity16 until she was dropped ‘ by mutual agreement ’ from the store ’s adverts earlier this year			0
@entity115 ’s executive chef @entity119 recently backed @entity16 ’s support for dripping			0
he said : ‘ @entity4 is the time of year to showcase culinary skills ... and beef dripping is a vital ingredient in creating something extraordinary			2
’ battle : @entity16 insists that beef dripping is ' a vital ingredient ' that will give potatoes the best flavour			1
