scientists have made sense of why some of us have no sense of direction			1
they ’ve pinpointed signals in the human brain that determine how good we are at navigating			1
this inbuilt compass tells us which way were are facing and works out which way to turn to go where we want			1
and in those with a poor sense of direction , the signals are fuzzier			1
the cells that sense north - for example , light up when we face north – and also spring to life when we think about turning to the north the researchers , from @entity19 , scanned the brains of 16 men and women as they played a computer game that tested their ability to navigate			2
the results suggest that we have networks of brain cells dedicated to specific compass points , such as north and south			2
the cells that sense north light up when we face north – and also spring to life when we think about turning to the north			2
if we are facing north but planning to walk east , two sets of cells are involved			2
all of the cells are found in a part of the brain called the entorhinal region			1
researcher dr @entity47 said : ‘ in this simple test , we were looking to see which areas of the brain were active when participants were considering different directions			1
‘ we were surprised to see that the strength and consistency of brain signals from the entorhinal region noticeably influenced people ’s performance in such a basic task			1
studies suggest that a cab driver 's brain may change to accommodate an internal ' map ' of their city cabbies who have memorised @entity68 's 25,000 streets and landmarks have a larger volume of ' grey matter '			1
but this change only occurs in those who successfully pass the exams			0
studies suggest that the brain may change to accommodate an internal ' map ' of @entity68			2
only around half of trainees finally make the grade as @entity68 taxi drivers by passing the knowledge test			0
scientists followed a group of 79 trainee drivers and a ' control group ' of 31 non-taxi drivers			2
mri scans were used to take brain structure ' snapshots ' of the volunteers , who were also given certain memory tasks			2
at the start of the study , there were no obvious differences between participants ' brains			0
three to four years later , significant differences were seen			0
the 39 trainees who qualified had greater volumes of grey matter in their posterior hippocampus than the 40 who failed , or the non-taxi drivers			0
‘ this type of “ homing signal ” has been thought to exist for many years , but until now it has remained purely speculation			0
’ dr @entity109 , lead author of the study , said : ‘ our results provide evidence to support the idea that your internal “ compass ” readjusts as you move through the environment			0
‘ if you get lost after taking too many turns , this may be because your brain could not keep up and failed to adjust your facing and goal directions			1
’ with just 16 people taking part in the study , the researchers were n’t able to tell if there is a difference between the sexes ’ ability to navigate			0
if we are facing north but planning to walk east , two sets of cells are involved			2
all of the cells are found in a part of the brain called the entorhinal region ( red ) dr @entity47 said : ‘ my guess is that there probably is n’t			1
‘ some studies have shown that women have a better visual memory – you can show them a scene and they will remember it better than men			0
‘ men , in contrast , can work with the geometry and rotate things in their mind better			0
‘ but when you bring it all together , the difference disappears			0
’ the research , published in the journal @entity157 , could lead to ways of training the brain to improve sense of direction			1
it could also help shed light in dementia			0
the entorhinal region is one of the first parts of the brain affected by alzheimer ’s disease , so the findings may also help to explain why people start to get lost in the early stages of the disease			1
it is hoped that a version of the navigation test used in study could be used detect @entity179 ’s early and monitor its progress			1
this year ’s @entity180 was awarded to another @entity19 researcher for work on our inner ‘ sat nav ’			0
dr @entity184 , of @entity185 which funded the latest research , said : ‘ neuroscientists have made huge advances in our understanding of how we navigate space , widely recognised after this year ’s @entity192 prizes , and this research is yet another step forward			0
‘ why some people are better navigators than others is intrinsically interesting , but it also helps us explain the processes that go wrong in people with degenerative brain disorders such as dementia			0
‘ an estimated 850,000 people are living with dementia in the @entity205 , many of whom suffer deterioration in their navigational skills , leaving them lost and confused			1

scientists were able to predict navigational skills based on a brain scan
activity *increases* in ' entorhinal ' region when someone follows directions
in those with a poor sense of direction , the signals in this area are fuzzier
this is the same region we use to work out which direction we are facing
brain region is affected by @entity179 's explaining why sufferers get lost
