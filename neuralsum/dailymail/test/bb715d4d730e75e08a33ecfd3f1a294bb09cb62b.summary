some of the @entity1 's less glamorous clubs face a battle this summer to keep hold of their brightest stars who have caught the eye of the ' big boys '			0
the likes of @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 are wanted men as @entity14 heavyweights like @entity15 and @entity17 circle like vultures			1
@entity19 looks at 10 players who could be taking a ‘ step up ’ this summer			0
@entity9 ( @entity21 ) wanted by : @entity15 , @entity23 , @entity22 valued at : £ 25m destined to be the most wanted player of the summer after an excellent season in midfield for @entity21			1
@entity27 has long seen the @entity28 as an ideal holding player for @entity15 while @entity23 boss @entity30 worked with him at @entity31 's			2
now @entity32 is joining the chase , believing a @entity35 - @entity9 axis will help @entity22 conquer @entity36			1
@entity9 has shown this season that he is good enough to play @entity14 football @entity21 convinced @entity9 to stay at the club last summer , but he is now ready to leave @entity21 dug in a year ago to persuade @entity9 to stay on the south coast but it is going to be virtually impossible to keep him again given that the 25 - year - old has been putting in @entity14 - standard performances all season and is coming into his prime			1
@entity45 ( @entity46 ) wanted by : @entity47 , @entity17 valued at : £ 5m ( compensation ) the @entity50 under 21 striker is out of contract in the summer and has no intention of staying at @entity53 regardless of whether @entity46 keep their @entity1 status			1
financially , he would make an excellent acquisition for a top club given the compensation for a @entity58 would only be around a third of his true market value			0
@entity47 are interested - to sign a striker who turns 23 in july and who has scored nine @entity1 goals this season , without having to pay a hefty transfer fee , is a no - brainer for the moneyball approach			1
but they face competition from @entity17			2
@entity45 is out of contract this summer and his scoring exploits have made him a target for top clubs @entity46 are resigned to losing @entity45 on a free and will only receive a modest compensation fee for him @entity11 ( @entity21 ) wanted by : @entity17 valued at : £ 17m after a season in which he made his @entity50 debut , 24 - year - old @entity11 is destined to follow his former @entity77 team - mate @entity76 to @entity78 – but is fully expected to enjoy more success			1
the right back , who once helped @entity83 club @entity77 win a @entity85 match at @entity17 , has been one of the revelations of the season at @entity31 's this season and made it clear he wo n't enter talks about a new contract			2
@entity93 has made a right back a priority this summer and @entity11 is the red - hot favourite			0
@entity93 has made @entity21 full back @entity11 his top priority this summer @entity11 's impressive form for @entity21 has earned him a regular spot in the @entity50 team @entity102 ( @entity103 ) wanted by : @entity104 , @entity22 valued at : £ 12m arrived in the @entity1 via @entity106 and @entity107 , and the left back 's performances for @entity103 have alerted both @entity104 and @entity22 , who need strengthening in that position and are both short of homegrown players			1
@entity113 , 25 , has been an ever - present for @entity103 this season and even though he signed a new contract last summer , the @entity112 club are willing to extend it to 2020			0
@entity102 scored a superb free - kick against @entity119 last weekend to raise his market value @entity104 and @entity22 are interested in the defender , but @entity103 are hopeful he will stay @entity10 ( @entity77 ) wanted by : @entity47 valued at : £ 10m the 25 - year - old winger has been one of the surprise breakthrough players of the season with a hat - trick at @entity126 last weekend answering the call from manager @entity128 for more goals to go alongside his undoubted ability			1
@entity10 , a @entity132 international , is one of the most naturally gifted and unpredictable players in the division and a major reason @entity77 are now an established force in the top flight			0
@entity47 and @entity23 like to play with width and both need a player who is comfortable on the left - hand side			1
@entity10 has been in superb form for @entity77 this season and could be a target @entity10 celebrates after netting a hat - trick against @entity126 and he is wanted by @entity47 in the summer @entity146 ( @entity147 ) wanted by : @entity47 , @entity23 valued at : £ 10m @entity146 has been outstanding in a struggling side and his tally of 17 @entity1 goals is the fourth - best in the division and only two behind @entity153 , @entity154 and @entity155 who are with clubs at the other end of the table			1
it seems inevitable @entity160 will move on should @entity161 get relegated			0
@entity47 need a natural goalscorer with @entity163 and @entity164 set to leave in the summer while @entity23 do n't want to be over-reliant on @entity155			2
@entity146 is only a couple of goals short of the league 's leading scorers and is a target for @entity47 spurs are also interested in the @entity50 striker as they look for a partner for @entity155 up front @entity174 ( @entity175 ) wanted by : @entity23 valued at : £ 15m the @entity50 under 21 striker has made headlines for the wrong reasons this season and received a 12 - month driving ban in january after being convicted of drink - driving			1
on the pitch , his 18 goals in all competitions have underlined his goalscoring potential and @entity23 have taken note			0
@entity175 's early valuation of around £ 25m appears overly optimistic but if the @entity175 decide to be more realistic in negotiations , there is every chance he could fulfil his dream of moving to a bigger club			0
@entity174 has scored 18 times this season although his off - field actions have caused controversy @entity198 ( @entity199 ) wanted by : @entity15 , @entity17 valued at : £ 12m @entity199 's scouting system came up trumps when they paid £ 1m to @entity202 for the little - known forward in august			1
since then , @entity203 has displayed some of the quickest feet seen in the @entity1 and scored five goals , including the winner against @entity47			2
at 21 , @entity203 is far from the finished article but @entity27 and @entity93 have spotted his potential , particularly as this is his debut season in @entity50			0
@entity203 has impressed since joining @entity199 for a small fee last summer and could move on again @entity211 ( @entity212 ) wanted by : @entity104 valued at : £ 40m it may be harsh for @entity212 fans for their club not to be included as a ' big club ' but that 's the reality when it comes to young international players like @entity211 ; they are in the bottom half of the table and have sold the likes of @entity222 , @entity223 and @entity224 in their prime			2
@entity211 has been compared with @entity226 for his ability to dribble and hold defenders off			0
this has been a difficult season by his standards but @entity104 , always on the lookout for the best homegrown players , believe he has the ability to go all the way			0
@entity211 may not have had the best of seasons but he is still a target for some of the league 's top sides @entity211 has retained his @entity50 place , and would be a key signing for clubs short of homegrown talent @entity246 ( @entity247 ) wanted by : @entity22 , @entity104 valued at : £ 15m the teenage midfielder signed a four - year deal at @entity247 earlier this season so it would take a big push by @entity22 or @entity104 to prise him away this summer			1
nonetheless , a stand - out performance by @entity253 in sunday 's @entity255 semi-final against @entity47 could persuade them			2
if @entity211 gets by defenders with strength and strong running , the nimble - footed @entity253 seems to escape his markers in the tightest of spaces			0
if comparing him with @entity262 is a bit exaggerated , think @entity266 's former @entity265 player , @entity264			0
@entity246 has broken through this season at @entity247 and is wanted by @entity22 and @entity104			0
