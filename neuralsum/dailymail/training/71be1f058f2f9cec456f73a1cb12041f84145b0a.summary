stormy relationship : @entity13 and @entity14 display their wedding rings , but their marriage failed to last but research by personality experts suggests the secret is not being too close to each other but as close as makes you happy - even if that means being very different			1
those annoying couples who seem to agree with each other all the time may find they are actually too close for comfort , said the study by @entity32 in the @entity33			1
observers often noted that @entity13 and @entity14 seemed so similar in fiery personality that they appeared to find it as hard to live together as they did to live apart			1
