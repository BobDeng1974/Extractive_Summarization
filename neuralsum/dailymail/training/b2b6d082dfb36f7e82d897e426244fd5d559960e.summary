the @entity1 government has announced that it will provide medical cannabis to children suffering from extreme forms of epilepsy and may even consider growing its own supply			1
the government will work with a panel to create a a @entity8 , and with their help will decide whether medical cannabis can be sourced from overseas			1
if the cannabis can not be imported , the @entity12 has confirmed that the government are prepared to spearhead a homegrown medical cannabis industry in @entity15			1
the breakthrough comes just days after @entity29 premier @entity28 spoke about his plans to legalise the drug			2
mr @entity19 said the government aims to establish a @entity33 which will include @entity1 chief medical officer , dr @entity35 , and employees from the @entity37			1
speaking to @entity38 , mr @entity19 said something needs to be done about the use of medical cannabis in @entity15 , if there is proof it helps sufferers			1
if the cannabis can not be imported , the @entity12 has confirmed that the government are prepared to spearhead a homegrown medical cannabis industry ' once we have the clinical evidence that medical cannabis can reduce suffering then the government will consider a range of supply measures , including importation			1
but if that does not prove successful then the government will assume responsibility for supply itself , ' mr @entity19 said			1
however , dr @entity56 from @entity57 in @entity58 , told the paper that only a small number of children will benefit from this research , as some might not respond well to the drug			2

doctors told @entity82 last year that her daughter @entity84 would live only a few months as a result of @entity86 , a rare genetic condition that results in uncontrolled and violent seizures sometimes lasting up to 45 minutes , as well as a range of physical and mental disabilities			0
after months of failed treatment , and on the verge of admitting @entity92 to a palliative care unit , @entity82 bought some liquid medical marijuana from a supplier in @entity96 and snuck it into the hospital and put it into @entity84 's feeding tube			2
the results on @entity84 were astonishing , doctors told @entity82 last year that her daughter @entity84 would live only a few months as a result of @entity86 , a rare genetic condition that results in uncontrolled and violent seizures sometimes lasting up to 45 minutes , as well as a range of physical and mental disabilities ' the seizures were less intense , they were n't as long and she was n't having as many of them , ' @entity82 told @entity105 ' the seizures were less intense , they were n't as long and she was n't having as many of them , ' @entity82 told @entity105			0
' i started her on it without the knowledge of the staff at the hospital â€¦ they were quite surprised because they did n't know what was going on			0
the paediatrician commented on how well she was looking			0
' but @entity82 says it was likely @entity84 would die in the next few months , after her supply of medicinal cannabis dried up			0
@entity82 has enough medicinal cannabis to last @entity84 for six weeks and no prospect of getting more since her cannabis supplier was raided in february			0
