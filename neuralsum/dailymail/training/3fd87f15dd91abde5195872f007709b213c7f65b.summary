by @entity0 @entity1 : 19:35 est , 30 december 2013 @entity2 : 19:38 est , 30 december 2013 at first , producer @entity3 thought she had an intruder on her hands			1
giant cuddly teddy bears kept appearing one - by - one outside her bedroom door , ready to greet her as she rose for work			2
then one morning the mystery was solved as a real - life cat burglar , @entity12 , peered in through the cat flap surreptitiously carrying a soft giant doughnut			1
@entity3 , 32 and her partner @entity15 , 32 with their cat @entity12 who has been stealing soft toys the tortie oriental pedigree treated her owners to 17 toys in a single month the five - year - old feline dragged its find through the flap and thoughtfully deposited it in on the kitchen floor			1
nearly a month later , miss @entity3 , who lives with her partner @entity15 , both 33 , in central @entity27 , had been treated to a total of 17 cuddly toys – ranging from a @entity31 gladiator to a @entity33 bear			1
while the couple could not be sure , it appeared @entity12 , a tortie oriental pedigree , was stealing the toys from its neighbours ’ homes			1
@entity12 was caught in the act of cat burgling while bringing this soft doughnut in through the cat flap while @entity3 and @entity15 theorise that the cat is getting the toys from neighbour 's gardens , they do n't know for certain where they 're coming from miss @entity3 said : ‘ i think they must have been from someone ’s garden , although she could have been going into other people ’s houses			1
‘ my sister said the neighbours would be really cross but it ’s not my fault the cat is a thief			1
’ @entity12 is a rescue pet that was given to the couple along with its sister @entity64 nearly a year ago			1
the cat , which has had the official name @entity68 , is quite a find because it is classed as @entity70 , having won three awards for its beauty and temperament			2
but when it was brought into the family home it started turning its paws to other talents			2
miss @entity3 said the first teddy the cat brought in was earlier this year and was a small mr @entity82 teddy			1
she said : ‘ it was small and i thought she obviously found that in a garden			2
the cat burglar was helpfully depositing her finds outside the bedroom and on the kitchen floor while @entity3 hopes the toys are coming from gardens , she can not rule out that @entity12 is going into other houses ‘ then she brought in a second one the next day which was a @entity33 teddy			1
’ she said the cat has a weakness for teddy bears , adding : ‘ she basically stole teddy bears and only teddy bears			2
‘ it obviously has some sort of fetish , the nylon , synthetic material must somehow appeal to her			0
‘ she used to leave them outside the bedroom door for us , it was really funny			0
i came home one day and there were three massive teddy bears in the house			0
’ but having not seen the cat in action – and with many of toys being larger than @entity12 itself , miss @entity3 was not entirely convinced it was the cat bringing them in			1
she said : ‘ i was on the phone to my friend who was saying maybe you have an intruder that is bringing the teddies in – the cat would n’t be bringing in massive teddy bears			0
‘ then at the moment the cat came through the cat flap with a giant doughnut			1
size does n't seem to matter for @entity12 who is happy to drag a full sized teddy bear back to her owners @entity3 and @entity12 have now moved to a flat with a walled garden , putting an end to her criminal ways ‘ i thought , this is really weird			1
then another day i thought she had caught a mouse as something was squeaking but then i realised it was a squeaking teddy bear and it has just gone on from there			0
‘ i woke up one day with an @entity146 bear in my bed			0
i ’ve also had a hanging mobile from a baby ’s pram			0
‘ she has brought loads of them that are bigger than her and she ’s climbing along fences with these teddy bears			0
she must have really strong jaws			0
’ the 17th gift appeared as the couple were having dinner in the garden one weekend			0
a giant teddy bear dropped on them from the fence above their heads			0
miss @entity3 added : ‘ a big brown bear fell on our table and she came to see us , we actually saw her in action			2
it ’s sweet the way she offered them as gifts , she ’s a bonkers cat			0
’ the couple have now moved to a flat where there is a walled garden so the cat can not get out and @entity181 said : ‘ we have been able to stop her burgling			1
‘ although in the first week in our new flat the little boy in the flat above lost his teddy bear as it had fallen from his window			0
@entity12 found it within seconds			2
she came rushing in to our new flat with it in her mouth			0

@entity12 the five - year - old tortie oriental pedigree has been stealing
she brought back 17 soft toys in a month from neighbours
caught by owner @entity3 dragging a soft *doghnut* through cat flap
now she lives in a flat with a walled garden , ending the crime *spree*
