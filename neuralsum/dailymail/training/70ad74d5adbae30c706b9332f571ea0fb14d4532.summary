i was a different person			1
since this all happened i am more positive ' mr @entity23 was second - in - command of a patrol circling their remote @entity52 in @entity24			2

i looked at one of the lads and i could see he was in shock			0

' pre-accident : @entity23 was serving in @entity24 in december 2007 when his life changed forever at this point @entity23 begged a colleague to put a bullet in his brain			1

back at @entity115 ’s @entity114 , where all wounded servicemen are treated , @entity23 began his long road to recovery			0

when i was on leave i would stay out all night and sleep on my mates ’ sofas			0
' i used to be a lot more selfish			0
i was a different person			0
since this all happened i am more positive			0
' i ’ve not got any internal injuries			1
i think i ’ve got the best of a bad situation			0
' mr @entity23 is working for the @entity148 , a charitable group where he can support former servicemen in exactly the same way he has been helped			0
