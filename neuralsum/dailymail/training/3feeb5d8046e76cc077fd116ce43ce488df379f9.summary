@entity1 fans may need to wait even longer to get their hands , or wrists , on the tech giant 's upcoming smartwatch			2
despite initial reports claiming it would go on sale in february 2015 , a leaked statement - made to @entity1 employees - suggests the release has been delayed until ' the spring			1
' according to @entity15 , @entity12 , @entity1 's senior vice president of retail and online stores said : ' we ’re going into the holidays , we ’ll go into @entity18 , and then we ’ve got a new watch launch coming in the spring			1

he did n't announce exactly when the watch would be available , but said it would go on sale ' early next year			1
' a ' source close to @entity1 ' told the information last month that the firm ' would be lucky to ship [ the watch ] before @entity34 '			2
@entity18 falls on 19 february next year , so ms @entity36 comments push it at least beyond this date			0
despite the range of impressive features unveiled by mr @entity24 , there was something he failed to mention : battery life			1
the telling omission suggests the watch ’s battery life will be the @entity47 of the device when it eventually does go on sale			1
@entity1 is said to be unhappy with the watch 's battery life , and the long lead time before the $ 349 ( £ 216 ) product ships could mean the device will be more functional once it 's released early next year			1
most existing smartwatches on the market , such as @entity56 and @entity57 , tend to last up to a week on a single charge			0

the crown can also be pressed to take the user back to the home screen			0
different areas on the watch face can be customised with taps and swipes , and force touches			0
the @entity83 feature shows info users would like to see , similar to @entity85 , and is accessed by swiping the screen up from the bottom			0
music can also be controlled on an @entity67 through the @entity69			0

it understands questions in messages and then offers pre-selected answers , and messages can be dictated to the @entity67			0
users can also talk to the watch and send a voice reply , or have it transcribed to them			0
there is no keyboard on the watch , and messages can only be sent through dictation , or emoji			0
@entity109 also is built into the @entity69			0
the closest @entity24 came to talking about the battery life for the watch was saying that users would ‘ charge it at night			1
’ during an interview in @entity116 , @entity1 's senior vice president of operations @entity114 said : ' we want to make the best product in the world			2
' one of our competitors is on their fourth or fifth attempt , but nobody is wearing them			0
' the company 's chief executive added that the @entity69 ‘ can be worn all day , for any occasion , ’ but hourly figures were notably absent			2
a source said @entity1 is unhappy with the watch 's battery life , according to @entity131			1
another source confirmed to the technology site that that the battery life ‘ is about a day now			2
’ @entity1 's chief executive @entity24 ( pictured ) unveiled the watch at a launch event in september			1
although he did n't reveal battery life details , mr @entity24 did spend some time talking about the watch 's charging system , which combines @entity1 ’s magsafe technology with inductive charging the watch has a completely new user interface ( left ) , different from the @entity67 , and the ' crown ' on the @entity69 is a dial called the ' digital crown ' ( right ) presented by chief executive @entity24 the company 's chief executive added the @entity69 ‘ can be worn all day , for any occasion , ’ but hourly figures were notably absent			1
the long lead time before the $ 349 ( £ 216 ) product ships could mean the device will be more functional once it 's released early next year a spokesperson for @entity1 declined to provide battery details to @entity154 and said they will be revealed closer to launch next year			1
like many of @entity1 ’s other products , the @entity69 appears to have a sealed back , which means the battery can not be replaced			1
this suggests that the entire $ 349 ( £ 216 ) device will have to be replaced , once the battery eventually deteriorates from constant charging and use			1
another concern is the launch of the health and activity - tracking apps on the @entity69 , which will rely on adequate battery life for round - the - clock monitoring			1
companies including @entity171 and @entity172 have health trackers that are designed to be worn at night too , monitoring sleep patterns through movements			0
however , if the watch has to be charged at night , vital health signs could be missed companies including @entity171 and @entity172 have health trackers that are designed to be worn at night too , monitoring sleep patterns through movements			0

@entity1 ’s silence on battery life suggests the company is still working to improve the feature			2
the success of the device could hang on whether or not it manages to do it in time .			0
