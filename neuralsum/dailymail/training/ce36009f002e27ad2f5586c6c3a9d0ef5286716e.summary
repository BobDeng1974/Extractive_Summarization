@entity2 's @entity1 career took another turn for the worse on tuesday night as the £ 15million forward was an unused substitute as @entity6 's side crashed out of the @entity7 with a humiliating 4 - 0 defeat against @entity9			1
the 21 - year - old , who is still yet to start a @entity11 for @entity1 since arriving from @entity12 in january 2013 , was a noticeable inclusion on the bench at stadium : mk but failed to get any minutes on the pitch as @entity19 opted for other alternatives			1
@entity21 would n't have made the greatest first impression on the new @entity1 boss earlier this summer as he opted not to turn up to an ' optional ' training session on the third day of pre-season - attended by every other available squad member			1
@entity21 , who earlier this week was sanctioned for speeding in his £ 188,000 @entity46 in @entity47 , withdrew from the last @entity49 squad in may due to a minor injury			2
and @entity39 has insisted that attitude and application is key if players such as the @entity1 forward want to make it to the top			2
out of favour : @entity21 has yet to start a @entity11 game for the @entity58 since joining over a year ago key asset : @entity21 celebrates play - off success at @entity61 with former side @entity12 in 2013 he said earlier this week : ' the door will always be open for lads to work their way back in			1
' but we want to be world champions and to get there it is going to take a certain mindset			0
we have a group of players who have that mindset			0
' the likes of former side @entity12 , @entity74 and @entity75 have all been mooted as possible destinations for the wide - man to go out on loan as he looks to get his career back on track , with high - flying championship side @entity81 also linked with the former @entity32 loanee			0

@entity85 blames injuries , errors and luck			0

@entity21 was an unused sub as @entity1 crashed out of the @entity7
the 21 - year - old is well out of favour under @entity6 at @entity35
@entity21 is set to miss out on a spot in @entity38 's latest under - 21 squad
