@entity0 was always sipping bottled water in an effort to drink the recommended eight glasses a day like many women , @entity0 was always sipping bottled water in an effort to drink the recommended eight glasses a day			1
as a consultant in the oil and gas industry , who travels around the world , she kept a bottle in her handbag to drink on the move			0
‘ it ’s common knowledge that drinking water is fundamental in maintaining health , ’ she says			0
but despite her best efforts to stay healthy , she was baffled when she began to suffer from a range of symptoms			0
‘ i felt bloated and wiped out , no matter how much sleep i got , ’ says @entity22 , 37 , from @entity23			1
‘ i tried cutting out bread and exercised more in a bid to boost my metabolism and snap me out of it , but i still felt terrible			2
i had odd symptoms that would flare up and subside without warning — muscle aches , joint pain , dizziness , palpitations , nausea			0
’ for three years , she consulted endocrinologists , neurologists , gastroenterologists , rheumatologists and immunologists			2
every expert offered different solutions to the symptoms — but none could explain what was actually wrong			0
‘ it was n’t until i saw naturopathic doctor @entity47 that i got any answers , ’ says @entity22			0
‘ after a battery of tests , she identified i had a magnesium deficiency			1
’ surprisingly , some think drinking bottled water may be a contributing factor			0
this little - heard - of deficiency is surprisingly common among women — one survey found one in ten suffers from it , but some experts cite figures as high as seven in ten — and the effects can be devastating			1
from maintaining energy levels to steadying heart rhythm , regulating blood pressure and keeping bones strong , magnesium is vital for the body			2
and , disastrously , modern diets are not just lacking in magnesium — they actively deplete it			2
the recommended daily intake for adults is 420mg for men and 320mg for women			1
once this would have been easy to get from a mix of wholegrains , green leafy vegetables , nuts and meat			0
magnesium is the second most abundant metal in seawater — only salt is more abundant but intensive farming has seen the magnesium content in vegetables decline by as much as 80 per cent since 1950			2
caffeine , alcohol , processed grains and sugar prompt the kidneys to expel magnesium , depleting already low levels still further			2
moreover , many of us have swapped a significant source of magnesium — tap water — for bottled water , which often has a far lower content			2
modern lifestyles are also at fault			0
stress can be a cause and a symptom of magnesium deficiency			1
the stress hormones adrenaline and cortisol , released in ‘ fight or flight ’ situations , deplete the body ’s natural stores			0
but as magnesium helps to regulate blood pressure and heart rhythm , a deficiency may mean stress is tougher to handle			1
dr @entity138 uses magnesium to treat migraines as it has a relaxing and calming effect on the body these low magnesium levels are difficult to diagnose			1
a blood test rarely helps as just 1 per cent of the body ’s magnesium stores are found in blood			2
the rest is in our bones and muscles			0
worse still , typical symptoms of magnesium deficiency — pain , fatigue , insomnia and muscle cramps — are common to many other conditions so doctors may wrongly diagnose anything from irritable bowel syndrome and pre-menstrual tension to migraine and fibromyalgia			1
in @entity167 , magnesium is offered to patients suffering from @entity169 , stress or fatigue			2
nutritional therapist dr @entity138 says : ‘ magnesium has n’t had much publicity — the food industry does n’t use it to promote its products as it does with calcium			1
magnesium deficiency is hard to diagnose , so many people do n’t know they have it			1
’ @entity0 , 37 , from @entity23 , consulted endocrinologists , neurologists , gastroenterologists , rheumatologists and immunologists about her fatigue ironically , calcium is useless without magnesium , which is why a deficiency is implicated in osteoporosis			1
so experts argue that many typical manifestations of ageing — loss of muscle mass , rising blood pressure and diminished nervous system function — are because the body ’s ability to metabolise magnesium may decrease with age			2
dr @entity138 uses magnesium to treat migraines as it has a relaxing and calming effect on the body			1
a @entity206 study found a 41.6 per cent drop in migraine frequency among sufferers who were given a supplement , and it can also treat asthma by suppressing histamine production			0
but many medications can cause a magnesium deficiency , as @entity216 discovered			1
the 60 - year - old retired consultant from @entity218 suffered from acid reflux for years , controlling it with over-the - counter remedies			1
but when her discomfort worsened , her gp prescribed omeprazole tablets , a type of medicine known as a proton - pump inhibitor , which have been found to inhibit magnesium absorption when used long - term			2
although they eased the heartburn , after 18 months she had an unusual side - effect			0
‘ i had a strange sensation down my left side , ’ says @entity216			1
‘ over months , it developed from a kind of fluttering into a spasm , as if an unborn baby was kicking me			0
’ @entity216 ’s gp was baffled			1
‘ all his tests were inconclusive , which worried me even more , ’ she says			0
‘ all sorts of horrible illnesses came into my mind , including cancer			0
’ her husband , @entity246 , did some internet research and within 15 minutes he had found a cause			0
‘ he told me lots of people were complaining on forums of the same symptoms and that they turned out to have magnesium deficiency , ’ says @entity216			1
‘ he told me beetroot contains magnesium , and we had a ready supply on the allotment			0
‘ we started eating it in salads , soups , everything			0
within a couple of days , the pain stopped , just like that			0
’ @entity216 told her gp about her self - diagnosis and treatment			1
‘ he said he ’d just been reading new research about magnesium deficiency , so clearly doctors are catching on to it at last , ’ she says			1
‘ i had no idea just how vital it was to our bodies			0
it ’s incredible to think i lived with these symptoms for so long and yet the remedy was so simple			0
’ in fact , digestive conditions such as acid reflux are often related to magnesium deficiency , and medications can make the problem even worse			1
@entity216 ’s @entity265 switched her to another indigestion remedy , @entity285 , and the discomfort never recurred			1
but when her heartburn worsened a year ago and the doctor prescribed a stronger medication called @entity290 , @entity216 added a magnesium supplement to her diet , as well as upping her intake of beetroot and other magnesium - rich food			1
‘ it is common for people suffering from digestive problems to have a magnesium deficiency , ’ says dr @entity138			1
‘ if your digestive system is n’t working properly , the acids in your stomach will not break down food , preventing the absorption of vital nutrients			0
’ for @entity22 , help came in the form of an intravenous vitamin cocktail , including magnesium , prescribed by dr @entity313			1
‘ within days , i could feel a significant improvement as my symptoms started to fade away and became more manageable , ’ she says			0
‘ i began eating magnesium - rich foods , such as pumpkin seeds , sesame seeds and avocados			0
‘ dr @entity313 also explained that i needed supplements to support my adrenal gland because poor adrenal function encourages the body to expel high levels of magnesium as waste			2
‘ no one ever talks about magnesium , so i had no idea i needed it in my diet — let alone that being deficient could have such a dramatic impact on my life			0
