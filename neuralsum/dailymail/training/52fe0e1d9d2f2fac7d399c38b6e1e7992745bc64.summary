@entity6 , who owns @entity7 in @entity8 , 26km north of @entity5 , told @entity9 that he had been attaching a sign to the tow bar of his car for the last seven and a half years			1
' the sign slides into my tow bar , only when i 'm at work , and has an arrow pointing to the restaurant , ' @entity6 was advised by his local council to remove the pictured sign or risk receiving a fine due to not holding a permit			1
however the council said they did not issue permits or direct him to somewhere that did ' i 'm under a motel so you could drive right past without even noticing me			2
' despite the fact that mr @entity6 has been displaying the sign since june 10 in 2008 , he said he was approached by a ranger from the @entity32 who told him he had to take it down			2
' we 're at a dead end , ' a confused mr @entity6 , who had been displaying the sign since june 10 in 2008 , said ' she said : " if you do n't take it off i 'm going to have to give you a warning and you 'll get a fine " , ' mr @entity6 said			2
' she said it 's against the law and i need a permit for the sign , but they do n't issue permits			1
' mr @entity6 then contacted the @entity48 and the local police about where he could obtain a permit for the ad , both of which referred him back to his local council			1
