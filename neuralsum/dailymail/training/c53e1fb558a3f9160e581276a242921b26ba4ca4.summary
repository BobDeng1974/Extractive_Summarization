her story is as remarkable as it is revolutionary			0
and it 's ironic to think that , in a low - income housing block in @entity4 - an area of @entity6 hardly known for its safety - the most dangerous person inside is arguably an 85 - year - old @entity11 grandmother			1
dr @entity12 - a gynecologist , author and affirmed human rights warrior - has been living in exile in @entity17 since 2009 for her tireless commitment to a crisis in @entity11 that has seen her almost universally renowned as ' the @entity21 granny '			1
dr @entity12 , who can not return to her country out of fear of being jailed for ' inciting subversion ' , has spent close to 20 years attempting to expose an aids epidemic borne out of a corrupt blood - selling scandal			1
the indefatigable octogenarian went against the @entity11 government to challenge official figures about the extent at which @entity21 was decimating whole towns and and how it came to be the country 's leading cause of death among infectious diseases			1
@entity11 's first @entity21 activist : dr @entity12 , who is living in exile in @entity39 out of fear being imprisoned in @entity11 , has not stopped her campaign against a blood - selling scandal in her country for almost 20 years			1
she maintains that most of the people suffering from @entity21 in @entity11 contracted it through donating blood dr @entity12 , an 85 - year - old gynecologist , works away in her tiny one - bedroom apartment in @entity4 , writing towards her 27th book exposing @entity11 's aids plague dr @entity12 helps treat an unnamed @entity21 victim in @entity11 while officials continued to preach that @entity51 was contracted through sexual transmission and drug use , dr @entity12 garnered a cache of evidence to show the infections actually came through blood donations , according to @entity58			1
she claims up to 10 million people , mostly in rural areas , could have been contaminated by either donating or receiving blood via transfusion as part of a ruthless money - making machine known as the ' plasma economy '			1
because of @entity11 's susceptibility to natural disaster and disease , the need for blood is paramount and extremely profitable			1
fearing the @entity21 crisis in 1985 , just as doctors of the world began to understand @entity51 was transferred via blood , @entity11 banned imports of foreign blood products under the misguided belief all their citizens were disease - free			1
in 1991 , the government - backed a campaign as part of this ' plasma economy ' , encouraging farmers to sell their blood , marketing it as both an ' honor ' to the people and an easy way to make money			1
the poorest of people especially jumped aboard , with hundreds of licensed blood and plasma banks popping up in provinces and thousands more illegal ones			2
the process was sped up by reusing needles and pooling the blood together , meaning the stations were unknowingly transferring @entity51 - tainted cells to people both when taking blood from donors and when transfusing it to those in need			1
it 's the information of this scandal and her role in making it public that caused dr @entity12 to feel endangered and flee @entity11 four years ago			1
she says she left with nothing but blood - pressure medication in one hand and a usb stick filled with her findings in the other			0
' i am in my eighties , ' she told the pulse			0
' i do n't care about my life			0
' but i do do care about the evidence concerning the @entity21 plague in @entity11			2
' my priority now is not to go back to @entity11			0
' the most important thing is to leave the evidence , the material , for posterity			0
' otherwise no one will know the truth			0
' she is almost 86 , but dr @entity12 is about to publish her 27th book on the cause of @entity11 's long - denied @entity21 plague dr @entity12 's @entity21 crusade began in 1996			1
she was retired at the time after already living through a lifetime of turmoil during @entity142 's @entity141			0
a married mother - of - three , she was taken as a political prisoner for being an educated woman and spent over a year in a labor camp			2
once being reunited with her family , she was working as a doctor during the shocking one - child policy , at which point no living babies were allowed to leave hospital			0
her job was mostly centered around late - term abortions , some at full - term , before she stopping working			0
but dr @entity12 was brought out of retirement to consult on a strange case - a 42 - year - old woman , ms @entity159 , had undergone ovarian surgery but had not recovered after the operation			1
instead she had become more ill , with fevers , a bloated stomach and lesions			0
when an aids test she ordered came back positive , dr @entity12 was perplexed			1
how could a simple farmer - whose husband and child had clean blood , and who was not a drug user or prostitute - have @entity21 ? dr @entity12 's quest to help the people of @entity11 who had contracted @entity21 started in 1996 with just one patient , ms. @entity159 , whose file seemed to be the complete opposite of what the government defined as a typical @entity21 sufferer there were only a few confirmed @entity21 cases in @entity11 at the time			1
dr @entity12 determined the source was a government blood bank — ms. @entity159 ’s post-surgical blood transfusion had infected her with @entity51			1
ms. @entity159 died within two weeks			0
' i realized the seriousness of the problem , ' dr @entity12 later wrote			2
' if the blood in the blood bank carried the @entity21 virus , then these victims would not be a small number			2
' over months and years , dr @entity12 's research into the epidemic took her across much of rural @entity11 , where she discovered villages with infection rates of 20 , 30 , 40 % or more , as well as whole communities of @entity21 orphans			1
there no treatment options and no education about the sickness that was killing off generations of people			0
so dr @entity12 began making public lectures and circulating pamphlets she 'd had printed to increase @entity21 awareness			1
she was also giving out her own money to @entity21 victims , hence the nickname ' the @entity21 granny '			2
for years dr @entity12 moved around rural @entity11 , applying medicine to people who suffered from @entity21 and gathering information on what had caused such a widespread outbreak			1
she would even hand out her own money her charity exposed the local governments who were n't doing their jobs properly , as well as a government that were covering up the truth of what was happening to their people			2
she began being followed and maintains that her phone was tapped for years			0
in one particular @entity21 village , dr @entity12 learned the mayor had put a 500 yuan ( $ 82 ) bounty on her head , with any villager who caught her entitled to the money			1
but she was their savior			0
' they did n’t even try to catch me - they did n’t want to turn me in , ' dr @entity12 said			1
dr @entity12 recalls one story about two boys who were best friends , one with @entity51 and the other healthy			1
one day they were fighting , causing both to start bleeding and their blood to mix. ' they both died of @entity21 , ' she said , fighting back tears			2
only in 2008 did @entity11 acknowledge that @entity21 is the leading cause of death among infectious diseases			2
in 2011 , a joint @entity247 – @entity11 government report estimated 780,000 people in @entity11 are living with @entity51			2
the report said just 6.6 % of them were infected through the plasma trade			0
the real numbers are subject to debate and almost certainly higher , say global health experts			0
as dr @entity12 's profile increased , further incensing government officials , and following the arrests of other humanitarians doing similar work , she realized she would have to leave @entity11 it was in 2007 that dr @entity12 realized she had to leave @entity11 , especially after the arrests of other humanitarians doing similar work , one of which had been jailed for 11 years			1
' i needed to leave to protect my children and my family , ' she said			0
she had been invited to @entity267 to receive an award from the @entity269 , a group co-chaired by then - sen. @entity270			0
but local officials put her under house arrest to stop dr @entity12 from going			2
according to cables released by @entity274 from the then - @entity267 ambassador to @entity11 , vice premier @entity276 — the highest - ranking woman to ever serve in @entity11 ’s @entity279 government — intervened personally to force officials to allow dr @entity12 to travel to the @entity267 to accept the award			1
she returned afterwards , but fled permanently in 2009			0
dr @entity12 has refused to discuss exactly how she managed to get out of the country , so as to protect the people who helped her			2
however she managed to fly to @entity6 from the southern city of @entity284 shortly after the death of her husband			0
dr @entity12 spends her days writing and is about to publish her 27th book			1
she says the government continues to deny the @entity21 epidemic			2
in may 2012 , the government ordered families to demolish and clear millions of tombs set across four counties that had been used to bury the dead , in an obvious attempt to hide evidence			0
a farmer walks though a @entity11 town that came to be known as an ' @entity299 ' , with mass graves seen in the background ' i want to stop , but i can not , ' she said			0
' i am too old			0
' i feel powerless to all things			0
' the purpose of writing these books is to ask for justice for the victims and leave it for the later generations to judge			0
' it is also a mental comfort for me			0

dr @entity12 , a gynecologist in @entity11 , was brought out of retirement in 1996 to treat a young mother who had undergone ovarian surgery but become more ill after the operation
an *investigation* by dr @entity12 proved the woman had contracted @entity21 from a government - run blood blank that was *paying* poor people to donate plasma without screening the samples for aids
the octogenarian *endeavored* to publicize the operation she believed had infected up to 10 million people with @entity51 , either through *re-using* needles or pooling the blood together before giving transfusions to those in need
the crusade put her in danger from a government that was covering up the epidemic and , in 2009 , she *secretly* fled @entity11 for @entity6
dr @entity12 is now about to publish her 27th book on @entity11 's @entity21 crisis
