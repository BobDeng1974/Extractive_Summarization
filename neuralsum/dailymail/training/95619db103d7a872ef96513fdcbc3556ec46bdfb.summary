' @entity5 's brother @entity13 told the inquest : ' she was a happy young woman who enjoyed her work and social life			1
she kept everything very close to herself			0
' assistant @entity21 coroner @entity81 said ms @entity5 's family was ' most loving ' and ' really cared for her ' he said there was no indication that she was unhappy the evening before she died			1
he added : ' as a teenager she was always conscious of her skin condition and it worried her greatly			1
' @entity5 's neighbour @entity89 found a note from her on the morning of friday , may 23 asking her to call the emergency services so @entity5 's family would not find her body			1

she attended with depression and anxiety towards the end of 2013 and again this year			1
' in may she said she was finding things overwhelming but did not mention any particular trigger			0
' the skin condition — characterised by raised flaking , itching red patches on various parts of the body — affects around 1.8 million people in @entity160 , most of them first affected before their 40th birthday			1
it is an immune condition that causes the body to produce too many new skin cells			1
the extra cells accumulate and cluster in red , inflamed patches , thickening the skin , which often has a ‘ silvery scale ’ appearance			2
a virus or infection such as tonsillitis — when the immune system is weakened — can trigger the condition in those with a genetic predisposition , as can a stressful event			2
around 30 per cent of people with psoriasis get painful joints — sometimes the joint pain comes before the skin condition appears — because the immune system targets the joints , triggering psoriatic arthritis			1
the severity of the condition varies from person to person , for some causing a minor irritation , while for others it has a major impact on their quality of life			2
the condition is not contagious , so can not be spread from person to person			2
there is no cure for psoriasis , but a range of treatments can be used to improve symptoms and the appearance of the affected skin patches			1
in most cases a sufferer will be prescribed creams and ointments to ease the symptoms			2
the doctor gave her sertraline , an anti-depressant drug , but a fortnight later @entity5 's mood had worsened and she went back			1
' she may have had to wait longer to see the benefits of the drug , ' said dr @entity144			0
' there is n't a drug to give more immediate relief			0
' assistant @entity21 coroner @entity81 said : ' she was a young lady who has achieved well in just about everything she has done			0
' although suffering from psoriasis and bouts of anxiety and depression she was ' happy and active ' until her mood began to change towards the end of 2013			1
' she had the most loving of families - a family that really cared for her , ' said the coroner			2
' they were aware of some of the problems but never the full extent thereafter not because of any fault on their part because @entity5 did not reveal the full extent of the depression she suffered at times			1
' she never told her family , doctors or friends about her suicide plans			0
' during the spring of 2014 her mood was at all times lower than that recognised by anyone , ' said the coroner			0
' that 's not to criticise her family or health services			0
it may be down in part to the fact that she cared for so many people she did n't want them to believe she had a very low mood and did n't want to distress them			2
' he said her death involved planning ' which she kept from everyone			0
' recording a suicide verdict he extended his sympathies to the family and said : ' she had been successful and had a good future ahead of her			0
