@entity1 batsman dies aged 25 two days after being hit on the head by a bouncer @entity4 : @entity5 will take stock after @entity8 ' death , do everything it can , but ultimately it will carry on			1
it has to ... @entity10 : the @entity8 accident is tragic and my heart goes out to @entity14 @entity16 's obituary @entity17 believes the game of cricket has never been safer , despite the death of @entity8 on thursday at the age of 25			1
@entity8 died two days after being struck on the head by a bouncer while batting for @entity24 against @entity25 but @entity17 , who played with the @entity1 at @entity27 , said a player no longer went out to bat ' worrying that his life might be on the line ' and urged the powers that be not to consider banning short deliveries			1
the former @entity35 captain admitted the natural response to such a tragedy was to assume ' massive changes ' were needed , but said on @entity39 : ' the protection in the game of cricket has never been better than it is today			1
@entity17 thinks the game of cricket has never been safer despite the death of @entity8 ' i do n't think any cricketer will go out there to bat these days worrying that his life might be on the line			1
i think in the old days , pre-helmet , that did used to take place quite often , these days it does n't happen			2
' i think it 's really important we investigate this fully and see what can be done			0
i would hate to see a situation where bowlers ca n't bowl short balls			1
' that is the element of bat versus ball and there has got to be a little bit of an element of , not fear , but , as a batsman , you have to protect yourself and if you lose that i think it shifts the balance between bat and ball too firmly in the favour of the batsman			2
' let 's look if we can do anything more on the protection side			0
i do n't know the full details of it , it sounds like he got hit on the neck , which is not usually a particularly dangerous place to get hit			2
' i 've been hit on the neck a number of times , i can remember twice by @entity85 in the same test match , so whether this is just one of those freak , tragic accidents or not remains to be seen			1
' @entity8 died on thursday afternoon , two days after being hit on the head by a bouncer in @entity92 the @entity1 batsman was taken to hospital in @entity92 after being hit by a delivery from @entity14 another former @entity35 skipper @entity96 said @entity8 ' death would ' shake ' batsmen into recognising the importance of safety			1
he said : ' it 's an incredibly safe game but i think this will shake batsmen slightly out of what might have been complacency			2
' i wore the same helmet for 10 years			0
i did n't give it much thought really			2
if there is that kind of complacency that i was guilty of , then i think people will be shaken out of that			0
' i 'll be making sure my 12 - year - old boy 's helmet is up to scratch and the latest model			0
but fundamentally , it 's a safe game with risk attached			0
' the @entity1 flag was raised at half - mast at the @entity123 after @entity8 ' death @entity4 added : ' you have to think about ways of improving the helmet all the time , balancing protection with being able to move and see the ball			1
' putting bits on the neck ... is an area we 've never thought about			0
we were always told to protect the temple but were never really concerned about the neck			0
' the instinct to get out of the way of a bouncer is to turn away - this will send shock waves through every cricketer			0
' @entity142 , who played alongside @entity8 with @entity27 in 2009 , said : ' unfortunately the ball missed his helmet - if it had hit it he might still be with us			1
' this highlights the need to keep progressing and moving forward			0
in the helmet industry this is being done			0
