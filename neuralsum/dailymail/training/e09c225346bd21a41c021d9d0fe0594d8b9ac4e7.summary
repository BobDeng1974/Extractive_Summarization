a @entity1 flu vaccine to protect against new strains of the bird and swine flu may be a step closer thanks to @entity8 research			1
for decades the key to creating a vaccine to protect against all forms of flu has eluded scientists			0
current vaccines only target the most common strains by making the immune system produce antibodies to prevent infection			1
a @entity1 flu vaccine to protect against new strains of the bird and swine flu may be a step closer thanks to @entity8 research but they remain one step behind the virus , which keeps evolving			1
however , thanks to a study carried out during the 2009 swine flu outbreak , the annual flu season could be reduced and future pandemics prevented			1
scientists at @entity31 used the outbreak as a ‘ unique ’ natural experiment to investigate why some people got sick while others did not			1
hundreds of staff and students donated blood samples as the pandemic took off and were then monitored over the next two flu seasons			0
those who did not get sick had more virus - killing immune cells , known as @entity46 cells , in their blood at the start of the pandemic , the study found			2
a new vaccine would work by prompting the body to produce these cells to fend off the virus			0
professor @entity54 from the @entity55 said the discovery has provided the ‘ blueprint ’ for a vaccine , adding : ' new strains of flu are continuously emerging , some of which are deadly , and so the holy grail is to create a universal vaccine that would be effective against all strains of flu			2
@entity67 kills between 250,000 and 500,000 globally per year , according to the @entity68			0
the @entity31 announcement comes after scientists in @entity71 said they thought they might have developed ' universal ' protection against the killer virus			2
current vaccines only target the most common strains by making the immune system produce antibodies to prevent infection speaking in may , the @entity71 researchers said the vaccine was created by a team working for @entity71 healthcare company @entity82 using techniques that have also raised hopes of a new generation of vaccines against other diseases			1
prof @entity54 's team recruited 342 staff and students at @entity31 to take part in their study in autumn 2009 , following the outbreak of the flu			1
volunteers donated blood samples and were given nasal swabs , supplying regular updated information about their health			0
researchers found those who fell more severely ill with flu had fewer @entity46 cells in their blood , and those who caught flu but had no symptoms or only mild symptoms had more of these cells			0
prof @entity54 said : ' our findings suggest that by making the body produce more of this specific type of @entity115 , you can protect people against symptomatic illness			0
this provides the blueprint for developing a universal flu vaccine			0
' we already know how to stimulate the immune system to make @entity123 t cells by vaccination			2
' now that we know these t cells may protect , we can design a vaccine to prevent people getting symptoms and transmitting infection to others			0
' this could curb seasonal flu annually and protect people against future pandemics			1
