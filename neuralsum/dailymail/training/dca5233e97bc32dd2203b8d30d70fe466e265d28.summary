by @entity0 published : 05:21 est , 22 june 2013 updated : 09:44 est , 22 june 2013 terminally ill people should turn to @entity2 and @entity3 instead of @entity4 to take their minds off death , according to a retired minister			2
the @entity8 says the dying should read bodice - rippers and bonkbusters rather than the @entity12 to resurrect ' joyful , rude memories ' in their final days			1
the retired @entity15 minister , best known for founding the @entity16 , makes his recommendations in @entity18 , a pamphlet about preparing for death			1
the novels of @entity2 , left , and @entity3 , right , could help the terminally - ill take their minds off death he suggests that the @entity12 's talk of sin , judgment and eternal damnation could be unsettling for those living with a terminal illness and recommends reliving romantic highs instead			1
mr @entity8 said : ' when people are told they are dying reading the @entity12 might be the last thing they want to do			2
' but they should n't be afraid to read a rude or lively book ... something a bit saucy			0
' the subject of death is still a bit taboo , like sex used to be , so why not ? ' it might trigger some happy , joyful , rude memories			1
' a book like @entity3 's riders could trigger ' happy , joyful , rude memories ' , says the @entity8 racy novels , which could include @entity2 's chances or @entity3 's riders , could cheer the soul , he said			1
mr @entity8 , who used to celebrate mass at the @entity52 in @entity53 - under - @entity54 , @entity55 , was inspired to write the pamphlet after he was approached by a terminally - ill stranger			1
the man had three months to live and wanted mr @entity8 to conduct his funeral			2
the retired minister told the @entity61 : ' i had thought about airing some of the material in my brochure before , but that chance meeting triggered me off			0
' i have been approached by people to take their funerals several times , usually because they want it done by someone who knows about them , but this was a stranger			0
' the man was obviously in distress because he had just been told about his condition and was trying to prepare for his demise			0
i have spoken to him a few times since and we have been over some of the things included in the brochure but i have nâ€™t asked him what he thinks			0
' mr @entity8 founded the @entity16 , which later became the @entity84 , in the mid- 1980s to promote good manners			2
the campaign counts @entity87 and @entity88 among its patrons			0
he later had a @entity91 - on - @entity92 pub , the @entity90 , named after him .			0
