by @entity0 scientists have used the remains of ancient chickens to prove that @entity4 beat the @entity5 to discovering @entity6			1
the study of ancient and modern chickens has dismissed a previous study of chicken bones which had claimed that @entity5 voyagers reaching @entity6 before @entity12 explorers			1
the @entity14 's @entity13 for @entity15 led an international team who looked again at bones from modern and ancient chickens - and believe it proves once and for all that @entity4 did reach @entity6 first			1
the study ends the dispute which had claimed @entity5 voyagers reached @entity6 before @entity12 explorers			2
the new study reveals that previous studies were probably based on contaminated results			1
the results showed that the chicken dna had a distinct genetic marker that is not found in modern @entity6 chickens , which suggests that the @entity5 and @entity6 people did not have much contact			1
the research team used dna extracted from modern chicken feathers and bones excavated from archaeological sites from islands including @entity38 , @entity39 ( @entity39 ) and @entity40			1
many of the modern samples used were collected as part of a sailing expedition from the @entity45 to the islands of @entity47 and @entity48 in @entity49 made by two replica @entity5 catamarans back in 2009			2
professor @entity52 , an @entity53 and co-author on the paper , joined the expedition sailing through the @entity57 and collecting hair and feather samples from domestic animals from remote island locations			0
professor @entity52 said ' these modern chicken samples proved crucial to the study , helping us to identify and track the unique genetic signatures of original @entity5 chickens across the @entity68 and revealing their origins in the @entity45			1
' our research at @entity53 , with colleagues from across the world , involves studying a range of domestic and invasive animals that were moved by people in the past			0
' we 're using a range of techniques ( including @entity15 ) to test theories about where early human colonists of the remote @entity68 came from , which routes they followed and whether they ever voyaged as far as the @entity6 mainland			0
' illustration of @entity4 and his men arriving on the @entity86			0
it has been claimed @entity5 explorers had beat him there - until today			0
project leader professor @entity90 , director of @entity91 said : ' we were able to re-examine bones used in previous studies that had linked ancient @entity68 and @entity6 chickens , suggesting early human contact , and found that some of the results were contaminated with modern chicken dna , which occurs at trace levels in many laboratory components			1
' we were able to show that the ancient chicken dna provided no evidence of any @entity104 contact between these areas			2
' remarkably , our study also shows that the original @entity5 lineages appear to have survived on some isolated @entity68 islands , despite the introduction of @entity12 domestic animals across the @entity68 in the last couple of hundred years , ' professor @entity90 says			2
' these original lineages could be of considerable importance to the poultry industry which is concerned about the lack of genetic diversity in commercial stocks			0
' associate professor @entity119 , @entity91 deputy director , said : ' there are still many theories about where the early human colonists of the remote @entity68 came from , which routes they followed and whether they made contact with the @entity6 mainland			0
' domestic animals , such as chickens , carried on these early voyages have left behind a genetic record that can solve some of these long standing mysteries .			0

new study reveals previous claims that @entity5 found the @entity134 are *flawed*
