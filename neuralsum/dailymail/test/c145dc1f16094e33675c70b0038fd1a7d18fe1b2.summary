they already have a fearsome reputation as the top predator of their time , but it seems the @entity5 were also prone to eating each other			0
a new study has uncovered evidence that a relative of @entity10 , called @entity11 , may have indulged in cannibalism			1
paleontologists have found bite marks on the fossilised skull of a juvenile @entity11 , which lived around 75 million years ago			1
this artist 's reconstruction shows a @entity11 feeding on the body of another in an act of cannibalism while some of the injuries appear to have been sustained during combat with other tyrannosaurs , others appear to have occurred after death			1
the scientists believe that another @entity11 , which could grow to nine metres ( 30ft ) as adults and weigh up to four tons , fed on the youngster 's body			1
@entity10 and its relatives were more intelligent than previously thought and hunted in gangs which included young and older members , researchers have claimed			2
scientists believe they have evidence that the top predatory dinosaurs were highly intelligent pack animals , despite @entity10 being popularly depicted as a dangerous but dim - witted loner			1
this is a myth that has grown up because for many years their fossil skeletons tended to be found on their own , researchers say			0
the new theory follows an analysis of skeletons of the tyrannosaur @entity51 from 90 sites in the @entity53 , @entity54			0
@entity51 , a cousin of @entity10 that lived around 70 million years ago , was a two - legged predator up to 12 metres long and weighing five tonnes			1
at least half a dozen of the animals appear to have belonged to a single social group , including adults and juveniles , that died together			0
the findings help to shed light on the brutal world in which the dinosaurs inhabited			0
dr @entity66 , a paleontologist at @entity67 , who led the research said : ' this animal clearly had a tough life , suffering numerous injuries across the head including some that must have been quite nasty			0
' the most likely candidate to have done this is another member of the same species , suggesting some serious fights between these animals during their lives			0
' the researchers , whose work is published in the journal @entity84 , were examining the skull of a @entity11 found in a quarry in the @entity87 close to @entity88 , @entity89 in @entity90 in 1994			1
@entity11 , which means ' frightful lizard ' , is thought to be a close relative of the more famous @entity10 and roamed @entity94 between 77 million and 74 million years ago			1
with a massive , heavy skull that could be more than 3ft ( 1 metre ) in length , it would have had a powerful bite and probably preyed on large armoured ceratopsid dinosaurs			2
the dinosaur latest study was thought to be a juvenile , measuring just under 19.7 feet ( 6 metres ) and weighed around half a tonne			0
the researchers found numerous injuries on the skull , several of which appeared to match the teeth of tyrannosaurs			1
the skull of the juvenile @entity11 ( above ) was covered in bite marks made by @entity5 teeth @entity66 ( left ) and @entity113 ( right ) studied the fossilised skull at the @entity115 one bite to the back of the head broke off part of the skull and left a circular tooth - shaped puncture through the bone			1
however , there are signs the bone had begun healing , suggesting the injury was not fatal and that the animal lived for some time after it was inflicted			0
while the researchers can not say what killed the @entity11 , damage on the jaw bones suggest that a large tyrannosaur bit into the dead creature between one and three times in what appears to be feeding behaviour			2
@entity11 is thought to have not just hunted but also scavenged for food and the research team say the injuries appear to have occurred after it had begun to decay			2
cannibalism is relatively common in the natural world , with more than 1,000 species known to eat their own species			0
the fossilised skull of @entity11 was found in a quarry in @entity87 in @entity89 , @entity90 @entity11 , shown in the artists reconstruction above , led a violent life the study suggests @entity10 is also thought to have indulged in cannibalism , according to a study in 2010			1
writing in the journal , dr @entity66 and his colleague @entity113 from the @entity115 in @entity155 , @entity89 , said the @entity11 appeared to have lived a violent life involving battles with other members of its own species			1
they said : ' numerous wounds were inflicted during life and despite some considerable damage the animal clearly survived as shown by the evidence of healing			2
' these were likely inflicted at least in part by one or more conspecifics and perhaps as a result of numerous separate instances of conflict			0
' after death , the animal suffered at least one major bite to the right dentary , and perhaps two more from another tyrannosaurid , possibly another @entity11			2
' the specimen must have been decaying prior to the delivery of the bite to the dentary , and the condition of other material suggests scavenging , rather than simply late - stage carcass consumption			0

fossilised skull of @entity11 - a close relative of @entity10 - found to be covered in bite marks that suggest it was eaten after it had died
palaeontologists believe another @entity11 scavenged on the body
the skull was found in @entity87 in @entity89 , @entity90 , in 1994
it also carried wounds that appeared to have been inflicted during battles
