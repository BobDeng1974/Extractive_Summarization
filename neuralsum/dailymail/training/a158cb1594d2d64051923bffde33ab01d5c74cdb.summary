by @entity0 published : 03:12 est , 4 march 2014 updated : 05:16 est , 4 march 2014 deep rooted problem : historian @entity3 believes that female broadcasters must lower their voices to sound like men if they want to be successful female broadcasters are forced to ape the deeper more ' authoritative ' voices of men or be ' young and pretty ' to be successful on radio and tv , historian @entity3 has said			1
criticising the lack of women in senior positions the academic said the power at the @entity17 and elsewhere lies ' with the men in suits and their deep voices '			1
' it 's not a coincidence that even on radio , the successful women presenters tend to have unusually deep ( ie male ) voices , ' she wrote in the @entity26			1
discussing women on tv she said : ' there are still relatively few and they tend to be young and conventionally pretty			1
' the fact is that even now authority still seems to reside with the men in suits , and their deep voices ; and those are the types we still assume we ’ll see when we ’re looking for words of wisdom on tv '			1
she said that the problem was deep rooted , as ' most viewers accept , without a blink , the craggy , wrinkled faces and bald patches of male documentary presenters , as if they were the signs of mature wisdom , yet in the case of women presenters , grey hair and wrinkles often signal " past - my - use - by - date " - or at least glaring eccentricity and deficient grooming			1
' she praised the likes of former @entity17 economics editor @entity54 and @entity56 presenter @entity55 but admits they are a rarity			0
professor @entity3 also believes broadcasters must address the position of women across tv , not just on panel shows @entity63 , the @entity17 's director of television , has vowed to end all - male panel shows , saying that the absence of female guests was ' not acceptable '			1
professor @entity3 , 59 , told the @entity26 that she gave ' two hearty cheers ' to @entity63 's promise but she added : ' it 's not just about panel shows			1
' she criticised the ' niche roles for women in sitcoms ' and females being placed ' next to the main ( male ) presenter on the breakfast tv sofa '			2
successful : @entity17 presenters @entity55 , left , and @entity54 , right , were praised by @entity78 - but she said they are a rarity ' and there can be an outcry when women move into what are perceived as traditional male areas			1
remember the abuse directed at @entity87 when she dared to ' leave the netball court ' and become the first woman commentator on @entity90 , ' she said			0
promise : @entity17 director of television @entity63 has pledged to include more women on comedy panel shows professor @entity3 said that the ' underlying ' maleness ' of all these shows ' was ' more hard - wired in our culture than the presence of a few extra women is likely to solve '			0
the television classicist , who has been criticised over her appearance , added : ' already in @entity103 , almost 3,000 years ago , we find a wet - behind - the - ears teenager telling his savvy mother not to speak in public			0
' of course , the @entity108 and the @entity109 did n't have panel shows			0
but the kind of male banter and repartee that we still see in these programmes - its aggression , its ' wit ' - does go back thousands of years to ancient dialogue and debate			0
' while quotas could ' help in the short term ' , the presenter said that she dreaded ' any idea of a fixed quota of women per programme ' , saying : ' it 's likely to leave desperate producers ringing round all the women they can possibly think of to fill ' the woman 's slot '			2
' she said : ' i do n't think it would be much fun being the woman vilified in all the reviews as the one taking the quota place			0
' female comedians , including @entity139 , have in the past criticised @entity17 panel shows for being a ' male preserve '			0
her comments came after veteran broadcaster @entity143 hit back at claims by comic @entity145 that @entity146 needs to tackle the gender balance of its panellists , saying he had picked ' the wrong target '			0
under fire : shows such as @entity152 featuring @entity153 , @entity154 and @entity155 have been criticised for all - male panels criticism : @entity139 has said in the past that @entity17 's panel shows are a ' male preserve ' he defended the show 's record for inviting women guests and pointed out the proportions were much higher than those for many areas of public life			2
@entity145 turned on @entity170 's political discussion show in an interview after being asked about the recent decision to ban all - male line - ups for comedy panel shows			2
' it 's remarkable that this amount of time is spent debating women on comedy shows rather than , say , @entity146 , ' he said .			0

historian says power in tv and radio is ' with men in suits with deep voices '
' it 's not a coincidence successful women presenters tend to have unusually deep ( ie male ) voices , ' she wrote in the @entity26
many women have to be ' young and pretty ' *unlike* ' craggy , wrinkled ' men
