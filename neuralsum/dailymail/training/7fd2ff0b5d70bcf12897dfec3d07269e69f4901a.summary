' but then it became a way of helping me work things out , to make sense of the situation			1
‘ you find yourself catapulted into this whole new world where even the terminology is alien			0
you have no control , you feel powerless			0
' being in the hospital all day with @entity8 , writing the blog was the only time i could sit alone and reflect on the day and what was happening in our lives			1

‘ with the photos , for me , there are some things you just ca n’t put into words			2
‘ some were hard to take , seeing your own child like that , especially after the operation when she was so very sick			0
‘ but the response has been amazing			0
it has shown me that when things get tough people show their very best side			0
it has really restored my faith in humanity			0
' the support we have received from friends , family and strangers has been incredible			2
' if our story helps anyone else in a similar situation , especially at the beginning , i ’ll be overjoyed , ' @entity19 said			2
@entity8 was diagnosed with medulloblastoma in july 2013 , when she was four , after her parents noticed she was becoming clumsy , tripping over and bumping into things			2
they took her for a check - up with her gp and booked her in for eyesight tests , presuming her problems stemmed from poor vision			0

so far she ’s had several rounds of chemotherapy , which is due to continue until september this year			0
before her treatment , @entity8 had beautiful dark curly hair , which all began to fall out when she started her chemo			2

before her treatment @entity8 had beautiful dark curly hair , which all began to fall out when she started her chemotherapy @entity19 says the support of friends , family , and strangers to the blog has been overwhelming @entity8 is used to her mother , a passionate photographer , taking pictures of her @entity19 said that as her treatment continues , @entity8 has become more interested in her mother ’s photography			1
‘ i became a professional photographer just weeks before @entity8 was diagnosed , but i 've always loved photography and have taken loads of pictures , so she was very used to it			1
‘ at first i was careful not to show her any pictures from when she was really sick , but now she shows an interest in them			0
‘ they seem to help her make sense of what has happened to her			2
she sits and looks at one and will say “ remember when that or this happened to me ”			0
‘ i hope one day these pictures will help her understand the decisions we had to make as her parents about her treatment			0

she gave us advice about the medical processes and practical help and financial advice as well			0
' everything ’s a bit overwhelming , and we were feeling overloaded with information which we did n’t fully understand ; she was great at explaining things to us and letting us know how the whole process worked and what to expect			0
‘ the information that @entity108 provided to us was brilliant			0
there ’s a leaflet called @entity242 has a @entity243 which we read to @entity244 so he could understand what was happening to his sister			0
