@entity5 ( pictured with his wife and children ) says he will encourage his kids to work in his pub on weekends but a new study by the @entity31 at the @entity32 found teenagers who take on part - time jobs experience a slip in their gcse results			1
this is because earning extra cash makes it more likely for youngsters to spend it unwisely – including on alcohol , cigarettes and and cannabis			2
and the effect was found to be more drastic for girls			0
despite having millionaires for parents , @entity3 took on weekend shifts at a coffee shop results showed an extra hour of work per week in @entity54 saw their results drop around one grade in one subject the following year			1
the study analysed the hours these young people spent working and the impact of this on time spent on study time , other activities and their grades at gcse level			0
dr @entity66 , who wrote the report called @entity68 and @entity69 , says approximately a quarter of 13 to 16 - year - olds take on some form of formal paid employment during term time			1
‘ this can be a good thing – they earn their own money and can pick up useful skills , which might help them find full - time work in the future , ’ he said , according to @entity75			2
‘ however , they may spend that hard - earned money on less than useful things , or fall in with a different group of people			0
‘ we did find that schoolchildren who worked became more likely to drink alcohol regularly , smoke or consume cannabis			0
’ he added the long - term effect of employment would be particularly damaging for ‘ borderline students ’ – those who are at risk of not achieving the targets needed ( five @entity101 grades , including @entity102 and mathematics ) to progression into further education			2
dr @entity66 added that as academic results at 16 have such a great influence over future careers , the results of his study should come as a warning to parents who want children to achieve their full potential .			0
