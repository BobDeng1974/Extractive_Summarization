by @entity0 published : 09:30 est , 13 december 2013 updated : 13:02 est , 13 december 2013 cell phone use on planes has taken another step towards becoming a reality			0
the @entity5 voted thursday to consider allowing fliers to use phones during flights			1
the vote came despite overwhelming public opinion being against in - flight phone calls and three members of @entity13 and the @entity14 taking steps to block them			1
can you hear me now ? : talking during flights may become a reality should in - flight cell phone calls be allowed ? the divergent agendas of the two agencies are coming to a head as technology allowing in - flight calls is set to be deployed across the @entity27			2
cell phone calls have not been allowed during flights for what both the government and airlines have claimed are technical reasons , but newer solutions being made available render that explanation obsolete			2
there have been rumblings in both directions over whether voice calls should be allowed during flights , but the @entity5 voted 3 - 2 in favour of at least considering lifting the ban			1
secretary of transportation @entity43 sees things differently and told @entity46 he is concerned about how fair it is to fliers to have to sit through flights filled with people barking into their cell phones			2
‘ over the past few weeks , we have heard of concerns raised by airlines , travelers , flight attendants , members of @entity13 and others who are all troubled over the idea of passengers talking on cell phones in flight , ’ he told the network in a statement			0
‘ i am concerned about this possibility as well , ’ he added			0
against the idea : an overwhelming majority of @entity27 want flight to remain without voice calls , but they are currently allowed while the plane is on the ground the @entity73 , which regulates air travel , is under the @entity14 umbrella			1
the regulator is not only concerned with travel safety , but also consumer rights			0
@entity5 chairman @entity79 is spearheading the effort to study the feasibility of in flight calls			2
‘ i 'm the last person in the world who wants to listen to someone talking to me while i fly across the country , ’ he told a congressional panel thursday , ‘ but we are the technical agency , and we will make the rules for the way the new technology works			0
’ simply allowing the technology to be used , he further argued , does not mean it will be mandated			0
‘ the proposal would not require airlines to either install such equipment , or to offer mobile wireless services aboard their aircraft , ’ mr @entity79 testified			0
‘ @entity99 would be free , within the confines of the rules of the @entity73 ( @entity73 ) and @entity14 ( @entity14 ) , to make their own decisions , ’ the chairman continued			0
@entity5 commissioner @entity103 , who voted in favor of the idea , explained that silence may in the future come at a cost			0
‘ if we move beyond what we do here today and actually update our rules to allow voice calls on planes we can see a future where our quiet time is monetized and seating in the silent section comes at a premium			1
’ senator @entity119 ( @entity120 ) and senator @entity121 ( @entity122 ) , as well as @entity124 rep. @entity123 , ( @entity125 ) introduced bills to permanently block calls while in the air			1
a recent poll revealed how unenthused people are at the idea of voice calls during flights			1
only 30 per cent of those polled were in favour of lifting the ban , according to researchers from @entity138			0
even more surprisingly , only 39 per cent of those aged 18 to 29 wanted voice calls during flights			1
it is not clear if voice calls will be allowed during flights , but texting on planes - which most people are in favor of allowing - should be available early next year .			1

the @entity5 is moving to lift the ban while other parts of government are trying to keep it in place
two senators and a @entity155 introduced bills to permanently ban voice calls on planes
the @entity14 is also concerned about the effect voice calls will have on flights
