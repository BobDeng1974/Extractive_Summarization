@entity1 ' latest music video co-stars some of @entity3 's most stunning landmarks but the fee local government paid for their inclusion has hit a raw nerve throughout the country			1
the @entity3 regional government paid @entity9 € 302,500 ( £ 222,000 ) to lure the @entity12 - @entity11 pop icon to the north - west of @entity12 for the filming of his new track @entity16 ) , reports thelocal.es			1
the opening moments appear to be money well spent , with helicopter shots of the @entity21 , @entity22 lighthouse , @entity24 's roman walls and the stunning cathedral of @entity26 all taking centre stage			1
@entity3 officials paid @entity9 € 302,500 ( £ 222,000 ) to get @entity1 video filmed there the opening moments of the video feature landmarks including the cathedral of @entity26 ...			1
. and the @entity35 , but once the electronic dance track kicks in the video is indoors even after the star 's name and those of his guest artists , electro latino act @entity40 and @entity43 's @entity42 , are flashed on screen ' @entity44 , @entity12 ' gets its moment			2
but after the moody introduction the obligatory electronic dance track kicks in , the bevvy of beautiful young people multiplies and the sore point comes - the majority of the video to follow , barring the closing moments , is shot as a rave scene inside a beautiful but nondescript monastery			1
@entity12 media say these scenes could have been anywhere and some calculate that less than a fifth of the video features the region - not enough bang for their euro in their view			0
an article by newspaper 20 minutos was headlined ' @entity1 y el presunto robo de 300.000 € @entity69 ' , which translates to ' @entity1 and the presumed theft of 300,000 @entity3 euros '			2
the @entity21 also appears in the opening shots but @entity12 media say @entity3 did n't get value for money @entity1 ' film clip for @entity16 ( @entity78 ) , featuring @entity40 and @entity42 , was filmed in @entity44 another of the papers , @entity44 , counts that while 10 recognisable locations are seen in the video they take up a paltry minute of the overall clip 's four minutes and 43 seconds			2
the publication also worries that with the landmarks at the start and end of the clip – with the energetic middle element that also includes a women being oiled - up for a massage , happening mostly indoors – they could be cut out when it 's shown on music video programmes			0

i leave you a " preview " of what we record in # @entity44 ! @ xunta @entity1 appears happy with the result , plugging its february 27 release to his @entity94 ( right ) and @entity107 followers , including a hashtag nod to @entity44 and linking to the government @entity94 profile			0
