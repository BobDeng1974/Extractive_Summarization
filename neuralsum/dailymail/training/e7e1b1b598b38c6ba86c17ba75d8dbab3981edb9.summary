at present , 70 per cent of men and 59 per cent of women are considered too fat , including 26 per cent in both sexes who are obese			2
in all countries , men tend to be fatter than women			2
@entity13 has by far the worst projection - an alarming 58 per cent of men will be obese in 15 years ' time but this will steadily rise over the coming years as the population ages – from their forties adults gain an average of between 0.5 and 1 kilos ( 1.1 to 2.2 lb ) a year			1

obesity prevalence was generally higher in men in all countries and @entity13 had by far the worst projection - an alarming 58 per cent of men will be obese in 15 years ’ time			1
this was closely followed by @entity33 , at 38 per cent , the @entity34 , 35 per cent , and the @entity3 , 33 per cent			0
but when the figures include those who are classified as overweight , 90 per cent of @entity38 men - and 84 per cent of women - will be either obese or overweight			1
in the @entity3 , three quarters of all men will be either , as will eight out of ten @entity34 , @entity43 and @entity44 men			2
the slimmest men in @entity27 will be in @entity46 or @entity47 , with 44 per cent and 47 per cent either obese or overweight			1

‘ our study presents a worrying picture of rising obesity across @entity27			0
policies to reverse this trend are urgently needed			0
’ dr @entity68 said her study – presented at the @entity73 ’s @entity72 conference in @entity74 – may underestimate the problem by not accounting for the increase in obesity in children			0
@entity78 , of the @entity79 said : ‘ the good news is that the @entity3 yields to @entity13 the title of being the fattest in @entity27 but obesity is a tragedy for both countries			1
‘ the policies that dr @entity68 urgently demands are still nowhere in sight in our islands and , unfortunately for the @entity3			0
' though @entity87 is fond of telling us that things are improving , it is only in certain areas			0
in the main , the fat are getting fatter and to stop the rise , we need regulated markets			0
‘ @entity95 will not be solved unless the root causes of the epidemic are addressed and we 're only just beginning to look for them			0
