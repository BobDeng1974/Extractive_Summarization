the @entity0 is pulling back the curtain on ' automated swarm ' technology that would give artificial intelligence the helm on ' deter , damage or destroy ' missions to protect personnel			2
the @entity8 - based @entity0 debuted the technology in august with demonstrations involving unmanned patrol boats that could autonomously defend and attack targets			1
the exercise demonstrated the escort of a high - value @entity16 vessel to simulate threats in an environment like the @entity19			2
unmanned : the technology should be rolled out to fleet commanders within a year and also has civilian applications up ahead , a manned helicopter crew spots a @entity16 vessel in the role of a possible enemy boat set to encroach on the ship 's path			1
using sensor technology , a group patrol boats then break off in an attacking formation to engage the unidentified intruder , while the remaining assets stay behind to protect the ship			1
in one exercise , the patrol boats encircle the unidentified ship and blare warnings from loudspeakers , which eventually drives the target vessel away			1
if that option had n't dissuaded the other ship , the boats had .50 caliber machine guns and directed - energy weapons that could remotely fire , though planners say the finger on the trigger is human			1
@entity50 , program manager at the @entity0 , said that the artificial intelligence in the software decides for itself what movements the boat swarm makes			0
once a threat is detected , the boats work together and encircle or block the path of an opposing vessel , detecting both the enemy vessel and other nearby vessels ' movements			0
advanced algorithms help the boat plan its route and determine its course of action and speed			0
the ' automated swarm ' technology @entity16 's fleet within a year , according to defense officials			2
the @entity8 - based @entity0 demonstrated the autonomous swarm boat technology over two weeks in august on the @entity72 near @entity73 in @entity74 the new technology could one day help stop attacks such as the deadly bombing of the @entity78 off @entity79 in 2000 when a small boat packed with explosives killed 17 sailors and injured 39 on the warship personnel safety and cost reduction are both driving the development of artificial intelligence - equipped vessels			1
according to rear adm @entity89 , chief of naval research , self - guided force protection systems would have stopped the terrorist attack on the destroy @entity78 in 2000			1
in the attack , suicide bombers piloted a dinghy with explosives molded to the hull and exploded it near the @entity78 , killing 17 sailors and injuring dozens more			1
in the intervening years , the @entity16 overhauled how it protected high - value ships , enforcing perimeters and adding defense specialists , but self - guided boats would put personnel out of harms way			1
self - guided unmanned patrol boats that can leave warships they 're protecting and swarm and attack potential threats on the water are set to join the @entity16 's fleet within a year , according to defense officials			1
the rigid - hull inflatable patrol boats can also fire .50 caliber machine guns , but a human will always be the one to make the decision to use lethal force , officials said ' i never want to see the @entity78 happen again , ' said @entity89 , ' i can tell you the systems we just put out on the water would 've prevented the @entity78			1
' the transportable kit that allows a boat to use swarm capabilities costs about $ 2,000 and can be applied to existing patrol boats and other small vessels in use at @entity16 bases and aboard warships			1
@entity131 reports researchers and political experts are raising ethical and legal concerns to giving military assets artificial intelligence			2
' growing autonomy in weapons poses a grave threat to humanitarian and human rights law , as well as international peace and security , ' says @entity143 , @entity144 political science professor			0
whereas a soldier can fall back on human discretion in the modern battlefield , ' death by algorithm represents a violation of a person â€™s inherent right to life , dignity and due process			0
' a similar debate happened over landmines in previous generations , according to @entity159			0
' when the vast majority of countries outlawed anti-personnel landmines , ' he says			0
' they established that weapons which maim or kill absent of direct human control are morally reprehensible			0
' other researchers say problems will lie with poorly designed systems , not solely its use on the battlefield			0
' it will be critical to ensure that these systems behave in alignment with our ethical principles , ' says computer scientist @entity179 , who has argued for rethinking how we develop artificial intelligence			2
' the security of these systems is also of critical importance because hackers , criminals , or enemies who take control of autonomous attack systems could wreak enormous havoc			0
' in 2009 , hackers breached electronic defenses of ' two or three ' security contractors working on the @entity194 , according to the @entity195 , which included @entity196 , @entity197 and @entity198			0
officials on the project said a number of fail safes were in place that would shut down the systems if contact between boats and operators were broken			0
@entity89 says that the technology was originally developed by @entity209 for the @entity211 spaceflight programs , but august 's demonstration showed numerous boats could coordinate with each other			2
' this is something that you might find not only just on our naval vessels , we could certainly see this utilized to protect merchant vessels , to protect ports and harbors , used also to protect offshore oil rigs , ' @entity89 said .			0

self - guided unmanned patrol boats showed off the ability to leave the warships they 're protecting to swarm and attack potential threats
the rigid - hull inflatable patrol boats were armed with .50 caliber machine guns , giving the human operator a lethal force option
technology could help prevent *incidents* such as the 2000 attack on the @entity78 off @entity79 in which 17 sailors were killed
there are still ethical concerns as well as *dangers* of *cyber* intruders gaining access to the swarm systems
the system can be fit onto any expect to roll out the system to fleet commanders within a year and say it has wider applications outside military use
