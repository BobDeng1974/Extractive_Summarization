by @entity0 published : 10:43 est , 23 may 2013 updated : 13:21 est , 23 may 2013 it is the holy grail that drug manufacturers have clamoured to reach : female @entity3 - the cure for a woman 's lack of sex drive			1
now , experts say one version could be available as soon as 2016 - and it promises to stimulate both body and mind			0
emotional brain , a company based in the @entity14 and @entity15 , is currently developing two drugs for the treatment of @entity18 ( @entity18 ) - otherwise known as a low sex drive			1
the primary one , called @entity21 , has proved ' effective for women with low sex drive and motivation as a result of insensitivity to sexual cues ' , according to the company 's website			1
around 30 % of women suffer from a lack of sexual desire , but experts say a new ' female viagra ' could be on the market within three years the drug is said to ' increase sexual motivation and physiological sexual response , such as blood flow to the genitals and lubrication ' , but also affect the mind			1
unlike male @entity3 , which deals with the sole mechanics of achieving an erection , @entity21 also targets the areas of brain related to sexual desire			2
when taken , levels of the brain chemicals serotonin and dopamine are altered , giving dopamine - the area of the brain associated with pleasure and attraction - the advantage , the @entity49 reported			0
the newspaper reports that both drugs have a mint - flavoured coating which contains the sex hormone testosterone to boost sexual desire			0
once this has melted away , the woman swallows the tablet which has a delayed inner - release			0
but experts say libido is a complex issue and a ' mix of brain , heart and hormones ' the pill is said to be a ' close cousin ' of @entity3 - and , as in men , this enhances blood flow to the genitals , enhancing sensation			1
instead of using the same ingredients as @entity3 , the @entity21 uses buspirone , which was initially developed as an anti-anxiety medication and works by raising levels of the hormone serotonin			2
combined with testosterone to boost libido , the researchers believe they have the winning combination of mind and body stimulation			2
a lack of libido is a common problem , with an astonishing 30 per cent of women claiming to have no sex drive at all , according to the @entity97			1
@entity98 is said to be a ' close cousin ' of @entity3 - and , as in men , this enhances blood flow to the genitals , enhancing sensation the experts stress that lack of libido — the desire for sex — can be caused by a variety of factors , including a deteriorating relationship with your partner or as the result of a medical condition or decline in hormones , such as with the menopause			1
‘ libido is a complex issue — it ’s a mix of brain , heart and hormones , ’ says @entity120 , professor of gynaecology and libido expert based in @entity123 , @entity124			0
however , the ‘ problem ’ of low libido in women is controversial			2
other experts are far from convinced it is a condition requiring medical treatment , arguing the concept has been created by drug companies in order to sell more of their products — and there is nothing intrinsically problematic about not having a high sex drive			1
indeed , women interviewed by the @entity49 were unable to say exactly why they had lost interest in sex			0
' sometimes i wonder whether it ' - @entity18 - is n't so much about libido as it is about boredom , ' @entity146 , a psychologist at the @entity147 who works with patients with clinically low libidos , told the @entity49			0
' the impact of relationship duration is something that comes up constantly			0
' however , the researchers on the @entity158 study have admitted that if the drug works too well , the @entity159 might not approve it or fear of creating ' female excesses , crazed binges of infidelity , [ and ] societal splintering			1
' there are fears , apparently , that the researchers are attempting to create ' nymphomania ' in women			0
' there ’s a bias against — a fear of creating the sexually aggressive woman , ' @entity171 , a @entity172 - based researcher told the paper .			0

@entity21 ' manufacturer says the drug will help women with a low sex drive
contains testosterone to boost libido and also a ' close cousin ' of @entity3 medication to boost blood flow to the genitals , enhancing sensation
30 % of women report suffering from a lack of interest in sex but *critics* say it is often boredom , rather than a physical problem , causing *disinterest*
and some experts fear than pill may create ' female excesses , crazed binges of infidelity and societal splintering '
