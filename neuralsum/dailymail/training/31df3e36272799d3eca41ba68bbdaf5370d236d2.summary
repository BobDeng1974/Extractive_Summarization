prince @entity0 proved once again that he 's a royal action man when he got behind the wheel of a 4x4 and tackled a treacherous - looking assault course in @entity4 yesterday			1
the action was part of the opening event of the @entity8 , the @entity9 , which was eventually won by @entity10			1
but before the competitors got going , prince @entity0 , who later admitted that he 's starting to feel old ahead of his 30th birthday , was driven around the track at breakneck speed , struggling up muddy hillocks and splashing through muddy pools			1
afterwards , he stopped to watch the teams in action and was seen grimacing as competitors slid around in the mud and , at one point , hit a bump with a judder			2
but he was all smiles when @entity38 took the first gold of the @entity8 , smiling broadly as he presented @entity40 and @entity41 with their medals			2
it was disappointment for @entity45 however , after @entity47 's @entity46 and @entity48 took silver and @entity50 and @entity51 from the @entity52 took bronze			2
on his way : prince @entity0 speeds off in the @entity21 after telling journalists that he is starting to feel old @entity56 : but it was a drive of a different sort when he was whizzed around the muddy course in a @entity60 bumpy ride : the car carrying prince @entity0 ploughs through a muddy puddle and up a steep bank speaking during the presentation ceremony , prince @entity0 revealed that the @entity8 were ' probably ' the way he would celebrate his 30th birthday and admitted that he is starting to feel old			1

' the royal also compared turning 30 to seeing a 30mph speed limit sign as you enter a village			0
he added : ' i do n’t feel too old , i think i am always young at heart			0
surrounding myself with these guys and girls does keep me young			0
they ’re sharp - witted and their sense of humour is on it			0
' @entity0 , who has championed the games with the help of the @entity83 and @entity84 , also said his position had helped make the inaugural event a popular one			2
' i ’m at the stage of my life now where over the last couple of years i have realised what a difference it can make , ' he explained			0
@entity94 : despite the sunny weather , the @entity4 course clearly had n't dried out after last week 's rain dramatic : prince @entity0 winces as one of the @entity8 drivers catches a wheel on a bump ' using the position to do good is something i have tried to do for many years of my life , but this is a classic example			1
' speaking to journalists at the end of his visit , @entity0 said he had been humbled by the experience , and everyone else should be too			2
' i think everyone should be humbled			0
the reaction i have seen today for all the organising committee has reminded us exactly why we have done this , ' he said			0
' it ’s a hugely humbling experience to see them go through the process , which i have been lucky enough to see			0
' asked whether some people might criticise that the @entity8 could be seen as supporting war , @entity0 said : ' this is nothing to do with supporting war			1
' the @entity127 public support the individuals			0
it ’s about supporting these individuals who have signed up to serve their country and wherever it takes them			0
' big day : today 's driving challenge was the first event of the @entity8 , which start in earnest on thursday first winner : @entity0 presents the gold medal to @entity10 's @entity40 and @entity41 after the event winning ways : @entity0 with the @entity52 ' bronze medalists , @entity50 and @entity51 he said the fear that people might forget about the soldiers suffering the effects of conflicts when they stopped hitting the headlines ' should be a fear for everybody '			1
' at the end of the day , the people who have given all their money , whether it is £ 5 , £ 1 or £ 2,000 , they have basically invested in a group of individuals , a group of people , because they want to @entity150 is the result			0
' we are going to see lives that have been changed by the way they have been injured , and then changed by this			0
' the driving challenge came after a day of engagements to welcome @entity8 competitors to @entity165 and an unusually frank exchange with members of the media , to whom @entity0 revealed that his step further away from the throne was ' great '			1
but a joyful @entity0 could n't resist a joke at his brother 's expense , quipping that he could not wait to see his older brother ‘ suffer more ’ by having to look after two children			2
catch up : prince @entity0 chats to motorsports fan @entity176 ahead of the @entity9 @entity177 to meet you : prince @entity0 shakes hands with @entity9 staff in the @entity182 sunshine all smiles : @entity0 watches the action with major general @entity185 of the @entity186 he also welcomed the possibility of @entity188 having a daughter , saying : ‘ i ’d love to see him try and cope with that ! ’ @entity0 also revealed more details about the @entity84 's condition , saying @entity84 was ‘ pretty poorly , but doing the best she can ’			1

the retired rugby star , 35 , was appearing as a guest on radio station @entity205 when the pregnancy was announced			0
