' if we are performing well , we know that we are very hard to beat			0
' we have shown that for a long , long time now and again , our biggest opponent is ourselves			2
' we need to keep our mind on the right things			0
' i have felt a sense of excitement for a long time			0
but it is very important to focus on the next training session and next game , instead of thinking of what might be , thinking of what we have to do to make it as good as possible now			0
' @entity0 believes treble success will help not only attract players to the club this summer , but also help keep those who are already at @entity47 and perhaps thinking of moving to pastures new			1
the former @entity50 boss said : ' the players are happy , they enjoy being in @entity51 and at @entity4 and if they see the team is going forward they want to stay , that is my experience			1
the @entity9 winners are eight points clear in @entity13 with six games to play ' it 's my job to make the staff and players feel well and have fun and looking forward to coming to work			1
' it is not like that everywhere			0
i 've had players come to me who are very unhappy and then money is nothing , in my opinion			0
' the day after wednesday night 's 4 - 1 home win over @entity68 , @entity0 travelled south to see @entity4 's development team lose on penalties to @entity71 in the quarter - final of the @entity73			1
after their early @entity76 exit , @entity4 fans could be celebrating a treble - winning season soon out of favour striker @entity77 , who was signed from @entity78 for a reported fee of Â£ 2.3million in september , was given some game time and @entity0 , who has @entity82 suspended and @entity83 and @entity84 cup - tied for the @entity86 game , revealed the 25 - year - old @entity88 international will be in his plans for @entity21			1
he said : ' @entity77 is in the squad for sunday			2
he needed a game instead of sitting on the bench on wednesday			0
' his contribution is going up and down			0
there is competition , it 's tough to switch around when you have other strikers doing well			2
' but he has some qualities that the others do n't have and he 's trying to improve			2
