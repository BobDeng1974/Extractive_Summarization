the majestic transformation of a star has been revealed in a stunning time - lapse of a stellar explosion 20,000 light years away			1
the animation , spanning four years , documents a huge explosion emanating from @entity6 – a red star located in the constellation @entity9			1
@entity6 produced enough energy in a brief flash to illuminate surrounding dust , like a spelunker taking a flash picture of the walls of an undiscovered cavern			2
the star presumably ejected the illuminated dust shells in previous outbursts			0
light from the latest outburst travels to the dust and then is reflected to @entity37			0
because of this indirect path , the light arrives at @entity37 months after light from the star that travelled directly toward @entity37			0
as it burst , @entity10 created an expanding light echo that lit up the cosmic dust surrounding it , creating some of the most stunning images seen by the @entity47 telescope to date			1
the time - lapse uses a series of images captured by @entity47 between 2002 and 2006 , when @entity6 produced a stellar flash so brilliant that scientists had never seen anything like it before			1
as it burst , @entity10 created an expanding light echo that lit up the cosmic dust surrounding it , creating some of the most stunning images seen by @entity47 to date a stellar flash like this was unprecedented because supernovas and novas typically expel matter out into space , often obscuring them from view			1
while the animation appears to show @entity10 expel material into space , what it is actually showing is an outwardly moving ' light echo ' of the bright flash - about a million times solar luminosity			1
according to @entity75 , during echoes , light from the flash is reflected by successively more distant rings in the complex array of ambient interstellar dust that already surrounded the star			0
structures that resemble whirlpools in the star are noticeable in the time - lapse , and may have been produced by the effects of magnetic fields in the space between the stars			0
while the animation appears to show @entity10 expel material into space , what it is actually showing is an outwardly moving ' light echo ' of the bright flash - about a million times solar luminosity according to @entity75 , in a light echo , light from the flash is reflected by successively more distant rings in the complex array of ambient interstellar dust that already surrounded the star scientists still do n’t know what caused the explosion			1
they originally predicted that astronomers were watching a supernova or the thermal pulse of a dying star			0
but these theories have since been dismissed after discovering the @entity10 was likely a young star			0
a paper with contributions from the @entity110 , the @entity111 and the @entity112 concluded : ' when combined with the high luminosity and unusual outburst behaviour , these characteristics indicate that @entity6 represents a hitherto unknown type of stellar outburst , for which we have no completely satisfactory physical explanation			0
' @entity6 lies about 20,000 light years away toward the constellation of the unicorn ( hence the name @entity9 ) , while the light echo in the image spans about six light years in diameter			2
the sequence captured by @entity47 from 2002 - 2004 showing the interstellar dust being illuminated by the star 's explosion			2

animation documents an explosion emanating from @entity6
it was captured by @entity47 and spans the period from 2002 and 2006
as it burst , @entity10 created a light echo that lit up the cosmic dust around it
scientists still have no idea what caused the stellar explosion of @entity10
a stellar flash like this was unprecedented because supernovas typically expel matter out into space , often obscuring them from view
