' @entity11 's ' @entity3 , ' directed by @entity12 and starring @entity13 , opened in line with expectations , but still debuted somewhat modestly for a $ 115million action film			1
it could n't match @entity12 's previous film , the $ 30million ' district 9 , ' which opened with $ 37.4million in august 2009			1
but ' @entity3 ' was able to come out on top in a crowded weekend , with three other new wide releases : the @entity23 - rated @entity22 comedy ' we 're the @entity10 , ' starring @entity25 and @entity8 ( $ 26.6million over the weekend , a strong $ 38million since opening tuesday night ) ; @entity27 's ' @entity26 ' ( $ 22.5million ) and @entity29 's fantasy sequel ' @entity30 : @entity31 ' ( $ 14.6million over the weekend , $ 23.5million since wednesday )			1
tops at the box office : ' @entity3 ' came in first with over $ 30million this weekend ' @entity18 ' was something of a phenomenon : a relatively low - budget science - fiction film from a first - time , @entity37 director that made over $ 210million worldwide and landed four @entity39 nominations , including best picture			1

but it was also made with more than three times the budget of ' @entity18 ' and added stars @entity13 and @entity50			1
@entity51 , head of distribution for @entity11 said the studio was proud to release an ambitious film like ' @entity3 ' and said that it would be ' very profitable ' for @entity11			2
the film launched internationally in a handful of markets , including @entity58 , taking in $ 10.9million overseas			2
with the added star power of @entity13 and @entity50 , ' @entity3 ' should be a bigger draw than ' @entity18 ' was abroad			1
' international is going to be the big , big win on this film for us , ' said @entity51			0
the weekend was enough to push the box office just past the pace of last year , which means that despite several spectacular flops this summer , @entity67 's 2013 is currently equal to its 2012			0
the year - to - date gross of $ 7billion is even with last year , although attendance is down 2.9 percent			2
socialism or fantasy world ? : ' @entity3 ' predicts future where the one per cent lives on luxury space colony and earth is just overcrowded slum ' yes , there 's been some high - profile failures , ' said @entity79 , head of distribution for @entity29			1
' but the summer 's been fantastic despite the gloom and doom some in the media have portrayed			0
' the market was crowded with family films , including new releases ' @entity30 ' and ' planes , ' as well as holdovers like @entity11 's ' @entity88 ' ( $ 9.5million in its second week ) and @entity29 's ' @entity89 ' ( $ 2.3million in its fourth week )			2
with the box office led by two r - rated films , it made for a diverse weekend of movie - going			0
' it used to be called the dog days of august - and you still get some junk thrown in to august , ' said @entity97 , analyst for box - office tracker @entity99			0
' but it can also be the land of opportunity for films that are n't cookie - cutter for audiences that are burned out by blockbusters			0
' estimated ticket sales for friday through sunday at @entity110 and @entity111 theaters , according to @entity99			0
