by @entity0 published : 17:52 est , 6 november 2013 updated : 11:51 est , 7 november 2013 @entity1 the cat : the four - month old @entity4 kitten is coming between @entity0 and his girlfriend @entity5 there was no room for negotiation			1
' i 'm getting a cat , ' my girlfriend @entity5 announced one evening in august			1
' but i 'm allergic to them , ' i replied , incredulous			2
' they give me asthma , they bring me out in hives , they make my eyes blister			2
' ' i 'm getting a cat , ' she repeated			2
' cat owners smell , and women who own them end up sad and lonely , ' i argued			2
' besides , we live on a main road			2
it wo n't last a month			1
' the conversation took place a few weeks after we had moved into our new @entity30 home			2
@entity1 arrived two weeks later			1
they say in life you are either a cat or a dog person			2
i 'm a neither person			0
that 's all the responsibility i need			1
i went with @entity5 to collect @entity1 from a breeder , figuring it would be better to be involved than not to be			1
i was even trying to negotiate on the journey , suggesting we get a hairless @entity43 variety ( they look weird , but they do n't make you sneeze )			0
we were ushered in to choose one of the eight - week - old kittens			1
in a rash decision that haunts me to this day , i pointed out the liveliest - looking one			1
' if you have to get one , get that one ; the others look like they 've been drugged , ' i advised			0
so , Â£ 125 later , @entity1 was packed into his crate to accompany us back around the @entity55 , mewing all the way			1
' you 've wrenched him from his mother and siblings			0
he 's got separation anxiety			1
let 's take him back , ' i tried between sneezes			1
@entity1 's forlorn cries soon subsided when we arrived home and he saw the preposterous array of bedding , toys , scratch posts and cat paraphernalia that had been bought for him			1
he even had a cat @entity73 outfit in case he fancied a game of dressing - up			1
' welcome to your new home , ' purred @entity5 , who fussed over him for an hour before deciding that ' exposure therapy ' was the best way for me to overcome the runny eyes and itchy skin that @entity1 was sparking in me			1
she placed him on my lap on the sofa			0
' have a cuddle with @entity88 , ' she cooed			0
for five minutes we sat awkwardly eyeing each other until @entity1 urinated on me , jumped down and trotted away			1
that was our introduction three months ago , and since then my relationship with both @entity1 and my partner has degenerated			1
teething problems : @entity1 wants @entity5 's love - all of it - and @entity0 is in his way the cat is coming between us			1
while @entity5 is increasingly besotted with the new addition to our family , @entity1 and i have been having acute teething problems			1
it 's partly my fault			1
i did n't read the small print about @entity4 cats until a few weeks after he 'd settled in and started his erratic behaviour			0
bengals are a cross between domestic cats with @entity111 leopard cats , hence their attractive markings			0
their temperament is often described as being similar to that of @entity115 in @entity116 : energetic , acrobatic and overly exuberant			0
ostensibly , we 'd homed the feline equivalent of a toddler with adhd who 'd been fed all the blue @entity122			0
according to the @entity124 , these animals ' demand a good deal of attention and affection '			0
' whether they are fishing in the aquarium or playing in their water - bowls , fetching balls for their families , taking walks on a leash or climbing to the top of the highest cupboards , @entity107 are constantly on the move and are perfect for anyone who wants to interact and play with their cat daily , ' they say			1
what concerned me more than the allergy - inducing idea of interacting and playing with my cat daily were the online discussions about @entity107 , which mentioned jealousy			2
@entity1 's big green eyes were literal and metaphorical : he wanted @entity5 's love , all of it , and i was in his way			1
' they say in life you are either a cat or a dog person			0
i 'm a neither person			0
that 's all the responsibility i need			2
' the skirmishes began with bedtimes			2
' he 's not coming in the bedroom , ' i insisted			2
' but he 's only small			2
it 's not fair to leave him on his own , ' argued @entity5			1
initially , i stood my ground and shut him out			0
after an hour or so mewling and clawing at the door , he 'd give up and wait reproachfully outside until the morning			0
if he was lucky , someone would need a toilet break in the night			0
then , under cover of darkness , he 'd throw himself in the room like a four - legged ninja			2
one night , i woke up screaming after he crawled silently under the covers and clawed at my buttocks			0
he 'd position himself in the middle of the bed , and if i dared move a limb or digit towards @entity5 , he would attack it before curling up next to her and purring			1
when i threw him out , i was accused of bullying			0
the problems got worse as he grew in strength			0
at just three months old , he was easily able to shove open the bedroom door			0
at first , i barricaded it shut with the laundry basket			0
then i had to bolster the defences with a suitcase			0
when he managed to get through that , i bought a rubber door stop , which i now wedge under the door			0
our cosy evenings on the sofa by the fireside have also become a thing of the past			0
@entity1 seems to come alive at night , usually around 8pm when we are settling down for the evening			1
he careers round the house and leaps at me with claws unsheathed and teeth bared			0
@entity1 sees me as a human scratching post and , on many occasions , has clambered up my legs and back when i 've been on the phone , digging his talons in along the way and forcing me to apologise to the person on the other end of the line for my subsequent expletive - peppered tirade			1
ambushed ! @entity1 launches another flying attack on @entity0			1
the results are n't pretty my limbs now resemble those of a self - harmer , so much so that people in the gym look at me with a mixture of shock and pity when i wear shorts and a t - shirt			2
one night a few weeks ago i thought @entity1 had left the room , so i sidled up to @entity5 for a cuddle			1
but he had been waiting behind the curtain			0
in a flash , he climbed up it and then launched himself at me like a feline @entity228 missile			0
i still have the faint scars on my cheek and forehead from the onslaught			0
i received no sympathy - far from it			2
@entity5 thought it was cute that he was so protective			1
grudgingly , i admit his climbing prowess is impressive			0
i have witnessed him scale an exposed brick chimney breast almost to the ceiling in order to launch at me when i put an arm around my beloved			0
he has learned to open drawers , but the only ones he ransacks are mine - @entity5 's remain untouched			1
a week ago , he opened the key drawer , found my car key and chewed the buttons off the control bit of it			0
a romantic sunday afternoon stroll with @entity5 used to be the highlight of my weekend , but - taking a tip from the bengal cat website - @entity5 recently bought @entity1 a harness and lead			1
now he comes with us , trotting between our legs			0
' it 's good for him to get out and it 'll help you two to bond , ' she explained			2
to make matters worse , @entity1 is too small to be let out on his own			1
until he turns six months , he is housebound - and i work from home			2
i 've discovered to my cost that he likes keyboards			0
on countless occasions , i have been sitting at my computer working when @entity1 will run across the keys			1
i have lost several pieces of work as he always manages to find the delete button			0
i feed him and stroke him , but usually he attacks my hand			0
skirmishing : bengals are jealous creatures and @entity1 has not taken kindly to @entity0 sometimes , especially when he is asleep , i catch myself thinking what a wonder of evolution and a handsome devil he is			1
i also allow myself a smug smile , because i know something he does n't : at six months old he 'll not only be allowed out on his own , he 'll also need to be castrated - and i 'll be the one who takes him to the vet			2
so when @entity1 comes round from the anaesthetic and realises something is terribly amiss in his nether regions , i 'll be there , smiling , to remind him that i am the @entity88 after all , not him .			1

@entity1 is a fourth - month old kitten besotted with @entity0 's girlfriend @entity5
he wants all of @entity5 's love - and @entity0 is *standing* in his way
skirmishes ensue *...* who will prevail ?
