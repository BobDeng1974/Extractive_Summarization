a senior @entity2 house @entity0 unveiled this week an aggressive agenda to boost workers ' paychecks by shifting significant tax breaks from the wealthiest @entity2 to the middle class			1
the plan from representative @entity9 has almost no chance of passage by the @entity13 - controlled @entity12 but is aimed at shaping @entity15 ' policy vision for the 2016 presidential election			1
the @entity18 @entity0 's plan calls for an annual ' paycheck bonus ' tax credit of $ 1,000 for individuals making less than $ 100,000 a year and $ 2,000 for married couples making less than $ 200,000 and would be funded through a new fee on financial transactions			1
the tax breaks would be offset with a 0.1 percent tax on stock trades , mostly from high - volume transactions			1
according to the @entity38 , the legislation would redirect $ 1.2 billion over a decade from the nation 's top earners to the middle class			1
@entity9 , the top @entity0 on the @entity1 's budget committee , said the tax - what he called a ' high - roller fee ' - would curb ' the kind of financial speculation that creates no value for the economy			1
' he portrayed his plan as an alternative to @entity13 ' ambitions to cut top tax rates as part of an overall rewrite of the @entity2 tax code this year			1
the @entity15 lawmaker said the new tax would limit corporate tax deductions of bonuses paid to executives in excess of $ 1 million unless the companies can show their workers are getting pay raises that reflect productivity and cost - of - living changes			2
it would also give tax benefits to companies that invest in employee training programs and increase deductions for child daycare expenses from $ 3,000 per person to $ 8,000			0
' we can pay for these new tax benefits for working @entity2 by changing the ways our current tax code is rigged in favor of those who make money off of money and against those who make money from work , ' @entity9 said			2
the plan goes beyond @entity15 ' past efforts to address rising income inequality , which centered on raising the minimum wage			0
that message found little resonance among middle - class voters in november 's elections , leaving the party searching for a more effective message			2
president @entity96 , right , meets with speaker of the house @entity97 , center , and @entity1 minority leader @entity100 , left , during a meeting with congressional leadership in the @entity103 of the @entity1 on tuesday			0
the @entity1 would n't endorse @entity9 's plan today , saying it needed to review the details , but @entity100 has offered her support			1
@entity97 's office slammed it as a ' trillion - dollar tax hike ' @entity13 say the plan is nothing more than a ' massive ' tax increase , though , that would add to the dysfunction of the tax system rather than alleviate it			2
@entity115 , a spokesman for @entity117 chairman @entity116 , told @entity118 , ' here in the @entity1 our focus is going to be on cleaning up the tax code so that we can lower rates for all taxpayers and help create good - paying jobs , not scaring them off with punitive tax hikes			0
' ' our economy is still struggling to create jobs - and the last thing we need is a new trillion - dollar tax hike added to the current broken tax code , ' @entity127 , a spokesman for @entity1 speaker @entity97 , told @entity132			0
in response , the @entity133 accused @entity13 of not caring about the average @entity2 the bill seeks to aid			0
' apparently @entity1 @entity13 only like tax relief if it 's for their millionaire friends and special interest backers , not for hardworking middle class families , ' the @entity133 said in a statement , @entity9 's plan has drawn the praise of his @entity15 colleagues on @entity145 searching for new ways to reduce the gap between the rich and the poor			1
' the challenge is a big one			0
you have to think big , you have to think forward , and you have to think new			0
you have to think new and fresh , ' @entity1 minority leader @entity100 told the @entity38			0
@entity9 told the @entity38 that he had spoke to senior @entity96 administration officials and they seemed supportive of his plan			2
the president 's spokesman would not offer an endorsement of the legislation today , however , saying the @entity1 had not yet had an opportunity to review it in its entirety .			0

@entity9 's plan calls for an annual ' paycheck bonus ' tax credit of $ 1,000 for individuals making less than $ 100,000 a year
the tax breaks would be funded with a 0.1 percent tax on stock trades , mostly from high - volume transactions
