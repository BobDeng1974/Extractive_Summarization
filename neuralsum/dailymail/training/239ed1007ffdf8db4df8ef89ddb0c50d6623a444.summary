by @entity0 published : 18:48 est , 24 february 2014 @entity2 : 08:27 est , 27 february 2014 scientists have pinpointed the exact source of many of the rocks used to build @entity7			2
the say the smaller stones , known as bluestones , came from a newly discovered site in the @entity11 in @entity12			1
the stones ' rock composition revealed they come from a nearby outcropping , located about 1.8 miles ( 3 kilometers ) away from the site originally proposed as the source of such rocks nearly a century ago - and call into question the theory the stones were floated down the @entity23 on rafts			1
the researchers focused on the ' bluestones ' , the smaller rocks shown here - and found they came from a site in the @entity11 in @entity12 scientists have known the bluestones originated from the @entity11 since 1923 , when @entity31 from @entity33 's @entity32 recognised the distinctive dark grey spotty rocks , known as spotted dolerites , during fieldwork			1
further work in the early 1990s then tried to tie down the specific locations of the rocks ' origin by matching the chemistry of the @entity7 bluestones with those at the proposed origin site			1
in fact , the rocks actually come from a different site three kilometres away , the new study found			0
the discovery of the rock 's origin , in turn , could help archaeologists one day unlock the mystery of how the stones got to @entity7			2
the new study , published in the @entity58 , suggests that the site researchers had previously thought was the starting place of many of @entity7 's rocks may not have been the source after all			1
the research focused on the smaller stones at @entity7 , called bluestones			1
the chemistry of these rocks varies , but they all originate from the @entity11 in @entity12 and are thought to have been transported to the @entity7 site over 4000 years ago			1
around 80 of these bluestones , weighing up to three tonnes each , were transported 250 kilometres from southwest @entity12 to @entity73 to build @entity7			1
researcher previously thought they had found the site where the stones came from - but in fact , the rocks actually come from a different site three kilometres away			2
however , they team admit they still do n't know how the stones were transported			0
' the @entity86 question is how were the stones moved and why , ' explains dr @entity88 of @entity89 who led the research			0
' many people think humans transported the stones south , down from the @entity11 and then up the @entity23 on rafts			1
' but a second school of thought says these rocks are glacial erratics that were transported by ice to @entity100 and so were available in the local environment			0
' we 're trying to discover the source of the stones so archaeologists can excavate sites in order to see if they can find evidence for people working the source stones , ' he said			0
researchers found that at least 55 per cent of the dolerite bluestones came from a location , known as @entity115 ( marked ) , which is farther north than the location @entity31 had proposed in 1923 , and about 140 miles ( 225 km ) away from @entity7 the research could change the theory of how the rocks were brought to @entity7 in the new study , the team looked at the minerals , such as chromium , nickel , magnesium oxide and iron oxide , which are part of the crystallizing structures forming in the original magma			1

' the earlier research looked at the source of one of the spotted dolerites and tied it down to a specific outcrop , @entity155			0
' when we looked at it again we realised the descriptions of the rhyolites from @entity160 and those at @entity7 did n't look the same at all , ' says @entity88			0
the team took images showing the rocks at @entity7 and the rocks at @entity160			0
they then asked members of the public with no geological background whether they looked the same			0
pupils of @entity171 try to recreate the movement of stones to @entity7			2
the new theory means that the stones were unlikely to have been floated down the @entity23			2
' we asked people " does a look like @entity179 ? " and everyone said no , ' @entity88 continues			0
' this is astonishing because this has not been questioned since the original publication by @entity31 in 1923			0
' the team used a new method of identifying the chemical makeup of the rocks , to match the rocks with their origin			0
they believe that they have now identified @entity115 as the source of at least 55 per cent of the spotted dolerite bluestones at @entity7			2
' if @entity115 is the true origin of the dolerites , and @entity197 - y - felin is a source of the rhyolitic bluestones then it does bring into question the stones being transported by rafts down to the @entity23 , because both of these outcrops lie on the northern side of the @entity11			1
' the rocks would have had to be dragged up the hills , across the summits and back down again before they even reached the waterways			0
' it 's just not likely , ' @entity88 concludes .			0

@entity213 focused on the smaller stones at @entity7 , called bluestones
all originate from the @entity11 in @entity12
researchers say site they came from amkes it ' unlikely ' they would have been transported via the @entity23
