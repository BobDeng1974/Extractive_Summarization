by @entity1 reporter published : 19:03 est , 10 january 2014 updated : 04:02 est , 11 january 2014 the story began with one of those improbable tales of an artistic masterpiece uncovered at a flea market			1
it concluded friday , the painting still a masterpiece but the story about the flea market all the more improbable			1
a federal judge has awarded ownership of a disputed @entity16 painting to a @entity18 museum , citing ' overwhelming evidence ' that the painting had been stolen from the museum more than 60 years ago			1
the judge 's decision rejected the claims of a @entity31 woman , @entity22 , who maintained that she bought the painting at a flea market for $ 7 , even as others , including her own brother , disputed her story			1
and paid $ 7 for a box of trinkets that included the painting			1
a federal judge ruled on friday that the woman hand it over to a @entity18 museum , which proved it had been stolen in 1951 this painting , which is only about the size of a napkin , is today worth between $ 75,000 and $ 100,000			1
it has been missing for over 60 years @entity53 ' @entity22 ( seen left in 2010 ) maintained that she bought the @entity16 at a flea market in late 2009			1
while the judge did n't discredit her story , he said there was overwhelming evidence that the painting had previously been stolen , meaning she could not be in possession of it in making her ruling friday , @entity64 district judge @entity63 did not pass judgment of the truthfulness of @entity22 's story			2
the judge said only that because the museum had shown the painting was stolen , it did n't matter how @entity22 acquired it â€” she could not legally gain possession of stolen property even if she acted in good faith			1
@entity22 did not attend the hearing			0
her lawyer , @entity77 , declined to comment on whether he would appeal			0
the napkin - sized painting made news in 2012 when an auction company announced plans to sell it on behalf of an anonymous woman dubbed ' @entity85 ' who said she bought the painting at a @entity31 flea market in 2009 for $ 7			1
the woman said she did not know the painting was a @entity16 when she bought it , even though it was held in a frame with a ' @entity16 ' panel attached			1
the auction company had expected to fetch at least $ 75,000 , but the auction was canceled when the @entity95 came forward with long - forgotten records showing the painting had been stolen in 1951			1
@entity98 , attorney for the @entity95 , speaks to the media outside of the @entity100 in @entity101 , @entity31 january 10 , 2014 @entity102 , brother of @entity103 , speaks to the media outside of the @entity100 in @entity101 , @entity31 january 10 , 2014 as it turned out , @entity22 's mother , who used the name @entity107 , was an artist who specialized in reproducing paintings from @entity16 and other masters , and who had extensive links to @entity18 's art community in the 1950s			2
in addition , @entity22 's brother , @entity116 ' @entity115 , told a @entity119 reporter that he had seen the painting in the family home numerous times , well before his sister supposedly bought it in 2009 , though @entity102 changed his story several times subsequently			2
the @entity126 seized the painting in october 2012 and has been keeping it while the courts sorted through the ownership claims			2
after friday 's hearing , @entity102 said he was glad the museum is getting the painting and called his sister a liar			2
' i 'm ecstatic because the truth came out , ' he said			0
he said a deposition he gave to lawyers supporting his sister 's version of events was a lie			0
' at the time , i was trying to protect her , ' he said			0
@entity102 said after the hearing that he suspects somebody gave the painting to his mother			0
' she was beautiful back in the day , ' he said of his mother , who died recently			0
' she had a lot of suitors			0
' @entity102 said he asked his mother many times about the painting 's origins , but she would n't say			0
' it was secretive , and i was n't very good at keeping secrets , ' @entity102 said			0
@entity103 , of @entity156 , @entity157 , maintained throughout the case that she bought the painting at a flea market and gave a sworn statement under penalty of perjury as part of the court case			1
her lawyer tried to argue that the museum 's claims were inadmissible because the documents were so old that nobody could attest to their accuracy			2
but @entity63 said the museum 's documentation was legitimate			0
' all of the evidence is on the @entity18 museum 's side			0
none of the evidence is on your side , ' @entity63 told @entity77 .			0
