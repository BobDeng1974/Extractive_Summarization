most of us are experts at recognising people 's identity , gender and age just by looking at their face			2
but much of what we see is based on the context we see it in – and our brains are masters are tricking us into perceiving things that are n’t there			2
you can test this by staring steadily at the top red square in the below image for just fraction of a minute			1
shift your gaze to the bottom red square – what do you see ? out of the corner of your eye , you are likely to see @entity27 on the left and his successor , @entity29 , on the right			1
shift your gaze , without hesitating , to the bottom red square – what do you see ? most people see @entity29 in the left image on the left and @entity27 on the right			1
but blink several times and take a step back			0
a closer look at the photos reveals that both photos are the same morphed image of the presidents			1
this illusion is an instance of a phenomena , called sensory adaptations , according to a report in @entity48			0
it was created by @entity50 in an attempt to understand the process going on in the brain when people mix up faces			1
pictured are face - selective regions in the brain			0
face - selective regions ( yellow ) are defined as regions that respond more strongly to faces than houses , cars and novel objects they believe that while neurons register an image of the outside world , they are also actively constructing the image based on its context			2
to test their theory , researchers at @entity50 , along with the @entity75 , implanted wires in the brains of patients at the @entity79 at @entity80			0
this illusion is an instance of a phenomena , called sensory adaptations			0
there are of visual cells in the occipital lobes that process the vision of objects based on their contect			0
these cells can undergo sensory adaptation , as seen in the ' waterfall illusion '			0
if a person views a moving picture of a waterfall for several minutes and then looks at a still picture of the same waterfall , the picture of the waterfall will appear to be moving upward			0
this is because the visual cells have adapted to the downward motion			0
to prevent motion sickness , the other visual cells must counteract that motion			0
they recorded from a cell that fired selectively to a picture of @entity27			1
when they next asked the patient to look at a photograph of @entity29 , the cell was silent			1
this showed the cell preferred the sight of @entity27 over that of @entity29			1
immediately afterward , a blended picture was shown , and the patient had to decide which president they could see			0
the patient was more likely to see @entity27 when previously exposed to four seconds of @entity29 , and vice versa			1
‘ in 62 neurons from 10 patients , the response to the morphed picture was significantly stronger when the patient recognized the neuron 's preferred face , compared with when the patient reported the face that the neuron did not care about , ’ wrote @entity124 , chief scientific officer of the @entity125 in @entity126			2
‘ indeed , statistically , the strength of the neuron 's response to a pure @entity27 could not be distinguished from the response to @entity141 , as long as the subject reported seeing @entity27			1
’ the results , he says , prove that the brain has a powerful process from which it constructs images based on its surroundings – and sometimes what you are seeing could just be in your imagination .			2

stare steadily at the top red square for just a fraction of a minute
now shift your gaze , without hesitating , to the bottom red square
most people see @entity29 on the left and @entity27 on the right
but in reality both faces are identical morphed images of the presidents
