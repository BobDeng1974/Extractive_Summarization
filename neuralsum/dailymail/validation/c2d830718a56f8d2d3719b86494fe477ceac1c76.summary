compelling : this picture , taken minutes after @entity0 blew up , ' shows a @entity3 rocket trail ' an image of a vapour trail taken minutes after a passenger jet crashed in @entity7 has been hailed as proof it was shot down by a @entity10 missile			1
official investigators believe the picture , first published by @entity13 last year , holds the key to the fate of @entity16 , which was blown apart in mid-air , killing all 298 on board			1
afterwards , @entity7 and @entity10 blamed each other , and still do , and the incident fuelled an increasingly bloody civil war which has seen large parts of @entity7 taken over by military forces loyal to @entity10 president @entity24			1
@entity26 and @entity27 investigators now believe the image represents evidence that the @entity31 @entity30 was hit by a @entity10 - made @entity3 rocket			1
they travelled to @entity7 to interview the photographer who took the picture from the roof of his block of flats in @entity38 , some 12 miles from the site where the missile was launched , and took away the camera as evidence			1
they believe the image and others taken by the photographer offer clear evidence of the @entity3 missile attack from a position on the edge of the town of @entity52 in @entity54 rebel - held eastern @entity7			1
amid fears for his safety he was relocated to a safe house and has been under the protection of @entity7 ’s secret service ever since			1
analysis by investigators has found the picture was taken at 16.25.48 seconds on july 17			1
the plane ’s data records stopped functioning – as a result of a catastrophic explosion , it is thought – at 16.21.28			0
the photographer was questioned in detail by investigators about the time and location of his pictures			1
speaking on condition of anonymity , he told @entity13 : ‘ i was in my flat in a suburb of @entity38 , and heard a loud noise – far louder than artillery or grenades			1
‘ i ran to the window and saw how the wind was spreading the smoke trail above the horizon			0
defenceless : all 298 passengers on board @entity16 , which was blown apart in mid-air on july 17 , last year , were killed ‘ my camera was near the window			1
i grabbed it and ran upstairs to the roof to take a picture			2
i took my first picture but saw i had electric cables right in the middle , so then maximized the zoom and took the second			0
' then i turned round and on the other side , to the north , saw a trail of dark blue smoke			0
i decided that the missile must have hit a petrol station			2
i climbed to another other part of the roof to take a picture from there			2
' it took me three minutes , and i took the third picture			0
i had no idea that my third picture was the smoke from the just crashed plane			2
‘ i did not see any plane			0
so i did not take any more pictures			0
if only i had known more about what happened then of course i would have taken more			0
but it was only two hours later when i found out			0
’ he immediately sent the pictures to a friend , who posted them on @entity133			0
this fact is seen as decisive because it allowed no time for manipulation of the image			2
at the time , fake pictures were appearing on the web			0
among the dead : @entity140 , @entity141 , and @entity142 were on board flight @entity143 with their grandfather @entity145 when it was shot down leaks from the @entity26 probe indicate that investigators believe it likely the @entity3 was fired not by rebels but by @entity10 soldiers			1
these troops ‘ might have changed their identities or even been executed by @entity10 secret service in order to hide everything ’ , according to @entity159 , a journalist with @entity26 state broadcaster @entity160 , citing anonymous sources in the investigation			0
last week a reporter with @entity165 , another broadcaster in the @entity26 , said shrapnel he collected from the crash site was tested by forensic experts , including defence analysts @entity170 ’s in @entity172 , who said it matched the explosive charge of a @entity3			1
a fragment from the warhead showed a @entity178 letter , apparently part of a serial number			0
the combined weight of evidence undermines claims from @entity10 that the plane was downed by a @entity186 warplane			2
in the past there have been claims from @entity189 that @entity143 was shot down by a @entity186 air force @entity190			0
lethal : a @entity3 missile system on display during a @entity10 air show			1
investigators say the image and others taken by the photographer offer clear evidence of the @entity3 missile attack but @entity200 – the @entity190 ’s chief designer – disputed this in an intervention that was acutely embarrassing to @entity189			1
‘ the @entity190 could attack a @entity30 at a height of three or four thousand metres , but it can not shoot down a plane flying at an altitude of 10,500 metres , ’ said @entity200 , president of the company which designs @entity190 attack aircraft			2
‘ our team designed this plane so that it can be used only at low and medium altitudes			0
’ the @entity213 - born aviation expert insisted : ‘ i believe that all allegations of the @entity190 involvement in the tragedy are an attempt to cover tracks			0
