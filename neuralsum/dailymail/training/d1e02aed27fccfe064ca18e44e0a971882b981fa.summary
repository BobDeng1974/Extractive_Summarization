add former @entity1 vice president @entity0 to the chorus of republicans who seem insistent on making the 2012 terror attack in @entity6 , @entity7 a black mark against @entity9 if she decides to run for president			1
in an interview taped for @entity13 , @entity0 told host @entity14 that the former secretary of state will have some explaining to do			1
' she was secretary of state at the time that it happened , ' @entity0 said in an excerpt broadcast friday afternoon on @entity13			1
' she was one of the first in @entity22 to know about it			0
' ' i think she clearly bears responsibility for whatever the @entity26 did or did n't do with respect to that – uh , that crisis			1
' former @entity1 vice president @entity0 , shown in a may 12 interview , vented his spleen about @entity9 's role in the @entity6 scandal during a @entity13 interview that will air sunday @entity36 , then secretary of state , angered members of the @entity38 in 2013 when she suggested it made no difference whether the 2012 attack that claimed four @entity1 lives was premeditated or spontaneous the @entity1 diplomatic compound in @entity6 , @entity7 erupted in flames on september 11 , 2012 after heavily armed terrorists linked to an @entity47 affiliate group launched mortars and grenades and followed up with small - arms fire ' i do think it 's a major issue , ' the former vice president and one - time secretary of defense added			1
' i do n't think we 've heard the last of it yet			2
' @entity36 , president @entity61 and other administration officials famously insisted in the days following the september 11 , 2012 attack that it was not premeditated but improvised , the product of a spontaneous protest against a crude internet video that lampooned the @entity60 prophet @entity59			1
that claim has been proven false , with the only remaining question being who proposed it in the first place			0
but @entity36 's political liabilities also extend to her @entity72 failure to protect its diplomatic installation in the eastern @entity7 port city			2
months before @entity77 militants stormed the @entity1 compound , the group and other @entity47 affiliates paraded through central @entity6 , armed to the teeth with heavy artillery and armored vehicles , and threatened future assassinations of @entity1 targets			0
despite having intelligence about that event and the press conference that followed , the @entity26 declined repeated requests for added security forces			0
@entity36 , who has insisted for more than a year that she 's on the fence about a @entity94 run in 2016 , has sounded more and more like a candidate in recent weeks			1
on friday she borrowed a book full of pages from populist democrats like @entity101 sen. @entity100 , telling an audience at the left - leaning @entity103 that president @entity61 's emphasis on ' income inequality ' will continue to be a major focus for her			2
' the dream of upward mobility that made this country a model for the world feels further and further out of reach , ' she said , ' and many @entity1 understandably feel frustrated , even angry			0
' ' as secretary of state , ' @entity36 assured a friendly crowd , ' i saw the way extreme inequality has corrupted other societies , hobbled growth and left entire generations alienated and unmoored			0
' but the words ' @entity6 ' and ' @entity7 ' never came up			0
the @entity123 terror attack , which claimed the lives of @entity1 ambassador to @entity7 @entity126 and three other @entity1 personnel , threatens to become an albatross around @entity36 's neck as the decision point approaches for the @entity132 presidential primary season			1
she has publicly said twice this year that the @entity6 episode is her ' biggest regret ' from her years helming the @entity26 – first during a january q - and - a session at the @entity138 convention in @entity139 , and then in april during a women 's leadership conference at @entity142 not talking : @entity36 is grooming her softer side for a presidential run with appearances like friday 's farewell broadcast for @entity147 on ' @entity148 , ' but she 's not addressing her @entity26 's shortcomings before , during and after the terror attack @entity14 , host of @entity13 , interviewed @entity0 and his wife @entity152 for sunday 's broadcast on april 23 she discussed ' the attack on our facility in @entity6 , and the loss of , uh , two @entity26 personnel and two @entity156 contractors from the terrorist attack and the terrible consequences of that			1
' ' it 's very , very painful and it was certainly the biggest regret that i had as secretary of state , ' @entity36 said			2
secretary of explaining things : former president @entity36 has rushed to his wife 's aid on the @entity6 question , perhaps anticipating at least 4 more years in the @entity94 ' they were n't the only people that we lost , but we lost them in such a terrible , senseless , terrorist action that – you know , it 's just deeply sorrowful and it went on for hours – because the @entity156 annex was attacked after the @entity26 facility was attacked			1
' her emotional , contrite language stood in stark contrast with an almost flippant anger during a @entity38 @entity189 hearing 15 months earlier			0
' the fact is we had four dead @entity1 , ' she barked in a moment destined to be memorialized in campaign attack ads if she runs in 2016			0
' was it because of a protest , or was it because of guys out for a walk one night who decided that they 'd they go kill some @entity1 ? what difference , at this point , does it make ? ' she asked then			0
@entity36 's potential @entity202 presidential adversaries have already staked out their criticisms			2
on may 9 at the @entity208 's spring meeting in @entity209 , @entity210 , @entity206 sen. @entity205 test fired his heavy guns			1
' this is about judgment , ' he said			0
' and we 're talking about – should we , should we as a country have a commander - in - chief who did n't provide adequate security in @entity7 , did n't send reinforcements , and then gave us nothing but spin ? ' ' my opinion is that @entity9 has precluded herself from ever being considered for that position , ' @entity205 added , to strong applause			1
mrs. @entity9 's husband , former president @entity36 , has begun to defend her in public as it seems clear that she will have to confront the @entity6 issue if she stays in politics			2
on may 14 the man president @entity61 once joked about appointing as his ' @entity231 , ' said during a fiscal summit that ' in my opinion , @entity9 did what she should have done ' as the terror attack unfolded			2
' secretaries of state never were involved directly in these security decisions , ' he insisted			0
and , throwing an elbow at @entity238 , the man who succeeded him in the @entity239 , @entity36 said that ' most @entity1 do n’t even know how many @entity1 diplomatic personnel were killed while president @entity238 was president			0

' i think she clearly bears responsibility for whatever the @entity26 did or did n't do , ' the former *vp* told @entity13
' i do think it 's a major issue ; i do n't think we 've heard the last of it yet '
republicans and family members of the fallen have blamed @entity36 for failing to adequately protect the @entity26 *outposts* in @entity7
@entity36 also falsely spun the 2012 terror attack as a spontaneous outgrowth of protests against an @entity259 @entity258 video
@entity206 sen. @entity205 , a likely @entity202 2016 rival , said this month that she ' has precluded herself from ever being considered ' for the @entity94
the @entity0 interview , *teased* friday by @entity14 , will run in full during the next broadcast of @entity13
