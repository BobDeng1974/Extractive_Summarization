by @entity0 published : 19:49 est , 23 july 2013 updated : 03:29 est , 24 july 2013 a team of archaeologists have discovered the fossilised remains of a 72 million - year - old dinosaur tail in a desert in northern @entity7 , it has been announced			1
the ' unusually well - preserved ' five yard - long tail was the first ever found in @entity7 , said @entity9 , director of the country 's @entity10			1
the team , made up of archaeologists and students from @entity14 and the @entity15 , identified the fossil as a hadrosaur , or duck - billed dinosaur			1
relic : the researchers found the ancient dinosaur tail in @entity22 in @entity7 the ' unusually well - preserved ' five yard - long tail was the first ever found in @entity7			1
it is 72 million years old the tail , found near the small town of @entity26 found in the border state of @entity28 , likely made up half the dinosaur 's length , @entity9 said			1
archaeologists found the 50 vertebrae of the tail completely intact after spending 20 days in the desert slowly lifting a sedimentary rock covering the creature 's bones			2
strewn around the tail were other fossilised bones , including one of the dinosaur 's hips , @entity14 said			2
precision : archaeologists painstakingly excavate the tail speaker for the dead : the tail , from a hadrosaur , will enable experts to learn about bone conditions that affected the colossal beasts despite @entity7 's rich heritage in paleontology , this is the first dinosaur tail found in the country strewn around the tail were other fossilised bones , including one of the dinosaur 's hips the hadrosaurs are known as the duck - billed dinosaurs due to the similarity of their head to that of modern ducks			1
the whole front of the skull was flat and broadened out to form a beak , which was ideal for clipping leaves and twigs from the forests of @entity75 , @entity76 and @entity77			0
however , the back of the mouth contained thousands of teeth suitable for grinding food before it was swallowed			0
@entity82 likely grazed on horsetails and vegetation close to the ground , rather than browsing higher - growing leaves and twigs			2
dinosaur tail finds are relatively rare , according to @entity14			2
the new discovery could further understanding of the hadrosaur family and aid research on diseases that afflicted dinosaur bones , which resembled those of humans , @entity9 said			1
scientists have already determined that dinosaurs suffered from tumors and arthritis , for example			0
dinosaur remains have been found in many parts of the state of @entity28 , in addition to @entity7 's other northern desert states			1
' we have a very rich history of paleontology , ' @entity9 said			0
he noted that during the @entity113 period , which ended about 65 million years ago , much of what is now central northern @entity7 was on the coast			2
this has enabled researchers to unearth remains of both marine and land - based dinosaurs			0
the presence of the remains was reported to @entity14 by locals in june 2012			0
after initial inspections , excavation began earlier this month			0
the remains of the tail will be transferred to @entity26 for cleaning and further investigation			0
an artist rendering provided by the @entity130 shows what a hadrosaur is believed to have looked like			0

the ' unusually well - preserved ' tail is the first - ever found in @entity7
it is from a hadrosaur and was discovered by *villagers* living nearby
the find will increase understanding of dinosaur afflictions
