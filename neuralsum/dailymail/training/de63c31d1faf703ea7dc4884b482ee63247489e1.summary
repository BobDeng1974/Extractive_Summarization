a second long - suffering @entity1 customer in two days has taken to @entity2 to voice his frustrations with the cable company ’s apparently terrible customer service			1
@entity6 , from @entity7 , claims he was kept on hold for three - and - a - half hours when he called on monday evening and attempted to cancel his service			1
in the end , @entity10 had to call again the next day after he realized his epic wait had been in vain and the customer service department had closed for the evening			1
after getting through various menu to reach the cancellation option , an automated voice states that they are closed for the day			0
@entity10 's other phone shows he had been on hold for three hours and 25 minutes at that point			1
' that ’s how long i ’ve been on hold and they ’re closed			2
i ’m pissed , ' he said in to camera			0
@entity10 claims he has spent nearly a month to get his @entity1 service set up correctly at his apartment to no avail			1
he told @entity37 that he decided to keep holding for hours because he was tired of the company ’s ' poor customer service			1
' ' i will simply never use their services again			0
honestly i do n’t know why i stayed with them for the 3 + years i had been with them other than poor research on my part , ' @entity10 wrote			2
' to their credit , apart from the hold fiasco ( of which i fully realize i ’m not the first or last to have this happened to ) the phone support were polite , courteous , and helpful to the extent they are allowed to be			0
' it was the repeated failure of dispatched technicians that did it in for me			0
i work in the tech industry so i get how it is to be yelled at all day by people that just want to be helped			0
i do n’t like to treat anyone that way , especially at a call center which is so easily dehumanized			0
' @entity10 was finally able to cancel his service on tuesday after calling up and achieving his aim within 15 minutes			2
' felt bad for the guy i talked to as i gave him little opportunity to offer me any other resolution , ' @entity10 posted on @entity37			1
' i did clarify it was n’t his fault , i was n’t mad at him directly , and complimented him on doing what i asked and doing his job well			0
' a @entity1 customer , calling himself ' @entity80 ' , grew so frustrated with the poor service he received that he recorded his calls with the cable company and used them to prove that they lied to him about charges @entity10 's @entity2 video has already been viewed over one million times , which is more than his fellow @entity1 complainer , who called himself ' @entity80 ' online			1
he grew so frustrated with @entity92 's poor service that he recorded his calls with the cable company and used them to prove that they lied to him about charges			1
he posted his exchanges on @entity2 on sunday and it has received over 700,000 views since			2
@entity80 claims the company only refunded him $ 182 in unnecessary charges after he played them his recording of the exchanges			1
the incident came about after @entity80 moved to a new apartment in @entity103 , @entity104 , a month ago and installed his modem and set up his @entity106 himself			0
the problem started when @entity80 checked his next bill and found that he had been charged $ 132 for failing to install his modem properly			2
something which had never been an issue not long after , his internet connection began to stop working for 5 to 10 minutes at a time and so he called @entity1 to complain			0
together , @entity80 and the representative figured out that the problem was caused by the cable outside of the apartment and that it was n't his fault			2
based on his previous experience with the cable company , @entity80 asked the representative to confirm would n't be charged for the repair			1
this assurance was captured on tape			0
a @entity1 technician then visited the building where @entity80 lives and fixed the problem			2
the problem started when @entity80 checked his next bill and found that he had been charged $ 132 for failing to install his modem properly			2
something which had never been an issue			0
on top of that , @entity80 was also he was charged another $ 50 for having @entity1 set up his @entity106 - again something that @entity80 had already done himself			1
when he called @entity1 to query the charges , @entity80 was put on hold for an hour before he hung up			1
eventually he spoke with a rep called @entity135 who informed him that @entity1 had subtracted $ 100 from his bill for ' service discounts			1
' despite his bill being more than halved , @entity80 said he was still unhappy about the charges			0
next , he was offered an upgrade to a faster internet service			0
the offer was worth less than the $ 82 that @entity1 was still asking @entity80 to pay and so he said no. next , @entity135 told him that there was simply no way she could remove the charges or reimburse his account			1
when @entity80 spoke to a rep at @entity1 he was told him that there was simply no way they could remove the charges or reimburse his account ( stock image of @entity1 call center ) taking the blame : an internal memo from @entity1 coo @entity155 blames the company for training customer service reps in potentially annoying tactics @entity80 then revealed that he had a recording of a phone call in which @entity1 told him he would n't be charged			1
finally , @entity1 backed down and gave him back his money			2
' why were you not able to do that before ? ' @entity80 asked			0
' again , that is a valid charge , ' @entity135 said			0
' but since i advised my manager that there is a recording , and you were misinformed , then he 's the one who can approve that $ 82			0
' ' you 're telling me that if i did n't have a recording of that call , you would n't have been able to do it , ' he said			0
' that is correct , yes			0
' @entity80 , who works as a senior it analyst for a large company , posted about his experience with @entity1 on @entity37 and received a deluge of people with similar experiences			1
last month , @entity1 made headlines after another customer recorded and published a phone call with customer service			1
in that call , a @entity1 rep refused to let a couple cancel their service when they wanted to switch cable and @entity191 providers			1
a leaked memo reveals that high - ranking executives at @entity1 admit the excruciating customer service call that recently went viral was mostly their fault			1
the company 's chief operating officer @entity155 says in his memo that the nagging , begging and condescending endured for 18 minutes by @entity199 was part of what @entity1 paid and trained the employee to do			0
' it was painful to listen to this call , and i am not surprised that we have been criticized for it , ' @entity155 says in the document first leaked to @entity209			0
the memo surfaced just a week after the call to @entity212 founder @entity199 - who recorded it and put it on @entity215 , where it 's now been played over 5 million times - went viral			0
' we are embarrassed by the tone of the call and the lack of sensitivity to the customer ’s desire to discontinue service , ' @entity155 wrote			2
@entity1 is currently seeking regulatory approval to buy @entity226 for $ 45 billion , a deal that would make the largest cable company in the world even bigger			1
critics of the deal argue that a telecom so large would have even less reason to offer decent customer service .			2

angered after being kept on hold for over three hours , @entity1 customer @entity6 posted a clip on @entity2 to express his frustration
in the clip @entity10 uses a second phone to call the number again and when he eventually gets through he is told that the office has closed for the day
@entity10 said he decided to keep holding for hours because he was tired of the company ’s ' poor customer service '
he is the second @entity1 customer in two days to post a video online about their bad experience
' @entity80 ' grew so frustrated that he recorded his calls with the cable company
he eventually managed to get $ 182 of unnecessary fees reimbursed after he played his recordings back to @entity1 staff
