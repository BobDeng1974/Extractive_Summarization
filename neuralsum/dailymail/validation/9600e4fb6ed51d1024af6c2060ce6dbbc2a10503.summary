flip - flops ? check			1
twenty - four degree heat ? check			2
now all i need is a fruity cocktail and i could be in @entity5			1
except i ’m not on holiday			2
i ’m in a basement in central @entity8 , moments from the frenzy of @entity11			2
outside , it ’s a typical day — cold and damp , with a sky as grey and heavy as old army boots			2
it ’s estimated that two million @entity17 suffer from @entity18 ( @entity18 ) , which is caused by a lack of sunlight - and up to three times more women than men appear to be affected down here , amid the lemon trees and pink , plastic bougainvillea , it ’s so tropical that i half expect @entity29 to cha - cha - cha past singing the @entity30			1
welcome to the cheapest winter sunspot in @entity17			1
this is a ‘ @entity36 ’ clinic , where anyone can drop in for a burst of cheering warmth			2
but you do n’t have to face the airport , and it wo n’t cost you thousands of pounds			2
at the flick of a switch , you can flit between @entity5 , @entity42 and @entity43 — or , at least , their sunshine equivalents			1
dr @entity46 ( pictured ) originally bought the equipment for her own use , having grown sick of @entity17 winter as holidays go , it ’s pretty convenient : no passport , no packing and the weather is guaranteed			1
it ’s estimated that 2 million @entity17 suffer from @entity18 ( @entity18 ) , caused by a lack of sunlight , with up to three times more women than men affected			1
symptoms include low - level depression , lack of energy and a loss of enthusiasm for life			1
the syndrome is so widespread , the @entity68 has set up a web page giving advice on how to tackle it — which includes artificial sun. in the past , if you were down in the dumps during winter , the advice would be to buck up or buy a ticket somewhere hot			2
but what if you ca n’t afford to ? what if you ’re trapped on this cold , damp isle until the spring , whenever that may be ? it was only when a colleague cheerfully announced that he was off to @entity84 , in @entity85 , for a fortnight that i thought , hang on , i need some sunshine , too ! which is how i found myself slipping on my flip - flops at @entity92 ’s @entity91 on that monday afternoon			1
dr @entity46 is the sort of @entity94 you find a lot of around @entity97			2
a private practitioner , she ’s open to alternative medicine , ‘ taking a holistic approach , looking at the whole body and lifestyle , not just one part of it ’			2
@entity106 is the only clinic in @entity17 to offer a ‘ real sunshine ’ room to the public			1
it opened in 2009 , though she has just moved premises and spruced it up			2
it ’s a normal - sized sitting room , done up to feel like a tropical holiday			2
the walls are papered with verdant scenes and artificial grass , jaunty pot plants hang off wooden screens , soothing music plays in the background			2
in a corner , above your head , beams the ‘ artificial sun ’			2
it looks like a row of wall - mounted security lights — three square boxes , the sort you might get at a football stadium			0
dr @entity135 ( pictured ) in central @entity8 where you can experience the @entity42 sun the equipment comes from @entity140 and cost dr @entity46 £ 25,000 to install , which seems a lot given that you can buy a desktop light box — which beams out an assimilation of natural light — for £ 50			1
‘ light boxes do work , ’ says dr @entity46 , ‘ but this is out of this world			0
this is the full spectrum — infra - red , @entity151 , uvb and you get the heat , whereas with @entity18 boxes , you just get visible light			1
’ the inventor of the equipment , @entity156 , stumbled upon his creation by mistake in 1997			0
commissioned to create a sunlight tunnel for @entity140 car manufacturer @entity160 to test the effects of the sun ’s rays on different paints , he noticed that the factory workers liked to congregate under the sun lamps during their breaks			1
he realised people could get benefits from sitting under the artificial sunlight he ’d created			1
so he spent some years adapting his equipment to make it 100 per cent safe for human use , and ten years later had created the technology he sells now			0
initially , the biggest demand for sunlight rooms came from the elderly and nursing homes			1
the first private sunlight room was created in @entity140 , and there have now been 150 installations worldwide			1
in @entity17 , 11 have been installed in care homes and there are three belonging to private individuals			1
‘ some people really go to town with replicating a holiday feel for their sunlight rooms , ’ says @entity187 , the @entity17 company representative			1
‘ people put sand on the floor , surround sound systems to replicate the sea , the smell of coconut wafting through to create a truly multi-sensory experience			0
’ dr @entity46 originally bought the equipment for her own use , having grown sick of @entity17 winters			1
‘ i was born in @entity203 and i really need the sun , ’ she says			0
‘ i do n’t think you need to have been born in @entity203 to feel you ’re missing the sun here , but that was my excuse			0
‘ when i was 13 , i was sent from @entity210 to boarding school here , and i still ca n’t get over how long the winters are			0
’ a woman looks at a ' light lounge ' - a treatment aimed at @entity18 sufferers ( @entity18 ) back in @entity210 , which lies on the @entity218 , there is an average of 2,836 hours of sun per year , out of a possible 4,383			1
in @entity17 , the average is typically less than half that , ranging from 1,364 per year in @entity223 to 1,888 in @entity224			1
dr @entity46 had heard of sunlight simulators in spas and health clinics , and decided to buy one for herself			1
‘ i thought it was a bit extravagant , and that i should really share it with other people , so i opened the sun room , ’ she says			0
she charges £ 50 for a one - hour session , which seems a lot to spend on an hour under a hot lamp — but , on the other hand , it ’s less than the cost of a holiday and , as soon as you flick the switch , you ’re hit in the face with that lovely , warm feeling , as if you ’ve just stepped off a plane in the @entity245			0
there are three settings : an hour of ‘ @entity43 ’ is the mildest , equivalent to a long sunset , while ‘ @entity42 ’ , dr @entity46 ’s favourite , is 45 minutes of full whack , then 15 minutes of winding down			1
she finds ‘ @entity5 ’ is the most popular , as it ’s the strongest , so that ’s what i plump for			1
and , boy , do those lamps give off light			0
not just light , but heat			0
in seconds , the room is toasty warm , and i ’m breaking into a sweat			0
you can wear what you like — dr @entity46 likes to spend an hour here after work , in her underwear , catching up with reading			0
some visit as couples , while others pop in for a solitary hour in their lunch break			0
but what are the actual health benefits ? we know we get a large part of our vitamin d intake — important for the promotion of calcium and healthy bones — from the sun. some of our intake also comes from food such as oily fish			0
but from october to april , 90 per cent of the @entity17 lies too far north to have enough @entity284 rays in sunlight necessary to make vitamin d in the skin			1
so , if they ’re not eating enough oily fish and are spending too much time indoors , many are at risk of being vitamin d deficient			0
which is where a burst in a sunny room could be just the ticket			0
but just a burst — and no more			0
there ’s a risk of getting skin cancer if you spend too much time in the room			0
‘ the recommended dose is no more than one hour a day , which is completely safe , ’ says dr @entity46			0
‘ but if you did three hours every day , we could n’t vouch for the effects			0
' it ’s like anything — it ’s important not to overdo it			0
’ dr @entity46 claims her time in the sun room makes her sleep better and feel more energetic during the day			0
and one elderly user of a nursing home sunlight room says it helps alleviate aches and pains , especially joints , and has a positive effect on his brain power — it helps him tackle the crossword much quicker			1
after leaving dr @entity46 ’s clinic , i do feel more cheerful and friends say i have a rosy complexion , compared with my normal pasty , winter face			0
i ask dr @entity46 if she still feels the need to go on holiday			0
‘ who wants to go on holiday when you can have one every day in your office ? ’ she replies			0
even so , i could still do with a week in @entity5			1
the equipment comes from @entity140 and cost dr @entity46 £ 25,000 to install , which seems a lot given that you can buy a desktop light box , which beams out an assimilation of natural light , like this one , the @entity345 for £ 150			0

an estimated 2 million @entity17 suffer from @entity18
@entity18 is caused by a lack of sunlight and women are more affected than men
