millions of people - including pensioners and former armed services personnel - could find themselves with a backdated tax bill because of errors by @entity5			1
unsuspecting taxpayers with more than one income could be landed with a bill of up to Â£ 2,000 because @entity5 offices are failing to share information on a central database			2
the people most likely to be affected are couples with two pensions , those who continue to work part - time when they retire and former armed services personnel who now have civilian jobs , but still draw an army pension			1
often the mistake is only found a year later , when a bill for the unpaid tax is sent			0
people are being warned to take a close look at their tax returns , due to be submitted by january 31 , to ensure no mistake has been made - especially as up to three million people are thought to have multiple incomes			1
@entity39 , the executive chairman of accountancy practice @entity40 , described the error rate as ' high '			0
@entity39 , who sits on the council of the @entity44 , described the error rate as ' high ' mr @entity39 , who also sits on the council of the @entity44 , told @entity46 : ' often when people have two sources of income , two tax codes are issued by separate @entity5 offices , each acting on the basis of information given to them by an employer , pension provider or the taxpayer directly			1
' clerical errors are made because the workforce , which has suffered sweeping redundancies , is demoralised and the required attention to detail and care is not there			0
' in my experience , up to three out of five @entity67 codes that we see in our office are incorrect when first issued			0
' in the worst cases , it has taken 10 attempts to get a correct code from @entity5			2
' but an @entity5 spokesman said more than 98 per cent of its tax codes are right , with the cast majority of people paying their tax correctly from the outset and throughout the year			1
the spokesman added : ' the introduction of our new computer system mean that these kinds of very old underpayment cases would not happen now			0
' we introduced the @entity88 in july 2009 which merged 12 regional databases into one national system which means that any @entity5 office can respond to our customer 's enquiries			2
' the idea that millions of people will get taxed is just completely wrong			0

pensioners and former armed services personnel more likely to be hit
problem caused because tax - free allowance allocated more than once
people being urged to check their tax returns for errors closely
but @entity5 say these sorts of problems ' would not happen now '
