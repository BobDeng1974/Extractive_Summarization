by @entity0 @entity2 creator @entity1 really wants to end debate that his show lacks diversity			1
in addition to hiring stand - up comic @entity7 as a new cast member on the sketch comedy show , he 's also added two new black comediennes to join the white male - dominated writer 's room			1
@entity14 and @entity15 tried out for the opening cast member position last month , and the show 's producers were so impressed with their auditions that they were hired to write the jokes			1
they will join a mostly white male - dominated writer 's room on the sketch comedy show as creator @entity1 seeks to address lack of diversity complaints the new writer announcement comes after @entity7 's hiring was made official on monday			1
@entity7 will be the first black female cast member in six years when she makes her debut on the january 18 episode hosted by @entity36			1
@entity15 was a finalist for @entity7 's cast member slot , and has guest starred on such shows as @entity40 and @entity41			1
she has performed at the @entity42 in @entity43 and her stand - up special ' @entity44 ' was broadcast on @entity46			1
@entity47 on the other hand is a former news reporter from @entity50 who has performed her comedy at @entity53 theater in @entity43			2
while neither women is slated to perform on the show , many snl writers in the past have made the transition from writer to performer			2
@entity61 and @entity62 made the jump , as well as current featured player @entity64			1
hired : it was announced on monday that @entity7 will be the newest addition to @entity2 , filling a black female cast member void created when @entity68 left the show in 2007 live from @entity70 : @entity71 will make her debut on @entity2 during the january 18 episode hosted by @entity36 rumors that a new player might be added to the cast started last month , when @entity77 reported that auditions were held earlier at the @entity80 theater for black female comediennes in @entity43			1
the rumor was confirmed by @entity2 's creator and producer @entity1 who told the @entity84 that a black female cast member will join the cast in january - the first time @entity1 can remember adding a cast member mid-season			1
' @entity89 told we 've seen about 25 people , ' @entity1 told the @entity84			2
' a lot of people we saw are really good			0
hopefully we 'll come out of the process well			0
' @entity1 also revealed that he had vetted two black female players when he was initially hiring for the current season this past fall			1
he saw the two women during a performance in @entity99 , but their performances were n't as strong when they were invited to @entity70 for the final auditions			1
' then when the deck got reshuffled and as we premiered we realized , it looks a different way , ' he said			0
that 's when he started the unusual process of searching for a new cast member mid-season			1
@entity1 says he ca n't remember ever adding a new cast member in the middle of the season , but says he has added players in march or april to get them into the last episodes of the season			1
while many have criticized the show for not having anyone to play prominent black females like first lady @entity119 , @entity120 or @entity121 , @entity1 says that has nothing to do with his hiring decision			2
' that 's a weird sort of way of looking at it because you do n't judge comedy that way			2
versatility is what we look for			0
' this will be the first time since 2007 that @entity2 has had a woman of @entity138 - @entity137 heritage on the show			2
four black women : in its nearly 40 years on the air , @entity2 has hired just four black women			0
the first was @entity144 , right , and @entity145 , left , spent the 1985 - 86 season on the show no more : after @entity149 , left , left the cast in 1995 , there would n't be another black woman until @entity68 in 2000			2
@entity152 left in 2007 and there has n't been a black woman on the show since the two current black cast members - @entity157 and @entity158 - were the ones to spurn the criticism this fall as they felt it was inappropriate that all impersonations of prominent black women meant that they would have to dress in drag			1
as a result , there have been no sketches on the weekly program featuring black females this season , excepting the episode which was hosted by @entity172			0
' snl ' has had just four black women in its regular troupe since premiering in 1975 , including @entity68 who is biracial			0
done : cast member @entity157 announced this season that he will no longer dress in drag to play black women			2
he had played the likes of @entity179 ( right ) , @entity180 and @entity181 in the past ' it 's not like it 's not a priority for us , ' @entity1 said in an interview with the @entity187 in early november			2
i 'm sure it will happen			0
' news of the invitation - only auditions that have been taking place in @entity43 and @entity99 broke when pictures of the prospective candidates backstage hit the internet			1
actress @entity197 said she was ' honored ' to be one of the 11 black comediennes asked to audition on about two days notice in that instance			0
' it was an awesome opportunity even though it was such short notice but , if you stay ready you ai n't got ta get ready and we were ready ! , ' she told @entity204			0
' i can share that we all entered the @entity80 theater backstage having no idea what to expect			0
i had no clue who was apart of the showcase			0
of course my comedienne friends ( @entity212 , @entity213 and @entity214 ) were there			0
and some talented ladies in sketch comedy were there that i had never met , ' she said			0
it 's happening : @entity2 's creator @entity1 confirmed that a new black female comedienne will be added to the cast this january following reports that a ' secret ' audition were held earlier this month in @entity43 ( those asked to audition pictured ) @entity226 , @entity227 , @entity228 , @entity229 , @entity230 , @entity231 and @entity232 also auditioned according to @entity233			1
' we were all very supportive of each other and there was no sense of competition or pettiness , ' ms @entity197 said			0
' we were just happy that some new black women in comedy were being considered and given a shot			0
we even held hands prayed after the showcase			0
the show was also sold out			0
it was packed to the max. ' the timing of the announcement comes not only as a result of the criticism but also due to the high - profile departure of cast member and head @entity254 , who will leave in the @entity256 to host @entity257 when @entity258 goes to @entity259 .			1

@entity14 and @entity15 auditioned for a cast member position last month and were hired as writers instead
their hiring comes after the announcement earlier this week that stand - up comic @entity7 would be the first female cast member in six years
@entity7 will make her debut on the january 18 episode of the show , which will be hosted by @entity36
the search for a new cast member started early last month with auditions in @entity43 , @entity99 and @entity70
show creator @entity1 does n't usually add cast members mid-season but decided to break *tradition* after facing criticism over the show 's lack of diversity
@entity14 and @entity15 could follow in the *footsteps* of @entity61 and @entity62 to eventually become performers on the show
