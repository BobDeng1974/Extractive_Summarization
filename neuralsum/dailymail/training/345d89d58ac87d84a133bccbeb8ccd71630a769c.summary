by @entity0 published : 05:47 est , 25 august 2013 updated : 10:59 est , 25 august 2013 disgraced @entity2 politician @entity1 has told a court his wife stole government funds without his involvement and revealed how the couple became estranged after he had an affair			1
the courtroom revelations in @entity1 's politically charged corruption trial have already exposed information about one of @entity2 's elite families			1
however , for the first time , the 64 - year - old was forced to disclose details of his family and how his wife @entity18 had taken their son to @entity21 after discovering he had been having an affair			1
former @entity2 politician @entity1 appears at the @entity24 in @entity25 where he is on trial according to a journalist who was imprisoned for digging up information about @entity1 , he had an affair with a secretary in her 20s called @entity32 and spent so much time with other women he was nicknamed ' erect mr @entity35 ' - or @entity36			2

@entity1 agreed to take legal responsibility for the fact £ 500,000 of public money had made its way into his wife 's bank account			1
' i am ashamed of it			0
i was too careless , because this is public money , ' @entity1 told the @entity61			2
' i failed to retrieve the money later , and that 's a factual statement , but can you say i had the intention to embezzle the money ? no. ' it has been said that the ruling @entity68 is using the trial against @entity1 , a former @entity70 member and party leader of the city of @entity73 , to cap a messy political scandal after his wife was convicted for the murder of @entity21 businessman @entity77 in august 2012			1
denial : @entity2 politician @entity1 denied bribery when he appeared in court that scandal led to @entity1 's political ousting , cemented by criminal charges of interfering with a murder investigation and netting £ 2.76 million through corruption			1
courts in @entity2 are controlled by the @entity68 so a conviction is expected , but @entity1 has mounted an unexpectedly spirited defence			2
@entity1 's trial had been expected to be swift , but observers say giving him a chance to defend himself helps lend a veneer of legitimacy to what is widely seen as a political show trial			1
' the leadership wants to have a trial that 's seen as fair			0
you ca n't have a completely secret trial in today 's @entity2 , it would be an embarrassment , ' said @entity103 scholar @entity32			0
' @entity1 is taking advantage of that trial to continue to perform as he did before			0
' @entity18 , wife of @entity2 's former @entity106 secretary @entity1 ( left ) was convicted of murdering @entity21 business man @entity77 ( right ) whose body was found in a hotel in 2011 authorities remained on high alert for any unrest that might be triggered by the trial , closely guarding a security perimeter that expanded several miles around the court with main roads in the vicinity sealed and many shops and restaurants shut			1
inside the courtroom , @entity1 questioned the testimonies of his wife @entity18 and others that prosecutors presented , that in 2000 he had told @entity18 to take the government funds to cover the expenses of accompanying their son in @entity21 while he attended school			1
@entity1 said that @entity18 had piles of her own money , and that she had taken their son overseas in a fit of rage after he had been unfaithful			2
' she left after giving me only the courtesy of a notification , ' @entity1 said			0
' at the time , i had had an affair , and she was very angry			0
she took @entity137 away , largely because she felt wronged and was acting rashly			0
' the courtroom revelations in the politically charged trial have already exposed details about one of @entity2 's elite families he said @entity18 , who is serving a suspended death sentence , could be seeking a more lenient jail term by denouncing him			1
@entity1 similarly questioned the testimony of @entity148 , who was then an official with a land planning department in @entity150 , where @entity1 was party boss at the time			0
@entity148 had testified that @entity1 made a call to his wife in front of him and explicitly said he was going to funnel 5 million yuan ( 800,000 ) in funds from a government project to their family , an account @entity1 called implausible			2
' is this in line with the way an embezzler would think ? ' @entity1 said of the account of the alleged event that took place 13 years ago in @entity150			0
' would i say something this sensitive on the phone ? ' prosecutors have also said that he accepted bribes from businessmen in the form of money or gifts to his family - including a villa in @entity178 , @entity43 , and plane tickets to three continents - in exchange for political favours			2
the charges of bribery and embezzlement , based on the indictment 's specified monetary amounts , carry penalties of between 10 years and life imprisonment , or death in severe cases , while the abuse of power charge could result in up to seven years ' imprisonment			0
the trial on saturday also began hearing allegations that @entity1 interfered in the investigation of the murder of a @entity21 businessman and of the events surrounding his top aide 's attempted defection at a @entity204 consulate			1
courtroom revelations by the prosecution have laid bare the way shady ties between powerful officials and businessmen can play out in @entity2			0
part of the couple 's influence comes from their pedigree as the children of revolutionary veterans , a status that gives them access to important political and business networks .			0
