today 's @entity0 could be tomorrow 's very sweaty retirees thanks to temperatures and humidity levels that are rising so fast that , by the end of this century , simply going outside could be deadly			1
‘ as temperatures rise , toward the end of the century , less than an hour of activity outdoors in the shade could cause a moderately fit individual to suffer heat stroke , ’ said climatologist @entity5 of @entity6 , lead scientific author of the shocking report ' @entity8			1
' ‘ that 's something that does n't exist anywhere in the world today			2
’ the study 's alarming findings put into sharp perspective not just what rising global temperatures can mean to today 's youth but also how the overlooked factor of rising humidity -- which makes already killer temperatures even deadlier -- will also come to make summertime progressively miserable and dangerous			1
sooner than you think : the study found that huge regions of the @entity29 will have humity / heat levels so high that even moderately fit individuals will not be able to safely go outdoors by 2200 if carbon emissions continue at today 's levels the body 's capacity to cool down in hot weather depends on the evaporation of sweat			1
that keeps skin temperature below 95 degrees @entity41 )			0
above that , core temperature rises past @entity44			0
but if humidity is also high , sweat can not evaporate , and core temperature can increase until the person collapses from heat stroke			1
‘ if it 's humid you ca n't sweat , and if you ca n't sweat you ca n't maintain core body temperature in the heat , and you die , ’ said dr @entity50 , dean emeritus of the @entity51 at @entity52 and author of a chapter on health effects in the new report			0
the highest heat - plus - humidity reading in the @entity29 was in 1995 in @entity62 , @entity63 , when the outside temperature was @entity65			2
while the @entity67 is not known for tropical conditions , climate research shows that it will experience more warming than lower latitudes as well as more humidity			0
as a result , the deadliest heat - and - humidity combinations are expected to center around that region , with threads reaching to the @entity76 and islands of dangerous conditions along the northwest @entity79			2
sweaty retirement : study researchers created this graphic , which indicates how many days per year there will be temperatures of @entity85 or above in the @entity29 as today 's @entity0 age into tomorrow 's retirees the study found that if you 're between 4 and 33 - years - old today , dozens or hundreds of days ( depending where you live ) each year will have temperatures at or above a sweltering @entity85			1
as humidity rises along with temperature , the @entity67 especially will become espcially dangerous as even moderately fit individuals staying in the shade could suffer heat stroke within an hour			1
with the air fully saturated with water , humans can no longer sweat as a means of evaporating off body heat			0
under those extreme conditions , heat stroke can occur			2
the symptoms of this condition include dizziness , disorientation , confusion and sluggishness , skin the is dry and hot , rapid heartbeat and hallucinations			0
for the young , sick and elderly , the problem will be compounded			0
startling maps released with the study show how over time a wider and larger portion of the @entity29 will see more and more days of the year in which the conditions are simply too dangerous to go outdoors			1
if emissions continue unabated at their current rate , heat and humidity will be so high across nearly all the @entity29 east of the @entity123 that people will not be able to safely leave their air conditioned homes for 10 percent of the year by 2200			1
with a medium reduction in emissions , the maps appears far less startling , with dangerous humidity - heat days down to around three of five per year , mostly in the @entity67			2
with large emissions reductions now , the study claims that all the @entity29 will be safe from those dangerous years in 2200			0
dangers : this @entity133 heat index charts the deadly duo of heat and humidity , a tragic team that @entity29 will likely see affecting them more and more if climate change continues on its current trajectory , the report concluded , @entity138 could see deadly heat - and - humidity pairings ( which meteorologists call ‘ wet - bulb temperature ’ ) two days every year by later this century			1
‘ it will be functionally impossible to be outside , including for things like construction work and farming , as well as recreation , ’ said climate scientist @entity145 of @entity147			0
even without killer humidity , heat waves are expected to take a larger and larger toll			0
the @entity156 is expected to be hit with an additional 17 to 52 extremely hot days per year by mid-century and an additional 48 to 130 days by 2100			2
that could prove deadly for thousands : ‘ @entity8 ’ projects an additional 15 to 21 deaths per 100,000 people every year from the heat , or 11,000 to 36,000 additional deaths at current population levels .			0

' risky *business* ' study was a first because it analyzed rising world temperatures as well as the *potentially* deadly effects of rising humidity
today 's @entity0 will face as many as two hundred *95f* days per year in the @entity172 and @entity173 when they 're tomorrow 's retirees
@entity29 's @entity138 states are expected to get hit the *hardest* as heat and humidity are both rising fast ion the region
toward the end of this century , even moderately fit individuals could suffer heat stroke from less than an hour of outdoor activity in the shade
