a former greengrocer has amassed one of the world 's largest fruit sticker collections			1
@entity4 , 56 , keeps 30,000 fruit stickers in nine lever arch files at his @entity8 , @entity9 , home			1
and like many passionate stamp or coin collectors , he spends hours peering through his beloved collection with no intention to sell it			2
although the unusual hobby is n't so highly regarded by his wife , who says she hates the stickers because mr @entity4 spends more time with them than her , it could soon be at an end due to a change in @entity23 laws			1
retired greengrocer @entity4 studying his fruit sticker collection of 30,000 stickers pages from mr @entity4 's collection of fruit stickers , showing avocado labels ( left ) and apple labels ( right ) mr @entity4 , who has collected for more than 25 years , told @entity31 : ' to me , this is a hobby like a stamp collection and i do it for love so i would never even consider selling them			1
' he told the paper he has the second largest collection in the world , following closely behind a @entity41 collector			1
his rarest stickers include 1960s labels from the giant banana distributor @entity44			0
but last year 's @entity23 ruling means sticky labels on fruit can be replaced by laser ' tattoos ' inking identifying information onto their skin			1
the technology , if adopted by retailers and distributors , could put an end to the decades - long tradition of stickering fruit			2
fruit featuring the new technology is likely to hit @entity62 shelves shortly , with retailer @entity63 recently signing an agreement with a laser printing company to trial it on oranges			2
@entity63 have said using the tattooing technology will be more environmentally sustainable			0
although the technology has been around since 2009 , the use of these chemicals - which enhance the contrast between the lasered and non-lasered parts of the fruit making the mark much clearer - had previously been banned			2
the amended @entity23 regulations now allows the use of iron oxides , hydroxides , hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose and polysorbates for marking certain fruits			2
two of mr @entity4 's rare fruit stickers			1
on the left is a @entity44 banana label celebrating the @entity87 in @entity88 , @entity89			0
on the right is an unidentified @entity92 fruit label the role of fruit stickers is not just to brand the fruit to a particular distributor			0
they also feature what 's known as a a price look - up ( @entity101 ) code			0
@entity101 codes tell the checkout computers not just what the item is and how much it costs , but also gives clues as to how its grown			0
traditionally grown fruit , using pesticides , features a four digit code			0
but organically grown items , the number nine precedes the basic four digit plu code , and on genetically modified fruit it is preceded by the number eight			0
@entity44 banana stickers from the 1960s are said to be the rarest			0
the company claims to have been the first to label its bananas with stickers around this time and consequently their oldest are the most difficult to find , while they also retain a special aura of nostalgia for sticker collectors .			1
