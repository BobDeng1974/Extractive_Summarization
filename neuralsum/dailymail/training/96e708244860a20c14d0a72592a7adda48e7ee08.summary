' sleep more it 's the key			2
sleep is the one thing i ask girls about before they train with us			2
it 's the primary time that the body recovers from exercise and it 's also when you 'll be rebuilding torn muscle tissues			2
@entity294 sleep or get less than adequate amounts and you ’ll increase cortisol again - a hormone that suppresses physical activity and fat burning processes in the body			1
it will also increase hunger			0
if you ca n't sleep check your magnesium levels , as a deficiency could be to blame			2
so on nights where you ’re staying in go to bed at 10pm			0
have more sex it will boost your immunity and relieve stress			2
a female orgasm can more than double a woman 's tolerance for pain because it ’s an analgesic not an anaesthetic meaning it suppresses pain			0
that should have a beneficial effect on your training intensity			0
stay in the present moment that is being ' in the now ’ as much as you can			0
make sure your breathing is full and deep			0
it ’s the best detox possible			0
anything can be a meditation ( walking , yoga , cooking , sex , taking out the trash )			2
mix up your workouts for your body and your brain			2
@entity11 workshops are perfect stimuli for that			1
dancing is not a luxury , it ’s an imperative			0
even if it ’s when you ’re alone in the morning before you start your day - it ’s time for a morning dance			0
be in nature as much as possible throw away your television and read more			0
spend less time on your phone and only answer your emails once a day			0
limit social media like @entity350 and @entity351			0
it 's procrastinating and you get lost in a strange world based on peer pressure and competitive boasting			0
hold eye contact during a conversation			0
love yourself unconditionally or you can never love anyone else unconditionally			0
take nothing , not even the stuff directed towards you , personally .			0
