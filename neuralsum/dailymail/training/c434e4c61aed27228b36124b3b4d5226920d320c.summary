by @entity0 published : 01:59 est , 30 november 2013 updated : 03:01 est , 30 november 2013 the @entity1 has advised @entity1 carriers to comply with @entity4 's demand that it be told of any flights passing through its new maritime air defense zone over the @entity8 , an area where @entity9 said it launched two fighter planes to investigate a dozen @entity1 and @entity13 reconnaissance and military flights			1
it was the first time since proclaiming the zone on november 23 that @entity4 said it sent planes there on the same day as foreign military flights , although it said it merely identified the foreign planes and took no further action			1
@entity4 announced last week that all aircraft entering the zone - a maritime area between @entity4 , @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity13 - must notify @entity28 authorities beforehand and that it would take unspecified defensive measures against those that do n't comply			2
defiant : the @entity1 military on 26 november 2013 flew two b - 52 aircraft over islands in the @entity8 under dispute between @entity13 and @entity4 , joining a long - brewing fray in the region as it called for a diplomatic solution neighboring countries and the @entity1 have said they will not honor the new zone - believed aimed at claiming disputed territory - and have said it unnecessarily raises tensions			1
@entity44 spokeswoman @entity43 said in a statement friday that the @entity1 remained deeply concerned about @entity4 's declared air identification zone			1
but she said that it is advising @entity1 air carriers abroad to comply with notification requirements issued by @entity4			1
disputed territory : screens display a map showing the outline of @entity4 's new air defense zone in the @entity4 on the website of the @entity56 ' @entity4 's air force has faithfully carried out its mission and tasks , with @entity4 's navy , since it was tasked with patrolling the @entity8 air defense identification zone			1
it monitored throughout the entire flights , made timely identification and ascertained the types , ' ministry spokesman colonel @entity62 said in a statement on its website			0
in @entity71 , a @entity69 spokesman , @entity70 col. @entity68 , said when asked about @entity4 's statement , ' the @entity1 will continue to partner with our allies and will operate in the area as normal			2
' @entity13 officials declined to confirm details of any flights , but said routine missions in the area were continuing			0
' we are simply conducting our ordinary warning and surveillance activity like before			0
we have not encountered any abnormal instances so far , therefore we have not made any announcement , ' @entity13 defense minister @entity85 told reporters in @entity89			0
the @entity1 and other countries have warned that the new zone could boost chances for miscalculations , accidents and conflicts , though analysts believe @entity9 's move is not intended to spark any aerial confrontations but rather is a long - term strategy to solidify claims to disputed territory by simply marking the area as its own			1
strategy : the @entity1 flew planes over an air defense identification zone ( @entity106 ) in the @entity8 that includes islands claimed by @entity4 as the @entity109 islands and @entity25 as the @entity109 june @entity110 , who specializes in security issues at the @entity112 , said the @entity28 government - while backing down from strictly enforcing the zone to keep a lid on tensions - is walking a delicate line because it is faced with strong public opinion from nationalists at home			1
sending up the fighter planes friday was aimed at the domestic audience , and @entity4 is likely to send planes regularly when foreign aircraft enter the zone without notifying @entity28 authorities , she said			2
' they will be " escorting " the intruding planes , but they are not going to shoot them , ' she said.the zone is seen primarily as @entity4 's latest bid to bolster its claim over a string of uninhabited @entity13 - controlled islands in the @entity8 known as @entity109 in @entity13 and @entity109 in @entity4			1
@entity9 has been ratcheting up its sovereignty claims since @entity89 's nationalization of the islands last year			0
flight control : a @entity28 man reads a newspaper which reports that @entity1 , @entity13 and @entity26 sent flights through @entity4 's newly declared maritime air defense zone , in @entity9 , @entity4 friday , november 29 , 2013 however , there are questions whether @entity4 has the technical ability to fully enforce the zone due to a shortage of early warning radar aircraft and in - flight refueling capability			1
the @entity1 , @entity13 and @entity26 all have said they sent military flights into the zone over the past week without notifying @entity4			2
@entity13 commercial flights have continued unhindered - although @entity4 has said its zone is not intended to have any effect on commercial flights not heading to @entity4			2
@entity110 said the @entity1 and @entity13 have kept sending planes into the zone to make good on the message that they are ignoring it			0
' they have to do it more than once to show they are serious , ' she said			0
@entity110 said the @entity28 government may have miscalculated the strength of the international response to the establishment of the zone , but that @entity4 will hold its line in the long run			0
' the @entity28 government is not going to concede the substance , ' she said			0
' when circumstances are more conducive , they will try to enforce it more strictly in the future			0
this is a pattern we have noticed for decades			0
