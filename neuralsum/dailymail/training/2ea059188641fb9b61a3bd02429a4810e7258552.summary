but his @entity10 companions gave him a different name ' the legend			2
' his most legendary shot came outside @entity109 in 2008 when he spotted an insurgent with a rocket launcher near an @entity51 convoy -- 2,100 yards away			1
at that distance , 1.2 miles , he fired a shot from his .338 @entity116 rifle			2
it struck home , knocking the man over dead			0
' @entity121 blew that bullet and hit him , ' mr @entity0 told the @entity123			2
mr @entity0 's preferred weapon , though , was a custom - built bolt action rifle with a powerful scope			1
it was chambered in .300 @entity128 , a cartridge originally developed for hunting @entity49 big game			0
