@entity0 , @entity1 , chief , @entity3 , @entity4 , @entity5 and @entity6 have been given a home - just in time for the holidays			1
the brood of seven puppies were only two - days - old when they were found dumped in a trash contained outside a @entity13 in @entity14 , @entity15			1
their eyes were still closed , their umbilical cords still attached and each weighed about one pound			1
but after being found , they were taken in by the @entity21 in @entity22 , @entity23 , who worked around - the - clock to make sure they survived , the @entity20 reported			1
' and that 's what these puppies needed			1
' they were extremely small			0
most of them were all black , and some had little spots of white			0
' we later determined they were a mix of @entity45 shepherd , @entity46 and golden retriever			0
' but that first day , they were muted little creatures , just clinging to life			0
' around - the - clock care : the dogs were so young and so close to death , they needed 24 - hour care feeding : the pups were bottle fed every two hours until they were healthy enough to feed themselves despite being left for dead , the dogs kept fighting			1
' at first , they were n't even little balls of fur yet , ' @entity61 said			0
' they had short hair			0
' they looked like hamsters , but with these little scrunched - up faces			2
' because of the work involved in looking after seven sick puppies , the shelter put them in the care of ' surrogate ' volunteers , who were instructed how to act like the animals ' mother , such as rubbing their stomachs to prompt them to go to the bathroom			1
' with puppies that young and no access to mother 's milk , we had to improvise , ' @entity61 said			2
' luckily , we have great foster families who took them home for round - the - clock care â€” night feeds , all of the stuff you do with an infant			1
' healthy : workers at the @entity23 animal shelter described the dogs as fighters for pushing through as the pups got bigger , talk of them spread , and people started lining up to see them			1
that progressed to people lining up to take them home			0
soon there was a waiting list of prospective owners			0
one family , the @entity108 , read about the dogs online and , touched by the story , were determined to give one a good home			2
@entity112 called the shelter and said : ' just because you have a lot of families in line does n't mean they 're the best family			2
we 're the best family			0
' the shelter agreed , and the @entity108 took home chief			2
mrs @entity112 said the process has taught her children an important lesson about the good and the bad people in the world			0
rescue house : the @entity21 in @entity22 , @entity23 , has a reputation for taking on big broods that have been orphaned or dumped			1

puppies were found dumped in @entity14 , @entity15 , in *october*
they weighed about a pound each and were close to death
taken in by the @entity21 in @entity22 , @entity23
workers at the shelter provided around - the - clock care
the dogs have now been adopted out to new homes
