about 45 minutes have been cut from the nearly three - hour blockbuster @entity1 for @entity3 audiences , or a quarter of the film , leaving many viewers disappointed and confused about the sequence of events			1
the cuts come as the movie has drawn criticism even from film critics in more liberal countries for its portrayal of drugs , sex and money			1
detractors say the film glorifies unchecked greed , includes full nudity and is loaded with a reported record for f - bombs in a movie - more than 500			1
moviegoers said all profanities were bleeped out from the @entity26 movie featuring @entity27			1
it is standard policy across most of the @entity45 for governments to preview and censor uncut versions of movies , although the extent of the censoring may differ			2

@entity56 , director of media content at the @entity58 , said censors in the @entity60 , which includes @entity3 , typically cut out scenes or language deemed blasphemous or harmful to national security , along with excessive nudity			0
however , @entity56 told the @entity65 that in this case the regional distributor , @entity66 based in @entity3 , was responsible for the heavy edits			0

@entity85 is wholly owned by the government of @entity89			0
@entity90 said that while @entity60 censorship officials did approve the movie after @entity66 's edits , they felt the cuts were excessive because audiences ' should feel the soul of the film			0
' he said @entity66 should have shown @entity60 censors the uncut movie rather than making one sanitized version for the entire region			1
@entity3 , which hosts an annual international film festival , has a reputation for being much less conservative than countries like @entity106 , where traditional movie theaters are banned			1
' there are some scenes we accept that other @entity84 countries may cut , ' @entity56 said			2

the film has turned into the most debated of an award season otherwise lacking much controversy			0
@entity26 and @entity27 in recent days have defended their film as a thought - provoking portrait of decadence run amok			1
in a recent interview with the @entity65 , @entity27 said he and @entity26 would look at each other during filming and ask if they were going too far			1
rarely was the answer ' yes			0
