' but when miss @entity6 was 18 , her mum confessed she wanted to leave her husband			1
' i wanted @entity27 to be happy so i supported her , but @entity38 told her if she left he 'd put her six feet under			1
' he said things like that all the time when he was angry , we did n't think he was serious			0
it left her even more determined to get out though			0
' miss @entity6 was confident her mum , then aged 50 , would cope on her own			1
' she had plans to study teaching and was excited about getting her own place , but @entity38 was n't adjusting			0

' in december 1999 , a week after mr @entity10 had threatened his wife , the couple 's daughter came home to find her mum lying on the sofa covered in a blanket			0
' it was n't like her to take naps in the day , but i assumed she was asleep so not wanting to disturb her , i went upstairs , ' miss @entity6 explained			1
' but two hours later i came down to find @entity27 had n't moved			0
then i noticed blue patches on her face and realised she was n't breathing			0

@entity6 , pictured here with her mum in 1985 , had found her body under a blanket at the family home she said : ' i 'd look through family photos knowing @entity38 would never walk me down the aisle and my children – if i had a family – would never meet their grandparents			1
' in 2010 , @entity104 visited their dad in prison			0
' she told me he 'd had a stroke and could n't speak or move his right side , but i was still too angry with him to care			1
' it was another two years before she became curious about her father			2
in october 2012 she called the prison where mr @entity10 , 69 , was being held			0
' they told me they 'd been trying to reach me as @entity38 was in hospital days from death			2
i wanted to ask why he 'd killed @entity27 and i realised this could be my last chance			2
visiting mr @entity10 in @entity120 , his daughter said she barely recognised him			0
' his limbs were curled up close to his body after he 'd had multiple strokes , ' miss @entity6 recalled			1
' he had a machine breathing for him so he could n't talk and could n't move			0
' he was handcuffed to the bed but really not in any state to hurt anyone			0
i felt sorry for him			0
' for years i 'd wanted him to suffer and now he was , i felt guilty that i 'd wished it			2
' i thanked him for being an incredible dad and realised he was a good person who 'd done something wrong			2
' i told him i loved him and i was sorry i had n't visited			0
then i said i forgave him			0
' after her visit , doctors told @entity90 that normally patients with his condition are allowed to choose between being treated or being allowed to die			0
but prisoners did n't have those same rights and would be treated regardless			0
' they gave me the chance to end his suffering , ' miss @entity6 said			1
' i realised if @entity38 was treated he would remain handcuffed to a bed all his life and i did n't want him to be in any pain			2
' so two days later , doctors ceased treatment and mr @entity10 passed away			0
' i was pleased i got to say goodbye , ' miss @entity6 said			1
' i would have never forgiven myself if i had n't			0
