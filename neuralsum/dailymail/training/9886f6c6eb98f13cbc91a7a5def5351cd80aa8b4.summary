stunning footage of a @entity2 presenter being attacked by a polar bear while in a cage enthralled @entity5 when it was aired in january			0
but the @entity9 authorities were less pleased with the stunt - the programme 's producer has been fined nearly £ 6,000 for ' disturbing ' the bear			1
@entity12 , host of @entity13 , climbed into a clear perspex box known as the ' ice cube ' while filming a documentary in @entity17 , a group of @entity9 islands in the @entity20			1
he then proceeded to film as a 7ft polar bear tried to pry the box open and attack him , throwing its huge bulk at the structure and fearsomely growling			2
thrilling footage : but @entity12 's documentary has led to a fine for its producer attack : the filmmakers were accused of ' disturbing ' the polar bears ' natural environment in @entity17 the footage was broadcast in a @entity37 programme entitled the @entity38 and me in january			1
but now the vice-governor of @entity17 has written to @entity41 , a producer of the documentary , criticising him for breaking local environmental laws			2
@entity44 warned the filmmaker he faced a fine of 50,000 kroner ( £ 5,800 ) for intentionally approaching the polar bear and disturbing it in its natural habitat			1

' danger : but a local politician says it was the animal which was put at risk by the filming denial : the producer and presenter insist they obeyed all the relevant laws during filming polar bears are the main tourist attraction in the remote region , but strict rules are intended to protect both the animals and the humans who go seeking them			1
