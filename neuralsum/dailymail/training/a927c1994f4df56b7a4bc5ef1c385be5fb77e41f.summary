dilapidated , muddy and squalid though it was , it was all they had to call home - a shantytown in the heart of @entity6			1
today signaled the end for more than 300 former residents of the homeless emcampment known as the ' @entity10 ' in @entity11 , @entity12 - likely the largest in the country - who have been forced out of their makeshift abodes and underground homes			1
the run - down tents and piles of trash are in stark contrast to the opulence of its @entity6 surroundings , home to tech giants @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26 , and its dismantling has stirred up controversy			1
and with many having nowhere else to go , charities say the evacuated residents will simply set up their camp elsewhere			0
@entity11 's homelessness response manager @entity32 said increased violence , wet weather and unsanitary conditions make it imperative the camp be cleared			1
in the last month , one resident tried to strangle another with a cord of wire and another was nearly beaten to death with a hammer , he said			1
homeless : more than 300 residents of the @entity6 shantytown known as ' @entity10 ' have been given notices to leave the area by december 4			1
@entity48 , pictured , stands outside her tent yesterday homeless : an unidentified woman walks along a muddy path at the @entity6 homeless encampment in @entity11 , @entity12 earlier this week , police officers and city officials invaded the one square - mile camp - taping notices on tents and tree trunks informing the people who live there to clear out by today or face arrest for trespassing			1
a walk - through later found only 60 people left and the rest have been forced out today , with no reports of violence or residents refusing to leave			2
@entity70 , executive director of @entity71 , who has been working to house homeless people in the area , warned residents they had to get out when she toured the camp last week - even though there was ' nowhere for them to go '			2
' we do n't have the housing			0
we ca n't magically create it			0
' ' there 's nowhere for them to go , ' she added			0
but @entity83 , a pastor who runs a support organization for the homeless , said the forced evacuation of what he described as ' a crime syndicate ruled by gangs , where the police do not enter ' , will lead the evicted to restore their camp elsewhere			1
he explained ' @entity10 ' was developed two years after the evacuation of another slum in @entity11			2
he believes @entity11 should give land for ' camping legally ' and larger neighbors technology groups , including @entity25 , should donate in order ' to solve the problem for good			2
' the city has one of the highest numbers of homeless people in the country and more than 5,000 sleep on the streets , in parks and under freeways in the area			2
makeshift : city officials plan to send in trash trucks and bulldozers to flatten homes and prevent homeless from re-entering the camp empty : a shirt with a morale - boosting message is placed atop mud and debris at the @entity6 homeless encampment a spokesman for the city of @entity11 , @entity125 , said an ' urgent ' evacuation was necessary , citing sanitation and safety concerns			1
when the camp is cleared out , a team will go through the hand - built structures and tents looking for cash , ids or anything else of value			0
those items will be sorted and stored for people to claim later			0
then city officials plan to send in trash trucks and bulldozers to flatten homes and haul out tons of hazardous and human waste			1
using heavy machinery , excavated sections where people have been living underground will be filled in by @entity147 - leaving no sign of ' @entity10 ' as it is now			2
in the past year and a half , the city of @entity11 has spent more than $ 4 million on solving the problems at the encampment and the cleanout was in may 2012 when about 150 people were moved out of @entity10			1
mr @entity125 attributed the homeless problem to several factors , including the financial crisis of 2008 , during which many people ' lost their jobs or their homes , ' and the technology boom in @entity6 , where rents are exorbitant and low - skilled jobs become scarce			0
he added that 140 people from the camp have been housed in ' apartments , hotels , homes , ' and another 60 had received ' good ' financial assistance for housing on their own			0
officials will try to find people who have been involved in social services some kind of shelter for the night			0
he said : ' we started to relocate for 18 months some of the homeless and intend to begin dismantling thursday			0
' this work is expected to last two or three weeks and will be accompanied by laying fences to prevent the homeless to relocate			0
' but he admitted that it was unlikely that all of the residents forced out today could be relocated			0
excavated : underground homes homeless people lived in will be filled in by @entity147 , said @entity11 city spokesman @entity125 nowhere to go : a man , who declined to give his name , walks with his packed - up belongings after being forced to leave his home in the camp clear out : a man , who only goes by @entity125 , gulps down a drink at the homeless camp a stone 's throw from the opulence of @entity6 dilapidated : a man pushes a cart filled with debris at the camp , which has been described as a ' crime syndicate ruled by gangs ' notice : city officials and police officers invaded the camp on monday , taping warning to leave by today or face arrest for trespassing temporary : a tree house is seen at ' @entity10 ' in @entity11			1
a city spokesman said while many people had been rehoused , it would not be possible to relocate everyone			0
