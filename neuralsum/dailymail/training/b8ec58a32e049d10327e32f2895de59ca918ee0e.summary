@entity0 wants @entity1 to stay at @entity2 - despite nicking the @entity4 1 's spot between the sticks under @entity6			1
@entity0 was selected ahead of long - standing first choice @entity1 for the season - opening win at @entity9 after a summer of speculation over which ' keeper would come out on top			1
the 22 - year - old @entity13 made a series of smart saves in the 3 - 1 victory and is likely to continue for the visit of @entity18 on saturday			1
but despite being rivals for one place in the side , @entity0 wants to keep the threat of another world class ' keeper at the club			1
' i want him to stay , ' @entity0 said			2
' even if he does n’t play he can be a lot of help to me in training			2
' i can still learn from him because he has a lot of experience , he can give me good tips about the @entity42 , things i might not know at the start			2
' he is nice to me			0
we are training very well and he is still proving he is a great goalkeeper			0
' for the team it is better for us to have two good goalkeepers			0
i do n’t have a problem if he stays			0
hopefully i can play well and stay in the team			0
' unfamiliar territory : @entity1 has been no 1 choice at @entity4 for years but has now found himself on the bench commanding presence : @entity1 has been first pick for @entity4 since he arrived from @entity55 in summer 2004 @entity56 future unclear @entity4 manager @entity6 has played down suggestions @entity1 could leave , believing the man who has spent ten years at @entity4 will want to fight for his place			1
he has also offered no guarantees to @entity0 that he will remain first choice			2
@entity0 , who spent three years with @entity63 and won a league title last season , accepts that situation but is determined to make the most of the opportunity @entity6 has given him			1
he said : ' always when you are here you have pressure to perform because you are playing in a top team			0
' there is always a pressure to win games and to be important and i am trying to do that in every game that i play			0
this is my shirt now : @entity0 says he came to @entity4 to play but he is happy to keep @entity1 in the picture ' i came here obviously to play			1
i know that @entity1 is a great goalkeeper so there is a lot of competition , but when you come back from a successful loan you hope to play			1
' otherwise , it would maybe have been better for me to go to another team			0
' it is nice that he put faith in me and it is for me now to prove his faith is right			0
' i need to work hard in every training session and game to gain the confidence of my team - mates and the manager			0
' feeling right at home : @entity0 got a great reception from the away support on @entity4 's 3 - 1 win at @entity9			1

young @entity13 *stopper* has taken @entity1 's place in goal at @entity4
he impressed in the @entity106 ' 3 - 1 win over @entity9 at @entity107 on monday
but despite the threat of competition he wants rival @entity1 to stay
@entity0 believes he can learn a lot from his @entity2 *predecessor*
@entity6 has not firmly committed to @entity0 as his no 1
the @entity106 ' boss also wants @entity1 to stay with the club after 10 years
