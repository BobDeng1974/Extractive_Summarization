likely @entity1 presidential candidate @entity0 on wednesday will seek to lay to rest any concerns that his views might be influenced by the legacies of his father and brother			1
@entity0 , son of former president @entity8 and brother of former president @entity10 , will address the issue head - on in a speech at the @entity13 this afternoon , and will say , according to prepared marks , ' i am my own man			1
' it will be his first major foray into foreign policy since the former @entity19 governor announced in december that he is strongly considering a run for the 2016 @entity1 presidential nomination			0
today he will attempt to separate his views from theirs during a @entity33 speech in his brother 's shadow : @entity0 , right , will say in his speech today that he loves his older brother @entity37 , center , ' but i am my own man ' speech excerpts released by his political action committee , @entity41 to rise , show that @entity0 will say he has been lucky to have a father and a brother who have shaped @entity45 foreign policy and that he recognizes ' my views will often be held up in comparison to theirs - sometimes in contrast to theirs			1
' ' i love my father and my brother			2
i admire their service to the nation and the difficult decisions they had to make			1
but i am my own man , and my views are shaped by my own thinking and own experiences , ' he will say			0
@entity0 is casting a wide net for advice on national security			2
an aide provided to @entity66 a diverse list of 20 diplomatic and national security veterans who will be offering informal advice to @entity0 in the coming months			2
many of them are from past @entity1 administrations , including those of his father and brother as well as that of @entity77			2
the list includes people representing a wide spectrum of ideological views in the @entity1 , from the pragmatic to the hawkish			0
it includes @entity83 , known for his pragmatism in key roles during the @entity77 and @entity8 presidencies , and former @entity88 president @entity87 , a hawk as deputy defense secretary who was an architect of @entity10 's @entity93 policy			1
among others are two former secretaries of @entity96 , @entity97 and @entity98 , former national security adviser @entity99 and a deputy national security adviser , @entity100 , as well as two former @entity102 directors , @entity103 and @entity104			0
with polls showing @entity0 a front - runner among @entity1 candidates jockeying for the 2016 nomination , his aim is to set his own course on @entity45 foreign policy without getting entangled in a debate about the legacy of his father and older brother			1
@entity0 has said in the past that he supports his brother 's decision to go to war in @entity119 in 2003 , which could leave him open to attack from @entity121 should he win the nomination			1
his complaint about the recent past in @entity119 is that president @entity125 has let @entity45 influence wane in the region			0
' each president learns from those who came before , their principles , their adjustments , ' @entity0 will say			2
' one thing we know is this : every president inherits a changing world , and changing circumstances			0

after then - host @entity149 asked @entity0 which of his brother 's policies he most disagreed with , the younger @entity0 - accompanied by his father for the interview - said , ' i ’m the only @entity1 that was in office when he was in office as president that never disagreed with him and i ’m not going to start now			1
' @entity0 argued that it would n't make sense with his brother out of office to begin critiquing him			1
' i ’m not going to start now			0
it ’s just till death do us part , ' he said			1
' @entity164 ' : the @entity138 pushed back on @entity0 's assertion that he wo n't be influenced by his brother or father by circulating a 2010 clip of @entity0 refusing to criticize his brother 's leadership with both his father , who held the presidency for just one term before being ousted by @entity174 , and brother 's legacies now threatening to overshadow his on presidential aspirations , @entity0 now finds himself in the precarious position of needing to visibly separate his policies from theirs without throwing either to the wolves			1
@entity0 's @entity33 speech is the second in a series of appearances designed to outline the foundation for what is likely to be a presidential campaign			1
two weeks ago in @entity189 at the launch of his leadership pac he discussed his views on reducing income inequality and bolstering the @entity45 economy			0
his @entity33 speech comes as the @entity45 grapples with the threats posed by @entity198 militants and @entity200 's aggression in eastern @entity201			2
@entity125 has relied heavily on air strikes against @entity198 targets in @entity204 and @entity119 , but the militants retain large swathes of territory in both countries			0
the @entity45 has joined with @entity209 allies to impose sanctions on @entity200 that have had an impact but have yet to force @entity212 to pull back			0
@entity0 will criticize @entity125 's handling of foreign policy and say that @entity45 leadership must projected consistently			1
' under this administration , we are inconsistent and indecisive , ' he will say			0
' we have lost the trust and the confidence of our friends			0
we definitely no longer inspire fear in our enemies			0
' his list of advisers suggests a willingness to listen to a variety of views from people with long experience , including former @entity88 president @entity231			0
others include @entity233 , a former undersecretary of state , @entity235 , a former @entity45 ambassador to the @entity236 , @entity237 , who was a long - time member of the @entity239 from @entity19 , and @entity240 who was vice president @entity241 's national security adviser .			2
