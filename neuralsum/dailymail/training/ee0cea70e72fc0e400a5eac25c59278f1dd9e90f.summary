' we will use all the laws we have available to us to ensure there is no repetition			0

' establishments like @entity14 have a responsibility to make sure the law is upheld and we say the bar and carnage have not adopted all objective measures to guarantee that was the case			1
' the sole possibility that there were under - age children present is a more than sufficient reason to sanction according to the law			0
' @entity14 has windows for instance and from outside you can see what ’s happening inside			0
' the police report is very comprehensive and the town hall obviously feels it has enough evidence to name @entity14 as the bar where the video was taken			1
