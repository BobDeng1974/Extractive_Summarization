by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity3 's capital state could have its very own landmark @entity5 - style sign			1
the idea to erect a sign spelling out @entity9 was put forward by @entity11 - born @entity10 who hopes her vision will soon become a reality			1
the campaign , driven by ms @entity10 who is now a proud @entity15 , could be @entity9 's answer to removing itself from the @entity18 stigma			1
' if @entity9 bores you , it 's because you 're a boring person			2
there 's too much to do			0
@entity9 has an eclectic side with really interesting people			2
' the founding team member of @entity37 - who are behind @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 - simply wants her hometown @entity9 to have its very own iconic monument			2
' it 's not that i 'm @entity11 and want to copy @entity5 , ' she said			0
' the @entity5 sign is big , memorable , people engage with it , it 's really develops a life of its own , it was originally put up to promote that there was land for sale			2
' people did n't like the @entity5 sign at first , but people have embraced it			0
' but this site does n't have anything to do with @entity5 other than that it 's on the side of hill , it 's great for tourism and promotional for @entity9 , such a great image , so many great images could come from a @entity9 sign on the hill			1
' however the potential site , a quarry owned by @entity9 businessman @entity67 , is technically in @entity68			1
' it 's a prime location for welcoming people to @entity9 , ' ms @entity10 said			1
@entity10 , who 's driving the campaign , says the @entity9 sign should be big and memorable like the @entity5 sign ' for many years now @entity9 tourism has promoted gourmet food trails and wine districts that are on the outskirts of town , it does n’t really matter , tourism has embraced its regional areas			1
' she first spoke to the owner about her idea back in february 2011 as she believes the land has a lot of potential			2
' it 's a great opportunity to put something there that a lot of people can see , ' ms @entity10 said			1
' you 'd be able to see the sign flying in and out			0
we 'd be able to project images onto it and so many community groups could use it , sporting groups could light it up in their colours , @entity95 images could be projected on it and we can light it up pink for breast cancer			0
' but the idea has n't come without criticism			0
' there 's been a lot very positive reactions because they get that it 's not just to put a sign up but to create a landmark , ' ms @entity10 said			1
' others think it 's tacky , why are we copying another idea ? but everything 's copied these days , nothing 's new , it 's about taking something and making it their own			0
ms @entity10 hopes the community will jump on board the development process , which will source its funding from donations			1
' i want the sign to be driven by the community and i 'm looking into crowd funding , ' she said			2
she said a competition could be run for the design of the sign , where university students can also submit their proposals			0
' i hope people will look forward to seeing it – like the changing @entity143 icon			0
the sunsets are beautiful , the quarry looks so different at different times of the day , images are endless			0
if we put up installations and artworks , it could really develop a life of its own			0

land is owned by a @entity9 businessman @entity165 ' @entity166 ' @entity67
