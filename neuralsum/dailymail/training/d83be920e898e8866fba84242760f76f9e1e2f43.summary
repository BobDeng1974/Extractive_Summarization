’ every year , @entity4 matches up all its files to ensure people have paid the correct tax , called an ‘ end of year reconciliation ’			1
this used to be a fiendishly complex task as the @entity20 had 12 different computer systems			0
after their merger , it was hoped this would smooth out discrepancies and allow @entity18 taxpayers to pay the correct samount of income tax and @entity67			2
however , two years ago , the government conceded the new computer had found 5.8 million people who had paid the wrong tax between 2008 and 2010			0

’ he added that , ahead of the revenue ’s planned switch to so - called ‘ real time ’ @entity18 collection – where workers ’ tax affairs can be calculated on a minute - by - minute basis – it had much work to do to understand how its business will change			0
