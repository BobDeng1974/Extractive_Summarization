covering aircraft in blue lights , and only turning them on when beginning to take off , could help stop birds colliding with aircraft			1
that ’s according to a study , which found that birds responded to lights in different ways than a human might			1
the researchers said runways could be synced with taxiing aircraft , to help capture birds ’ attention before an aircraft takes off			2
the study was conducted by scientists at @entity18 in @entity19			1
they were investigating how to reduce bird to aircraft collisions by keeping birds away from planes ( stock image shown )			1
@entity26 showed that birds responded most to blue lights on planes the study , by scientists at @entity18 in @entity19 and the @entity30 in @entity31 , was published in the @entity32 : @entity33			1
they were seeking to find a solution to the problem of birds colliding with aircraft , which causes £ 480 million ( $ 700 million ) worth of damage in the @entity40 alone			2
the @entity41 estimates that bird strikes have resulted in 200 worldwide deaths since 1988			0
they are dangerous to aircraft because birds can be sucked into a jet engine and strike an engine fan blade			2
that impact knocks out a single blade and can trigger a domino effect , resulting in engine failure			0
incidents are most common shortly before landing or take - off when the jet engines are at top speed			0
a 12lb ( five kg ) goose striking an aircraft going 150 mph ( 240 km / h ) at lift - off generates the force of a 1,000lb ( 450kg ) weight dropped from a height of 10ft ( three metres ) , according to @entity63			0
despite this , the number of accidents involving civil aircraft is low , estimated at one fatal accident in one billion flying hours			0
around 65 per cent of bird strikes cause little damage to aircraft , but the blow is usually fatal to the bird			0
in experiments , they studied how flocks of cowbirds responded to model aircraft			0
they found that blue light was the most noticeable by birds , so they outfitted the aircraft in this colour			2
when the plane was stationary , the birds became alert more quickly when the lights were on			0
but when it approached them with its lights off , their response slowed - and they only became more alert when the lights were turned on			0
and the birds were also more likely to get out of the way of the aircraft when the lights were pulsing , rather than being continuous			2
the authors suggest that runways could be synced with aircraft to alert birds to incoming planes and avoid collisions			1
the lights could be off during taxiing but on during take - off , to help the birds move out of the way of the fast - moving planes			1
and they say their method could even help birds avoid collisions with buildings and wind turbines by also covering them in blue lights			1

‘ however , in this study , we followed a sensory ecology approach to establish a-priori a light that would be particularly conspicuous to our study species and tested the responses of individuals to this light tuned to their eyes			0
‘ in addition , we showed that by pulsing the light , we reduced the effects of high speeds on the ability of the animals to become alert to the approaching aircraft			0
‘ these findings hold implications for how we might enhance bird response to larger , faster aircraft			0

@entity26 showed that birds responded most to blue lights on planes
and turning the lights on while taking off - not before - had the best effect
