the black outfielder was signing autographs before a game in @entity8 when he was branded a ' monday ' by a heckler in the stands			1

' @entity16 ' : @entity1 police officer @entity14 ( left ) has been fired for calling @entity4 outfielder @entity3 ( right ) a racially offensive name the term ' monday ' can be used as a racist statement towards african - americans and in some cases is tantamount to calling them a ' n * * * * * ' , according to the @entity23			1
it comes from the common dislike for the first day of the working week and is often used in the hope the abused person will not be aware it is an insult			0
in a letter informing @entity14 of his decision to fire him , @entity11 said : ' your actions are so egregious that severe discipline is warranted			2
' there is simply no place for your behavior in the workplace and there is no place for someone who exhibits such objectionable behavior in the @entity42			0
' @entity11 's decision comes a day after police chief @entity44 recommended during a disciplinary hearing that the mayor fire @entity46 , saying he 'd used racial slurs at least twice before			0
heckled : @entity3 was signing autographs in front of the dugout before a game when he was called a ' monday ' by @entity14 , who was sitting in the stands @entity14 's attorney , @entity53 , said his client would either appeal through the civil service commission or file a grievance through the police union			1
@entity53 said @entity14 did n't intend the word as a racist insult and the city overreacted			1

a @entity4 spokeswoman said the team would have no comment on the decision			0
the term ' monday ' has several meanings			0
it is associated with the idea that monday is the most - hated day of the week			0
but it is also used as a derogatory term for blacks and can be as offensive as using the word ' n * * * * * '			1
it is often employed in the hope the victim will not be aware they are being insulted because it is such a mundane word			0
according to @entity23 , it has been used in a routine by @entity82 comedian @entity81 in which he says : ' damn it , that monday over there stole my car ! ' @entity14 had been on paid leave since he called @entity3 a ' monday ' before a july 5 minor league game in @entity92 , @entity8 @entity3 was playing with a @entity4 minor league affiliate while rehabilitating a wrist injury and @entity14 attended the game while off duty			1

' @entity11 said @entity14 's facebook page also contained racially insensitive content and said the officer had even referred to his monday comment as ' priceless ' on there			1
@entity53 said two superior officers with @entity14 at the parade clearly did n't consider the remark improper because they did n't report it , even though they 're obligated to report anything that violates department rules			2
he said @entity46 's alleged remarks at the bar were hearsay because the city relied on a written statement and never produced the witness for questioning			0
also , @entity53 said , almost no one at the hearing , including @entity14 , was previously aware that monday can be used as a racist term			1
' he feels strongly he did n't mean the comment in a racial way , and he 's not a racist , and he wants to establish that , ' @entity53 said			2
but @entity11 did n't believe @entity14 's explanations			0
' in arriving at this conclusion , i did not check common sense at the door , ' he wrote , adding the word monday was ' certainly directed at mr @entity3 's race			0
' @entity14 is considering an appeal .			0
