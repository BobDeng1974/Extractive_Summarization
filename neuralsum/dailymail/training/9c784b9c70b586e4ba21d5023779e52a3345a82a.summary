tv host @entity0 , 40 , is launching the club night in @entity2 this september called @entity3 it 's the same story every saturday and sunday morning as millions of @entity5 wake up nursing stupendous hangovers			1
12 hours earlier as punters in bars , nightclubs and restaurants they will have been queuing up to hand over their hard - earned cash in return for enough booze to get drunk out of their minds			1
now one man is hoping to change this centuries - old tradition with the invention of a new type watering hole : an alcohol - free nightclub			1
@entity0 , 40 , is launching a club night in @entity2 this september called @entity3 , that will only stock soft drinks and promises to bar entry to drunk guests			1
the @entity29 tv host and comedian decided to launch the evening to help people change their relationship with alcohol			1
he came up with the idea after quitting alcohol himself seven months ago			1
he told the @entity34 : ' i love what happened to me when i stopped drinking - i had been talking about doing it for some time , because i had started to feel anxiety when i drank			1
' then i was out partying one weekend , got too drunk and just decided to take a break			2
' it was only supposed to be for a month , but then i realised that on monday , tuesday and wednesday i was usually still feeling the effects of a hangover , so i was basically wasting half of my week			0
' i 'm not an alcoholic , so i will probably drink again at some point because i really enjoy the taste of wine , but my attitude to drinking has now changed			0
' @entity51 now socialises completely without alcohol and reckons he has never had a better time - dancing more and having more confidence to meet people when he goes out			1
he is convinced that there are many more people like him , who would enjoy clubbing without being under the influence , they just do n't know it yet			2
he said : ' around 95 per cent of the people who i 've told about my idea have been really positive , but they are also very curious about a lot of things , like how it would work financially and whether it will be boring , or will people dance			2
' well i can tell you that i have never danced so much as i do now that i am sober			0
' and each time you go out without drinking , you come home and realise that you have become more confident in doing things like talking to people			2
late - night drunken queasiness could soon be a thing of the past if alcohol - free club nights catch on ' because you no longer need the alcohol for confidence - you can do it on its own			1
' the theory is that we really only get drunk most of the time out of habit , because we are so used to drinking alcohol with social activities that it becomes second nature			1
@entity87 said : ' if you want to drink , then drink			0
but do n't just do it on auto - pilot because it 's what you have always done			2
' i just made a change because my therapist said that we often associate everything with alcohol			1
' so going to a football game - you drink , going bowling - you drink , meeting up with friends - you drink			2
' this club is a way of making people discover themselves without those toxins			1
' @entity51 is going out of his way to make sure that the club night wo n't feel like one of the main elements is lacking , with bartenders and mixologists creating and sourcing all of the alcohol - free drinks so that they will hopefully taste just as good as normal alcoholic beverages			1
he said : ' if you 're a person who does n't drink alcohol normally , you 're doomed to second class drinks			2
the @entity3 club night will provide alcohol - free drinks that aim to taste as good as normal boozy beverages like wine , beer and champagne ' you get these horrible sugary juices or a lemonade and lime fizzy thing that is so boring , because you are no use to the bar if you are not drinking because they wo n't make any money out of you			1
' but we are going to focus on lovingly made alcohol - free drinks - you can get some great beers and cocktails that do n't need alcohol			1
' there is even great tasting alcohol - free champagne that comes in a beautiful bottle , so you will still have all of the extras that usually would come with the alcohol			1
' and it will be exactly like a normal club , with great @entity144 's , good music , good drinks , a nice venue and maybe even go - go dancers , it just wo n't have drunk people in it			1
' and if it 's so good that drunk people want to also try and get in , they wo n't be allowed			1
@entity87 believes the dance floor at his @entity3 club night will be even more packed than a normal club			1
he said : ' i dance more now than i ever used to when i was drinking			0
' bouncers on the door will be given breathalysers to weed out any punters who deny they 've been on the sauce and anyone who does manage to sneak in will be booted out if discovered			2
@entity87 said : ' that may sound a bit harsh , but if they are drinking then they can go to any of the other 99.9 per cent of clubs available that do sell alcohol			2
' this is a place for people who do n't want people drunkenly coming on to them or bumping into them			2
' to be honest though , if they were drunk i do n't think they would want to come in because they would feel stupid , they would be the only ones who were and everyone would be looking at them			2
' if anyone is doubting whether the night will be a success , they only need to look at the number of tickets sold for the first event on september 26 at @entity183 in @entity2			1
600 of the 750 tickets available have already sold out , with five weeks to go			0
early morning club workout sessions called ' @entity186 ' where music - lovers are encouraged to rave their way into the day the trend for raves without booze are building in popularity in the @entity193 too , with early morning dance club workouts called ' @entity186 ' having huge success in @entity196			1
although whether the events would have the same popularity if they took place at night is yet to be seen			0
@entity87 said : ' the world is ready for an alternative , there are a lot of us who would enjoy going out without being surrounded by p * * * * heads			0
' and if it is a success , this is n't just going to be a club night , it will hopefully be bigger than that			1
' @entity3 will hopefully be a whole project , an inspiration			0
' i 'd like to see it as a community , where we could do lectures and try to inspire people to start thinking about how they are drinking and also how they live their lives			0
' then maybe start a restaurant without alcohol , that is fair trade and ecological			0
i have connections in the @entity193 too through my comedy work , so i could always try it there too			0
' @entity231 raving is easy after one too many mojitos , but what about when you 're sober ? writer @entity235 tried the new urban fitness trend for health and beauty @entity237			0
@entity240 and her friend @entity241 raving their way into the day she says : ' it 's not unheard of for me to find myself in the middle of a sweaty dance floor as the sun comes up			0
some of my best memories involve dancing till dawn with my most glamorous gal pals			0
what is unheard of is for me to be doing it completely sober			0
' @entity254 is billed as an ' immersive morning experience ' encouraging dance fans to rave their way into the day , without drink , drugs or judgement			0
the team behind the ' conscious clubbing ' movement claim that a dance - based , totally clean wake - up call is the most fun way to work out and get endorphins flowing			0
' on the day , after a slow - ish start where the amount of harem pants and bongos had me worried that the sober scene was a little too alternative for me , my friends and i surprised ourselves by really getting into the swing of things			0
' by 8am the dance floor was packed with glamorous young ( ish ) men and women raving their heads off to noughties dance anthems and the crowd seemed better looking than average ( which was probably more to do with the fact they were at the start of their day not the end rather than the non-drinking aspect ) , everyone had a big grin on their faces , and we worked up a real sweat bouncing around			0
' one problem with morning raving ( sober or drunk ) is trying to make yourself office appropriate in a nightclub loo			0
and i 'm not sure @entity186 would work at the weekend if trying to compete with real booze - addled after parties			0
but it 's definitely a fun way to work out , and a great excuse to wear sequins before 9am			0

bar will be stocked with range of alcohol - free champagne , beer and cocktails
drunk people will be refused entry on the door of @entity2 club night
brainchild of @entity0 , 40 , who wants to change way we socialise
