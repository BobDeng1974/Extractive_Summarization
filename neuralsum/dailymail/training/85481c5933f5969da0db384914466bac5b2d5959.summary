by @entity0 published : 16:39 est , 3 october 2013 updated : 03:28 est , 4 october 2013 a rising number of children are using portable tablet computers to access the internet without adult supervision , say experts			2
the use of handheld devices such as @entity9 by under - 15s tripled in the past year , sparking fears they are able to bypass parental safety filters by using public wireless networks			1
a report by media watchdog @entity15 revealed that 42 per cent of children now use tablets , up from 14 per cent last year , while 28 per cent of children aged three and four use the devices at home			1
fears : the three-fold rise in the number of children using tablet computers has sparked concerns they will be able to bypass security filters ( file picture ) the study also found that fewer parents have internet security measures installed on their household computers than last year , with just 43 per cent enabling ‘ safe search ’ settings on their browsers			1
campaigners warned that parents are struggling to keep up with their offspring ’s use of technology , meaning they are less able to protect them from online dangers			2
the statistics support the @entity45 ’s campaign for internet service providers to be forced to block unsafe material , with over- 18s able to access adult material only following a strict age check			0
alarming : survey by @entity15 revealed only 43 % of parents had installed ' safe searches ' on their home computers ( file picture ) the government has agreed a compromise solution , under which all new broadband contracts will have filters turned on and existing customers will be prompted to make a decision about their service			1
@entity62 , co-chairman of @entity63 , said yesterday : ‘ @entity15 ’s figures show the problem of dealing with the internet is still growing			1
‘ parents have still not been able to catch up with their children ’s technology skills and protect them adequately			2
‘ children who use tablets are more easily able to use public wi - fi			1
instead of sitting at the family pc they can just go to the local park or café			0
and lots of public wi - fi is unfiltered , meaning they can access whatever they want			2
’ she said she recognised the problems faced by parents			0
‘ the way children access the internet is getting more complex , and more difficult to monitor , ’ said @entity82			0
in a survey of 2,374 parents , @entity15 found that 64 per cent believed their online safety measures were effective			1
but half admitted their children knew more about the internet than them			0
the report also found that children aged 12 to 15 have never met almost a third of the ‘ friends ’ on social networking sites , opening them to the risk of grooming and bullying			0
on average , teenagers said they had 272 online friends , but had never met 78 of them			0
a third allowed their pages to be viewed by strangers , up from 22 per cent last year			0
the @entity15 report warned : ‘ children with a social networking site profile that may be visible to people not known to them are more likely to have undertaken some kind of potentially risky online behaviour , such as adding people to their contacts they do n’t know in person , or sending them photos or personal details			1
