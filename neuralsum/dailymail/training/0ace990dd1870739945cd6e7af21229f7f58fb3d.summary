@entity44 , who flew in from @entity45 , told the @entity46 : ' i 've just come back via @entity48 and our flight was met by an airport official saying we might be screened			0
' he even shook our hands			2
that 's something nobody does now in @entity45 and infected countries , you have to learn not to			0
' he said officials in @entity45 airports were much more organised about making sure the infection did not spread			2

' ebola virus disease is not spread through intact skin , or by ordinary social contact , such as shaking hands or sitting next to someone			1
people who are well are not at risk of transmitting the virus			2
' however , we have advised @entity13 staff responsible for screening people from countries with endemic @entity75 to not shake their hands			1
' this is because they are travelling from a high risk area and therefore extra precaution must be taken			1
this is covered within the training which all staff undertaking screening are being given			2
' however this does not change our public health advice to members of the public , which remains the same			0
' the spokesman added : ' if there is physical contact between screening staff and passengers on occasion – such as a handshake or through temperature checking – this does not present any significant health risk			1
' @entity13 has also been working closely with @entity6 management teams to review advice to a range of airport staff			2

@entity77 , 32 , who flew in from @entity45 , said : ' if you are going to make the effort and take this measure , you might as well make it compulsory			0
i could have @entity75 and i could have walked straight through			0
' passengers arriving from @entity11 from high risk areas are being subject to screening at @entity6			0
they are being asked to complete a questionnaire asking about their current health and where they have come from			0
