@entity1 's win over @entity2 was an ill - tempered affair and was notable for both teams trying to stop the other side ’s @entity5			0
@entity7 and @entity8 were both targeted			1
you could see the teams almost using a ‘ rotational fouling ’ tactic			1
players would put in a tackle on the star man and then let somebody else make the next one			0
by taking it in turns , it becomes less obvious to the referee when players accumulate fouls			2
attacked : @entity7 ( left ) and @entity8 were consistently fouled by opposition players tough : @entity8 is tackled by @entity24 , who marshaled him for the entire game on friday out of action : @entity1 's team doctor @entity27 said @entity7 will be out for four - to - six weeks video we 'll cope with @entity31 - @entity30 @entity1 's game against @entity2 set the tournament record for fouls with 54 , with @entity7 and @entity8 coming in for rough treatment			1
@entity7 in particular was the victims of ‘ rotational fouling ’ - where players take it in turns to foul the opposition			1
it worked a treat too , none of the culprits were booked			0
and @entity2 were n’t the only ones to target @entity47 shared tackling duties over 90 minutes in their last 16 tie			0
@entity7 v @entity52 v @entity51 4mins @entity56 27mins @entity55 29mins @entity54 40mins @entity53 it ’s not a common tactic , but it would not be unusual for teams to have that in their locker			1
with somebody like @entity7 , it becomes easier to get away with cumulative fouls because he pops up all over the pitch			1
a defender can be more physical , knowing it ’s unlikely that they will come into contact with @entity7 again soon			2
in that quarter - final the referee seemed to have left his cards at home			0
because of that leniency , we have been denied the chance to watch the brilliance of @entity7			2
@entity8 came in for similar treatment and took more evasive action than @entity7 , who looked to stay on his feet			1
i wondered how long it would take for @entity24 to get booked , but the card never came			0
instead it was @entity8 himself who was cautioned after just one foul			2
referees have a duty to protect players			0
they seem to be more lenient in this tournament and so it has become possible to stop the stars with clever tactical fouling			0
rotation : players from both sides seemed to take it in turns to foul the number 10s appeals : @entity8 asks for a free - kick after clashing with @entity24 during the first half @entity102 ready to fill @entity7 's boots			1

@entity7 and @entity8 were targeted in a ' rotational fouling ' tactic
easier to get away with *cumlative* fouls on @entity7 as he pops up everywhere on the field so players can rotate the fouling
@entity8 fouled consistently but was booked after only one *indiscretion*
