by @entity0 published : 10:23 est , 4 september 2012 updated : 05:30 est , 5 september 2012 welfare agencies missed 50 chances to save a toddler who died from a methadone overdose after social workers failed to take him into care , a damning report has revealed			1
@entity8 , who was just a month short of his second birthday , was found dead in his parents ’ bed after overdosing on the heroin substitute in august last year			1
the toddler , who was given the drug to sedate him , lived with his crack cocaine and heroin - addicted parents @entity16 and @entity19 in a filthy flat in the @entity22 area of @entity23			1
a serious case review , commissioned by @entity25 , found there were more than 50 ' missed opportunities ' by professional agencies to intervene which began even before he was born			0
he was just a month short of his second birthday when he was found dead before his birth there were concerns that @entity40 was regularly injecting heroin while also taking methadone during the pregnancy			0
following his birth he became subject of a child protection plan but that was discontinued			0
a second child protection plan was commenced but moves to take @entity8 into care were never initiated , the review said			2
during this time @entity8 and @entity40 continued to use heroin and methadone and were also were falsifying regular urine tests			1
they pair later admitted they ' knew the tricks to get around screening '			0
the report also found that there was a lack of co-operation from @entity8 ’s parents with all involved in dealing with them			1
this included drug agencies , midwifery , housing , health visitors , social workers and there were also regular failures to keep appointments or be at home when visits were made			0
the report stated : ' what was lacking was the authoritative challenge to this lack of co-operation , there was a lack of enforcement of consequences			2
there was a lack of challenge by practitioners across the range of agencies			0
' the report , which referred to @entity8 as ' @entity88 ' throughout , continued : ' the extent of the parents ’ lack of engagement , avoidance and dishonesty grew over time and although this was recognised by practitioners there was insufficient challenge by professional and no sustained , planned approach to protecting the child			1
failures : @entity8 pictured with his father @entity16			1
the report into his death stated that the extent of the parents ’ lack of engagement , avoidance and dishonesty grew over time but professionals did n't challenge this ' the only way that @entity88 ’s death would definitely have been prevented was if he had been placed away from his parents			1
' the opportunity to do this was lost due to the failure to follow through on the initiation of care proceedings			0
however , a better - planned and authoritative approach to the family may also have prevented his death			1
' it was revealed today that @entity8 suffered two head injuries - one at seven weeks and one at 11 weeks - and his parents gave the same explanation			1
the report stated that this should have raised concerns that the injuries were not accidental			0
the boy also sustained injuries to his face at 21 and 23 months old and again the same explanations were given when he was seen by medical professionals			0
@entity40 , 35 , and @entity8 , 33 , were accused of killing their son by giving him the drug that they were both prescribed by doctors			2
prison : mother @entity19 , 35 , with her son who was convicted of child cruelty and was jailed for four years tribute : a @entity145 message posted by @entity16 after the death of his son			1
he was convicted of manslaughter and causing cruelty to a child and jailed for nine years at @entity151 after a three week trial at @entity151 , @entity8 was convicted of manslaughter and causing cruelty to a child and jailed for nine years			1
the jury cleared @entity40 of manslaughter but convicted her of child cruelty and causing or allowing the death of a child			0
she was jailed for four years			2
the trial heard that there were bags of rubbish lying around their one - bedroom ground floor rented flat , as well as drug paraphernalia kept in cupboards and crack pipes under the sink			1
@entity169 rolled up cigarette was found in a child ’s cot and there were also dirty potties			0
both his parents were prescribed methadone and scientific tests showed the fatal dose administered to @entity8 was not the first time he had been given the drug			1
addicted : @entity40 , 35 , left , and @entity8 , 33 , right , were accused of killing their son by giving him methadone that they were both prescribed by doctors			2
@entity8 was convicted of manslaughter and @entity40 child cruelty during the trial the court heard that several different agencies were monitoring @entity8 and @entity40 in caring for their son but they were able to pull the wool over their eyes			1
' @entity19 and @entity16 were aware that health care professionals , drug workers as well as social services were monitoring their behaviour as well as trying to help them , ' prosecutor @entity193 told jurors			1
' they created an image with those professionals that they were looking after @entity8			0
of course nobody knew they were giving methadone to @entity8			2
' while both of them cared about @entity8 , he was not their priority			0
they were drug addicts , whose need for drugs came before @entity8			2
' death : the report said that @entity8 's parents created an image with professionals that they were looking after him but no one knew they were giving him methadone			1
it said their need for drugs came before him prof @entity221 also called on the government to publish guidance on the testing of children for methadone			0
' one of the issues we are grappling with is when methadone is being prescribed , it is not being misused , ' he said			0
' in particular not being used as a tranquilliser or sedative with children			0
' prof @entity221 added : ' we are looking for the government to determine what ought to be the national position in relation to the testing of children			0
' @entity240 , the city council ’s strategic director for children and young people ’s services , said : ' @entity245 fully accepts the recommendations made in the serious case review into the tragic death of @entity8			2
' the administering of methadone to @entity8 was a deliberate act and one for which the parents are now serving a custodial sentences			1
@entity8 with is father @entity16			1
@entity245 said at the time of his death there was no evidence of immediate risk to the child and it would have acted immediately had it known he was being given methadone ' however , at the time of his death there was no evidence of immediate risk to @entity8			1
' with hindsight , if we had known he was being given methadone , we would have acted immediately to place him away from harm			0
' many of the recommendations outlined in the findings of the report have already been implemented , including a new working group on substance misuse , revised guidance and protocol for practitioners , a review of services for drug - using patients and arrangements for prescribing methadone			2
' two events to improve and strengthen communications are under way			0
' our legal team has introduced new guidelines on how legal advice is given and improved monitoring of the progress of cases			0
