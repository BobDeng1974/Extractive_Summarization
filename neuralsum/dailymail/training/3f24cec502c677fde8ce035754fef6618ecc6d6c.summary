a group of residents furious at @entity3 shoppers clogging up their street are issuing fake parking tickets to ward them off			1
they have even placed mock permits in a number of car windscreens along @entity10 , @entity11 , and put up signs warning drivers of the ' parking restrictions '			1
motorists who park in the street illegally will be slapped with a ' ticket ' which politely tells them it is against the law to park there			1
families living in the access only road in @entity23 became so fed up with the parking war that they were given yellow ' parking permits ' to hand to visitors			1
a group of residents furious at @entity3 shoppers clogging up their street are issuing fake parking tickets and putting up signs to ward them off motorists who park illegally in @entity10 , @entity11 , will be slapped with a ' ticket ' which politely tells them it is against the law to park there but these were not sanctioned by any official parking authority			1
both the police and the county council have confirmed that no such laws are in place and said they would not be enforcing any parking law in the area			1
but @entity42 , chairman of the local resident 's association , has said ' something radical has to be done '			0
he said : ' we did make the permits up ourselves and we do put polite notices on cars illegally parked			1
they have even placed mock permits in a number of car windscreens along the only - access road ' this is merely an attempt to discourage people from parking here			2
we did have a sign up by the green but the council said it was illegal and it was taken down			2
' we do have other signs up			0
i think the wider issue is the lack of parking in @entity11			1
something radical has to be done			0
' the council and the police are both right but it is illegal to park in an ' access only ' area			2
it used to be enforced by the traffic wardens before the council took over and the wardens encouraged us to set up our own scheme			2
it worked for a few years then stopped			0
the police enforced it for a while and then got fed up			0
one resident , who did not wish to be named , has branded the parking ' permits ' a ' joke ' and was unhappy that it was pulling the wool over the public 's eyes			2
he said : ' i came across the permit when i moved into the house – it had been left behind by the previous owner			0
as soon as i saw it i thought it could n't be serious – it seemed like a bit of a joke			0
' it 's the attempt to mislead the general public that it 's some form of ' official ' document which bothers me as it 's quite clearly a fabrication			0
' what 's the point of having the permits when they 're completely meaningless anyway ? it seems to me that it 's a minority of busybodies trying to impose their will unlawfully on the rest of the community			0
@entity42 , chairman of the local resident 's association , has said ' something radical has to be done ' ' what also annoys me is the attempt to make it look pseudo-official , which means when a relative comes to stay they feel as though they ca n't even park near my home			0
' a spokesman for the county council , which enforces parking laws in the city , said : ' there is no council managed residents ' parking permit scheme on @entity10			1
' this is an access only road which is enforced by the police			0
we and the police have met with the residents but there was no clear consensus about being part of a council run permit scheme			1
' a @entity141 police spokesman said : ' if there was an official parking permit sign or restrictions in the street we would enforce them			2

*disgruntled* residents have set up their own parking scheme with permits
they issue ' tickets ' and put up signs warning drivers not to park illegally
families living in @entity10 , @entity11 , also hand out visitor permits
police and county council said there were no such law in place there
