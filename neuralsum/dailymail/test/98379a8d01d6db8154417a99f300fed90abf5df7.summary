@entity1 students who smoke cannabis can expect to get lower grades across the board but especially if they are studying maths , a new study has revealed			1
statistics collected at @entity1 in @entity8 , where cannabis is decriminalised , have shown that students who were able to buy the drug from coffee shops were five percent less likely to pass their courses			1
at the same time , foreign students who did not have ready access to the mind bending drug did better on average , the @entity15 reported			1
the study will rankle with the increasing number calling for the legislation of cannabis around the world economists @entity27 from the @entity28 and @entity29 of @entity30 made their findings based on what happened in @entity33 in 2011 when the city let only @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38 nationals have access to its 13 coffee shops , where cannabis was sold			1
the restriction was put in place to combat drug tourism which was thought to be tarnishing the city ’s image			0
tourists particularly from @entity47 and @entity48 were visiting @entity49 solely to smoke cannabis			0
@entity50 and @entity51 studied the 54,000 sets of grades from students all around the world and came to a stark conclusion			0
in a paper recently unveiled at the @entity60 conference in @entity61 the economists showed plainly that those without easy access to the drug did better in their studies on average			1
the temporary prohibition constrained consumption amongst the @entity69 , @entity37 and @entity38 nationals and their brain function improved			0
students who were able to buy the drug from coffee shops were five percent less likely to pass their courses @entity50 was quoted as saying the difference was found to be similar to those observed in the @entity77 when students reach legal drinking age			1
the change before and after restriction was seen to be even more pronounced amongst ‘ low achievers ’			0
without access to cannabis they had a 7.6 percent chance of passing the courses			2
the pair also came to stark conclusions when looking at stats for maths students			1
for those courses numerical skills the policy effect was ‘ five times larger ’			2
for those stuying courses with numerical skills the policy effect was ‘ five times larger ’ , the @entity1 ( pictured ) study stark concluded while there is increasing clamour for the legalisation of cannabis across the world , the economists say there is very little evidence of how the drug – which has been linked to psychosis – affects society			1
coffee shops may start to spring up in @entity110 with @entity111 planning to be the first country to fully legalise the drug			0
the drug study says : ‘ if marijuana is legalised like it is in many states in the @entity77 , we should at least inform consumers about the negative consequences of their drug choices			2
’ consuming @entity121 – tetrahydrocannabinol – the active ingredient in @entity124 is much the same as drinking pure vodka it concludes			0
@entity50 , a father , said the study has informed how he advises his own 13 - year - old son , about cannabis and he shares the findings as a precautionary measure			0
the economists say there is little evidence of how the drug , linked to psychosis , affects wider society			2

study at @entity1 found access to drug lowered grade scores
those who could buy cannabis legally did 5 *%* worse across all courses
statistics were worst for maths students or those developing number skills
economists say more to be done to *investigate* the drug *'s* affect on society
