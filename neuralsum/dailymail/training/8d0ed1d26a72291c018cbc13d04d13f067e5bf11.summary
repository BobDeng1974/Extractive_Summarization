by @entity0 published : 06:43 est , 4 march 2014 updated : 08:22 est , 4 march 2014 superfit @entity2 is on a mission to break down the stereotype of a typical beauty queen - and she 's using brute force to do it			1
the stunning 21 year - old has qualified for the @entity8 as a weightlifter - while also competing in beauty pageants			2
@entity2 , a full - time pe teacher , from @entity11 says she is passionate about changing the image of women by taking part in two very contrasting roles			1
beauty queen @entity2 is set to be a weightlifter at this summer 's commonwealth games she said : ' i hope that because i 'm so far from the stereotypical beauty queen , young people will realise that the way to get the body you want is n't through starving yourself			1
' i also like that one breaks the stereotype of the other , as people think female weightlifters should be really butch looking and beauty queens should be tall , blonde and rake thin			1
' it shows you do n't have to be manly to enjoy the sport and you do n't have to be skinny to be a beauty queen			2
they 're both great fun and anyone can do it			0
' i hope that my training as a weightlifter will help people realise that beauty @entity2 , who competes as a beauty queen has now landed the chance to enter the commonwealth games as a weighlifter pageants have come a long way since the 1970s because i think outside of the pageant community , a lot of people think they are still really outdated			1
' since i started , my arms hardly look any different because you use the strength in your legs and bum			0
' i also hope that my success in pageants will encourage more girls to take up weightlifting			0
' it 's very important in pageants now to have a healthy body and active lifestyle and not to have a stick - thin , starved figure we used to see			2
" @entity2 , a former @entity67 @entity11 , qualified for this summer 's @entity8 in @entity68 after totalling 190kg with a 83kg snatch and 107kg clean and jerk in the @entity71			1
@entity2 says she wants to challenge the perceptions of beauty queens @entity2 lifted her way to a place in this summer 's commonwealth games she is also set to take part in the @entity78 in november in @entity79 - while having her sights on the @entity83 @entity82 crown on march 9			1
commonwealth games hopeful @entity2 is more used to strutting her stuff in beauty pageants @entity2 , from @entity11 , already holds the regional miss @entity88 title and winning the @entity82 crown would see her go to the final in @entity92 in august			1
@entity2 trained as a gymnast from the age of five and got into weightlifting first , thanks to boyfriend @entity96 , who came 10th in the sport during the @entity98			2
she said : ' it was september 2011 and @entity96 suggested i go to the gym and try some weightlifting for a bit of fun and that i may be quite good at it because of my gymnastics background			0
' during my first ever training sessions i managed a scrappy looking 30kg snatch and an even worse looking 40kg clean and jerk			0
' i 'm quite a competitive person and i like being able to challenge and beat myself , therefore weightlifting was perfect for me and i fell in love with it straight away			0
' she might seem a big softie here but @entity2 's set to become a weightlifting champ her first foray onto the catwalk came in march 2012 when she won miss @entity11 as a student in the city			1
at the moment she spends 20 hours a week training for weightlifting while also preparing for the required charity events in the @entity83 @entity82 event			0
@entity2 is currently working as a supply teacher at @entity129 in @entity11 , @entity130			1
@entity2 will be swapping floor length gowns for @entity133 weightlifting gear she added : ' it can be hectic trying to fit everything but i am lucky that the timing of the school day means i can fit everything in at the best time for me			0
' schools are usually supportive as they like to have an elite athlete as a teacher to be a role model to the pupils			0
' @entity2 said her weightlifting helped her land the @entity67 @entity11 title as she had something different to offer , and other girls in the competition come to her for advice on exercise			2
she said : ' weightlifting has toned up my body and i 'm in much better shape now i 've been training			0
' i think that 's really helped with the beauty pageants i 've been in , especially with the swim suit rounds			0
' i absolutely love doing both and it 's great that they work well together , even if it is an unusual mix. ' bosses at @entity164 have also recruited @entity2 to raise the profile of the sport .			2
