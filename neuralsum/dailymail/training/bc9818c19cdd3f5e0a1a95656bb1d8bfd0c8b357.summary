by @entity0 talented musician : @entity2 , 48 , received psychiatric help only weeks before the trial a concert violinist was urged by police not to seek counselling before she gave evidence in court against a choirmaster who sexually abused her as a teenager - in case it altered her memory , a coroner heard today			1
the inquest into the death of @entity2 - who died of an overdose - was told that the talented musician increasingly struggled to cope with depression and anxiety in the year ahead of the trial of ex-choirmaster @entity22			1
mrs @entity2 died at her home in @entity24 , @entity25 , in january 2013 , just a week after giving evidence in court about the historic sexual abuse , which came to light when her friend reported it to @entity30 two years earlier			1
known as @entity31 , she was aged just 14 and 15 at the time of the abuse			1
the mother - of - four had regular meetings with her gps , who eventually referred her to the local health authority @entity25 and @entity41 ’s @entity40 after she took multiple overdoses , @entity34 heard today			2
but two overdoses in october and december 2012 preceded the first meeting the 48 - year - old had with a psychiatrist on december 19 of that year - just weeks before she would have to face her abuser at @entity48			2
she had been in hospital at least four times for treatment following overdoses before health services regarded her as high risk			0
her gp @entity56 , of @entity57 , @entity24 , said mrs @entity2 ’s anxiety stemmed from the impending court appearance and they were both frustrated with delays in getting psychiatric help			1
difficulties : mrs @entity2 ( left ) increasingly struggled to cope with depression and anxiety in the year ahead of the trial of ex-choirmaster @entity22 ( right ) ‘ four months before the trial , @entity31 wanted something pragmatic , something here and now that related more to the court case than her past experiences , ’ mrs @entity56 said			1
‘ it was becoming more and more difficult for her as that approached			0
in our conversation on december 10 we were both frustrated			0
we could not understand what was taking so long - she needed help			0
‘ it had been five or six weeks since the referral and she still did not have a care co-ordinator - it was a month to the court case and it was important @entity31 had this therapy			2
’ ' she said [ the ] police did n’t not feel she should have counselling in case it interfered with her memories of the events and could obstruct the criminal case ' dr @entity94 the inquest heard she again tried to take her own life on january 3 , 2013			2
dr @entity94 , also of @entity98 ’s , was mrs @entity2 ’s gp in 2011 when she first reported anxiety over the abuse and said she took several overdoses after the press first reported the case in mid- 2012			1
dr @entity105 said : ‘ i remember this consultation like it was yesterday because it was so unusual			0
mrs @entity2 came in and immediately burst into tears			1
history : @entity22 taught at the prestigious @entity109 in @entity110 ( pictured ) before going on to direct the @entity111 ‘ i remember sitting there for a couple of minutes in silence and let her cry and offered her tissues			2
then she found the confidence to speak and told me what it was all about			0
mrs @entity2 allegedly said she felt as though she had been the one on trial during cross-examination by her abuser 's counsel @entity122 ( above ) ‘ it was about the fact historical sexual abuse acts she had shut away for many years had been reopened			1
i remember her feeling helpless , she did n’t know what to do			0
‘ i remember it was not her choice			0
it had been reopened by a friend of hers who had reported it to the police and the police had contacted her			0
i remember her saying it not had been her choice to have this case reopened			0
’ he told the inquest he started seeing her fortnightly , adding : ‘ i broached with her the offer of a psychiatric referral but she was resistant to that			0
‘ she said the reason why was the police did n’t not feel she should have counselling in case it interfered with her memories of the events and could obstruct the criminal case			0
‘ i felt her mental health was more important than the criminal case , but she was not persuaded			0
’ on monday mrs @entity2 ’s husband @entity156 , 59 , said in his evidence that his wife told him she felt as though she had been the one on trial during cross-examination by her abuser ’s counsel @entity122			1
@entity22 , who taught at the prestigious @entity109 in @entity110 before going on to direct the @entity111 , was later stripped of his obe for music services after being jailed for six years for five counts of indecent assault			2
in april , a serious case review by @entity167 said mrs @entity2 ’s death ‘ could and should ’ have been prevented and mental health services failed to recognise she was vulnerable as she made repeated suicide bids			1
her death led to calls for the court system to improve how sexual abuse victims are treated			1
the inquest is scheduled to run into next week .			2
