last updated at 1:41 pm on 2nd december 2011 @entity0 has had its first major redesign since @entity2 bought the site - and it 's clearly aimed at making the video site more ' tv - like '			1
it 's now easier to find ' channels ' from the front page , with a black navigation menu on the left hand side which allows users to organise channels , rather than simply search for video using @entity2 search			1
' more and more , behind every great video is a great channel , ' said @entity0 via its official blog			0
new look : the new look gathers ' channels ' in the black navigation bar on the right hand side of the page making it more like @entity2 's homepage three billion videos are viewed on @entity0 every day			1
@entity2 is attempting to ' shift ' the way people use the site , with the increased focus on ' channels ' a clear attempt to mirror services offered by tv stations			1
it also ensures that users are logged in via a @entity2 account			2
the new look for @entity0 mirrors the redesign announced earlier this week of @entity2 's home page			1
professional approach : advertisers prefer not to be next to user - generated content so earlier this year , @entity0 announced a range of professionally produced channels from celebrities such as @entity45 ' with our announcement last month that more channels are coming to @entity0 , we want to make it easier for you to find and keep tabs of what you want to watch , ' said the company via an announcement on the official @entity2 blog			2
the final @entity0 look comes after @entity2 unveiled an experimental design in july called @entity58 and used feedback from users to establish the finished appearance			1
according to their official blog @entity2 believe the new design provides a ' simpler @entity0 , with a consistent grey background , bigger video thumbnails and a more streamlined watch page			2
' @entity2 also aims to offer more professional content on the site - and , as usual , everything will be free , supported by the internet giant 's advertising system			2
' @entity74 ' channels allow users to earn a percentage by signing up for @entity2 's ' partner ' programme , where they earn some of the advertising revenue generated by the site			1
but @entity0 will also offer professional content			0
the changes follow a move earlier this year when the site launched 100 new professionally produced tv channels in partnership with stars such as singer @entity45 and actor @entity88			0
the move is designed to turn @entity0 - already available via many internet tvs - into a rival to cable and satellite tv channels			0
owner @entity2 says that the channels will be on - demand services , each offering 25 hours of programming a day			1
the arrangement should work in @entity0 's favour when it comes to advertising			0
many big - ticket advertisers are relucant to be seen alongside ' user - generated ' videos , and would be happier with professionally produced , star - studded content			0
@entity0 is said to be paying up to $ 100million to producers to take part , and up to $ 5million per channel			0
the money is an advance on advertising money - @entity2 will recoup its portion first before splitting the proceeds			0
@entity2 also aims to make the site more ' social ' - even allowing users to share via @entity115 , rather than their own , less popular @entity116			2
' you can even link your @entity0 account to @entity120 and @entity115 to see what your friends are sharing , ' said @entity0 .			0

new design brings it in line with owner @entity2 's look
users can now organise their favourite channels
