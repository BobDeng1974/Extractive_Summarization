@entity1 winner @entity0 admits missing the @entity2 was actually a blessing in disguise on a personal level			1
it was not so much avoiding another @entity8 defeat as the fact it meant he could spend time at home following the birth of his first child			1
@entity0 's final three finishes of last season were second , first , first as he claimed the 10 million dollar ( Â£ 6.2million ) @entity1 first prize but he was just too late for selection on to @entity21 's team			1
that prevented him having to make a difficult decision as his daughter @entity24 was born just two days ' after he won the @entity25			1
@entity0 poses with the @entity1 after his victory at the @entity27 in @entity28 in september @entity0 , in action with @entity30 ( right ) , during the final round of the @entity25 ' if i happened to be chosen we ( he and his wife @entity34 ) were going to see what our doctors recommended , whether they could induce early or anything , ' said @entity0 , speaking ahead of his first start of the new season at the @entity40 in @entity41			1
' but it was a blessing in disguise			2
i loved it that she ( @entity24 ) came when she did and that i was n't picked because i was home for two weeks and i got to be with her for four weeks total			0
' those are four weeks early in her life that i 'm happy i could be a part of because i 'm going to miss a lot of weeks , unfortunately , with playing golf			0
it meant more to me than it did to her			0
' having watched the @entity2 defeat at @entity57 on television @entity0 admits the @entity8 side has reached the point where something drastic has to be done			1
' like every @entity8 i think we 're sort of tired of it			2
we 're at a breaking point , and that 's what you saw , ' he added			2
' you saw some players ( referring to @entity70 's open criticism of @entity21 's captaincy ) that were frustrated and all they wanted to do was vent a little bit			1
' i think that the process needs to change			0
i 've been a little hard on the @entity76 but i feel like they need to do a better job than what they have done already			0
' @entity0 hits a shot from the fairway during the final round of the @entity84 at @entity85 @entity0 finished last season with 12 successive sub- 60 rounds and despite his new - found success he has no plans to alter his approach			2
' obviously with being the @entity1 champion you can have expectations soar but that 's not going to change , ' he added			2
' i 'm just going to keep that same mental approach			0
i do n't expect anything less , i do n't expect anything more from myself with being a @entity1 champion			0
' i 'm just going to have the same expectations i 've had ever since i started playing this game			0
' i 'm going to keep getting better			0
i 'm going to keep working hard , and if i just keep making small strides at improving in this game then hopefully everything else will take care of itself - that 's the way it did at @entity107 and @entity25			1
