by @entity0 published : 08:37 est , 4 march 2014 updated : 09:04 est , 4 march 2014 the first ever drag show performed at a @entity4 military base was hailed as a resounding success over the weekend - but predictably , some were outraged			1
on saturday , six gay , straight and lesbian servicemen and women slapped on the makeup to dance and lip - sync their way through hits such as ' @entity14 ' at the @entity15 at @entity16 in @entity17 to raise money for the military 's largest @entity20 nonprofit advocate			1
expecting to sell only 75 tickets , the organizers welcomed 400 people to the show , which has been criticized by former @entity26 congressman @entity26 , who attacked the @entity27 for worrying about ' hair and makeup for our gay military ' while @entity32 overwhelms the @entity33			2
scroll down for @entity34 on stage : one of the drag performers lip - syncs to their song during saturdays ' variety show ' performance at @entity16 in @entity17 , @entity41 before : the drag show was the first ever time that a performance of its kind has been seen at a @entity4 military base ever the historic event , the first since the 2011 repeal of @entity51 , is a step forward for the military which has hosted gay marriage ceremonies and dinners for @entity20 servicemen and women , but never a drag show			1
on saturday night , the @entity15 club was rammed for performances by serving members with stage names such as @entity63 and @entity64			2
the event ’s sole lesbian performer took the drag king name @entity68			2
raising money for the @entity17 chapter of @entity72 , the group were stunned weeks ago when the event starring drag kings and drag queens was approved - but as a ' variety show '			1
watch video here : popular : the organizers of the show feared that they would n't sell more than 100 tickets for the performance but they ended up with a packed house of 400 people pioneering : the show has been hailed as a huge success by the organizers and by those who attended who said that sexual orientation is not an issue in the military for servicemen and women the advocacy group agreed not to use the term ' drag show ' on the base , but those who attended were left in little doubt that it was			1
' we did n’t think there was much of a desire for an event like this on the island but it has actually blown up , ' said navy lt. @entity105 , co-chapter leader of @entity106 to @entity108 magazine			0
expecting less than 100 people to arrive , @entity109 was stunned when they sold 400 tickets in ten days			0
indeed , the unexpected success of the show highlights the changing attitudes within the military to its @entity20 members , as gay civil rights reach a pivotal moment across the nation - with many states passing laws legalizing marriage			2
former @entity4 congressman @entity26 attends the @entity124 in @entity125 in june - the @entity127 politician was scathing of the drag show put on in @entity17 over the weekend make - up : the show was weeks in the planning for the new @entity17 chapter of @entity72 , an advocacy organization for @entity133 in the @entity4 military it is also a huge moment for the @entity4 military			1
just three years ago , a gay , lesbian or drag performance on a military base would have been unthinkable and could have led to dismissal from the armed forces			1
but the repeals of @entity51 , as well as the @entity145 now mean that gay and lesbian people can be open about their sexuality and serve the military at the same time			2
however , all are not convinced by the openness the military is now beginning to display			0
former @entity127 congressman @entity26 said that he was ' kinda at a loss for words ' over the fundraiser for members of the military			0
on saturday , servicemembers on @entity17 were the first to take to the stage and perform as drag queens on a military installation in support of lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender troops songs : the show was a resounding success but carefully avoided any mentions of politics in a post on his website following the show , which @entity26 called , ' @entity176 in @entity177 in @entity17 ' , the politician seemed threatened and frightened for @entity4 's military past and future			1
annoyed that the show took place on @entity17 , ' the scene of one of the most ferocious and protracted battles of @entity183 - a site of legendary valor and sacrifice on the part of @entity4 soldiers ' , @entity26 was withering in his surmising of the show			1
' some @entity4 service personnel stationed in @entity17 today are treating the world to another kind of display : gay and lesbian service personnel performing in drag , to raise for their activities , to a sellout audience			1
' @entity26 goes as far to claim that the since the repeal of @entity51 , the rate of sexual assaults in the military and especially male - on - male sexual assaults has ' skyrocketed '			0
backing up @entity26 's scathing opinion of the show , @entity205 called the performance ' disgusting ' and went as far as to make very derogatory remarks regarding the performance			0
tech. sgt. @entity211 , who was among the crowd , said the show got a great reception and was important for civil rights			0
' everything is just accepted			0
it makes me really proud to watch it , ' @entity211 said			0
in the military , ' we are all brothers and sisters no matter what			0
