the women 's liberation movement did n't just change the role of women in society , it also helped transform what appeared on family dinner plates			1
food historian dr @entity7 told today 's @entity8 that in the @entity10 , only 20 per cent of women worked , leaving the majority of wives to spend their time cooking , cleaning and managing their households			1
but in later decades as women swelled the workforce , convenient pre-prepared sandwiches , microwaves and ready meals transformed @entity22 's kitchens - and its diet			1
@entity27 had to feed the family with limited rations thanks to households being rationed to one egg per week , cakes like this one , right , had to be made with dried eggs , left , while they were topped with blancmange thanks to the lack of sugar available the @entity39 family try making a @entity10 cake with limited ingredients on @entity43 show ' back in @entity44 ' , ably assisted by @entity45 she told presenters @entity46 and @entity48 : ' we have this idea of the @entity10 being a domestic ideal - @entity51 , glamorous - this was not the case in @entity22 , we were still in rationing , very austere			1
' it meant there was only one fresh egg a week per household so housewives had to feed the family with these limited rations			2
' it 's not surprising housewives became fed - up in the @entity10 - they spent 75 hours a week doing housework			2
' ' they had to cope with powdered eggs and a limited amount of variety to cook with			2
' a new @entity43 series called back in time for dinner challenged a modern family to try reliving what this was like			1
the @entity75 - father @entity76 , mother @entity77 and children @entity79 , 17 , @entity80 , 15 , and @entity81 - learnt that rations certainly made birthdays less indulgent			0
food historian dr @entity7 , pictured , took @entity46 and @entity48 on a trip down memory lane for the taste buds on today 's @entity8 , showing what was typically eaten from the @entity10 to nineties the @entity39 family took on a brave culinary challenge to eat as a family would have in every decade from the @entity10 to the @entity88			1
pictured , from left to right , @entity80 , 15 , mum @entity77 , @entity81 , 10 , dad @entity76 and @entity79 , 17 , in the @entity10 episode dr @entity94 invited @entity48 and @entity46 to try a birthday cake the family made on the show based on a @entity10 recipe			1
she explained : ' a cake had to be made with dry eggs and icing with a blancmange topping because of the lack of sugar			0
' after a taste test , @entity48 admitted it was ' dry but not inedible '			0
bread and dripping ( often leftover fat from the sunday roast ) was a common reality at breakfast time while fresh vegetables were often taken from community allotments			0
in the @entity114 , this morning illustrated how a typical food spread would include cheese and pineapples on cocktails sticks and corned beef			1
dr @entity94 revealed how this was the decade when kitchens were transformed by technology			0
she said : ' in the @entity114 there was a real rise in disposable incomes and an increase technology in the kitchen			0
in the @entity114 , food became more colourful and decorative , as shown by the cheese and pineapple sticks served on an orange and vibrant table cloth on today 's @entity8 the @entity135 ' @entity134 pictured with the @entity39 family as they sample the food of the @entity114 ' the most iconic piece is the fridge but only 50 per cent of households had one by the end of the decade , everyone else used larders			2
the fridge changed what you could cook			0
' the food historian added that food at this time became ' more about display and what it looks like as well as what it tastes like			1
' so along with the decorative pineapple and cheese on sticks served attached to an orange , came colourful dishes like vegetable terrines			0
by the @entity163 , 40 per cent of women were working , leading to a rise in the number of convenience foods on offer			1
dr @entity94 explained : ' now women have less time for cooking so the food industry starts offering help in terms of processed , convenience foods so there are things like @entity177 available			1
' there 's also more branding and colourful packaging to try and persuade people to buy them			0
' by the @entity163 , with more women going out to work , food is becoming more convenient with products like @entity186 , back left , and ready - made cake mixtures , back right @entity189 rolls and @entity177 became popular in the @entity163 as people spent less time cooking children of the @entity163 loved @entity193 , chocolate , strawberry and butterscotch flavours pictured iced fingers and ready - made @entity198 were the desserts of choice during this decade but every child 's favourite sweet treat was @entity193			1
the product was purchased as a powder so could be whipped up in seconds by time - strapped working mothers			0
such convenience foods became even more popular in the @entity208 as the number of women working increased again			2
' there was a more disposable income and less time so the ready - meal industry steps up and we get the microwave , ' dr @entity94 explained			0
in the @entity208 , the invention of the microwave led to a rise in ready - meals while pre-packed sandwiches , bottom right , appeared on shelves for the first time as workers wanted to grab lunch and go the @entity39 family , pictured in their 1980s - style kitchen which was all about convenience , with gadgets aplenty helping them to make meals she added that the pre-packed sandwich we take for granted today only came in to fruition in 1981 ' marking our changing relationship with time and leisure ' as people would rather grab lunch and go than do a home - made packed lunch			1
the first flavours for pre-packed sandwiches included cheese and pickle and tinned salmon and tomato			0
following the rise of convenience foods came concerns for health in the @entity88			2
but dr @entity94 admits this was a contradictory time , when the nation had a ' schizophrenic relationship with food '			2
while families tried to be healthier by opting for organic foods and aiming for their ' five - a - day ' they were also bombarded with high sugar , processed foods like @entity261 and mr @entity263 snack cakes			0
in the @entity88 , people became more health conscious opting for salad and organic foods but at the same time , high sugar , processed foods like @entity261 were introduced ' back in @entity44 ' is on @entity270 at 8pm			0
