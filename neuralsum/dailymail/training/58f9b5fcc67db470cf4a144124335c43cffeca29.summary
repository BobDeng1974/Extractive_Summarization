by @entity0 published : 10:22 est , 12 december 2013 updated : 11:21 est , 12 december 2013 a former @entity2 police officer who retired five years ago on a $ 2 million disability pension after accidentally firing a staple in his finger has been filmed using a gun at a shooting range			1
@entity8 , 34 , admits that the state 's retirement system is ' absurd ' but claims the video does not show his claim was fraudulent as he was using the hand that was not injured			1
despite his apparent good health , he collects $ 45,936.24 a year tax - free from an accidental - disability pension			1
if he lives to 80 , this will total at a $ 2 million cost to the taxpayer			0
in 2006 , he was stapling a target during a training session and accidentally shot the ring finger on his left hand , which is not the hand he shoots with			1
caught : @entity25 is pictured shooting at a driving range five years after he started receiving disability pension			1
he accidentally shot his hand with a staple gun and doctors said he was unable to return to work having fun : @entity8 , who said the video only shows him shooting with his strong hand , said he knows it looks ridiculous but that he has done everything within @entity38 's law he removed the staple , put on a bandage and continued the practice - but the following day he woke up with a swollen finger and filed an accident report			1
doctors concluded that he would not be able to apprehend or arrest a suspect or reliably shoot a weapon with the damaged hand , and recommended he be paid a disability pension			1
@entity8 , who was just 29 at the time , claims he asked to be switched to a desk job but he said officials told him he was not allowed to work with the police at all			1
' my career was taken away from me without any choice on my part , ' he told the @entity56			0
' i was an unwilling participant in all this drama			0
' @entity8 said he was initially approved for an ordinary pension , but in the wake of a @entity62 ruling , his lawyer told him he was eligible for accidental lifetime pension			0
' i was n’t the person who pushed the envelope , ' he said			0
' the only decision i made was to say , " okay , i will take that "			0
' @entity2 spokeswoman @entity69 would not comment on @entity8 's claim that he was told he could not work in any department			1
she told the @entity56 that ' our outside insurance doctors reviewed and processed mr. @entity8 's workman 's comp claim , ' but the decision was ' made exclusively ' by the pension board			2
despite the ruling , @entity8 , who has now moved states to near @entity79 , continues to shoot and visits ranges a few times a year - and he said he understands why that would annoy people			0
' it absolutely looks absurd , ' @entity8 said			0
' but it 's because the system is absurd			2
' his hobby emerged when the website @entity90 and @entity91 ran reports about a video @entity8 had posted on his @entity95 page showing him firing the @entity98 sniper rifle			0
battle : @entity8 says he told the @entity2 that he wanted to work a desk job but they refused disabled : he accidentally shot a staple into his left hand 's ring finger in 2006 and it became swollen			1
he said he does not think he 'd be able to shoot with it - although he would shoot with his right hand anyway he is seen gripping the gun and using his right hand - the stronger one			1
he then grins at the camera			0
his left hand shows no visible signs of damage but he said it is weaker and that he does not believe he could put handcuffs on someone			2
@entity8 , who now works for a loss - management company , pointed out that he does not use his weakened hand at all in the video			2
' i can honestly tell you : i followed the law , ' he said			2
' if people are upset about it , hang out outside the @entity123			0
do n’t hang out outside my house			0
' @entity125 , a member of the @entity38 @entity126 and @entity129 's @entity128 pension board , agreed that @entity8 had done nothing wrong and was simply playing with the system			2
following the rules : members of the pension board for the @entity126 ( file pictured ) said that more claims have been granted since they were told to consider injuries from slips and falls he added that @entity38 has seen a increase in the number of accidental pensions after the state @entity62 in 2007 and 2008 expanded the types of injuries that qualify			2
it now includes mental illness to injuries sustained from slips and falls			0
' this has to be the most expensive staple in the history of @entity38 , ' @entity151 from @entity90 told @entity152 ' the problem with the system is that it does n't differentiate between the guy who puts a staple in this hand and an officer who was shot in the line of duty and is in a wheelchair for the rest of his life			1

@entity165 , now 34 , admits that the ' system is absurd '
he retired on disability 5 years ago from @entity2 police after accidentally firing a staple into finger on his *non-shooting* hand
doctors said he would have trouble operating a *firearm* with the weak hand
@entity181 now shows him firing gun - but he claims it is above board because he is shooting with the hand that was not injured
believes the system is broken : ' i can honestly tell you , i followed the law '
