by @entity0 published : 08:24 est , 29 march 2012 updated : 08:24 est , 29 march 2012 the next @entity1 will be released at the end of 2013 - and will be capable of @entity4 resolutions far beyond most televisions today			1
the machine is known within @entity7 as ' @entity8 '			1
gaming blog @entity10 's unnamed source also reported , more controversially , that the new ' @entity8 ' console would refuse to play second - hand games			1
@entity1 : the timing is right for @entity7 to unveil a successor to the six - year - old console the leak , from an unnamed source speaking to the gaming blog @entity10 , is at least partially credible - with @entity21 set to unveil its next - generation @entity23 console this year , the timing is right			2
the new machine will be capable of playing games at extremely high resolutions up to 4096x2160 , @entity10 reports - far above the capabilities of most televisions today			1
that announcement also makes sense , as @entity32 has recently unveiled a television capable of the same ' @entity4 ' resolution , and other manufacturers are set to follow suit			1
it 's not clear whether the name @entity8 is a nickname , a codename , or the final name of the console			2
@entity43 was expected to show of a next - generation console at this year 's @entity46 gaming conference in @entity47 , until the company annnounced it would not be unveiling next - generation hardware			0
@entity21 will show off its ' next - generation ' @entity23 at the same conference			0
the new wii u console is said to be twice as powerful as @entity52 , and @entity21 has already shown off ia tablet - style controller with a built - in screen			0
@entity21 's @entity23 console builds on the motion - controls of its predecessor , but adds a secondary controller with a screen @entity21 's big franchises such as @entity62 remain exclusive to its consoles the report about the console refusing to play second - hand games is already controversial			1
several game companies , including the ' @entity69 ' giant @entity68 , have spoken out against the trade in second - hand console games - hoping instead for a pc - style system where gamers buy a ' code ' which allows them to install and use the software once			1
@entity77 analyst @entity76 says that the rumour of a ' block ' on second - hand games is highly unlikely - and that the move would lead to a backlash not just from gamers , but from retailers			1
' the anti-piracy rumors started in 2005 , when @entity86 patented a technology for it prior to the @entity1 launch , ' said @entity76 in an interview with @entity91			0
' today ’s rumor is just a re-hash of that old rumor and the recent one about the @entity96			0
it is n’t really in @entity7 ’s or @entity43 ’s best interests to block used games			2
' ' if @entity7 unilaterally did this , i could see @entity102 refusing to carry their console , and sales of the @entity105 would thereby suffer			2
on balance , it ’s a dumb idea , making it a dumb rumor			0
of course , you never know			0
' @entity76 said that he considered @entity10 's source to be ' a monkey ' .			0
