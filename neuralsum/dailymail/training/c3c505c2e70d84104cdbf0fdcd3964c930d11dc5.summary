judge @entity7 issued the ruling friday in the case of @entity10			2
@entity11 in @entity12 has been keeping @entity10 on life support against her family 's wishes			1
@entity10 was 14 weeks pregnant when her husband found her unconscious november 26 , possibly due to a blood clot			1
she 'd likely suffered an embolism that cut off oxygen to her brain			2
she was 14 weeks pregnant and has never regained consciousness questions : in @entity4 , state law stipulates that , in cases of pregnant women , @entity29 do not apply and all measures must be taken to save the life of the fetus @entity35 says he and his wife are paramedics who were clear that they did n't want life support in this type of situation			1
his attorney argued that keeping the woman alive would set a dangerous precedent			0
but @entity11 had argued that it had to protect the life of the unborn child			2
hospital officials have said they were bound by a state law prohibiting withdrawal of treatment from a pregnant patient			0
several experts interviewed by @entity0 have said the hospital is misapplying the law			0
the case has raised questions about end - of - life care and whether a pregnant woman who is considered legally and medically dead should be kept on life support for the sake of a fetus			1
it also has gripped attention on both sides of the abortion debate , with anti-abortion groups arguing @entity10 's fetus deserves a chance to be born			1
earlier this week , @entity35 's attorneys said that the fetus , now believed to be at about 22 weeks ' gestation , is ' distinctly abnormal			1
' they attorneys said they based that statement on medical records they received from the hospital			0
first child : @entity10 with her first baby			2
she was pregnant with her second when she collapsed in november the @entity81 district attorney 's office , which is representing the hospital in the lawsuit , said the hospital was expected to issue a statement later friday in response to the ruling			2
not much is known about fetal survival when mothers suffer brain death during pregnancy			0
@entity93 doctors who searched for such cases found 30 of them in nearly 30 years , according to an article published in the journal @entity97 in 2010			0
those mothers were further along in pregnancy - 22 weeks on average - when brain death occurred than in the @entity4 case			2
birth results were available for 19 cases			0
in 12 , a viable child was born			0
follow - up results were available for six , all of whom developed normally			0
@entity10 was hooked up to machines in a @entity12 hospital as her husband and the hospital were locked in a court battle about whether to retain life support			1
@entity35 said his wife , a fellow paramedic , was clear with him before he found her unconscious on november 26 : if she ever fell into this kind of condition , pull life support			1
@entity10 's attorneys , @entity119 and @entity120 , issued a statement wednesday describing the condition of the fetus , now believed to be at about 22 weeks ' gestation			1
@entity119 and @entity120 based their statement on medical records they received from the hospital			0
' according to the medical records we have been provided , the fetus is distinctly abnormal , ' the attorneys said			0
' even at this early stage , the lower extremities are deformed to the extent that the gender can not be determined			0
' the attorneys said the fetus also has fluid building up inside the skull and possibly has a heart problem			0
normal heartbeat : doctors previously said that the baby has a normal heartbeat and had the potential to be carried to full term happier times : above , @entity35 holds the couple 's one - year - old son @entity149			1
attorneys are now saying that the fetus carried by @entity10 is ' abnormal ' ' quite sadly , this information is not surprising due to the fact that the fetus , after being deprived of oxygen for an indeterminate length of time , is gestating within a dead and deteriorating body , as a horrified family looks on in absolute anguish , distress and sadness , ' the attorneys said			1
spokeswomen for the hospital and the @entity81 district attorney 's office , which is representing the hospital in the lawsuit , declined to comment wednesday			0
a hearing in the case is scheduled for friday			0
@entity10 's lawsuit asks a judge to order the hospital to pull life support and return @entity10 's body to her family			1
several experts have said the @entity178 does n't apply in this case because @entity10 , having suffered brain death , is legally and medically dead â € ” a key argument in @entity35 's lawsuit			1
@entity10 previously told the @entity0 he was n't confident about the health of the fetus			2
his wife was 14 weeks pregnant when he found her unconscious in november , possibly from a blood clot			2
a 2010 article in the journal @entity97 found 30 cases of brain - dead pregnant women over about 30 years			2
of 19 reported results , the journal found 12 in which a viable child was born and had post-birth data for two years on only six of them â € ” all of whom developed normally , according to the journal			0
i do n't agree with this law ' : @entity20 said he was unable to fulfill his promise to his wife because of the @entity4 law , which applies to all pregnant women , even those with do not resuscitate orders ' we knew what her wishes were ' : both @entity20 and @entity10 were both paramedics			1
he found her collapsed on november 26 and initiated @entity212 , but it was no use			1
@entity20 says the couple had seen enough in the line of duty to know they would n't want to be kept alive by machines unfortunately your browser does not support @entity221 .			0

the hospital had been keeping @entity10 alive against her family 's wishes
@entity35 of @entity12 , @entity4 , found his wife @entity21 on the kitchen floor on november 26
