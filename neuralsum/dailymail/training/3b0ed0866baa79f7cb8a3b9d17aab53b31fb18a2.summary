it is not perhaps what one would expect to find in a museum , but in @entity5 the humble burger and chips is an endangered item			1
the @entity8 's meal has spent the last year on display in @entity5 's national museum , after the final fast food outlet shut down in the country			1
now , the salty snack has gone one step further in becoming a historic item , going on display in a hostel - complete with a webcam so fans can document the food as it decays			0
and yes , it 's still in its original wrapper			0
@entity5 's economic crash in late 2008 ultimately led the global fast food chain to close their doors in the country			1
the last day that locals could pick up a @entity8 's burger was october 31 , 2009			2
one particularly forward - thinking man , @entity39 , went to @entity8 's the day before to pick up one of the final offerings - not to eat , but to keep on his garage shelf			0
the hostel has even set up a livestream - of the burger under glass - to allow fans to watch it rot and decay the fast foot chain exited @entity5 in october 2009 , following the country 's economic collapse after a year at the national museum , the burger recently - and inexplicably - moved to the hostel , where it is kept on display under glass			1
the property has also set up a livestream for those who ca n't make it to @entity26 to watch it rot and decay from anywhere in the world			2
it could be a slow process , however , as the livestream site warns that ' you will have to be patient to see any changes ' in its appearance .			0
