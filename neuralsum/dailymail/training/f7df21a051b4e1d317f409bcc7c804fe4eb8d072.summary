@entity1 will not be kept safer by keeping records on grandmothers visiting gardening websites , @entity0 warned today as he stepped up his attack on the new snooping powers			1
the deputy prime minister insisted the security services should have the right to ' break the privacy ' of people who ' seek to do us harm '			1

deputy prime minister @entity0 insisted the security services should have the right to ' break the privacy ' of people who ' seek to do us harm ' , but warned keeping vast records of web visits would not help the coalition is bitterly divided on the extent of surveillance powers needed to respond to terrorists using emerging technologies to avoid detection			1
the issue has re-emerged in the wake of the terror attacks in @entity41 which left 17 people dead			2
security services around the world face the challenge of how to keep track of extremists who use the internet to communicate			2
@entity15 has promised to revive legislation – blocked by the @entity50 – to ramp up internet surveillance powers to prevent terrorists from plotting atrocities online the so - called @entity54 would force internet and phone firms to store masses of information about emails , phone calls and internet @entity61 said yesterday : ' if i am prime minister , i will make sure we do not allow terrorists safe space to communicate with each other			1
' it raises the prospect of messaging apps like @entity71 and @entity72 being blocked			0
but mr @entity0 insisted that it was wrong to store every web site visit and social media interaction of every person			1
the @entity50 leader said the state should always ' retain the right to steam open envelopes , to listen to telephone conversations ' of those suspected of criminal or terrorist activity			0
but he said the @entity54 ' does cross a line ' and is ' not a proportionate response '			1
he told @entity88 's today programme : ' what it would do is say that you , every single person listening to this programme now , every website they visit over the last year , every social media interaction they have , will be stored by somebody			1
' @entity15 has promised to revive legislation – blocked by the @entity50 – to ramp up internet surveillance powers to prevent terrorists from plotting atrocities online he stressed that his opposition was not about letting terrorists communicate in the ' dark ' web '			1
' it 's about do i think that scooping up vast amounts of information on millions of people , children , grandmothers , grandparents , elderly people who are doing nothing more than visiting garden centre websites			2
' do i think that is a sensible use of our resources and our time ? ' does it address the issue which the agency quite rightly identifies , which is as technology mutates , as this globalised industry becomes more and more global how do we make sure that we continue to have the reach into those dark spaces so that terrorists can not hide from it			2
' the legislation , which was tabled in draft form by home secretary @entity134 in 2012 , would have extended the requirement for companies to retain phone and email data to include records - but not the content - of every individual 's internet browsing activity , including use of social media sites like @entity145 , internet gaming , and mobile phone messaging services			1
mr @entity15 yesterday said that as well as well as the @entity54 , new legislation will be required to enable the agencies to continue to intercept phone calls and access the content of electronic communications - on the basis of a warrant signed by the home secretary - when existing powers expire in 2016			1
in a speech tonight mr @entity0 will argue ' we do not make ourselves safer by making ourselves less free '			2
the @entity50 leader will also underline his party 's proposals for a @entity161 that would enshrine the right to free expression			0
' if we really believe freedom of speech is a founding principle of our democracy , then we must act to protect it , ' he will say			0
' i look enviously at @entity169 , where every schoolchild is taught from day one that they have inalienable rights - including free expression - which are a fundamental part of what it means to be @entity169			0
' i want us to have the same			0
the time has come for a written constitution with a @entity161			0
the @entity50 are committed to a constitutional convention after the general election , and deciding how we enshrine free speech in a @entity1 @entity161 should be at the heart of it			0
' we must always defend the @entity1 values of freedom , openness and tolerance			0
we must always defend the rights of individuals to express themselves freely			0
and we must always defend the right of a free press to do its work without fear or favour , ' he will add			0
' it is at times like these , when our freedoms are under threat , that we must stand up for them most of all			0
