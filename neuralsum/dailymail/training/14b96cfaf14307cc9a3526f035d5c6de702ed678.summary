by @entity0 they say a man forms a special bond with his first car - and one man pensioner proved the strength of that devotion by tracking down his classic motor for a second time , 61 years after he first bought it			1
after saving for months , 17 - year - old @entity11 bought the car of his dreams in 1953 - a 1936 @entity14			1
the young engineer bought the second - hand car for £ 140 , and spent hours polishing the bright red convertible , which even helped him woo his wife - to - be			1
in 1955 mr @entity11 reluctantly traded the car in for a larger alternative , but never forgot about his first ride			1
decades after the fateful sale his passion for classic cars led him to strike up a search to see whether he could track down the old car and buy it back			1
miraculously , the search was successful and , aged 77 , mr @entity11 was able to buy the @entity29 7 back for £ 4,000			1
in the 56 years since he had seen it the car had decayed considerably , but after three years of loving attention , it has been restored to its formerly glory			1
it has even passed its @entity45			0
restored : the much - loved model is back to its former glory after three years of work adored : the much - loved model even helped mr @entity11 woo his wife @entity50 mr @entity11 , who has now retired and lives in @entity51 , @entity52 , said : ' i bought the car from a greengrocer in @entity56 for £ 140 in 1953			1
' i must have saved for months to find the money and i was worried someone else would snatch it up but when i drove it home for the first time i felt like a king			2
' i sold it in 1955 after trading it in for a bigger car but i always regretted doing that			2
i loved the car and over the years i just wanted to get it back			2
' i got into classic cars and bought a @entity70 and a @entity72 convertible but i always hankered for the old 1936 @entity73			2
' finally i saw it advertised when i went to the @entity75 at the @entity76 in 2011			0
i enquired about the car immediately but was devastated to learn it had been sold the day before			2
poor condition : both the interior and the exterior of the car were in a bad way when mr @entity11 bought it back in 2011 rusted : it took a lot of work to restore the car , a process which has cost some £ 10,000 gutted : the car , which had turned a shade of orange , was completely stripped down and repainted ' it had been off the road for 40 years in a barn in @entity96 in @entity97			1
it was rotten and covered in toy teddy bears			0
i did n't recognise it			0
but when i saw the number plate my heart jumped			0
' i was determined not to let it slip away			0
the purchaser had agreed the deal and , even though it was painted orange and in a very grim state , i knew i could get it back to how it used to be			0
' i collected the car the following week and started on the restoration immediately			2
i was 75 when i got the car back so i felt time was of the essence			0
' then on november 4 , 2012 , just eleven months after the project began it passed its @entity45 first time			0
i love driving it around now			0
i feel exactly like i did when i was 17			0
' @entity50 , 77 , a retired adminstrator , added : ' i always say to people that @entity11 loved two things in this life , me and that @entity73			1
' i remember him driving me around when we first started courting and it is lovely to go out again and re-live all those wonderful memories			0
' the @entity29 7 - or ' @entity29 ' - was one of the first breakout success stories of @entity128 motoring			1
developed in the face of flagging fortunes from its manufacturers , the diminutive model lowered the cost of motoring and was a first car to thousands who had never driven before			0
the car - which is so tiny it can fit on a billiards table - eventually sold 375,000 models , and the designed was licensed in countries including @entity140 and the @entity141 , giving it even further reach			1
a version of the classic car was also used in the @entity147 children 's programme @entity148 , which saw an enchanted miniature @entity73 come to life when its owner was away , classic : @entity153 , in the @entity147 children 's tv series @entity156 7 factfile transmission : three - speed manual ; four - speed from 1933 @entity160 : 13 - 23bhp top speed : 45mph +			2

@entity11 was just 17 when he bought the @entity29 7 in 1953
he saved for months to buy the it for £ 140 - but *replaced* it two years later
but he always missed the car - and decades later managed to track it down
it was badly decayed , but after years of work mr @entity11 , now 77 , can drive his beloved first car once more
