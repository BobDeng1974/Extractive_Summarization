by @entity0 me after you : a @entity3 , loss and other disasters by @entity6 they always say you should begin a book with a killer first line , and @entity6 certainly does that			1
‘ i knew he was dead , ’ she writes			2
the @entity13 whom she reverently capitalises throughout her book ( to disconcerting effect , as though she were writing about the @entity16 ) is — was — her 37 - year - old husband , @entity17 , who collapsed and died two years ago while they were making love in @entity6 ’s mother ’s bed			1
‘ she was out at the time , i hasten to add , ’ lucie explains , with the mordant humour that makes her memoir of early widowhood such a wrenchingly funny read			1
@entity17 ’s last words were : ‘ you ’ve still got your socks on			2
’ devoted : lucie and @entity17 on their wedding day in 2006			1
two years later she became an early widow			2
‘ hardly the @entity38 of last words , ’ remarks his widow			2
the circumstances of @entity17 ’s sudden collapse read like a @entity43 tragi - comedy , but , until then , his married life with @entity6 had been idyllic			1
they fell in love at first sight in 2002 , married in 2006 and , two years later , their daughter , ‘ b ’ , was born			1
they lived in @entity51 , in a house specially chosen for its diminutive size — ‘ like mr and mrs @entity55 , we liked to be able to reach out and touch each other ’ — and @entity17 commuted to his job as a security analyst at @entity59 in @entity60			2
it was on a late summer ’s day in 2008 that the first shadow fell over their perfect family			2
unable to contact @entity17 by phone , @entity6 rang @entity59 to find that he had n’t turned up for work			1
ten minutes later the hospital called			2
@entity17 had managed to summon an ambulance before collapsing with an aortic dissection — a tear in the wall of the artery carrying blood from the heart			0
‘ is it life - threatening ? ’ @entity6 asked			1
‘ i ca n’t answer “ no ” to that , ’ the consultant replied			0
three months later , and three stone lighter having suffered a stroke during open - heart surgery , @entity17 came home			0
‘ he ’d been given a second chance and he was going to take it with both hands , ’ lucie writes			1
four years on , that ’s exactly what he was doing			0
they were visiting @entity6 ’s mum for her grandma ’s funeral			1
the previous autumn , @entity6 had suffered a miscarriage			1
now , they were trying for another baby			0
‘ those who become embroiled in the complicated world of conception know that there is a “ moment ” during the month at which all systems must absolutely go			0
this was n’t going to be the @entity97 of sessions			0
and besides , @entity101 was starting in ten minutes , so we had to be quick			0
’ @entity6 ’s memoir , which started life as a very personal blog , is a raw howl of disbelief at the speed with which a baby - making quickie could turn to life - shattering tragedy			1
on the whole , society prefers widows to be dignified , composed and , as soon as decently possible after the funeral , invisible			0
@entity6 was none of those			1
she held it together for long enough to give a magnificent , tearless eulogy at @entity17 ’s funeral , after which she wept uncontrollably , replacing the lost fluid with gallons of red wine , occasionally varied with champagne or tequila			0
she raged at her mum			0
she blighted family gatherings with her inconsolable grief			0
she was unable even to function fully as a newly single parent			2
@entity6 was often at her wit 's end but hers is a story of survival ( posed by model ) during evenings of ‘ wine and late - night tv , interspersed with pangs of longing for my husband and my previous life			1
i would wake up , sometimes on the settee , but often in bed alongside my child , not remembering how either of us had got there			0
’ most startlingly of all , a year after @entity17 ’s death from catastrophic heart arrhythmia , @entity6 embarked on a vigorous sexual relationship with a luridly tattooed local plumber — ‘ with him , i felt i was immune to the curse of death by intercourse			1
’ me after you is , despite everything , a story of survival and , cautiously , recovery			0
it is very funny about the grim trappings of sudden death , from sinisterly chirpy funeral directors to the horror of cancelling @entity17 ’s insurance policies : ‘ so your husband died , @entity6 , yeah ! brilliant ! ok , i ’m gon na need to take some details			1
’ it certainly does n’t draw a veil over the bad bits			0
one of the worst moments came when @entity6 posted a link to her blog on a website for young widows where she had found comfort , only to be informed by the site ’s founder that her diary was ‘ moronic ’ and that she was henceforth banned			1
the fact that her blog later won an award and is now published as a book must feel like a triumphant vindication			0
but the real triumph is that she survived , sustained by her own gritty strength , and with lots of help from her family , her little daughter , her endlessly understanding friends , and her new dog , @entity197 , all of whom sound lovely			2
two - and - a - half years on , with ‘ a new house in a new place , with new friends and a new dog , and the potential of a new relationship ’ , @entity6 still has n’t been able to bring herself to decide what to do with @entity17 ’s ashes			1
‘ he is still in his ornate , lacquered box at the bottom of my wardrobe			0
’ but she writes : ‘ i believe that @entity17 would want us to be happy			0

@entity6 's husband collapsed and died while they were making love
as a single mother @entity6 was left to look after daughter alone
lucie gives a raw , no holds barred account of widowhood
