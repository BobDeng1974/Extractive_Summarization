@entity1 boss @entity0 will put any anniversary celebrations on hold as he seeks to secure what would rank as one of the most famous wins of his turbulent reign at @entity8			1
next week will mark four years since @entity0 succeeded @entity9 as @entity11 boss despite many - perhaps sometimes even @entity0 himself - predicting he would never survive to see such a milestone			1
but a run of just one @entity16 defeat in nine has lifted much of the immediate pressure off @entity0 's shoulders and convinced him his side can rise to the occasion and become the first this season to sink @entity23 's @entity22			2
@entity1 boss @entity0 will celebrate four years in charge at the club next week @entity26 ( right ) celebrates scoring @entity1 's equaliser against @entity28 at @entity29 on tuesday @entity1 train at their training centre on thursday ahead of their clash with @entity22 on saturday @entity0 said : ' i have n't really thought about it ( the anniversary ) at this stage because this game takes precedence over anything like that and i will probably review it some other time			1
' as a coach it 's the same as the players - you 've got to rise to the occasion and i ca n't wait for the game and i hope the players are feeling the same way			0
' getting on the same pitch as the likes of ( @entity53 ) hazard and ( @entity55 ) @entity54 and ( @entity56 ) @entity56 is fantastic and you 've got to raise your game			1
if you are not going to get inspired by that then do n't play			0
' @entity1 's dramatic recent revival has stalled slightly with defeat at @entity63 and a frustrating midweek draw at @entity28 but @entity0 is boosted by the return of @entity66 - who scored the winner against @entity22 two seasons ago - and @entity69 for the saturday lunchtime clash			1
@entity0 believes his player will be ' inspired ' by playing against @entity56 ( left ) and @entity52 ( centre ) @entity73 , @entity1 's young goalkeeper , waits to save a shot during training on thursday but he has injury worries elsewhere with goalkeeper @entity77 ruled out until the new year with an ankle injury and captain @entity79 unlikely to be risked as he struggles for match fitness following his return from a hamstring strain			1
@entity0 's survival against the odds this season is exemplified in the way his players have battled back from a dismal start to the campaign and fostered the kind of team spirit that he believes will ensure they continue to improve			2
and it means he has no fears about taking the game to a @entity22 side he believes is probably the best he has seen since he grew up watching the club in his youth			2
@entity0 added : ' i think mentally we 're in a strong position and our confidence is high - we 've had one defeat in nine and we have a good kind of spirit and we 're still learning lessons along the way			0
@entity1 defender @entity79 ( centre ) could return against @entity22 after a calf problem ' we learned at @entity28 that you have got to put the ball at risk and take chances in the game and that even against the so - called lesser opposition you still have to take risks			2
' especially against @entity117 teams , if you 're not going to take risks you 're not going to make forward runs and you 're not going to threaten the opposition and you 'll get beaten , so we need to threaten against @entity22			0
' while @entity66 's return is especially timely , @entity0 is also counting on the continued improvement of striker @entity26 , who struck his fifth goal of the season to rescue a point at @entity29 on tuesday			0
@entity0 added : ' @entity26 is a goalscorer and scoring goals breeds confidence , of course			0
he is a player who has five goals in the @entity16 and he 's probably only had eight chances			0
' that 's @entity26 - he has a good consistent strike rate when he gets the chances			0
' @entity79 ( left ) and @entity134 train for @entity1 on thursday ahead of @entity22 clash			1

@entity1 host @entity22 at @entity8 on saturday
@entity0 will celebrate four years in charge of @entity11 next week
he *insists* he will not ' review ' his time at club until after @entity22 clash
@entity0 believes @entity1 players being on the same pitch as the likes of @entity52 , @entity54 and @entity56 will ' inspire ' them
