@entity0 has re-established contact with a satellite containing geckos designed to test the effects of weightlessness on reproduction			1
the lives of the geckos , along with other animals on board including fruit flies , were feared at risk when engineers were unable to communicate with @entity14 following its launch on 19 july but the spacecraft is now back in the hands of ground control and the mission can safely continue towards a planned landing on @entity22 in september			1
the five lizards are flying in the @entity28 experiment aboard the satellite ( ground control experiment shown )			0
they are being observed to see how their bodies and sexual behaviour are affected by microgravity five lizards are flying on the @entity28 experiment aboard the satellite			0
contained in a small room , they are being observed to see how their bodies and sexual behaviour are affected by microgravity			0
the species being used is the @entity45 ornate day gecko ( @entity47 ornate ) , according to @entity48 , which can reach up to 4.7 inches ( 12 centimetres ) in length			0
inside their habitat is a ventilation system to supply fresh air , food for two months , environmental control in the form of temperature and light and a waste disposal system			0
a video camera is being used to monitor their behaviour and any eggs that are produced			0
these are expected to hatch after 40 days , which means they will hatch while the mission is still in space - an important goal that would assess the effects of microgravity on birth			1
the geckos and their offspring will be assessed on their return to @entity22 in september			1
‘ we have conducted several communication sessions , and the link is stable , ’ head of @entity81 @entity80 said , reports @entity76			1
‘ we are sure that we will be able to conduct 90 per cent of what we initially planned			1
’ communication was made on the spacecraft on saturday night			0
the @entity85 of satellites are a continuation of the @entity0 @entity89 spacecraft , which are intended to observe the effects of space travel on different species			1
aside from geckos this particular satellite also has other biological experiments on board including fruit flies and mushrooms from both @entity0 and @entity99			2
the two - month mission will monitor by video how well the geckos sexually reproduce in space before returning them safely to @entity22			1
the reason communication was lost with the 6.8 - ton satellite is n't known , but @entity81 thinks it may have been due to impact with space debris or a mechanical failure			1
the satellite will be studied on its return to @entity22 in september to see what the cause was			2
if it does turn out to be space debris , this will be cause for concern ; it is estimated there are 22,000 man - made objects four inches ( 10 cm ) or larger in @entity22 orbit			1
and there are some fears @entity22 orbit may become polluted to such an extent that many spacecraft are at risk			2
the biological experiment launched from the @entity125 in @entity126 last week			2
ground controllers had been unable to communicate with the @entity130 - @entity129 satellite ( illustration shown )			1
the @entity130 series of satellites are designed to perform biological experiments in space following the launch , the satellite had been failing to respond to commands to start its engine and move to a higher orbit , according to the progress space firm			1
however , the rest of its systems were operating nominally , which means the animals on board remained alive			0
‘ the equipment which is working in automatic mode , and in particular the experiment with the geckos is working according to the programme , ’ said @entity147 after lanch , a spokesman of @entity0 's @entity150 , which is running the experiment			0
@entity157 said the design of the @entity129 ‘ allows for the functioning of the satellite in automatic mode for a long time			2
’ regaining control over the satellite 's engine was needed to ensure its controlled return to @entity22 as planned in two months to recover the geckos for further study			1
at the moment the spacecraft is still orbital height of about 155 miles ( 250 kilometres )			0
the original mission specification , however , called for the spacecraft to be raised to an altitude of 357 miles ( 575 km )			0
the planned burn to get the spacecraft to this height did not occur after the launch due to a malfunction , leaving it stuck in a lower orbit			2
however , @entity0 space officials will decide today whether to attempt moving the satellite into a higher orbit , or they may consider leaving it where it is if the goals of the mission can still be attained			2
the capsule will re-enter @entity22 's atmosphere in mid-september and land via parachute in southern @entity0			0
pictured is the launch of the satellite on a @entity192 rocket from @entity125 in the early hours of 19 july			1
aside from geckos this particular satellite also has other biological experiments on board including fruit flies and mushrooms			0
it is a continuation of @entity0 's @entity89 series of satellites			0

a spacecraft launched from @entity126 carrying animals has been saved
ground controllers have re-established contact with the @entity130 - @entity129 satellite
on board it has five geckos intended to reproduce and test the effects of microgravity on reproduction , among other animals
mission was feared lost when the satellite went silent after 19 july launch
but now contact has been made and ' 90 per cent ' of goals can be achieved says head of @entity81 @entity80
and a planned landing for the spacecraft in two months will bring the animals on board safely back to @entity22
