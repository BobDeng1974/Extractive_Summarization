@entity0 is rejecting demands from an @entity3 body that it should stop surgically castrating sex criminals - a practice that dates back to the @entity6 - because it is ‘ degrading ’			1
defying @entity9 , the @entity8 government said it intends to carry on with the practice citing low re-offending rates among sex criminals who had opted to have the procedure			1
it pointed out the results of a 1997 study that tracked the history of 104 sexual offenders ' who subjected themselves to castration in the decade between 1970 and 1980			1
their reoffending rate was three per cent , ' the @entity8 authorities explained , ' as opposed to 46 per cent for a control group			1
' the @entity8 government said it intends to carry on with the practice citing low re-offending rates among sex criminals who had opted to have the procedure the scheme is voluntary			1
against the backdrop of such results , @entity0 is not thought likely to buckle under @entity3 pressure anytime soon - particularly as the country ’s worst child serial killer and rapist , due to be sentenced next week , has evoked strong public support for the policy			2
on average there have been five such castrations every year over the past decade			1
a government spokesman said : ' @entity0 defends the procedure on the grounds that surgery helps where illnesses connected to an abnormal sex drive must be treated , or in order to counter the risk of future unlawful offences being committed by sexual offenders and / or violent offender			1
‘ as far as the federal government is aware , there are quite a number of scientific studies on the criminological long - term effects of surgical castration			1
’ there are no plans to remove it from the constitution although @entity62 said it would be agreeable to talks on the issue			2
@entity0 was criticised in a report issued by @entity67 ’s anti-torture body , the @entity68 ( @entity69 )			2
in its own words it regards itself as ' influential in setting the @entity3 political agenda , but it has no powers to pass laws ’			2
in its report on castration it said ; ' the @entity69 must express its fundamental objections to the use of surgical castration as a means of treatment of sexual offenders			0
surgical castration is a mutilating , irreversible intervention and can not be considered as a medical necessity in the context of the treatment of sexual offenders			0
' in the @entity69 ’s view , surgical castration of detained sexual offenders could easily be considered as amounting to degrading treatment			0
' the @entity3 recommends the “ liquid cosh ” approach - chemicals which effectively destroy a sex offender ’s libido thus , goes the argument , rendering him harmless			0
@entity0 said the procedure helps treat illnesses connected to an abnormal sex drive and counters risk of future unlawful offences being committed by sexual offenders and / or violent offender in @entity0 , sex criminals aged over 25 have the option of surgical castration if the operation is cleared by an expert and it stresses it is not a punishment , but an option			0
the programme has its roots in the days of the @entity113 when the @entity6 sterilised thousands of sexual criminals - most of them forcibly			0
many experiments were carried out in concentration camps to find ever quicker and cheaper ways of performing the procedures			0
in 1969 it was modified under the @entity8 legal code whereby the offender must give his consent , be informed about the implications and side - effects of castration and be informed about other treatments			1
nevertheless , @entity62 agreed to ' examine if the issue should be discussed			0
' besides @entity0 , the @entity129 is the only other of the 47 @entity67 member states which gives sex offenders the option of physical castration			0
next week in @entity0 sees the sentencing of a youth worker called @entity137 who has confessed to the rape and murders of three small boys and the sexual assaults of 20 others .			0
