these images of drowned cattle are enough to make meat eaters and vegetarians alike shed a tear over the mistake that caused their mass death			0
last week , about 100 cattle wandered onto a @entity10 reservoir covered in six - inch - thick ice while seeking shelter in a severe windstorm			1
their hunt for rest turned tragic when the ice collapsed under their enormous weight of more than 1,000 pounds			1
fell through : @entity20 ( left ) and @entity21 ( right ) use a shovel and a prying tool to free a dead cow from the ice on @entity26 south of @entity27 , @entity10 on tuesday			0
last week an estimated 100 of @entity28 and his brother @entity32 cows wandered onto the ice , broke through and died loss : @entity20 looks over the scene at @entity26			1
he estimates that he lost $ 300,000 worth of cattle and is uncertain how his business is going to recover most of the cows that fell through drowned , leaving their owners out hundreds of thousands of dollars and also heartbroken at the gruesome accident			1
@entity41 and @entity42 own the herd on the @entity44 , and discovered the horrific scene on january 8th during the morning feeding time			2
@entity46 had a hard time finding the cattle at first , but then eventually found a group feeding near the reservoir where there were several floating masses of dark brown			0
he was sickened when he realized the masses were his cows , drowned			0
breaking through : @entity57 solid waste director @entity21 uses a prying tool to break ice on @entity26 on tuesday			0
it 's rare for cows to stray onto frozen over bodies of water ' i 've been ranching over 40 years , ' @entity41 told the @entity65 , ' and i do n't ever remember cattle walking out on ice or falling through			1
' the @entity68 say that most of the cows that wandered out onto the ice were prized 2 - year - old bred heifers			1
the older ones apparently knew better than to walk out onto the ice			0
they say the ice was about as thick as a slice of bread , collapsing easily when forced down with 1,100 pounds of cattle			2
the @entity68 , who are members of the @entity57 , estimate that the incident cost them $ 300,000 and they do n't know how that 's going to impact their business yet			1
' i do n't know what the hell is going to happen , ' @entity41 said , adding that the ranching business ' was starting to really pay off			0
hopefully we can stay in business			0
this week the @entity68 have been working to extract their dead cows from the body of water , which has been a complicated job .			2
