a tight - knit @entity1 tribe is grappling for answers after friday 's high school shooting when one of their own shot four of his friends at point - blank range then killed himself			1
@entity10 's rampage , the latest in an increasingly frequent number of mass gun attacks , sent shock waves through the @entity14 , one of the most economically and politically successful @entity17 communities in the @entity18			1
just weeks before , he had been joyfully riding bikes with his two brother - like cousins @entity22 and @entity23 - who were both left in a critical condition after the attack			1
baffled : members of the community grieve beside a makeshift memorial at @entity30 desensitized ? people suggested gun crime is now a desensitized subject as shootings are more frequent questions : the @entity14 tribe is grappling to ascertain what drove @entity10 to shoot his friends in the head ' for our generation , we could n't have even fathomed something like this , ' said @entity45 resident @entity44 , standing near a makeshift memorial of flowers and notes near the school			1
' for some of these kids , they 've now heard about it so many times ... they almost in a way are desensitized to it			0
' as three teenagers continue to fight for their lives , it appears the attack will have a minimal effect on the nation 's stance on gun laws			0
it comes after a @entity66 and @entity67 report revealed this month that mass shootings are becoming more frequent , with an average of 16.4 active - shooter incidents from 2007 through 2013 , more than double the 6.4 average from 2000 to 2006			1
citizens are expected to turn out in droves to a vote next week on @entity76 's proposed adjustments to gun laws - whether or not to widen or limit background checks - in reaction to the shooting			0
however , with a minuscule fatality count in comparison to previous shootings , analysts predict the knock - on effects will not cross state borders			0
@entity10 , the shooter , carried a .40 caliber handgun , reportedly owned by his father , which he used to kill himself , police said			2
relatives have identified the two male victims as cousins he treated like brothers : @entity22 , 14 , and @entity23 , 15			1
no one saw it coming : @entity10 , 15 , was an outgoing , popular schoolboy who was proud of his heritage victims : his close friends @entity101 ( left ) and @entity102 ( right ) are fighting for life in hospital more frequent : @entity66 has found the frequency of mass shootings in the @entity18 has doubled since 2011			1
the chart above is from research by the @entity109 , published in @entity110 @entity22 , in serious condition with a gunshot to the jaw , improved on sunday , while @entity23 was in critical condition with a gunshot wound to the head , hospital officials said			2
female victims @entity102 and @entity101 , both 14 , remained in critical condition at a different hospital , officials said			1
@entity122 , 14 , was killed in the attack			1
the boys were all members of the @entity14 , which has boosted @entity126 's economy with businesses and retail parks and even won the governance of @entity131 award from @entity66			2
tribal leaders recalled that @entity10 and @entity22 seemed like best friends , growing up doors away from each other near @entity45 on the reservation that 2,700 @entity137 call home			1
they rode four - wheelers along back roads near the @entity142 just months ago , played video games after school , went to the movies and played basketball and football together , family members said			0
struck : the @entity14 tribe , one of the nation 's most successful @entity17 communities , is reeling in shock devastating : tribe members said they have no idea what led @entity10 to unleash his deadly attack and kill himself the boys were also often together with the victims , attending the ceremonial @entity160 festival in june and , on the saturday before the shooting , @entity10 and all the victims went to a high school dance together			1
@entity10 's deadly outburst just days later left the thriving community baffled			2
' it 's just so devastating , ' @entity166 , a @entity14 board member and national expert on violence against @entity17 women , told the @entity171			2
' we just do n't know how it all adds up			0
' a native youth counselor @entity174 told the paper tribal leaders will consider whether his dual culture had anything to do with the outburst			0
' none of us can really say what led him to that , ' @entity174 said			0
' but you could say that when you 're part of another culture , that 's just an added stress on top of what is already a very stressful time in every kid 's life			0
' but he added : ' they 're very family - oriented			0
all of them come from big families that love and support each other			0
that 's what makes a lot of it unreal , i guess			0
