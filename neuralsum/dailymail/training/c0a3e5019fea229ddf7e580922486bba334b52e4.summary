by @entity1 reporter published : 00:57 est , 6 december 2013 @entity3 : 08:55 est , 6 december 2013 researchers in @entity5 have found a revolutionary way to let amputees feel what they 're touching with prosthetic hands			1
the team from @entity11 and @entity12 has created a means of letting users feel more sensations , better , and with more sustained results than ever before			1
while others have hade lukewarm success at connecting nerves with electrodes , this team 's special technique has created remarkable results			1
placed in a user 's body and connected to nerve bundles through the arm stump , the electrodes convey sensations from sensors on a prosthetic hand or fingers			1
the sense of touch is felt from 20 different spots on the hand , another feat on the part of its developers			2
what 's more , the results have been found to last past 18 months whereas other such trials have ended with degraded sensation in the nerves			1
' it ’s real exciting to see what they are doing , and i hope it can help other people , ' @entity26 says			2
“ i know that science takes a long time			2
if i do n’t get something to take home , but the next person does , it ’s all to the better			2
” neuroscience professor at @entity76 told @entity77 just how exciting these results really are			0
revolutionary : with the sensation on , @entity26 is able to actually feel the cherry and control his grip accordingly new technique : the remarkable results are thanks to a new technique of connecting electrodes to bundles of nerves in the arm ' this is the greatest number of distinct touch sensations generated by peripheral nerve stimulation that i know of , and the 18 - month - long stability is also unsurpassed , ' @entity91 said			1
two people have thus far been fitted with the device , including @entity99 , @entity5 man @entity26			0
@entity35 is the subject of videos made by the researchers that first show him attempting to take the stem from a cherry while the sensation is turned off in his hand			1
as would often be the case for many prostetic hand users , he 's unsable to complete the take without crushing the cherry			0
with the hand turned on , it 's a different story			0
@entity35 is able to remove the stem , leaving the cherry intact			0
