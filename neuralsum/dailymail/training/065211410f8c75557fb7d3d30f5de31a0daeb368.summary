by @entity0 published : 03:45 est , 8 may 2013 updated : 06:27 est , 8 may 2013 adrift in the vast @entity2 for four weeks , two fishermen began to drink sea water when the rains stopped and their small supply of fresh water ran out			1
the salt water would have killed them from severe dehydration within three days - but just as all hope was running out the desperate men were seen by a @entity12 fishing boat			1
as 40 - year - old @entity15 and @entity16 , 20 , recovered from their ordeal on board the @entity19 today , the ship 's captain , @entity13 , told how he found the men by chance			2
survivors : @entity23 , 40 , left , and 20 year old @entity16 , right , survived four weeks adrift by drinking rain water and eating raw fish ' they had drifted 420 miles from @entity27 , in @entity29 's @entity28 , where they 'd been fishing , ' said captain @entity13			1
' they were surviving on raw fish and rain water , but when the rains stopped and there was no fresh water they were in a lot of trouble			1
' they were extremely weak and malnourished , but , surprisingly , they are in a lot better shape than i would have been , put it that way - it 's a hell of an ordeal , believe me			0
' captain @entity13 told @entity49 that he was lucky to find the men			0
' we were searching for fish and 16 miles away on my bird radar i spotted a small flock of birds			0
' as fish attract birds , i went to go and check it out and luckily i did turn that way to check because we found this small boat with two men adrift at sea , lost			2
we found them in the nick of time			0
' the pair were fishing off the coast of the @entity28 in @entity29 when their engine broke down and they drifted 420 miles west towards the @entity71 before they could be saved and taken to @entity73 captain @entity13 said the men were on a 14ft boat when the engine broke down and strong winds began pushing them towards the @entity71			1
' once they were taken on board i gave them water straight away , just small amounts at a time			0
' it was a dry spell and they were n't getting much rain and what happened was they started drinking salt water - and that 's lethal			0
' they would n't have last another three days doing that			0
' after rehydrating themselves the men spent an hour in a small chapel on the @entity19 giving thanks for their rescue			1
the men 's board was hauled onto the @entity19 , which is based at @entity73 , and captain @entity98 promised them that he and his crew would repair the engine and return it to their island home when his vessel passes by that way			2
the plan was to take the men to the @entity71 where arrangements would be made to return them to @entity29			1
' they 've spoken to their families and it 's turned out to be a very happy ending , ' said captain @entity13 .			0

two men spent a month at sea after drifting 420 miles away from their home
the @entity29 fishermen , aged 20 and 40 , lived off raw fish and rainwater
