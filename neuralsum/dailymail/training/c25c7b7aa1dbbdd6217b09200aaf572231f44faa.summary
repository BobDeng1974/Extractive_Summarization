@entity0 has refused to dwell on @entity3 's disgraceful @entity2 exit to @entity4 as he eyes a @entity7 final at the expense of @entity9			1
@entity0 , who on monday celebrated his 52nd birthday , labelled last saturday 's loss to @entity12 a ' disgrace ' and ' unacceptable ' after the @entity14 led 2 - 0 only to fall to a 4 - 2 defeat			1
@entity3 face @entity9 at @entity16 on tuesday night with their @entity18 semi-final poised at 1 - 1 after the first leg and @entity0 has quickly recalibrated			1
@entity0 ( centre ) wants his side to move on from the disappointment of going out of the @entity2 @entity3 manager ( right ) tried to shake hands with @entity12 manager @entity25 ( centre ) before the end ' the next game is the most important one , ' @entity0 said on chelseafc.com			1
' we need to forget this one ( @entity12 ) and start the next game in a different competition , and i know we are one victory away from playing a final			2
' it 's the good thing about playing consecutive matches without many days in between			0
@entity38 looks on after being beaten by a thunderous @entity40 strike just before half - time ' it 's the good thing that , when you lose , you have to focus immediately on the next game			2
' you do n't have a lot of time to be moaning or analysing what happened in the bad one			0
let 's move and let 's think about the next one			0
' at the end of may , beginning of june , we do n't go to @entity7 to play the @entity2 final , that 's for sure			1
' the @entity2 is finished for us			2
we do n't go there even to play the @entity2 semi-final			2
it 's over for us			0
' to go there - and i think that should mean a lot to everyone - the last chance we have is this one , to play there in the @entity18 final			0
' @entity12 's @entity64 celebrates after equalising against @entity3 - who released him as a youngster @entity0 is likely to revert to his first - choice players in a key week for @entity3 as holders @entity70 visit the leaders in the @entity72 on saturday			1
having seen their challenge for an unprecedented quadruple ended by @entity4 , @entity3 know they must perform at their best to keep alive their remaining hopes of silverware			1
@entity79 , one of the players who failed to see off @entity4 , believes the game - by - game approach of his manager is the right one			1
@entity79 was unable to find the scoresheet on saturday but hopes that @entity3 can bounce back ' of course everything is capable this season , but at the same time , you can lose everything , like on saturday , ' said @entity79 , who on sunday collected the 2015 @entity91 at a gala dinner in @entity93			0
' we need to stay focused on what we want to achieve , but also at the same time we have to take it game by game from now until the end of the season , because this is the part of the season where everything is decided more and matters			0
' after a defeat , you always want to bounce back and that is what we hope to do			0
' saturday 's match is likely to feature @entity109 , @entity3 's record goalscorer , returning to @entity16 in the light blue of @entity70			1
@entity109 set to return to @entity16 for the first time since leaving the club in the summer @entity109 spent 13 years at @entity3 , many of them alongside @entity79 , with the pair instrumental in many successes , not least three @entity72 titles and a @entity118 success			2
@entity109 's @entity3 contract was not renewed last summer and he signed for @entity121 's @entity120 , only to then join @entity70 on a short - term deal which has been extended until the end of the season due to his fine form			1
the 36 - year - old former @entity126 international , who scored the equaliser in a 1 - 1 draw at the @entity131 earlier this season , will be aiming to help second - placed @entity70 narrow the five - point gap with a win at his old hunting ground			1
@entity109 scored a spectacular 147 goals for @entity3 during his 13 years at the club ' i hope he is going to get the best reception like i had last year when i came to @entity141 with @entity142 because that is the least he deserves , ' @entity79 added			0
' i am not surprised by what he has done at @entity70 this season			0
' i think he is a professional and that is how he was when he played for @entity3 and why i have so much respect for him and what he is doing there			0
' for a fantastic player like him , he can play anywhere so that is why i am not surprised by his current form			0

@entity0 's side were *knocked* out of the @entity2 by @entity4
@entity3 were 2 - 0 up but ended up losing 4 - 2 to the @entity12 side
the @entity14 drew 1 - 1 with @entity9 in the first leg at @entity160
