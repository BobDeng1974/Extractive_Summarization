the number of vulnerable older people getting help to live in their own homes has dropped by a third over the past five years , according to a charity ’s analysis yesterday			2
the number of people getting help with getting up , getting dressed , washing , and with meals or shopping has fallen to just 371,000 , down by more than 170,000 since 2010 , @entity6 said			1
it blamed a squeeze on state - funded social care at a time when numbers of older people who need help are rising			1
the number of vulnerable older people getting help to live in their own homes has dropped by a third over the past five years , according to a charity ’s analysis yesterday ( stock image ) the charity said there are now 900,000 over- 65s who need care of some kind at their home but who do not get it			2
the report follows years of increasing concern over the way local councils have been withdrawing home help from all elderly people except those with the most limiting disabilities and illnesses , leaving hundreds of thousands without help			2
middle class elderly people have been particularly badly affected , because those with savings or property worth over a means test threshold , usually £ 23,250 , are left not only without state help but without advice on how to buy their own			0
people who do get care at home are often subject to 15 - minute rules which often give visiting care workers too little time to do their job , or talk to the person they are helping			2
a series of inquiries into the way state help is delivered to vulnerable older people have found that billions more taxpayers ’ money should be spent			0
in 2006 sir @entity62 said spending should be trebled to £ 30 billion a year , and a review for the @entity65 by economist @entity66 last year found similar sums were necessary			0
age @entity69 ’s charity director @entity68 said : ‘ this devastating scorecard speaks for itself and it lays bare the fact that our state - funded social care system is in calamitous , quite rapid decline			1
there are now 900,000 over- 65s who need care of some kind at their home but who do not get it ( stock image ) ' the more preventive services like meals on wheels and day care are being especially hard hit , leaving the system increasingly the preserve of older people in the most acute need , storing up big problems for the future			1
’ the charity said that just under a third of the older people who have difficulties carrying out everyday activities get no help from outside carers			0
among them , it counted half of those who struggle to wash or get in the bath – 500,000 people ; a third of those who find it hard to get out of bed – 190,000 people ; and two in five of those who have difficulty getting dressed – 590,000 people			0
it also said there was no outside help for two thirds of those who find it hard to eat – 160,000 people ; four fifths of those who need help taking medication – 200,000 people ; and one in three of those who have difficulty using the toilet – 120,000 people			0
the charity said the number of people receiving personal home care has dropped to 370,630 from 542,965 between the 2010/11 financial year , which marked the coming to power of @entity129 ’s @entity128 , and the 2013/14 year , a fall of 31.7 per cent			1
those receiving meals on wheels dropped even more sharply , by 63 per cent , from 81,460 to 29,560			1
according to the report , in 2005 more than 15 per cent of people over 65 received social care of some kind , but that dropped to 12 per cent by 2010			1
it is currently nine per cent			0
miss @entity68 said : ‘ hundreds of thousands of older people who need social care are being left high and dry			1
the lucky ones have sufficient funds to buy in some support , or can rely on the goodwill of family , neighbours and friends			0
but there are many who are being left to struggle on entirely alone			0
‘ many hospitals are finding it hard to discharge older people and commentators are asking why this challenge seems to be growing , year on year			0
a big part of the explanation is revealed by this scorecard : the marked decline in central government funding for social care and the resultant reduction in support for older people to live independently at home – this at the same time as their numbers are rising			1
‘ policymakers owe it to the public , older people especially , to confront the crisis in social care and its consequences			1
' the @entity174 blamed councils for failing to provide enough support for the vulnerable elderly			0
a spokesman said : ‘ we have given an extra £ 1.1 billion to councils to help protect social care services this year on top of additional funding in recent years but ultimately they are responsible for deciding how to spend their budgets			2
‘ we know we need to work differently to respond to our growing ageing population - our @entity187 and £ 5.3 billion @entity188 , the biggest ever national programme to join up health and social care , will focus resources on helping people to live independently , which will save money and reduce unnecessary hospital admissions			1
’ officials suggested there was ‘ significant scope ’ for councils to make savings by reducing £ 2 billion a year of uncollected council tax , £ 2 billion lost from @entity202 and other fraud , and £ 19 billion held in reserves .			0

the number of people getting help has dropped by 170,000 since 2010
