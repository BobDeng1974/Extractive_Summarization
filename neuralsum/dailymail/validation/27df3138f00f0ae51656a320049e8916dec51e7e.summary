at least half the audience may have been paying very close attention to the hunky leading man			0
but some viewers of @entity4 will have appreciated the delightfully rustic charms of the backdrop to this story of love , jealousy and passion			2
in the @entity14 drama , the bustling town of @entity12 is a lost world of 18th - century wooden shop fronts , muddy thoroughfares and pens of geese and sheep			1
which goes to prove how cleverly the producers disguised the fact that it is actually a real - life @entity25 market town a long horse ride from the series ’ rugged @entity30 setting			1
pens for animals , as well as a vegetable stall and a @entity40 , were added to create a typical scene from the period @entity44 's dirt road that 's really got yellow lines : the street where @entity47 and his future wife @entity44 walked is a real row of terrace houses in @entity51			1
the producers hid the modern double yellow lines under a fake dirt - covered road that looked as though it was from another era saddlery that 's really a curry house : with its panelled frontage and rows of saddles , @entity58 and @entity59 is entirely convincing as an 18th - century saddlery			1
but the elaborate facade was required to hide a much more modern stalwart of the @entity67 - the @entity68 restaurant			2
@entity70 's @entity69 had its signature green shop front hidden behind a carefully crafted set , complete with barrel and harness stands when captain @entity47 rescued his future wife , @entity44 , from a gang of thugs in the first episode of the eight - part series , he was not in @entity30 at all , but more than 150 miles away in @entity51 , @entity80			1
though its stone buildings look believable on screen , these photographs reveal how the town usually looks — complete with @entity68 restaurant and baby clothes shop			0
the film crew arrived in town over the @entity90 weekend , and the familiar shop fronts and neat parking spaces began to be replaced by dirt - covered roads , rickety carts and wandering horses			1
tell - tale signs of the modern age , such as phone boxes and road signs , were cleverly hidden inside wooden shacks , or temporarily removed			1
the changes took just one weekend to complete , and took many residents by surprise			0
one told @entity104 at the time : ‘ it ’s exciting , i did n’t know it was happening			0
i ’ve just come down to the jeweller ’s and found it all changed			0
’ rope store that 's really a flower shop : @entity114 's flower show may have been in @entity51 for 25 years but there was no space for it in @entity47 's @entity12			1
@entity118 turn it into a store for fishing equipment , the tv crew covered over the modern florist 's shop with a weathered wooden casing and accessorised it with benches , baskets , fishing tackle and coils of rope			1
you can almost smell the sea ... @entity134 's that 's really a baby boutique : @entity138 the wheelwright 's is actually a children 's clothes shop , so the colourful shop front had to be boarded over and the nearby modern metal gate hidden behind panelling			2
the road was covered and the pavement intentionally scuffed to turn back the centuries			0
a panoply of wheelwright 's instruments were placed in front of the 18th - century store shed that 's a phone box : a phone box was cleverly hidden in a wooden shed and a hay cart added to complete the rustic look filming took just a week and people were allowed to use the @entity67 between scenes , as many businesses stayed open			1
a council spokesman said any shops which saw trading hit by the temporary intrusion were compensated by the production company			0
‘ most people loved it , and thoroughly enjoyed the experience			0
over the course of a week , more and more people came to watch			0
’ with more than six million viewers tuning in to each of the first three episodes of the series , @entity47 ’s brooding leading man @entity173 has garnered a legion of breathless fans			0
that success means it may not be long before tourists are beating a path to @entity51 , which has already played host to other high - profile productions , including @entity185 and @entity186			2
its latest transformation was so impressive that a special photography exhibition has been arranged by the council showcasing the @entity67 before and during filming			0
it ’s on display in the town hall and closes on friday — two days before the next bodice - ripping instalment of @entity4 .			2

how the team behind @entity14 's @entity4 transformed @entity51 in @entity80 into 18th - century @entity12 in @entity30
shop fronts and neat parking spaces were replaced by dirt - covered roads , rickety carts and wandering horses
tell - tale signs of the modern age were cleverly hidden or temporarily removed - all in just one weekend
