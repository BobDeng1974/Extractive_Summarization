thought the vampire face lift and leech facial were weird ? the beauty industry is about to get much more bizarre			2
foreskin facials are the latest unconventional beauty treatment to be hitting salons - and people who 've had them ca n't stop singing their praises			1
dubbed a @entity9 , the treatment , which costs around $ 150 ( £ 100 ) and uses stem cell from an infant 's foreskin , is currently available in @entity14			1
speaking to @entity31 about the unusual treatment , dr. @entity29 , a leader in regenerative science , said : ' when we 're born , our skin is in its best shape			1
our cells naturally secrete proteins known as growth factors that keep the cells healthy and stimulate them to divide			2
one writer who had the treatment hailed its benefits and described her post-facial confidence as being at ' beyonce levels ' and her skin as glowing as @entity47 's , right ' as we age , our cells divide at a slower rate , which contribute to the telltale signs of aging , like wrinkles and loss of firmness and luminosity			1
growth factors captured from the donated foreskin of a baby ( just one can generate over a million treatments ) are at their peak ability in promoting rapid cell turnover			2
' @entity62 topically , they spur adult skin cells to regenerate			1
this is said to have a smoothing effect on the skin			2
' the 30 - minute treatment involves a cleansing process using salicylic - and - glycolic - acid peel and an extraction to remove blackheads and dead skin			1
this process is followed by a mask packed with hydrating hyaluronic acid and a serum with foreskin extracts and rounded off with some light therapy			0
one writer , @entity79 , who had the treatment hailed its benefits , describing her post-facial confidence as at ' beyonce levels ' and her skin as glowing as @entity47 's			1
the 30 - minute treatment ( not pictured ) involves a cleansing process using salicylic - and - glycolic - acid peel , an extraction , a mask packed with hydrating hyaluronic acid and a serum with foreskin extracts commenting on the trend , @entity93 - @entity92 , non-surgical director at @entity95 , told @entity97 : ' @entity9 , commonly known as the " @entity98 " is an interesting concept and is one that we will be keeping our eye on here at transform			1
' we ’ve seen a whole host of faddish non-surgical treatments coming over from the @entity107 - last year it was the vampire facial , which had a celebrity fan base , with the likes of @entity111 openly talking about having had the treatment			0
this year , it seems to be the @entity114 , but we often find that these extreme treatments seem to disappear as quickly as they come			0
' it ’s no surprise , as there are numerous new treatments hitting the market all the time , particularly ones with the " wow " and shock factor , but how effective they actually are is questionable			0
we ’ll have to wait and see			0
' if you want to keep your skin looking its best , it ’s important to maintain a good skincare regime which involves limiting sun exposure , avoiding smoking and excessive drinking , which can dehydrate the skin and accelerate the ageing process			0
' we would urge anyone who is considering having a non-surgical treatment , to do their research and be confident with what ’s on offer and that the person providing the treatment is appropriately qualified			0
also , it ’s important for patients to manage their expectations when it comes to the results			0
' the ' baby foreskin facial ' will , however , never be coming to the @entity145 as it is illegal to use human cells in cosmetic procedures			2
the @entity107 - owned company are currently in the process of creating the same effect , by using plant extract and bringing that to the @entity145 .			0

dubbed a @entity9 , the treatment is currently available in @entity14
key ingredient is stem cells from an infant 's foreskin
