@entity11 @entity1 , 25 , turned up armed with a set of tools ready to steal the plaque off the @entity16 memorial in @entity4 but was caught in the act by @entity18			1
police arrived and caught the would - be thief red handed as he attempted to prise the plaque from the ground			1
he was jailed for 18 - weeks at @entity25 for trying to steal the metal plaque that forms part of the @entity28 - a memorial to the victims of the @entity4 bombing in 1993			1
the incident happened just weeks before another attempt when thieves successfully stole an @entity35 - size plaque from the memorial honouring @entity37 , 12 , and @entity38 , 3 , that could have been sold for scrap for as little as £ 30			1
@entity37 's heartbroken mother @entity42 said : ' whether he knew what it was for or not , there ’s no reason to take a plaque to make money - any kind of plaque whether it be one on a grave or a memorial , it ’s stealing			1
i hope people will think twice about what they are doing			0
' it might just be a piece of metal but to us it has an impact , because somebody ’s life has been taken and people need to think about why it is there			2
' it is terrible for the families , people may just walk past it but to the families it is important			0
' the death of the two boys touched the heart of the nation and @entity37 's father @entity77 , 65 , received an obe for his peace campaigning after the atrocity			2
but despite its emotional significance the memorial to the young victims of the 1993 bombings has been repeatedly targeted by thieves in recent months attempting to exploit the soaring value of scrap metal			1
after the first memorial was stolen - sometime between april 20 and may 5 - mr @entity37 condemned the thieves			1
he said : ‘ it beggars belief that people can be so heartless and i do n’t expect that they have any conscience			0
‘ it is remarkable the lengths that some people will go to make some cash and it is one of those crimes that is so off the scale that it is disgusting			0
’ the theft comes as war memorials , lead from church roofs and cables from railway lines have been targeted across the @entity108			2
each year , at least 15,000 tons of the 13 million tons of metal sent for scrap is believed to be stolen , worth an estimated of £ 800million a year			1
memorial : this @entity28 runs down @entity111 , @entity4 , in honour of the two boys killed in the 1993 @entity10 bomb blast bombing victims : @entity38 , aged three , and @entity37 , 12 , who were killed in the blast in @entity4 in 1993 the court was told how @entity1 had hoped to steal the plaque in @entity4 town centre with the aid of another man and sell it on to a scrap metal merchant			1
but he was caught on @entity18 approaching the @entity28 water feature preparing to steal the plaque and police were dispatched to the scene			1
@entity127 , prosecuting , said : ' it was clearly a very motivated offence			0
@entity18 shows that he employed several techniques to try and remove the plaque through brute force			2
the @entity18 sees him prise the plaque while the co-accused keeps a look out			0
@entity42 and @entity77 , parents of @entity37 who was killed in @entity10 bombing at @entity4 , welcomed the sentencing of @entity11 @entity1 ' however , the lookout has not been able to give him sufficient warning , and the police officers find them to be in possession of a number of tools the significant of which links to pre-meditation			1
' there was a screwdriver , an eight inch silver wrench and another 3inch screw driver			0
the officers noted that the plaque has been loosened by the time they had arrived			0
' the defendant was taken into custody where he made a full admission in interview			0
the co-accused was given a warning and let off			0
the court heard how @entity1 had already received a 10 month custodial sentence in may for a burglary offence in december			2
miss @entity127 added : ' @entity1 has a majority of offences of dishonesty including the house burglary for which he is now serving			2
' the majority of offences have resulted in custodial sentences			0
the co-accused was a man of previous good character and for that reason was given a caution			0
' @entity175 magistrate chairman @entity174 said : ' we have had to take quite a bit of time to think about the right way to deal with this case			0
although on paper it is a relatively straight forward theft of a piece of metal - it is more than that to the people who are affected by it			2
' our view is that this was a theft where there was quite a degree of planning , so our point of view makes it more at the serious end of thefts			0
' @entity198 thefts are becoming more common and because of the nature of this theft and the impact on the community it makes it more serious			0
' we accept that it is likely that you do not understand the significance of what you were trying to steal at the time but you went deliberately to steal			0
' blast : the scene is cordoned off after two litter bins exploded outside a @entity213 store and a @entity214 campaigner : @entity77 , father of @entity4 bomb victim @entity37 , with former secretary of state for northern ireland dr @entity216			1
he is pictured at a peace centre in @entity4 he set - up after his son 's death after @entity1 ’ sentencing , mrs parry - mother of @entity37 - said : ' i think he got what he deserved and i ’m pleased that he has got the sentence that he got			1
maybe other people thinking about doing something like this will think twice			0
' i always find these sorts of things quite sad because the person who is stealing it is desperate , but the fact that he did it just to make money makes him a greedy person ' father 's anguish : @entity77 and his son on holiday , a year before @entity37 was killed at the age of 12			1
the plaque ( right ) put up in memory of @entity37 and the other victim @entity38 , 3 , that was stolen by scrap metal thieves stolen : this is where the bronze memorial plaque which paid tribute to the two boys killed in the @entity10 blast was placed			1
police are today hunting for the people who took it referring to the plaque that was successfully stolen , she said : ' the community has been very upset by it and we have been amazed by the amount of people who have rang us and offered to pay or a new one			1
we could have replaced it 100 times over , so we have asked people to make a donation to the charity instead			0
' police added that metal thefts are increasing across the @entity108 and are not a ' victimless ' crime			1
chief superintendent @entity269 , of @entity266 , said : ' metal theft comes in many forms and affects everyone			0
' it is not a victimless crime - in this case the repercussions are far reaching as the plaque , which the offender tried to steal , forms part of a memorial to the victims of the @entity4 bombing			1
' this is an important memorial for the community in @entity4 and is part of the town 's heritage			1
' metal theft is a national issue and we will continue to work with local partners , the community , businesses and other police forces to target those responsible			2
' the @entity4 bombings consisted of two separate attacks – the first in february 1993 at a gas storage facility and the second the following month in the centre of the @entity266 town			2
in the second attack , @entity301 received a coded message wrongly stating a bomb would be detonated in @entity305			0
in the event , there were two blasts , in litter bins outside @entity213 and @entity310 , within a minute of each other causing carnage and confusion			0
@entity38 was killed almost instantly and @entity37 was so badly injured his parents later had to take the agonising decision to turn off his life support machine			1
more than 50 other victims were injured , with many suffering serious shrapnel wounds and cuts and lacerations from flying glass			0
the stolen bronze plaque was put up in 1996 alongside a water feature in part designed by local schoolchildren .			2

@entity1 was caught red - handed trying to steal a metal plaque off the 1993 @entity4 bombing memorial
the @entity11 thief hoped to sell it as scrap metal prices soar across @entity108
police still hunting thieves of another plaque stolen from same memorial honouring @entity37 , 12 , and @entity38 , 3 , who were killed in 1993 blast
