by @entity0 published : 11:40 est , 25 july 2013 updated : 02:13 est , 26 july 2013 well looked after : former @entity2 controller @entity1 , who was handed a £ 500,000 golden parachute when he quit the @entity2 in disgrace in 2007 the @entity2 has been accused of acting like a ‘ cosy cartel ’ after revelations it handed a £ 500,000 payoff to an executive who quit in disgrace over doctored documentary footage of the @entity11			1
@entity1 , who ran @entity2 for two years , wrongly claimed a trailer showed the monarch storming out of a tetchy 2007 photo shoot with renowned @entity16 photographer @entity15			1
in fact the footage was of her majesty arriving for the sitting			1
the ensuing row , dubbed @entity23 , saw accusations fly between @entity25 and the @entity2 and claims that the monarch had been turned into a laughing stock			2
he quit three months later after being criticised by a damning report into the affair			0
at the time the @entity2 refused to say whether he received a payoff			2
according to @entity33 , @entity1 – who is now @entity35 ’s director of television - was handed ‘ about half a million pounds ’ in severance pay when he left			1
@entity38 mp @entity37 , who sits on the public accounts committee of mps , criticised the payment yesterday			0
he said : ‘ it is remarkable that someone who failed to stop a falsely edited trailer which smeared @entity11 and was criticised in a @entity2 internal review should be able to walk away with a public money pay off rather than face disciplinary action			1
‘ it illustrates a cosy cartel at the top of the @entity2 who are acting like an out of touch politburo rather than the guardians of public money			2
’ it emerged yesterday the @entity2 ’s new director general @entity58 – who recently admitted the corporation had ‘ lost the plot ’ over severance pay - has asked his staff to give him a ‘ detailed briefing ’ about the @entity64 deal			1
the news came as the government spending watchdog revealed it has reopened an investigation into @entity2 severance deals			1
earlier this month , the @entity69 revealed the corporation handed its staff £ 369million in golden goodbyes over eight years			0
its initial report only investigated a sample of 60 recent cases out of a total of 150			0
nearly a quarter of those received more than they were contractually entitled to			0
but following pressure from @entity40 , it has agreed to look into the files of 90 more senior managers given severance deals in the three years up to december 2012			0
it will present its findings to the public accounts committee before a second hearing into the debacle on september 9			0
misleading : scenes from a trailer for a year with @entity11 , which mr @entity1 claimed showed her storming out of a photo shoot with renowned @entity16 photographer @entity15			1
in fact the footage showed her arriving the @entity2 has so far resisted calls to identify the majority of cases identified by the @entity69 , citing data protection rules			1
but the committee have threatened to use parliamentary powers to call director general @entity58 before the @entity104 for an official ‘ admonishment ’ unless he complies with a parliamentary order to release the information			0
the committee ’s chair , @entity108 mp , said she hopes to publish the names of all those who received more money than they were contractually entitled to			0
in 2011 , @entity1 said his role at the @entity2 had been a ‘ lovely job because ... you are given , bluntly , quite a lot of money to spend ’			1
he was responsible for handing presenter @entity118 his infamous £ 18million contract in 2006			0
the @entity2 refused to discuss the details of the case yesterday , but said : ‘ whilst the @entity2 does not publicly discuss individual contracts , the @entity2 director general @entity58 has asked for a detailed briefing about the facts of this reported case as soon as possible			2
’ a spokesman for @entity1 said : ‘ he is not in a position to comment			2
