protecting his name : @entity2 filed a patent application for the phrases ' i am @entity6 ' and ' justice for @entity6 ' the mother of slain @entity9 recently filed a trademark to protect the rights to his name as an attempt to control - and collect funds from - the masses of merchandise being produced in support of their cause			1
it was revealed today that @entity2 , the boy ’s mother , filed two petitions last week to the @entity23 to specifically gain the rights to the phrases ‘ @entity25 ’ and ‘ @entity26 ’ , both of which have been frequently used by protesters across the country			1
the trademark application shows that she is specifically looking for control of the use of those phrases on cds and dvds that feature her deceased son			1
interestingly , the application makes no mention of other merchandise that may use those phrases , and t - shirts and hoodie sweatshirts are notably absent from the listing , meaning that she would not collect any monetary payment if someone were to sell clothes with those words on them			0
a wide variety of t - shirts , pins , buttons and banners are being sold in @entity55 and have been ever since the fatal shooting of 17 - year - old @entity9 became a national issue , flaring fraught racial tensions throughout the state and the country			0
the sale of merchandise has sped up in recent weeks , and will likely continue strong as rallies continue to be held in @entity64 , @entity55 , where the incident occurred on february 26			0
scroll down for the video demanding answers : ms @entity2 ( center ) and her ex-husband @entity73 ( pointing ) appeared in a @entity64 , @entity55 city hearing on monday as the push for action continues calling for action : supporters have made a plethora of different t - shirts , all with the same essential message shirts with the phrases that ms @entity2 just trademarked are available for sale online for $ 20 to $ 25 each			2
most of the t - shirts call for the arrest of the teen ’s shooter , @entity87 , though one that was revealed on monday goes a step further			0
local rapper @entity90 was photographed in a t - shirt with ‘ @entity93 * * @entity94 ’ surrounding a photo of @entity87 , using a lyric from one of his songs about a judge who gives large sentences to black defendants			0
other t - shirts chose to stick to the facts of the case , saying that the teen only had a pack of @entity108 and a bottle of iced tea on him at the time of the altercation			0
some , including former @entity114 leader @entity113 , feel that the attention surrounding the case has turned it away from the actual issues at hand and created a circus around the tragic death of a child			1
specifically reverend @entity113 called out @entity124 @entity123 and @entity125 for exploiting the case to increase their own profiles			2
continued fight : the family 's lawyers arranged a large march through @entity64 on monday with many supporters wearing t - shirts with the slain teen 's image wearing the message : shirts and hoodies honoring @entity6 are available for sale throughout @entity55 and the @entity141 ‘ his family should be outraged by the fact that they ’re using this child as the bait to inflame racial passions , ’ mr @entity113 told @entity142			2
he added that the two famed community leaders are ‘ acting as though they are buzzards circling the carcass of this young boy ’			1
the trademark application was handled by a different team of lawyers than the ones representing ms @entity2 and her ex-husband @entity73			1
@entity158 and @entity159 were the two lawyers from the @entity162 , @entity55 firm @entity161 who filed the application			2
exploitive ? one former @entity114 leader says that the @entity166 ( center ) and @entity125 ( right ) are exploiting the pain of @entity6 's parents ( ms @entity2 on the left and mr @entity9 on the right ) it cost $ 325 to file each of the patent and trademark applications , and it does not specify how much ms @entity2 stands to make off of each time someone violates the trademark			1
ms @entity2 's lawyer , ms @entity178 , told the @entity179 that the money that will be gathered from the trademark will go to ' projects that will assist other families who experience similar tragedies '			1
she denied that ms @entity2 had any intention of profiting from the move			0
the legal team handling the trademarks are completely separate from the firm of @entity190 and @entity191 who are representing the family and collecting donations from the public for their legal fees			0
over the weekend , @entity6 ’s parents urged supporters to make sure they were not donating to a string of fake sites that claim to be associated with the cause , but instead only give to those at @entity190 and @entity191			0

@entity2 filed a patent application to trademark ' i am @entity6 ' and ' @entity26 '
former @entity114 leader calls @entity211 and @entity125 ' buzzards circling the carcass of a young boy '
