@entity11 and @entity12 – who had recently suffered a brain aneurism – were killed after walking onto the tracks together in @entity15 on sunday			1
it was initially thought it was a double suicide , but police now believe @entity12 ’s condition meant she did not know what was going on and the whole event was planned by her husband			1
died together : @entity11 and @entity12 , both 59 , had been married for 42 years			1
police said they are now investigating the deaths as murder - suicide as it is believed that @entity12 was too disabled to make a decision to end her life mr @entity29 , 59 , had been struggling to cope with the stress of looking after his disabled wife , 59 , who had apparently been ‘ functioning like a toddler ’ since the aneurism in january			1
he left a suicide note in his car and called his heartbroken son , @entity36 , two minutes before the impact of the speeding train , telling him he loved him and he and he was sorry			1
devastated school teacher @entity36 said : ‘ he called me at 1:35 , and at 1:37 , they were dead			2
' witnesses say they saw mr @entity29 driving up and down the road at the scene of the accident – in @entity45 , @entity15 - up to 30 times before he parked his car and walked in front of the train with his wife			1
state trooper @entity50 , told @entity6 : ‘ we are still trying to piece everything together from that day , but it appears mr @entity29 brought his ill wife to that area and that it was a pre-planned event			1
‘ he had left a suicide note in the vehicle and contacted his son on the phone basically saying i am sorry for what i am about to do			1
‘ we are not sure if his wife knew about this , that is something we are trying to work out with the doctors , because we do n’t know what her mental capacity was at the time , but it appears to be a murder - suicide			2
‘ it seems he had this planned , he waited for the train , he held onto her and as the train comes , they both get struck and killed by the train			0
end scene : state police troopers said surveillance footage shows that mr @entity29 ignored a warning horn and looked to be purposefully waiting until the exact time that the train was approaching to get on the tracks ‘ it is still something we are trying to determine , but at this point it certainly appears that she may not have known that this was the plan that day and that he might have planned to do this for whatever reason			1
‘ i am trying to be as discreet and respectful to the family as possible , but at the same time , the facts apparently show that this was more - or-less his plan			2
this is based on security footage and witnesses			0
‘ we interviewed the conductor and it seems that everything he told us was factual and true			0
the family have been notified of our findings , they are handling a tragedy of losing both parents			0
’ he added : ‘ it appears from witnesses who live near the tracks that they had been driving around the area for some time , and it appeared to them that they had been waiting for the train to arrive			2
‘ at this point , there is obviously no one to prosecute , so the case would be closed and the family would be notified			0
i think that may happen this week			0
we try to wrap things up as quickly as possible for the family ’s sake ’			0
mr @entity50 said that it is not clear why mr @entity29 chose that particular point in the train 's path , as @entity45 is about six miles away from their hometown of @entity127			2
but it is clear that the stress of his wife ’s deteriorating health was weighing down heavily on his shoulders since she was diagnosed with the brain aneurysm in late january			1
she spent a month in intensive care and underwent several surgeries , the most recent only two weeks ago			0
her two sons , @entity36 , and husband visited her constantly but struggled to see her in pain as her motor functions and abilities were reduced to that of a toddler			2
@entity36 explained to @entity144 that his mother was n't the person she had been before the aneurysm , saying she would start a conversation and get lost , that she did n't always understand what was happening around her and she struggled to use the bathroom on her own			0
even in her final moments , when mr @entity29 put his wife on the phone with @entity36 , he said ' i 'll see you soon ' and he was unable to understand her response , which he said was common after the diagnosis			1
close : @entity29 ( right ) said that his father ( left ) had been stressed in the wake of @entity12 's brain aneurism and ensuing operations then mr @entity29 got on the phone			1

' the couple – who had four grandchildren - met when they were 17 - years - old and had been married for 42 years at the time of their death			1
mr @entity29 rearranged his work schedule at the @entity186 bookstore so that he started at 3.30am and was able to finish earlier in the afternoon in order to spend more time with his ailing wife			2
mrs @entity12 was apparently the perfect grandmother , loving nothing more than having tea parties or playing in the snow with her beloved grandchildren			2
