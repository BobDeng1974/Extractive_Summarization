' i think there 's another two transfer windows of similar amounts of money needed - maybe £ 100m - before they can even think about winning the title			1
' there are still key positions in the team that need filling			0
i think the centre - back position is obviously the key area			2
holding midfield or centre midfield needs addressing too			0
' there were no world - class centre backs out there ( this summer )			0
i think that 's why in the next two transfer windows , @entity1 might still be looking for that world - class defender			2
