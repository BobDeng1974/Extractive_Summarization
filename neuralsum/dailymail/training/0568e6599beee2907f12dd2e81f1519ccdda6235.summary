' this effort to pacify the favelas is a failure , the police violence is only replacing what the drug gangs carried out before			1

following the discovery of the body , angry residents began lighting fires throughout the slum and tossing homemade explosives , bottles and other objects down onto @entity48 's main avenues			2
