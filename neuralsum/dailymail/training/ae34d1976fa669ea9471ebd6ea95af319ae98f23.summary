by @entity0 , chief political correspondent accusation : former teachers said mr @entity2 was ' a fascist ' and ' a racist ' when he attended @entity4 @entity2 was last night accused of having been a racist when he was a schoolboy			1
the claim came as he prepared to tell his party that leaving the @entity8 was the ‘ only way ’ to deal with the pressures of immigration			2
on the eve of the @entity16 @entity15 ’s conference today , @entity12 broadcast comments from teachers at @entity4 that the teenage @entity2 was a ‘ fascist ’ and a ‘ racist ’ when a pupil at the private @entity22 school in the late 1970s and early 1980s			1
a letter from 1981 claims mr @entity2 , now 49 , was even heard ‘ shouting @entity25 songs ’			1
the claims did not prevent him being appointed as a prefect at the school			0
the @entity15 leader last night played down the significance of the claims , which he said were made by left - wing teachers who disliked his views			2
he denied singing @entity33 songs			2
mr @entity2 said : ‘ yes of course i said some ridiculous things , not necessarily racist things			1
it depends how you define it			0
‘ you ’ve got to remember that ever since 1968 up until the last couple of years , we ’ve not been able in this country , intelligently to discuss immigration , to discuss integration , it ’s all been a buried subject			0
’ he added : ‘ was i a difficult , bolshie teenager who pushed the boundaries of debate further than i should ? yes			1
have i ever been a member of an extremist organisation ? no , i have not			2
’ mr @entity2 was backed last night by a former @entity4 master @entity50 , who said the complaints were ‘ probably a reflection on the staff , not on him – there was quite a strong left - wing element ’			1
mr @entity2 will attempt to put the claims behind him when he addresses his party ’s conference in @entity22			1
he will tell activists @entity15 is poised to cause a political ‘ earthquake ’ if it can top the poll in next year ’s @entity63 elections			0
education : mr @entity2 attended @entity4 , a private school in south - east @entity22 and he will urge the party to put the issue of immigration from the @entity8 at the heart of its campaign – and use it to press the government to block the free access of migrants from @entity75 and @entity76 , due to start at the beginning of next year			1
‘ that is my challenge to them			0
if they ignore it we must turn the euro elections into the referendum that we have not been given , ’ he will say			0
he will insist @entity15 is not against all immigration , but that ‘ sheer weight of numbers ’ is putting too much strain on public services and driving down wages for the low - skilled			0
immigration from @entity76 and @entity75 will also see crime gangs flooding in to @entity16 , he will add.but he will say the main parties are powerless to deal with the issue as clamping down on @entity8 immigration is against @entity97 rules .			0

teachers who knew @entity2 as a pupil said he was ' a *facist* ' and ' a racist '
said he would shout @entity25 songs
mr @entity2 denied being an extremist , but *admitted* he sometimes ' pushed the boundaries of debate further than i should '
