former fan favourite @entity0 has backed under - fire @entity2 skipper @entity1 to bring the good times back to @entity4 , while warning the @entity5 faithful that @entity7 is not the answer			1
it has been more than seven years since the diminutive @entity10 bid an emotional farewell to his adoring @entity2 fans to rejoin @entity13			0
it was a successful three - year stint on @entity15 for the @entity17 graduate , with @entity19 glory in dramatic circumstances on that memorable night in @entity21 in 2005 being the pinnacle			1
@entity0 ( right ) played alongside @entity1 for three seasons in the red of @entity2 @entity1 sits dejected after the 1 - 1 draw with @entity26 consigned his side to an early @entity19 exit @entity7 guided @entity2 to @entity19 glory in 2005 ( above ) but he not the answer to @entity2 's current problems , says @entity0 who played under the @entity32 coach at @entity4 @entity0 , now 36 , has recently come out of retirement to ply his trade in @entity36 ’s inaugural @entity35 for @entity37 , with the tournament heading into a title play - off in the coming weeks			1
despite his current intentions to keep his weary legs in shape to compete amongst much younger opposition in the @entity44 , @entity0 admits to keeping a watchful eye on events back in @entity47			2
and @entity0 is especially disheartened by a mounting media maelstrom over whether an aging @entity1 still has what it takes to compete at the highest level			2
' @entity52 is the captain , the leader , he has to play , ' said @entity0			1
the @entity10 left @entity2 to join @entity13 in 2007 after three years on @entity15 ' so many of the players look up to him because of what he does on the pitch and what the club means to him			2
' even though when i was there he was much younger , he still had a presence on the pitch , and he has not lost that			0
' lose him you lose the soul of the team			0
he will make the other players up their game , and that is what you need from your captain			0
the @entity73 season went from bad to worse on tuesday night as @entity1 ’s late equaliser at home to @entity77 outfit @entity74 was not enough to spur his side on to the victory they needed to progress to the knockout stages of @entity83 ’s premier competition			1
@entity0 wheels away to celebrate after his scored ' that goal ' against @entity86 in the @entity19 such a disappointment has increased the already intense pressure on boss @entity89 , despite last season ’s exploits			1
talk around @entity4 of former boss @entity7 making a sensational return to the club , who he guided to that fifth @entity19 crown in @entity97 , has surfaced as a result of the @entity73 ’ predicament			1
the @entity10 's family still reside on @entity15 , and with his contract running down at @entity102 , and fans yearning for the glory days to return , @entity7 could prove to be a popular choice			2
however , @entity0 is not convinced the move would suit either party , insisting that age - old decree when considering returning to the scene of such success should be adhered to			2
@entity0 is overjoyed at the final whistle after the @entity73 ' remarkable comeback victory over @entity113 in @entity21 ' never go back , ' adds @entity0 , who will skipper his new side in the upcoming @entity116 play - offs			1
' i do n’t think @entity7 will ever go back as a manager			0
maybe something else , director of football or something			0
' to go back after winning the @entity19 and many other trophies and struggle to turn things around would be a bad move			2
' he is like a @entity126 in @entity2			0
' @entity0 ( left ) celebrates after scoring against @entity127 with @entity128 ( centre ) and @entity130 the question on everyone ’s lips when in the company of the ubiquitous midfielder is whether he believes his infamous ' ghost goal ' in the @entity19 semi-final second leg at @entity4 was over the line			1
' yes , yes it was a goal , ' @entity0 states			1
' it does not annoy me when i get asked , i like it			0
' i had the same thing here in @entity36 in our opening match , but it was disallowed			0
i knew it had gone in , as i did against @entity86			0
' you can follow @entity150 on @entity151 @ @entity152			0
