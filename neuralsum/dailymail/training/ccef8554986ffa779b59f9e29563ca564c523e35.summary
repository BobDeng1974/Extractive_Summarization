by @entity0 art teacher @entity1 is a picture of beauty as a @entity6 @entity5 contestant , but her modelling career only came about after her rugby dream was cut short			1
the 22 - year - old self - confessed tomboy , who has just been crowned miss @entity10 , was tipped as a future star of the women 's game until a serious shoulder injury forced her to quit			1
the stunning 6ft blonde had dreamed of sporting fame after being discovered at university and even played in a @entity20 7s tournament			1
after turning out for the first team at @entity22 , pictured here playing rugby , was tipped to become one of the greats of the game following her shoulder injury on the pitch , friends persuaded a reluctant @entity31 to compete for miss @entity10 and she was shocked to walk away with the crown but last week @entity31 , who now works as a teacher at @entity34 in @entity35 , @entity10 , swapped her rugby boots for stilettos as she entered her first beauty pageant - and walked away with the miss @entity10 crown			1
the title puts her in the running for the national miss @entity5 contest next month - and if she wins that , she would be in the running for @entity45			1
@entity31 , from @entity46 , @entity10 , said : ' it was weird because i was a tomboy and had my head in the game for so long			1
i thought i had lost my grace			0
' i always had the same dress i would chuck on for special events and i 'd do my hair			0
i 'd never get glammed up but when you do pageants , you realise how important that is for a girl			0
' i loved it from the beginning , you are with all the girls and they were all so chilled out			0
' i was over the moon when they called my name at miss @entity10			1
i just could n't believe it			0
now i am just buzzing for @entity5 , i ca n't wait			2
' there are a few obstacles before the competition - i just have to train well and get the right nutrition			2
' last week @entity31 , pictured centre after winning her miss @entity10 crown , swapped her rugby boots for stilettos as she entered her first beauty pageant @entity31 started playing rugby when she was 17 - scoring two tries on her debut for a local team			1
she picked up the sport at @entity80 and was put into the first team , taking part in the @entity20 7s tournament in summer 2012 as part of a social team			1
her side reached the semi-finals where they were beaten by the @entity89 national side			2
but it was @entity31 's last tournament as she injured her right shoulder at trials for the @entity94			2
she faced the choice of spending £ 6,000 on a private operation or two years on an @entity98 waiting list , so reluctantly gave up the game			0
@entity31 added : ' when i first started , my mum really did n't want me to play and i did n't realise i had the potential to be good			0
' the dubai 7s massively encouraged me to play professionally			2
i took so much pride in the fact i was good at what i was doing			0
@entity31 , who is currently working as an art teacher , is fundraising for @entity108 , a charity that helps children in poverty around the world ' you get bashed about a lot and you just deal with it			1
it is an old school mentality of just getting on with it			0
' i basically took the tackle and i went down on my shoulder			0
i thought it was a dead arm at first but it was actually torn tissue			0
' it is something that can be repaired with keyhole surgery			0
i did n't have the money or savings to drop in to and i did n't want to wait around for the surgery			0
' the first two months were some of the hardest of my life but then i decided to put it all behind me			0
' friends persuaded a reluctant @entity31 to take to the catwalk and she she was stunned when she was picked from more than 100 hopefuls to be named miss @entity10			1
if she wins the @entity5 competition she could be set to win £ 25,000 , a trip to @entity140 and a place in @entity45			1
@entity31 is fundraising for @entity108 , a charity that helps children in poverty around the world			1
she has already completed a 120 mile day - long bike ride and donations can be made at @entity147			2
