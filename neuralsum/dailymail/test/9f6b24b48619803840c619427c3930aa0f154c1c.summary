@entity1 's premier bowler @entity0 suffered a frustrating day in his bid to become his country 's all - time leading wicket taker in his 100th @entity6 appearance in @entity7			1
but pace attack colleague @entity8 believes the @entity10 celebration party is ' just around the corner ' as @entity12 fell to 155 for four in response to @entity1 's first - innings total of 399			1
@entity0 , watched by his parents , wife , two daughters and agent and needing four wickets to overtake the great sir @entity21 's haul of 383 , claimed only one early victim in @entity12 opener @entity23 in his 13 overs , which went for 24 runs and eight maidens			1
@entity0 moved to within two wickets of sir @entity21 's record of 383 test wickets @entity0 could only take the one wicket on day two of the first test in @entity7 but even the @entity1 back - room staff were surprised that @entity0 bowled just four overs in the last session of play with team - mates @entity37 , @entity39 and @entity40 sharing the other wickets to fall			1
it could have been better but a @entity44 wicket was ruled a no ball			0
@entity8 took a stunning slip catch off @entity40 to dismiss @entity12 vice-captain @entity47 , who claimed after play that he thought @entity0 ' looked tired '			1
but @entity8 said : ' @entity0 got us off and running with the first wicket and the rest of us tried to back that up , which i thought we did pretty well			1
if he keeps doing that and bowling the way he does those wickets are just around the corner			0
@entity8 jumps for joy after taking the wicket of @entity61 on the second afternoon @entity37 appeals for an lbw against @entity64 batsman @entity47 , but it was unsuccessful ' the stat is obviously there but i do n't think @entity0 or any of us are going about our cricket or thinking about things differently			1
' we 're just trying to group balls as a bowling unit and create pressure			0
' as a group we try and win every session , so we 'll come back as hard as we can to break this partnership then make inroads into the tail			0
' ironically , no 11 @entity0 and @entity8 were the pick of the lower - order @entity1 batsman in a last - wicket partnership of 38 as the @entity12 bowling attack , inspired by a talk from bowling coach sir @entity85 , captured the last five wickets for 58			1
@entity12 opener @entity47 did a good job of seeing off @entity0 in a challenging first spell and though he eventually fell for 39 , he enjoyed the test			2
@entity8 later took a stunning catch at first slip off @entity40 's bowling to dismiss @entity47 ' obviously when @entity0 started with the new ball it was moving a lot , so facing him then was a little more challenging			2
' but obviously he bowled a couple of overs before lunch as well so i do n't know if maybe he was a little bit tired			0
' it was a good challenge facing him when the ball is swinging both ways			0
the key is to keep as still as possible			0
' @entity47 's knock would probably have lasted longer had anyone other than the athletic @entity8 been stationed at slip , where he claimed a superb one - handed catch inches off the ground			2
@entity8 is , of course , @entity110 born - a fact not lost on @entity47			2
' it was @entity8 who caught me , a fella from here , so it was quite unlucky			0
' about his catch , @entity8 said : ' it was a reaction one but it rivals my best at this level			0

@entity0 claimed his 381st @entity6 wicket on *tuesday* in @entity7
the *32* - year - old dismissed @entity23 for 10 on day two of first test
@entity0 is still two wickets behind sir @entity21 's record of 383
@entity8 says that the record is ' just around the corner '
