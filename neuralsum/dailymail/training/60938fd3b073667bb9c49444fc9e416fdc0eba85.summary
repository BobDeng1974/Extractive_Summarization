by @entity0 published : 08:27 est , 12 april 2012 updated : 01:00 est , 13 april 2012 tragic : @entity1 died of dehydration and acute kidney failure after being sent home by doctors three times in three days a boy of 19 months died despite being seen by four doctors in three days , an inquest heard yesterday			1
@entity1 ’s parents begged for their son to be kept in hospital after he was admitted suffering severe diarrhoea and dehydration			1
but doctors there failed to carry out vital tests on the toddler , instead dismissing his illness and advising his parents , @entity20 and @entity21 , to take their son home			1
a fourth , from a @entity24 out - of - hours service , also failed to spot that @entity1 was seriously ill or refer him to hospital for treatment despite the fact the little boy appeared ‘ lifeless ’			1
instead @entity1 died at home in his sleep , four days after he was first taken to hospital			1
a post-mortem examination revealed he died of dehydration and acute kidney failure after suffering from an inflammation of the colon , which had not been spotted			0
coroner @entity35 criticised doctors at @entity37 and a @entity24 ’s out - of - hours service			0
horrifying : less than five days after his first trip to hospital , at 4am on may 1 @entity1 's father found him tragically dead in his bed she said he could have survived had he been re-admitted to hospital and given proper treatment			1
last night @entity1 ’s parents , who have two older sons , said he had died needlessly because of ‘ sub-standard ’ care			1
mrs @entity49 , 29 , said : ‘ i kept telling the medical staff that @entity1 was extremely sick but nobody would listen			2
three opportunities to save my son were wasted			0
’ a two - day inquest in @entity37 was told @entity1 fell ill at his home in the town on april 23 last year			2
mrs @entity49 , an administrative assistant , took him to his gp three days later and , on the doctor ’s advice , he was admitted to @entity37 later that evening			2
@entity1 was then examined by a paediatrician who said he was not dehydrated , but she recommended he be given @entity61 , a rehydration treatment to boost his salt and sugar levels			2
devastated : the traumatic experience of watching their son 's health deteriorate in less than a week will haunt parents @entity20 and @entity70 ( pictured ) ' for the rest of their lives ' at 10.30am the next day , a second doctor recommended @entity1 be discharged and his parents given ‘ 48 - hour open access ’ to the children ’s ward , which meant they could bring him back at any time			1
mrs @entity49 returned with him the next day			0
but a third doctor refused to believe he was dehydrated and sent him home			0
the next day – good friday – @entity1 ’s grandmother was so concerned that the toddler had ‘ sunken eyes ’ she phoned the hospital			1
but a nurse could not find @entity1 ’s notes which showed he had ‘ 48 - hour access ’			1
she told the family they would have to go through @entity89 or their @entity24 out - of - hours service , @entity91			0
out - of - hours gp @entity92 said the boy had a virus but was not dehydrated and did not need to go to hospital			0
the next day @entity1 was still poorly but seemed brighter			2
he went to bed at 9pm and was discovered dead in his cot in the early hours by his father			0
in a narrative verdict , mrs @entity35 described the disorganised arrangements for the ‘ open 48 - hour ward access ’ system as ‘ catastrophic ’			0
she blamed doctors ’ decisions not to weigh @entity1 or take blood and urine samples from him for their failure to diagnose his condition			2
mr and mrs @entity49 are suing ngh and have lodged complaints to the @entity110 about two of the doctors involved			0
the hospital has apologised and said changes had been made .			0
