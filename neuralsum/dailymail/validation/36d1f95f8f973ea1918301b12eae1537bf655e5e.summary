@entity0 has encouraged @entity2 ’s squad to make history and overcome the problems he believes are preventing @entity6 clubs from thriving in @entity7			1
@entity2 ’s sole @entity7 trophy came in the 1985 @entity9 and @entity0 wants to mark that anniversary by guiding his team to the @entity13 final			1
they will reach the last eight by avoiding defeat against @entity17 on thursday night			1
given how wretched their domestic form has been , few would have thought @entity2 could be the @entity21 ’s last @entity7 representatives and @entity0 feels they have overcome huge obstacles to get this far			1
@entity2 boss @entity0 has expressed concerns over the quality of @entity17 's pitch @entity2 players train ahead of their @entity13 round of 16 second - leg with @entity17 @entity2 currently lead the tie 2 - 1 on aggregate following their win at @entity33 in the first - leg @entity21 sides have won only five of the 28 @entity7 trophies possible since the turn of the millennium and the manager believes the punishing nature of the domestic competition is taking its toll			1
‘ our @entity45 competition demands every game to be 100 per cent , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ teams that play in other leagues in @entity7 , they cruise through games and get through at 50 per cent			2
it is unfair on @entity45 teams			2
‘ a break in the winter would enable the players to regenerate and refresh — a key period in the season is february and march so i think the biggest teams are a little bit unfairly treated			0
the answer is clear — you need to have a bigger squad at this level where you can make five or six changes to keep the team performing at the same level			0
with the pitch covered up , @entity2 players are made to train on the running track that surrounds it a cold night in @entity72 awaits @entity2 as they look to protect their 2 - 1 lead from the first leg @entity0 has warned that the poor quality pitch could be a problem for both @entity2 and @entity17 ‘ i find playing thursday and sunday is tough			1
the @entity13 teams should play at least at 4pm , and also be given as many home games as possible after they have been away			2
we should protect our teams a bit more , otherwise we shoot ourselves in the foot			0
’ progress in @entity72 will not be straightforward			0
@entity2 were unable to train on the @entity85 pitch last night as it was covered in huge white tarpaulins and had heat lamps ready to repair a surface reported to be rain - sodden			1
@entity0 , however , is not going to use the pitch as an excuse , as he is far more anxious about the threat @entity93 pose			1
@entity95 ’s side have not lost at home this season but @entity2 will not be cautious in their approach			2
an @entity2 coach leads the players in a series of stretches on the running track around the pitch @entity105 ( left ) sretches alongside @entity2 team - mate @entity106 ( right ) at the @entity85 ‘ we have got great memories of being in @entity7 this season , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ this experience has been fantastic and we want to progress			0
‘ it is an opportunity , something for us to enjoy rather than fear			0
we want to show everyone what we can do			0
’ there is little doubt the 2 - 1 first - leg win against @entity93 , followed by a 3 - 0 dismantling of @entity121 , has improved the atmosphere in the squad and helped restore confidence			1
‘ it was brilliant to get those two results back to back , ’ said @entity2 defender @entity125			2
‘ we have n’t been happy with our league form but it is turning			0
‘ we played ever so hard to get into this competition			0
our goal at the start was to win it			0
it has been a long time since the club won anything and it would be nice if we could change that			0
