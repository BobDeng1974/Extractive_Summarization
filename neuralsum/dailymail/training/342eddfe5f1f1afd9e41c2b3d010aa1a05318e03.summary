the hilarious creature may bear an uncanny resemblance to one of @entity7 's best loved children 's characters , but it 's not made of fur and it certainly does n't eat biscuits			0
in fact , this is a stove pipe sponge which is more likely to be found in warm @entity13 waters than @entity14			1
cookie - likey : this familiar face is actually that of a sea creature called the stove pipe sponge and although it 's a chip off the old block for the permanently hungry puppet , this curious sea creature would much rather be eating plankton than anything with chocolate chips			1
with its bulging ' eyes ' , wide mouth and blue appearance , the bizarre looking organism is a dead ringer for the famous @entity32 puppet			0
it was spotted by underwater photographer @entity34 , while he was diving in off the @entity35 @entity13			1
the real deal : the actual cookie monster first munched biscuits on our screens 1996 when he made his @entity14 debut speaking of his chance encounter with the @entity14 sponge , he said : ' i came across this unusual sponge configuration during a shoot on the @entity49 tip of @entity50			2
' it was clear that it was an unusual comical sponge and i was surprised no one had ever photographed it			2
' i lit it from top and side to create a more human like appearance and voila			0

the stove pipe sponge is more likely to be found in warm @entity13 waters
