by @entity1 reporter @entity3 auditors found 39 cases where female state prison inmates may not have understood they were submitting to medical procedures that would leave them sterile , according to a report released thursday			1
state law prohibits inmates from elective sterilizations as methods of birth control			1
however , prison officials allow sterilizations in cases deemed medically necessary			2
the audit was prompted by the @entity17 , which last year found that doctors sterilized nearly 150 female prisoners without obtaining proper consent			1
unaware : @entity3 auditors found 39 cases where female state prison inmates may not have understood they were submitting to medical procedures that would leave them sterile auditors confirmed 144 cases between 2006 and 2013 in which inmates had their fallopian tubes tied or cut for the sole purpose of birth control			1
the report identified 39 ' unlawful ' cases with apparent violations of state rules requiring inmates understand the nature and permanence of the procedures			1
the @entity36 reported that st least 11 of the 39 sterilized inmates were serving time at the @entity38 in @entity39			1
@entity40 , a spokeswoman for the @entity3 state auditor , said those ' tubal ligation ' sterilizations involved 17 doctors and eight hospitals			1
the sterilizations were performed by private doctors at facilities outside the prisons , which is typical , she said			0
the cases will be referred to @entity3 's medical board and the @entity53 , said @entity54 , a spokeswoman for the federal court - appointed official who controls prison medical care			1
state sen. @entity58 called the findings shocking			0
she said she fears that inmates may feel pressure to undergo sterilization			2
' the experience in and of itself is extraordinarily coercive , ' @entity63 said of obtaining health care behind bars			0
' it 's very difficult for a woman to exercise her free will under those circumstances			0
' @entity63 , a @entity71 from @entity72 , is the author of a bill that would make it clear that the state 's prisons and jails are prohibited from sterilizing inmates for the purpose of birth control			1
the measure passed the @entity82 36 - 0 last month and is before the @entity83			0
auditors said there was confusion over the prison policy			0
high concentration : at least 11 of the 39 sterilized inmates were serving time at the @entity38 in @entity39 the federal receiver 's office took control of prison medical care in 2006 , but said it did n't learn about the sterilization procedures until the legal advocacy group @entity95 raised the issue in january 2010			1
the receiver 's office previously said it immediately took steps to stop the practice			0
the report found one sterilization since then , in 2011 , but said the tubal ligation was medically necessary			2
but in 27 cases auditors found the inmate 's doctor did not sign a required consent form saying the patient appeared mentally competent , understood the permanent effect and had waited at least 30 days and no more than 180 days to reconsider			2
auditors were critical of the receiver 's office , saying it failed to make sure its staff obtained necessary approvals from inmates and from two medical procedure review committees before inmates were sterilized			2
they recommended that the federal receiver adopt better procedures to monitor its medical staff and the medical providers who work under contract with the state			0
that includes improving medical record - keeping and making sure inmates give their informed consent to medical procedures			0
@entity133 put a positive spin on the findings			0
' we are glad to see that our efforts to stop the practice have been successful , ' she said , adding the receiver 's office will work with auditors ' to improve our process further			0
