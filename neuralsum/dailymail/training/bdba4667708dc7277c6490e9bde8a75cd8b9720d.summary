by @entity0 published : 18:52 est , 24 february 2013 updated : 09:33 est , 26 february 2013 the owner of @entity2 faces a consumer backlash amid reports it is about to announce a 15 per cent increase in profits , taking the figure to some £ 2.8billion			1
figures to be announced by @entity10 on wednesday point to a profits bonanza on the back of spiralling bills for struggling customers			1
the profits at @entity2 , which put up prices by six per cent in the teeth of the winter chill , are predicted to be up by some 10 per cent to around £ 580million for 2012			1
profit bonanza : the parent company of @entity2 faces a backlash amid reports it is to announce a 15 per cent increase in profits on the back of spiralling bills for struggling customers the company is also under fire over payments to the departing @entity2 boss , @entity33 , who is predicted to walk away with a package of pay , shares and a pension pot together worth more than £ 10million			1
@entity10 has tried to pre-empt the furore by publishing a study boasting about its beneficial effects on the wider @entity42 economy in terms of employment , investment and the tax it pays			2
chief executive @entity47 said its contribution to the economy was equivalent to a city the size of @entity52 , and its tax bill amounted to £ 158 for every @entity42 household			0
‘ at a time of uncertain economic prospects , our activities across the @entity42 are even more important to secure employment , put the supply chain to work and contribute our fair share of tax , ’ he said			0
the company employs some 33,000 people in the @entity42 , while total tax paid is expected to rise from £ 891m in 2011 to around £ 1.1 billion in 2012			2
payout : @entity10 is also under fire over payments worth more than £ 10million to the departing @entity2 boss , @entity33 unlike most energy firms operating in the @entity42 , it is wholly @entity42 and pays its taxes in this country			1
most of its major rivals for @entity42 customers are foreign owned by @entity76 , @entity77 and @entity78 utility firms			2
while that may appeal to the patriotism of its 10 million @entity42 consumers , it does not make the pain of paying for heat and light any easier to bear			0
the national average gas and electricity bill is approaching £ 1,300 , while millions face a nightmare choice during cold spells between heating and eating			2
@entity2 claims a profit margin of some 5per cent - around £ 65 a year – which it insists is modest when compared to other businesses , such as supermarkets			1
the industry blames rising wholesale costs for higher bills , while it also points to expensive government ‘ green ’ initiatives , such as subsidising the building of wind farms and the installation of free insulation into the homes of vulnerable customers			0
the official customer body , @entity108 , says the public remain sceptical about whether they are paying a fair price			0
executive director at consumer champion , which ? , @entity114 , said : ‘ at a time when spiralling energy bills are consumers ’ top financial worry , people are bound to question whether they ’re paying a fair price for their energy when they see big profits announcements from the energy giants			0
‘ @entity10 ’s analysis wo n’t change that view as record - high bills land on millions of doormats in the coming weeks			2
’ the prime minister has announced that energy firms will be required to simplify their tariffs and move customers to the cheapest option			1
talking taxes : the prime minister has announced that energy firms will be required to simplify their tariffs and move customers to the cheapest option however , mr @entity114 said the proposals do not go far enough and it will remain extremely difficult for householders to identify the cheapest supplier			1
‘ the government should take more radical action to provide not just simpler but fairer bills			0
‘ prices will only be kept as low as possible if there is more effective competition and switching between energy companies			0
‘ for this to happen the price of every tariff should be presented in a clear , consistent and simple way , through single unit prices like those for petrol and diesel , so people can easily spot the cheapest deal - not just with their current supplier but across the market			0
