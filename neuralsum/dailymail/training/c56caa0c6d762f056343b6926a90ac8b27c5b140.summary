the benefits of the annual flu jab have been ‘ over-hyped ’ , scientists claim			1
they say the vaccine is far less effective than is widely believed , with some studies showing it protects less than two - thirds of the population			1
the @entity9 researchers say ministers in @entity11 as well as @entity9 are ‘ wasting taxpayers ’ money ’ on the jab			2
and they claim that because the benefits have been so ‘ over-promoted ’ , scientists have been deterred from inventing vaccines that would be far more effective			1
flu jabs are a waste of taxpayer 's money due to the protective effects of the vaccine being over-hyped , it has been claimed is the flu jab a waste of taxpayers ' money ? is the flu jab a waste of taxpayers ' money ? now share your opinion but the @entity33 has insisted the flu jabs ‘ save lives ’ and urged the elderly and patients with long - term conditions to come forward for their vaccinations			1
researchers from the @entity41 looked at 12,000 studies on the effectiveness and safety of the flu jab , going back to the 1930s			1
they say that although @entity49 officials claim it protects between 70 and 90 per cent of the population , this is actually not the case			0
in fact , they say , it protects just 59 per cent of adults aged 18 to 65 , but is far less effective in the elderly			0
professor @entity58 , who was involved in the study , said : ‘ i have been a strong proponent of vaccination in general , and flu vaccine in particular , for many years			1
i still recommend its use as the best we have			1
the report 's author , professor @entity58 , said he still recommended the vaccine , but its benefits were over-reported ‘ but we have over-promoted this vaccine			1
for certain age groups in some years its effectiveness has been severely limited relative to what has been previously reported			0
‘ that has had a very dampening effect on the development of new vaccines			0
’ and @entity79 , of the @entity80 ’ @entity81 in @entity82 , said : ‘ no vaccines are perfect			0
last year ’s flu vaccine was a bad match with the circulating strains			1
its effectiveness varies from year to year and with different age groups			0
‘ among the elderly it is widely recognised that its effectiveness decreases			0
better vaccines are needed for this reason particularly			0
it has been over-hyped by many people			1
’ at present the flu jab is offered free to the over- 65s , pregnant women and anyone with an underlying health condition such as asthma , diabetes or epilepsy			0
the immunisation programme is estimated to cost the taxpayer £ 115million a year			0
the latest figures from the @entity103 show that 61 per cent of the over- 65s have been vaccinated this year , as well as 30 per cent of pregnant women and 37.5 per cent of those with long - term conditions			2
a @entity33 spokesman said : ‘ there is no doubt that the flu programme saves lives			0
‘ evidence on the effectiveness of the vaccine is reviewed by the @entity115 and this year the committee undertook a detailed review of the flu vaccine programme			2
‘ we strongly encourage scientists and the vaccine industry in their efforts to develop new and more effective flu vaccine and do not agree that these efforts are being discouraged			2
‘ each year thousands of people die after catching flu and we urge everyone that is in an at - risk group to get the vaccine			1
’ professor @entity58 added : ‘ we support using flu vaccine in all age groups			2
even among the over- 65s , although it is of limited benefit , it is still a benefit			0

@entity41 report says benefits - especially for older people - have been over-promoted
new vaccine *pipeline* *hindered* as a result
but *experts* still recommend *current* vaccination ' as it 's the best we have '
