by @entity0 published : 09:03 est , 20 june 2013 updated : 12:12 est , 20 june 2013 some of @entity2 's most familiar names are full of hidden meaning			1
@entity5 is be the names of each of the 50 states to cities , countries , rivers , oceans and even mountain ranges , a map has been created with their etymological meanings			1
and so @entity17 becomes ' new @entity18 ' , @entity16 is ' @entity19 of @entity20 ' whilst @entity21 apparently means ' @entity22 '			2
not all that it seems : it looks like a normal map , but once you start reading , it becomes clear that the ' @entity28 ' is not at all conventional some of the state names have meanings that are far easier to determine			1
the map was designed by cartographers @entity31 and @entity33			1
many of the meanings are literal descriptions of the terrain or climate of the places they describe			0
@entity41 means nothing more than ' @entity43 ' and neighbouring @entity41 predictably means ' @entity45			0
' @entity46 , is the “ land of the @entity47 ' , and @entity48 is the ' land of the @entity50			0
' the @entity51 : who knew that @entity53 meant ' @entity54 ' or that @entity55 is ' @entity56 ' the @entity57 : @entity58 is ' @entity59 ' which is understandable because of all the rain the state receives but can anyone explain ' land of the @entity64 ' for @entity65 ? some import @entity68 elements			0
@entity70 's name is derived from the @entity72 word for @entity73 ( vert ) and @entity75 ( mont ) - hence it 's nickname ' @entity70 '			0
@entity80 means ' near the small big mountain ' in an @entity83 language			0
@entity84 are literal translations with ' @entity86 ' being the @entity88 word for ' friend ' or ' ally '			0
the map names the states as the ' @entity93			1
' @entity46 means ' large lake ' hence the map 's creators gave the state the name ' @entity99 '			1
' @entity17 ' is given as ' @entity100 ' which is based on the idea that @entity17 in @entity102 derives from @entity104 eofor ' wild boar ' and latin vicus village			1
however the meaning is open to interpretation because the @entity108 name @entity109 was itself derived from folklore			0
it meant ' place of yew trees ' so @entity17 could be interpreted as either a place ' boars ' or ' yews '			1
the true meaning : the map labels states , cities , and landmarks with the literal meanings of their official names further west , @entity126 means ' @entity127 ' , @entity125 perhaps surprisingly is ' @entity128 ' whilst @entity129 becomes ' @entity130 '			1
others are truly baffling ; take @entity65 's ' land of the @entity64 ' ' @entity133 ' apparently means ' @entity134 ' - does n't quite have the same charm as the ' @entity136 ' does it ? the map extends further afield to other countries too spawning some charming interpretations			2
@entity140 becomes the ' @entity141 ' , whilst @entity142 means ' the @entity143 '			0
the cartographers , @entity31 and his wife @entity145 , say they were inspired by @entity147 's maps of @entity148 , which include names like ' @entity150 ' and ' @entity151			2
' their world maps are filled with similarly descriptive toponyms			2
' we wanted to let the @entity148 tells its own story , ' says @entity31			0
@entity157 : there 's no disputing @entity161 's name as ' @entity162 ' there 's no wonder rainy @entity164 is ' @entity165 ' @entity166 : @entity142 is the poetically named ' @entity167 of the @entity168 ' and there 's few who would dispute @entity172 hospitality with the state 's meaning being ' @entity93 ' ' the names give you an insight into what the people saw when they first looked at a place , almost with the eyes of children			1
through the maps , we wanted to show what they saw			0
' mr @entity31 says that he included numerous caveats in the introduction to the atlas : ' not all translations are definitive			0
the reader may be offered a number of possible alternatives , or the translation may be prefixed by ‘ probably ’ or ‘ presumably ’			0
the atlas should n't replace a scientific work about etymology , it is meant as an invitation to the people to start looking at the world through fresh eyes			1
if you 're looking for mistakes , you 'll always find some , even in ordnance survey maps			2
just take the @entity28 as an idea to visualise the world of etymology to a broad audience at a glance			1
and these people have n't seen such a world before			2

' @entity28 ' is an etymological trip around the world .
the map *makers* **research*ed* global place names to find their *origins* , and then translated them to @entity104
most of the *research* for the names was done using books of etymology and the internet
