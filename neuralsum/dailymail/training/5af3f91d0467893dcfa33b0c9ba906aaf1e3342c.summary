by @entity0 the @entity1 has filed papers accusing @entity4 @entity3 , pictured , as being the leader of the gang behind the software the dangerous cyber pandemic known as @entity10 could have infected thousands of @entity12 computers and be lying dormant gathering data , experts say			1
the malware , which the @entity15 estimates has hit between 500,000 and one million computers worldwide , has resulted in users losing tens of millions of dollars			1
@entity10 , which experts say is ' sophisticated ' and capable of evading anti-virus software , infects a user 's machine when they open a @entity22 or click on a link sent to them in an email			1
once it is set up on the computer , @entity26 will intercept all financial transactions and rewrite them , so that payments made by the user will be redirected into other accounts			1
the malware also has the power to disguise unapproved payments that are made , meaning that thefts might have occurred even if accounts appear normal			1
' it keeps track of balances ; it automatically corrects the numbers on the balance			0
it 's so sophisticated that it hides its tacks , ' said @entity45 , senior principal systems engineer at @entity46			2
the malware has hit computer users around the world , with the most incidents reported in the @entity51 and @entity52 – 13 percent and 12 percent respectively			1
seven percent of incidents have occurred in the @entity54			0
there are no figures available on how many @entity12 computer users have had money stolen through the malware and mr @entity45 says this is because so far @entity10 ' has n't been targeting @entity12 financial institutions or users yet in any significant scale			1
' but mr @entity45 stated that many @entity12 users could have downloaded the virus already and it may be lying dormant on their machines ready to be activated at any moment			1
the @entity70 malware often comes into effect if the user is not a ' viable ' victim for @entity10 and the network can not access their financial details			1
@entity70 locks your computer , encrypts files and demands a ransom for them to be unlocked			2
' there 's really no alternative to getting files back after the infection [ except paying the ransom ] , ' said @entity91 , marketing manager for @entity92			0
' it ’s a really nasty piece of malware			2
' the @entity95 admitted that at least one police force has been forced to pay this ransom to release sensitive files			2
the @entity10 malware was shut down by an international police effort this week , spearheaded by the @entity15 , assisted by both the @entity101 and @entity46			1
this is the third attempt to shut down the malware , which first emerged in 2011 , and the @entity15 is reporting that users have two weeks to clean up their hard drives and install anti-virus software before the network responsible for @entity26 will be operational again			1
gameover @entity26 has been so difficult to shut down because it uses peer - to - peer software , meaning that even if the main server is shut down , infected computers can continue to communicate with one another and continue operating			1
another reason is that once installed on a computer , @entity10 has the ability to evade anti-virus software			1
' once it has infected [ a computer ] , it 's very hard to get it off , ' said mr @entity45			1
computers are often concurrently infected with @entity10 and a separate piece of malware , @entity70 , and there is some evidence linking the two pieces of malware back to the same eastern @entity127 network			1
the @entity70 malware often comes into effect if the user is not a ' viable ' victim for @entity10 and the network can not access their financial details			1
@entity70 then locks the information on the computer and holds it to ransom			2
at the moment the software demands one @entity138 , an untraceable form of online currency favoured by criminals , which is around £ 300 ( au $ 540 )			0
in the worst cases , victims could lose access to their bank accounts which could be systematically drained according to @entity46 data , three percent of people affected by the @entity70 malware pay the ransom rather than lose their files and paying the ransom seems to be the only way for users to gain access to their files once they have been attacked			1
' there 's really no alternative to getting files back after the infection			0
there 's not much we can do about it … without having the keys it 's virtually impossible to decrypt the files , ' said @entity91 , marketing manager for @entity92			0
the @entity95 admitted that at least one police force has been forced to pay this ransom to release sensitive files			0
earlier this week , the @entity1 filed papers accusing a @entity4 named @entity3 as being the leader of the gang behind the software			0
the complaint claims the software has been responsible for the loss of more than $ 100m from individuals and a string of major companies , with estimates that members of the gang behind the malware would have amassed tens of millions of dollars each			2
could @entity4 @entity3 , pictured , be the behind the global cyber virus pandemic ? he is the man suspected of being behind a gang that has sparked a global cyber virus pandemic			0
but the @entity15 has already spent years looking for @entity4 @entity3 who uses the online names ‘ lucky12345 ’ and ‘ slavik ’			0
the 31 - year - old is already wanted for his alleged involvement in a ‘ racketeering enterprise ’ that installed malicious software known as ‘ @entity26 ’ on victims ’ computers			2
the software was used to capture bank account numbers , passwords , personal identification numbers , and other information needed to log into online banking accounts			2
the @entity15 believes @entity3 knowingly acted in a role as an administrator while others involved in the scheme conspired to distribute spam and phishing emails , which contained links to compromised websites			0
victims who visited these web sites were infected with the malware , which @entity3 and others allegedly used to steal money from the victims ’ bank accounts			1
this online account takeover fraud has been investigated by the @entity15 since the summer of 2009			0
starting in september 2011 , the @entity15 began investigating a modified version of the @entity218 , known as @entity10 ( @entity219 )			2
it is believed @entity219 is responsible for more than one million computer infections , resulting in financial losses in the hundreds of millions of dollars			2
on august 22 , 2012 , @entity3 was indicted under the nickname ‘ lucky12345 ’ by a federal grand jury in the @entity225 on a number of charges including @entity228 , conspiracy to violate the @entity230 and @entity231			0
on may 19 , 2014 , @entity3 was indicted in his true name by a federal grand jury in the @entity234 on charges of @entity229 , @entity230 , @entity236 , @entity228 and @entity237			0
then just days ago on may 30 , a criminal complaint was issued in the @entity225 that ties the previously indicted nickname of ‘ lucky12345 ’ to @entity3 and charges him with conspiracy to @entity242			0
he is described as white with brown hair ( though his head is usually shaved ) and brown eyes			0
he is 5ft 9ins tall and weighs around 180 pounds ( 82kg )			0
@entity3 was last known to live in @entity246 , @entity4			0
he is believed to enjoy boating and may travel to locations along the @entity249 in his boat			0
he also owns property in @entity252 , @entity4			0
the software can lock the information on a computer and hold it to ransom - one @entity138 , an untraceable form of online currency favoured by criminals , which is around $ 500			2
file picture computer users who fear they could fall victim to the virus are advised to install anti-virus software and ensure their operating system has the latest security updates			1
a spokesperson for the @entity101 , which assisted the @entity15 with the operation against the @entity10 botnet , said : ' the @entity101 continues to urge individuals to ensure they have the most up to date anti-virus software to protect themselves from malicious software			1
' users are also advised to change their passwords , as original passwords may have been compromised during infection , and to enable automatic updates on their anti-virus software			1
users are also advised being cautious when handling unsolicited or unexpected emails , particularly during the two - week window before hackers rebuild their network			0
experts have also warned users to back - up all valuable data			0
many of those whose computers have already been infected will be contacted by their internet service providers			2
@entity46 has also produced a clean - up tool for infected users who need to get rid of the malware			1
however potential victims only have only a short time to protect themselves before the hackers can rebuild their network .			0

up to one million computers have been infected by ' @entity10 '
the software can lie dormant on computers before draining accounts
thousands of @entity12 computers may be infected with the malware , which is *extremely* sophisticated and can evade anti-virus software
an international police effort has halted the spread of the botnet , giving computer users two weeks to install anti-virus before the virus hits again
