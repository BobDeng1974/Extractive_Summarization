on screen , @entity0 was the @entity2			1
with his blond hair , blazing blue eyes and chiselled features , his face was more eloquent than any of the lines written for him in hit movies such as @entity10 , @entity11 , getaway and the @entity13			2
his tough , raw charisma appealed to male and female cinemagoers alike			2
he was seen as a romantic hero and an adventurer ; uncompromisingly macho , yet with — his fans liked to believe — a gentle heart			2
no wonder he became the highest - paid movie star in the world until his death in 1980 at the age of 50 , and no wonder his films live on			1
now a tv documentary sets out to explain the upbringing that made him such a complicated man			2
it is produced by his son @entity42 , who knew him better than anyone			1
if @entity0 ’s three marriages were fraught , so were his relationships with his fellow @entity48 movers and shakers			1
a loner , he was well known for his rivalry with co-stars and would deliberately set out to steal scenes from them			2
‘ he was always worried about things being taken away from him , ’ says @entity42			1
‘ but if you look at where he came from , you can understand why			2
’ the tales are legendary			2
appearing in the @entity59 in 1974 with @entity60 , he insisted on being given 12 more lines of dialogue , so he and @entity60 would be equal			2
he also insisted that the final shot in the film belonged to him and asked the wardrobe department to have the brim of his fireman ’s helmet cut back , as he did n’t want his eyes in shadow			2
they said if his was changed , they would have to change everyone ’s			2
‘ then change them , ’ he said			2
when @entity75 was being cast in the @entity76 , @entity0 was offered the @entity78 role			1
but when he found out that @entity60 — his keenest rival — had been cast as @entity79 , he insisted the title should be the @entity81 and @entity79 , so his name came before @entity60 ’s			2
his demand was turned down , and the role went to @entity85			2
@entity86 getting lifted into a @entity87 by his father who he said he idolised despite his faults @entity0 went on to demand $ 3 million for a brief cameo in @entity92 ( 1977 ) , but received a polite refusal from director @entity94			1
he lost the starring role in @entity96 because he wanted too much money , and @entity98 stepped in			2
in 1979 , he was offered @entity99 , but would accept only if the location was moved from the @entity101 to @entity48			2
yet @entity0 could sometimes turn his perfectionism into extra cash			1
making the @entity13 ( 1968 ) , for which he was being paid $ 750,000 , he tried on four expensive watches for one scene , but said they were n’t suitable			1
instead he wore his own — and charged the producer $ 250 for ‘ wristwatch rental ’			0
@entity42 has heard them all and springs to his father ’s defence			1
‘ people say how difficult he was , but that was because he was n’t a sheep , ’ he insists			0
‘ he knew what was right for him			0
he always did his homework and had a good idea about how he wanted to play a scene			0
he would fight to the death with directors to get his way , but that was how he was with everything			1
he lived on the edge			0
’ @entity42 idolised his father but saw how damaged he was			1
@entity0 was the son of an alcoholic prostitute and was abandoned by both his mother and his father			1
passed around family , then living on his wits on the streets , he seemed all set for a life of crime			0
‘ my dad had a horrible childhood , ’ says @entity42			1
‘ it made him the man he was			0
he fought like hell for what he believed in , but he had a very short temper ; i saw that at home and in his work			0
he was n’t opposed to knocking somebody out if they crossed him			0
’ at 15 , in trouble with the police for stealing and fighting , @entity0 was sent to a reform school , the @entity151			1
‘ it was one step away from jail , ’ says @entity42			1
‘ for the first time , he felt some stability			2
his father had left before he was born , his mother had shunted him around , his stepfather had beaten him and he ’d grown into his teens practically an orphan			0
when i was growing up , he never talked about his mother			0
‘ he always told me , “ son , @entity151 turned my life around ”			2
when he came out , he went into the @entity163 for three years , then drifted into acting			0
’ @entity42 adds : ‘ if any good came out of him feeling so unwanted as a kid , it was that he always made sure me and my older sister , @entity167 , knew how much he loved us			1
he wanted to make up for what he never had			0
’ @entity0 , left , bought this @entity171 while he was filming @entity11 , the car recently sold for £ 6million @entity0 insisted his family came with him on long location shoots			1
‘ if he was our comfort blanket , we were his , ’ @entity42 says			1
@entity42 and @entity167 may have been @entity0 ’s priority , but he made it clear that his marriage was to be conducted on his own terms			1
he began an affair within weeks of marrying his first wife , @entity181 , in 1956 — and , as his career took off , he had dalliances with many others			0
‘ he made no secret of what was going on , ’ @entity181 says in the documentary , ‘ and i decided i would have to live with it			0
once , he said : “ why do i have to work so hard for love at home when it ’s free everywhere else ? ” ’ ‘ we knew he loved the ladies , ’ smiles @entity42			1
‘ women would hit on him constantly , even in front of @entity181			0
he was cool about it			0
’ but there was one rule for @entity0 and another for @entity181			1
he became obsessively jealous , convinced she was having an affair , and held a gun to her head to make her confess			0
‘ he terrified me , ’ @entity181 admits			0
when she admitted she ’d had a romance with actor @entity207 , @entity0 beat her up			1
a few weeks later , she told @entity0 she was pregnant and he made her fly to @entity209 for an abortion , saying he could n’t be sure he was the father			1
the couple divorced in 1971			0
his next film was @entity213 , in which his co-star was @entity215			0
her husband , @entity216 , was the producer , but the pair had a torrid affair			0
‘ the attraction was scary , ’ @entity215 reveals in the documentary			0
they married in 1973 but heaven soon turned to hell : ‘ he was tremendously insecure and dangerous			0
’ @entity0 told her she had to give up her career to look after their home — and he expected dinner at 6pm sharp every day			1
‘ when it was good it was very , very good , but when it was bad it was horrendous , ’ she says			0
@entity0 , was diagnosed with cancer and died in november 1980 , probably from breathing asbestos she has previously told how once , on location , he went off partying with two local beauties , leaving @entity215 alone , and that night she could hear them all in the next room			1
in the morning , @entity0 asked her to cook him breakfast and said nothing about the night before			1
it was typical of his attitude — he had already banned @entity215 from wearing heels and having long nails			0
as he once said : ‘ they call me a chauvinist pig			0
i am and i do n’t give a damn			0
’ ‘ after five years @entity0 sort of checked out of the marriage , ’ @entity215 says now			1
‘ @entity42 would come downstairs and find plates sailing past his head			1
it was a rotten family scenario			0
’ @entity0 ’s stardom was consolidated with films including cult horror hit @entity255 , @entity256 and @entity10			1
yet even at the height of his fame , his insecurity surfaced			0
he always demanded bulk consignments of razors and jeans when he started on a movie — it was later discovered that he donated them to @entity151			1
he loved fast cars but was happiest on his motorbike and when there was a full moon — even in the middle of filming — he would vanish on it for a day or two			0
‘ it ’s not like he was a werewolf , but it did make him go strange			0
sometimes he would even bark and growl , ’ laughs @entity42			1
‘ he never explained where he went and we did n’t ask			0
’ after splitting with @entity215 , @entity0 grew a beard and travelled the country in a motorhome with his young model girlfriend , @entity281 , whom he later married , and @entity42			1
‘ he ’d had enough of fame , ’ says @entity42			1
‘ he wanted to stay at the beach ; he would n’t let scripts be delivered to the house , so i ’d have to pick them up at a gas station			0
’ he made only two movies in that period , and it was while filming @entity292 that he started to complain of chest pains			0
doctors diagnosed cancer , probably caused by working with asbestos when he was in the @entity163			0
he fought to the end but died on november 7 , 1980			0
the @entity0 name has lived on			1
@entity42 is an actor and also raced cars ; his own son @entity301 is an actor in @entity302			1
the legend , too , remains			2
‘ thirty - four years after he died he is still well loved and respected for his work , ’ says @entity42			1
‘ my dad was proof that whatever does n’t kill you , makes you stronger			0
