by @entity1 reporter published : 18:26 est , 13 june 2012 updated : 02:16 est , 14 june 2012 actress @entity2 decided to confront her @entity4 critic when she discovered the offending tweet a @entity6 leading lady was so enraged by the online criticism of a suburban housewife she 's embarked on a bitter @entity4 battle that 's ended up with both parties accusing the other of cyber bullying			1
actress @entity2 , who plays @entity15 in @entity16 , snapped after discovering the 48 - year - old from @entity18 had sent her friend a tweet that read : ' ah but u know i ca n’t stand @entity23 … ' miss @entity2 , 27 , and her actor boyfriend then bombarded the fan with angry public messages			1
incredibly , the tweet was not tagged or direct messaged to @entity2 ’s @entity4 account			1
so the only way the @entity30 - born performer , 27 , could have seen it was by searching out her name on @entity4 - or if the message was brought to her attention by someone who had done so			0
a day after the initial message , the housewife , who has asked to remain anonymous , but tweets under the name @entity41 , then received a tweet from @entity2 reading : ' it ’s ok cause i ca n’t stand you either ; ) x ' @entity2 ’s boyfriend , @entity49 actor @entity48 then weighed in , tweeting : ' lack of taste is ok , lack of education is just sad , something to think about cause u ’ve already got some years behind u. ' the housewife immediately apologised - but she was then accused of cyber-bullying by @entity2 , a former @entity59 pupil who has played @entity60 at @entity61 for two years			1
the actress wrote : ' i take criticism very well			2
but one thing is to criticise and one v different is to be offensive , disrespectful and mean			0
to me , " i do n’t like her portrayal " sounds v dif to " i ca n’t stand her ’ "			1
' miss @entity2 in character as @entity60 in @entity71 of the @entity72 the tweet that provoked miss @entity2 's ire miss @entity2 responded to her critic 's tweet with a direct message the actress then wrote a string of angry tweets in response the ranting continued , with a tweet which read : ' just because i ’m a performer that gives people the right to insult me without me being able to defend myself ? i do n’t think so			1
' and it went on : ' my job does n’t make me super human and respect goes down well no matter what profession people have			0
and i wo n’t be insulted and not stand up for myself			0
just because i ’m a performer it does n’t give you a free pass to bullying			0
' the housewife also received a series of insulting tweets from @entity2 ’s fans			2
today she said that the actress should have had a thicker skin : ' how can you get angry over such a stupid comment ? it ’s laughable			0
' i can understand actors hating anything negative written about them , but to take it on a personal level like this ? and against a mere punter like myself who only expressed her honest opinion as a theatre lover ? ' she has accused me of cyber-bullying but many people have now said to me that they think she is the one who is the cyber-bully			0
' a spokesman for the musical and @entity2 declined to comment .			2
