by @entity1 reporter published : 18:59 est , 6 november 2013 updated : 19:00 est , 6 november 2013 one of the @entity3 leaders who was filmed toppling 170million - year - old rock formations at a state park claims his uncle was killed by falling rocks and he knocked over the monuments because he feared they would fall and hurt someone			1
@entity12 says he and @entity13 found the formations to be dangerously unstable and dangerously near hiking trails at @entity16 in central @entity17			1
park rangers , though , are unmoved by @entity12 's story			1
they say that if the two men believed there was a danger , they should have alerted the proper authorities instead of destroying a geological wonder			0
the cameraman : @entity26 told local media he is receiving death threats since the stunt father of the year : @entity13 tipped over the rock while his son cheered him on @entity12 's aunt told the @entity34 that @entity12 was greatly effected by the sudden death of his uncle @entity36 in 1982			1
@entity37 tells the newspaper that her late husband was hiking in @entity40 with friends when a boulder suddenly came loose and tumbled onto the trail where he was hiking			0
' i â€™m probably a little bit more paranoid about what a loose rock can do , ' @entity12 said			1
rangers are still investigating the case against @entity12 and @entity13 over the october 11 incident			1
one stumbling block : putting a price tag on the rock formations that they knocked over			0
however , state officials believe that once they have determined the value of the damage , they will hand the investigation over to prosecutors to pursue charges			2
caught on camera : @entity13 is filmed pushing the ' loose ' rock in @entity16 destroyed : the massive rock , which had been in place for 20 million years , crashes to the ground beneath celebration : @entity13 and @entity67 high - five while the cameraman , @entity26 , laughs and whoops for joy last month , the @entity17 chapter of the @entity72 that sponsors @entity12 and @entity13 removed them both as leaders			1
' we encourage all leaders and scouts to review the " @entity80 " principles , as we are all a part of maintaining the integrity , character and the natural beauty of the outdoors for all living things , ' the statement said			2
the rock formation they toppled over is about 170 million years old , @entity88 spokesman @entity87 said			0
the central @entity17 park is dotted with thousands of the eerie , mushroom - shaped sandstone formations			0
the rock formations at @entity16 in @entity17 are thousands of years old , formed by the erosion of the material around the base of the rock proud : the men said they were ' saving lives ' because the loose rock could have fallen on a child @entity12 and @entity13 came under fire last month after posting a video on @entity104 where @entity13 can be seen wedging himself between a formation and a boulder to knock a large rock off the formation 's top			1
@entity13 and his two companions can then be seen cheering , high - fiving and dancing			1
they said the rock formation was loose and they feared it was dangerous			0
they were leading a group of teenage @entity72 on a trip when it happened			0
@entity12 said they found out about losing their @entity72 positions monday morning			2
they had been troop leaders for a few years , @entity12 said , and hope to continue to be involved in organization in the future using what happened as a teaching point			1
both men are from @entity129 , @entity17 , about 30 miles south of @entity130			0
' we 've always supported the @entity72 and if that 's what they feel is best , we support that decision , ' @entity12 said			2
' we 're extremely sorry for our mistake			0
we look forward to doing everything we can to make it right and move on			0
