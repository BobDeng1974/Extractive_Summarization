@entity0 ran across three battlefields amid machine gun fire to help injured soldiers lead his platoon to safety after higher officers were killed name used in @entity9 bill encouraging recognition of @entity12 soldiers by @entity13 last updated at 2:45 pm on 10th january 2012 it was bravery at the highest level : @entity0 defied @entity17 machine gun fire to sprint across a @entity19 battlefield and pull wounded comrades to safety			1
not just once , but three times			2
then , with the platoon 's senior soldiers wounded or killed , the 19 - year - old @entity23 took over command of his unit and led it to safety , even after a bullet pierced his helmet and lodged behind an ear			1
yet mr @entity0 never earned the nation 's highest military citation - the @entity33 - many suspected this was because he was @entity12 at a time when discrimination ran rampant throughout the @entity23 military			1
determined : @entity38 has lobbied for her father , @entity39 , to be posthumously awarded the @entity33 for his heroic actions during combat on the @entity43 battlefields of @entity19 now , nearly four decades after his death , mr @entity0 may finally get that medal , thanks to the tireless efforts of his daughter , whose long quest to see her father decorated also opens the door for other overlooked @entity12 veterans of the @entity19			1
' a wrong has been made right here , ' said mr @entity0 's daughter , 82 - year - old @entity38 of @entity55 , @entity56 , a small town about 40 miles southwest of @entity57			1
@entity58 : @entity0 enlisted at age 18 , three years below the required age of 21 last month , president @entity61 signed the @entity62 , which contains a tiny provision known as the @entity64			1
it provides for a @entity67 review of @entity12 soldiers and sailors who may have been overlooked for the @entity33 simply because of their faith			1
mr @entity0 's daughter was the driving force behind the measure , an effort that began a decade ago when she read news accounts of a similar law that provided for review of @entity12 possibly denied recognition in @entity79 she was horrified there was no similar mechanism for @entity19 veterans			1
so she began gathering military records , photos , commendations and firsthand accounts of her father 's heroism			0
eventually , she enlisted the help of her congressman and support from both @entity23 senators from @entity56			0
retired army colonel @entity95 of @entity96 , who is active in the @entity97 , helped get the bill passed			2
he also reviewed mr @entity0 's war record and will present the case on his behalf to the @entity67			1
' i believe , based upon the criteria of @entity19 , the level of heroism exhibited by @entity104 will rise to the @entity33 , ' mr @entity95 said			0
at the time , the enlistment age was 21 , but mr @entity0 lied about his age and got in at 18			1
a tall , strapping athlete who played semi-pro baseball at age 15 and later played college football at @entity111 , mr @entity0 was sent off to @entity43			1
on a hot day in august 1918 , he and his platoon were doing battle near a river in @entity115			2
one of his superiors , captain @entity117 , later wrote in support of a @entity33 : ' with the most utter disregard for his own safety , ( @entity119 ) sprang from his position in his platoon trench , dashed out across the open in full sight of the @entity17 , who opened and maintained a furious burst of machine gun and rifle fire			1
' mr @entity0 did n't stop there			1
casualties were heavy and many senior platoon leaders had been killed or badly hurt , so the young sergeant led the group out of harm 's way over the next three days			1
along the way , a @entity17 bullet hit him in the head , went through the steel helmet and lodged behind his left ear			0
mr @entity0 eventually collapsed and was hospitalized for three months			1
the wound left him deaf in that ear			0
his heroics did not go unnoticed : @entity145 was awarded the @entity146 , the nation 's second - highest military honor			0
different times : ms @entity38 believes that anti-emitism during @entity19 lead to his slight			2
in a recent defense bill , there is even a provision named after him encouraging @entity12 soldiers to be recognized after the fact he eventually left the military , got a degree from @entity111 and started a greenhouse - and - nursery business in the @entity162 , where he raised three children			1
mr @entity0 was satisfied with the medal he got , his daughter recalled , and only occasionally wondered if he was passed over for the @entity33 because of @entity167			1
' my father told me there was a lot of discrimination , but he did n't dwell on it , ' she said			0
but once , when another soldier paid a visit , ms @entity38 was struck by something the man told her			0
' he witnessed my father 's actions , ' she said recalling the visit 70 years later			0
' he told me , “ your father never got the medal he deserved because he was a jew			0
” i thought to myself how terrible that was			0
' mr @entity0 was 78 when he died in 1973			2
crowning achievement : a decision could come by spring			0
if the @entity67 approves , the president would present the medal on mr @entity0 's behalf to his daughter in a @entity192 ceremony			2
the new law may have arrived too late to recognize many @entity12 heroes from @entity19 they 're all gone now — the last surviving @entity23 @entity19 veteran died last year			2
even many of their children have died or are well into their 80s and 90s , mr @entity95 said , making it less likely that surviving relatives will have enough documentation to prove worthiness for the @entity33			0
so far , mr @entity95 said , the only veteran whose case will be presented for review is @entity0			2
a decision could come by spring			0
if the @entity67 approves , the president would present the medal on mr @entity0 's behalf to his daughter in a @entity192 ceremony			2
just the thought chokes her up			0
' i try so hard to think of what my father would think of this , ' she said			0
' he was such a humble man			0
all i can see in my head is this big handsome man sitting down , tears in his eyes			0
