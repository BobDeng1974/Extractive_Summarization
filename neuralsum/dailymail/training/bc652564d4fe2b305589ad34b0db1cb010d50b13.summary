@entity0 wants his @entity2 cycling team to be ‘ @entity6 ready ’ by january 1 , 2015 , which makes this weekend ’s track cycling @entity3 in @entity5 perfectly timed			1
some of the signs are worrying , however			0
if the @entity9 were to begin on january 1 , then there would arguably be only one event that @entity11 would start as clear favourites : the women ’s team pursuit			2
led by the biggest star of the current team , @entity18 , they have suffered just three defeats since the event was inaugurated at the 2008 world championships in @entity22			1
for the past four years they have established a 100 per cent record and in the @entity5 velodrome on friday evening they extended that , racing to victory over @entity28			1
@entity2 's cycling team technical director @entity0 ( left ) speaks with @entity18 ( right ) @entity30 is now the star of the @entity2 team following the retirements of sir @entity33 and @entity34 @entity30 ( centre ) won a gold medal at the @entity5 2012 games with @entity38 ( left ) and @entity39 ( right ) across the whole squad , there seems little doubt the @entity2 team are feeling the absence of sir @entity33 and @entity34 , the talismanic figures who retired in 2012 after each starring in two @entity46 and contributing to the haul of 16 gold medals			1
the difficulty for @entity50 , who replaced sir @entity51 as performance director in april , is in trying to maintain such dominance			1
‘ it ’s all about continuous improvement , ’ said @entity50 of the squad ’s philosophy , ‘ so we ’d like to think success would follow			1
‘ however , life goes in cycles , ’ he added			0
‘ you have a talent pool and sometimes that gets saturated			1
i would n’t say we have a massive amount of talent but i do think we have the tools in the toolbox to do the job in @entity6			2
’ the shallowness of the talent pool only accentuates the importance of @entity30 , the 22 - year old from @entity74 who won two gold medals at @entity76			1
she will be 24 in @entity6 , 28 in @entity78 and could go on to 2024 and beyond			0
@entity34 was 27 when she won her first @entity46 title , @entity33 28 when he claimed the first of his six gold medals , so it is far from inconceivable that @entity30 might succeed @entity33 as @entity2 ’s most decorated @entity83			1
@entity30 is fortunate to be surrounded by strong team - mates , with the emergence of @entity87 ’s @entity86 over the last 12 months bolstering the team pursuit squad			1
@entity30 ( left ) has been aided by the emergence of @entity87 's @entity86 ( right ) @entity30 could become more decorated than sir @entity33 ( left ) and @entity34 ( right ) but as @entity30 admitted on friday evening , after the latest win , the competition is getting tougher all the time			2
‘ it ’s getting harder , ’ she said			0
‘ you definitely feel the pressure now			0
’ today , @entity30 will go for a second @entity3 gold medal in the omnium , which would repeat her double success at @entity76			2
she has something beyond mere talent that allows her to connect with the crowd and gets them behind her			2
‘ i absolutely love it here , ’ said @entity30			0
‘ it ’s nice to know they are totally behind you			0
you can hear them going absolutely nuts			0
it ’s that spirit and energy that carries you around the track			0
’ if the women have @entity30 to lead the line , the men should have sir @entity118 , who has promised to return for @entity6			0
his presence will certainly lift a team pursuit squad who battled to a gold medal on friday evening after perennial rivals @entity28 punctured in their semi-final .			0

@entity18 has emerged as the leader of the @entity2 cycling team
@entity0 wants good performance at cycling @entity3 in @entity5
@entity50 admitted that the cycling talent pool is not as strong as before
