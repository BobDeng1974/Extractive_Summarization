by @entity0 published : 10:48 est , 2 november 2012 updated : 14:59 est , 2 november 2012 a historically black women ’s college in @entity3 has pulled the plug on its collegiate athletics programme in order to channel the funding towards a campus - wide health and fitness initiative			1
@entity10 is a liberal arts college that counts prolific @entity11 such as @entity13 winning author @entity12 , @entity14 ’s daughter and his fictional daughter @entity16 – actress , @entity15 – among its alumni			1
the announcement on thursday comes in recognition of the overwhelming number of cases of type 2 diabetes and obesity affecting one in two students while staggering statistics show four out of five @entity11 in @entity27 women are obese			2
changing times : @entity10 in @entity3 , @entity30 , said that it will redirect money that was dedicated to its intercollegiate sports programme - serving just 4 per cent of students - to all 2,100 on campus the school said it would use the nearly $ 1 million that had been dedicated to its intercollegiate sports program , serving just 4 percent of students , for a campus - wide health and fitness program benefiting all 2,100			1
‘ when i was looking at the decision , it was n't being driven by the cost as much as the benefit			0
with $ 1 million , 80 student - athletes are benefiting , ’ said dr. @entity40 , @entity41 's president			1
‘ or should we invest in a wellness program that would touch every student 's life ? ’ @entity41 's decision wo n't influence the @entity52 and @entity51 of the world - where sports have become inextricable from the identity of the university			1
but it could attract notice at a broader band of colleges struggling with budget cuts and agonizing over whether the cost of college athletics is compatible with their missions			0
for @entity40 , there is also an element of social responsibility			0
‘ i have been to funerals of young alums who were not taking care of themselves , and i believe we can change that pattern not only for them but for the broader community , ’ @entity40 said			0
the @entity77 school has been part of the @entity79 in seven sports , including basketball , softball and tennis			0
going for a run : the decision comes at a college with a small @entity88 programme in comparison with the likes of @entity30 and @entity91 @entity40 said the school was sending a letter to the @entity88 saying the school would be withdrawing from the conference and would no longer have an athletics program			1
instead , the school plans to expand wellness programs and renovate fitness facilities			0
@entity99 , an associate professor of sports administration at @entity101 , called the announcement eye - catching and predicted it could serve as a model at similar schools			2
' with $ 1million , 80 student - athletes are benefiting			1
or should we invest in a wellness programme that would touch every student 's life ? ' dr @entity111 president ‘ i do n't really look at this as a complete anomaly , " said @entity99 , who is also president - elect of the @entity113 , a national faculty organization advocating for changes in college athletics			1
‘ i think there might be other schools that try to get out of the rat race and get back to the original view of we need to worry about the mind and body of our students			0
’ @entity41 is unusually well - suited for such a move as it will likely face little uproar from alumni			0
@entity40 acknowledged that @entity41 's student - athletes were disappointed when they were told last spring , but said she was hopeful it would not discourage them or future students			1
‘ they are passionate about what they do and want to keep doing it , ’ @entity40 said			0
‘ students who really want to be at @entity41 will still come to @entity41			0
@entity138 has been important to those students who have participated but to the overall campus community it has not been a major emphasis			0
’ the cost of athletics can be particularly painful at @entity145 , which have struggled to maintain enrollment in recent years , due to the weak economy and tighter credit requirements that have made it harder for some of their often low - income students to get loans to pay for college			2
college choice : @entity41 's decision could attract notice at a broad band of colleges struggling with budget cuts and agonising over whether the cost of college athletics is compatible with their missions earlier this month , all - male @entity41 's sibling institution in @entity3 - announced it would furlough faculty and make other budget cuts due to lower - than - expected enrollment			1
the economics of college athletics vary widely from big - time programs to @entity77 schools where intercollegiate athletics are little more than another extracurricular activity			1
' i think there might be other schools that try to get out of the rat race and get back to the original view of we need to worry about the mind and body of our students ' @entity184 associate professor at most places , they lose money for the college and typically , schools say that 's fine			1
they argue there 's educational value in athletics , and they run all sorts of programs to benefit students that are n't expected to pay for themselves , from jazz bands to the @entity203 department			2
it 's part of the college experience			2
but athletics are a part of the experience for only the tiny percentage of students who participate directly			0
according to the @entity88 , there are about 400,000 student - athletes nationwide , but there are 18.6 million undergraduates			1
new ideas : the @entity77 school has been part of the @entity79 in seven sports the median @entity220 athletic program , including those without football , is losing about $ 10 million annually , according to @entity88 figures			2
at programs like @entity41 , the losses are less severe but expenses are rising rapidly			0
for @entity77 schools with football programs , expenses from athletics have nearly doubled since 2004 to $ 2.9 million for the median school			0
at schools without football , such as @entity41 , costs have more than doubled to about $ 1.4 million annually			0
at @entity41 , the wellness initiative includes spending money to help renovate the school 's @entity238 , which was built in the 1950s , to make it a state - of - the - art fitness facility , with expanded hours and programs			2
‘ we are trying to meet students where they are in terms of their interest , but also helping them understand that the elements of wellness ... are the kinds of things that are going to help them avoid the kinds of illnesses that are killing @entity11 - @entity11 women far too early , ’ @entity40 said			2
keeping fit : the school is informing the @entity88 that it will withdraw from the conference and no longer have an athletics programme big price : the cost of athletics can be particularly painful at historically black colleges and universities , which have struggled to maintain enrolment in recent years			1
