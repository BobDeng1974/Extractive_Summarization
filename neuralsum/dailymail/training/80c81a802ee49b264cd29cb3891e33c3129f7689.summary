by @entity0 for @entity1 drinking more than three cups of coffee a day can double a person 's risk of developing diabetes , @entity3 scientists have warned drinking more than three cups of coffee a day can double a person 's risk of developing diabetes , researchers have today warned			1
regularly drinking coffee can increase the risk of prediabetes - the early stage of type two diabetes - in those adults who metabolise caffeine slowly and suffer hypertension , scientists have found			1
the @entity3 team studied 1,180 patients aged between 18 and 45 , who suffered stage one hypertension - high blood pressure - but not diabetes			1
they found of the coffee drinkers , 87 per cent drank one to three cups a day , while 13 per cent drank more			0
the study found 42 per cent of participants were fast metabolisers of caffeine and 58 per cent were slow			2
over the course of six years , scientists diagnosed prediabetes in 24 per cent of patients			0
@entity39 coffee drinkers were found to have a 34 per cent increased risk of developing prediabetes and heavy caffeine addicts faced a 50 per cent heightened risk			1
yet the risk of prediabetes linked with coffee intake was increased only in slow caffeine metabolisers			2
dr @entity47 , from @entity48 in @entity49 , north east @entity3 said : ' lifestyle factors are very important for the prognosis of young people with hypertension			1
' in a previous analysis of @entity56 ) we found that coffee was a risk factor for the development of sustained hypertension and that the risk was modulated by the genetic background of the individual			0
' @entity64 of caffeine were at increased risk of hypertension			1
' our study shows that drinking coffee increases the risk of prediabetes in young adults with hypertension who are slow caffeine metabolisers			1
' the risk is even greater if these individuals are overweight or obese , and if they are heavy drinkers of coffee			2
' slow caffeine metabolisers are exposed for a longer time to the detrimental effects of caffeine on glucose metabolism			0
' thus , the effect of coffee on prediabetes depends on two factors , the amount of daily coffee intake and the individual 's genetic background			0
a study of nearly 2,000 patients found heavy caffeine addicts who metabolise coffee slowly and have high blood pressure are at highest risk of developing prediabetes - the early stage of type two diabetes ' @entity98 - to - middle - age people with hypertension should be aware that coffee consumption may increase their risk of developing diabetes in later life			1
' genotyping for the @entity104 gene polymorphism could help them to better know their risk			0
' the results of the @entity56 study suggest that in patients with hypertension , caffeinated coffee should be considered a dietary risk factor for prediabetes			0
' this risk applies especially to slow caffeine metabolisers and to patients who are overweight or obese			2
' our findings contradict previous epidemiologic studies that have advocated coffee consumption as a means to lower the risk of type two diabetes mellitus			0

@entity3 scientists found heavy caffeine addicts had a 50 *%* increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes
but study *highlighted* risk was only *pertinent* for those young adults who metabolise caffeine slowly and suffer high blood pressure
dr @entity47 said risk is even greater in those who are obese or overweight
