unveiled : the @entity0 is set to reveal his identity in a televised interview next week - drawing the wrath of his superiors the commander of the @entity0 has lashed out at the ' selfish ' serviceman planning to give a tell - all interview on national television describing how he killed @entity11			1
rear admiral @entity12 said that seeking ' public notoriety and financial gain ' from sharing secret operations is a betrayal of @entity0 values , and warns that the military will take legal action against anybody who breaks the law by leaking information			1
it comes ahead of an interview to be broadcast by @entity25 , in which the as - yet unnamed @entity0 will reveal his identity			1
the program , due to air november 11 and 12 , also promises an ' extensive , firsthand account ' of @entity31 , the raid on @entity11 's compound in @entity33 , @entity34 , which killed the terrorist leader			1
rear admiral @entity12 made the attack in an open letter , co-signed by the force master chief @entity39			1
the letter was reporting by special forces news site @entity40 , which also named the seal			1
it is unclear whether the name is correct			2
although the message was not aimed at an individual , and was addressed simply to ' teammates ' , it was a clear warning to the solider - also referred to as @entity51			1
in the letter , @entity12 emphasizes that military operations - like @entity31 - are accomplished thanks to thousands of servicemen , and that ' little credit ' is due to any individual			1
elsewhere , doubt has been cast on whether anyone can claim to have personally killed @entity11 , because the operation was so dark and chaotic that no seal would have been able to tell whether his shot had connected rather than anyone else 's			1
the identity of the seal that shot him has been a fiercely guarded since operation : this is the plan for @entity71 , in which @entity11 's compound was raided and the terrorist was killed remote : pictured above is @entity11 's compound in @entity33 , @entity34			1
it has since been demolished @entity12 wrote : ' a critical tenant of our @entity77 is " i do not advertise the nature of my work , nor seek recognition for my actions			1
" our @entity77 is a life - long commitment and obligation , both in and out of the service			1
' violators of our @entity77 are neither @entity87 in good standing , not teammates who represent @entity90			2
relic : the above shirt was worn by @entity51 during the raid , and now belongs to the 9/11 museum ' we do not abide willful or selfish disregard for our core values in return for public notoriety and financial gain , which only diminishes otherwise honorable service , courage and sacrifice			1
' our credibility as a premier fighting force is forged in this sacrifice and has been accomplished with honor , as well as humility			2
' he finished by urging seals to ' continue to serve with honor on and off the battlefield ' - a clear barb for the shooter ahead of his plans to speak			1
the letter follows a similar warning from the @entity118 last week , when a spokesman warned that everyone involved in the raid is bound by a non-disclosure agreement			1
she told @entity124 : ' if in fact this individual was associated with the military unit that carried out the @entity11 [ @entity11 ] raid , which is yet to be determined , he is still bound by his non-disclosure agreement to not discuss classified information , especially in a nationally televised interview			1
' the shooter has already spoken out - anonymously - about his apparent role in the operation , in an extensive account of the night for @entity138			1
in the interview he described the fatal moment , saying : '' i 'm just looking at him from right here [ he moves his hand out from his face about ten inches ]			2
he 's got a gun on a shelf right there , the short @entity149 he 's famous for			2
' and he 's moving forward			0
i do n't know if she 's got a vest and she 's being pushed to martyr them both			0
he 's got a gun within reach			0
i need to get a head shot so he wo n't have a chance to clack himself off [ blow himself up ]			0
' in that second , i shot him , two times in the forehead			0
bap ! bap ! the second time as he 's going down			0
he crumpled onto the floor in front of his bed and i hit him again , bap ! same place			2
bated breath : president @entity170 , @entity171 and @entity172 , among others , are pictured above watching @entity71 from @entity174 as it unfolded ' that time i used my @entity176 red - dot holo sight			2
i watched him take his last breaths , just a reflex breath			0
' and i remember as i watched him breathe out the last part of air , i thought : is this the best thing i 've ever done , or the worst thing i 've ever done ? this is real and that 's him			0
' the shooter is the second seal to divulge details of the night , following @entity193 , the author of the 2012 book @entity194 , controversially published without approval from the @entity118			1
