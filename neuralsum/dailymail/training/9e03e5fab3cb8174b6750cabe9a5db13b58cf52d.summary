@entity6 and @entity7 , aka @entity8 and @entity9 , had been working a children 's event nearby when they saw smoke engulfing the @entity14 home			1
the dynamic duo rushed to see if anyone was inside the home and that 's when they foudn the lucky kitty			2
he and @entity9 had been at a nearby @entity45 and when they saw the fire , they knew it was time to turn their teachings into action			1
' i grabbed his shoulders , gave it everything we got and the door opened , ' @entity8 told @entity5 @entity59 affiliate @entity58			1
@entity8 is a former firefighter and @entity61 veteran and said his training kicked in and they immediately smashed out a window			2
trapped : as flames ripped through the @entity14 , @entity5 home , @entity67 and @entity9 broke inside to search for possible victims and found an especially furry one ' i 'm glad no one was inside ' : @entity8 is a former firefighter and said his training immediately kicked in			1
he grabbed the cat and pulled it outside to safety ' the smokes lets out and as i can start to see i reach down and grab something furry ! ' it was the cat , of course , but it was unresponsive			0
@entity8 took it outside and began rescue efforts			2
' the cat comes around , ' @entity8 said			2
' takes a look at me , then hissed ! ' rescued ! the cat was poorly responsive when they emerged from the fire , but @entity6 worked his magic and managed to coax the kitty back to life @entity8 said the cat hissed when it came to , but that 's understandable			1
' he got rescucitated by @entity6 , ' he said			0
' that 's a pretty scary thing to wake up to			0
' @entity8 joked that the response was warranted			0
' he got rescucitated by batman , that 's a pretty scary thing to wake up to			0
' the occupants of the home were out of town and only the cat was home at the time of the fire , a fact that made @entity8 grateful			1
but he was also left with questions , which comes as no surprise when the man in question counts @entity23 among his greatest frenemies			0
' i just want to know what 's going through that cat 's mind , ' he said			0
' i 'm just glad that nobody else was in that house			0
