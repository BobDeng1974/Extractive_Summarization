crowds may have flocked to the @entity1 to see president @entity2 make history in 2009 , but the team behind the president 's 2013 inauguration bash later this month are bracing themselves for a ton of empty seats			1
the ceremony that @entity10 will stage in a few weeks wo n't be the historic affair it was in 2009 , when nearly 2 million people flocked to the @entity13 o watch @entity2 take the oath of office			1
this time , @entity10 officials expect between 600,000 and 800,000 people for @entity2 's public swearing - in on the steps of the @entity13 on monday , january 21			1
staging area : @entity10 officials are expecting between 600,000 and 800,000 people for @entity2 's public swearing - in on the steps of the @entity13 on monday , january 21 two weeks before the big day , plenty of hotel rooms still have n't been booked			1
four years ago , some hotels sold out months in advance			2
there will be just two official inaugural balls this year , both at the @entity28 , rather than 10 official balls at multiple locations around town			2
the pair of celebrations are the lowest number since 1953 , according to the @entity35			2
a political insider told the paper : ' some on the presidential inaugural committee are starting to seriously worry			2
' his inaugural committee has also scaled the celebration back to three days of festivities , instead of four			2
some changes are on account of the slowly recovering economy and a desire by planners to ease the security burden on law enforcement			2
swearing in : the first lady @entity2 holds the @entity52 as president @entity2 takes the oath of office in 2009 , this time he will use two bibles turnout : the 2013 inauguration is n't expected to draw the same crowd that flocked to the event in 2009 , pictured but they also reflect a realization that the thrill for @entity2 's second inauguration burns a little weaker			1
' there certainly will not be the sort of exultation you saw four years ago , ' said @entity69 , a @entity70 political science professor			2
one reason why , @entity69 said , is it simply lacks the dramatic transfer of power from one president to the next			2
sealed with a kiss : @entity2 is seen holding the @entity52 , first used at the 16th president 's inauguration in 1861 ' this is not a change that commands people 's interest automatically , ' @entity69 said			1
' it 's a confirmation of power			2
' even @entity2 acknowledges he 's already , shall we say , a little washed - up the second time around			0
' i think that a lot of folks feel that , " well , he 's now president			0
he 's a little grayer			0
he 's a little older			0
it 's not quite as new as it was , " ' the president often told supporters while campaigning for re-election			0
there will be a parade , but it 's expected to be smaller too ; about 130 groups and 15,000 people marched down @entity101 to the @entity102 in 2009			1
@entity2 will be sworn in first on january 20 , the date set by the @entity104 , but it will be done in private since the day falls on a sunday			1
his public swearing - in the next day also falls on the federal holiday honoring civil rights leader @entity109 , branding the occasion with another layer of historical significance , especially for african - americans			0
lessened interest in the second inauguration of a two - term president such as @entity2 could be a natural function of @entity119 's political process , said @entity120 , associate professor of political science at the @entity122			1
' when it 's your first [ inauguration ] , you 're new and people are only seeing the potential in you , ' @entity120 said			1
' by the time the second one rolls around they 're used to your voice , they 're used to you saying certain kinds of things			0
' one group for whom the @entity2 thrill remains strong is african - americans , who overwhelmingly wanted him to have four more years in the @entity102			0
more than nine in 10 blacks voted to re-elect @entity2 , according to surveys of voters as they left their polling places in november			0
victory : @entity2 , pictured with the first family on election night , will be inaugurated for his second term privately on january 20 , with a public ceremony to follow the next day @entity148 , director of the @entity150 's @entity10 office , said he has fielded hundreds of telephone calls and emails since the november 6 election from chapter officials in @entity156 , @entity157 , @entity158 , @entity159 , @entity160 and @entity161 , all wanting tickets for their members			1
chapters from @entity165 , @entity166 , and @entity167 , @entity168 , among others , are bringing groups to @entity10 for the festivities , he said			0
' there 's still a great deal of excitement within the @entity177 - @entity119 community about the second term of the first @entity177 - @entity119 president of the @entity119 , ' @entity172 said			0
@entity180 , owner of an @entity182 - based event planning business , brought four busloads of people to @entity10 for the 2009 inauguration			1
she 's coming again , though with two fewer buses , which she blamed on the high price for accommodations and not any lack of excitement for @entity2			0
superfan : @entity180 , who will be attending president @entity193 's inauguration for the second time , looks over some of the memorabilia in her home in @entity198 , @entity199 selling : a vendor hawks @entity2 merchandise in @entity10 , ahead of his inauguration later this month @entity180 said she feels ' the same level of joy , happiness , excitement and celebration ' for @entity2 's second swearing - in among the people she comes into contact with			1
' because now he can really go to work , ' she said , explaining her view that another term should free him to govern without fear of any political repercussions			0
some of those who wanted a seat on one of @entity180 's buses were n't as sure @entity2 would win in november as they were that he would win in 2008			0
as a result , they held off on booking hotel rooms			1
then came @entity228 , preparing for @entity229 and concerns about whether @entity2 and congressional @entity231 would strike a deal to stop mandatory tax increases and spending cuts known as the ' fiscal cliff ' from taking effect with the new year			0
fitful negotiations went down to the wire , with @entity239 sending @entity2 a bill late on @entity241			0
when people did get around to pricing hotel rooms ' they just could n't afford them , ' @entity180 said			1
many hotels are charging hundreds of dollars a night for a room and requiring guests to stay at least three nights or four nights			0
cost has been ' the major conversation for lots and lots and lots of people , ' @entity180 said .			1

hotel rooms remain *unbooked* ahead of january 21 inauguration ceremony
*organizers* expecting much lower turnout than 2009 ceremony , when nearly 2 million people flocked to the @entity1
