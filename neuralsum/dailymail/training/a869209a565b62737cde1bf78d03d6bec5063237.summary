in the age of the internet hoax , viral video can be as slippery as an eel			1
take @entity4 and @entity5 , who made a pair of popular prank videos this month purporting to show a monster eel in @entity9 , on the @entity10 of @entity11			1
using special effects they learned from working in cinematography , the 20 - second clips have duped hundreds of thousands of viewers , garnered them an offer from their local council and even led to a proposal from an @entity22 television show			1
the first od the two popular 20 - second - clips , ' @entity23 yells at pizza bread in @entity27 '			1
the videoshave garnered hundreds of thousands of views as well as an offer from an @entity22 television show ( l ) the second clip , human sized eel in the @entity27			1
@entity35 says viewers have contacted them saying they too have spotted the monster eels ‘ a viral video show called @entity40 told us they wanted to use the video , ’ said @entity35			1
‘ we said " sure , be our guests "			2
we never pretended it was real , we just went along with it ! i ’m not sure if it ’s actually going on the show now , but we never lied about the nature of the clip			2
’ eventually , the brothers let the cat out of the bag			2
‘ it started to become a moralistic issue , ’ said @entity35			1
‘ the river we filmed in is very polluted			2
we were being approached by activists , as well as @entity59 , who were excited to start pouring money into the issue			0
we decided we had to throw in the towel			0
’ ‘ @entity63 , where we filmed the video , is kind of a medieval town			0
we realised that if we kept this up , we would probably be burned at the stake			0
’ the brothers own a special effects company called @entity71 , where they are commissioned to make promotional videos			1
it was here they learned the expertise to make the video convincing			1
the brothers eventually decided to expose the videos when they were contacted by their local council , who thought they represented an environmental concern @entity5 ( left ) and @entity35 own a cinematography company which gave them the expertise to create the videos			1
@entity4 ( right ) says this was their first independent project ‘ it was a pretty simple process			0
we caught some eels from the river , took them into a bathtub and filmed them over a red screen			0
we fed them luncheon meat , they blew the scale of the images up so it looks like pizza bread			0
then we imposed it over some footage of @entity100 river			0
’ mr @entity5 recalls the best reactions to the videos			1
‘ there were plenty of people who were saying , " we ’ve seen these before also "			0
i think the quality of a @entity110 video is not necessarily the number of views it gets , but the quality of the dialogue it creates			2
’ but he says he is unsure if there 's a magic ingredient for a viral video			0
‘ i do n’t know you can manufacture a big hit on the internet			0
ultimately i think you just need to release lots of quality videos and hope for the best			2
it ’s just like entering the lotto : you got ta be in it to win it ! ’			0
