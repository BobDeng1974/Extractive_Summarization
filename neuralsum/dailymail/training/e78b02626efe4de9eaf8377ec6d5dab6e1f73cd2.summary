with a new generation of fans enjoying @entity27 ’s movie , @entity3 : the @entity28 , enthusiasm for collecting all 24 of @entity30 ’s original comic books has never been higher			1
unfortunately , @entity18 was written in 1930 and depicts @entity32 natives as ignorant , simple and backward people , who are far less intelligent than their white visitors			1
leading booksellers such as @entity36 have taken the book out of the children ’s section , fearing it ‘ could get into the wrong hands ’			1
but critics claim that selling the book like a soft porn magazine is politically correct censorship , especially when children are regularly allowed to see graphic violence and sexually explicit material in the media			2
