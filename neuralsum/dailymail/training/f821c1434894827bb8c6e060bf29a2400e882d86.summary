by @entity0 legal highs have seen an ' unprecedented expansion ' in @entity3 in recent years - with one in ten people in @entity3 now admitting they have tried the drugs			1
new types of the dangerous drugs are being detected at the rate of two a week , a report has found			1
and the unprecedented rise in the number of potentially toxic new chemicals has left police and drug agencies in the @entity3 struggling to keep up			1

the @entity3 is the only country to control mephedrone ( pictured ) , a former designer drug known as ' meow meow ' the new study by the @entity20 also shows that the @entity3 is one of the worst - affected countries in @entity23			1
figures show that 8.2 per cent of @entity3 questioned in 2011 had taken so - called designer drugs			1
only @entity26 ( 16.3 per cent ) , @entity27 ( 9 per cent ) and @entity28 ( 8.8 per cent ) were worse			2
and experts warn the problem is likely to have grown because of the rising range of chemical compounds sold			2
the @entity20 's @entity34 report said 348 legal highs have been identified across the globe , with 97 new substances detected last year alone - up from 8 new ones a year earlier			2
legal highs are designed to imitate the effects of @entity42 drugs such as cocaine and ecstasy while having enough differences in their chemical make - up to get around existing bans			2
many new drugs are created in back - street laboratories in the @entity50 and are marketed as plant food or bath salts many new drugs are created in back - street laboratories in the @entity50 and are marketed as plant food or bath salts to try to skirt the law			2
police can not stop their sale in shops or at festivals because they are not prohibited			1
users of so - called designer drugs were warned that they are playing ' @entity61 ' with their lives after a huge surge in the number of deaths			1
the @entity66 ( @entity66 ) , which compiled the report , warned the ' health threat ' to those snorting , swallowing or smoking the narcotics - wrongly assumed to be safe because they are not outlawed - was ' growing rapidly '			2
doctors and nurses in @entity3 have been left ' powerless ' to treat casualties when they fall ill because they are unable to identify what substances they have taken so can not provide appropriate medical care			1
a separate study in february found 97 people were found dead with the substances in their system in 2012 , up from 12 in 2009 , meaning the toll has risen eight-fold in three years			0
@entity81 , the @entity66 's synthetic drugs researcher , said : ' the danger is people are consuming new psychoactive substances without knowing that they 're doing so			0
' so once these people have severe health issues and they wish to receive treatment they do n't actually know what they 've taken			1
it gives treatment centres huge difficulties			0
' the report added : ' emergency services may therefore find themselves unable to identify life - threatening substances and powerless to administer the proper treatment to users			1
' the 76 - page study warned that designer drugs are increasingly popular among young people and are no long restricted to ' niche ' markets			0
@entity103 , the organisation 's head of analysis , said : ' twenty years ago , you would have the heroin user , the cocaine user , but more and more people are using a variety of illegal and non-illegal drugs			0
' ministers have pledged to update drugs laws to stop unscrupulous chemists dodging bans			0
the @entity3 is the only country to control mephedrone , a former designer drug known as ' meow meow ' which was classified as a class b substance in 2010 after being linked to a spate of deaths			0
the @entity66 ( @entity66 ) , which compiled the report , warned the ' health threat ' to those snorting , swallowing or smoking the narcotics - wrongly assumed to be safe because they are not outlawed - was ' growing rapidly ' the government has introduced a temporary banning system to try to keep pace with the influx of new drugs			1
it allows a 12 - month ban on a substance while experts examine its harm and consider whether it should be outlawed permanently			0
but ms me said governments - including @entity3 - were failing to keep up with the proliferation of legal highs and urged a widening of existing bans			0
she said : ' there is evidence that when these substances are controlled there is an impact on the number of deaths			0
' the @entity66 said data for the @entity3 suggested controls may have led to a decline in mephedrone use			0
a survey indicated that annual use of the drug had dropped from 51 per cent in 2010 to 19.5 per cent in 2011 after it became illegal			0
however , another study conducted at two dance clubs in @entity160 found 52 per cent of people had uses mephedrone in the year - second only after cocaine at 59 per cent - indicating it was still popular			0
crime prevention minister @entity165 said : ' the coalition government is determined to clamp down on the reckless trade in what are somewhat inaccurately called " legal highs " , which has tragically claimed the lives of far too many young people in our country			1
' hundreds of substances previously sold are now controlled drugs in the @entity3 , mainly thanks to our use of generic legislation			0

police are struggling to keep pace with the potentially toxic new chemicals
doctors struggle to help *victims* as they do n't know what they 've taken
