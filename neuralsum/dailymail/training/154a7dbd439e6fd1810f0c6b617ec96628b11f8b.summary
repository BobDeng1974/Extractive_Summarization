last night the magazine remained defiant about running a six - page special about the couple ’s break to @entity19			1
defiant : @entity39 also published pictures of @entity6 holding hands with a mystery man on the beach ‘ referring to the photographs as ‘ unexceptional ’ and ‘ not scandalous ’ , @entity39 ’s editor @entity129 said : ‘ you can not talk of a violation of privacy when we are publishing pictures taken in a public place in the open air such as a beach , where there are other swimmers			1
‘ in any case the @entity2 press does n’t have a gentleman ’s agreement with the [ @entity145 ] royal family			0
‘ it ’s about a serene moment between a loving couple , smiling			0
where is the scandal ? ’ ironically , the article says the royal couple ‘ hope ’ that their villa ‘ is big enough to accommodate their bodyguards , who are there to protect them from chance incidents like the pictures of @entity160 that appeared last summer ’			0
@entity39 was among the publications that published topless photographs of the @entity41 , taken while she was staying at a private villa in @entity167 last summer			1

‘ they are not nude photos taken with a telescopic lens from inside a private villa			2
‘ these are images showing her on a happy holiday , and she looks amazing			0
’ despite her protests , it is possible that a photographer posed as a member of the public in order to gain access to the couple			0
either way , it is an embarrassment for the island , which prides itself on providing on and off - shore security for guests staying at its 74 exclusive villas			2
mrs @entity189 said : ‘ i think the @entity145 are very sensitive about this			0
‘ as @entity38 , we see this every day			0
we see pregnant women in bikinis on the beach – and a public one at that – so we are a lot less sensitive here in @entity38			0
