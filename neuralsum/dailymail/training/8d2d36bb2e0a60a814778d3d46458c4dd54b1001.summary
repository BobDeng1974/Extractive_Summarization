by @entity0 you 'd imagine playing a notorious @entity3 baddie - and taking all the flak that comes with it - might put you off soap for life			1
but seven years after his character , domestic abuser @entity10 , was bumped off , @entity8 is back in soapland			1
@entity8 's joined @entity13 as respectable farmer @entity14 and he 's thrilled			1
' when i started acting i played lots of upstanding , decent types - doctors , lawyers , soldiers - so it 's great to be back in that territory			1
i like @entity14 because he has a strong moral compass , but his principles might slip - so he can get jealous or seek revenge			2
' @entity8 is enjoying his character 's dramatic return to soapland @entity8 , 47 , knows all about exploring the dark side of characters after three years playing @entity10 - a serial cheat who kept girlfriend @entity33 a virtual prisoner			1
he finally met his match in @entity36 , who bashed his head in with a statue in 2007			2
an ambassador for domestic violence charity women 's aid - which he consulted over the role - @entity42 says , ' i loved playing @entity10 because i got to be very rude and badly behaved			1
from an acting point of view @entity10 was magnificent			2
every week i 'd get a script , shake my head and think , " he ca n't do that ! " ' there 've been shocks for his @entity13 character too			0
@entity14 , who had a one - night stand with his late brother @entity52 's wife @entity53 two decades ago , has discovered he 's the father of her son @entity54			1
@entity8 says , ' it 's a nasty secret that 's been bubbling away , and it 'll soon explode into the open with devastating consequences for everyone			1
' @entity42 with co-star @entity58 who plays @entity53 - his late brother 's widow so how 's @entity8 finding it back in the soap spotlight ? ' the reaction i get now from fans compared to when i played @entity10 is very different , ' he says			1
' some people were horrified at what @entity10 got up to , while others enjoyed the fact he went beyond what most normal , decent people would do			0
they congratulated me for making him so good to watch ! ' @entity14 is more subdued , so now people say hello and chat about the show			0
i 'm always touched when people come and talk to me , because it means your work 's being watched and enjoyed			2
' @entity8 commutes to the @entity13 set near @entity77 from @entity78 , where he lives with his partner and two young children			1
' i 'm shy and like to keep myself to myself , so when i 'm not acting i 'm miles away from that world			0
' @entity8 , who once described himself as a ' jobbing actor ' , having come into the industry late following a successful career in advertising , is just happy to be in work			1
' making a living through acting is tough , and getting tougher , ' he says , ' so i 'm delighted whenever i get a new job because it means i 'm working			0
as long as that continues i 'll be happy			0
' holidays , active or lazy ? they 're always active - and cold			0
i 've done plenty of trekking in @entity96			0
there is n't a lot of lying around on beaches for me these days ! cinema or restaurant ? i have n't watched a movie for ages			0
as my partner and i have kids , on a night out we 'll have some food and chat			0
music , jazz or classical ? i play clarinet in a jazz band and have done for 25 years , so i listen to a lot of jazz			2
and ' dad rock ' , i guess you 'd call it ! box sets , @entity118 ? i love mad men ; as a former advertising executive , i find it so accurate			2
the people who made it really did their research			0
tv , sport or drama ? i watch a lot of sport : football , rugby and cricket .			0
