demonstrators in @entity1 who have been protesting the grand jury decision in @entity3 this week are plotting a revolt against the @entity5 to ' make people stop and listen ' and ' make history '			1
the hashtag # @entity9 set social media on fire on wednesday night , after thousands took over the streets of @entity14 and @entity15 on tuesday after police officer @entity16 escaped charges over the shooting death of @entity19			1
the @entity20 is reporting that those protests - in which 10 of an estimated 3,000 were arrested - have inspired a bigger plan to use the spotlight surrounding the parade to push what they say is injustice			1
a notice posted to @entity29 read : ' we do not accept state violence or genocide as cause for celebration			2
when the masses gather for the @entity5 , we will gather to remind the public that black lives matter			2
' we will meet on the steps of the @entity41 bright and early to plan exact flash mob location and make our signs			1
please bring cardboard / posterboard small enough to hide on your person and markers			2
' it ’s a free pass to act like a fool			0
' however a central part of the parade each year is a significant police presence			1
while tuesday night 's protests were spontaneous , catching police off guard , the same can not be said for the parade , which brings the city to a halt			1
' they ’re not going to be able to do at the parade what they did at the @entity92 , ' the source added to the post			1
' what are they going to do , trample kids to stop a float ? ' the @entity29 post that was circulating wednesday maintained that demonstrators do not want to disrupt the parade			1
' we are not interrupting the march , we are making a statement in the crowds , ' the post said			0
' however , this is a @entity106 event			0
' @entity108 acts as parade security , so be aware , and understand we are not posting all details to the web			1
' will the weather get better ? @entity1 experienced rain and snow wednesday - just one day before the @entity115 getting ready : a worker is seen inflating a @entity118 balloon on wednesday secret magic : @entity120 is the stuff that makes @entity122 , @entity123 , @entity118 and other huge balloons sail high above the crowd at the @entity54 in @entity1 a protest is not the only obstacle the parade - now in its 88th year - is going to have to overcome in order to run smoothly today			1
@entity1 experienced both rain and snow wednesday , leaving the city wet and cold for the thousands of spectators set to turn out to watch			1
fortunately thursday is expected to see dry weather with some clouds , the @entity134 reported			0
the likes of @entity118 , @entity123 and @entity138 were photographed being inflated by workers on wednesday			1
both onlookers and workers were snapped bundled up near the balloons as rain poured down			1
almost showtime : a @entity138 balloon is seen in @entity14 on wednesday			1
the amount of helium needed for the parade balloons has to be enough to fill 600,000 to 700,000 @entity150 party balloons inclement weather : both onlookers and workers were snapped bundled up near the balloons on wednesday , with rain pouring down on the scene : balloon crewman @entity157 gets out wednesday from under some of the balloons that are part of the 15,000 @entity54 's balloons for the parade and will transport them to @entity1 helping hand : workers helped out with the balloons despite the bad weather it 'll never rank up there with turkey and pumpkin pie , but for millions of @entity172 the @entity5 experience just would n't be the same without			1
for 364 days of the year , the colorless and odorless gas works quietly behind the scenes , doing jobs like chilling magnets in @entity179 imaging machines and helping welders protect their work from impurities			0
but on @entity5 , the lighter - than - air element moves onto a much bigger stage			0
it 's the stuff that makes @entity122 , @entity123 , @entity118 and other huge balloons sail high above the crowd at the @entity54 in @entity1			0
just so we can be properly thankful for the second most abundant element in the universe ( it ranks behind hydrogen ) , @entity188 turned for some basic facts to @entity195			0
he is product manager for helium at @entity198 this week , for the 20th straight year , his company will supply the gas to the parade , which in turn is marking its 88th year			1
helium forms underground and tends to mingle with natural gas deposits			0
so when companies extract and process the natural gas , they separate out the helium and sell it to companies like @entity198			0
@entity120 is shipped worldwide , so the stuff that will pump up @entity211 or @entity212 could come from as close as @entity213 or @entity214 , or as far away as @entity215 , @entity216 or even @entity217			0
the gas is first chilled for it gets to the parade , so it can be made into a liquid and it 's easier to transport			1
huge , specialized containers of the stuff are shipped to a plant in @entity223 , @entity224			0
gas floats above the liquid in these containers ; this gas is drawn off and compressed			0
the gas is loaded into heavy steel tubes , and 10 to 12 tubes are put on each of four flatbed trucks			0
the day before the parade , the trucks drive into @entity14 for the inflating of the parade balloons			1
crews fill the balloons with long hoses , topping them off on parade day			2
the amount of helium needed for the parade has to be enough to fill 600,000 to 700,000 @entity150 party balloons			2
but the parade helium is 99.999 percent pure , whereas the stuff in a party balloon might be only 97.5 percent pure			2
heroic effort : @entity123 was seen getting prepared for the parade with puddles on the street next to him blasting through : a balloon depicting @entity254 was also being prepared , as workers donned yellow rain gear the balloons , meanwhile , come in a variety of sizes			1
according to @entity54 's , @entity122 is as tall as a three - story building , as long as 11 bicycles and as wide as five taxi cabs			0
the big balloons are made up of multiple chambers that are inflated individually			0
after the parade , the helium escapes to the atmosphere as the balloons are deflated			2
in 2008 , @entity198 tried recycling some of the gas by withdrawing it through tubes put into some of the balloons			0
but @entity195 said the process was expensive , and there was n't enough time to recover most of the gas before the streets had to be cleared for traffic			0
multiple celebrities are set to appear at the parade , a handful of which include @entity284 , @entity285 , @entity286 , @entity287 , @entity288 , @entity289 , @entity290 , @entity291 , and @entity292 , and even the @entity293 according to @entity294			2
musical numbers from several @entity297 productions , including ' @entity298 ' and ' @entity299 ' are also expected			0
global effort : @entity120 is shipped worldwide , so the stuff that will pump up @entity211 or @entity212 could come from as close as @entity213 or @entity214 , or as far away as @entity215 , @entity216 or even @entity217 essential : it 'll never rank up there with turkey and pumpkin pie , but for millions of @entity172 the @entity5 experience just would n't be the same without			0
. helium for the parade balloons			2

flash mob planning to hit the parade to promote the rallying cry ' @entity314 '
the hashtag was used around the country this week following the grand jury decision not to indict @entity16
another hashtag , # @entity9 , was being circulated on @entity60 wednesday night
calling upon people to disrupt the path of the parade by joining together
law enforcement sources told @entity75 a lack of arrests during other protests this week inspired the movement
rain and snow has already *threatened* the parade
