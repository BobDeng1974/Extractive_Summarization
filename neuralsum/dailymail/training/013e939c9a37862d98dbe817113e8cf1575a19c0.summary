a new database that was built to map the inter-migration of @entity2 has shown how the @entity3 , above all over areas , has lost the greatest amount of people since the 1950s			1
with an average of 10 million @entity2 moving to a different county each year , researchers at the @entity8 , @entity9 and the @entity10 have used @entity14 statistics over the decades to track net changes in population from each county across the country			1
the results graph much of what history has already told us , such as the @entity22 of blacks from the south and the white flight to northern suburbs			1
however the most significant consistency is the exodus of people from the @entity3 and the @entity30 , largely due to the hollowing out of the @entity33 cities , the rise of the @entity35 and brain drain			1
@entity37 represents a move of at least five people , while purple shows a net increase of 20 people per 100 individuals			0
today : this map , graphing the increase and decrease in migration to different areas , encompasses the 2000 decade			0
@entity37 represents a loss of five people or more , while purple measures 20 net migrants per 100 individuals			0
as you can see the @entity3 and the @entity30 have experienced the greatest loss back in the 1950s , migration growth was centered around @entity56 , @entity57 and @entity58			1
it also shows the intensity of the @entity3 area that would become known as the @entity33 , which was booming with industry at the time the @entity33 refers to the region that was once the hub of @entity2 's industrial sector but faced a steep decline after much of the manufacturing was transferred to the @entity68 , an increase in automation and the decline of the @entity2 steel and coal industries			1
it encapsulates the areas around @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 and the @entity80 of @entity9 , ending in northern @entity81 and eastern @entity82			0
as the maps show , the @entity3 enjoyed a boom in the 1950s and 1960s thanks to industrialization , becoming a migration mecca			2
however as the 1970s map shows , there was a mass exodus from major @entity3 cities like @entity92 , @entity93 and @entity94 , as people moved to set up in the less - established surrounding counties and cities			2
@entity98 ( @entity93 ) lost 26.6 percent of its white population in the 1970s			0
@entity100 ( @entity92 ) lost 15.5 percent , and @entity101 ( @entity94 ) 20.1 percent , according to @entity102			0
1960s : the @entity3 begins to lose people to the @entity104 , specifically @entity105 and its northern states 1970s : @entity2 booms			1
almost all areas outside of the @entity30 and the @entity3 experience major increases in migration 1980 's : : following the boom of the 1970 's , the decade after was steeped in recession , with most the country suffering a loss			2
@entity115 became the fastest growing @entity2 state , reaching a population of 1.2 million by 1990 1990 's : following the recession of the 1980 's , @entity2 is revitalized , with even the @entity3 enjoying a spike in migration despite a spike in the 1990s , mostly around @entity92 , that decline has been steady since , with many younger people relocating to places like @entity125 , @entity126 and @entity127			1
the 1970 's also marked the rise of @entity105 and a popularity among surrounding states like @entity131 , @entity132 and @entity133			1
there was also a strong growth all over @entity58			0
in the 1980 's , @entity115 emerged as the fastest growing @entity2 state			2
despite strong competition from @entity137 , which had introduced almost - identical gaming laws in the late seventies , @entity115 continued to increase			0
by 1990 , it measured a population of 1.2 million , with many contributing the number to the opening of @entity144 in 1989 , which at the time was the greatest casino @entity146 , if not the world , had seen			0

new database uses @entity14 figures dating back to the 1950 's to calculate population *trends*
results show how states like @entity105 and @entity115 have grown *exponentially* over time
clearest consistency is the amount of people who have left the @entity3
causes *thought* to have *stemmed* from brain drain , white flight and *post-industrialization*
