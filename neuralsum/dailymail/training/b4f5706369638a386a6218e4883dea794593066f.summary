' i first met @entity6 in 1987 and i have been a close friend of @entity6 since that time			1

i freely answered all the questions that the police asked of me , ' he added			2
' the easy option would be to say nothing , but that is not who i am			0
i want to address this myself directly			0
' the woman was reported to be a nurse who now lives in @entity138 after she made a formal complaint to police last year			2
' the police have conducted an investigation they have vigorously and thoroughly investigated it and the matter is now closed , ' mr @entity6 added			1
' the decision speaks for itself i have no intention after this statement to talk about it any further			0
' late last year i learned that a claim had been made about me , going back to when i was nineteen			0
it was made on social media , when i was elected @entity150			0
i will not go into details , except to say that the allegation was untrue and abhorrent			1
the allegation was made by someone i knew briefly at that time			2
there is absolutely no basis for the claim			0

i fully cooperated to clear my name			0
and that is what i have done			0
