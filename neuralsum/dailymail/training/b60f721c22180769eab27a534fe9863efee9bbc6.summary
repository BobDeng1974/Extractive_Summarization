a grandmother who won a custom - built $ 180,000 @entity2 supercar is selling it - because her suv is more practical for the grocery run			1
@entity6 , of @entity7 in @entity8 , won the vehicle - based on @entity11 's most iconic car the @entity12 - after her teenage son bought the game with her credit card in 2012			1
without her knowledge , the 56 - year - old had been automatically entered into a competition to win the high performance vehicle and was stunned when it was dropped off outside her home			2
the game 's designers , @entity30 , commissioned @entity32 's @entity31 to immortalize the @entity12 and modify a @entity33 for the competition			1
after three years of driving the flashy car , ms @entity6 has decided it 's time to sell up - to the dismay of her 19 - year - old son @entity38			1
she said : ' it is not a practical car			2
i actually have a mini suv that i prefer driving because this car has no space			0
@entity45 favourite : the @entity12 pictured as it is seen in the hugely - popular @entity2 games mixed emotions : ms @entity6 's son @entity38 is devastated to see the car go - but the money paid for it will go towards his college fund ' you can probably get two people and maybe a purse in it - the entire trunk is filled with stereo equipment			1
the @entity12 is one of @entity11 's most popular cars			1
and here 's why : speed : 0 - 60mph in 4.3 seconds top speed : 174 mph ranking : 5th fastest car in the game engine : 8.4 liter twin - turbocharged @entity67 the car also has excellent handling and the best braking of any vehicle on the game - making it perfect to race in			1
source : @entity76 ' it does not fit in our area at all - it 's pretty rare to see a car like this			2
' i get tickled when people see who is driving it - they 'll often speed up to get a good look and are always surprised when they see a 56 - year - old woman behind the wheel			0
' she admits she was shocked when it first arrived and has enjoyed some of the attention the car gets her			0
she added : ' it was very out of the blue i did not believe it for a minute - i thought it was a scam			0
it 's a very fast car - i have never had my foot on the floor			0
' it will go so fast so quickly that i 've been told you need to keep it in a straight line to keep it on the road - it feels like you 're flying			0
' but it 's fun to drive , everywhere you go it turns heads - people want to look at it and talk to you			0
' custom - made : the game 's designers - @entity30 - commissioned @entity32 's @entity31 - to immortalize the @entity12 and modify a @entity33 for the competition iconic : the @entity12 has featured in all of the modern @entity2 games , the last of which sold more than 32 million copies worldwide enjoyed the attention : ms @entity6 admitted the car was ' fun to drive ' , adding : ' everywhere you go it turns heads - people want to look at it and talk to you ' but driving a customized car can make parts extremely expensive and the grandmother says many are inaccessible and impossible to replace			1
with a heavy heart the family is looking to offload the @entity12 to a collector who can afford to take care of it - and they are going to use the money so send ms @entity6 's son @entity38 to college			1
' i 'll be happy and sad to see it go ' , added @entity6			0
' it is a fun car i enjoy driving it but at the same time it takes up space in our home and it 's not practical to drive to the grocery store in it			2
' according to @entity31 and @entity30 the car is valued at $ 180,000 dollars but i 'd be happy getting $ 70,000 ( Â£ 45,000 ) for it			1
' the decision to sell the @entity149 has been hard on ms @entity6 's 19 - year - old son @entity38			1
the @entity12 comes in a number of different colours and can reach speeds of up to 174mph on the game how it looks in the game : the flashy - looking supercar is one of the fastest and most elusive vehicles in the game			2
above , a scene from @entity11 expensive : according to @entity31 and @entity30 the car is valued at $ 180,000 dollars the entire trunk of the supercar is filled with stereo equipment - rendering it unpractical for grocery runs he said : ' when i first got in the car it i felt like i was dreaming			2
i have been playing @entity2 for most of my life , it is an amazing game - nothing else has anything on those games			0
' but despite his disappointment , he realises the car has got to go			0
@entity38 added : ' it 's a really nice car but we need the money for other things , we do n't need the car to be happy			0
' i would rather go to college than have this car - i 'm sad to see it go but i know i had some good times with it			0
