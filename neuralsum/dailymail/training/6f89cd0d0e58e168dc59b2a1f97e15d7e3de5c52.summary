they say pride comes before a fall , but rarely do the falls come as big as the one which saw @entity7 sevens player @entity6 thrown to the ground by @entity10 's @entity9 on saturday			1
@entity7 were taking on @entity12 's side in a @entity14 clash at the @entity15 in @entity16 when @entity6 burst through the @entity18 defence for what looked like a certain try			0
but such was @entity6 's confidence that he stopped sprinting and sauntered past the try - line before stopping inside the in - goal area			2
@entity9 sensed what was happening and raced back to take out the @entity25 with a brutally executed tackle			0
video : never give up ! @entity6 gets clattered by @entity9 @entity7 's @entity6 saunters into the in - goal area before being smashed by @entity10 's @entity9 the ball went flying out of the lock 's hands and away to safety , much to his embarrassment and @entity9 's delight			1
unfortunately for the @entity18 , the bit of schadenfreude was as good as it got for them as @entity7 cruised to a 40 - 7 victory			0
@entity6 lies on the floor after @entity9 senses his complacency and throws him to the floor the lock stopped running when he got to within five yards of the try line and failed to ground the ball @entity6 finished the match try-less and he will surely never hesitate again before grounding the ball once clear			0
the win helped @entity7 top @entity14 and consigned @entity10 to a third - placed finish which sees them exit the main tournament and go into the bowl competition the ball went flying and no try was awarded after the @entity25 got bundled off the pitch by @entity9			1

*hilarious* *incident* happened at the @entity15 on saturday
@entity7 beat @entity10 40 - 7 but the match will be *remembered* for the tackle
@entity6 sauntered into the in - goal area but did *n't* ground the ball
@entity10 's @entity9 sprinted back and took @entity6 out with a *perfectly* executed tackle
@entity7 topped @entity14 but @entity10 finished third so exit the main tournament and go into the bowl competition
