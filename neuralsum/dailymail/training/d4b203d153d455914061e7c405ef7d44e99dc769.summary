the shamed former @entity3 chief has committed nothing more than a ‘ crime of lust ’ , @entity18 barrister @entity17 claimed			1
he was speaking after the 62 - year - old economist was charged in @entity20 with ‘ complicity in pimping in an organised vice gang ’ , which carries a maximum prison sentence of 20 years			1
@entity2 is acccused of knowingly using prostitutes paid for by two businessmen who were illegally using company funds to organise sex parties in @entity28 and @entity29			0
the charges come as a judge in @entity32 will decide today whether the man once tipped to be the next @entity20 president should face civil action from a hotel chambermaid over attempted rape allegations , or whether he can claim diplomatic immunity from the charges			0
in the @entity20 case , at least five prostitutes told police they had sex with @entity2			0
one told detectives she attended 11 orgies with him , adding : ‘ i got the feeling he liked rough sex			2
’ but mr @entity17 said he and his client would now do everything in their power to have the charges brought by two judges in @entity57 on monday night dismissed			2
' mr @entity2 is finding himself , in large part because of his fame , thrown to the wolves			0
' @entity74 police and judicial means were deployed to crack and dissect his private life to an infinite degree , with the only goal being to invent and then castigate what can be considered a crime of lust			1
' and what a strange co-incidence that all this should happen a month from a major national election			0
' the vice ring under investigation operated out of the @entity62 in @entity57			1
@entity2 had been widely tipped to stand as the socialist candidate in next month ’s presidential election , with polls showing he would easily beat right - wing rival @entity90			2
@entity2 and his wife @entity91 , who stood by him during rape charges charges last year but his political ambitions were wrecked when he was arrested for allegedly trying to rape @entity32 hotel chambermaid @entity95 last may			2
after being held in @entity32 ’s notorious @entity99 ’s @entity98 prison , criminal charges were dropped and he returned to @entity20 only to face similar accusations of sexually abusing a young @entity20 writer			0

@entity2 has confessed to attending orgies in @entity20 and @entity111 , but claims he never knew the girls were hookers because ‘ they were all naked at the time ’			1
his lawyer @entity115 said earlier this year : ' at these parties , people were not dressed , and i defy you to tell the difference between a naked prostitute and any other naked woman			0
' during the vice network investigation , it emerged that @entity57 police chief @entity125 had organised an eight - person orgy for @entity2 at a luxury @entity18 hotel in 2010			1
@entity57 businessman @entity129 and three other men are also accused of providing hookers for @entity2 in a bid to curry favour with the man then tipped to be the next @entity20 president			0
