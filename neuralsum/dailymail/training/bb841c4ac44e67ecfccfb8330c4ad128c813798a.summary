by @entity0 published : 09:28 est , 16 october 2013 updated : 09:29 est , 16 october 2013 moose populations are declining rapidly and could disappear from some states in @entity3			1
but while scientists have noticed the steep drop in numbers in @entity7 , @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10 , the reason for the animal 's plight remains a mystery			1
scientists ' theories range from brainworms infecting animals to ticks sucking their blood that could be depleting populations but it seems that global warming could be a common theme			1
biologist @entity25 , of the @entity26 , who counts moose in the state , told the @entity29 ' there 's fewer moose out there , and hunters are working harder to find them ' @entity7 had two separate moose populations just 20 years ago but one of them has all but vanished , while the other is falling from 25 per cent a year to around 3,000 animals , despite hunting permits almost halving since 1995			1

one theory is that climate change is damaging moose populations			2
winters are shorter and @entity53 milder in @entity8 , leading to the animals suffering from more parasitic ticks			1
moose living in @entity7 have been found to have brain worms and liver flukes - parasitic flatworms that feed on blood and are located in the liver that spend most of their lives in snails that live in moist areas			2
global warming could also be affecting moose as the creatures , which are built for cold weather , can expend extra energy staying cool in milder weather , which can make them exhausted and even kill them			2

global warming could also be affecting moose as the creatures , which are built for cold weather , can expend extra energy staying cool in milder weather , which can make them exhausted and even kill them another recent study found moose living in mountains in @entity10 have suffered habitat loss as an epidemic of pine beetles have stripped forests bare , leaving the animals exposed to human and animal predators			1
experts believe unregulated hunting might also play a role in increasing moose mortality rates			0
as autumn approaches , which is when most moose die , scientists hope to solve the mystery of why populations have been hit so hard			0
@entity100 , a former vet at the @entity101 , said : ' it ’s complicated because there ’s so many pieces of this puzzle that could be impacted by climate change			0
' experts said moose deaths are hard to study as they are solitary animals and consequently can be difficult to track			0
when they die , the animals have so much body fat that their bodies decompose quickly , leaving few clues behind for scientists			0
researchers think ticks ( pictured ) are partially responsible for declining numbers of moose			0
they lose a lot of blood and become anemic , tearing out their fur so that in springtime , despite broadly warmer temperatures , the animals can die of hypothermia as they are without their warm , waterproof coats @entity7 began a $ 1.2million study using cutting - edge technology to find moose as quickly as possible after they die , by fitting live animals with collars that show researchers their location every 15 minutes			1
if an animal 's heart stops beating , the collars send a text message with its coordinates so scientists can recover the body to looks for causes of death			0
researchers are relatively sure that ticks are partially responsible for declining numbers of moose			0
the animals lose a lot of blood and become anemic , tearing out their fur and becoming ' crazy ' so that in springtime , despite broadly warmer temperatures , the animals can die of hypothermia as they are without their warm , waterproof coats .			0
