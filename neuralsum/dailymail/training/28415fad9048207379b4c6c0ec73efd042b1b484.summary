what christening gift do you choose for the boy who is going to have everything ? a £ 7,000 silver sculpture of his hands and feet , of course			1
at least , that ’s what @entity8 has bought for her baby nephew , @entity10			0
and while the unusual gift may strike some as a little creepy , miss @entity8 evidently thinks it ’s cute			0
to create the moulds , the three - month - old future king would have had his limbs placed in a jelly - like organic mixture made of water and a seaweed - based powder			1
the process takes only 30 seconds – but as any mother would testify , that ’s a long time for a wriggling newborn to sit still			0
whether @entity43 and @entity44 knew about the extravagant gift in advance is unknown			0
according to @entity47 and @entity48 , the company which makes the sculptures , baby hands and feet ‘ life cast in silver ’ , are ‘ a perfect keepsake to preserve precious memories in the finest materials ’			1
each set comes with personalised engravings			0
prices start at £ 1,900 for a pair of bronze hands and feet			1
for solid silver – the traditional christening metal – buyers can pay anything upwards of £ 6,200 , depending on the size of the child and the engravings			1
it costs at least £ 3,000 for a pair of feet and £ 3,200 for the hands			1
it is believed miss @entity8 may have spent as much as £ 7,000			1
the company , which began in a south @entity33 studio in 2000 , has no fixed price for a gold set			0
buyers can also choose cufflinks or a necklace featuring miniature versions of the sculptures			2
happy occasion : the proud parents are walked from the chapel by @entity85 , the archbishop of @entity86 who had just baptised @entity10 senior royals : the @entity88 and the @entity89 are followed from the chapel by the @entity91 and his wife the @entity92			0
they and prince @entity94 were the only close members of @entity44 's family who attended smiling and happy : the @entity89 and @entity43 grinned at their family as they held their young prince at the big event on wednesday colourful : the @entity101 detachment of @entity102 turns out in @entity103 , @entity101 , for the arrival of @entity88 , ahead of the christening miss @entity8 , party - planner and socialite , may have taken her inspiration from one of little @entity10 ’s ancestors			1
in the mid- 1880s , queen @entity110 commissioned sculptor @entity111 to carve her nine children ’s hands , feet and limbs in alabaster			2
the figures certainly influenced @entity47 , one of the founders of @entity47 and @entity48 , to begin sculpting limbs in bronze , silver and gold			1
a spokesman for @entity123 would not confirm or deny that the sculptures had been given as a present			0
he said : ‘ if such a gift exists it would be a private gift and not be something we would be aware of			0
’ meanwhile members of the @entity131 chose a more traditional gift for the baby prince – a hand - crafted pine toy box , which cost £ 400			1
although for a slightly more modest option , they needed to go no further than @entity10 ’s own grandfather , prince @entity136			2
he lies on queen @entity110 ’s lap — a baby who will live to see the @entity140 , held in the arms of a woman born in the reign of @entity144 the official portrait for the christening of @entity147 of @entity30 , photographed in @entity148 at @entity123 in @entity33 yesterday line of succession : the queen is flanked by @entity44 holding @entity10 and @entity136			0
the first time a @entity153 monarch has been pictured with three heirs since @entity88 @entity110 his @entity156 label has launched a range of baby gifts and toys , including a £ 195 ‘ baby hamper ’ with chamomile and mandarin organic toiletries			2
the products retail for around £ 25 individually , and have ‘ been developed to be calm and gentle on delicate skin ’			2
the @entity156 website also offers a commemorative mug honouring @entity10 ’s birth , for £ 20			2
all profits from the sale of @entity156 products are donated to the @entity136 ’s @entity172 , a charity which supports a range of causes and organisations .			0

the ' life casts ' were made from moulds of the young prince 's limbs
@entity183 and @entity48 call them a ' perfect keepsake to preserve precious memories in the finest materials '
