' he said the attack had an impact on his two - year - old daughter and five - year - old son			0
' my son knows his daddy is a police officer , he sees me as indestructible - it was hard to see him so upset when he saw that i 'd been hurt			2

' judge @entity99 jailed @entity7 for 28 months in a young offenders institution			1
judge @entity99 told the court : ' he is a police officer out there in the community doing his duty , keeping us , the public , safe and police officers must expect and will get support from the courts in these sorts of cases			1

orthopaedic surgeons were forced to install a metal pin into @entity16 's leg , right , to stabalise the unusual break ' there is no justification for that level of violence , especially against people who are there to protect genuine members of the public who want to have a safe and enjoyable night out			1
' the majority of people want to have a safe night out but with some people there 's been a noticeable decline in the attitude towards police			2
' nothing appears to be off - limits from verbal abuse to spitting to being assaulted			0
' this type of behaviour is dealt with robustly but we should n't need to when all we 're there to do is ensure people have a safe night out			0

' we accept , with the job we do , there will be occasions where you suffer injuries but not to this extent			0
' @entity16 was simply trying to do his job and help a colleague when @entity7 lashed out , injuring both officers			1
' @entity24 has quite rightly received a custodial sentence for such an aggressive response to our presence while trying to resolve a separate dispute			0
' hopefully this case demonstrates that violence in the night time economy , whether towards a member of the public or a police officer , is not acceptable			1
' @entity193 assistant chief constable , @entity192 , said : ' officers on the frontline routinely face danger - it 's the nature of the job			0
' however , to attack anyone in this way , including a police officer , is a serious matter and the sentence shows the courts will not tolerate such despicable behaviour			1
