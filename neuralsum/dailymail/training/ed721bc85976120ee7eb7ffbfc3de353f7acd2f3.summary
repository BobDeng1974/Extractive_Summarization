by @entity0 published : 05:09 est , 6 november 2012 updated : 05:09 est , 6 november 2012 @entity1 decided to have a preventative mastectomy to significantly reduce her risk of cancer a woman who discovered she had the breast cancer gene has spoken out about why she decided to have both breasts removed			1
@entity1 's story echoes that of former x factor judge @entity10 who has revealed she underwent a double mastectomy after learning she carried the gene			1
like @entity10 , mrs @entity1 from @entity14 , @entity15 , had the operation because she could n’t bear to live under the shadow of cancer			1
she said : ‘ i applaud @entity10 for talking about her mastectomy			1
our stories are very similar			0
like me she ’d had a breast augmentation before finding out she carried the gene			1
' we were both healthy at the time but did n’t want to spend our lives worrying about getting cancer			2
it has not been easy but it was the best decision i ever made			0
’ the 46 - year - old mother of two @entity1 discovered she carried the faulty gene in 2009 after her father @entity29 had been treated for breast cancer			1
he ’d needed a mastectomy and after 12 months of chemotherapy , made a full recovery			2
as her grandmother had also died of the disease aged 55 , mrs @entity1 , a receptionist , was invited for screening tests to see if she carried the faulty gene			1
she said : ‘ i had always wondered if there was a link but when the letter arrived offering me a test i was terrified			0
’ at the time , she was just seven months away from marrying her fiance @entity42 , 46			2
tragically , he had been widowed when his first wife @entity44 died of cancer aged 45			1
she said : ‘ i was frightened about having the tests , but as well as my own two children i owed it to @entity42 and his sons to find out if i carried the gene or not			1
he had already lost one wife to cancer			2
i was not going to let him go through that again			0
’ mrs @entity1 took her father with her for the tests and waited 14 days for the results			1
mrs @entity1 underwent testing for the breast cancer gene after her father @entity29 developed it			1
tests revealed she had an 85 per cent chance of getting breast cancer she said : ‘ it was horrendous			1
i would have nightmares about cancer and tumours every night and checked my breasts for changes every day			2
’ finally the consultant called her with the results			0
@entity1 said : ‘ she asked me to come in but i begged her to tell me on the phone			1
when she said it was positive and i had a gene that gave me an 85 per cent increased risk of breast cancer i was stunned			1
‘ i was crying as she explained having a double mastectomy would dramatically reduce the risk			1
‘ initially it felt like an awful choice to make , lose my breasts or risk my life			2
i ’d had a boob job nine years earlier and took great pride in my figure , but then i thought about @entity42 ’s wife @entity44 and how she had never been given that chance			0
‘ i started to see it as blessing , i had been one of the lucky ones			0
the test had given me a chance to save my life			0
’ mrs @entity1 with her husband @entity42			1
the couple were due to wed seven months after she received the devastating news , and she delayed surgery until after the wedding later she explained to her fiance that a double mastectomy would reduce her chances of getting breast cancer to just 10 per cent , lower than the average person 's 15 per cent			1
‘ i knew i wanted to have the operation and @entity42 wholeheartedly agreed with me			0
my only concern was having the surgery before my wedding			0
’ having already bought her strapless dress , she did n’t want to risk not being fully recovered in time for her big day			2
so she spoke to her consultant about delaying the mastectomy until after her wedding day and honeymoon			2
‘ i told the specialist the date and they agreed it would be fine as long as i checked for any changes in my breasts every day			0
‘ deep down i admit i wanted to enjoy my wedding and honeymoon with my breasts			0
a tiny part of me feared i was risking my life just to look good on my wedding day , but my consultant agreed the risk was minimal over such a short space of time			2
’ after their wedding in july 2009 , the couple spent two weeks in the @entity125			0
the couple married in july 2009 and mrs @entity1 underwent nine hours of surgery to remove her breasts in january 2010 ‘ i wore my bikini every day , it was almost like saying goodbye to my breasts , ’ she said			1
after several postponements , she was finally admitted to hospital for the nine - hour operation to remove both her breasts in january 2010			2
mrs @entity1 had hoped to have reconstructive surgery at the same time , but after the mastectomy she was told the skin had been too tight to insert the implants during the operation			1
instead , surgeons needed to start a procedure to stretch the skin using saline sacs			0
she later had reconstructive surgery but her implants failed and had to be removed			0
she is now hoping her reconstructive surgery will be complete soon			0
she said : ‘ it ’s been hard but i do n’t regret my decision for a minute			0
' i do n’t have to live under the shadow of cancer and losing my breasts is a small price to pay to live without fear			2
‘ my daughter @entity152 turns 18 next year and she will have the screening test to see if she carries the gene			1
' she has already told me if it ’s positive she wants the mastectomy and i would support her every step of the way			0
‘ @entity10 talking about this only helps to make the decision easier for other women			0
but like she said , it ’s not brave , it ’s simple			0
we want to be around to see our families grow up			0
