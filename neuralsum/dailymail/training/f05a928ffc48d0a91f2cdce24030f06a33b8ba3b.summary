by @entity0 when the @entity5 condo complex was first built one of its main selling points was its beautiful ocean views			1
enjoying lunch on the balcony overlooking the @entity10 coastline was one of the biggest advantages of living at the @entity14 complex			2
now the sea views have been replaced with the sights of coffins and mourners crying after a nearby memorial park started carrying out burial services on a rooftop mausoleum just feet from the apartments			1
@entity37 , 26 , told @entity39 @entity38 : ' i 've seen many funerals			0
' they ’ve brought the caskets up this way so everything comes up and down the ramp			0
it ’s sad , it ’s upsetting , it ’s frustrating , it ’s my home			0
' @entity51 said when he first moved into the complex in 2006 he accepted that he could see and hear the services , which were then held at a distance			1
but he said his living conditions had changed drastically since the services had moved to just outside his apartment			2
he told the @entity57 : ' we ’re sitting there eating brunch on the weekends and we have people right outside our window crying their eyes out			0
' residents have now warned their properties could decrease in value following @entity69 @entity33 's decision to start holding services on the rooftop mausoleum which lies just 50ft from some of their balconies @entity75 , president and ceo of @entity77 , told @entity78 that the mausoleum was built with the city 's consent			1
he said he had ' never envisioned the level of negative response ' from residents but had tried to reduce the noise of the services , put a limit on when services took place and attempted to hide the view from residents with screens			2
he said : ' a demand to make me stop doing funerals altogether in a cemetery , or to move a building that was constructed with full approval of the city that we are governed by , that 's not a possibility			0
' according to @entity101 , the memorial park has sent the residents a cease and desist letter , demanding they stop disrupting funeral services			1
both parties will be attending the @entity107 meeting on august 12			0
@entity77 was founded in 1948 and has since held services for more than 75,000 families			2
according to its website , the memorial park started as a partnership between business owners and members of the local community			1
it still operates as a not - for - profit organisation .			0
