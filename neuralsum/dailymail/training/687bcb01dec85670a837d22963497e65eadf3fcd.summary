by @entity0 @entity1 looked like he was preparing for life in @entity3 as he dazzled his @entity5 team - mates in training with a samba dance			1
the @entity8 superstar is known for bamboozling defenders with a quick shimmy of his hips and he put those skills to good use by dancing around the ball as team - mate @entity15 ran in to tackle him			2
@entity17 , @entity1 's pal at @entity8 and the national side , looked very impressed and began to do his own samba wiggle in response			0
but the @entity5 hatchetman displayed a little less grace than the @entity24 winner			0
scroll down to watch @entity1 's samba dance @entity27 style : @entity1 ( second left ) shows his dancing skills to the delight of his @entity5 pals quick step : the @entity8 star shuffled his hips to confuse team - mate @entity15 ( right ) snap him up for @entity34 ! @entity17 ( second right ) looked especially impressed with the superstar 's skills @entity1 gave @entity5 a boost on the eve of the @entity40 by resuming training ahead of tuesday 's friendly against the @entity42 at the @entity43 in @entity44			1
the 29 - year - old @entity8 forward has been struggling with tendinosis in his knee and a muscle injury in his left thigh since the end of the domestic campaign and there were serious fears he may miss @entity5 ’s opening game of the @entity40 against @entity55 on june 16			2
however , the @entity56 confirmed encouraging news on saturday , nine days before the country 's opener in @entity60			0
close control : @entity1 shows off his silky ball skills during @entity5 training injury doubts : @entity1 is working back to full fitness following thigh and knee problems when in the @entity68 ... @entity1 throws an @entity69 while warming up during training in @entity44 @entity1 inspired @entity8 to their 10th @entity74 title - @entity72 - last season and has now spoken of his desire to add the @entity40 to his huge trophy haul			1
but @entity5 are far from favourites for the @entity40 – they have been drawn in a tricky group alongside @entity55 , @entity79 and the @entity68 , so reaching the knockout stages will be far from easy .			0

@entity1 showed his @entity3 - style dance moves during training
team - mate @entity17 looked impressed with the @entity8 star
