@entity1 inventor sir @entity0 has revealed he is working on an affordable robot to carry out chores around the house			1
the entrepreneur said this week he will announce a £ 5 million investment in a new robotics laboratory at @entity8 to develop the technology			1
sir @entity0 said soon a ' new generation of robot that understands the world around them will be able to clean the house , put out the bins and even keep an eye out for intruders '			1
inventor @entity0 has said he will invest £ 5million in a new robotics laboratory sir @entity0 claims his firm currently competing with @entity23 rivals to become the first to create an advanced generation of household robots			1
@entity26 , a humanoid robot that can help with housework and nursing care , has already been unveiled by @entity30 in @entity31 and will be on sale within a few years			1
it has also been speculated that @entity33 is building an android army after recently acquiring a number of robotic and artificial intelligence companies			2
sir @entity0 told @entity37 : ' domestic use will be the initial focus of the research			1
what robots need to function in the home is vision and the ability to interact intelligently			2
' last year , @entity0 launched a £ 150million facility full of robots - but sir @entity0 admits they are inefficient : ' they perform precise , highly controlled movements in an environment that does n’t change			1
' in a complex environment – the home or garden – a machine must understand and perceive its environment			2
such technology would have wide ranging application			2
this is a starting point , and we will have to see where it leads - and that is what 's exciting			2
' sir @entity0 unveils his invention , the @entity65 hand drier , in @entity66 , @entity67 @entity26 , a humanoid robot that can help with housework and nursing care , has already been unveiled by @entity30 in @entity31 a £ 5 million investment will be made in a new robotics laboratory at @entity8			1
pictured here is @entity8 's main entrance to its @entity76 campus the £ 5million investment is crucial for the @entity1 to catch up with markets in the @entity79 and @entity23 , where robots are already a growing commodity , sir @entity0 claims			1
he told @entity37 : ' the @entity79 and @entity23 are leading the charge			1
always the early adopters , they are n't afraid of taking risks when it comes to new technology			2
' they have seen the unprecedented potential in robotics and are actively investing in research and development			0
' that does n't mean to say we do n't have the capability here in the @entity1			0
we have some of the @entity97 's leading universities , brimming with brilliant minds			0
and our digital motors are some of the smallest , most efficient motors in the world – they spin at over 110,000rpm			0
' all it takes is time and funding			0
combining these developments will lead to previously unthinkable technologies			0
' he adds that the project is also aimed at rebooting @entity1 's dwindling engineering industry , a major stumbling block to the advance of robotics			0
' we should be encouraging @entity1 companies to invest in r&d and take on engineers so that they can grow and compete with the @entity97 's leading technology companies			1
' research and development is a slow burn			0
long - term thinking is essential to new technology			0
' the move has sparked fears among critics who warn artificial intelligence is a slippery slope			0
but sir @entity0 claims we have already crossed the threshold			1
he told @entity37 : ' we already have robots all around us			0
and , if we are to compete with the likes of the @entity79 and @entity23 we have to take risks , explore the unexplored			1
' the @entity1 has a rich history of being the forerunner in new technology and we should endeavour to continue this trend			0
' an important strand to what we are doing is working closely with @entity1 academia to apply research – to make sure @entity1 industry can turn ideas into tangible technologies			0
' as long as universities , the students in them , and industry continues to benefit and to progress then there is nothing to be fearful of			0

@entity151 will invest in a new lab at @entity8
he said soon a ' new generation of robot ' will be available
sir @entity0 is currently competing with @entity23 firms
