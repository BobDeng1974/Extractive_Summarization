ms @entity9 - who was previously married to @entity10 , founder of high street chain @entity11 - pocketed a £ 37million divorce settlement a decade ago , said sir @entity4			1

@entity5 ( left ) has been ordered to pay his ex-wife @entity22 ( right ) a £ 17million divorce settlement the judge said the eight - figure sum he awarded ms @entity9 could be described as ' restorative justice '			1
he also ordered mr @entity5 to pay ms @entity9 's £ 456,000 legal bills			1
details of the award emerged in a ruling by the judge following private hearings in the @entity32 of the @entity32 in @entity33			1
sir @entity4 said the couple had separated in 2013 after marrying in 2006 , having entered into a pre-nuptial agreement			0
the judge said that , at the time of the agreement , ms @entity9 had disclosed assets of nearly £ 32.3million and mr @entity5 assets of about £ 8.3million			1
ms @entity9 's lawyer , @entity40 , said after the ruling that her client had never sought any of mr @entity5 's money for herself			1
' she solely tried to ensure that a clear pre-nuptial agreement was abided by , ' said ms @entity40			0
' that agreement said that each of them should , if they divorced , simply be left in the same position they were in when they married			0
she added : ' accordingly , ms @entity9 has been trying to get back from mr @entity5 what was once hers alone , and which they agreed would always be hers alone in the future			0
' mr @entity5 sadly refused to honour the terms of the pre-nuptial agreement			0
' it is the second big - money divorce settlement for ms @entity9 , who was awarded £ 37million after a previous split mrs @entity9 is the daughter of @entity59 and his wife , @entity60 , both hairdressers			1

she and mr @entity5 , a @entity68 national who is a well - known figure in @entity70 thanks to his flourishing hospitality empire , were married overseas			2
the judge said mr @entity73 ( left ) was ' an unprincipled rogue who has acted in a financially predatory fashion to prey on his wife ' their acrimonious divorce battle emerged earlier this year , when it was revealed they were squabbling over their £ 40million fortune			1
when the pre-nup was made , ms @entity9 owned an £ 11million house in @entity33 and a property in @entity86 in the @entity87 valued at £ 7million			2
mr @entity5 claimed that , as a result of his organisation of her business interests , his ex-wife profited by more than £ 20million			2
but the judge branded the @entity68 's claim ' demonstrably nonsense ' today			1
a key bone of contention was a £ 13.8million loan a company owned by @entity22 made to a company owned by @entity5			2
ms @entity9 said her background was ' fashion and design - orientated ' and had told sir @entity4 ' my forte is not financial matters '			0
she said mr @entity5 had told her that he was an ' experienced investor and financial expert ' and she had ' trusted ' his advice and he had told her that she ' did not need to worry '			0
the judge today ordered that the inter-company debt be repaid to ms @entity9			2
the ruling comes after another judge sentenced mr @entity5 to four months in jail in may for contempt of court for failing to disclose information relating to the loan to court			2
the court heard today that he remains in @entity70 and has not served the sentence			2
he previously said that , in @entity120 , ' the coffee is terrible , especially in prison i guess '			0
sir @entity4 said mr @entity5 had not appeared at hearings , but he said he had ' read a good deal that emanates from him '			0
' in regard to his wife and since their relationship broke down he has manifested a manipulative and , it might even be said , a sadistic side to his personality , ' said sir @entity4 , adding : ' he can be haughty , menacing and downright rude in tone			0
' sir @entity4 said mr @entity5 had called his wife and her lawyers ' insignificant pieces of s * * * '			0
he said mr @entity5 had ' bombarded ' ms @entity9 with communications during the course of proceedings which were ' sneering , superior and supercilious ' in tone			0
and he asked : ' so why does @entity5 so steadfastly refrain from honouring his word rather than run the risk that one might conclude ( as i have done ) that he is an unprincipled rogue who has acted in a financially predatory fashion to prey on his wife for his own profit and to her substantial detriment ? ' in a statement released in may , ms @entity150 sent out a warning to the media against ' repeating the offensive suggestion that despite being a successful journalist and businesswoman i have somehow made a career out of marrying for money			0
' @entity9 , pictured with previous first husband @entity10 , said the money originally belonged to her			1

property *tycoon* ordered to pay his ex-wife £ 17million divorce settlement
