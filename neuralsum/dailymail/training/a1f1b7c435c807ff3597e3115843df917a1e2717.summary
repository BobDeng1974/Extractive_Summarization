by @entity1 reporter published : 10:53 est , 3 september 2012 updated : 11:01 est , 4 september 2012 @entity2 is poised to send trucks filled with cash into @entity5 as part of plans being adopted by @entity9 firms in the event of the country crashing out of the euro			1
with @entity5 teetering on the brink of a chaotic exit from the @entity17 , @entity9 banks and consulting firms have drawn up contingency plans for the financial turbulence that would follow			1
@entity20 is one of the firms preparing to bring in large amounts of the drachma , @entity5 's former currency which is expected to be used if they leave the @entity26 , in order to pay employees in case the banks shut during the transition and access to cash is hard to come by			1
ongoing issue : the financial crisis in @entity5 has often turned into protests , like the one these police are preparing for here in 2010 , but now it is more of a concern of how to facilitate a transition out of the @entity26 going back : long considered the last resort , financial analysts feel the country will revert back to its former currency called the @entity46 , and now it is only a matter of when the switch will happen following fifteen months of increasingly dramatic negotiations , the debt crisis has reached the point where financial analysts are n't talking about if but when it will happen			1
the @entity55 spoke to experts who expect that such a grave decision would be announced after the close of business on a friday after markets are finished for the weekend			0
then , if the country were to revert from the @entity26 , the currency which it has used since 2001 , then it will require an extra bank holiday on monday to organize and distribute the new currency			2
@entity66 asserts that without further aid , @entity5 will be staring at certain bankruptcy and a return to the drachma			2
@entity71 , the @entity9 car company , has already programmed their computers within the country so that they are able to handle transactions in terms of drachma instead of euros , showing how imminent they expect the change to be			2
in such a situation , it would be nearly impossible for banks to rapidly hand out cash to consumers , leading the way for more confusion			0
' companies are asking some very granular questions , like " if a news release comes out on a friday night announcing that @entity5 has pulled out of the euro , what do we do ? " ' in some cases , companies have contingency plans in place , such as having someone take a train to @entity101 with 50,000 euros to pay employees , ' @entity93 of @entity94 told @entity103			1
@entity104 is new again : the country is expected to switch from the @entity26 ( right ) which they have used since 2001 to their former currency called @entity46 ( left ) contingency plans : banks are discussing driving trucks full of cash into @entity5 to help facilitate the transition if it were to happen , though the exact model of car is unknown			1
protestors shown here in 2008 attacked this bank transfer armored truck the fact that such drastic action is on the brink of becoming the solution was not expected by many inside @entity5 , though foreign advisers have been continually critical of the common @entity26 currency for the entirety of the crisis			1
' when we started giving advice , they came for the free sandwiches and chocolate cookies , ' @entity2 head of @entity130 @entity129 said jokingly the paper			0
' now that has changed , and contingency planning is focused on three primary scenarios â€” a single - country exit , a multi-country exit and a breakup of the euro zone in its entirety			0
' if @entity5 were to leave the @entity17 , @entity145 and @entity146 would be the next focus of the financial world as their own debt troubles could be alleviated to a degree by also reverting to their own currencies			2
@entity20 is not alone in preparing for further tremors within the @entity155			0
@entity156 and @entity157 both said that they have back - up plans and protocols in place so that they will be prepared if other countries also decide to leave the common currency			0
a spokesman for @entity20 said ' @entity2 has no current plan to send cash to @entity5 beyond our normal course of business			0
we are working closely as a priority with our many clients to ensure that they are fully prepared for all possible outcomes regarding the current issues affecting the eurozone			0

@entity5 is on brink of financial collapse and is expected to leave @entity26
@entity9 banks with clients in the country are now preparing contingency plans for how to get money to employees if the country 's banks close
