by @entity0 published : 19:03 est , 19 february 2013 updated : 08:20 est , 20 february 2013 @entity2 's swimming team at the @entity3 had a ' toxic culture ' that was not reined in by team leadership , according to a new report culture and leadership consultant dr @entity12 said the @entity3 represented almost the perfect storm of factors leading to a poor team culture , poor results and instances of bullying among team members			1
@entity17 wrote that a focus on individualised training regimes and not team training leading into the @entity21 led to a lack of bonding among athletes			2
the @entity2 swimming team won 20 medals at @entity27 , but only managed 10 at @entity3 this lack of team identity was exacerbated by a lack of leadership within the team and external factors such as media pressure , @entity17 added			1
@entity17 wrote the end result was a ' lonely ' @entity3 for many athletes who simply put their head down and got on with the job , while other athletes experienced issues with prescription drugs , alcohol and bullying			1
the report said : ' swimmers seemed to have missed the power of a shared experience , and critically , of friendship			2
in simplest terms this meant it was a lot less enjoyable than they expected			0
' it is plausible that emotional tension in the group built to disharmony and sometimes became exclusion and , in the rare extreme , animosity between athletes			0
' poor behaviour and disrespect within the team were not regulated or resisted strongly by other team members , and it was left unchecked or without consequence by staff and coaches on a number of occasions			1
@entity71 won five medals at the @entity21 , making her one of @entity2 's most successful athletes there ' some individual incidents of unkindness , peer intimidation , hazing and just ' bad form ' as a team member that were escalated to personal coaches were not addressed and had no further consequence			1
' standards , discipline and accountabilities for the swim team at the @entity3 were too loose			2
' there were enough culturally toxic incidents across enough team members that breached agreements ( such as getting drunk , misuse of prescription drugs , breaching curfews , deceit , bullying ) to warrant a strong , collective leadership response that included coaches , staff and the swimmers			1
' the @entity101 team arrived in @entity102 defending 20 medals from @entity27 2008			1
but the team only won 10 swimming medals , with just one gold			1
@entity17 said the media also played its role in the problems that eventuated and that the use of social media by athletes as they interacted with the general public proved a distraction			0
@entity17 wrote : ' there was no filter between the athlete and anyone who wanted to have an opinion on their performance , and that commentary did not need to be shaped with journalistic skill and experience , nor did it have any boundaries			0
' ' some athletes engaged deeply in public debate on what they were doing , how they were doing , and even on who they actually were as individuals			0
this served to fuel emotions , good and bad , at a time where calmness , intensive focus and consistency should have prevailed			0
' among dr @entity17 's six recommendations for @entity137 was the construction of an ethical framework that laid out what the team stood for and a major focus on developing a social media policy for athletes			2
she added : ' social media also allowed already disconnected athletes to seek support from sources external to the team , which again diminished the reliance on a unified team			0
' in addition , the glorification of a few was seen somewhere between embarrassing and irritating to other team members and added to a growing notion that the rest of the athletes were not really valued			0
' one person said he felt that it was not really about whether you swam your heart out , it was about whether you could sell your heart out			0

a report shows that the @entity2 swimming squad had poor team culture and bullying
it also *exposes* *allegations* of drugs and *excessive* *drinking*
the team left @entity102 with only 10 medals , and just one gold
