a mocked - up image of a plus - size @entity1 beside a traditional @entity1 has sparked a debate about the doll 's impact on female body image			1
the @entity7 group @entity8 shared the powerful post a week ago , with the question : ' should toy companies start making plus - sized @entity1 dolls ? in all honesty , we want to know ... ' since then , it has generated nearly 36,000 likes and over 1,600 shares - as well as mostly negative comments from many who felt the plus - size @entity1 was an inaccurate representation of curvy women			1
plus - size ... or obese ? a mocked - up image of a plus - size @entity1 beside a traditional @entity1 by @entity24 has sparked a debate about the doll 's impact on female body image one user , @entity28 , wrote : ' yeah lets promote poor health and eating habits			1
' and @entity33 - leg @entity34 commented : ' [ the ] average [ dress ] size these days is 14 - 16			0
a doll that shows real life perspective , rather than the ideal unhealthy weight like 0 or unhealthy negative display of obese is a better more healthy approach [ sic ]			2
' @entity42 added : ' i hope she comes with a blood pressure cuff to show young girls that how many chins she has is not what 's important but the health issues that could come along with being this size			0
' indeed , the doll 's chins , in particular , sparked ridicule			0
debate : the @entity7 group @entity8 shared this photo bearing the question : ' should toy companies start making plus - sized @entity1 dolls ? ' it has since generated nearly 36,000 likes and over 1,600 shares @entity61 wrote : ' i think the double chin is ridiculous ! ' and @entity64 said : ' the triple chin is too much			1
most overweight people ( me included ) only have a double chin no matter what size they are			0
' ' i hope she comes with a blood pressure cuff ... what 's important is the health issues that could come along with being this size ' the dominant opinion , though , was that that there should be a middle ground			0
rather than promoting an exaggerated ' obese ' @entity1 , young girls should have a healthy - looking doll that is neither too fat nor too thin			1
' why not have a realistically proportioned @entity1 that promotes healthy diet and exercise ? ' @entity81 suggested , while @entity82 wrote : ' not plus size but definitely healthy weight			2
a size 12 - 14 girl would be a great image			0
too low or too high a @entity88 promotes unhealthy living			0
' the image was produced by @entity92 rather than @entity1 's manufacturer , @entity94 , and so if the company was to consider a plus - size @entity1 , it might look very different			2
and nor is @entity92 the first to have considered the concept of a larger doll			0
barbie vs a ' healthy ' woman : artist @entity100 created a @entity1 - like doll based on @entity103 measurements of the average 19 - year - old woman , and photographed it alongside a traditional @entity1 doll artist @entity100 , 24 , from @entity106 , @entity107 , created a @entity1 - like doll based on @entity103 measurements of the average 19 - year - old woman , and photographed it alongside a traditional @entity1 doll			1
' if @entity1 looks good as an average sized woman in @entity31 , what 's stopping @entity94 from making one ? ' his research into the iconic doll found that if she were to exist as a human , @entity1 would weigh about 110lbs - or 7 stone , 8lbs - and would have a @entity88 of 16.24			1
this would fit the weight criteria for anorexia			0
he told @entity122 at the time : ' a realistically - proportioned @entity1 actually looks pretty good in the pictures i produced			2
' so , if there 's even a small chance of @entity1 in its present form negatively influencing girls , and if @entity1 looks good as an average sized woman in @entity31 , what 's stopping @entity94 from making one ? '			1

the @entity7 group @entity8 shared the powerful post with the question : ' should toy companies start making plus - sized @entity1 dolls ? '
many commenters believe that instead of an ' obese ' @entity1 , there should be a ' normal - sized ' doll that exemplifies healthy eating habits
