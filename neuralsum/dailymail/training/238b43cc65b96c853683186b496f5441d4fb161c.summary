by @entity0 published : 15:56 est , 7 april 2013 updated : 01:43 est , 8 april 2013 battle zone : the @entity3 fraudsters claimed conflicts had left them mentally ill fifty @entity3 drugged themselves to fake mental illness so they could carry out benefits fraud costing millions of pounds			1
the group won asylum in @entity10 after saying they had depression or post-traumatic stress syndrome from the conflict in @entity3			1
they then claimed disability payments plus housing benefits worth up to £ 2,000 a week in what was described as a ‘ wholesale onslaught on our welfare system ’			1
many of the fraudsters have @entity24 and @entity25 passports and were believed to be living and claiming further benefits in other @entity28 countries while also letting out their taxpayer - funded homes in @entity10			1
the scandal was exposed when @entity31 , anti-fraud tsar at @entity32 in @entity33 , raised the alarm following a massive increase in housing benefit claims after @entity37 introduced the generous local housing allowance in 2008			2
she said : ‘ the debate about the abuse of the welfare system is shrouded in political correctness			0
but this is not a witch - hunt , it ’s about criminality			0
‘ these men went to extreme lengths to commit benefits fraud			2
in some cases they would take drugs to fake delirium to convince doctors they had a mental disability or post-traumatic stress			1
‘ to keep the ruse up they would continue to regularly pick up the eight or nine medical drugs prescribed by doctors to treat their non-existent syndrome , which they would then dump , adding an extra cost to the @entity61			0
post traumatic stress : the fraudsters pretended to have mental health problems that have affected many who suffered during the war in @entity3 ‘ once you have secured disability living allowance on the basis of being a ptsd sufferer , the benefit can be granted indefinitely , so they could leave @entity10 and continue to receive the benefit			1
’ she said the scandal came to her attention after hard - working @entity3 residents in the area complained that fraud was out of control , but they were terrified of the repercussions of speaking out because of the criminal gang behind it			1
miss @entity31 added : ‘ in some of the blocks of flats we targeted , 95 per cent of the people living there were not the ones claiming housing benefit on the properties			0
‘ the costs from false housing benefits alone when we started investigating were more than £ 1milllion and historically could be far more than that			2
‘ at the same time we had to close down day care centres which played a vital role in the local community because we could n’t afford the £ 100,000 a year to keep them open			0
’ the @entity100 investigated and , with the @entity101 , has issued a warning to councils about the scandal			0
@entity100 said : ‘ in some instances corrupt professionals may have facilitated the criminal activity			0
’ the fraudsters would often provide false proof of employment , sometimes naming the same fictitious organisation , to qualify for housing benefit on the grounds of low pay			0
they would then claim up to £ 2,000 a week in rent			1
‘ complicit property agents may have been used to facilitate claimants ’ access to high rental value properties , ’ @entity100 added			0
illegal sub-letting of homes offered further gains and ‘ in several cases the original claimant was found to be no longer resident in the @entity10			2
‘ claimants who travelled overseas for sustained periods of over 12 weeks were still able to claim housing benefit and it is difficult for the @entity101 to establish if a claimant is travelling into or out of the @entity10			2

criminal gang won asylum in @entity10 claiming post traumatic stress *disorder*
they claimed benefits up to £ 2,000 a week , taking drugs to fake delirium
