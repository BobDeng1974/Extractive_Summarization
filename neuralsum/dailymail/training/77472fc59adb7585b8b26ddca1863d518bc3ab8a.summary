@entity0 is head of the equality and diversity team at @entity3 and @entity4 which drew up the guidelines bosses at an @entity8 trust have issued a bizarre list of guidelines to stop anyone at their @entity12 facing discrimination			1
the equality and diversity team at @entity3 and @entity15 assembled the list of discriminatory party pitfalls which include catering food for all religious , cultural and disability requirements			1
their leaked @entity21 seems to indicate that office parties in the @entity8 are viewed as a minefield of political correctness			2
the extraordinary briefing told party organisers that ' there could be the potential for claims of sexual discrimination ' if they did not ensure that the bash was scheduled for a time and location where women with ' caring responsibilities ' would be able to attend			1
it also warned staff that the staple of office parties - enjoying a few @entity43 drinks - could also be deemed discriminatory because people under 18 would not be able to join in			1
' if the venue is on licensed premises , there is the potential for age discrimination			2
think about how this difficulty could be overcome			2
if there is no age restriction on the venue , remind under 18s they should not be drinking alcohol			1
' the food on offer is also highlighted as a potential pitfall , with the authors stating : ' you need to cater for the needs of everyone attending the event to avoid discrimination			1
consider the religious and cultural requirements and possible adjustments for disabled employees			0
' managers were also told they should carry out ' a full risk assessment of possible risks before the party / event			1
this will serve to both reduce the risk of any accidents , and also assist in defending any claims should they happen			0
' it was drawn up by the equality and diversity team at @entity3 and @entity15			1
the head of the team is @entity0 - referred to in the briefing as ' @entity84 ' - who earns a £ 50,854 a year salary overseeing the hospital 's equality programme			0
last year the trust announced it would have to make £ 30m of cuts			0
@entity91 , chief executive of the @entity92 , today blasted the document as a ' total waste of money			1
' the guidelines from the @entity15 , which runs the @entity97 , have been ridiculed as a ' total waste of time ... and money ' he said : ' when we 're trying to make savings , having an employee write up commonsense rules for having fun at a @entity43 party seems like a total waste of time , effort , and taxpayers ' money			1
' the cost of the @entity111 continues to be placed on the back of hard - working ordinary people			0
' the briefing 's authors urge party organisers to choose a date which does not clash with other staff 's religious festivals or requirements , stating : ' it is important to enjoy yourself , but the @entity15 's @entity123 should be observed			1
' it also warns employees against calling in sick the next day with a hangover , stating : ' absence from work following @entity43 parties / events - it is worth remembering , unless there is a valid reason for absences , i.e a genuine illness , unforeseen emergency ( for example breakdown in care arrangements or household ) , it will be considered an unauthorised absence and may lead to disciplinary action being taken			1
' finally , it lists contact details for three companies providing interpreting services , as well as an out - of - hours contact for an organisation specialising in sign language and lip - reading for the deaf			0
the @entity15 issued the ten guidelines to ensure no - one was at risk of discrimination at their @entity12			1
employees are reminded : ‘ it is important to enjoy yourself , but the @entity15 ’s @entity123 should be observed			1
’ organisers should remember that not all staff celebrate @entity43 , so it is vital to make sure parties do n’t clash with other , @entity165 religious festivals			1
‘ there could be the potential for claims for sex discrimination			0
’ women with ‘ caring responsibilities ’ should not be excluded			0
nor should any staff currently on maternity or paternity leave			2
agency workers should also have access to the party			2
‘ if the venue is on licensed premises , there is the potential for age discrimination			0
think about how this difficulty could be overcome			0
if there is no age restriction on the venue , remind under 18 ’s they should not be drinking alcohol			1
‘ by choosing a venue that does not enable access , could potentially be cause for disability discrimination ( remember disability covers more than just physical access , toilets , etc )			0
disabled employees must not be treated less favourably than non-disabled employees			0
party planners must remember they have a ‘ duty of care ’ towards those who attend			2
make sure there are designated drivers and keep the number of a local taxi firm handy in case someone is too drunk to drive home			0
‘ absence from work following @entity43 parties / events — it is worth remembering , unless there is a valid reason for absences , i.e. a genuine illness , unforeseen emergency ( for example breakdown in care arrangements or household ) , it will be considered an unauthorised absence and may lead to disciplinary action being taken			0
should carry out a full assessment of possible risks before the party / event			2
this will serve to both reduce the risk of any accidents , and also assist in defending any claims should they happen			0
‘ you need to cater for the needs of everyone attending the event to avoid discrimination			2
consider the religious and cultural requirements and possible adjustments for disabled employees			0
