by @entity1 reporter anyone with kids tends to get a bit angry when a motorist is speeding through their neighborhood , and in some cases will take matters into their own hands in efforts to get the motorist to slow down			0
however , in most cases the speedster is n't driving a car that costs nearly a half - a - million dollars - and the method used to get the driver to slow down is n't to pelt the speeding vehicle with a rock			2
that , however , is exactly what happened to the driver of a @entity22 in @entity23 , @entity24 , who was driving a bit too fast for a bystander in what apparently is a residential area			0
enter what appears to be an older pedestrian , who apparently was not as impressed with the @entity53 's 700 horsepower as the driver of the car			1
' keep racing , ' the man taunts the driver as the vehicle came to a stop where the pedestrian was standing			0
' when the @entity22 tries to speed past him , the angry pedestrian hurls a rock at the side of the car , which appears to have done some significant damage based on the cracking ' thump ' heard on the video			1
mystery : neither the driver of the @entity22 or the rock - hurling pedestrian have been identified , even as the video has been viewed hundreds of thousands of times getaway : after throwing the rock at the @entity22 , the driver took off as the angry pedestrian chased after him the identity of the driver and the pedestrian is unknown - and attempts to get in touch with the man who posted the video to @entity45 were unsuccessful			1
finding the driver of the vehicle might be a little easier than tracking down the man who threw the rock - since @entity22 started making the @entity22 in 2011 , only about 2,500 of these ' supercars ' have been produced			2
for the driver 's sake , hopefully the vehicle 's exterior is n't as expensive to fix as the car 's price tag might suggest .			0

the @entity22 starts in price at about $ 400,000 , but can cost upwards of $ *600,000*
since @entity22 *debuted* the @entity22 in 2011 , only about 2,500 have been sold
the ' supercar ' has a 6.5 - litre engine and about 700 horsepower
the angry pedestrian warns the driver of the car to slow down before pelting it with a rock
the video has been viewed hundreds of thousands of times
