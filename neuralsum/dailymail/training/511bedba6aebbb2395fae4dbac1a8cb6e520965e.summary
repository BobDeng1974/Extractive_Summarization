last night 's episode attracts 8.2million viewers - @entity2 's highest ratings since @entity4 in 2008 it 's become the hit tv show that everyone is talking about as viewers marvel at the lavish and elaborate weddings and their traditional and old - fashioned culture			1
but one woman has slammed @entity12 and said it has tarnished the traveller community			1
@entity15 - not her real name - said the popular documentary show does n't portray traveller culture and has been an embarrassment for them			1
in order to speak out , she has insisted on being anonymous for fear of revenge attacks by families featured in the show			1
exaggerated : a traveller woman has spoken about @entity27 and said it did n't portray real traveller life ‘ it ’s mad , but just saying these things could get me killed			1
if i was identified i would have to go into hiding with my children			1
' disrespecting people in the community ends in big fistfights '			1
‘ you ’re not allowed to criticise another family			1
they would say , “ who are you to contradict me and my family ? ” ’ speaking to reveal magazine , @entity15 said when she heard about the programme , she was excited about a show about her community			1
but she now thinks the show has tainted their lives and she first noticed it was proving to be a problem when she tried to arrange her son 's first @entity50 and was turned away by the priest			1
insulting : ' @entity15 ' said @entity53 should not have worn that dress as it made travellers a laughing stock ' i thought it was good that people would be made aware of travellers			1
we suffer a lot of discrimination			2
' you 're always scared that the neighbours will find out who you are and the kids will get bullied			2
we ca n't even book wedding receptions under our real names			2
if the venue finds out , they cancel			2
' she said : ' millions have watched it , but all anyone is talking about are the dresses			2
we 're a laughing stock			2
' when @entity53 wore a big pink wedding dress on @entity78 , it was very insulting			2
you would n't dare laugh at an @entity82 woman in a sari			2
' forced : in last night 's episode , @entity84 and @entity85 go shopping for furniture for their house - but @entity15 said gypsies can no longer get pitches for their caravans @entity15 said she is not alone in thinking the show does n't portray the real travelling community			1
firstly , she said that no traveller chooses to live in a house - they are forced to			1
she said : ' travellers ca n't get onto the sites anymore and are forced to live in houses			2
there are n't enough pitches and councils refuse to make new ones			0
' and she said their dresses are nothing like the elaborate and expensive ones featured on the show			0
she said : ' you did n't get a big dress for @entity116 , it was a hand - me - down or borrowed			1
my wedding dress was big and white but not as big as the ones in the show			0
' ‘ lots of travellers phoned up the programme to say we are n’t like that			0
but it ’s too late			0
' they have n’t shown the weddings and communions where travellers wear normal dresses			0
naive : @entity15 believes that the parents of the young children who dressed and danced provocatively , did n't realise how it would come across exploited : @entity15 said they boys who exaggerated that they can drink from the age of 11 were probably exploited by the cameras ‘ even the show ’s name is wrong			0
most of the families on the show are @entity142 travellers , not gypsies			0
’ the full interview is in this week 's issue of @entity148 , out now she also said she thought a lot of the families featured on the show had been exploited , especially the parents of the young girls who dressed and danced provocatively			1
@entity15 added : ' those little girls have watched their older sisters dancing to @entity155			0
a lot of the party clothes have been copied from shows like @entity159			0
' i do n't think the families realised how it would come across			0
and i think some of the travellers exaggerated things , like the boy who claimed you can drink from the age of 11			0
' i bet he feels silly now			0
really , they 've all been exploited by the cameras			0
' @entity15 felt that she had to speak out about the show but protected her name for fear of reprisals from other traveller communities for speaking out			0
she said : ' it 's mad , but just saying these things could get me killed			1
if i were identified i would have to go into hiding with my children			0
