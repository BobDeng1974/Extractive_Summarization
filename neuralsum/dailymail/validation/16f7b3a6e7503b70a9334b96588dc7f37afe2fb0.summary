@entity1 director @entity0 said on thursday that two agents who allegedly ' crashed ' into a @entity4 barrier in early march while driving under the influence merely bumped into a barrel			1
' previous reports of a crash are inaccurate - there was no crash , ' @entity0 told a @entity12 subcommittee during testimony on the agency 's budget request			1
' the video shows the vehicle entering the @entity4 complex at a speed of approximately 1 to 2 mph , and pushing aside a plastic barrel			0
there was no damage to the vehicle			0
' @entity0 also told senators that the @entity1 was doing everything in its power to ' recreate ' surveillance footage from the night in question that had already been erased by the time he learned of the incident			1

@entity35 may never know whether two agents who crashed into a @entity4 barrier in early march were driving under the influence because it 's @entity1 policy to erase tapes after 72 hours , a congressman has revealed @entity41 chairman @entity40 , pictured here at a @entity43 hearing on tuesday , says lawmakers who were present for the @entity1 director 's explanation of why tapes were destroyed were stunned			1
' that does n't make any sense to us ' the newly minted @entity1 director 's testimony follows the chairman of the @entity41 's public disclosure on wednesday that it is @entity1 policy to delete footage of the @entity4 after 72 hours			1
@entity57 @entity56 @entity40 said @entity0 offered up the policy on tuesday at a closed - door meeting as an explanation for why he could only offer @entity35 video of the incident from two angles			1
' i do n't think anyone in that room could believe it , ' @entity64 told @entity69 wednesday			0
' that 's just a stunning revelation that 72 hours after they make a tape they destroy it ? that does n't make any sense to us			1
' on tuesday at a @entity4 hearing on his appropriations request @entity0 admitted that he did not know about the alleged drunk driving or crash , which interrupted a suspicious package investigation , until five days after it happened			1
' the fact that i did not learn of this allegation until five days after it is said to have occurred is unacceptable , ' he said today in his prepared remarks			0
the lapse in notification means that all evidence of a crime could have been destroyed before the time @entity0 says he was informed of his agents ' misconduct			2
' if it 's regular policy to destroy them after 72 hours , why did they have two of the tapes , and where are the rest of the tapes ? ' @entity40 had asked on wednesday			1
a spokesperson for the @entity1 did not return @entity105 's request for comment on the matter thursday morning			2
and the @entity4 's chief spokesman declined , when asked by @entity105 on thursday , to say whether he or the president felt it was ' appropriate ' for the @entity1 to delete surveillance footage with such frequency			1
the spokesman , @entity4 press secretary @entity112 , said he would withhold judgement until @entity0 had a chance to explain himself to @entity35 that afternoon			0
@entity0 later informed senators that @entity1 kept tapes related to the bomb sweep and that was how it still had video of the agents banging into the barrel			1
the @entity1 head allowed @entity35 to view one video on thursday but said he could not make it public ' because it may be evidence ' and a widespread release could ' taint future court hearings			2
' ' we understand it 's a concern , ' that additional tapes were wiped , @entity0 said , according to the @entity131 , and ' we 're doing everything we can to retrieve those images and to be as transparent as we can be			1
' @entity0 told lawmakers that the agency had contacted the manufacturer of the device it uses to monitor the @entity4 as well as forensics experts			2
the two agents involved in the march 4 episode were @entity141 , then the second - in - command on president @entity144 's protective detail , and @entity145 , a senior - level agent in the @entity147 field office			0
they were reportedly driving back in an agency vehicle from departing @entity1 spokesman @entity149 's going away party when they rolled through an area outside the @entity4 that was sectioned off by yellow security tape and hit a barricade			2
@entity40 told @entity69 that the videos he did see showed the agents coming just feet from hitting the suspected bomb , which turned out to be a non-threatening package			1
the footage did not show what happened afterward			0
' in terms of were they drunk or inebriated , ca n't tell , ' @entity40 said , because the tapes did not show the agents exiting the government vehicle or driving home after the incident			1
' we want to see other tapes to understand that , ' he said			0
if they even exist - and they may not , @entity40 acknowledged at the time			0
' at this hour we are calling on the @entity1 to provide those tapes so we can see a more full and complete picture			0
' @entity0 indicated on thursday that he was unsure whether the agents were drunk at the time of the accident			2
' i do not have the ability to simply terminate employees based solely on allegations of misconduct			0
this is not because i am being lenient , ' he said			0
' while i am extremely concerned by the allegations of misconduct and the potential for alcohol involvement , i must reserve judgment			0
' at the @entity4 hearing on tuesday @entity0 conceded that some @entity1 agents turn to alcohol to help them deal with the stress of their jobs			2
' we ’ve got to find a way to help some of these people that are going towards alcohol as a coping mechanism , ' he said			0
@entity1 director @entity0 testifies during a @entity198 hearing on the @entity1 budget on tuesday			1
@entity0 admitted at that hearing that he did not know about the alleged drunk driving or the crash , which interrupted a suspicious package investigation , until five days after it happened in addition to @entity35 , an an inspector general is conducting an independent review of the of the affair and whether a uniformed division supervisor ignored recommendations that officers undergo field sobriety tests			1
@entity141 and @entity213 have since been reassigned to desk jobs until the @entity216 review is concluded			0
@entity0 is a veteran of the @entity1 who president @entity144 pulled out of retirement to take over the @entity216 agency first on an interim basis and later in perpetuity after the former head of the security arm of the department resigned following a set of serious breaches of the president 's safety			1
the @entity4 said this week that the president was still ' absolutely ' certain that @entity0 was the right man to lead the agency , which has struggled to avoid scandal and operate efficiently throughout the second term of @entity144 's presidency			2
' this is very difficult work , and going in and reforming an agency like this will be challenging , ' @entity4 spokesman @entity112 said			0
' but somebody like @entity238 , who has the skills and the character to implement these kinds of changes , will be critical to the success of that agency			0
' and the president has complete confidence in @entity238 ’s ability to implement those changes in a way that will allow the agency to live up to the high standard that they ’ve set for themselves , but also to ensure that they ’re properly serving the country			0

he admitted the @entity1 destroys surveillance tapes every 72 hours
the agency is doing everything in its power to ' recreate ' footage from the night in question he said
@entity0 was not informed of the incident until five days after it happened , which is why he was unable to preserve videos from additional angles
