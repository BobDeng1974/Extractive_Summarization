fears : @entity2 boss @entity1 says youth unemployment has reached ' crisis ' levels in @entity6 a generation of @entity6 could be left on the scrapheap as one million young people are still out of work , official figures revealed today			1
the situation is at ' crisis point ' as one in five 16 to 25 - year - olds can not find a job and many have been looking for years , unions have said			1
at least half the one million unemployed youths have been searching for work for six months or more			1
and as youngsters collect their a-levels this week they are being warned their future job prospects look bleak in the toughest jobs market for 20 years			0
despite a slight fall of 4,000 youngsters dropping off the dole queue in the last three months , @entity2 general secretary @entity1 said : ' if this continues we could lose a generation of talented , highly qualified youngsters to blighted careers , debt and under - achievement			1
' students looking to start their careers or continue in their education next month are facing the toughest climate for nearly 20 years			0
' it 's particularly worrying that long - term joblessness for young people is still rising , even as overall unemployment falls			1
' the government 's economic strategy is holding young people back			2
it 's time for a new plan that invests in their futures , rather than stunting careers before they 've barely begun			0
' young people looking for a job or planning to continue in education are facing the toughest outlook since 1992 , he added			0
more than one in five people aged between 16 and 24 were out of work , significantly higher than in 1992 , when the rate was 16 per cent , he said			1
while the proportion of young people in full - time education has almost doubled from 24 per cent in 1992 to 41 per cent this year			2
but the government maintains that they are getting young people into work			2
tough : there are one million young people in the dole queue a spokesman for @entity70 @entity69 said : ' this is nothing but scaremongering from the unions at a very sensitive time			2
the last @entity76 government did all they could to manipulate youth unemployment figures and hide the real picture			1
' youth unemployment fell last month and there are fewer young people on @entity82 or any other temporary support now than there was in may 2010			1
this is still a big challenge and we do n't underestimate it for one moment			0
reply : work and pensions secretary @entity69 says that the @entity2 is ' scaremongering ' ' we are fully committed to helping young people get the skills and experience they need to get a job			1
over the next three years the @entity93 will offer nearly 500,000 opportunities for young people through work experience , apprenticeships and wage subsidies to help them find work			2
' a survey by the @entity100 showed that three out of four youngsters intending to go to university this autumn are worried about getting a job after they finish their course			0
the poll of 800 students also revealed that around two thirds had concerns about finances while they studied			0
@entity100 vice president @entity110 said : ' for many people , a university degree has traditionally given them the opportunity to access the employment of their choice			0
now those who make it to university are no longer guaranteed employment in the way that previous generations were			0
' unemployment amongst graduates is still lower than for those without a degree but those getting their a-level results this year face harder decisions than many about their futures			0
' @entity135 , director , youth charity @entity137 , added : ' there is an alarming number of unemployed young people who lack the skills and confidence they need to find work , and it is these young people that need urgent support			1
' overall unemployment fell by 65,000 between march and may to 2.58 million , although the number of people claiming jobseeker 's allowance in june increased by 6,100 to 1.6 million			1
but the drop has been mainly been put down to the @entity151			0
jobless rate : two year figures reveal a recent drop to 8 per cent unemployment @entity156 , chief economist at the @entity157 , said : ' the latest job market figures are encouraging , and act as a welcome contrast to recent pessimism about the @entity6 economy			2
employment is up , unemployment is down , and the rate of inactivity is at its lowest since 1991			0
' but there are still areas of concern			0
youth unemployment is unacceptably high , and too many people are still being forced to work part - time as they can not find a full - time job			1
while unemployment is likely to increase over the next 12 - 18 months , the peak may now be lower than the 2.9m figure we predicted in our last forecast			2

youth unemployment figures out today showed one million people aged 16 - 25 are out of work
