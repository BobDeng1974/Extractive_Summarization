armed with a sharp sense of smell , dogs have a long history of detecting explosives for their human handlers , and soon there could be sniffer elephants too			1
researchers have found that the large mammals excel at identifying explosives by smell , stirring speculation about whether their extraordinary ability could save lives			1
elephants could be used to detect land mines in areas that have seen conflict and could even do so at a distance with the aid of drones			1
researchers have found that elephants excel at identifying explosives by smell , stirring speculation about whether their extraordinary ability could save lives			1
a stock image is shown the research was conducted in @entity29 and involved the @entity31 military			1
on a game reserve co-owned by @entity34 , three elephants passed the smell tests			2
sniffing at buckets , they were rewarded with a treat of marula - a tasty fruit - when they showed that they recognised samples of @entity44 by raising a front leg			1
‘ they work it out very , very quickly , ’ he said			0
@entity49 , head scientist at the @entity50 , which backed the study financially , said that elephants remember their training longer than dogs			0
elephants could be used to detect land mines in areas that have seen conflict and could even do so at a distance with the aid of drones			1
this image shows an a warning sign in an area littered with explosives last summer , researchers confirmed that @entity29 elephants have the best sense of smell in the animal kingdom			1
scientists from the @entity72 said elephants have the largest number of genes dedicated to smell of any mammal			2
they have 2,000 genes that are dedicated to scent - twice as many as dogs and five times as many as humans			0
previous studies have shown that the animals have well - developed olfactory systems that include large olfactory bulbs and areas in the brain			2
they seem to be able to distinguish between two @entity90 ethnic groups — the @entity91 , who spear elephants to demonstrate strength , and the @entity95 , who pose little threat to the animals			2
the ability of elephants to detect explosives was first noticed in @entity103 - a country that many elephants had returned to after a 2002 peace deal ended a protracted war			2
while there was peace , the land remained sown with mine fields			0
some elephants seemed to intentionally avoid them , though it might not have been a scent that kept them away - they could instead have associated those areas with danger because elephants had died there in the past			2
researchers decided to investigate and in @entity126 , a town north of the @entity29 capital of @entity129 , elephants named @entity123 , @entity124 and @entity125 were administered smelling tests			2
the elephants detected @entity44 samples 73 out of the 74 times that they encountered in a line of buckets , according to @entity137 , a zoology student at the @entity138 in @entity139			1
they only got this wrong 3.6 per cent of the time over 502 buckets that contained the explosive , which was dissolved in acetone on filter paper			0
in an experiment conducted at a game reserve , elephants ( stock image ) sniffed at buckets some of which contained @entity44			1
they were rewarded with a treat of marula - a fruit - when they showed that they recognised samples of @entity44 by raising a front leg			2
the creatures have the best sense of smell in the animal kingdom all other buckets were filled with acetone and filter paper only			1
in a second set of tests , the elephants scored 100 percent , detecting @entity44 in 23 out of 23 buckets when ‘ distractor odours ’ such as tea , bleach , soap and gasoline were placed in the other buckets , she said			2
however , in the real world , making an elephant walk around a mine field would not only put the animal in danger , but would be impractical too			1
to overcome this problem , unmanned drones could collect scent samples from mined areas and bring them to a trained elephant , which would smell them and alert handlers to any sign of explosives , mr @entity34 said			1
the elephants detected @entity44 samples 73 out of the 74 times that they encountered its odour in a line of buckets , and could be used to sniff out landmines from a distance			1
here , a member of @entity201 's @entity200 uses a mine detecting dog to search for land mines another possibility would be to replicate an elephant ’s sense of smell and incorporate it into electronic sensors that detect dangerous materials , building on research with dogs and rats , mr @entity49 said			1
he revealed that researchers are thinking of designing a sensor based on an elephant trunk , which puffs out air to stir up an area , and then sucks in air to smell			0
@entity220 participated in the initial research , and it was done on a ‘ shoestring ’ budget with volunteers			0
the findings of the experiment did not surprise @entity227 , an assistant professor at @entity228 , who was not involved in the study			0
research last year revealed that elephants have the best sense of smell in the animal kingdom , partially because they have 2,000 genes that are dedicated to scent			1
‘ their world is primarily olfactory , ’ he professor @entity227 said			0
‘ the sensitivity is recognised as being unparalleled			0
’ the experiment comes as elephant populations across @entity29 are threatened			2
poachers across the continent have annually killed tens of thousands of elephants for their tusks in recent years because of a surge in demand for ivory in @entity248 , primarily @entity249			0
mine - detecting rats : @entity251 pouched rats are being used in @entity29 to locate landmines and help diagnose tuberculosis thanks to their acute sense of smell			1
some of the creatures are trained by the charity @entity259 and are used to detect explosives in @entity261 and @entity262 , which has many unexploded mines after decades of civil war			0
giant @entity29 pouched rats are being used in @entity29 to locate landmines and help diagnose tuberculosis thanks to their acute sense of smell ( pictured ) @entity271 bees : in 2013 , a team of scientists trained bees to sniff out explosives			1
the idea at the time was to house them in a hand detector , which could be used to sense a chemical in airports , for example			0
the bees were trained by exposing them to the scent that was detected while dangling a sugary drink in front of them			0
the insects , which stick out their tongues to get the sweet treat , quickly learned to associate the smell of the explosive or chemical with food			0
a trial was run at @entity292			0
' sniffer bees ' have also been reared to detect landmines in the @entity295			0
the bees , which @entity298 and @entity299 biologists say have an olfactory sense as good as dogs , will search out mines left by soldiers in the 1990s			0
nearly 120,000 of the unexploded devices remain in more than 9,400 carefully marked minefields .			0

research was conducted in @entity29 and involved the @entity31 military
experiment found elephants excel at identifying explosives by smell
animals were able to find @entity44 among buckets filled with distracting smells
skill could be used to find *buried* landmines in former areas of conflict
drones could collect mine field scent samples for elephant *analysis*
@entity329 's sense of smell could be used to inspire new sensors
