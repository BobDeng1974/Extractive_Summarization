a mother has a rare brain disorder which she claims causes her to take off her clothes in public – and says the condition is ' ruining her life '			1
@entity6 , 41 , has a small non-cancerous tumour lodged in her brain which triggers up to five seizures a day , each lasting up to half an hour			1
she blacks out during the fits - which have a strange and embarrassing side - effect - they often cause her to strip down to her underwear			0
they also sometimes leave her incontinent , meaning she is at risk of wetting herself publicly			1
mrs @entity6 says while the condition may seem amusing to onlookers , it is highly debilitating as she can not hold down a job and struggles to raise her two young children			1
@entity6 , 41 , has a small , non-cancerous tumour lodged in her brain which triggers up to five seizures a day			1
these episodes can cause her to strip off in public , she claims mrs @entity6 has a hypothalamic hamartoma , which is thought to affect only one in a million people			1
she says the condition is ' ruining her life ' as she hates having seizures in front of her children : @entity35 , 6 ( left ) and @entity36 , 9 ( right ) and feels as though she ca n't always look after them properly she relies on a carer to take her two children @entity36 , nine , and @entity35 , six , to school and is heavily dependent on her husband @entity41 , 43 , a shoe salesman			1
mrs @entity6 , of @entity42 , said she does n't strip every time she has a seizure , but it does happen around twice a month			1
she said : ' i have no idea what i 'm doing during the fits - it 's almost like i 'm sleep - walking and it 's led to some really embarrassing episodes			2
' once , i was shopping in @entity51 when i suffered a seizure and i began stripping in the aisles			0
when i came round , i was in nothing but my underwear			0
' she added : ' because i black out during the seizures i can never remember what happened - i simply come round with no clothes on			1
' i 'm sure it might look funny to some strangers but the condition is ruining my life			0
' the same thing happened at a taxi rank			0
' it 's mortifying and frankly i 'm amazed nobody has called the police to report me for indecent exposure			2
' mrs @entity6 has had seizures since she was four years old			1
medics were baffled by her condition until she was diagnosed with hypothalamic hamartoma at the age of 29			1
the condition is a small , non-cancerous brain tumour which causes seizures , blackouts and memory loss			1
it is thought to affect only one individual in every one million people			0
at 17 , she had surgery to remove part of her brain and rid her of the tumour			1
but the procedure , a left temporal lobectomy , only made the condition worse			2
now mrs @entity6 has five or more episodes a day			1
while some last for a few seconds , others can go on for half an hour			0
when she was 17 , mrs @entity94 had a part of her brain removed in order to remove the tumour			1
but the procedure , a left temporal lobectomy , only made the condition worse hypothalamic hamartoma ( @entity101 ) is a small , non-cancerous brain tumour which causes seizures , behavioural problems , blackouts and memory loss			1
the condition is thought to affect only one in a million people			0
@entity101 is often difficult to diagnose and even more difficult to treat			0
some individuals can go years with very few symptoms , or ones that are so mild , they are often missed by both parents and medical professionals			0
however , for most people with @entity101 , the most common symptoms are frequent daily ' gelastic ' seizures ( seizures which involve spontaneous laughing , giggling or smirking ) or ' dacrystic ' seizures ( which involve crying or grunting )			2
people with @entity101 report behavioural difficulties , and some have been diagnosed with attention deficit behavior ( @entity122 ) , autism spectrum disorder ( @entity125 ) , @entity127 ’s disorder , depression , paranoid disorder and obsessive - compulsive disorder			0
some have significant difficulties controlling angry outbursts , aggressive tendencies and many have been described as having oppositional - defiant disorder			0
these angry outbursts are often referred to as hypothalamic rages			2
what makes the actions different from a genuine angry ouburst is that the person typically does not make eye contact or the eyes seem vacant , they initially may not be able to hear any commands and they often require time and space to calm down			0
sometimes they have no memory of the rage once it is over			0
these symptoms often start early in life – for some , they become apparent shortly after birth , but are frequently misdiagnosed			0
they are most commonly treated by surgery or anti-epileptic medicine			2
