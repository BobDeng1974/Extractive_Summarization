@entity0 is in turmoil after it was revealed that two of the sport ’s biggest names had failed drugs tests			1
@entity6 , the fastest man in the world this year , has tested positive for an unidentified substance and former world record - holder @entity10 was among five @entity12 athletes to have failed drugs tests for a banned stimulant			1
@entity16 ’s agent @entity15 said that his client was not implicated in the scandal , but @entity20 relay gold medallist @entity19 confirmed she had tested positive for oxilofrine at @entity12 ’s national trials last month			1
if proved , the three quickest men over 100m this year will have failed drugs tests and will miss next month ’s @entity34 in @entity35 , leaving the sport in crisis			1
gay , 30 , the second fastest man of all time , has run the three quickest 100m times of 2013 , but tested positive for an unnamed substance at an out - of - competition test on may 16			1
the triple world champion will have his ‘ b ’ sample tested this week , but has already pulled out of the @entity46 ’s @entity34 team and friday ’s @entity48 meeting in @entity49			1
star men : gay ( left ) has recorded the fastest 100m this year and @entity10 ( right ) is a former world record holder gay said : ‘ i do n’t have a sabotage story			1
i put my trust in someone and was let down			2
‘ i do n’t have anything to say to make this seem like it was a mistake or it was on @entity61 ’s ( @entity61 ) hands , someone playing games			2
i do n’t have any of those stories			0
‘ i made a mistake			0
i know exactly what went on , but i ca n’t discuss it right now			0
i hope i am able to run again , but i will take whatever punishment i get like a man			0
’ you too : after the news of @entity6 's failed test , it emerged that @entity10 ( left ) also tested positive on a dark day for athletics , it emerged @entity10 was one of five @entity12 athletes to have failed tests			1
@entity10 , @entity19 and @entity28 are coached by @entity78 at the @entity79 and the two confirmed failed tests relate to banned stimulant oxilofrine			1
two athletes who compete in field events , including a junior , are also understood to be implicated			0
@entity10 and @entity19 both insisted they had not taken the drug intentionally , with sources suggesting it was part of a supplement introduced to their training group			1
but if their ‘ b ’ samples back up the findings of the ‘ a ’ samples , they will face two - year bans and may never run again			1
devastating : gay has admitting to using a banned substance @entity98 : the news is a true blow to those involved in athletics @entity10 , 30 , said : ‘ a sample i gave this year has returned “ adverse findings ”			1
the substance oxilofrine was found , which is considered by the authorities to be a banned stimulant			1
i have never knowingly or wilfully taken any supplements or substances that break any rules			0
‘ i am not now — nor have i ever been — a cheat			0
my team has launched an investigation and we are cooperating with relevant agencies and law enforcement authorities to discover how the substance got in my system			1
‘ this result has left me devastated			0
i am reeling from this genuinely surprising result			0
my fault , however , is not cheating but not being more vigilant			0
i want to reiterate that in my career as an athlete i have never sought to enhance my performance with any substance			2
’ pulling out : gay will take no part in the @entity131 next month after the findings a member of @entity10 ’s support team was reportedly detained by @entity136 law enforcement officers last night after a property in @entity136 was raided			1
it is believed the trainer provided the sprinter with supplements that could have contributed to the positive test			2
@entity19 , 28 , also took responsibility			1
‘ as an athlete , i know i am responsible for whatever goes into my body , ’ she said			0
‘ i would not intentionally take an illegal substance			2
i am sorry for any hurt or embarrassment this positive test may have caused			2
’ this is the biggest crisis to hit athletics since the @entity153 scandal at the turn of the century , when a number of @entity46 athletes , including @entity20 champion @entity157 , were found to be taking banned substances			2
@entity159 , a friend of gay and the world 200m champion , was suspended after a positive test for a banned masking agent in june			1
another one : @entity19 ( left ) has also tested positive for a banned substance former world 110m hurdles champion @entity165 said it was an ‘ absolutely awful ’ day for track and field , while @entity170 200m champion @entity169 called it a ‘ disappointing day for our sport ’			1
@entity165 added : ‘ gay is a global star			2
it takes away faith from the public			0
the good side is it does n’t matter what level you ’re at ; if you ’re taking drugs you will get caught			0
’ @entity182 , performance director of @entity0 , said : ‘ i would start with utter disappointment			0
you think of the athletes striving day by day and it must rip the backside out of them			0
’ the banned drug oxilofrine that top @entity12 sprinters @entity10 and @entity19 have tested positive for is a stimulant used to boost the body 's ability to burn fat			1
the substance helps athletes boost their power - to - weight ratio with more lean muscle and less fat , and so increase their speed			2
it may also increase the rate at which the heart reaches its maximum performance during exercise , meaning a greater supply of oxygen can get to the muscles earlier			0
@entity208 is an agent that stimulates part of the nervous system and was previously used to treat low blood pressure			0
more recently , it has started to appear in combination with caffeine in dietary supplements marketed as weight loss products			0
however , the superiority of using oxilofrine over an exercise warm - up to achieve this appears unconvincing			0
there have been no previous findings in @entity170 but competitors in cycling , athletics , weightlifting , rugby union and american football have been banned in the last three years			2
they include the @entity46 's @entity231 , one of the world 's top amputee runners , who received a six - month ban in 2011 and @entity46 cyclist @entity235 who was banned for 18 months in 2009			1
both said they had unknowingly ingested the stimulant via an over-the - counter supplement .			0

@entity6 admits *guilt* after testing positive for banned substance
@entity12 @entity10 and @entity19 also fail tests
gay ran fastest 100m time this year with 9.75s
@entity10 has clocked 9.88s but was not selected in @entity248 team to travel to @entity35 next month
