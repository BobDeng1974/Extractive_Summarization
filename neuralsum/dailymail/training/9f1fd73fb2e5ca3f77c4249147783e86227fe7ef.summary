by @entity1 reporter published : 14:31 est , 4 july 2012 updated : 05:42 est , 5 july 2012 @entity2 , 47 , who was given a life sentence at @entity4 today for the murder of 77 year old @entity6 a dangerous criminal who once dubbed himself ' your everyday psychopath ' has been jailed for life for bludgeoning a pensioner to death with a hammer			1
@entity2 struck @entity6 , 77 , at least 30 times after forcing his way into her flat in @entity18 , @entity19 , posing as a charity worker			1
@entity2 , who consistently denied murder during his trial at @entity4 , fled the scene with miss @entity6 ’s handbag , sparking a major manhunt before he was arrested in @entity26 , @entity27 , a fortnight later			1
he showed no emotion as the verdict was handed down by a 11 - 1 majority after the jury had deliberated for seven hours			2
ordering a minimum term of 35 years , judge mr @entity32 said the defendant clearly ' presents an extreme danger to women ' and may never be released from jail			1
he added that @entity2 ' has shown not the slightest regret or remorse ' after taking the life of ' an entirely decent , respectful member of the community			2
' that he will be detained until he is an old man is a price he must pay for committing such a terrible crime			0
' @entity2 , 48 , tricked the spinster into opening her front door by showing her @entity49 charity leaflets and immediately began battering her			2
her ground floor flat was ransacked and her jewellery stolen as she lay dying in her hallway			0
she was brutally beaten for a second time as the killer left			0
during the trial , which lasted almost three weeks , @entity58 , prosecuting , said the horrific attack was not random and that @entity2 had been following potential victims the day before			1
what the jury did not know is that @entity2 had already been convicted of locking a teenage girl in his car boot and raping her at gunpoint			1
during the seven - hour ordeal he told her : ' i am your everyday psychopath			1
' a few years later , he barged into a 23 - year - old woman ’s home , tied her up and sexually abused her			1
@entity2 , 48 , tricked the spinster ( pictured ) into opening her front door by showing her @entity49 charity leaflets and immediately began battering her he robbed that victim too , before going on the run , just as he did after murdering miss @entity6 , changing his appearance as he went			1
the court was shown @entity81 in @entity18 the day before the pensioner ’s death last august , which showed him talking to elderly residents			2
mr @entity85 said @entity2 was ' observing potential victims '			1
on the day of the murder , @entity2 went to miss @entity6 ’s home with the charity leaflets and a hammer he had stolen from a shop in @entity18			1
miss @entity6 , who lived with her terrier @entity92 , was settling down to her lunch of buttered toast			2
he struck her with the hammer straight after she answered the door and she fell against the wall of the lobby , bleeding from her initial head wound or wounds			2
@entity2 searched her bedroom for items to steal as she lay injured but still alive			2
she managed to crawl a few metres along the hallway before @entity2 struck again more than 30 times			1
he fled , taking a number of buses to different towns where he bought clothes and shaved his head			0
he arrived in @entity4 and threw her handbag in a bin before selling her jewellery for £ 300 at scrap value			0
a member of the public found her bag , alerted police and officers responding to a simple lost property case were met by a bloody scene			0
@entity2 was finally arrested after the case received national publicity			2
by then , his dna had been found on tissues at miss @entity6 ’s home			2
the tissues also had traces of her blood			0
@entity2 ’s fingerprints were also found on the charity leaflets			2
@entity2 denied the offence , claiming he took her handbag which had been left outside her home by the real killer			1
one of the most startling aspects of the case is @entity2 's background			0
a married former civil servant , those who knew him described him as well - educated , articulate and sociable			0
but his outward demeanour hid a terrible catalogue of depravities , including gunpoint rape , torture , kidnap , armed robbery and indecent assault			0
jurors were shown this hammer , a replica of the one used by @entity2 during his attack on @entity6 after he went on the run following @entity6 's murder last august , the police - who suspected he was responsible - warned the public that his air of normality made him deceptively dangerous			1
@entity2 had previously served long prison sentences for some of society ’s most serious crimes , but repeatedly convinced parole boards he was rehabilitated and fit for release			0
he was jailed for seven years for his attack on the 23 - year - old , but served just three before he was released in 1991 and married his long - term girlfriend , @entity162			1
but months later he went missing			0
on june 7 , 1992 , in an incident that bears striking similarities to the murder of @entity6 , he tricked his way the home of a young woman in @entity169 in @entity170			0
having compiled a ' robbery kit ' containing a knife , rope , tape and gloves , he bound and gagged the 23 - year - old and robbed and sexually assaulted her			1
the prime suspect , @entity2 went on the run only to be caught seven weeks later in the south coast seaside resort of @entity180 and jailed for 15 years			1
caught on camera : @entity2 is captured on @entity182 boarding a bus while on the run from police he was released after 10 , moving to @entity186 in 2002 where he slept rough			0
while on licence , he held a knife to a woman and stole her car , earning him another eight years behind bars in 2003			0
he was last freed in 2008 after serving just five years and went to live in @entity193 , @entity194 , before moving north to @entity195 in @entity196 , where police checked on him with monthly visits due to his history of offending			0
but he last spoke to his family on august 17 last year , then failed to appear at @entity202 ’ court to face a petty shoplifting charge on august 23			0
miss @entity6 was bludgeoned to death on august 19 in her flat , which was peppered with @entity2 ’s dna , prompting a major manhunt involving three northern police forces and 80 @entity211 officers across @entity212 were also put on alert and ports and airports were briefed			1
police hoped his fragile emotional attachment to his mother @entity218 , then 71 , would be the key to snaring the suspected killer			0
in a candid appeal , she told her son through the media : ' @entity2 , you need to hand yourself in at the nearest police station			1
it ’s the best thing you can do			0
you ’ve handed yourself in before and you can do it again			0
' @entity2 did not hand himself in but was arrested following a tip - off by library staff in another seaside resort - @entity26 in @entity27 - a fortnight after he bolted .			1

@entity2 , 47 , told he *'ll* serve at least 35 years for killing @entity6 , 77
