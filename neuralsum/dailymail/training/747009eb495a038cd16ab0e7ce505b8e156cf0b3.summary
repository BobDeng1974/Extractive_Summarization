diktat : the @entity1 said 20mph zones should only be introduced where there was clear public support for the limit road safety campaigners and motoring groups are at loggerheads over moves for a blanket imposition of 20mph zones in residential areas			1
campaigners urged the government to make 20mph zones ‘ the norm ’ in urban areas and villages - insisting their widespread roll - out has reached a ‘ tipping point ’			1
but the @entity1 said it was wrong to impose 20mph limits ‘ by diktat ’ and that the zones - which it broadly backs - should only be introduced where they carry clear public support			1
the row come as road safety group brake today takes its ‘ @entity36 ’ campaign to @entity30 and calls on ministers and mps to support the introduction of 20mph as the ‘ default ’ urban speed limit			2
brake has released new figures suggesting nearly eight out of ten ( 78 per cent ) of people think 20mph should be the ‘ default ’ limit around schools , in residential streets , villages , town and city centres			2
and just as many ( 81 per cent ) think traffic travels too fast on local roads , according to the poll by @entity51 and @entity52			1
but the @entity1 said it strongly opposed the idea of blanket imposition of 20mph zones without the consent and support of local residents			1
it supported lowering the limit from 30mph to 20mph where local residents backed the idea - including outside schools , colleges and hospitals			2
and the @entity1 ’s own poll findings showed that nearly 7 out of ten ( 68 per cent ) were strongly in favour of local consultation before such lower limits were brought in			1
of that , some 31per cent were strongly in favour of consultation and 37per cent ‘ somewhat ’ in favour			0
by contrast , only 1 in 20 ( 5 per cent ) of those polled backed imposing 20mph limits regardless of the feelings of local residents , said the @entity1			2
brake has released new figures suggesting nearly eight out of ten ( 78 per cent ) of people think 20mph should be the ' default ' limit around schools , in residential streets , villages , town and city centres @entity1 president @entity86 said : ‘ the message is loud and clear - residents want to be asked first before the speed limit is changed on their streets			1
it does n’t mean they will say no to a 20mph speed limit , it means they want a say rather than being issued with a decree that ignores local democracy			2
’ the @entity1 added : ‘ we ’d very concerned about it being imposed on arterial roads such as bus routes which could slow down the pace of a town or city			0
’ @entity51 said that areas where 20mph limits have been introduced have seen casualty rates fall , with @entity106 recording a 22per cent dip in casualties and @entity109 in north @entity110 seeing crashes reduce by more than half ( 54 per cent )			0
other areas where 20mph limits have been imposed include the @entity114 , @entity115 , @entity116 and @entity117			0
slow : it is estimated that 12.5 million people in the @entity120 now living in areas which already have or are implementing 20mph limits it argues that with an estimated 12.5 million people in the @entity120 now living in areas which already have or are implementing 20mph limits , the @entity120 is at a ‘ tipping point ’ at which it would make ‘ social and economic sense ’ to have 20mph limits as the ‘ norm ’ in residential areas			0
brake deputy chief executive @entity132 said : ‘ the go 20 campaign is about defending everyone ’s right to walk and cycle freely without being endangered , whether it ’s to get to work , school , the shops , or just getting out and being active			0
‘ we need to tackle the senseless and violent casualties that continue to happen daily on our roads , and we need to enable people to live healthy , active , social lives			0
it ’s clear that 20mph limits in communities can help bring this about - and it ’s clear this is what people want			0
’ a @entity153 spokesman said : ‘ setting speed limits on local roads is a matter for local authorities but this government has published new guidance to make it easier for councils to introduce 20mph zones			1
research shows that cutting 20mph limits on certain roads can save lives and we must do all we can to prevent road casualties			0

campaigners have urged @entity170 to make 20mph limit ' the norm '
@entity1 said it was wrong to impose zones by ' diktat ' and need public support
more than eight in ten believe traffic travels too fast on local roads
