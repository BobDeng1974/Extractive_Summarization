by @entity1 reporter from the @entity4 to the @entity5 , our favourite soaps are supposed to reflect the people who live there			2
but actually , if the characters of @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 or @entity13 had to pay real - life prices for the homes they live in they would be homeless , according to statistics revealed yesterday			1
the @entity17 came to its conclusion after comparing property prices in @entity4 , @entity20 , the @entity21 and @entity22 to the characters ’ average salaries as listed by the @entity25			1
fantasy land : the cast of @entity10 appear to live happily on their modest salaries and pay the mortgage a spokesman said the characters ’ modest wages would n’t even cover the cost of rent , never mind a mortgage			0
@entity37 of the @entity17 said : ‘ without more affordable homes across the country , people on modest incomes will continue to face the real - life drama of being unable to put down roots			0
’ the figures were revealed in the wake of chancellor @entity46 announcing he wants the @entity47 to ‘ intervene ’ to cap mortgages handed out to homebuyers to avoid a property bubble			0
as far as residents of @entity10 are concerned the average house price in the ‘ @entity4 ’ is £ 355,000 , according to the @entity17			1
in @entity55 - the square in @entity56 which was the model for @entity10 ’ @entity53 - a three - bed home with two bathrooms is worth around £ 1m and the average price for a house in the square is £ 662,565			1
real life : prices in @entity56 , east @entity4 , are soaring with houses on the model for @entity53 worth £ 1m whether in the @entity4 or @entity69 , most of the characters in the @entity68 soap would n’t have a hope of buying a house in the area - or even renting , as average rents are around £ 1,250 a month			1
according to the @entity25 ( @entity25 ) , a marker trader like @entity75 or @entity76 would earn around £ 20,500 a year			0
most mortgage lenders offer house buyers four times their salary , meaning @entity75 and @entity76 could only afford a home worth £ 82,000 , and would struggle to pay rent of £ 1,264 a month			2
car lot boss @entity82 , likely to pull in around £ 26,000 , and laundry manager @entity83 - on around £ 16,000 - would also struggle to afford to buy in the @entity4			0
the same goes for most of the cast , including restaurant boss @entity85 - on around £ 40,000 - with the only one who could possibly afford to buy a house in the area being grease monkey and businessman @entity90 with his dodgy deals .			0

@entity17 compared characters ' salaries to home costs
same applies to @entity21 in @entity11 and @entity22 in @entity13
average house price in the @entity4 of @entity4 is now £ 355,000
