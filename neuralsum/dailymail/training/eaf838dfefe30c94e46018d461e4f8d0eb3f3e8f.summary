by @entity0 published : 17:24 est , 30 april 2013 updated : 01:50 est , 1 may 2013 the influx of migrants from @entity4 and @entity5 will be ‘ nothing like ’ the levels seen when @entity8 joined the @entity9 , the prime minister said yesterday			1
campaigning in @entity11 ahead of tomorrow ’s local elections , mr @entity10 said the huge numbers coming from @entity8 since it joined the @entity9 in 2004 – put at 1.1million – was due to @entity15 putting no controls on immigration while other countries did			1
he said : ‘ when a country joins the @entity9 you can put in place transitional controls			2
you can say to that country , ‘ you ca n’t all come here for the first seven years ’			0
calming words : the @entity15 will not have ' another @entity8 situation , ' @entity10 , seen speaking in @entity27 , @entity11 , said regarding the possible influx of migrants from new @entity9 nations ‘ the last government , when @entity8 and a lot of other countries joined did n’t put those controls in place			1
‘ and because other @entity38 countries did we did have an enormous influx of people from @entity8 and those other countries			1
‘ this time because the transitional controls have been put in , we are not lifting the restrictions on @entity5 and @entity4 alone , it ’s happening right across @entity38			1
' so i do n’t think we ’ll have anything like the situation we had in the @entity8 situation			1
’ mr @entity10 and home secretary @entity47 have been criticised by @entity48 for failing to comment on the issue and what the impact may be on the health service and welfare system			2
restrictions : the prime minister @entity10 , pictured during the @entity57 's speech at a @entity58 for the president of the @entity60 today , said the restrictions would apply across @entity38 the prime minister yesterday said the immigration system was ‘ one of the messes we inherited from the last government ’ who ‘ did n’t know who was coming in to the country and who was going out			1
’ he said the numbers were ‘ out of control ’ with net migration - the difference between the number of people moving to @entity15 and those leaving - as high as 200,000 per year			2
‘ over ten years , that ’s two million extra people coming to live in @entity15			2
that ’s like two cities the size of @entity82 , that ’s the problem we inherited			0
we ’ve got that number down by a third , that ’s progress but i want us to go further			0
‘ if people want to come and work , just as if @entity15 people want to go and live and work in @entity92 or elsewhere that ’s one thing			2
‘ but what we ca n’t have is a situation where people choose to come and live in a different country because the benefits are generous or because there ’s a better chance of getting a council house			2
‘ you ca n’t have that sort of benefit tourism and we ’ll be taking action on that front			0
’ crossing borders : the lack of restrictions on new @entity9 member states under the last government has resulted in 1.1million @entity8 coming in to the @entity15 since it joined the @entity9 in 2004 mr @entity10 said the problem needed to be tackled across government			1
he said : ‘ you ’ve got the immigration minister thinking about immigration , but actually you need the health minister to be thinking about it , the @entity120 minister , the legal affairs minister because having a tough approach on immigration should be across all those things			0
‘ you should n’t have instant access to the @entity126 , instant access to housing , instant access to benefits , so we ’re sorting all those things out so that people who do come here will be people who want to come and work and make a contribution just as you ’d be welcome if you wanted to do that in another @entity38 country			0
’ in a @entity142 debate last week , @entity140 mp @entity139 said the public had a right to expect ‘ some kind of sensible estimate ’ of numbers of @entity5 and @entity4 migrants from ministers			1
the mp for @entity151 said if it was the same proportion as from @entity8 - 1.1million out of a population of 73million since 2004 , there would be 425,000 arriving from @entity4 and @entity5 whose combined population is 28million			1
@entity156 put it at around 50,000 a year , which also works out as 400,000 over eight years			0
even @entity158 , chairman of the @entity159 , who was @entity160 under @entity161 when mass immigration was underway , has urged the @entity163 to learn from his mistakes			0
he said : ‘ with the benefit of hindsight i hope the mistakes that were made , and there were mistakes made because research ought to have been commissioned			0
‘ i hope ministers will learn from mistakes made by people like myself and others			0
i hope that proper research is commissioned and that is something the government has categorically refused to do			0

@entity10 promised restrictions on migrants from new @entity9 members
@entity184 said there will not be a ' @entity8 situation ' with @entity4 and @entity5
1.1million people have arrived from @entity8 since it joined @entity9 in 2004
