by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 03:07 est , 18 april 2012 updated : 01:44 est , 19 april 2012 television history was made yesterday as cameras were allowed into court to film the moment a murderer was sentenced to life in prison			1
it was the first time that cameras had recorded the sentencing of a killer in a @entity14 court			2
but the cameraman was not permitted to film murderer @entity16 himself , who was convicted last month of killing his ex-lover @entity17			1
scroll down to watch the televised sentencing days from death : the @entity21 image shows @entity17 shopping with murderer @entity16 in 2010			1
within 48 hours she had died at his hand instead , the footage focused solely on the judge , @entity24 , as he handed @entity16 a mandatory life sentence			2
a single television camera , set up in the empty jury box , recorded his statement			0
at the @entity29 in @entity30 he told @entity16 , whose victim ’s body has not been found : ‘ it seems that you are the only person who knows where her body is			1
‘ i hope that a day will come in your life when you will feel able to disclose that information and that might bring some comfort to her bereft family			0
’ the historic move to allow the recording was the result of a successful application by @entity49 broadcaster @entity47 , which argued it would be in the public interest			0
legal history : @entity16 's sentencing at the @entity29 in @entity30 today was the first to be televised in @entity14			1
the defendant was not allowed to be filmed marker : there are plans for more cases from @entity14 courtrooms to be televised filming is currently banned in criminal court hearings in @entity62 and @entity63 , though this ban is expected to be lifted later this year following an announcement in the @entity66 in may			0
hearings at @entity69 ’s @entity68 , the @entity14 ’s highest court , are already broadcast live and cameras have been allowed in @entity49 courts since 1992			2
but their presence has been very rare – restricted to a few high - profile appeal court cases , including that of @entity77 bomber @entity76 in 2002			0
before yesterday ’s sentencing , the court had heard that @entity80 , 38 , a respected and well - liked book - keeper from @entity30 , ‘ just disappeared ’ after making her way to the city centre office she shared with @entity16 on may 4 , 2010			1
guilty : @entity16 ( left ) was last month convicted of murdering his former lover @entity80 ( right ) @entity84 , 49 , confronted her before she reached her desk about her decision to end their relationship , then snapped and killed her			1
the ‘ deceitful and controlling ’ killer maintained a front of normality , then drove her body to a secret grave , believed to be in remote @entity95			0
@entity24 told @entity16 : ‘ the evidence indicated that , having confronted her over her decision to end the relationship , you lost your temper and murdered her in a sustained attack			0
’ unable to grieve properly : miss @entity17 's parents , @entity103 and @entity104 ( above ) , arrive at court for sentencing this morning			1
they have pleaded with @entity16 to reveal where their daughter 's body is buried the judge added : ‘ the evidence showed that after murdering @entity17 , you immediately embarked on an elaborate plan to dispose of her body and avoid detection			1
with quite chilling calmness and calculation , you successfully disposed of the body , apparently somewhere in @entity95			0
’ @entity16 , who maintains his innocence , showed no emotion as he was led away amid angry shouts from the packed courtroom			0
miss @entity17 ’s parents , @entity103 and @entity120 , who attended court , said that although they were comforted to know justice had been done , they would not be able to rest completely until they knew where their ‘ devoted ’ daughter was			0
