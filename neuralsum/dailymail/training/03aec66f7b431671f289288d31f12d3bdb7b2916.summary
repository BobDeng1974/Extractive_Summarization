the parents of a 5 - month - old were shocked when police showed up to take away their infant boy after they told a doctor they wanted a second opinion			1
caught on camera , the footage shows police entering the @entity9 home of @entity10 and @entity11 and asking @entity10 to hand over the baby			1
‘ i ’m going to grab your baby , ’ one of the several officers at the scene told @entity11 , ‘ and do n’t resist and do n’t fight me			2
’ surprise : @entity10 and @entity11 wanted a second opinion after doctors at a @entity23 hospital made them too nervous to leave son @entity24 ( pictured ) in their care ‘ he grabbed my arm , ’ the new mother told @entity28 , ‘ so i could n't take @entity24			1
and they took @entity24 , and they just walked away			2
" the saga began about two weeks ago when @entity24 , who suffers from a heart murmur , began showing flu - like symptoms			2
the @entity34 took him to @entity35 in @entity23 , @entity9 , the hospital where @entity24 had been receiving regular treatment for his heart condition			1
according to @entity10 , the couple became alarmed after a nurse came in to give the baby antibiotics			2
uncomfortable : @entity42 ( left , with @entity11 ) says the hospital made mistakes and they just were n't comfortable when doctors started discussing heart surgery ‘ i asked her , “ for what is that ? ” and she 's like , “ i do n't know			1
” ' how , @entity10 wondered , was the woman working as a nurse but unaware of the purpose of a medication ? @entity10 said a doctor would later tell her @entity24 did not need antibiotics			1
while still at @entity57 , @entity24 was admitted to the pediatric @entity58 for observation			2
within a few days , doctors began discussing the possibility of heart surgery for the baby			1
motivated by fear , @entity10 took @entity24 from the hospital without a proper discharge and admitted him to another hospital , @entity67			1
taken : though they got ok 'd from a different hospital to take @entity24 home , police let themselves in the next day and took @entity24 into protective services @entity73 : @entity10 , left , said @entity74 told her @entity24 was taken due to the @entity11 's ' severe neglect ' and @entity11 , right , said he met police at the door and they threw him to the ground before entering the home and taking @entity24 ‘ i do n't want to have my baby have surgery in the hospital where i do n't feel safe , ’ @entity10 explained			1
police then showed up at the second hospital			2
‘ they told us that @entity57 was telling them so much bad stuff that they thought that this baby is dying on our arms , ’ @entity10 said			1
at @entity67 , the doctor indicated on the infant 's records that he was clinically safe to go home with the @entity34 and that there was no concern for the @entity24 ’s safety in their care			1
on april 24 , the police arrived at their house			0
@entity11 said he greeted them and was pushed to the ground when he asked if he was being arrested			2
they then took @entity24 away			0
extreme : @entity10 said the doctors at @entity35 ( pictured ) in @entity23 , @entity9 had police convinced she and her husband were bad parents differing : while one hospital suggested surgery , another , @entity67 ( pictured ) ok 'd @entity24 to go home with his parents according to @entity10 , a child protective services worker told her @entity24 was taken away for ‘ severe neglect ’ but did not elaborate on the neglect			1
@entity28 reached out to @entity119 and were told to contact child protective services			0
reporters were told by @entity74 that they could n't comment on individual cases			0
@entity74 spokesperson @entity123 told the @entity125 affiliate , ' we conduct a risk assessment of the child 's safety and rely heavily on the direction of health care providers			0
' the @entity34 were allowed an hour of visitation with @entity24 on thursday			0
an outraged @entity11 told @entity28			0
‘ it seems like parents have no right whatsoever			0
’ ‘ we did everything , ’ a tearful @entity10 agreed			0
‘ we went from one hospital to another			0
we just wanted to be safe , that he is in good hands			0
’ a court date hearing was set for april 29			0
uncertain : @entity24 remains in the care of authorities , with his fate to be determined april 29			0

@entity10 and @entity11 had a bad experience at a @entity23 , @entity9 hospital so they took son @entity24 to another area doctor
though the first hospital was discussing heart surgery , the second ok 'd the family to head home
that 's where police showed up the next day and *wrenched* @entity24 from @entity10 's arms
