by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 23:31 est , 11 september 2013 updated : 06:09 est , 13 september 2013 @entity3 is following its budget rivals by charging passengers to check in their baggage on short - haul flights			1
the airline announced a £ 10 fee to put luggage in the hold on some of its routes from @entity13 and @entity14			2
it will come into effect later this month on flights to @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25			0
budget : @entity3 passengers will soon be able to fly from @entity13 and @entity29 airports on a ' no - frills ' hand - luggage only ticket @entity3 said it is making short - haul flights cheaper for those who do not want to fly with hold luggage , but denied that it had been forced to change its fares structure to compete with budget airlines			1
‘ we are basically offering the fare to adapt to travellers ’ requirements and to give them what they want , ’ said a spokesman			0
the charge follows a trial over the summer on short - haul routes from @entity48 , where @entity3 faces strong competition from @entity50			1
many airlines now impose add - on charges for services including baggage , food , seat reservations , priority boarding , fast - track security or seats with more legroom			0
these now comprise up to 5 per cent of airlines ’ total income , compared with less than 1 per cent five years ago			0
saving time and money : not only will passengers save themselves £ 10 , but they might also avoid the queue to check larger items of luggage into the hold @entity70 - @entity69 , @entity3 head of short haul , said : ‘ the hand - baggage - only fare at @entity48 has proved popular with customers , so we ’re now introducing it on a selected number of short - haul routes from @entity13 and @entity14			1
‘ if it proves as successful , we plan to roll it out across the whole short - haul network in the coming months			1
’ @entity50 charges between £ 9 and £ 19 for bags checked into the hold			2
bags weighing more than 20kg cost customers flying with @entity85 £ 25			0
if they do chose to take a bag to be checked in at the airport after having booked a hand - luggage only ticket , passengers will pay an additional £ 40 to stow their case			0
competition : the move will see @entity3 rival cheaper alternative carriers such as @entity50 the move will not affect long - haul flights , where @entity3 faces strong competition from airlines offering larger baggage allowances			1
aviation consultant @entity100 said @entity3 needs to show that its no - baggage fares are competitive with low - cost carriers			0
ironically , @entity103 - based @entity50 appeared to move in the opposite direction to @entity3 last week by launching an ' inclusive fare ' that includes seat assignment and a checked in bag in the price .			2
