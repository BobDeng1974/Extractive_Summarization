an enterprising mother has ensured her children and their classmates can enjoy a nutritious hot school lunch after their canteen closed by becoming the new school cook			1
children at @entity7 in @entity8 , near @entity9 , @entity10 , had been reluctant to eat the hot meals on offer and the canteen kitchen was eventually closed			1
for 18 months all 202 pupils at the school had to make do with packed lunches everyday - and like many parents @entity18 , 41 , found it hard to come up with healthy lunchboxes @entity18 ( pictured centre ) with pupils at @entity23 who now enjoy her nutritious school meals she felt her children @entity25 , eight , and @entity27 , six , would benefit from a decent hot meal during their school day			1

@entity18 has enlisted the help of other parents at the school to help her serve lunch and come up with simply , good - quality meal ideas for the children ms @entity18 , who has enlisted the help of other parents at the school to help her serve lunch , says she wants to show that it is not rocket science - children just want simple , good quality food			1

the spaghetti bolognaise is a recipe my mum used and we also follow recipes we 've found online from @entity83 or @entity84			0

' ms @entity94 , who used to work as a waitress at the @entity97 restaurant in @entity98 before taking on various desk jobs , said moments like that have made her new role hugely satisfying			0
she said : ' i do n't want to sound trite but it 's so nice to feel as though you 're putting something back into the community			0
' we knew we wanted our children to have hot meals but we did n't want any old catering firm coming in and doing it			1
' i just thought - let 's go for it and do it ourselves ' living in @entity8 , she says says many parents are willing to pay the Â£ 2.30 it costs for each meal because they trust her as a fellow villager and playground mum			2
now , in the 12 months her catering firm @entity121 has been up and running , she has had the chance to learn all the children 's names and their dietry requirements , plus if they like a bit of extra gravy now and then			1
@entity128 and classmate @entity129 , both seven , said their school dinners were a real hit			1
' they 're amazing - we all really love them , ' said @entity128			0
' they 're so good , ' said @entity129 , ' about the same as my mum makes at home			2
' the government 's free school meals policy , which means every child aged five to seven is entitled to a hot lunch , has put pressure on catering staff across the country to come up with healthy , balanced menus headteacher @entity147 , like many of her staff , regularly joins the children for lunch to take advantage of the local ingredients and home - cooked style			1

' before , when everyone had packed lunch , the atmosphere was rather like a picnic - it just was n't right			2
' now the children look forward to their meal , they talk about their meal - they just love their dinners ! ' mother @entity197 said that was certainly true for her children @entity200 , seven and @entity201 , four			1
' my two love their lunches , ' she said			2
' i am also happier , knowing they get a hot and healthy meal for lunch			1
' they seem to have more energy now at the end of the day			0
