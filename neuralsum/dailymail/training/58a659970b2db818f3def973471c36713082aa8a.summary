@entity0 has banned controversial airport ' strip - search ' scanners over fears the x-ray technology could cause cancer			1
experts have found the body scanners emit low doses of radiation and the @entity11 has told member states not to install them until the risks are assessed			1
they will be completely banned in april if experts rule they are dangerous			2
millions of people worldwide are believed to have passed through the security scanners			1
in the @entity18 passengers are required to do so if asked			2
controversial : a demonstration of the scanners that @entity0 bosses have failed to give the green light for			2
a full body scan is shown , left , and a screen showing the results of the scan , right @entity28 use : more than 600 @entity30 units , using x-ray technology , have been installed at 140 airports across the @entity28 @entity33 , the only airport in the @entity18 which now has the scanners , installed 16 of the £ 80,000 machines , and has been told it can continue using them for another year			1
however , no new machines will be allowed at the moment to ' protect citizens ' health and safety '			2
the scanners were introduced in a security crackdown after incidents such as the attempted ' underwear bomb ' terror plot in 2009			2
they were used at @entity48 but scrapped amid complaints about invasion of privacy			0
they have also been tested in @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity56			0
research suggests that because of the large number of scanners in the @entity28 - there are 250 - up to 100 passengers a year could get cancer			1
@entity18 , which argues the scans are a ' proportionate response to a very real terrorist threat ' , could be hit with a fine from the @entity0 courts if it ignores the ban			2
in july , hospital consultant @entity69 told how he was grounded after he refused to go through a ' naked ' x-ray scanner at @entity33 , claiming it could give him cancer			1
he was not allowed to board the plane to @entity74 and was escorted out of the airport by police			0
various @entity78 groups have also protested against the scanners and some @entity81 scholars have forbidden @entity78 travellers to pass through full body scanners on the grounds that they violate religious laws			1
last year two @entity78 women who refused to be scanned on religious grounds were barred from a flight to @entity89			2
last november technology blog @entity90 revealed 100 images showing visitors to a @entity95 courthouse standing inside a scanner machine as it took their photograph - with their intimate body parts clearly visible			0
@entity90 applied under the @entity100 and put a selection online , taking care to mask the identities of all involved			0
a female passenger also claimed she was made to feel like a terrorist for bringing breast milk she had pumped earlier through security at @entity109 airport			0
@entity110 had 12 ounces of breast milk with her and as per @entity113 guidelines , she requested the milk not be passed through the x-ray scanner because of possible radiation			1
and last month , a @entity113 agent faced dismissal after finding a sex toy in woman 's bag and leaving her a note saying : ' get your freak on girl '			0
the @entity126 said : ' the radiation dose from an examination of two or three scans is less than that received from two minutes flying at cruising altitude			2
' at @entity33 passengers selected for scanning are banned from flying if they refuse to pass through the device			1
the airport says around 10 passengers have been unable to board their flight after refusing tp pass through the scanners , known as ' back scatter ' machines			1
a spokesperson for the airport said : ' extensive tests by the @entity18 @entity126 and the @entity28 health authorities have already confirmed that back scatter body scanners pose a negligible risk to human health			1
' it is irresponsible to suggest that because @entity0 has yet to complete its own health study , our passengers should be concerned			2
' @entity0 legislation issued this week has approved millimetre wave , another form of body scanner technology , for permanent use at airports			0
' while its study is underway , an extension of the trial of back scatter body scanners at @entity33 has been approved by the @entity161 until november 2012			1
' given that all of the relevant authorities support the use of back scatter body scanners , the trial will continue			0
' the @entity11 has ruled that for the time being , only security scanners which do not use x-ray technology are approved for use			1
the use of any scanner is only allowed if they do not store , retain , copy , print or retrieve images			0
vice-president @entity177 , the @entity11 commissioner responsible for transport , defended the ban , saying : ' security scanners are not a panacea but they do offer a real possibility to reinforce passenger security			1
' security scanners are a valuable alternative to existing screening methods and are very efficient in detecting both metallic and non-metallic objects			0
' it is still for each member state or airport to decide whether or not to deploy security scanners , but these new rules ensure that where this new technology is used it will be covered by @entity11 wide standards on detection capability as well as strict safeguards to protect health and fundamental rights			1
' experience to date shows that passengers and staff generally see security scanners as a convenient method of screening			1
' the first x-ray body scanner was developed in 1992 by @entity209			0
he sold the technology and rights to @entity212 , which now manufactures and distributes the device			0
fears about the health risks were raised in the @entity28 as far back as 1998 when the machine known as the @entity217 was evaluated by a panel of radiation safety experts brought together by the @entity220			1
they all expressed concerns about the machine because it violated a longstanding principle that humans should not be x-rayed unless there is a medical purpose			0
the machine ’s inventor told panellists that the machine would most probably not be widely used for many years to come			1
@entity231 in @entity231 was the first airport to implement the scanners in 2007			0
in the @entity28 the @entity113 scanners sparked a heated debate over security concerns versus travellers ' privacy when they were first brought in autumn 2010			1
the machines have also been installed in some courtrooms			0
in response , @entity241 's legislature issued a resolution urging @entity244 to review the programme			0
study group @entity246 then filed a lawsuit to suspend the use of scanners at @entity28 airports pending an independent review			1
in february 2011 , a trial of new ' non-intrusive ' body scanners started at @entity255 , @entity256 , and @entity257 before they were rolled out permanently in july			0
@entity260 's @entity259 followed in september , where more than eight million passengers boarded planes last year			2
also in september , @entity264 , which owns @entity48 , said it will test the new ' privacy - friendly ' scanner			0
the @entity54 government had planned to install full body scanners at all airports and train stations but removed them from airports , calling them ' slow and ineffective ' .			0

@entity11 introduces ban while danger of x-ray machines is fully assessed
radiation experts first *warned* of the risks 13 years *ago*
millions of passengers forced to pass through scanners worldwide
@entity33 told it can use its 16 scanners for another year
cancer risk *highest* in the @entity28 where there are 250 machines
