by @entity0 published : 06:31 est , 5 march 2013 updated : 04:55 est , 6 march 2013 holiday company @entity1 has had to delay operating @entity3 's troubled new ultra-green @entity3 plane from may for at least two months			1
the aircraft - the @entity3 - has been beset with operational difficulties , including an issue with on - board batteries catching fire mid-air			0
@entity10 had been hoping to start flying the new quiet , fuel - efficient plane from may , but they will now not be able to do so until at least july			1
the £ 10 supplement paid to them by holidaymakers for their 787 flights will now be refunded			1
delay : after a @entity3 , like this @entity3 , made an emergency landing in @entity18 , holiday company @entity1 has announced it has delayed using them until at least july disappointment : @entity10 say that @entity3 have not told them when their new 787s will arrive so have had to delay its may roll - out already years late due to production difficulties , the much - heralded @entity3 finally entered service with @entity18 carrier @entity25 in october 2011			1
but a series of battery fires have affected flights of late , with various national aviation authorities ordering the grounding of the planes			0
@entity1 , which is due to receive eight @entity32 , is the @entity34 launch customer for the plane and was busy promoting trips on the 787 which can seat between 210 and 290 passengers on medium - range routes			1
but the company today said ' in the absence of a delivery schedule from @entity3 ' , it had decided to switch customers booked on the @entity3 in may and june to alternative planes			1
' our dedicated customer service team is in the process of contacting all customers impacted to inform them that they will now be travelling on @entity10 ( @entity3 ) 767 long - haul aircraft , which have premium cabins , ' a spokesman said			1
' the supplement paid for the @entity3 flight will be refunded to those customers who proceed with their original holiday bookings , and customers will also have the option to amend their holiday without incurring any amendment fees			1
' we understand how frustrating and disappointing this news will be for those customers looking forward to flying on the @entity3			2
' we are equally as disappointed that @entity3 was not able to confirm a delivery date for us but unfortunately these circumstances are out of our control			0
' emergency : charred batteries taken from the @entity25 787 , left , and the @entity3 parked at @entity67 's @entity66 , right @entity10 's parent company , @entity68 , had ordered 13 of the @entity32 , of which @entity10 had been allocated eight			1
the airline originally hoped it would receive the first four 787s some time before may 2013 , with the other four arriving by may 2015			0
flying from @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 and @entity73 , the first @entity32 were due to operate to @entity74 in @entity75 and @entity76 in @entity77 , with the first flight on may 1			0
@entity10 said it could not comment on just how many passengers had been affected by the @entity3 delay due to ' commercial sensitivities '			1
in one of several scares , a battery overheated on a @entity3 flight in @entity18 and forced the plane to make an emergency landing because it was incorrectly wired			0
the @entity25 ( @entity25 ) @entity3 touched down in @entity89 when the lithium ion battery sparked an on - board fire , prompting the worldwide grounding of the @entity3 jets due to safety concerns			0
@entity18 's @entity95 has said the battery for the aircraft 's auxiliary power unit was improperly connected to the main battery , which overheated during the flight			0
the incident on january 16 came days after a battery exploded on a @entity3 parked at @entity67 's @entity66			0
a mechanic conducting a routine post-flight inspection on the @entity3 jet discovered smoke in the cockpit			0
passengers had disembarked the plane just 15 minutes before the blaze broke out			0
in december @entity3 said @entity112 regulators had ordered the entire fleet of 787 jets to be inspected for a possible fuel line problem			0
@entity117 flight 1146 from @entity118 to @entity119 was diverted to @entity120 on tuesday for an unspecified mechanical problem - one month to the day of the @entity3 's historic launch on november 4			0
the mechanical issues , while not necessarily uncommon , were yet another headache for @entity3 , a company still working to overcome the negative perception of production problems that delayed delivery of the 787 by 3 - 1/2 years			0
@entity129 is due to receive the first of 24 @entity32 in may while @entity131 is scheduled to get the first of its 16 @entity32 in september 2014			1
@entity129 said today that it had not received any notification from @entity134 - based @entity3 of a delay to the delivery of its first @entity32 , with a total of four due to be delivered this year			1
@entity129 added that the 787s would be replacement aircraft so that if there was a delay in delivery the existing aircraft ( @entity141 ) would carry on operating			2
@entity131 said it was still working towards its scheduled september 2014 delivery date			2
grand designs : @entity3 had hoped the @entity3 would revolutionise air travel though it has failed to get off the ground @entity149 's the limit ! the first class cabin features larger windows , special lighting and filtered air throughout the plane welcome aboard ! an upgraded video screen on the back of a seat shows off the menu screen to some of its entertainment features that passengers are desperate to use themselves there was better news for @entity129 today as the airline was able to announce that tickets were on sale for its first flight using the superjumbo @entity171 - the world 's largest passenger plane			1
@entity129 's first superjumbo flight will be from @entity175 to @entity176 on october 15 , with @entity175 - @entity178 services using the @entity171 starting on november 15			2
the superjumbo , which first entered service with @entity181 in october 2007 , is capable of carrying well over 500 passengers , but @entity129 's configuration will see the double - decker plane carrying 469 travellers			2
start - up fares to @entity176 begin at £ 499 return , with @entity178 prices from £ 559 @entity189 has ordered 12 superjumbos with deliveries taking place from now until 2016 , including three this year .			2

holiday company ordered them for may , but wo *n't* get them until at least july
@entity10 beat @entity129 and @entity131 to be the first @entity34 airline to use them
they charged customers £ 10 extra to book , but will now offer refunds
