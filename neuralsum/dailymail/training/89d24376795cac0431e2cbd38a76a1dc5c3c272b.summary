by @entity0 for the @entity1 follow @ @ @entity2 @entity3 crashed out of the @entity4 in a shock second round defeat by @entity7			1
four errors at the back from @entity11 's makeshift defensive line - up resulted in four goals , two each taken with aplomb by @entity14 and @entity15 , as the @entity17 side enjoyed a superb evening at stadium : mk			1
here , @entity19 's @entity0 gives his verdict on the performance of the players			0
@entity32 6.5 - put in a decent shift and was always on hand to tidy up , although hardly relied upon			0
clean sheet : @entity7 keeper @entity36 celebrates his side 's opening goal @entity39 7 - there to make the important blocks once @entity3 started to attack later in the game			1
@entity43 7 - showed more determination than any of @entity3 's players on tuesday night			1
@entity47 6.5 - a strong display in the @entity7 back - line , and good enough to trend on @entity49 ... holding off : @entity7 @entity50 keeps @entity3 's @entity51 at a controlled distance @entity53 7.5 - tipped to be a thorn in @entity3 's side , and showed plenty of spark throughout			1
@entity59 7.5 - a key player who enjoyed his night in the @entity7 engine room against weak opposition			1
@entity62 6.5 - looked decent enough before being substituted with half an hour to play			0
@entity64 8 - @entity7 ' star man who created attacks , set up goals and was a constant threat			2
@entity68 to see his second - half shot not earn a penalty for handball before going off			0
@entity74 on - loan striker 's impressive brace was what got @entity7 en route to their emphatic win			2
final flourish : @entity7 striker @entity15 slots home the first of his brace @entity81 united 3 - 5 - 2 @entity82 6 - conceded four goals against @entity17 opposition and was frustrated with defence			1
@entity88 5 - @entity87 's best defender but the youngster should n't be too proud of that			0
@entity92 4.5 - at fault for the opening goal , lucky to not concede a penalty and was n't captain material			0
lack of leadership : @entity92 took the @entity3 captain 's arm band for the @entity4 match taken on : @entity101 defender @entity100 moves right in a bid to beat @entity7 ' @entity32 @entity104 5 - a spark here and there but nothing that truly worried @entity7 down the left flank			1
@entity51 5 - substituted at half time on his @entity3 debut and had a tough night at the back			2
@entity111 5 - wanted to impress but failed to do so , and did n't give his best audition for @entity113			0
@entity115 @entity114 to be forced off with mild concussion and blurred vision after 20 minutes			0
@entity119 's best player who tried his best in attack but was substituted an hour in			0
before the rot : @entity115 may consider himself fortunate to have left the field with the score at 0 - 0 @entity100 5 - not the best performance from the youngster who struggled on the left for @entity3			1
@entity128 - ever threatening up top and did very little to make his mark in front of goal			0
@entity133 6 - had his chances but is unlikely to have convinced @entity113 he 's worthy of a place			2
chance : @entity138 striker @entity137 got a rare start alongside @entity133 at @entity140 @entity141 joins @entity144 's @entity143 exodus it 's not too late to play @entity146 … there 's £ 1,000 to be won every week by the highest scoring manager			2

@entity64 the stand - out player for @entity7 as @entity17 side beat @entity3 4 - 0 at stadium : mk on tuesday night
@entity137 and @entity133 failed to put in a convincing display
@entity157 frustrated between the sticks as defence make *costly* errors
