i ’m starting to think @entity1 might actually become a better version of @entity3			1
he ’s certainly got all the qualities that make him the perfect replacement for the @entity7 captain			1
i appreciate that @entity8 is set to take over as skipper , but in terms of dynamism , energy and quality , @entity1 looks like the perfect replacement for @entity3 the player			1
have a look at sunday ’s victory over @entity18 : @entity1 started the game as one of two @entity21 behind @entity22 ( @entity24 ’ innovative approach as a coach should not be underestimated )			1
when @entity26 went off , @entity1 went over to the right wing , and then when @entity28 was substituted , @entity1 ended the game on the left wing			2
@entity1 ( centre ) gave an all - action display as @entity7 impressively beat @entity18 @entity1 chats with @entity7 captain @entity3 during training on monday he is truly two - footed – for that reason alone @entity35 football should treasure him			1
but he is also clearly capable of playing in different positions , and he can adapt midway through a game			0
those qualities are not readily available in most players and it takes me back to the @entity44 final of 2005 when @entity3 ended up at right back			2
the very best not only play different positions , they excel in those positions as well			0
@entity1 still has to prove he can do it , as @entity3 did , in a major final , but he proved it in a massive game on sunday			1
a simple five - minute chat about @entity1 with @entity24 will have him purring			1
the @entity7 manager will be using words and phrases like ' balance ' , ' clever ' , ' worker ' , ' technical ability ' , ' awareness ' , ' great character ' , ' looks after the ball '			2
bring up the subject of @entity1 and you could be there all day with @entity24			2
on sunday all the talk was of @entity64 , and understandably so			0
the brilliance of his goals alone in recent weeks makes him the hot topic and it ’s great to see him add consistency to the undoubted quality			0
but @entity1 ’s contribution should not go unnoticed			2
@entity64 ( 2nd right ) curled home @entity7 's winner late on in the @entity79 clash at @entity80 vice-captain @entity8 ( right , front ) also scored a screamer for the @entity83 on sunday one thing you might not know about @entity1 is that in @entity24 ’ words , he is ' no shrinking violet '			1
he has bags of personality and character off the pitch as well as on it , and good leadership qualities – let ’s not forget he was captain of @entity95 as they returned to re-establish themselves in the @entity79			0
for @entity7 ’s system he is perfect			2
he has quality on the ball – did you see his @entity103 turn in the centre circle against @entity18 ? breathtaking stuff – he creates – he scores ( probably could score more ) – and he presses the ball			0
he was injured pre-season , so it was a slow start to his @entity7 career and some supporters were too quick to judge			0
@entity24 knew that opponents ’ approach to @entity7 would be different this season , he knew he would need players to be clever on the ball , and @entity1 has that football intelligence			1
@entity1 - who played three positions against @entity18 - shows his defensive qualities challenging @entity119 he does n’t get talked about too much , does he ? is that because he ’s @entity35 ? probably			1
but @entity24 told me this about @entity1 : ' he ’s technically as good as any @entity123 player '			0
some might disagree , but it rams home the point that we do n’t value his qualities highly enough in this country			0
in the feverish pace of the @entity79 , @entity1 still makes time for himself on the ball , and has that football intelligence and ability to make an impact on a game			0
yet somehow , if he is only on the bench for @entity137 later this month it wo n’t be a surprise			0
and that ’s a shame in my opinion			0
@entity3 ’s departure will still hurt @entity7 fans , but i expect @entity1 to grow even more when the legend leaves			1
he ’s one of the most underrated footballers in the @entity79			0
@entity1 slides in to have an effort on the @entity18 goal that went narrowly wide of the target			1

@entity7 beat champions @entity18 2 - 1 on sunday
@entity137 *midfielder* @entity1 excelled in three different positions
@entity7 captain @entity3 is leaving the club at end of the season
@entity1 looks the perfect replacement for @entity3
read : @entity8 *confident* @entity7 can finish above @entity18
