' we were doing a ceremony by the pool and there was no moon that night but he bride said she wanted one , ' remembers a chuckling @entity10			2
happy couple : newlyweds enjoy their first official kiss as they release a box of doves supplied by @entity10 bizarre : unusual requests have included a champagne swimming pool and a bulldog best man ( pictured ) in charge : @entity10 , or ' @entity80 ' as he 's known , with his right hand men outside @entity44 ' so we had to provide the bride and groom with a moon , which we did by contacting a hot air balloon company and hiring a balloon , which we then used to light up the pool			1
' we put it between the @entity91 's two towers and roped it in place			2
the bride and groom were very pleased			0

' he pauses and adds : ' i â€™m very good at convincing people i can handle such situations			0
' balloon moons notwithstanding , what most @entity11 brides and grooms want , says @entity10 , is a personal affair - even if that means travelling huge distances and moving heaven and earth to get what they want			1

' we had to fly there just to pick up these @entity150			0
' other expensive requests focus on food			2
' the other day , one bride asked us to get in those @entity157 crabs , those big crabs which we then had to cook according to a special recipe			0
