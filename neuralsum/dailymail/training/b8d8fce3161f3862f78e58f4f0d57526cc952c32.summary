a gypsy couple who have been ordered to demolish their £ 250,000 ' mobile home ' because it is 18 inches too wide have opened the doors of the static unit they have lived in for the last eight years			1
@entity7 and partner @entity8 moved onto the land in @entity10 , @entity11 in 2006 - despite local planning laws which ban building on the site			1
in 2011 - after an appeal - they were eventually granted permission to have two mobile homes which they knocked into a single property , complete with conservatory , three bedrooms , two bathrooms , a living room and dining area			1

council chiefs have said the two mobile units joined together were too big at 24ft wide , instead of the maximum 22ft 3ins permitted under rules governing caravan sites although their home in set in its own two acres of land , back from the main road , the council has told @entity7 that he will have to demolish the excess 18 inches from its dimensions now the couple are either faced with a huge bill for the work , or will be forced to tear down their home , which they have spent years making comfortable for their retirement but they found themselves in another battle with @entity49 when it emerged their lavishly appointed double park home - which also has a front garden and an ornamental pond - was too big and did n't adhere to planning proposals for ' mobile homes '			1
although their home in set in its own two acres of land , back from the main road , the council has told mr @entity7 that he will have to demolish the excess 18 inches from its dimensions			1
now the couple are either faced with a huge bill for the work , or tearing down their home , which they have spent years making comfortable for their retirement			2
it comes after planners said the two mobile units joined together were 24ft wide instead of the maximum 22ft 3ins permitted under rules governing caravan sites			2
mr @entity7 , who worked as a labourer for his whole life , yesterday said he and his partner have been left devastated by the decision			2
he said : ' they just want me to cut the front of my house clean off			0
in 2011 , after an appeal , they were eventually granted permission to have two mobile homes which they knocked into a single property , complete with conservatory but they found themselves in another battle with @entity49 when it emerged their lavishly appointed double park home was too big and did n't adhere to the planning proposal mr @entity7 and partner @entity8 moved onto the land in @entity10 , @entity11 in 2006 and ignored a local ban to build on the site [ capti the home has three bedrooms , two bathrooms , a living room and dining area in 2006 , the council refused to accept that the mobile unit was a ' caravan ' because it did not pass the necessary mobility tests the family home - which has been fully furnished - has been the couple 's home for eight years mr @entity7 said : '' i bought this place to stay here but it is a situation where i have tried everything and i have tried to compromise ' ' i have worked since i was eight because i believe you have to look after yourself			1
i saved all my life to buy this place			0
' i had decided first of all to cut it down myself but it is going to cost me £ 38,000 and i 've already spent £ 30,000 on legal costs			0
i ca n't afford it			0
' at the moment we 're at a stage where they could come at any time because they have enforced the enforcement			0
' my mp has never come across anything like this before , neither had the judge and neither has my barrister			0
' if your face fits then it goes through , but if your face does n't fit then it wo n't			0
floor plans for the property show it has a kitchen , lounge three bedrooms , and two bathrooms			1
but now planners have said the two mobile units joined together were 24ft wide instead of the maximum 22ft 3ins permitted under rules governing caravan sites ' i am sat in two acres of land , i have got no immediate neighbours and i have got conifer trees all around it			1
' it will look exactly the same if we cut the front off			0
' the battle to keep his home has been a long one for mr @entity7			2
in 2006 , the council refused to accept that the mobile unit was a ' caravan ' because it did not pass the necessary mobility tests			1
council chiefs also did no believe that mr @entity7 was a gypsy at the beginning of the planning process - so the planning decision was not assessed in accordance with those used for gypsy sites			1
however , after hearing additional information about his formerly ' nomadic life ' - which he lived until he decided to settle down and cease travelling - they accepted his status and gave permission for him to build a ' mobile home for persons of gypsy status '			1
mr @entity7 , and his partner , 75 , were refused permission to keep the existing home on the site as the council voted for ' direct action ' to remove it in 2012			1
the couple appealed but a high court judge has now lifted an injunction stopping the council from getting rid of the property under the original enforcement notice of 2006			2
council chiefs also did no believe that mr @entity7 was a gypsy at the beginning of the planning process - so the planning decision was not assessed in accordance with those used for gypsy sites a report to a recent planning committee meeting said : ' implementation and execution of direct action to comply with part of the enforcement notice , the removal of the unauthorised park home , will now be carried out to remedy the ongoing breach of planning control			1
' mr @entity7 said the threat of demolition is taking its toll on he and his partner 's life			2
he said : ' my missus is crying all the time and her blood pressure is through the roof because we do n't know what day they will just turn up			0
' we do n't have the amount of money we need to cut it down			0
all i want is to retire here in peace			0
' i bought this place to stay here but it is a situation where i have tried everything and i have tried to compromise			0
' if they give me enough time then i could try and sort something out to cut it down			0
' if they were to move this and get rid of it then it would cost them £ 40,000 and they would have to find me accommodation			0
' they just sit in their offices and they are just not bothered			0
' a spokesman for the council said : ' as the judge has now discharged the injunction , which was in place pending the latest planning appeal to be dismissed , the @entity49 can now implement direct action to rectify the longstanding breach of planning control			2

@entity7 and @entity8 moved onto land in @entity10 , @entity11 in 2006 , but ignored planning laws
eventually granted permission for two static homes to be knocked through for persons of ' gypsy status '
now council says home , which has pond and garden , is 18 inches too wide to be considered a mobile unit
floor plans show the property *boastt* three bedrooms , two bathrooms , a kitchen , lounge and conservatory
