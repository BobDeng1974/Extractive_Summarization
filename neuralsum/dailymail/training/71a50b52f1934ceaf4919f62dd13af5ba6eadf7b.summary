we have all said things that we ’ve immediately and eternally regretted			0
for @entity3 it ’s a thoughtless , inexplicable quip made when he was 14 and had just been told his mother had died			1
‘ what will we do without her money ? ’ the teenage @entity3 blurted , not knowing how to handle his shock and grief			1
words of wisdom : @entity3 , left , with his mother @entity12 and brother @entity13 during a family trip to @entity15 then he went to bed and cried all night , clasping his hands in prayer , promising @entity19 he would be good if only his mother could come back			1
so , it comes as little surprise to learn this week that @entity3 , now 70 , has told a @entity24 fan that if he had a time machine he would like to ‘ go back and spend time with my mum ’			1
to lose a mother at any age inevitably leaves a well of regret			2
to lose her at 14 can be devastating , and it ’s quite possible the death of @entity35 in 1956 from an embolism after an operation for breast cancer , affected @entity3 ’s life for ever			1
his brother @entity13 , who was then aged 12 , would later say how , just after their mother ’s death , @entity3 ’s growing interest in the guitar turned into an obsession			1
eight months later , in the summer of 1957 , @entity3 was to meet @entity47 , who was also soon to lose his mother in a road accident			1
@entity3 believes their shared sense of loss helped bond them , cementing their early friendship			1
decades ago , when i was at a @entity57 recording session at @entity59 ’s @entity58 , @entity3 took me into an empty studio , sat at a piano and played me a song he was writing			1
it sounded to me like a hymn and , though at that point , he did n’t have many lyrics , one phrase he repeatedly sang that night stayed in my head for more than a year until the record was released			0
it was : ‘ @entity70 comes to me , speaking words of wisdom			0
’ bereaved : @entity3 told a @entity24 fan this week that he would see his mother if he had a time machine the song , of course , was @entity77			1
@entity3 would later say it came about as a result of a dream he ’d had in 1968 , when , though @entity57 were at the height of their fame and creativity , fissures had begun appearing in the camaraderie of the band			1
@entity47 had recently become attached to @entity87 , and the future looked uncertain for @entity57 , which devastated @entity3			1
suddenly , in the middle of the turmoil , he found himself dreaming about his mother			2
‘ there was her face , completely clear , particularly her eyes , ’ he would recall			0
‘ and she said to me very gently , very reassuringly : “ let it be			0
” ‘ it was lovely			0
i woke up with a great feeling			0
it was really as if she ’d visited me at this very difficult moment in my life and had given me this message : “ be gentle , do n’t fight things , just try and go with the flow and it will work out			0
” ’ we are all products of our upbringings — @entity3 no less than anyone else			1
so what kind of parents did he have , and what was she like , the mother who , at 47 , died so young and so suddenly ? like many of their generation , @entity117 and @entity35 were , when they married in 1941 , already in their 30s , an aspirant lower - middle - class couple in the largely working - class city of @entity116			1
@entity117 , who worked as a firefighter during the blitz , was a cotton salesman , and @entity12 was a midwife			0
in fact , having been in charge of the maternity ward at @entity127 , @entity116 , she was awarded the privilege of giving birth to @entity3 in a private ward			1
her ambition for her elder son was that he would become a doctor			0
@entity135 , a lovely man , had a little jazz band before he married , so there was music in the family			0
though the cotton industry was to go into decline after the war , meaning @entity117 never earned much , his wife ’s wages and ambition saw the family eventually move to a pleasant estate in the green @entity116 suburb of @entity149			0
from there , @entity3 and @entity13 passed the 11 - plus to go to the best grammar school in @entity116 , the institute			1
@entity3 was clever and always industrious , but he admits he could be a handful , too			1
family portrait : @entity13 ( left ) , mother @entity12 , father @entity117 and @entity3 ( right ) when @entity12 would correct his strong @entity116 brogue , he would imitate her deliberately posher accent , and then be upset when she was , understandably , hurt			1
and when , one washing day , she found a cartoon of a naked woman he ’d drawn to amuse the boys at school in his shirt pocket , she sternly demanded an explanation			0
he was mortified with shame			0
by the mid-fifties , the @entity164 were doing well and , for @entity12 , life must have seemed splendid , until in 1956 she began to complain of pains in her chest			2
she put it down to the menopause , and her gp agreed			0
but then the pains got worse , and when 12 - year - old @entity172 came home from school and found her crying , she went to see a specialist			0
breast cancer was diagnosed and she was told she would need an immediate operation to remove the tumour			2
despite instructions to rest , the day before she went into hospital she cleaned the house and washed and pressed her sons ’ clothes			0
she wanted , she told her sister , to leave everything ready , ‘ in case i do n’t come back ’			1
the following day , @entity3 and @entity13 went to see their mother after the operation			1
there was blood on the white sheets			0
‘ it was terrible , ’ @entity3 would remember			1
@entity12 ’s condition quickly deteriorated and just an hour after they left , she received the last rites			0
her strength ebbing away , she turned to her sister and said : ‘ i would have liked to see the boys growing up			0
seeing him crying was the worst thing for @entity3			1
‘ you expect to see women crying			0
but when it ’s your dad , it shakes your faith in everything , ’ he said			0
somehow @entity117 struggled on , caring for his teenage sons			0
@entity12 and @entity117 had wanted @entity3 to go to university , but soon music filled his world			2
as with all those who lose a parent when young , thoughts of his mother never left @entity3			1
nine years after her death he would , without the help of any of the other @entity57 , write and record his most famous song , yesterday			2
loves of his life : @entity3 with first wife @entity220 , right , and on his wedding day to wife @entity222 , left once again it was a melody that came to him in , he believes , a dream			2
the lyrics , however , might be telling			0
‘ i said something wrong , now i long for yesterday , ’ he sings			2
was that a veiled reference to the words he wished he ’d never said on hearing the news of his mother ’s death ? on that night in 1968 , when he played me @entity77 for the first time , my impromptu private audience was cut short when a young , fair - haired @entity236 woman in a raincoat turned up at the studio along with her small daughter			1
her name was @entity220 , and she and @entity3 were to marry , in the face of much opposition from the group ’s fans , a few months later			2
‘ it was as if my mum had sent me her , ’ he would say			0
from all the traumas and trials of @entity57 relationship break - ups , theirs was to become a spectacularly happy marriage , with @entity220 a rock at his side , helping create the close family life that had been cut short in his teenage years			0
their first daughter was named @entity12 , after his mother , and when , following the birth of @entity261 , a son was born , he was called @entity262 , after @entity3 ’s father			1
for 30 years @entity3 and @entity220 were inseparable , so when she was diagnosed with breast cancer in the early nineties it must have seemed that a terrible blight of history was repeating itself			2
tribute : two of @entity3 's most famous songs , @entity77 and yesterday , were about his mother by that time , @entity3 was vastly rich , but still managing to live as normal a family life as possible for a man who had once been a @entity57 and who still toured the world			1
@entity220 was the centre of the family , and when she died in 1998 @entity3 was , for a long time , inconsolable			1
no doubt his grief for @entity220 brought back the loss of his mother			2
for @entity3 to wish he could go back in time and get to know his own mother better is entirely in character for a man whose childhood was , in many ways , cut short by her early death			1
youth is inevitably a selfish time , and it ’s only as we get older that we begin to see the world from the perspective of those who ’ve gone before us and to understand the struggles they made on our behalf			2
by sending her sons to a prestigious grammar , @entity12 was helping endow @entity3 with ambition			2
she did n’t live to see how he used it , but one suspects she ’d have been proud when , with his backing , that school was refounded as the @entity303			0
@entity47 , @entity304 , @entity305 and many others helped make @entity3 the man he became , but @entity117 and @entity35 shaped him first			2
