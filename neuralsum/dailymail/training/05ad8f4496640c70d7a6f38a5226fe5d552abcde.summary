@entity1 power forward @entity0 made a powerful statement during his team 's visit to the @entity5 on monday when he showed up to the presidential home without a tie			1
the 38 - year - old @entity9 veteran plainly stood out among teammates -- all of whom wore neckties -- as they lined up behind the commander - in - chief			2
so does @entity0 despise authority or dislike the president himself ? probably neither			1
if a 2005 quote is any indication , @entity0 simply hates dress codes			1
@entity20 deigned to shake hands with @entity1 power forward @entity0 despite the @entity9 veteran 's refusal to wear a tie to their meeting monday when the @entity9 instituted a dress code for its players that year , @entity0 told reporters exactly how he felt about it , the @entity28 points out			1
' i think it 's a load of crap			2
i understand what they 're trying to do with hats and ' do rags and [ retro ] jerseys and stuff			2
but i do n't understand why they would take it to this level			0
i think it 's basically retarded , ' he said			0
he 's also been noted by both @entity48 for his anti-fashion ways			0
despite his refusal to dress in line with tradition , @entity0 was named specifically by the president as he welcomed the @entity9 champion @entity1 to the @entity5 on monday			1
despite the demands of his @entity58 fandom , however , the president admitted the @entity1 were ' hard to dislike			1
' ' first of all , they 're old , ' he said of the squad led by 38 - year - old @entity0			1
' for an old guy , it makes me feel good to see -- where 's @entity0 ? @entity0 's got some gray			1
there 's a few others with a little sprinkles around here			0
there 's a reason why the uniform is black and silver			0
' @entity20 even specifically named the 38 - year - old @entity0 as he congratulated the team on for being @entity9 champs @entity0 was the only spur not wearing a tie at the @entity5 , where most people choose to wear ties fellow @entity1 player @entity79 told @entity28 sportswriter @entity80 he did n't even try to coax the fashion - hating ( nearly ) 7 - footer to wear a tie as a father of two daughters , one of whom plays basketball , @entity20 praised the @entity1 as the first @entity9 team to hire a woman assistant coach , and welcomed the wealth of international talent the team has brought to the league			1
' it 's the @entity97 of basketball teams , ' he said of a squad that features @entity102 players @entity100 and @entity103 along with @entity104 's @entity79			0
@entity105 , @entity106 , @entity107 and @entity108 are also represented on their roster			0
' they find folks who did n't have a chance someplace else and suddenly they figure out a way to make them shine as part of a team			0
in that sense , they 're a great metaphor for what @entity119 should be all about , ' said @entity20 , who was presented with a @entity1 jersey with ' @entity122 ' written over its number one			1
the keen basketball fan also offered some serious analysis of the @entity1 ' style and its influence on the league , and praise for their bounce back from a crushing @entity9 finals loss to @entity133 in 2013 , to beat the @entity133 in 2014			2
but he could n't resist poking some fun at notoriously taciturn coach @entity135			0
' i want the coach to know that he is not contractually obligated to take questions after the first quarter of my remarks , ' @entity20 said			2
@entity0 has long been known as an anti-fashion type			2
he also hates dress codes			0
in 2005 , he called the then - new @entity9 dress code ' a load of crap '			0

president @entity20 *invited* the national champion @entity1 to @entity147 on monday and only @entity0 showed up without a tie
