@entity0 has questioned whether his continued absence from the @entity3 team was a personal snub by manager @entity5 , as he looks to revive his career under @entity7 at @entity8			1
at 30 , @entity0 says he still feels ‘ as fresh as a daisy ’ and is targeting promotion to the @entity10 with his new club			1

‘ i spoke to @entity5 and he told me my chance was coming			1
he told me my attitude was first - class			2
then the games came along and i was n’t playing			0
‘ for whatever reason , he ’s not used me — even though the team struggled to score , i ’ve still not played			0
is it deeper than what people say ? it might be , who knows ? ’ @entity0 is set to make his @entity8 debut at @entity36 today , his first club , in a key clash between second and third in the @entity40			1
it will be the first time he has returned to @entity42 as a player since leaving for @entity44 in 2005			0

@entity0 revealed his exasperation at missing out even when @entity77 was absent through injury and suspension			2
@entity0 is all smiles after penning a loan deal at @entity8 until the end of the season ‘ i played in pre-season and did well , i had chats with numerous people and i thought i would play			1
for some reason i did n’t , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ @entity88 had done his injury and was out — and i still did n’t play ! i do n’t know what sort of option that made me			0
if @entity88 was fit , i was on the bench			0
if he was n’t , i was on the bench			0
’ @entity0 eventually compelled @entity5 to allow an emergency loan move to @entity97			1
‘ i do n’t know any player with ambition who wants to sit there , week in week out , and not play , ’ he said			0

featuring at @entity36 would bring his career full circle			0
@entity0 burst on to the scene in @entity118 as a 17 - year - old in 2001			1
‘ they are the best days of your life when you ’re in the youth team and parents are standing on the side wondering , “ is he going to come through ? ”			0
it ’s a club i ’ll always hold in high regard			0
i ’d like to think i ’d get a good reception			0
’ at his peak , @entity0 could claim to be one of the top @entity10 strikers			1
back in 2011 , he was behind only @entity134 and @entity135 for scoring over the previous six years			0
