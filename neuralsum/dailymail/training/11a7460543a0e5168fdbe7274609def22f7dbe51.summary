by @entity0 in @entity1 published : 12:46 est , 13 may 2013 updated : 15:26 est , 13 may 2013 ' it is clear the @entity3 can not operate with even a shred of the @entity6 people Â¿ s confidence under the current leadership , ' @entity7 wrote to treasury secretary @entity10 @entity11 @entity7 senator @entity7 demanded the resignation of acting @entity3 commissioner @entity13 on monday , as president @entity14 seemed to apologize for the tax agency 's targeting of @entity18 organizations and other right - wing groups for special scrutiny before granting them tax - exempt nonprofit status			1
@entity6 , @entity14 said , are ' properly concerned ' about what , if true , would be ' outrageous ' @entity3 conduct , and said the bureaucrats responsible would be ' held accountable			1
' ' you do n't want the @entity3 ever being perceived to be biased , and anything less than neutral , in terms of how they operate , ' @entity14 said during a @entity31 press conference with @entity33 prime minister @entity32			1
' i 've got no patience with it , i will not tolerate it , and we will make sure we find out exactly what happened on this , ' he told reporters			0
in a letter to treasury secretary @entity10 , however , @entity7 upped the ante and raised the possibility of criminal charges being brought against @entity3 personnel who probed tea party groups that applied for the right to promise tax deductions to their financial contributors , or for the right to lobby on a not - for - profit basis			1
' the @entity6 people deserve answers about how such seemingly unconstitutional and potentially criminal behavior could occur , and who else was aware of it throughout the @entity56 , ' @entity7 wrote			1
' if investigations reveal that bureaucrats or political appointees engaged in unconstitutional or criminal targeting of conservative taxpayers , they must be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law			1
a source told @entity73 that @entity74 , director of exempt organizations for the @entity3 , is under investigation			2
@entity77 , an attorney in @entity1 who represents nonprofit clients in tax proceedings with the @entity3 , told @entity73 that at least six of his clients have been caught in a ' ridiculous ' situation that has delayed their applications for as long as 30 months			1
' they 're very pissed off , ' he said , ' and they have every right to be pissed off			2
' @entity77 , a partner with the firm of @entity87 and a member of the @entity89 of the @entity90 , called the situation ' clearly more than just bureaucratic idiocy			0
' ' someone made a decision that certain groups should be subject to special scrutiny because of their political views , ' @entity77 alleged , ' the @entity3 actually has a manual that they are supposed to follow , that says you ca n't do this			2
' @entity77 was referring to questions his clients received from the @entity3 , after they filed applications for tax exempt status , which demanded the names and contributions amounts of all their financial donors			1
' @entity107 has already decided , in the @entity108 , that donors should n't be disclosed to anyone except for the @entity3 , ' he told @entity73 , ' but everything these groups tell the @entity3 is open to public inspection once their exempt status is granted			2
' tea party protesters demonstrated in 2012 against the @entity117 's ruling upholding the constitutionality of @entity119			1
dozens of individual organizations have complained that the @entity3 treated them differently from liberal or politically neutral groups hundreds of small protests , like this one involving the @entity124 , have cropped up in 2013 in opposition to the president 's immigration reform package - a topic on which @entity7 has himself been an approving leader in the @entity129 ' with respect to donors , they should never ask that question			1
when they ask me for that information , i tell them they 're not getting it			0
the donors have a right to privacy			0
' ' regardless of who 's in the @entity31 , ' he added , ' i find it personally offensive that anyone in the @entity3 would do this			2
' granting or rejecting tax - exempt status to a nonprofit group should take no more than nine months , @entity77 said			0
when the @entity3 discovered in june 2011 that it was applying a special standard to right - wing groups , he explained , the agency failed to address problems with applications that were already in process			2
that has left some groups waiting for more than two years			0
@entity7 wrote to @entity10 that those in the @entity3 who targeted conservative organizations ' have committed a violation of the public trust that has already had a profoundly chilling effect on free speech			1
such behavior can not be excused with a simple apology			0
' a @entity168 source with knowledge of internal matters at the @entity3 told @entity73 that @entity74 , director of exempt organizations for the @entity3 , is under investigation by the agency 's @entity173			2
@entity77 called @entity74 ' a relatively low - level person			0
' she did not immediately respond to a request for comment			0
@entity1 nonprofit attorney @entity77 ( @entity71 ) said his tea party clients are ' pissed off ' at the @entity3 for making tax decisions according to politics , not by the law @entity7 's spokesman said the senator was traveling and did not have an immediate respond to a questions about whether the senator would accept @entity74 's resignation as a sufficient government response to the scandal , which first broke friday			1
@entity189 has published online a draft timeline that the @entity173 released to selected media outlets			0
it shows that the @entity3 began targeting conservative groups for a special level of investigative scrutiny in early 2010			0
tea party organizations played a major role in the 2010 midterm congressional elections , turning the tide of dozens of @entity31 races and a few @entity129 contests toward @entity201 , and assisting the @entity201 with ousting @entity202 then - speaker of the house @entity203 in favor of @entity206 @entity201 @entity205			1
yet @entity14 said monday that ' if , in fact , @entity3 personnel engaged in the kind of practices that had been reported on and were intentionally targeting conservative groups , then that 's outrageous and there 's no place for it			1
' ' and they have to be held fully accountable , ' the president added , ' because the @entity3 as an independent agency requires absolute integrity			1
' ' and you should feel that way regardless of party			0
i do n't care whether you 're a @entity224 , independent or a @entity201			0
at some point , there are going to be @entity201 administrations			0
at some point , there are going to be @entity202 ones			0
either way , you do n't want the @entity3 ever being perceived to be biased and anything less than neutral in terms of how they operate			0

lawyer on his tea party clients : ' they 're very pissed off , ' he said , ' and they have every right to be pissed off . '
@entity7 complains to treasury secretary about ' seemingly unconstitutional and potentially criminal behavior '
