by @entity0 last updated at 1:57 am on 4th december 2011 model daughter : @entity2 who died after falling from a high rise building in @entity4 for @entity6 , it was the final insult to the memory of her beautiful daughter , who died after falling 150 ft from the balcony of her former lover ’s flat in @entity12			1
police officers had arrived at the family home in @entity15 with two black bin liners , which @entity6 thought would contain her daughter @entity2 ’s personal possessions			1
but when she opened the bags , she discovered a random collection of clothes and shoes that were far too big for her petite daughter , a recent winner of an international beauty contest			1
when @entity6 challenged the officers , they callously joked that the clothes must be ‘ @entity12 sizes ’ – implying that women in the @entity30 are overweight compared with their southern counterparts			1
in her first interview since @entity2 ’s mysterious death in december 2008 , @entity6 , a 57 - year - old widow from @entity32 but now based in @entity33 , @entity15 , reveals how the appalling blunder was typical of a police investigation that she says betrayed her daughter			1
@entity6 said : ‘ i feel the police have failed to carry out a proper investigation into my daughter ’s death			1
they have let down @entity2 and they have let down our family			2
’ the body of @entity2 , a model who was working at @entity49 , was found at the bottom of a @entity12 quayside tower block			1
@entity2 went there to meet @entity53 , 36 , whom she had secretly married in a @entity55 ceremony in 2007 , the same year she won the global face of @entity58 beauty award			2
@entity2 , 23 , had separated from mr @entity53 after discovering her ‘ husband ’ was already married to another @entity55 woman with whom he had fathered two children			2
betrayal : @entity6 and daughter @entity64 feel the police inquiry into @entity2 's death was deeply flawed on december 20 , 2008 , @entity2 went to @entity12 to take part in a fashion show and afterwards visited mr @entity53 to retrieve her possessions , which included designer clothes and family photo albums			1
@entity2 ’s sister , @entity64 , 33 , said : ‘ we do n’t believe @entity2 would have committed suicide			1
two people were alone in that flat , but only one person was left alive			2
we want to know the truth of what happened when they were together that night			2
’ despite repeated requests from the family , it was four months after @entity2 ’s death before @entity85 said they could return her belongings			2
but the family ’s hope quickly turned to despair when they saw the jumbled contents of the bin liners			2
and when @entity6 challenged the officers , she says their response horrified her			2
‘ they just laughed and said the clothes were @entity12 sizes , ’ she said			1
‘ i thought i was going to get my daughter ’s clothes back , but they just joked			1
it was so terrible after all that we had suffered			2
‘ she was the youngest of my five daughters and , ever since my husband died in a motoring accident , i have tried to protect her			2
’ double life : businessman @entity53 with @entity2 at their @entity55 wedding in 2007 @entity64 said : ‘ my sister was very petite			1
she was a size 6 to 8 and these dresses were size 14			1
the shoes were several sizes too big as well			2
‘ they looked as if they had been picked up from a charity shop and the police had n’t bothered to check			1
we did n’t recognise any of the clothes			1
’ the family also claim that police officers did n’t interview them until two weeks after @entity2 ’s death			1
the family solicitor , @entity126 , describes the delay as ‘ extraordinary ’			2
he says that because the police had arrested mr @entity53 over an allegation of murder and he had claimed she may have committed suicide , they should have prioritised assessing @entity2 ’s state of mind just before her death			1
he added : ‘ it ’s very disappointing that more vigorous measures were not taken in this case			2
it was the family ’s impression that the police seemed to have decided it was suicide , which tarnished their approach to the rest of the investigation			1
the family found it very difficult to get any information at all from the police			1
’ the family have instructed leading @entity150 @entity149 to challenge mr @entity53 over his version of the circumstances in which @entity2 fell from his luxury flat			2
mr @entity53 ’s solicitor has repeatedly insisted that he was not responsible for her death			0
the family will also accuse the police of treating them heartlessly and of squandering vital time in the initial stages of the investigation			1
and yesterday it was revealed that @entity85 had asked for an 11th - hour adjournment to the inquest into @entity2 ’s death , which had been due to start tomorrow , to allow the force to consult lawyers			1
betrayal : @entity53 with @entity167 , who was also his wife under sharia law @entity2 met mr @entity53 , a businessman , at a party organised by a fashion magazine in 2006			0
but because he was @entity172 , she kept the relationship secret			0
her four older sisters had all married @entity32 men			0
a year passed before @entity2 told them about her boyfriend			0
@entity64 remembers : ‘ she was impressed by him			0
i remember her saying that he was not like some other @entity58 men			0
‘ she said , “ he ’s open - minded and does n’t want to control me			1
” i remember being happy for her			0
’ but when they met mr @entity53 in @entity33 , the family ’s perception of him changed			0
‘ he drove down in a black @entity187 , but was drinking vodka and kept getting us to drink			0
i did n’t trust him with my sister			1
’ her sister @entity191 was so suspicious she asked mr @entity53 direct whether he had been married before			1
@entity64 recalls : ‘ he said he had n’t and claimed he only wanted to marry @entity2			0
’ @entity64 said he appeared very anxious that their mother would n’t approve of him because he did n’t share their culture			1
he jokingly told them : ‘ tell her not to worry because , although i come from @entity172 , i ’m not a terrorist			0
’ when @entity6 finally met mr @entity53 at a restaurant in @entity199 , @entity200 , to mark the end of @entity202 , the month of fasting in the @entity204 calendar , she remembers feeling ‘ instinctively uneasy ’ about him			0
‘ he told me he would “ not let me down ” , ’ she recalls			0
but the couple did n’t wait for @entity6 ’s approval			0
mr @entity53 and @entity2 moved in together in @entity12 before secretly marrying in a sharia ceremony at a mosque in @entity209 , @entity15 , in 2007			1
tragic : the flats from which @entity2 fell to her death just a few months later , @entity6 was contacted by @entity167 , who claimed to be married to mr @entity53 and was expecting their second child			0
@entity64 said : ‘ it was shocking			0
we told @entity2 that she must come home to @entity15 and leave him			0
’ but @entity2 did n’t believe the family until she spoke to @entity167 , who had sent two photographs of her with mr @entity53 , on the phone at a hotel in @entity12 where the model was staying with mr @entity53			1
according to the family , mr @entity53 told @entity2 that he did n’t want to live with @entity167 any more and that she had not been a good wife			0
‘ he must have persuaded her to stay with him because she would n’t leave him , ’ said @entity64			0
it was only then that @entity2 told the family about the secret wedding and said she wanted a party for all of the family the following year			0
concerned for @entity2 ’s happiness , they agreed to an extravagant ceremony with 200 guests			0
once again , alarm bells started to ring			0
@entity64 remembers mr @entity53 being reluctant for the event to go ahead and he only invited one friend to the ceremony			0
‘ he said his father was very religious and would n’t like him marrying a woman who was n’t @entity172 , ’ she said			0
‘ but we know now that he liked to manipulate women			0
’ soon after the wedding , the couple started rowing and they broke up when it became clear mr @entity53 did not want to move to @entity15 and was n’t prepared to register their marriage with the civil authorities			0
@entity64 said : ‘ @entity2 came back to @entity15 to live with our mother			1
she had got over him and had everything to live for			0
‘ she had started studying finance and accounting at university			0
on the day after her death , we were expecting her at home because she was due to fly out on holiday to @entity259 to celebrate her birthday			0
’ the @entity261 put the detailed claims of @entity6 and her daughter to @entity85			0
it refused to comment , instead reissuing a 2010 statement by detective inspector @entity266 relating to the case			0
he said : ‘ following the tragic death of @entity2 in december 2008 , a thorough investigation was carried out by @entity85			1
a file was prepared for the @entity270 , which reviewed the case and decided that no charges should be brought against the [ then ] 33 - year - old man arrested			1
‘ my thoughts go out to @entity2 ’s family at this difficult time but i am satisfied as a result of our investigation that there are no suspicious circumstances surrounding her death			2
’ mr @entity53 ’s solicitor , @entity286 , said yesterday his client had dealt with these issues during the ‘ comprehensive police investigation ’			1
he added : ‘ my client has given a full account to the police and he has always denied being responsible for the death			2
