by @entity1 reporter published : 05:55 est , 2 december 2013 @entity3 : 07:07 est , 2 december 2013 there is nothing like a glass of wine after a long day , but some @entity8 hold off on this pleasure longer than others it is a moment many of us look forward to – but it seems that some of us wait longer than others to pour our first evening drink			1
for while the average @entity17 uncorks the wine or takes the top off the gin bottle at 7.36pm , a new survey has revealed something of a @entity23 divide when it comes to savouring the first alcoholic drink of the day , with the residents of @entity27 proving the most thirsty			1
they open the door of the drinks cabinet at 5pm , some three hours behind the surprisingly restrained @entity31 who wait , on average , until 8pm			1
the @entity33 , meanwhile , mark the end of the working day with a drink at 6.30pm , while the citizens of @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity40 kick back at 7pm , followed by @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity43 at 7.30 pm			1
the findings , from a survey of three thousand adults aged between 18 and 60 taken last month by market research company @entity47 , form part of the first nationwide report into the nation ’s drinking habits commissioned by drinks website @entity53			0
it found that the @entity56 ’s drinking habits have changed in the last decade , with an increased preference for sour - flavoured drinks			2
vodka , however , remains the @entity56 ’s bestselling spirit , followed closely by gin , which has enjoyed a fifteen percent increase in sales in the last decade			2
that , however , is nothing compared to the renaissance of rum , whose sales have increased by 23 percent in the last ten years as the nation embraces the art of making cocktails at home			0
when they ’re out , though , the nation ’s barmen report a growing preference for sour - flavoured cocktails and more traditional mixed drinks over the last decade , with the whisky - based @entity78 and citrus flavoured @entity81 making a comeback			1
our tastebuds seem to be changing when it comes to beer too , with sales of @entity89 sour up 31 per cent last year alone , making it the second - fastest growing style of beer			0
drinks like @entity94 and red pepper gin fizz ( left ) and @entity78 ( right ) are becoming popular again the average @entity17 uncorks the wine or takes the top off the gin bottle at 7.36pm some things remain reasonably constant however : with the festive season just around the corner , the report found that @entity103 remains the top @entity105 drink – with the traditionally whiskey - drinking @entity31 proving to be the top consumers			1
they stock 16 per cent of the country ’s @entity103 in their drinks cupboard			0
a spokesperson for @entity53 said			0
' it is really interesting to see how different the nations drinking habits are and how our drink preference are changing			0
it seems the further north you go the later the average drink is poured			2
' but what really stood out from our findings is that wherever we live we ’re all becoming more savvy when it comes to food , cocktails and mixed drinks , with a better understanding or and passion for flavours			0

on average we reach for alcohol at 7.36pm , but those in @entity23 wait longer
those in @entity27 drink earliest at 5pm , @entity31 wait until 8pm
the @entity33 wait until 6.30pm while those in @entity37 hold off until 7
in last decade , sour drinks have become more popular , but vodka still @entity137
retro cocktails like @entity81 and @entity78 have made comebacks
