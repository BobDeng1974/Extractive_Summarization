the health effects of what is described as ' the symbol of a bad diet ' are to be examined by scientists in @entity5			2
the deep - fried mars bar has long been a staple of the @entity9 chip shop menu board			1
but despite its reputation as the ultimate unhealthy snack , no research has ever been done to investigate how it affects the body			0
the symbol of a bad halth : deep - fried @entity18 bars have been said to represent the ' high - fat , high'sugar ' diet of so many @entity9 students at the @entity22 are keen to find out , and have launched a project which compares the effects the bizarre delicacy has on blood vessels to those of porridge , another national favourite			1
leading the study is professor @entity31 , the head consultant for stroke at the @entity34 , @entity5 , and the director of the @entity36			0
he said : ' in this student project we will look at what happens to blood vessels in the brain and compare the effects of fried chocolate with another traditional @entity9 delicacy , porridge			1
' porridge has been shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease in the past , while eating chocolate has been shown to reduce the risk of stroke			0
but the effect of either food on blood flow to the brain has never been examined			0
another @entity9 favourite : porridge has been known to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease the study will include 24 volunteers under the age of 40 with a @entity61 between 18 and 30 who will eat the porridge or deep - fried mars bars regularly			1
they are then required to attend the hospital twice for 90 minutes at a time , where their blood flow will be monitored by ultrasound technology			0
the deep - fried delicacy has been a @entity9 favourite since it first appeared in @entity71 in the 1990s			1
since then chippies across the country have received off requests for deep - fried treats such as ice - cream and bananas @entity78 , a student at the @entity22 who will perform the scans told the @entity80 : ' we hope the results will shed more light on the links between diet and stroke and allow health - conscious @entity5 to make a more informed choice in the chip shop			1
' it 's thought the deep fried mars bar first appeared in @entity91 in 1995 , but soon became a @entity5 favourite			2
a 2004 survey found that 22 per cent of fish and chip shops in the city sold the snack			0
the trend has continued with chippies hearing requests for other deep - fried goods such as @entity103 bars , bananas , @entity105 and even ice - cream .			2
