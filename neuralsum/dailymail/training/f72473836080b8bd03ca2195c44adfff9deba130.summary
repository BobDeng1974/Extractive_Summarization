a @entity1 man is living the life of the future after having a microchip implanted under his skin so he can control electronic devices with just a wave of a hand			2
@entity9 had a radio - frequency identification microchip - which has similar measurements to a grain of rice - injected into his left hand through a syringe two weeks ago at a @entity16 tattoo parlour			1
the advertising director 's move comes as technology enthusiasts eagerly await the unveiling of the @entity21 6 in two days time			1
the new addition to his body means mr @entity9 can swing his front door open , switch on his lights and store personal information with the flick of his hand			1
' the most obvious thing the chip allows me to do is store my contact information on it , so that i can just touch a phone with @entity52 and pass my information to their phone			0
that is a great party trick , ' he told @entity58			0
' but it can also trigger an action on my phone to turn the house lights off , open a secure door which is set to recognise the chip or i could - and probably will - set up my car ignition to be linked to the chip for keyless entry and start up			2
' mr @entity9 told @entity58 he made the decision to implant the microchip because he had always been interested in the future of technology			1
' i wanted to get the chip implanted to generate discussion , ' he said			0
' it intrigues me that we live in an age where this type of activity is even possible , especially for some seeming random guy in @entity80 to arrange to have done			0
' it was inserted in a @entity16 tattoo parlour with a syringe containing the chip mr @entity9 said the procedure to implant the microchip was painful , but over quickly			1
' i just needed to be really careful when it was healing over the course of the two weeks later so that i did n't move it - otherwise it could have travelled in my hand , ' he said			0
the microchip implant may still be new to @entity80 shores , but it has become a growing trend in the @entity95 after it was introduced in 2004 when the nation 's @entity96 gave the green light for its use to carry information about people 's medical conditions , according to the @entity103			0
the @entity104 is expected to be the largest phone @entity33 has produced , with a 5.5 - inch screen			2
it is believed the handset is so large that it will come with a special ' one - handed ' mode to make it easier for people to use it			0
anticipation over the phone is so high that people in the @entity95 started lining up outside @entity33 stores two weeks ago to be one of the first to get a slice of the action			2
in the @entity95 , the chip is used to store the medical information of people with illness mr @entity9 hopes the new generation @entity21 6 - which will be launched on september 6 - will have the capability to read the chip			1
