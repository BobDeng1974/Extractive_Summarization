by @entity0 published : 03:52 est , 3 march 2014 updated : 03:58 est , 3 march 2014 chancellor @entity2 today came under fresh pressure to slash duty on petrol and diesel by 3p a litre after damning new figures reveal @entity10 drivers are suffering from the biggest fuel tax burden in @entity12			1
motorists in the @entity10 pay the highest proportion of tax in the @entity16 - despite a government freeze on fuel duty since march 2011 , damning new figures from the respected @entity20 reveal			1
@entity10 face ‘ the greatest fuel tax burden in @entity12 ’ , it says			0
some 60 per cent of the cost of petrol is made up of tax imposed by the @entity26 some 61p in every pound spent at the pumps on a litre of unleaded petrol - and 59p in every pound spent on a litre of diesel – goes directly to the chancellor in fuel duty and @entity36 , says the @entity20			1
it means that of the 28 countries in the @entity16 , @entity10 drivers pay the highest proportion of tax for diesel and the second highest for petrol after @entity43			1
duty on fuel is currently a flat - rate 57.95p per litre			0
but the full tax of the fuel , including duty , is then also subject to an additional tax burden of @entity36 levied at 20 per cent in total – making it a ‘ tax on a tax ’			2
ironically , @entity10 drivers pay some of the cheapest pre-tax fuel in @entity12 – but only before the full tax is levied , says the @entity20			0
the figures were seized on by @entity58 campaigners demanding that the chancellor cut duty by 3p a litre in the @entity62 later this month			1
by the time vat at 20 per cent is added , that would amount to a tax reduction of around 4p			0
chancellor @entity2 has already acted to freeze fuel duty since taking power , but campaigners want him to go further and the @entity20 itself said the chancellor should go ‘ beyond his promise to continue the fuel duty freeze and actually cut the rate further			1
’ the @entity20 figures show that @entity10 drivers who pay £ 1.37 at the pumps for a litre of diesel see 59.09per cent of that going directly to the government as tax			0
that is the highest proportion of tax in @entity12 ahead of second place @entity43 where diesel costs £ 1.24 , of which 56.04 per cent is tax			1
drivers in third place @entity86 pays 54.72 per cent tax followed by @entity88 ( 52.51 per cent ) , @entity89 ( 51.57 per cent ) , and @entity90 ( 50.15 per cent )			0
motorists in seventh place @entity93 are charged just £ 1.09 for litre of diesel , of which 49.90 per cent is tax , ahead of @entity97 ( 49.65per cent ) and @entity98 ( 48.88 per cent ) from a litre of diesel costing just £ 1.17			2
a 3p a litre duty cut – plus the near 1p reduction in @entity36 - would see the @entity10 price drop to £ 1.33p and the proportion of tax to 49.58 per cent , just ahead of @entity98			1
lowest proportion of tax on diesel is in @entity108 where the fuel costs just 98p a litre of which 41.08per cent is tax			2
for petrol , @entity10 drivers pay the second highest proportion of tax after @entity43			1
petrol here is £ 1.30 a litre of which 61.42 per cent is tax , compared to 61.86per cent in @entity43 where the cost of fuel is actually cheaper at £ 1.24 per litre			2
third place is the @entity124 ( 60.65per cent ) , followed by @entity125 ( 59.86 per cent ) , @entity86 959.02 per cent ) and @entity88 ( 58.71per cent )			0
@entity93 is in eighth place at 57.64 per cent just ahead of @entity98 at 57.05per cent			0
if the chancellor cut @entity10 duty by 3p with a 1p fall in @entity36 the @entity10 would drop to 18th place with unleaded costing £ 1.26 of which just over half ( 52.33per cent wold be vat			2
lowest tax for unleaded is in @entity135 where drivers pay £ 1.05 a litre at the pumps of which 44.95per cent is tax , just ahead of @entity141 ( £ 1.09 per litre of which 47.70per cent is tax )			0
professor @entity145 , director of the @entity20 , said : ‘ on 19th march the chancellor will deliver his budget			0
he has made much of the fact that fuel duty has not risen for three years			2
however this has made little impact on the huge proportion of tax the @entity10 ’s 36 million drivers pay on their fuel			2
’ he noted : ’ the irony is that if you take tax out of the equation we actually have the fifth cheapest diesel in the @entity16 and the second cheapest petrol			1
the oil companies and retailers are often blamed for soaring pump prices but these figures reveal that ’s not the whole picture			0
’ fuel duty accounts for 61 per cent of the petrol price in the @entity10 , the second highest proportion in @entity12 professor @entity145 said : ’ with the poorest car owners now spending as much as a third of their income on buying and running a vehicle , and with a record number of people now commuting to work by car , there are plenty of reasons why the chancellor should consider going beyond his promise to continue the fuel duty freeze and actually cut the rate further			1
’ @entity20 research shows that some 800,000 of the poorest car - owning households in the @entity10 spend about a third of their disposable income on buying and running a vehicle			0
its analysis also shows that a record 16.7million people in @entity197 and @entity198 are reliant on a car to get to work : 15.3 million as drivers and 1.4 million as passengers			0
campaign group @entity58 @entity10 seized on the figures to demand a 3p cut in duty , amounting to a near 4p ( 3.6p ) cut after vat			1
@entity204 , lead campaigner for @entity205 said : ‘ having the highest duty for diesel and second highest for petrol in the @entity16 is a cruel and needless burden on the millions who have no option but to commute to work and shop for essentials by car			1
' this is why so many complain they ’re spending so much of their incomes on mobility			0
a fuel duty cut of 3 pence in the @entity221 would hugely benefit everybody in the @entity10 , but especially the poorest			1
’ @entity223 , co-founder of @entity205 said : ‘ this punitive tax on @entity10 road users has to be slashed			0
the chancellor currently takes considerably more at the pumps for diesel in tax than any other @entity16 finance minister			2
' our call for a 3p duty cut would mean that the @entity10 would drop to 18th in the @entity16 ' tax take ' for petrol and 9th for diesel			1
such a fuel duty cut would be self - financing and a vote winner			1
’ a @entity26 spokesman said : ‘ freezing fuel duty has been a major priority of the government			1
as a result , petrol will be 20p a litre cheaper than it otherwise would have been			0
this represents an average saving for motorists of £ 680 over the course of the @entity250			0
‘ to help families with the cost of living , we have also increased the tax free personal allowance , taking 2.7 million people out of tax altogether			0

motorists paying the highest proportion of tax in the @entity16
**58p** on petrol and **58p** on diesel goes to the @entity26 in fuel duty
campaigners call on @entity2 for 3p cut in next month *'s* budget
