@entity1 fans and @entity2 could be forgiven for wishing @entity3 to be prised away from @entity4 and land a job abroad			1
for the @entity6 has long since been the nemesis of the @entity8 and their manager			2
he scored six times against @entity1 as a player , including a match - winning double in an @entity15 semi-final for @entity17 , and is unbeaten in six versus @entity2 , including last season ’s @entity18 double			1
@entity3 scored six times against @entity1 during his illustrious playing career @entity3 is also unbeaten in six games as a manager against @entity1 boss @entity2 @entity3 ( right ) contests with @entity25 ( above ) for the ball as he plays against @entity1 for @entity27 and @entity3 says : ‘ as a player , i have no explanation for it			1
i did not prepare differently , i was just lucky enough to be in positions to score and make the difference			0
‘ the first time i was man - marked in @entity35 was against @entity1 at @entity36 when @entity37 was the manager , and i was with @entity27			2
it felt strange , because i did n't think i was a player to be man - marked ! ‘ but , because i always scored against them , they decided to do it – but i scored anyway			2
so something was happening for some reason			0
‘ every time i went into the box i found the ball was there , every time i made a run the ball was there			0
‘ then , of course , it was probably influenced by the semi-final when i scored two goals at @entity55			0
’ @entity3 enjoyed two @entity15 victories over @entity1 and @entity2 as manager of @entity58 , and he adds : ‘ they were special games			1
it is funny because when you are the @entity62 side you are just trying to beat the top team – it was the same against @entity4 , because we beat them in the cup , too			0
@entity3 ( left ) famously scored a double for @entity17 against @entity1 in the 2000 @entity15 semi final @entity1 manager @entity2 will hope to end his miserable run against @entity3 as a manager on sunday ‘ things happen in football that there is no way to explain			1
but it 's not about me and @entity2 , it is about @entity1 players and @entity4 players			1
‘ we can pick the team but i do n't think that we can be so incredible at picking a unique team to go and mastermind a win			0
no. ‘ i 'm trying not to make it about me and @entity2			2
it 's two clubs , two cities – it 's big enough			0
