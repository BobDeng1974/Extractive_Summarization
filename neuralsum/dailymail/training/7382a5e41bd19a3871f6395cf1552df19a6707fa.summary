a sad little dog that waits in vain at a hospital for her beloved owner who has long since passed away has become @entity6 's answer to @entity8 's ' @entity7 '			1
@entity9 has been turning up looking for her master since he passed away at the @entity12 hospital last year			1
the case mirrors that of the loyal @entity16 terrier who became known as @entity7 for refusing to leave his owner 's @entity8 grave for 14 years			1
doctors are hoping someone will take pity on the dog and offer her a new home			2
' you see her eyes , how sad they are - it 's not the usual shiny eyes for when a dog is happy			0
you can see this in animals in the same way as with people , ' chief doctor @entity37 told @entity43			0
he said : ' there is nothing medicine can do for her here , but we are still hoping that @entity9 will be able to find another owner			1
' one day , and we very much want this day to come soon , our @entity9 will trust somebody			1
' the dog turned up at the hospital two years ago with her sick owner ; she was his only visitor and at night returned to their home to guard it , before returning to the hospital in the morning @entity9 - who looks like a dachshund although staff do not know what breed she is - has been coming into the hospital 's reception every day since her owner was admitted almost two years ago			1
the elderly man , from the village of @entity66 , had fallen ill and came to the hospital with his pet			0
whilst he was staying on the ward , @entity9 was his only visitor			1
at night she returned to their home to guard it against intruders , before returning to the hospital in the morning			1
something she has done ever since			0
nurse @entity75 said a family recently tried to adopt @entity9			2
she was taken to their home on a friday evening , but was back at the hospital by 3am the following day			2
she said : ' i do n't think she will ever leave here			0
' a granite fountain and a statue were commissioned by a countess and erected a year later in honour of @entity7 , who visited his owner 's grave every day for 14 years the dog 's story became a @entity90 movie in 1961 ; the dog who played @entity7 in the film is pictured above with the filmmaker when @entity7 's owner , police night watchman constable @entity95 , died in 1858 he was buried without a gravestone in @entity98 , yet his devoted pet managed to find the spot and stayed there , guarding it and only leaving for food			1
he was seen there every day by people in the @entity106 of @entity107 until his death in 1872			0
a granite fountain and a statue were commissioned by a countess and erected a year later in his honour , and there have been a number of books and movies about his life , including one made by @entity90 in 1961			0
