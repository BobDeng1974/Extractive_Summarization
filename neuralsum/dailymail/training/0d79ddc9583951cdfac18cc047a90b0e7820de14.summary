this is the moment an armed robber burst into a @entity3 store with a handgun , stole the store 's money then apologised to the shopkeeper before running off			1

mrs @entity14 , who a mother to @entity23 , 23 , @entity24 , 22 , and @entity25 , 15 , said : ' i had my head down sorting out paperwork and i heard a customer come in because the chime on the door sounded			1
' the next thing i knew when i looked up a man in a balaclava had a gun pointing at me in my face			2
at first i thought it was a wind up			0
' he wanted the money in the till so i handed it over to him			0
i think he roughly only got away with around £ 80 because i had only been open an hour , i told him it was all i had in the till			1
' i wondered at first whether it was a real gun but when i saw him pull it back , i panicked and started frantically searching in the till			2
' ' the strange thing was , he said " sorry " to me then ran off			0
it makes me think that he must have known me because why would you rob someone and then say sorry for it ? ' it does n't make any sense			0
' the robber demands all the money in the shop till , which mrs @entity14 later said totalled about £ 80 after taking all the cash , the robber then inexplicably says ' sorry ' to mrs @entity14 the @entity18 footage then shows him fleeing the store , with all the shop 's takings stored in a plastic bag @entity65 said money was handed over and the man left the shop with the cash in a small plastic bag			1
the suspect was tall and had a slim build			0
he was wearing a black balaclava over his face , a yellow hoodie with the hood up , blue jeans and dark footwear			0
stills from the @entity18 showed the robber to be armed with what appeared to be a gun before he made off with the cash , passing two customers on the way out			1
mrs @entity14 , who is married to @entity86 , a 44 - year - old taxi driver , said : ' one of the customers tried to follow the robber in his car while the other looked after me while i dialled 999			1
' it 's a really close knit community around here and the owners , @entity96 and @entity97 , say they have never had something like this happen in the 30 years that they have run the store			2
' you usually know everyone who comes in the shop			2
the shock has n't sunk in yet , i 'm still waiting for it to hit me but i 'll still be returning to work , i 've got a mortgage to pay			0
shopkeeper @entity14 ( pictured ) said the shock of the armed robbery had not yet ' sunk in ' @entity109 ( pictured ) said it was the first time he had been robbed in the 30 years he has owned the store the exterior of @entity96 and @entity114 's store in @entity12 , @entity13 ' i think it 's quite risky of the guy to pull a stunt like that all for the sake of £ 80			1
' police are now appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to contact them as soon as possible			0
police chief inspector @entity124 , of @entity125 , said : ' we have extra officers on patrol in the area to reassure residents and answer any concerns people may have			0
' anyone with information should contact police on 101 , extension 69191 , quoting log number 166 of 06/02/15 or ring the independent charity @entity137 on 0800 555 111 .			0
