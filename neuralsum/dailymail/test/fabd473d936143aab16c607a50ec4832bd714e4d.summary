dr @entity1 's fellow faculty members at @entity2 have written an op - ed lashing out at how his ' unsubstantiated medicine ... sullies the reputation ' of the university - in just the latest attack on his talk show tactics			1
but they also leap to the physician 's defense in the piece , saying that his on - air ' @entity13 ' should not cancel out his stellar work at the university , where he has an unblemished record as a doctor			1
the eight staff wrote the op - ed for @entity21 after 10 doctors urged @entity2 to sever all ties with @entity24 , who serves as vice chairman and professor of surgery at the @entity29			1
those doctors accused him of being a ' charlatan ' who promotes ' quack treatments ' on his syndicated talk show - accusations @entity1 has vehemently fought this week			1
they pointed out that in 2014 , the @entity49 medical journal said ' that less than half of the recommendations on his show are based on at least somewhat believable evidence '			0
' many of us are spending a significant amount of our clinical time debunking @entity59 regarding metabolism game changers , ' the staff members wrote in the op - ed. ' irrespective of the underlying motives , this unsubstantiated medicine sullies the reputation of @entity2 and undermines the trust that is essential to physician - patient relationships			1
' that said , ' the weaknesses in [ his ] professional balance sheet ' should not force him out of his job at @entity2 , where he has been employed since 2001 , they wrote			2
he was hired because of his strengths as a doctor and receives top reviews from his peers and patients , and therefore should not be forced to leave the job ' in which he excels ' , they wrote			0
support : the eight faculty members , including @entity85 @entity84 , left , and @entity86			1
right , said they have spent a great deal of their time debunking ' @entity92 ' their colleague had shared on air instead , they suggested that his case raises questions of what responsibilities doctors in the media have to their patients			2
' what happens when a doctor 's job in media - medicine collides with office - or hospital - based medicine ? dr. @entity1 is a case in - point			1
' ' many of us are spending a significant amount of our clinical time debunking @entity59 regarding metabolism game changers			0
irrespective of the underlying motives , this unsubstantiated medicine sullies the reputation of @entity2 and undermines the trust that is essential to physician - patient relationships			1
' ' we need to re-evaluate the roles of the health sciences and government in broadcast medicine and what are the responsibilities of media physicians to their patients ? ' ' non-evidence based medical recommendations presented without the appropriate caveats are costly and potentially harmful			0
however , unless these foibles can be shown to render dr. @entity1 inadequate or ineffective at @entity2 , there is no justification for forcing him to resign from a well - earned position in academic medicine			1
' regulatory guidance addressing the tension between his two positions is potentially a far better solution that could result in improved health care both in the doctor 's office and in the media			0
' dr. @entity1 might begin each program with a simple disclaimer : " the opinions expressed on this program may not be evidence - based or part of accepted medical practice and have no endorsement from @entity2			1
" ' the full op - ed can be read at @entity21 ' non-evidence based medical recommendations presented without the appropriate caveats are costly and potentially harmful , ' they wrote			1
' however , unless these foibles can be shown to render dr. @entity1 inadequate or ineffective at @entity2 , there is no justification for forcing him to resign from a well - earned position in academic medicine			1
' rather , he should start each show with a disclaimer : ' the opinions expressed on this program may not be evidence - based or part of accepted medical practice and have no endorsement from @entity2 , ' they said			1
the op - ed was penned by dr @entity84 , dr @entity86 , dr @entity167 , dr @entity168 and dr @entity169 of @entity170 , dr @entity171 of the @entity172 , dr @entity173 of the @entity174 , and @entity175 of the @entity176			1
on friday , @entity1 , 54 , said he was ' very proud to have that feedback ' from his colleagues as he appeared on the today show			2
' the [ @entity1 ] show has to be much broader than what might take place in a doctor 's office , ' he said			2
' i completely respect why so many of my colleagues might have a difficulty with that , but i 'm also appreciative that many of them do understand why that 's important			0
' while appearing on today , he insisted that , despite the criticisms , his show will continue			2
he has been hosting the program since 2009			0
' without question , the show will survive it , ' he said			2
' i want to keep doing the show for as long as i can because i think we played an important role in making @entity202 a better place			0
' even though he often wears his scrubs on air , he added that his show is not about medicine , but about living ' the good life ' , such as looking at the power of prayer or techniques abroad			2
defense : on friday , dr @entity1 appeared on the today show and said his show would survive the criticism vehement : he told @entity215 that his show was more about living ' the good life ' than medical information he said he continues to stand by his use of the word ' miracle ' to some treatments - but wishes he had not used it for weight - loss supplements			1
' this is a flawed area with lots of fraud , both in the research and in products , ' he said			0
' and we no longer talk about them			0
i have n't talked about them in a year			0
' and talking about the letter from the 10 doctors last week , he said that those critics have agendas , particularly against genetically modified organisms , which he has supported			2
' the 10 doctors who attacked me got what they wanted â€“ sensational headlines and sound bites , ' he previously said on his thursday show , which was entitled @entity243 about his critics			1
' it 's ironic that i am being accused of a conflict of interest by these doctors , when , as you are about to see , some of them have their own conflict of interest issues - and some integrity ones also			2
' four who signed the letter , including leader author @entity257 , have at some point been associated with the @entity259			0
defiant : the celebrity doctor used thursday 's episode of the dr. @entity262 to hit back and claim that the criticism he 's received is part of a conspiracy because of his outspoken views on genetically modified food the organization has previously received grants from @entity271 , who manufactures gmo seeds			0
during his show on thursday , @entity24 denied attacking genetically modified foods			2
' that is not true			0
i have never judged gmo foods , ' he said			0
' but just like 64 countries around the world , i support gmo labeling so you can decide on the foods for your family			0
' dr @entity257 had written of @entity24 : ' he 's a quack and a fake and a charlatan			1
i think i know the motivation at @entity2			0
' they 're star - struck , and like having on their faculty the best - known doctor in the country			0
' but the fact is that his advice endangers patients , and this does n't seem to faze them			0
' @entity2 previously released a statement that it ' is committed to the principle of academic freedom and to upholding faculty members ' freedom of expression for statements they make in public discussion			1

eight faculty members at @entity2 penned an op - ed accusing dr @entity1 's on - air tactics of sullying the reputation of the @entity43 school
but they said he should not be forced to *stepped* down from his ' well - earned position ' at @entity2 because of these ' foibles '
it comes after 10 doctors called on @entity2 to fire @entity24 for promoting ' quack treatments ' on his tv show , including weight - loss supplements
the piece came as dr @entity1 insisted his show would survive the criticism and said the doctors only attacked him for supporting @entity334 labeling
