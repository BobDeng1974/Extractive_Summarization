all around her are the signs of chaos and destruction , buildings reduced to rubble , walls riddled with bullet holes			0
a slab of concrete sticks up precariously from the ground , perhaps the result of an airstrike or mortar attack			0
yet right beside it , sitting dutifully at a table , the little girl smiles warmly as she sells round loaves of bread , a tiny slice of normality for the citizens of the beleaguered city of @entity22			1
defiant : a girl sits amid the rubble and destruction as she sells bread on a damaged street in @entity22 , @entity27 the truly humbling image , captured last week by @entity30 photographer @entity29 , offers a rare glimmer of hope that , despite the violence and destruction things can return to normal			1
@entity22 , in a key oil region in the east of the country , has been the scene of fierce fighting with skirmishes between @entity43 soldiers and government forces reported as recently as this week			1
the surrounding area is now under the control of a lose network of tribes who have seized control of the oilfields and have been exploiting the instability by smuggling barrels of crude into @entity55			0
last week video emerged appearing to show a @entity27 rebel cutting out and eating the heart of a dead government soldier			1
the unverified clip , posted by a pro-government campaign group , claims to show a man - believed to be @entity63 , the well - known founder of @entity65 ' @entity64 - standing over the uniformed corpse in a ditch while ranting against president @entity68			1
free @entity43 fighters return fire during clashes with forces loyal to president @entity68 in @entity22 on monday this week a @entity43 soldier clambers through a doorway as a comrade prepares to fire a machine gun during fighting in @entity22 earlier this week a @entity43 fighter sits on a sofa during a lull in fighting in @entity22 on monday this week using a knife , the man hacks open the torso and removes two organs before holding them up to the camera and declaring : ' i swear to @entity88 we will eat your hearts and your livers , you soldiers of @entity68 the dog			1
' he then raises one to his mouth and takes a bite			0
according to the @entity99 - based @entity27 network of @entity100 , 7543 women including 2454 girls child and 257 infants have been killed by @entity105 's @entity104			1
today the @entity106 is expected to approve an @entity108 - backed resolution calling for a political transition in @entity27 and strongly condemning president @entity68 's regime for its escalating use of heavy weapons			1
the 193 - member world body is scheduled to vote wednesday morning on the resolution which also condemns @entity27 's ' gross violations ' of human rights , assembly spokesman @entity113 said			1
the @entity108 group decided to seek approval for a resolution in the @entity106 to reflect international dismay at the increasing death toll , now more than 70,000 , and the failure to end the ongoing conflict			1
unlike @entity127 resolutions , which are legally binding , general assembly resolutions can not be enforced			0
horror : last week video emerged appearing to show a @entity27 rebel cutting out and eating the heart of a dead government soldier but approval of an assembly resolution would counter the paralysis of the deeply divided @entity127 , where @entity27 's allies , @entity136 and @entity137 , have vetoed three @entity139 - backed resolutions aimed at pressuring @entity68 to end the violence			1
@entity136 's @entity142 ambassador @entity141 has sent letters urging all @entity142 members to vote ' no ' on the new resolution			2
he called it ' one - sided and biased ' as well as ' counterproductive ' given the understanding reached by @entity136 foreign minister @entity148 and @entity150 secretary of state @entity149 in @entity151 earlier this month to convene a follow - up international meeting on a political transition in @entity27			2
@entity155 's @entity142 ambassador @entity154 , asked @entity156 , the lead sponsor , to water down language welcoming the establishment of the @entity160 , the main opposition group , and to eliminate a reference to ' the wide international acknowledgment ' that it is the legitimate representative of the @entity27 people			0
she said in a letter , written on behalf of a group of @entity168 countries , that they also objected to language welcoming @entity172 resolutions on a political resolution of the situation in @entity27 because @entity168 countries did n't participate in their adoption			2
@entity154 also demanded that language be inserted ' explicitly calling for no further militarization of the conflict			0
' @entity136 foreign minister @entity148 and @entity150 secretary of state @entity149 in @entity151 met earlier this month to convene a follow - up international meeting on a political transition in @entity27 but the @entity156 refused to make any of these requested changes , putting support from this group of @entity168 countries in doubt			2
the last @entity108 - sponsored general assembly resolution in august was approved by an overwhelming vote of 133 - 12 with 31 abstentions			1
it strongly condemned @entity27 's use of heavy weapons , deplored the @entity127 's failure to act , said @entity27 must take the first steps to stop the violence , and stressed that rapid progress on a political transition represented the ' best opportunity ' to resolve the crisis peacefully			0
president @entity68 speaks during an interview on @entity27 state television last month diplomats predicted that the resolution being voted on wednesday will get a reduced majority of between 100 and 110 ' yes ' votes because of concerns about the divided opposition			2
using similar language to the august resolution , the proposed new resolution stresses that ' rapid progress on a political transition represents the best opportunity ' to resolve the @entity27 conflict peacefully			2
it would promote the roadmap for a @entity27 transition adopted at a meeting on june 30 , 2012 in @entity217 by key nations including the five veto - wielding council powers - the @entity150 , @entity136 , @entity137 , @entity220 and @entity221			2
the roadmap starts with the establishment of a transitional governing body vested with full executive powers and ends with elections - but there has been no agreement on how to implement it , which would require @entity68 to relinquish power at some unspecified point			0
the draft resolution would reiterate the @entity106 's call ' for an inclusive @entity27 - led political transition to a democratic , pluralistic political system , in which citizens are equal regardless of their affiliations or ethnicities or beliefs			1
' it says this should be done by starting ' a serious political dialogue between credible , empowered , and mutually acceptable interlocutors representing the @entity27 authorities and the @entity27 opposition			0
' the draft strongly condemns the continued escalation in the @entity27 regime 's use of heavy weapons , including indiscriminate shelling from tanks and aircraft , as well as the use of ballistic missiles , cluster munitions and other weapons against populated areas			0
it expresses ' grave concern at the threat by the @entity27 authorities to use chemical or biological weapons , as well as at allegations of reported use of such weapons			0
' it demands that @entity27 ' strictly observe ' international laws prohibiting the use of chemical and biological weapons and refrains from transferring such weapons ' to non-state actors			0
' @entity27 has said if it had such weapons , it would never use them against its own people .			0
