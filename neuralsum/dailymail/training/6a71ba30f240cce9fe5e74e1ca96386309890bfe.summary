by @entity0 published : 04:20 est , 5 june 2012 updated : 04:53 est , 5 june 2012 @entity1 ca n't even eat cheese : computers - while helping direct and organise our lives - are still ' dumb boxes ' for the moment @entity1 has spent the last 15 years becoming smarter and smarter , learning how to power our lives - from our homes , our cars , our phones			1
but - and with apologies to founders @entity12 and @entity14 - all of that work is still no match to the intelligence of a common rat			2
or taking it further , even a gnat			0
the point was made by artificial intelligence researchers @entity23 and @entity24 , who were not criticising the search engine , just pointing out how much further we have to go until we can create computers which contain - or at least , perfectly mimic - intelligent life			1
the researchers , speaking at the @entity29 , pointed out that for all of @entity1 's intelligence , it is still simply learning by rote - just recalling and matching patterns in the information pumped into it			1
@entity23 , a professor of computer and neural science at @entity37 , said : ' it 's rote learning ; there 's no understanding			1
' he said that even the most powerful computers in the world are , in terms of ability , at best approaching that of an insect - and he added : ' i would be happy in my lifetime to build a machine as intelligent as a rat			0
' while many of us benefit from the ease and simplicity of programs like @entity60 for navigation , @entity24 , a professor of computational computer science at @entity54 , said : ' that 's very easy			0
' it 's not even called it @entity64 anymore			1
it 's just called @entity1			2
' that whole context of communication intelligence , of getting inside another person just by the data of what they say and you say back , that 's the heart of human intelligence			0
' clever - but still learning : @entity76 , pictured here on an @entity79 phone , is a clever , intelligent - seeming system - but it is still just code , following instructions to give a comparison for the monumental task ahead of @entity64 researchers , @entity23 described the mechanics of the human brain - how our brains power 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 connections every single second , all working together to provide us with our continuous self - awareness , learning and curiosity			1
but @entity23 was optimistic about our chances , saying : ' the power of supercomputers increases exponentially [ and we will reach that ability ] somewhere between 30 and 100 years			2
' then we wait another 10 or 20 years , and it fits in your smartphone			0
so then your smartphone is smarter than you			0

clever *technology* such as @entity1 is still powered by rote - learning and pattern - matching , say @entity64 researchers **...**
**...** but over the next 30 years , *super-computers* will become smarter , *cheaper* , and smaller
