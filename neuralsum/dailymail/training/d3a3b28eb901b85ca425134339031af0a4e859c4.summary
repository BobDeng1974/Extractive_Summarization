by @entity0 published : 08:36 est , 4 may 2012 updated : 15:57 est , 4 may 2012 @entity1 and culture secretary @entity2 were yesterday granted the right to see key @entity5 documents in advance			1
they will be able to inspect any relevant text messages or emails which have been submitted to the inquiry by other witnesses before giving evidence themselves			2
the ruling by @entity14 at an emergency hearing came ahead of potentially explosive testimony next week from former @entity19 executives @entity17 and @entity20 , the prime minister ’s former spin doctor			0
danger : the government wants to see the evidence of @entity17 and @entity20 as soon as possible in total eight cabinet ministers were named as ‘ core participants ’ in the inquiry			1
these are people who have a significant interest in the hearings or may face criticism			0
the others are : deputy prime minister @entity34 , business secretary @entity33 , education secretary @entity33 , justice secretary @entity33 , home secretary @entity35 and chancellor @entity36			1
the ministers will have the same rights as the dozens of existing core participants for this section of the inquiry , which is looking at relations between the press and politicians			1
they include hacking victims , mrs @entity17 , national newspapers and a number of current and former mps			0
@entity14 said the government ’s application was ‘ somewhat unusual in form ’ , as ministers were not currently seeking to cross-examine witnesses but were applying for advance sight of witness statements			1
too close : @entity1 is seen embracing @entity17 before planting a kiss on each cheek at a glamorous society party he said that @entity60 ’s application on behalf of the government stated that ‘ recent events have underlined and brought into sharp focus the desirability of advance notice ’ – a reference to the @entity2 affair			1
mr @entity2 was disadvantaged by not having prior notice of 163 pages of emails between his office and @entity73 which were submitted to the inquiry last month as part of @entity77 ’s evidence			1
the documents appeared to suggest mr @entity2 ’s office had been helping @entity73 to win its bid to take full control of @entity82 , and had leaked sensitive information to a @entity77 lobbyist in advance			1
the fallout led to the resignation of mr @entity2 ’s special adviser and left the minister fighting for his political life			1
@entity91 , a specialist in media law and partner at @entity94 , said : ‘ this is a controversial move by the government because the hearing to decide who would be allowed core participant status for the third part of the inquiry was held more than a month ago			1
‘ the government chose not to make an application at that stage , and the fact that they are doing so now , so late in the day , suggests they are reacting to events of the past week , and that this has come out of anxiety and nervousness			0
’ friends : the @entity110 and @entity17 live close together and it is rumoured mr @entity1 texted her up to 12 times a day on thursday @entity20 is likely to be asked about how he got the job as the prime minister 's spin doctor before being forced to resign because of the phone hacking scandal			1
while mrs @entity17 could also lift the lid on her friendship with the prime minister , and there is speculation emails and text messages sent between mr @entity1 and the former news international chief executive could be published			2
@entity14 agreed that the individual ministers could seek the status , as long as long as they did not try to question other witnesses or make opening and closing submissions			2
all but one of the ministers have already submitted written witness statements to the inquiry , the hearing was told			2
@entity14 stressed : ' there can be no question of access being sought for the purpose of preparing evidence			0
' the inquiry chairman insisted that all the ministers and their advisers must sign a confidentiality pledge not to leak any of the material they see in advance			1
he said : ' i mean absolutely no discourtesy to ministers or those who will have to assist them , but the rule must apply to everyone			2
' without naming him , @entity14 accused @entity150 mp @entity149 , who has core participant status , of showing ' total disregard ' for the confidentiality agreement he has signed			2
speaking in the @entity154 last week , mr @entity149 quoted from a then - unreleased document listing meetings between mr @entity1 and @entity77			0
it came after @entity158 's evidence last week included more than 100 damaging emails between one of culture secretary @entity2 ’s special advisers , @entity162 , and a @entity77 lobbyist			1
mrs @entity17 has kept all the texts she received from the prime minister , of which there may be more than 12 a day , it was claimed today			0
the government could have applied for the special status more than a year ago but last week 's furore appears to have sparked action from within @entity173			2
prime minister @entity1 and culture secretary @entity2 applied today for the right to see @entity5 documents and witness statements in advance			1
the prime minister said last july that ' with 20:20 hindsight ' he would not have hired mr @entity20 in may 2007 , four months after he resigned from the sunday tabloid over the jailing of royal reporter @entity182 for phone hacking			0
storm : during his evidence last week @entity158 , left , released more than 100 e-mails that left @entity2 , right , fighting for his job mr @entity20 , 44 , became @entity189 ’s communications chief in may 2010 but quit in january 2011 , saying controversy over the hacking scandal was making his job impossible			1
his @entity5 evidence will be the first time he has spoken publicly since being arrested by @entity194 on suspicion of phone hacking and corruption last july			0
he was bailed and has not been charged			0
mrs @entity17 , 43 , edited the @entity197 and @entity198 before becoming chief executive of mr @entity77 ’s @entity200 newspapers division @entity19 in september 2009			0
she and her racehorse trainer husband @entity201 are key members of the influential ' @entity204 set ' , which also includes mr @entity1 and his wife @entity205 , @entity207 presenter @entity206 , and mr @entity77 ’s daughter @entity209 and her pr guru husband @entity208			0
the inquiry has already heard that mrs @entity17 regularly met mr @entity1 and other top politicians along with @entity77 and @entity158			1
she hosted a @entity213 dinner on december 23 2010 , just two days after business secretary @entity33 was stripped of his responsibility for media takeovers for saying he had ' declared war ' on the @entity217 ’ @entity73 empire			2
mrs @entity17 ’s wedding on june 13 2009 was attended by mr @entity1 and former prime minister @entity220			0
mr @entity1 was forced to admit in march that he rode a retired police horse loaned to mrs @entity17 by @entity194 from 2008 to 2010			0
mrs @entity17 has twice been arrested by @entity194 detectives investigating allegations of phone hacking , corrupt payments to public officials and an attempt to pervert the course of justice			0
she was bailed and has not been charged			0
the @entity5 ’s lawyers will not question mrs @entity17 or mr @entity20 about anything that could prejudice the continuing police inquiries or any potential future trials .			0

ministers applied to be ' core participants ' in the probe allowing them to get all documents in advance
the move comes after *embarrassing* e-mails published by @entity158 left culture secretary @entity2 *clinging* on to his job
