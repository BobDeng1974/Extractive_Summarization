by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity3 's previous game in a @entity5 shirt proved rather more dramatic as his final kick in a @entity8 jersey resulted in them winning the 2012 @entity10			1
but there was to be no penalty kick heroics from the @entity13 on his return to the club , as the veteran striker drew a blank in his first game back for the @entity20 outfit			2
@entity5 left the 36 - year - old on the bench for the start of their pre-season friendly at @entity26 's @entity25 , with the @entity8 fielding an attacking trio of @entity28 being supported by @entity29 and @entity30			1
by that point the @entity8 were already 2 - 0 down but @entity3 certainly seemed up for it as he took to the pitch wearing his old no 15 shirt , pointing to the sky with both hands before the second half resumed			1
he was straight into the action too as he just missed out in latching on to a @entity62 pass - signs perhaps that the legs may be starting to show their age			0
but despite an early flurry , @entity5 failed to turn a decent spell on the ball into any serious sort of pressure and @entity3 quickly faded out of the game in the central attacking role			1
like @entity28 before him , @entity3 simply could n't make it work with a support cast of @entity29 and @entity30 and the duo were replaced 12 minutes into the second half			1
all yours , skip : @entity62 gave drogba the captain 's armband later in the game after @entity79 departed not your day : @entity3 reacts by lifting up his shirt after missing a chance on his @entity5 return what did i do ? @entity3 's afternoon was one of frustration as the @entity8 played poorly in the pre-season loss shortly after , @entity5 had their best chance			1
but in a counter attacking move which started from a @entity26 corner , @entity3 was nowhere to be seen			0
a quick breakaway saw substitutes @entity93 and @entity95 combine before squaring a pass for @entity62 to chip over the crossbar			0
@entity3 was constantly marshalled by @entity26 's @entity98 and it was n't until the 70th minute until he got back into the action - albeit with a clever run into the box ending with his cut - back easily cleared			2
with 15 minutes to play , the former @entity105 hitman had his brightest moment of the half as he collected a @entity62 pass			0
it looked like vintage @entity3 was back , but at an angle to goal , he rifled off target at the near post with options open to him inside the box for a pass			0
not that you can blame him for having the temptation to shoot in a pre-season exercise			0
@entity3 ended the game as captain after @entity79 departed late on , but rather than help lead a fightback , @entity5 conceded again a minute before time with the hosts scoring their second penalty of the afternoon			1
fans will hope a couple more weeks of pre-season training will get him back up to speed with the @entity127			0
fans will never forget how @entity3 ended his first @entity5 spell in @entity130 but just as many will soon forget his rather anonymous showing in @entity133 on his return two years later			0
@entity135 moves : @entity3 showed touches of skills as he turns to shake off attention from @entity139 all in : @entity3 got stuck into battles as he challenges @entity26 's @entity141 for a header no way past : @entity144 makes a tackle on @entity3 who failed to hit the target on his return			2

@entity3 played first @entity5 game after *joining* on free from @entity151
@entity13 striker was second half substitute for @entity28 in 3 - 0 defeat by @entity26
@entity79 handed him captaincy later in game , but 36 - year - old failed to trouble @entity40 side in front of goal
