by @entity0 published : 00:01 est , 26 february 2014 @entity2 : 11:45 est , 26 february 2014 @entity4 's most powerful drug cartel leader employed high - tech communications gadgetry and sophisticated counterespionage practices to elude an international manhunt for 13 years , according to a news agency			1
in the end , however , life on the run unraveled for @entity13 ' @entity12 in a decidedly low - tech way			1
a traditional wiretap in southern @entity16 pointed authorities to a cellphone being used by a top associate			0
within a day , @entity12 was captured in a high - rise beachfront condominium in @entity21 , @entity4			1
both spoke only on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the situation by name			0
' he did n't spare any expenses when it came to protecting himself , ' the law enforcement official said			0
some of the communications equipment @entity12 used was not generally available to consumers			1
the sophistication of the gear and @entity12 's diligence deeply impressed investigators who were pursuing him			1
among other practices , @entity12 employed countersurveillance scanners to detect transmitters hidden in rooms or carried by people with whom he was meeting			1
' it was top - notch , ' the law enforcement official said			0
because @entity12 was so well protected , he managed to attend family events and marry a local beauty queen in a well - attended bash in his home state of @entity65 , all while keeping his multinational , billion - dollar drug empire thriving			1
@entity12 is escorted to a helicopter in handcuffs by @entity4 navy marines at a navy hanger in @entity26 @entity36 and @entity4 officials spent years hunting for a weak spot in his network			1
the @entity36 government official said the @entity75 and @entity76 used traditional wiretaps to zero in on @entity12			2
at times in the last year , agents were able to intercept @entity81 messages and other communications			0
earlier this month , authorities raided one of @entity12 's suspected hideouts in @entity86 , the capital city of @entity65 , where @entity12 operated with near impunity			2
inside , they found a cellphone belonging to his communications chief , which helped lead to a trusted courier , the government official said			0
the courier later described for authorities a series of houses @entity12 used as hideouts			2
at least one other arrest pointed @entity12 's pursuers to the @entity101 city of @entity21			2
the most important clue came from an @entity76 wiretap monitored in @entity104 , @entity16 that information directed @entity4 marines to the exact condominium where @entity12 had been hiding since outrunning troops days earlier through interconnected tunnels beneath his @entity86 hideouts			2
the officials would not discuss the specific methods used over the last 13 years			1
@entity113 aided : these photographs , taken from @entity12 's 1993 and 2014 detentions , show identification mapping marks that proved to @entity4 authorities that the man they 'd arrested was indeed the drug lord the fingerprint test of @entity12 during the scientific probe to prove his identity an interconnected tunnel in a @entity86 drainage system that infamous drug boss @entity12 used to evade authorities one of the properties that was interconnected by tunnels in @entity86 an open steel reinforced door leads to the interconnected tunnels in @entity86 the law enforcement official said @entity12 was n't holed up in the rugged mountains of western @entity4 while on the run			1
with the help of his own trusted security force and the likely assistance of some @entity4 authorities , @entity12 had moved freely about parts of @entity4 and even internationally			1
' he moved for the most part with impunity ( in @entity86 ) , ' the official said			0
' he traveled at will			0
he was a businessman and he would go and meet people to discuss not just the drug trade			0
he was obviously interested in the money trade , the markets			0
he was looking at expanding the empire			0
' by the time of his capture , @entity12 's empire stretched from @entity151 through @entity152 , @entity153 , parts of @entity155 and @entity156			2
he is believed to have amassed a fortune worth billions			2
@entity36 and @entity4 authorities were close to nabbing @entity12 in the past but arrived at resorts or other locations hours or days too late , the law enforcement official said			2
they were never closer than in recent weeks			0
last week , @entity12 's pursuers were on his heels during raids at the stash houses in @entity86			2
the law enforcement official said @entity12 was believed to be just ahead of @entity4 troops when he vanished in the underground network below the houses before absconding to the high - rise condo in @entity21 , along the coast			1
@entity12 appears set to remain in @entity4 's highest - security prison for the foreseeable future , as the government puts off @entity36 extradition in a move that could bolster president @entity179 's nationalist credentials but also shine a spotlight on the country 's woeful judicial system			1
experts say @entity179 's administration and those of his predecessors have proven unable to match headline - grabbing arrests like @entity12 's with complex , long - term investigations and prosecutions of deep - rooted criminal networks			1
cases have stalled and cartels have continued to operate			0
last year , one of @entity12 's closest allies walked out of the prison where the @entity36 said he was running drugs from behind bars			1
the @entity4 government says there is no way @entity12 will repeat the 2001 escape that let him roam western @entity4 for 13 years as he moved billions of dollars of cocaine , methamphetamine and heroin around the world			1
authorities here say they want to be the first to interrogate @entity12 , and use the information to dismantle his @entity65 cartel			2
two federal judges ruled tuesday that @entity12 will have to stand trial on separate drug - trafficking and organized - crime charges in @entity4			1
@entity179 's administration said the man widely considered the world 's most - powerful drug lord until his capture saturday will face at least six other pending criminal cases before it even considers extraditing him to the @entity36 ' i do n't think it 's going to happen anytime soon , ' attorney general @entity220 said in a radio interview			2
' this is the start of a full investigation that will allow us to fully eradicate his organization			0
it would be pointless to do anything else			0
' a soldier stands on a truck after security was stepped up outside the building of the attorney - general for @entity235 into @entity236 in @entity26 military personnel walk on a sidewalk outside the building of the attorney - general for @entity235 into @entity236 in @entity26 @entity240 : @entity12 's wife ( left ) @entity241 and a wanted poster displayed at the @entity243 experts on both sides of the border warned that keeping @entity12 in @entity4 hands could squander the opportunity to exploit his unparalleled knowledge of the country 's biggest drug cartel			1
@entity36 prosecutors have proven far more capable of offering captured drug lords the incentives to cooperate with law enforcement , experts said			0
@entity36 officials routinely use family members as tools to pressure defendants into giving up information , granting visas to relatives of cooperative prisoners while threatening to leave loved ones penniless by freezing assets of drug lords who refuse to play ball			0
@entity4 authorities arrested @entity12 , 56 , along with his 20 - something former beauty - queen wife and twin toddlers , but let her go because there were no charges pending against her			1
observers called it a staggering missed opportunity that would n't have occurred in the @entity36 ' the @entity36 attorneys have many tools			0
they 're pretty good at flipping people			0
they can offer far more things than the @entity4 authorities can offer , ' said @entity283 , a security analyst and former official in @entity4 's domestic intelligence service			0
view of the inside of the @entity289 condominium in which @entity12 was arrested on sunday clothes and toiletries are scattered on a bed in a bedroom of the apartment where @entity12 was seized one of @entity12 's closest allies and mentors , @entity298 , walked out of a federal prison in august after a procedural ruling that cut 12 years off a 40 - year sentence for killings that included the murder of @entity75 agent @entity304			1
a three - judge federal appeals court in the western state of @entity307 found that he should have been tried in state court , not federal , and vacated his sentence in a ruling widely seen by @entity4 and @entity36 officials as inexplicable and likely corrupt .			0

@entity13 ' @entity313 ' @entity12 escaped prison in 2001 and was caught again at weekend
he *deployed* state - of - the art *counter-surveillance* measures to evade police
for 13 years he moved billions of dollars - worth of drugs around the world
