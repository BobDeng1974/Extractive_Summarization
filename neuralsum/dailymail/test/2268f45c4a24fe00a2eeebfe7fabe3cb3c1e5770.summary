we all know the time - consuming hassle of having to hoover the house , so it is perhaps no surprise to find that sailors on board this @entity6 aircraft carrier also got bored of sweeping the decks			2
what is perhaps more surprising is their solution to the problem , which involved strapping an old jet engine to the front of a tractor , and using the contraption as a huge leaf - blower			1
the crew of the @entity20 , @entity6 's largest warship , came up with the novel idea to help keep the deck clear of debris which poses a major risk to jet planes taking off and landing			1
@entity6 sailors on board the @entity20 , the country 's largest aircraft carrier , have come up with an inegnious way of cleaning the decks , by strapping an old mig - 15 engine to the front of a tractor debris on carrier decks can potentially get sucked into jet engines , so crew are usually required to do manual sweeps of the deck , but the crew of the @entity20 decided to do away with that bother even a single stray nut or bolt , if sucked into one of the fighter plane 's engines , could spell disaster for the pilot , and cause millions of dollars worth of damage			1
usually crew members are forced to go around manually checking for stray objects , using sweeper vehicles to help tidy them up			0
but with 14,700sq ft of deck space to check and recheck every single day , the crew of the @entity20 decided to do away with that bother , and took a more direct approach			2
according to blog @entity59 , the sailors have attached an old mig - 15 engine to the front of a tractor , before fitting the front end with a diffuser , spreading the air out over the ship 's deck			1
the vehicle is then driven up and down the 1,000ft - long deck , blowing all debris overboard			2
the massive @entity20 is the jewel in president @entity73 's military fleet , carrying a total of 18 fighter jets and 17 anti-submarine helicopters			0
the ingenious crew members fitted the old @entity79 engine with a diffuser , spreading the air out over the deck , and use the contraption like an enormous leaf blower , sending debris overboard the @entity20 has a deck spanning 14,700sqft , so rather than search the entire thing by hand , @entity6 sailors built themselves a giant leaf - blowing machine instead bristling with anti-aircraft cannons , rocket batteries , gatling guns and underwater missiles , it weighs in at 43,000 tons and carries 1,690 crew			1
however , that is nothing compared to the @entity100 nimitz class aircraft carriers , the tenth and last of which , the @entity101 , was commissioned in 2009			0
the ship weighs 102,000 tons , is powered by two on board nuclear reactors and is capable of carrying almost 6,000 crew and air company who pilot its 90 aircraft and helicopters			0
the @entity112 's largest carrier in the @entity113 , weighing in at 65,00 tonnes , it carries 40 jets and helicopters , along with 1,600 crew			0
the @entity20 is the largest carrier in the @entity118 , built it 1985 it carries 18 fighter jets , 17 anti-submarine helicopters and 1,690 crew			0

debris on carriers can get sucked into jet engines , causing deadly *crashes*
sailors are therefore usually required to search decks for debris by hand
but crew of @entity20 made themselves vehicle to speed up job
*consists* of mig - 15 engine strapped to tractor to act as giant leaf blower
