@entity0 is planning to release a hydrogen - powered car in march 2016 that , in an emergency , could even power your house			1
the clean - energy car called the @entity6 , which emits only water as a waste product , will have a range of 300 miles ( 480km ) and seating for up to five people but problems with hydrogen fuel , such as a lack of infrastructure to support a nationwide fleet of cars , will need to be solved before the technology is adopted			1
the vehicle runs solely on hydrogen fuel and will be released in march 2016			1
hydrogen fuel is desirable because it only emits water and heat			1
the zero - emission fuel is heralded as a replacement for petrol one day hydrogen fuel has been heralded as the future of automobiles , and possibly leading to a ‘ hydrogen economy ’ where many things run on the element , as it is a zero - emission fuel			1
cars employing the fuel use electrochemical cells or combustion to turn it into heat , with the only by - product being water			2
a report by @entity41 has suggested that @entity42 is looking to develop its own hydrogen vehicle			2
rumoured to be called the i5 , the vehicle would compliment the existing electric i3 and hybrid i8 in the i - brand series			0
aside from @entity0 , the i5 would compete with other hydrogen cars from @entity51 and @entity52			1
and there are also rumours that @entity54 and @entity55 could be release hydrogen cars of their own in the not too distant future , possibly by 2017			1
many car manufacturers have been toying with the idea of hydrogen cars including @entity51 and @entity42			1
and now @entity0 ’s latest effort , the successor to their @entity64 hydrogen fuel car , will soon be on its way			1
there is no news yet on the price of the car or what its top speed will be , but the release date of march 2016 in @entity19 is known			1
@entity0 says a release in the @entity75 and @entity76 will then follow			0
the car has a power output of more than @entity79 and an increased ‘ power density ’ of 60 per cent over its predecessor			0
this gives the car its impressive range of 300 miles ( 480km )			0
the @entity6 also apparently has an external power feeder than , during an emergency , could be used to power an entire home			0
the clean - energy car called the @entity6 ( illustration shown ) , which emits only water as a waste product , will have a range of 300 miles ( 480km ) and seating for ‘ up to five ’ people coconuts could play a key role in making non-polluting cars that only emit water a reality			1
for years , scientists have been working out how to develop fuel cell cars powered by pure hydrogen , but are unsure how to store the substance effectively			1
now , they may be close to solving this problem using the unlikely candidate			0
researchers from @entity108 ’s @entity107 used coconut kernels to store hydrogen in gas form			0
professor @entity113 and his team , at the university ’s @entity111 created carbon from coconut kernels , which contain fatty and organic acids as well as potassium , magnesium and sodium			0
he says that the kernels , which are easily found , are cheap and can easily be converted into carbon			0
and the researchers found that the carbon produced from the kernels could store a ‘ considerable ’ amount of hydrogen			0
@entity0 's newly announced @entity129 vehicle will be the successor to the @entity131 , seen here being refuelled at the @entity133 's first open access hydrogen vehicle refuelling station in @entity134 in 2011 the vehicle can be refuelled in just three to five minutes , although the specialist hydrogen - fuel is not widely available at stations yet			2
@entity111 itself is also a bit of a problem			0
although it is widely billed as a potential replacement for petrol , pure hydrogen does not occur naturally on @entity144			2
this means it needs to be made via other means , such as using methane , but the process is complicated			0
and attempts to replicate the process using renewable sources have proven to be expensive			0
nonetheless , car manufacturers are banking on hydrogen ultimately becoming a major source of fuel in the future , and @entity0 especially is keen to stay at the front of the game			2
‘ @entity0 has led the industry for nearly two decades in the development and deployment of fuel - cell technology through extensive real - world testing , including the first government fleet deployment and retail customer leasing program , ’ the company said in a statement			2
‘ since the introduction of its first generation fuel - cell vehicle , the @entity171 , in 2002 , @entity0 has made significant technological advancements in fuel - cell vehicle operation in both hot and sub-freezing weather while meeting customer expectations and safety regulations			2

@entity19 company @entity0 has unveiled its new @entity6 concept car
the car runs solely on hydrogen fuel and will be released in march 2016
hydrogen fuel is desirable because it only emits water and heat
the zero - emission fuel is heralded as a replacement for petrol one day
but producing pure hydrogen is *difficult* and expensive for now
car makers though are banking on hydrogen fuel being the next *big* thing
@entity0 , @entity54 , @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity42 are all working on hydrogen cars
