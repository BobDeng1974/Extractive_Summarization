when she began her career as a professional sheep dog @entity2 was impressive - the sheep responded well to her , she was faster than your average and she certainly looked good			2
but farmer @entity7 has reluctantly decided to sell @entity8 as she is now too big to get through his farmyard gates - because she is a @entity10 estate car			1
mr @entity7 , 46 , who lives on an 180 - acre farm near @entity12 in @entity13 , converted the family car into a working sheep dog in tribute to his dog which had recently died			1
floss the sheep dog car , who has a top speed of 40mph , soon proved to be a surprisingly effective herder as the flock of sheep failed to notice they were being rounded up by a much larger animal with headlamps for eyes and an exhaust			2
mr @entity7 , who also has a herd of pedigree @entity40 cattle , said : ' i know it was a bit of a mad thing to do but it was a tribute to my old sheep dog @entity8 who passed away			1
' i have three kids and we loved her and as a family we all missed her terribly			0
mr @entity7 built a wooden frame and covered the estate car in fur following the death of his favourite sheep dog the giant car has proven to be an excellent herder - as the sheep do n't seem to have noticed the difference ' so i got together with a friend and we built @entity8 the sheep dog car in my barn , copying as closely as i could every last detail of my old dog			1
' sheep are n't known for their intelligence and they did n't seem to notice the difference so they were quite happy			0
' we even had a charity day on the farm and the car was a big hit			0
' mr @entity7 's unusual experiment has come to an end as @entity8 the car is simply too big to get around the farm but @entity8 the car , which is not licensed to drive on public roads , is now too big to navigate along the narrow farm tracks and through the gates to mr @entity7 's fields			1
because @entity8 also required a timber frame built around the @entity10 's chassis to attach the fur , the car is now taking up too much space in the barn of a busy working farm			2
mr @entity7 has decided to sell faithful floss on @entity90 and hopes she will go to a good home mr @entity7 added : ' they were things we did n't really consider when we built her so with a heavy heart she is going on e-bay			1
' it 's been a lot of fun and she handles well , is obedient and nice and docile and surprisingly aerodynamic			0
' but its back to the tried and tested traditional skills of the sheep dog again			0
' mr @entity105 hopes @entity8 the sheep dog car may interest festival organisers or dog charities as a fun car			1
' as long as she goes to a good home i 'll be happy , ' he said			0
floss shares more than a few characteristics with the iconic @entity116 van immortalised in the cult film @entity117			0
actors @entity118 and @entity120 attend the premiere of ' @entity122 ' on monday night in the iconic @entity116 van			0
