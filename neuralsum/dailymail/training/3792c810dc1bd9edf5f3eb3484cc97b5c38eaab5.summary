court documents reveal that @entity15 sent his son @entity14 a text at 1.04pm telling him that he was already seated in the theater
when @entity14 , a police officer arrived late to the 1.20 showing , the trailers were playing and he tried to spot his father
that is when @entity15 , a retired police *captain* , shot and killed @entity21 because apparently mr @entity21 's texting disturbed @entity14
records released thursday show that @entity14 , 71 , had *previously* made a complaint to the theater managers about a different texting incident
@entity14 is on trial for second degree murder and aggravated battery since the bullet that killed mr @entity21 also injured his wife , @entity103
