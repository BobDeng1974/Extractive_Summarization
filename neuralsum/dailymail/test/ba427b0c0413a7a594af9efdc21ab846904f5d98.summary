industry sources said the firms are discussing a ' wholesale access agreement ' that would help @entity0 create a global network customers would then be able to use this global network to make calls , send texts and use data as part of their plan , regardless of where in the world they are			1
in particular , a deal with @entity38 would extend the service to the @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity43 , but the plans would only affect the small base of customers on @entity0 's plan			1
last week three extending its feel at @entity49 to @entity43 and @entity50			0
@entity51 lets three customers use their phones , and their plans , in the same way they can at home even when they 're in a foreign country			2
@entity43 and @entity50 take the total number of @entity47 at home countries to 18			0
the other nations include @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity42 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 , the @entity74 and the @entity75			0

@entity43 and @entity50 were the latest countries to join this scheme a mobile virtual network operator ( @entity122 ) is a company that offers mobile service plans using existing networks			1
mvnos do n't own the infrastructure the networks are built on			0
instead , they buy access to parts of these networks at wholesale prices			0
the company can then use this access to run its own wireless plans and resell the connectivity back to customers - usually at a reduced rate			0
@entity141 in the @entity75 , for example , is an mvno because it runs on @entity143 ’s network			2
in the @entity40 , @entity144 shares @entity145 ’s , and ultimately @entity147 ’s , networks			0
an mvno is typically run as an independent company , with its own staff and customer service this would make @entity0 a mobile virtual network operator ( @entity122 ) similar to @entity141 in the @entity75 that runs on @entity143 ’s network , and @entity144 in the @entity40 which shares @entity145 ’s networks			1

mr @entity167 said : ‘ we want to be able to experiment along those lines , [ but ] we do n't intend to be a network operator at scale			1
’ he described the plans as a ‘ project ’ and will do it on a small enough scale to not threaten existing networks			0
in particular , mr @entity81 said the setup should provide at seamless connection between @entity179 and mobile networks			1
sources said at the time of the original rumours that any @entity0 - branded mobile network would initially launch in cities that have @entity90			1

@entity0 's vice president @entity81 ( pictured ) confirmed rumours his firm was launching a mobile network plan during during a talk at @entity86 in @entity87 in february			1
instead of building masts , @entity0 will buy access to existing networks and sell connectivity back to customers at a cheaper rate @entity199 has launched a ' @entity200 ' that makes fees charged by banks for using your card abroad a thing of the past			1
based on an average 10 - day holiday , @entity207 told @entity209 a family of four could save almost £ 110			0
the @entity200 looks and works like a standard debit card , but it connects to an app and lets users consolidate multiple cards onto one account			2
the banking fees are paid for by @entity199 and savings are shown in real - time			0
and if a card is lost or stolen it can be blocked using the app. in 2013 , the firm announced it was expanding the service to @entity224 in @entity92 , @entity225 in @entity93 and a number of other towns in @entity228 and @entity229			0
more locations are due to be added later this year , but the roll - out is slow because @entity0 has to install the relevant infrastructure needed			2
@entity90 starts at $ 70 ( £ 42 ) a month and has been praised for offering high speeds at relatively low prices			0
@entity0 ’s wireless plans would remove some of the costs , and time spent , in setting up its own network and it would equally benefit from using already established and well - connected networks			2
