by @entity1 reporter last updated at 8:45 am on 15th february 2012 @entity2 , 59 , faces charges of kidnapping and aggravated sexual assault a @entity7 woman who prosecutors say was tortured for 12 days seemed to be in shock as she spoke to authorities following her rescue , initially defending the man accused of hanging her from a deer - skinning device and chaining her to a bed , according to a recording of the interview played at his trial on tuesday			1
the woman is heard telling an investigator that @entity22 , her former neighbour , told her he 'd been hired to kill her			2
during the rambling interview after she was found last march , she also said some of her relatives wanted to harm her over a property dispute and urged the investigator to arrest them			0
she said she did n't want to get @entity22 in trouble because ' he 's been good to me , ' but later said he was ' mean			1
' @entity22 , 59 , is accused of abducting the woman from her rural home , driving her some 100 miles away to his house in @entity33 , about 50 miles south of @entity34 , and holding her captive for nearly two weeks			1
@entity22 is charged with aggravated kidnapping and two counts of aggravated sexual assault			2
if convicted , he would face up to life in prison			0
testimony is expected to resume on wednesday			0
in the audio recording , an investigator repeatedly yet gently questions the 62 - year - old woman before she said @entity22 hit her with a rolling pin and tied her up march 1 inside her @entity47 home			1
she said she briefly escaped and ran down the road before he caught her , pulled out his gun and forced her into the back seat of his vehicle			0
she said @entity22 was mad when they arrived at his home , and he hit her with a whip and put her wrists in some type of device that hoisted her off the ground			2

a cable was attached to the garage ceiling			0
@entity22 , seen here last year , allegedly tortured the woman , who used to live near him and on whom he had reportedly had a crush ' i do n't know what it is but he pulled me up in the air , ' the woman is heard saying on the audiotape			1
' it scared me to death			0
' she also said @entity22 told her his fingerprints were all over her house so he would have to torch it — which authorities say he did two days later			1
sgt @entity88 , a @entity47 sheriff 's investigator , told jurors that authorities conducted a massive ground search after fire officials did n't find the woman 's body in the rubble of her burned home near @entity97 , which is about 60 miles west of @entity34			2
he said authorities had few leads until a neighbour reported seeing an unfamiliar blue car drive by twice on the day of the fire , and bank records showed no activity on the woman 's account — except for a $ 500 check recently cashed by @entity22			1
investigators later found out that @entity22 had a blue car and once lived in that area			2
when authorities went to @entity33 on march 12 , @entity22 answered the door and said he was alone — but then the woman ran out and said , ' i 'm here ! i 'm here ! ' @entity88 testified			2
she had a broken arm , head injury and multiple bruises , an emergency room doctor testified			0
the victim 's house and car were destroyed in a fire			1

defence attorneys declined to make an opening statement on tuesday , though they questioned @entity88 about whether authorities took photographs and collected evidence at @entity22 's house before proper search warrants were obtained			1
authorities had a search warrant only for @entity22 's blue car when they first arrived at his house , but @entity88 said law enforcement officers went inside after the woman ran out to make sure nobody else was being harmed or was a threat			1
evidence was seized after another search warrant was obtained for the house the next day , @entity88 testified			0
@entity22 will not use an insanity defence and is competent to stand trial , his defense attorneys said at a court hearing last month			2

@entity22 told police he strung the woman up on a homemade deer skinning rack he had in his garage			1
