by @entity0 follow @ @ charliefscott @entity2 boss @entity1 is eyeing a decade of @entity4 dominance after signing @entity5 , @entity6 and @entity7			1
@entity1 splashed out around £ 80million to bring the trio to @entity9 from @entity10 , where @entity5 had been deemed surplus to requirements at @entity13 and @entity7 and @entity6 had just led @entity14 to the league title			1
‘ a team which has been a winning team for ten seasons is changing step by step , we ’ve bought new players and we are trying to build for the next decade , ’ said @entity1 , in a press conference at @entity2 ’s hotel in @entity18 , @entity19 , on tuesday			1
‘ we had a very young team at the time but , even so , we reached the semi-finals and were playing to win the competition			2
‘ this season we think we are going to be stronger , the younger players are more experienced , they are stable and better adapted to fighting for titles			1
’ despite acknowledging the competitiveness of the @entity56 top flight , the 51 - year - old said he would not be at @entity9 if he did not think @entity2 could win the @entity4 next season			1
‘ if i did n’t think that way i would go home and let somebody else take charge of the team , ’ said the @entity59 boss			1
@entity66 maestro : the signing of @entity5 will transform how @entity2 line up next season @entity69 : @entity6 gets a quick snap with a fan at @entity2 's pre-season camp in @entity19 ‘ people can speak about other leagues but @entity56 is the only country where five or six teams can win the title			1
football is about competitiveness every weekend and that only happens in the @entity4			2
‘ when you have the two @entity82 clubs , the three clubs from @entity83 – @entity81 , @entity84 and ourselves – plus @entity86 , that ’s six top teams , where all of them can win the title			0
that ’s why everybody loves the @entity4			0
‘ at @entity2 , if we did n’t think we could win the league , or did n’t think we had the quality to do it , we would n’t be here working so hard			1
‘ we respect our opponents and their ambitions , because they have the same ambitions as us , but we want to win the @entity4 and we are ready for that			2
’ a number of @entity100 ’s top clubs have spent big this summer , with @entity13 splashing £ 75m on @entity101 and @entity102 recruiting @entity105 stars @entity103 and @entity106 for a combined fee of £ 89m			0
get into the groove : @entity109 will be relieved to make his return with @entity111 threatening his place powerhouse : @entity6 will pose a handful for @entity4 defences next season when on runs like this one domestically , @entity84 have brought in @entity118 from @entity13 for £ 30m , while @entity86 have signed @entity119 , @entity120 , @entity121 and @entity122 and @entity123 have shelled out more than £ 50m on @entity124 and @entity125			2
@entity1 , who believes this spending will make the @entity127 as competitive as ever , says he is focusing on just progressing from the group stages of @entity100 ’s premier competition , before the club can even consider replicating last season ’s run to the last four – where they were beaten by @entity14			1
‘ you look around , to @entity27 , @entity137 and elsewhere in @entity56 , teams are getting stronger , spending big amounts of money and trying to sign the best possible players			0
‘ we will go to the @entity127 group stage with one objective : to qualify			1
when you reach the last 16 let ’s see what happens			0
’ improvements : @entity102 have strengthened considerably , including the acquisition of @entity103 spanish fly : @entity101 completed a £ 75million move to @entity13 earlier in july @entity2 play the first game of their pre-season tour of @entity100 on wednesday against @entity153			0
@entity1 has praised the warm reception he and his squad have been given by local residents in @entity19			2
‘ when we decided we wanted to stay in @entity100 we had to find the right place to come , ’ he explained			0
‘ here , everything is good ; the hotel , the service , the training ground			0
to have two training pitches together is important for our work and our organisation			0
‘ the people are very nice and friendly and they always wait until the end of our training session to ask for an autograph			0
at this moment everything is very nice for us			0
