by @entity0 published : 16:41 est , 20 may 2013 updated : 16:41 est , 20 may 2013 the penalty phase of the @entity3 murder trial wrapped up for the day on monday after a series of legal arguments in which her defense lawyers asked for a mistrial and to withdraw from the case			1
the trial is scheduled to continue on tuesday with @entity11 speaking to the jury			1
the judge denied the defense 's request for a mistrial based on a key witness receiving death threats			1
in protest of the judge 's decision , defense lawyers @entity19 and @entity21 asked to withdraw			1
pressure : @entity3 looks at her family during the penalty phase of her murder trial at @entity30 in @entity31 on monday			1
no witnesses are speaking in her defense the judge promptly denied that request			1
the defense then said they have no plans to call any witnesses , sending the court into recess as lawyers worked to resolve the next step			1
they later decided @entity11 would speak to the jury on tuesday			1
@entity11 and an ex-boyfriend had been expected to speak to jurors before the panel begins deliberating whether to sentence the 32 - year - old @entity11 to life in prison or execution for murdering her lover in 2008			1
@entity11 was convicted of first - degree murder earlier this month in the death of @entity3			1
last week , jurors heard tearful comments from @entity59 's brother and sister as they described how his killing has torn their lives apart			2
judge @entity63 instructed jurors they could consider a handful of factors when deciding what sentence to impose , including @entity11 ' lack of a prior criminal record and assertions that she was a good friend , had an abusive childhood and is a talented artist			2
in opening statements , prosecutor @entity74 told the panel none of those factors should cause the jury to even consider a sentence other than death , given the brutal nature of the killing			2
defense attorney @entity19 explained to jurors that @entity11 herself would testify this week			1
discussions : judge @entity63 meets with prosecutor @entity74 , left , and defense attorneys @entity86 and @entity19 , right , after denying a motion for mistrial ' when you understand who ms @entity11 is , you will understand that life is the appropriate sentence , ' @entity19 said			1
@entity11 , 32 , acknowledged killing @entity59 at his suburban @entity31 home on june 4 , 2008			0
she initially denied any involvement and later blamed the attack on masked intruders			0
two years after her arrest , @entity11 said she killed @entity59 in self - defense			2
the victim suffered nearly 30 knife wounds , had his throat slit from ear to ear and was shot in the forehead			0
prosecutors say the attack was fueled by jealous rage after @entity59 wanted to end his affair with @entity11 and prepared to take a trip to @entity111 with another woman			0
jurors convicted @entity11 on may 8 of first - degree murder , with all 12 unanimously agreeing it was premeditated , after about 15 hours of deliberations over four days			0
the panel later took less than three hours to determine the killing was especially cruel , meaning the death penalty would be a consideration for sentencing			0
the ongoing penalty proceedings will be the final phase of the trial			2
jurors are expected to begin deliberating @entity11 ' ultimate fate this week			0
the proceedings will play out like a mini-trial as the prosecutor will be allowed to cross-examine each witness , and both sides will offer closing arguments before the jury begins deliberations			0
under @entity140 law , if the jury can not reach a unanimous decision on sentencing , the panel will be dismissed and jury selection will begin anew			1
lock down : the cell of convicted killer @entity3 at @entity144 where she awaits the outcome of the death penalty phase of her trial another panel would then be seated to hear arguments in only the penalty phase to determine a sentence			1
if the second panel can not reach a unanimous agreement , the judge will then sentence @entity11 to either her entire life in prison or life in prison with the possibility of release after 25 years			0
the most anticipated part of the penalty phase will be when @entity11 takes the witness stand , though exactly what she will say remains a mystery			0
within minutes of her murder conviction , @entity11 complicated efforts for her defense when she gave an interview to @entity175 affiliate @entity174 , saying she preferred death over life in prison			2
it was n't clear whether the prosecutor would use those words against her in court , given some experts say it might not work in his favor aimed at securing a death sentence			0
' @entity3 has proven herself to be a conniving manipulator so she may be saying something like this to get a reaction from the jury , ' said @entity194 criminal defense lawyer @entity193			1
' she may be hoping the jury says , '' we wo n't give her what she wants , and if she wants death , we 're giving her life			0
'' ' @entity193 noted that in @entity11 ' case , with so much evidence against her , the defense can still claim some level of satisfaction is they can just keep her off death row			2
@entity140 defense attorney @entity210 , who has handled dozens of death penalty cases , said @entity74 may not need to mention @entity11 ' comments in the television interview to jurors given they have n't been sequestered throughout the trial			1
' they just ca n't avoid it , ' @entity210 said			0
' if they 're at a bar or a restaurant , they 're going to see and hear things			0
' arias also can not choose the death penalty			0
it 's up to the jury to determine a sentence			0
and while death penalty appeals are automatic in @entity140 , she could choose not to pursue additional appeals if she indeed wanted to die for her crime			1
earlier this week , after @entity11 ' was interviewed post-conviction , her attorneys asked to be allowed to step down from the case , but a judge denied the request			0
legal experts say the decision was not a surprising one because the attorneys have a conflict of interest with their own efforts to try and save her life while @entity11 has said she 'd rather die			0
the motion to withdraw will have no impact on the penalty phase of the trial given jurors are not privy to the filing .			2

no witnesses will speak in defense of @entity3 at her @entity140 trial
