a notorious thief dubbed the ' @entity1 ' because he crawled on his stomach to avoid infra - red alarm systems has been jailed for four - and - a - half - years			1
@entity4 , 47 , carried out a string of burglaries across the @entity8 area by wriggling along the floor to avoid activating the alarms			1
during his spree between march 2013 and may last year , he targeted five pubs in @entity8 and one in @entity14 , @entity15 , stealing £ 7,000 from fruit machines and causing £ 5,840 worth of damage			1
@entity4 , 47 , from @entity18 , carried out a string of burglaries at pubs across the @entity8 area by wriggling along the floor ( pictured ) of each premise to avoid activating the infra - red alarm system during his spree between march 2013 and may last year , @entity4 ( shown in @entity24 ) targeted five pubs in @entity8 and one in @entity15 , stealing £ 7,000 from fruit machines and causing £ 5,840 worth of damage among those pubs targeted were @entity29 , the @entity30 and @entity31 in @entity18 , @entity32 in @entity33 and @entity34 in @entity35 , @entity8			1
@entity4 , of @entity18 , was sentenced at @entity36 to four - and - a - half years in prison today after pleading guilty at an earlier hearing to burglary			1
the court heard how he would use his belly to slither along the floors of various pubs to get to the gambling machines			1
after staking out each pub to assess the alarm system , @entity4 - occasionally with an accomplice - would cover the cctv cameras of the targeted premises with plastic bags before returning at night			1
he would then either completely remove windows with a crowbar or smash through so he could enter and wriggle his way across the floor to the fruit machines			1
he had realised that if he remained below the ' line of sight ' of burglar alarm beams that he could remain undetected			2
@entity4 was eventually caught when police spoke to his girlfriend @entity59 and she admitted he would leave the house carrying a rucksack and tools and return with a large amount of coins			1
when he poured out £ 1,000 in coins in front of her , he told her to tell police that ' it was her savings ' if they asked about it			2
@entity70 , prosecuting , said : ' the aim of the burglaries was to target fruit machines , which were typically forced open and emptied of cash			1
' the burglaries were in the early morning when the public houses themselves were less likely to be occupied and the machines more likely to be full			1
' in the majority of the cases , although the public areas were empty , the homes above , within the same buildings , were occupied by the landlords or tenants			0
' the offender or offenders would be seen to be wearing gloves and face coverings of various sorts and carrying bags			0
' on a number of occasions cctv cameras were covered with bags in advance			0
@entity4 ( pictured ) , had already clocked up 181 previous convictions when he carried out the nine raids			1
he was sentenced at @entity36 to a four - and - a - half year prison sentence today ' the modus operandi involved crawling or sliding through pubs below the ' line of sight ' of alarm system beams and then turning machines to shield the thief from the beam picking him up and triggering the alarm			1
' one pub , the @entity30 , near @entity18 , was burgled on three separate occasions			0
during the first raid on november 11 2013 , @entity4 was caught on @entity24 climbing a drainpipe and covering the @entity24 camera with a plastic bag			2
the window frame was then removed from the back door and , while an accomplice waited outside , @entity4 crawled around all three fruit machines and broke into them			1
he also attempted to steal alcohol from behind the bar which set the alarm off at 5.30am			2
following an hour in the pub , @entity4 made off with £ 1,100 and caused £ 280 of damage			1
he later targeted the @entity123 in @entity124 , @entity15 , where more than £ 400 was stolen from a fruit machine			2
he was later chased by police during his getaway			0
mr @entity70 said : ' two males were seen walking to the train station and boarding the train at around 6am , one being this defendant			0
' the train from @entity14 to @entity8 was stopped by @entity133 but @entity4 pulled the emergency cord and managed to escape			1
' recovered on the train in a bag was brandy , charity sweets , £ 21 from the charity box , crisps and around £ 350 in cash from the fruit machine as well as tools and gloves			2
' mr @entity70 added that the morning after each burglary @entity4 would deposit large amounts of money into his @entity149 bank account in @entity150 - via a machine used for counting large quantities of coins and change			1
the @entity32 pub in @entity33 , @entity8 ( above ) was among those targeted by @entity4 in a statement read to the court , @entity157 , the landlord of the @entity30 pub , said he felt ' frustrated , angry and victimised '			1
' i felt helpless that he kept doing this , ' he added			0
@entity163 , the landlady of @entity34 in @entity35 , @entity8 , said : ' i 'm angry , upset and frustrated			2
angry that he feels it is okay to break into our home like this			0
' we now have extra security and we 're so upset the charity box was stolen			0
this type of crime is the lowest of the low			0
' in mitigation , defence counsel @entity173 said : ' there is no trauma to any victims beyond the inevitable			0
' overall there is limited damage and disturbance			2
perhaps it is no surprise to learn he has a history of addiction to @entity187 drugs			0
the addiction stems from issues from his childhood in the care system			0
' the court heard how the serial burglar had already clocked up 181 previous convictions			0
he first got into trouble at the age of 11 and was first locked up at the age of 14			0
sentencing @entity4 , the judge mr recorder @entity198 said : ' the burglaries follow a very general and specific pattern			1
you target the place in the early hours of the morning with relatively sophisticated planning to obscure the cctv cameras , then either break or remove from the window the glass and slide across the floor to avoid detection			2
@entity163 , landlady of @entity34 in @entity35 , @entity8 ( pictured ) said she was ' angry , upset and frustrated ' that @entity4 had broken into her premises and stolen cash from the fruit machine and charity tin ' you then move the fruit machine to deflect the security beam and take the contents of the machine , and it seems , on other occasions , you have taken items including alcohol , crisps , sweets and small items of cash from charity or staff tips			1
' you acknowledge that what you have done is completely wrong and you know you will be sent to prison			0
i do have regard to your difficult childhood which has led to a cycle of behaviour which has been described as " self - sabotaging "			0
' i know from experience in this court and outside that it is possible to break free from this behaviour even while in prison and there are signs of encouragement			0
' before this period you went for over one year without offending which may not sound a long time but given your background that was significant			0
' i urge you to take every opportunity available to you to see if you can break free			0
' following the sentencing , detective constable @entity246 said : ' thankfully , we received information he had been involved in a burglary using the same tactic and we managed to link him with the remaining crimes			0
' @entity4 thought he was being clever and was getting away with it but it goes to show that crime does not pay and you will be brought to justice eventually			2
