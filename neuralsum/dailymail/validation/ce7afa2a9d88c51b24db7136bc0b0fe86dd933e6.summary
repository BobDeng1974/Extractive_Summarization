@entity0 has backtracked on plans to develop a cheap flights to @entity3 - just days after it said it had received approval from the board			1
on monday , the budget airline had announced plans to run transatlantic services between key @entity10 cities and the @entity3 with one - way tickets costing from as little as £ 10			1
but today , bosses have been forced to admit the carrier is not about to move into long - haul flights			1
' in the light of recent press coverage , the @entity26 wishes to clarify that it has not considered or approved any transatlantic project and does not intend to do so			0
' the sudden u-turn came after @entity0 unveiled its plan to operate budget flights to the @entity3 within five years			1
the idea was part of an aggressive growth strategy , connecting airports such as @entity37 and @entity38 with @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41			0
in a statement carrier had said it was talking to manufacturers about buying planes to serve new routes between various @entity10 airports and 12 to 14 @entity3 cities			1
@entity49 previously said the airline has long been looking at long - haul flight plans , but is held back by a lack of aircraft availability ' @entity10 consumers want lower cost travel to the @entity3 and the same for @entity3 coming to @entity10			1
we see it as a logical development in the @entity10 market , ' a spokesman said on monday			2
' the business plan is there but it 's dependent on attaining viable long haul aircraft and we estimate that 's 4 to 5 years away			0
' @entity0 pilots had to wear oxygen masks as they made an emergency landing in @entity68 on thursday after a fire extinguisher went off in the cockpit			2
passengers said the pilot and first officer were unable to breathe without the masks as halon - a liquefied , compressed gas - filled the confined space as the plane flew from @entity37 to @entity78			0
tv presenter and professional sailor @entity79 said that passengers suspected there was a serious problem , but they did not know the reason for the emergency landing until they arrived at @entity85			0
fire trucks greeted the @entity87 when it touched down shortly after 10:15am local time as passengers began to grasp the nature of the emergency			0
@entity0 described it as a ' minor fault '			2
the airline first mooted the idea of offering transatlantic flights back in 2008 and board approval comes after the airline has invested 18 months in cleaning up its image and improving customer service			1
last year , @entity49 , the airline 's chief executive , told the @entity103 conference in @entity104 that @entity0 would offer the $ 15 flights to @entity40 and @entity39			1
however , he admitted that passengers would pay extra for everything from meals to baggage			0
he said : ' we can make money on 99 cent fares in @entity10 ' not every seat will be ( $ 15 ) of course ; there will also need to be a very high number of business or premium seats			2
' in a separate conversation , mr @entity49 admitted : ' we 've had a business plan ready to roll for a transatlantic , low - fares airline			0
' the difficulty is , i keep cautioning , is that there 's no availability of long - haul aircraft for another four or five years			0
' @entity0 is n't the only airline to consider offering budget transatlantic flights			1
previously , sir @entity130 launched @entity131 in the late seventies to offer ' no frills ' flights to the @entity3 , but his carrier @entity135 failed in 1982			2
@entity136 tried a similar concept in 2002 but was forced to file for bankruptcy in 2008			0
sir @entity130 revolutionised air travel with his idea for budget flights between @entity10 and the @entity3 , but his airline failed in 1982 more recently , @entity143 launched its own budget flights between @entity145 , @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity146 from as little as £ 389 ( $ 415 ) return			1
