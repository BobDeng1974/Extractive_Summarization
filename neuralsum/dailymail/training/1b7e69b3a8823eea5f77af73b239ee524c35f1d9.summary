the new offenses have stopped a total of 5,472 since the regulations , which clamp down on bad driving habits , were instituted in august last year			1
now , accelerating through a puddle or mounting the pavement could cause you on - the - spot fines of Â £ 100 or even three penalty points on a license , which can be reduced by taking a safe driving course			1
the new driving laws specifically target those who are driving inconsiderately towards their fellow drivers and pedestrians , but are not as severe as drink driving or speeding			1
nevertheless , they still come with hefty fines and the possibility of points , depending on the severity among the offences , grouped under the ' inconsiderate driving ' law , are driving too close to the vehicle in front , failing to give way at a junction and overtaking and pushing into a queue of traffic			1
more offenses include being in the wrong lane and pushing into a queue on a roundabout , lane discipline , such as needlessly hogging the middle or outside lanes , inappropriate speed , wheel - spins , handbrake turns and other careless manoeuvres			0

some of the police forces chose not issue penalty points , instead dealing with cases with traffic offence reports and re-education			0
five forces - @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity93 - @entity92 , @entity94 and @entity95 - are not stopping inconsiderate drivers at all because they do not have the facilities to offer the education course			2
