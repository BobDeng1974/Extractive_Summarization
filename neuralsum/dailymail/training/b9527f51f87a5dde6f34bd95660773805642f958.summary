by @entity0 , mail online deputy political editor @entity3 councils minister @entity2 admitted this morning that he had ' mixed memory ' over what he could and could not recycle at home minister for local councils @entity2 was forced to admit this morning that even he is so baffled by recycling rules he did not know what he could put in his green waste bin			1
the @entity3 mp - who is responsible for the @entity14 and @entity15 local authorities which set the complicated recycling rules - said the key to helping people recycle was to ' keep things simple '			1
mr @entity2 , the mp for @entity20 , said his local council in @entity22 was ' pretty clear about what you can and ca n't recycle ' - but then had to admit he did not know the rules himself			1
he told @entity27 presenter @entity26 that he was allowed to throw yoghurt pots in the recycling in @entity20			1
the top @entity3 , who was a council leader for five years , said he was ' sure ' he was allowed to recycle yoghurt pots and butter contrainers			1
but he was later forced to admit this was wrong and that his wife had had to correct him			2
mr @entity2 said he had a ' mixed memory '			0
it came after the mr @entity26 asked him on tv this morning : ' where you live , can you put yoghurt pots in your recycling ? mr @entity2 said : ' yes we can actually			1
' but the presenter responded : ' do you know that for sure , i ’m not trying to catch you out , it is just , the practicalities are the things that trouble people most , and you know that for sure do you , you know absolutely you can put yoghurt pots , butter containers for example , the different types of plastic , you know which one you can and which one you ca n’t for your own area			1
' the @entity3 minister said : ' yes and to be fair my council which is @entity20 are pretty good at educating people and making people very clear about what they can and ca n’t recycle			1
' mr @entity2 then went on @entity61 , to say that he had been on @entity27 talking ' about waste collection '			0
he said : ' need to be easy and regular for residents			0
' he then tweeted a link to the @entity20 recycling rules ' for clarity '			1
but the rules state : ' no plastics other than bottles ( yogurt pots , food containers , film / bags etc need to go in your grey bin )			1
' @entity27 then wrote on @entity61 : ' seems recycling is confusing			2
minister @ brandonlewis said he could recycle yogurt pots , but has since admitted he got it wrong			2
' ' @entity79 says you ca n't recycle yogurt pots etc. ' mr @entity2 then responded to say he had got confused - and had been ticked off by his wife for getting it wrong			1
he claimed he had a ' mixed memory '			2
he said : ' yep , wife already corrected me too , mixed memory re yogurt vs plastic bottles which are ok , confirms point re # keepitsimple			2
' families are often left baffled by which bins to use for their rubbish			0
in @entity95 , pictured here , people had to cope with nine different recycling bins mr @entity2 later said his confusion proved why councils needed to keep things simple			0
he said the councils needed to make things ' really easy ' for people			0
mr @entity2 said : ' my experience is the best way to get recycling up is to make it really easy for people to do it			0
' ' we spend about £ 122 a month on council tax and the main thing for them is to collect our rubbish and we expect a really good service			0
' over the last 10 or 15 years councils have moved away from weekly collections and tried to force people to recycle by having less than a weekly collection and it does n’t work			0
' people need to understand and we need to make it easier for people to recycle			0
' councils can choose how they provide their services - that is an important part of localism - but they should go for the easiest ways of recycling			0
' mr @entity2 appeared on the show over claims more than 100,000 tonnes of ' contaminated ' recycling ended up in landfill last year , despite families carefully sorting their rubbish at home			2
a @entity133 source said : ' it ’s important to recycle our waste properly but it appears the minister responsible has no idea what he ’s doing himself			1
' but mr @entity2 said : ' as you saw this morning recycling yogurt pots and other household waste can be a complicated and confusing matter			2
this government is working with councils to make it as easy and accessible as possible			0
' all the evidence suggests that when recycling is simple , more people do it , which is better for the environment and reduces long term pressure on landfill sites			0

@entity3 said he was ' sure ' he could recycle yoghurt pots at home in @entity20
claimed his council were ' pretty clear about what you can and ca n't recycle '
but rules say he can not put any plastics in the recycling other than bottles
minister **'s** wife ticked him off over blunder after tv appearance this morning
@entity133 say more recycling crucial but minister has ' no idea what he **'s** doing '
