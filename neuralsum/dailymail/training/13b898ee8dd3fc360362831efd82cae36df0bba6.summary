it seems impossible to talk about @entity1 at the moment without the conversation leaning towards @entity4			1
@entity5 , for one , must be pleased			2
for the last week the talk has been about @entity4 ’s long - term future at @entity8			1
now it ’s his immediate prospects — those of playing in the @entity11 — that have become pertinent			2
the bigger picture at @entity1 , though , relates to something @entity4 said not about himself last week but about his team			1
@entity4 's future has been the subject of much speculation with his contract up next summer @entity4 has been linked with moves to @entity21 and to @entity22 but is expected to stay at @entity8 @entity1 boss @entity23 greets his out - of - form striker @entity5 ahead of the @entity11 clash 54 goals scored in all competitions this season			1
that ’s far more than the rest of @entity32 ’s heavyweights : @entity33 ( 39 ) , @entity34 ( 38 ) , @entity22 ( 30 ) , @entity35 ( 30 ) , @entity36 ( 29 )			2
@entity1 have scored only 19			1
11 number of different goalscorers in the squad this season			2
@entity40 leads the way with 22			1
76.5 % @entity43 ’s win percentage this season			1
they have won 13 of their 17 games			2
3.2 @entity43 average more than three goals a game this season			1
@entity51 ’s 4 - 0 demolition of @entity52 at the weekend was their 11th consecutive win in all competitions			2
18 the @entity56 champions are undefeated in 18 home @entity58 ties , winning 16 and drawing two			2
they have scored 56 goals in those games			0
1,287 days since @entity43 ’s last @entity58 loss at the @entity11 — a 2 - 0 defeat by @entity36 in the semi-finals in april 2011			1
‘ i think by the end of the season there will have been a couple of exciting things [ happening ] for this team , ’ @entity4 told @entity66			0
‘ you have to have that belief and i have			0
i know we have a winner in charge			0
he is a winner and he is evolving this team			0
the new signings will grow and get better			0
’ it is perhaps this improvement , rather than news of a new @entity4 contract , that followers of @entity1 are waiting for most keenly			1
nobody really thinks @entity4 will be allowed to leave @entity8 next summer			1
whether manager @entity23 can restore @entity1 to somewhere near last season ’s levels , meanwhile , would appear to be in greater doubt			1
they approach tuesday 's game against the @entity56 champions in peculiarly uncertain fettle			0
having lost last season ’s keystone , @entity98 , in the summer , too few of the players recruited in his wake are currently in @entity23 ’s first team			0
despite the rhetoric — the talk of a ‘ positive ’ opening — @entity1 were pretty much humbled by @entity51 in losing 3 - 0 at @entity8 two weeks ago			1
since then there has been no improvement in the @entity108 and no goals			0
a stalemate at home to @entity112 was notable for a rare clean sheet , but saturday ’s defeat at @entity115 came on the back of another dreadful goal and an absence of the high - tempo , pressing football that @entity23 insists must be part of his team ’s dna			0
@entity23 oversees @entity1 's final training session as they bid to stop @entity43 completing the double @entity126 ( centre ) will be crucial to @entity1 's chances of completing a shock in @entity43 @entity130 limbers up as he ponders the challenge that lies in wait for @entity1 on tuesday something appears to be very wrong at @entity1 and an away fixture at perhaps the most powerfully destructive club side in the world right now would appear to be the last thing they need			1
‘ we see this is an opportunity rather than a threat , ’ countered @entity23 on monday			0
‘ it ’s a wonderful arena , one of the most iconic football grounds in the world			0
it ’s a challenge but opponents like this should help you return to your best			2
‘ we are n’t coming here expecting to lose and then see the other games as the chance to qualify			0
we are here for a result			0
’ as odd as it sounds , @entity1 could go home on the end of a hiding tonight and still qualify for the knockout stages			1
an injury - time winner for unfancied @entity158 against @entity159 a fortnight ago could yet prove the most important goal of @entity1 ’s season , affording them the chance to lose tonight but win their final two group games and go through as a distant second in a rather one - sided group			1
for @entity23 , though , the bigger picture remains complex			0
he spent heavily on players such as @entity168 , @entity169 , @entity172 , @entity170 and @entity171 during the summer but has so far had almost no return on that			2
despite the fuss over @entity5 and now @entity4 , that is the most relevant narrative of @entity1 ’s season so far			1
if @entity1 are to come again this season — if they are to prove they were n’t simply @entity98 and 10 others last term — that must change quickly			1
on monday , @entity23 did n’t sound as though his team were about to climb that hill any time soon			0
‘ it will take time unfortunately , ’ he said			0
‘ the [ young ] age and adaptation time is something we have to think about			0
we are not at the level we would like to be but we have to find a way to get our energy back into the game			0
‘ we have spent an awful lot of money on players to come in and give them an opportunity to perform			0
if at the end of this cycle of games they have n’t performed , they can never say they have n’t been given a chance			0
‘ whether it is @entity43 , @entity115 or @entity34 , i am putting my faith in these players to perform			1
’ @entity40 is in blistering form ahead of @entity1 's return visit to the @entity11 @entity207 ( right ) is expected to play some part in the match having missed the @entity8 clash through injury @entity40 , @entity212 and @entity213 train ahead of @entity43 's clash with @entity1 @entity43 ’s form is ominous			1
@entity217 ’s team have won their last 11 games and scored 24 times in their last six			0
that ’s 17 more than @entity1 over the same period			1
it appears a complete mismatch and @entity1 must show enormous improvement from the first leg if they are to compete			2
it is true that @entity23 ’ team began well in the first fixture two weeks ago but they crumbled on the back of @entity40 ’s opening goal in the 23rd minute			1
the reason for that the usually erudite @entity1 manager is yet to articulate .			2

@entity1 face an *unenviable* task against @entity43
the @entity237 giants have been *unstoppable* in recent weeks
@entity1 were soundly beaten at @entity8 last month
@entity207 will return to a side *boasting* @entity40
