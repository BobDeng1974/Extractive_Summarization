@entity1 leader @entity0 has been seriously injured in an air strike and is no longer in control of the terrorist group , according to an @entity6 source			1
the source said that he was wounded by an attack from the @entity9 - led coalition while travelling in a three - car convoy in march in @entity11 , @entity6			1
at first his chances of survival were deemed by his lieutenants to be low , but he pulled through			0
he is slowly recovering but does not have the reins of the organisation , according to @entity25			1
two officials confirmed to the paper that the strike on the convoy did indeed take place , on march 18 in the @entity32 district of @entity11 , not far from the @entity34 border			1
one , a @entity36 diplomat , told the paper that @entity39 generals were n’t sure whether @entity40 was in the convoy			2
news of the attack follows contradictory accounts of @entity40 being killed in air strikes in november and december another , an @entity6 expert on @entity1 used by the government in @entity49 in an advisory capacity , revealed that he had in fact been wounded			1
he said : ‘ yes , he was wounded in @entity32 near the village of @entity54 on 18 march with a group that was with him			1
’ this area is known to be largely lawless and a hotbed of jihadi activity , with very little @entity39 air presence			2
@entity61 , director of international security studies for defence think tank the @entity65 , told @entity66 that it ’s entirely plausible that the infamous leader had been hit , but warned that it might not have a long - term impact on the group if he did n't survive			1
he said : ‘ we ’ve heard these stories before			0
it 's possible , as they would be going after him and they would be trying to drone him , but it ’s right to be suspicious			0
' if he was killed it would have a big effect on the group as a lot of the group is wrapped up in his identity			2
the whole of @entity82 is built on success and if the leader is bumped off it ’s harder to say you ’re winning			0
‘ but it ’s quite a resilient group			2
they would do a pr piece on it and say he ’s gone to a better place – but coherence often comes from leadership			2
‘ however , it would not mean the end of the group by any stretch			0
’ last year there were two reports that @entity99 had been wounded , but they turned out to be inaccurate			0
he escaped death in december when @entity9 jets attacked a two - car convoy on the outskirts of @entity105			1
his close aide @entity106 was killed when a rocket fired from a war plane hit one of the cars			0
@entity0 was believed to be in the second car , which was not hit			0
figures from february showed allied airstrikes , including those carried out by @entity116 warplanes , had killed more than 6,000 fighters since september			0
the figure included more than half of the militants on the is ruling council			0
among the dead jihadists was also @entity123 , a former @entity6 army lieutenant colonel considered @entity99 ’s number two and the most senior is militant in @entity6			1
his death and that of as many as nine others on the 18 - man leadership council forced @entity99 to promote local warlords to the status of regional commanders , as his inner circle of trusted advisers and battle - hardened loyalists became increasingly small			2
@entity99 , 43 , was the head of @entity1 before founding the @entity82 in @entity6 in 2010 , while he was declared head of the @entity82 in @entity6 and @entity34 in 2013			1
in june last year , the @entity82 declared itself a caliphate , with @entity40 declared as its ‘ @entity140 ’ or ruler .			0

@entity6 source said he was wounded after his three - car convoy was attacked
air strike is thought to have taken place on march 18 near @entity34 border
he is slowly recovering but reportedly does not have reins of the group
