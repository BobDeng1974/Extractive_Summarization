on june 9 , 1942 , a speech was broadcast on the @entity1 that would change human history			1
@entity3 , @entity4 's prime minister exiled in @entity5 , revealed that 700,000 @entity6 had been systematically murdered in brutal @entity8 concentration camps , quarantined and executed en - masse in ghettos , and walked to their deaths in gas chambers			1
this was the first time the world and the allied forces had heard of the crimes of the @entity17 , a secret the @entity8 leaders had been able to keep until now			1
the information , a dossier of photographs and documents , had come to @entity5 from @entity4 via @entity23 , thanks to a group of @entity27 men who had risked their lives to tell the world about the @entity8 persecution of @entity4 jews forgotten hero : @entity32 , responsible for couriering the documents that would reveal the @entity17 and slaughter of 700,000 @entity4 @entity6 out of @entity35 , pictured with his @entity4 - @entity6 mistress @entity36 in the years after the war news of atrocities committed by the @entity8 occupiers in @entity4 had reached the @entity41 before @entity3 's speech , but never on this scale			1
@entity3 had even been advised by a fellow @entity4 politician to ' edit ' the number of @entity6 murdered by the @entity46 from 700,000 to 7,000 , as the number was to shocking to be believed			1
the information in @entity3 's speech would go down in history , but the man who got it there , a @entity27 businessman named @entity32 , all but forgotten			2
@entity32 , born in 1892 , head of @entity27 engineering company @entity53 in @entity35 , @entity4 when the @entity54 invaded in 1939			1
@entity32 and a group of fellow @entity27 expatriates working for corporations that would later become @entity58 and mobile phone giant @entity59 , were evacuated but later returned			2
death sentence : @entity62 ' @entity61 is photographed in the @entity64 prison in @entity65 after @entity66 sentenced him and four other @entity68 to death in 1943 , one year after their arrest brave : @entity72 was the executive director of @entity59 in @entity4 , the company that would later become mobile phone giant @entity59 hero : @entity74 , chief executive of @entity75 , later @entity58 , in @entity4 released : @entity76 , an engineer for @entity58 , and the three other @entity68 , were later pardoned and returned to @entity27 @entity32 and the @entity78 lived as comfortable as it was possible in occupied @entity35 ; electrics , phone lines and matches were , after all , goods and services the @entity54 had use of			1
most of the time was spent living in a bunker in the @entity88			0
@entity32 , by now in his late 40s , spoke @entity4 and was well liked by his staff			1
before the war , he had enjoyed hunts , collected @entity4 art , and had fallen in love with his secretary , a young @entity92 named @entity36 ' @entity98			2
soon , @entity32 and the others were witnessing increasing anti-semitic violence and oppression of the @entity4 jews			2
@entity32 was able to photograph the very first implementation of the law requiring @entity6 to wear a yellow @entity105 on their clothes , a practice which began in @entity4			1
he was later able to lie his way into the ghetto in @entity35 and took thousands of pictures of the horror within , before he was ushered out by a @entity6 policeman for his own safety			2
as the @entity46 escalated their persecution and harassment , friends and colleagues of the @entity68 were jailed or simply disappeared , and when @entity32 was approached by the @entity4 resistance army , he and the others decided to take a stand			1
travel in and out of occupied @entity4 was heavily restricted , but the men from neutral @entity27 could move across the borders , so became the perfect couriers for @entity125 - the @entity125			0
the @entity68 had been told by their employers in no uncertain terms than nothing was to be done that could anger the @entity54 occupiers			2
the @entity27 government wanted to avoid an invasion at all costs , and as a result , remaining neutral was paramount			0
moreover , the @entity78 knew that being discovered would lead to a certain death			2
despite this , @entity32 and his fellow @entity136 began transporting goods with secret compartments in which they had hidden documents , photo - negatives and money			2
@entity32 , working under the @entity144 ' , would become the most important connection between the @entity4 exile government in @entity5 and the resistance in @entity35			1
on may 16 , 1942 , the commander - in - chief of the @entity4 @entity125 , @entity149 , telegraphed to @entity5 : ' the @entity78 take a very irregular route ; still , they are fast and reliable and moreover can be entrusted with large deliveries			1
we can not allow them to be exposed			0
' just days later , on may 21 , @entity32 would take a very important suitcase with a hidden compartment from @entity35 to @entity23			0
it contained documents detailing the systematic slaughter of 700,000 @entity4 @entity6 by the @entity46 , including 2,000 photonegatives of @entity8 warcrimes in @entity4 , some taken by 51 - year - old @entity32 himself from inside the @entity35 ghetto			1
@entity32 , right , with fellow @entity163 , centre , and @entity166 's son , left , on a bird hunt in @entity4 in the mid- 1930s this picture was taken by @entity32 in october 1939 in @entity169 , where the law forcing @entity4 @entity6 to wear a yellow @entity105 on their clothes was first implemented by the @entity46			1
the @entity6 were also banned from using the sidewalks			0
the picture bears the sarcastic caption : the master race 's cultural endeavors in @entity169			0
even woman and children walk in the street in @entity169 with yellow marks on their backs ' a letter to @entity182 from @entity183 regarding the four @entity27 sentenced to death @entity3 held his @entity1 speech a week later , and it did not take long before @entity66 began rounding up the @entity68			1
' personally , i think the @entity54 listening in june 1942 grew worried and pissed off that the @entity1 was able to reveal in such detail exactly what was going on in @entity35 , and started to wonder how the hell the information had leaked , ' says @entity191 , author of @entity192 ( the @entity35 @entity27 - the men who let the world know )			1
' @entity66 did not have to be @entity195 to figure out that the @entity27 who travelled regularly between @entity35 and @entity23 could be involved			0
' seven @entity27 men ; @entity72 , @entity74 , @entity62 ' @entity61 , @entity76 , @entity197 , @entity198 and @entity199 were arrested by the @entity66 in july on @entity201 's order			2
he was in @entity23 , and his mistress , @entity36 , had been able to get a message to him that @entity66 was looking for him			0
as he was the main suspect , it is likely that she saved his life			0
@entity36 herself was also captured by @entity66 and taken to the @entity207 in @entity65			0
four of the men , @entity209 , @entity74 , @entity61 and @entity76 were sentenced to death in july 1943			0
however , all seven would return safely to @entity27			0
there are several theories why the four @entity68 were pardoned , and all are thought to have contributed to their final release in the autumn 1944			0
upon hearing that four @entity27 men had been sentenced to death in @entity8 , the @entity216 , @entity217 , wrote to @entity183 himself and asked that the @entity68 be released			1
@entity183 admired royalty , and in particular those in countries that he perceived to be the birthplace of the ' @entity225 ' race , and personally assured @entity217 that he would look into the matter in a letter sent at the end of july 1943			0
the documents @entity32 transported from @entity4 to @entity5 via @entity27 detailing the horror of the @entity8 concentration camps and the use of gas chambers were translated into @entity27 later in 1942 , but banned by the then - government so as to not upset @entity8 - @entity8 back in @entity35 : this photograph shows @entity163 , a @entity236 who worked for @entity59 , in front of a bombed out telephone box in @entity35 in the summer of 1945 it is also known that @entity201 's personal physical therapist , @entity240 , a man who has been credited with saving the lives of some 60,000 @entity6 from the @entity8 concentration camps , put in a good word with the @entity8 top brass			1
however , most importantly , @entity8 relied on neutral @entity27 to supply them with iron and ball - bearings for their weapons , and it is highly likely that the four @entity78 were kept as leverage , to ensure that @entity27 would fulfil their end of the weaponry bargain			2
' to their contemporaries , the @entity68 were no heroes , but a risk factor , ' mr @entity191 adds			0
' they had put @entity27 in danger through their efforts for the @entity4 resistance army and by raising the alarm about the @entity17			1
' a book based on the documents @entity32 transported to from @entity4 via @entity23 to @entity5 was published in @entity27 during the war , but every single copy was confiscated by the government before it even reached the shelves			1
the then prime minister , social democrat @entity267 , had personally ordered that the book , called ' a @entity4 black book on the @entity54 " @entity270 " in @entity4 ' , be collected from the publishers and banned			0
after the war , @entity32 had one priority			0
although @entity36 had lived as a @entity275 while in @entity35 , @entity66 uncovered her @entity6 heritage shortly after her capture , and she spent the remainder of the war in a part of the @entity64 prison reserved for @entity6			2
she survived her ordeal , and in 1945 , @entity283 and @entity32 could be reunited in @entity35			0
in his book about the @entity68 , mr @entity191 writes that @entity32 most likely saved her life through bribes passed via @entity58 's director in @entity8 to @entity201 's man @entity288			1
@entity32 divorced his wife , and the couple married in @entity27			0
@entity32 was later rewarded the @entity291 by the @entity4			2
in an interview with @entity4 historian @entity293 in the 1970s , @entity32 explained why he decided to risk his life to help tell the world about the @entity17			1
' during my entire life i was a businessman			0
i liked my job and i was good in my field			0
' i joined the struggle because i wanted to do something that was not for profit for once in my life			0

the ' @entity78 ' worked in @entity4 before and during @entity305
they helped the @entity4 resistance *smuggle* documents and information
@entity32 *smuggle*d the first proof of @entity17 in may 1942
the @entity1 told the world about @entity8 persecution of @entity6 weeks later
the @entity68 were arrested by @entity66 and sentenced to death
