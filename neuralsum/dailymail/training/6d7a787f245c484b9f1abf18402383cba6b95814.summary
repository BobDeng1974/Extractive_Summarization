the @entity28 obtained the emails on friday			0
@entity29 , who have subpoenaed for thousands of emails and went to federal court for access to the documents , have long promoted the idea that @entity1 knew that federal agents had engaged in a risky tactic known as ' gun - walking			1
' the @entity3 's inspector general found no evidence that @entity1 was aware of the tactic , in which @entity12 agents tried to track the flow of illegal guns from the @entity42 into @entity43 but instead lost track of many of the weapons			1
in one email from march 2011 , after being sent a news story about the @entity8 investigation , @entity1 told staff , ' i hope there is another side to the story			1
' @entity56 ' involved straw - buyers who sent 2,000 gus to @entity43 with help from the @entity12 , which hoped to track the firearms to drug cartels – but failed later , after the @entity12 deputy director told @entity1 aides that ' we did not allow guns to walk , ' @entity1 responded to staff with , ' do they really , really know ? ' that august , @entity1 was told by staff that a group of @entity42 attorneys was upset that the resignation of @entity72 , then the @entity42 attorney in @entity70 , was announced simultaneously with the reassignment of @entity12 acting director @entity74			1
@entity1 replied , ' some people can kiss my ass			2
' in another 2011 email @entity1 vented to colleagues about @entity81 congressional investigator @entity80 ' and his idiot cronies			0
' the angry remark appears in an email holder sent to his top deputies at the @entity3 , calling out the chair of the powerful @entity27			0
one was the murder weapon that killed @entity90 agent @entity8 in december 2010			0
the @entity1 email was part of a massive document dump that the @entity3 released on @entity94 as @entity42 were occupied with voting and watching , breath - bated , for results			1
' @entity97 ' : the depths of outgoing attorney general @entity1 's hatred for @entity81 @entity27 chairman @entity80 slipped out in an email just released little media coverage attended the cache , which amounted to 64,280 pages			1
the @entity3 had refused to turn over those documents , and more , since @entity80 's committee subpoenaed them in october 2011			2
@entity1 was later held in criminal @entity106 for refusing , making him the only presidential cabinet member in @entity42 history to wear that badge of dishonor			0
in the april 15 , 2011 email , @entity1 was responding to threats from @entity80 's committee staffers that they would issue subpoenas to force gun dealers – @entity116 ( @entity117 ) in government - speak – to tell what they knew			1
one @entity116 's attorney shared the back - and - forth with the @entity3			1
@entity121 , then the associate deputy attorney general in the office of the deputy attorney general , described the situation in an email whose subject line was ' possible subpoena for cooperating @entity116			2
' his attorney , @entity121 wrote , had ' told @entity80 ’s staff that his client has a variety of concerns with testifying , including the fact that he is a witness in a criminal matter and concerns for his safety			0
' @entity97 on the @entity138 : rep. @entity80 ( right ) presides over the powerful @entity27 , which has dragged @entity139 and @entity140 ( @entity12 ) officials to @entity142 to account for the scandal committee staffers , he added , ' told him that it would be easier to keep this confidential if he was willing to come in for a voluntary interview			2
counsel said that his client did n’t want to			0
' after @entity121 outlined the possibility that @entity80 might issue a subpoena forcing the gun dealer to testify , @entity1 's then - chief of staff @entity148 reached up the chain of command			1
' this keeps escalating , ' he emailed @entity1			0
that 's when his boss lost patience			0
' @entity80 and his idiot cronies never gave a damn about this when all that was happening was that thousands of @entity43 were being killed with guns from our country , ' he fumed in an email to @entity148 , deputy ag @entity167 , and @entity167 's chief of staff @entity169			0
' all they want to do – in reality – is cripple @entity12 and suck up to the gun lobby			2
politics at its worst – maybe the media will get it			0
' @entity8 weapons had already been turning up at the scenes of @entity43 gun crimes before @entity8 , the border patrol agent , was murdered			2
@entity180 : a @entity43 national killed @entity90 agent @entity8 with a gun that the @entity183 administration 's @entity3 allowed a straw - buyer to traffick south of the border no choice : @entity12 agents leaned on gun dealers in the @entity42 southwest to sell guns illegally in order to supply hte @entity8 program with weapons that could be sent into @entity43 @entity80 's investigation has uncovered evidence that a year before @entity1 's angry email outburst , some in the @entity12 sought to use the @entity8 program to build a case for a new gun control measure known inside the government as ' @entity202			1
' that plan was drawn up in order to use sales records from @entity56 - related purchases of large numbers of so - called ' long guns ' – rifles and shotguns designed to be fired while braced against the shooter 's shoulder – to force gun dealers everywhere to report the details of more of their sales to the federal government			1
it was so named because it was the third proposed regulation of its kind , in one july 14 , 2010 email the @entity27 has released , @entity223 assistant director @entity222 asked @entity225 , @entity12 's @entity226 special agent in charge , for help leveraging data from @entity8			1
' @entity225 – can you see if these guns were all purchased from the same ffl and at one time ? ' he asked			0
' we are looking at anecdotal cases to support a demand letter on long gun multiple sales			0
' the massive tranche of emails released tuesday , while the news media 's attention was fixed on election maps and poling - place results , were brought about by a series of events primed by a @entity245 request filed by @entity246 , the center - right watchdog group famous for wringing incriminating paperwork out of secretive bureaucracies			0
the @entity249 first reported on the @entity1 email criticizing rep. @entity80			0
after the @entity3 refused to comply with the @entity245 request , a federal judge ordered the government to release a ' @entity255 , ' a specialized inventory of all the documents it was withholding coupled with a rationale for each			2
many of those reasons seemed specious to the judge , who then ordered a similar disclosure to @entity80 's committee			0
@entity266 ? then - deputy attorney general @entity148 was @entity1 's point man on the ' gun - walking ' debacle the @entity3 , which has not commented on the @entity94 document dump , chose to voluntarily release everything on tuesday rather than face a judge 's order to do it on a slow news day			1
the flood of documents that reached @entity142 , the @entity27 claimed in a press release , ' is an admission that the @entity3 never had legitimate grounds to withhold these documents in the first place			0
' ' approximately two - thirds of the universe of documents that the @entity3 withheld from @entity283 has now been shown to be well outside the scope of @entity285			2
' @entity80 said in a statement that ' [ w ] hen @entity1 wants to know why he was the first attorney general held in criminal contempt of @entity283 , he can read the judge ’s order that compelled the production of 64,280 pages that he and president @entity183 illegitimately and illegally withheld from @entity283			1
' @entity1 tendered his resignation in late september but will stay on until the @entity294 can pick a successor who passes muster in the @entity297			2
