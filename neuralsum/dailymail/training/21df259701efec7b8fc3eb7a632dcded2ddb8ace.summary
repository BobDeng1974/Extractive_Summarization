by @entity0 mr @entity1 , 51 , a senior executive at @entity3 , and his daughter @entity4 were killed by the propellers a tv executive and his eight - year - old daughter were killed by their speedboat after he took the steering wheel from his wife and accelerated , catapulting the family of six into the water , investigators found			1
@entity1 , who had drunk some wine but was well below the drink - drive limit , had been steering but swapped places with his wife @entity17 – and detached the ‘ kill cord ’ which stops the power if the driver is thrown			1
she then took control without attaching the cord and was encouraged by her family to do another run around the @entity27 in north @entity28 , the official accident report said			0
mrs @entity29 had begun a slow , wide turn when her husband sitting next to her reached over , took the helm and opened the throttle of the 300hp engine to execute a tighter turn			2
the @entity37 rigid inflatable called @entity38 rolled violently , tossing the couple and their four children into the water			0
mr @entity1 , 51 , a senior executive at @entity3 , and his daughter @entity4 were killed by the propellers as the unmanned and out of control boat circled the family under full power			1
mrs @entity29 , 39 , lost part of a leg and their five - year - old son kit suffered ‘ life - changing ’ wounds in the accident off @entity55 last @entity56 weekend			0
the couple ’s two other children , @entity59 , 12 , and @entity60 , 11 , escaped with minor injuries largely thanks to water sports instructor @entity62 who jumped on board from his own boat and cut the power			0
‘ we sincerely hope that awareness of this accident will mean that another family does not have to go through anything similar			0
’ a report by the @entity85 ( @entity85 ) said : ‘ mr @entity1 who was in the co-driver position suggested that they should turn to starboard for another run			1
due to encouragement from the children and mr @entity1 she [ mrs @entity29 ] began a slow wide turn			2
‘ mr @entity1 then reached across in front of his wife , took the helm in his right hand and the throttle in his left , and then increased the engine throttle setting to full as he turned the helm to starboard			2
mrs @entity29 , 39 , lost part of a leg and their five - year - old son kit suffered ¿ life - changing ¿ wounds in the accident off @entity55 last @entity56 weekend ‘ the boat immediately accelerated and heeled into the turn and then suddenly and violently rolled back to port and ejected all its occupants out over the port side and into the water			2
the boat then continued to circle under full power			0
‘ the family were on the surface of the water , supported by their lifejackets and buoyancy aids , and the boat circled back towards them , striking several of them			0
’ the family from @entity126 , south - west @entity127 , own a £ 2million home in @entity129 , north of the exclusive @entity28 resort of @entity131			0
mr @entity1 bought the speedboat in 2012			2
at 12.25pm on may 5 last year the family boarded @entity38 at @entity131 and headed towards @entity134 before performing a number of laps around the bay at around 30 knots			0
he family from @entity126 , south - west @entity127 , own a £ 2million home in @entity129 , north of the exclusive @entity28 resort of @entity131 just after 2pm the family pulled into @entity55 where most disembarked for lunch while mr @entity1 remained on the boat and drank some wine			1
after lunch the family set out again with mr @entity1 at the helm and the cut - off cord attached			1
eight minutes later they stopped and mrs @entity29 took the helm , without attaching the kill cord			0
she was heading back towards @entity131 when they decided to do another ‘ run ’ up the bay towards @entity153 and the tragedy happened			0
investigators said both mr @entity1 and his wife had the relevant training to operate a powerboat and knew how to use a kill cord			1
mr @entity1 ’s alcohol level was well below the @entity163 ’s drink - drive limit			1
the report stated : ‘ the turn to starboard which led to the ejection was initiated by @entity29 but mr @entity1 almost immediately reached across his wife and took control of the helm			1
it is likely that he did this because he thought that a tighter turn to starboard was required to keep @entity38 clear of the beach on the @entity55 side of the estuary			0
‘ the manner in which mr @entity1 took the helm appears to have been out of character as he was known to be a safety - conscious and prudent individual			1
’ the @entity85 made a series of recommendations , including an urgent reminder for speedboat users to use kill cords at all times and to test them regularly			0
* the headline on yesterday ’s article about the inquiry into the tragic deaths of @entity191 executive @entity1 and his daughter @entity4 said he had been drinking before he took control of his speedboat			1
in fact , as the article itself reported prominently , the @entity85 found mr @entity1 ’s alcohol level was well below the @entity163 drink drive limit			1
we are happy to make this clear and apologise to mr @entity1 ’s family and friends for any distress the headline caused .			2
