@entity0 is set to launch a download service it claims could make the morning commute far more enjoyable			1
the @entity5 service , which launches next week , will allow people to download films and tv show to their phone or tablet			2
it puts @entity0 in direct competition with @entity15 's @entity14 services , and @entity17 's play store			0
the broadcaster said it expects the @entity5 to be popular with commuters the download service is an addition to @entity0 's @entity23 users simply find the programmes or film they want , and click the download button			1
it is then available on their device for 30 days , whether they have an internet connection or not			2
set to launch this week , the service will offer the ' majority ' of @entity0 's catalogue , and will cost £ 5 a month for users of the firm 's apps			1
blockbusters such as @entity37 , @entity38 : game of shadows and @entity41 in an adventure with scientists will all be available for download through the service , alongside the entire @entity47 film catalogue , containing all twenty - two official @entity47 films			0
@entity49 of @entity0 admitted the firm had been taken aback by the popularity of its @entity53 service , which allows people to watch its content on their phones and tablets			1
' there has been a massive shift in behaviour from consumers due to content on demand , ' he said			0
' it 's comparable to the introduction of live pause and rewind			0
' we 're connecting our customer 's boxes to the internet , and consumption habits shift dramatically - and it 's not all driven by the juggernaut of @entity76 , it shifts the shape of people 's viewing habits			0
' being connected drives extra value for us customers , and really help people watch whenever they want - this is really the final piece of the puzzle			0
' @entity0 also revealed what its customers are watching on ' catchup ' - with game of thrones being the most popular and ' boxsets ' using the new service , people can also choose to download either standard or high definition versions , and once downloaded , they have 30 days to watch			2
' people can download their favourite tv shows and movies , and watch them offline where they do n't have a 3g or wifi connection , ' he said			1
@entity0 believes the service will offer better value for money that services such as @entity15 's @entity14 , which charges users for every item they download - although users do then ' own ' the content , compared to @entity0 's subscription model			1
' people spend a lot of money buying content through @entity14 and other places to watch when they commute or are on a plane , so we think this is good value , ' said mr @entity49			0
the new app will run on @entity118 , iphones and selected @entity121 devices the new service allows people to download as many films and shows as they can fit on their device			2

@entity5 allows users to download tv shows and movies to watch when they do n't have an internet connection
