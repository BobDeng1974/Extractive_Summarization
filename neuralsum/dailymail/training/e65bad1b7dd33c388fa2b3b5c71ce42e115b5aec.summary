@entity1 ’s annual shareholders meeting becomes more frustrating by the year with the board now choosing which fans ’ questions they answer , while deflecting the contentious issues			1
so @entity1 ’s catering and cleaning contractors paying @entity9 workers less than the hourly @entity11 living wage was a matter for the government according to the club , who could easily deal only with companies which pay a @entity11 rate			1
and there was no detail about the exact advisory role carried out by owner @entity22 ’s company @entity21 , for which the club paid out over £ 3m			2
meanwhile , the reasons given for @entity22 ’s son @entity25 joining the board were his experience in leadership roles gained with various sports teams in the @entity30 — all owned by his father			1
and chairman sir @entity33 did n’t count the number of shareholders who voted against @entity25 joining the board , though it looked remarkably close to the amount in favour			0
@entity38 ( far left ) has joined @entity1 in an advisory role after working for clubs owned by his father sir @entity33 ( right ) has given @entity1 manager @entity41 his full backing ' on all football matters ' finally sir @entity33 brushed away a highly relevant question from respected horse racing figure @entity46 about @entity41 not buying a defender in the summer			1
@entity49 said the board gave the manager , who did n’t want to answer , 100 per cent backing on all football matters whether he had a plan or not			0
@entity54 mumbled a few platitudes as well as saying the shareholders summit was an ‘ unusual environment			0
’ there is increasing likelihood that the next @entity61 tv rights tender — to be unveiled around the @entity62 — will include an extra eighth package to show sunday night football , as revealed by @entity65			1
and the slot , which already has the informal support of the top clubs — well aware that it could add at least another £ 600m to their coffers — could easily become the most valuable			0
there will be problems over transport and further diluting the saturday afternoon programme but money always talks loudest in the @entity61			2
sunday night @entity61 matches could be shown on television in the near future the class of 92 have now become such a commercial entity that agency @entity81 , who represent @entity83 and @entity84 and @entity85 , are now acting for all five of the @entity87 group on some projects			1
@entity87 's class of 92 stars including @entity83 ( far left ) and @entity91 are hot property the @entity94 civil war over their botched rebuilding programme now sees various high - profile members including @entity97 , sir @entity98 , sir @entity99 , sir @entity100 and @entity101 seeking support for another @entity103 to pass a vote of no confidence in chairman @entity106			0
but the grandees ’ case is hardly helped by their other supporters , including members such as @entity112 , who agitated for a previous costly @entity103 which he did n’t bother to attend			0
@entity113 , @entity115 ’s @entity114 sports minister , is announcing his party ’s proposal to enable at least two fans to be on every football club board and have the right to purchase up to 10 per cent of the shares when a club changes ownership			2
@entity113 says the fanciful policy — seriously over-hyped as the ‘ biggest legislative shake - up in the governance of @entity128 and @entity129 football clubs since the advent of the game ’ — will form part of the election manifesto with legislation during the first term of a @entity136			0
at least @entity113 is making a statement about his intentions for football in contrast to useless @entity142 @entity141 , who has steered clear of football matters since a quiz ambush in which she could n’t name the @entity148 holders			0
minister for sport @entity141 did not know who the holders of the @entity148 were in november 2013 the weekend bestseller lists will show the biggest two book sales were for the @entity155 and @entity156 stories — not surprising given the publicity surrounding both publications			2
@entity155 ’s account sold around 21,000 hardback copies in its first week with @entity156 in second place with over 19,000			1
@entity155 seems to be enjoying promotional tours more than @entity156			2
the day after @entity164 gained a draw against @entity166 , @entity163 assistant boss @entity155 went down a storm addressing the @entity170 autumn sales conference			0
@entity155 has sold 21,000 hardback copies of his autobiography while @entity156 has sold 19,000			1

the @entity1 board *sidestepped* questions regarding @entity9 workers earning less than the hourly @entity11 living wage
@entity22 's son has joined board because of his experience at his father 's sports clubs
@entity61 games could start to be shown on sunday nights
