with a violent flash of teeth , this is the moment a wounded and starving jaguar tried to snatch a caiman from a @entity6 river in a last ditch effort to eat			1
but despite initiating the sneak attack , the cat slunk away empty - handed after the caiman successfully fought it off and swam to safety			1
the brutal fight to the death was spotted by a photographer , who watched the visibly unhealthy jaguar creep up on the caiman along the banks of the @entity19 , @entity20 , in @entity6			1
he said : ' we found this old female @entity30 who was in very bad condition with several visible wounds on her stomach possibly caused by a fight with another @entity30			0
' she looked in desperate need of a meal and was actively hunting along the river bank when she grabbed this caiman right in front of my boat			0
' unfortunately , the bold cat 's plan went awry with the caiman successfully slipping from her hold and hurriedly disappearing underwater			2
mr @entity25 added : ' there was a big splash and i took five pictures in about half a second , before the caiman escaped from her grasp and disappeared from view			0
' there are an estimated 4,000 - 7,000 jaguars in the @entity20 region , where they have evolved into specialist caiman killers and hunt during broad daylight			1
in recent years footage and photos have emerged of the predators launching sneak attacks on the caimans while they bask on riverbanks in the sun. however , in this instance , the cat actually jumped into the water to catch its prey - which is likely to show it was in desperate need of a meal			0
the jaguars found in the region are the largest and most powerful of the species in @entity78 , enabling them to take down larger prey			0
they have also become a tourist attraction because they can be regularly seen in broad daylight			2
elsewhere , jaguars are often hunted and tend to be shy and reclusive , making them much harder to see in the wild			0
with a flurry of violence , the jaguar launched itself from the shore and into the water , sinking its claws into the reptile 's belly the two animals wrestled for a few seconds as the jaguar tried to get a firm grip on its meal and drag it out of the water although the ambush at first looked to be successful , the attack was in vain - the caiman managed to break free and swim to safety			1

visibly starving jaguar attempted to ambush caiman by *pouncing* on it while it swam near the shore
but the caiman managed to successfully fight off the attack by *wiggling* free and swimming into *deeper* water
jaguars in the @entity20 , @entity6 , area have become a tourist attraction for their often *daring* attacks on caiman
