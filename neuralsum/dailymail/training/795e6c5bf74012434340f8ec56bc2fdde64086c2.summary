by @entity0 , mail online deputy political editor @entity4 terrorists fighting in @entity5 are ' planning to attack us here at home in the @entity8 ' , @entity2 said today			1
the prime minister told @entity10 that the crisis in the @entity12 must not be dismissed as ' nothing to do with us '			1
he said the jihadist insurgents in @entity5 , @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 would ' come back and hit us at home ' if the @entity8 did not help defeat them			1
@entity2 told @entity10 during prime minister 's questions that the threat posed by @entity23 militants was not confined to the @entity12			1
he said they were planning to turn their fire on @entity8 the damning warning came after former security minister @entity26 claimed @entity8 was sending more @entity4 extremists to @entity15 and @entity5 than any other country in @entity29			1
speaking in the @entity30 mr @entity2 said : ' i 'd disagree with those people who think this is nothing to do with us and if they want to have some sort of extreme @entity37 regime in the middle of @entity5 that wo n't affect us – it will			2
' the people in that regime , as well as trying to take territory , are also planning to attack us here at home in the @entity8			1
@entity26 has said more young men leave the @entity8 to become jihadis than anywhere else in @entity29 ' so the right answer is to be long term , hard - headed , patient and intelligent with the interventions that we make , and the most important intervention of all is to make sure that these governments are fully representative of the people who live in their countries , that they close down the ungoverned space , and they remove the support for the extremists			1
' if we do that , not just in @entity15 , but we have to help in @entity5 , in @entity16 , in @entity17 , in @entity62 , because these problems will come back and hit us at home if we do n't			1
' earlier , @entity26 warned there is a danger of ' a sufficient number ' of @entity8 citizens travelling to fight in @entity5 and @entity15 becoming radicalised against the @entity70 and returning ' with the intention of doing damage			1
' the former chairman of the @entity8 @entity74 said militants in the region posed the gravest threat to @entity8 today , as @entity5 's ambassador to the @entity79 warned @entity23 extremists could produce ' a thousand ' global terrorists like @entity82			1
@entity84 has said if the @entity79 and other nations focus too much on @entity5 's internal politics and ignore the ' immediate threat ' of a terrorist movement that 's gathering steam , the results will be catastrophic			1
speaking on @entity91 's today programme , @entity26 said there was a danger of ' real radicalisation ' if @entity8 citizens travelled to fight			1
she said : ' i think the danger lies in their desire to go , for whatever motive , and what happens to them when they are there , then that 's the danger of real radicalisation , coming back with skills and without any other activity in life and motive			0
' she warned a ' sufficient number ' could return to the @entity8 with the ' intention of doing damage			2
' the former @entity113 minister said : ' i think it 's entirely undesirable that any should go and indeed i think it may become an offence to do that			0
' @entity26 said : ' unfortunately , i think the @entity8 exports more young men to become jihadis in @entity29 than any other			1
' she went on to say : ' the intelligence picture is fairly clear			0
there 's no doubt the numbers are there and there is a real danger of these young men when they come back getting into serious trouble			0
' our ability to track what 's going on is infinitely greater than it was post 9/11 which i think is one of the reasons why we have n't seen the national alert rise			0
' @entity26 was asked whether young men with ' muddled views ' about fighting with @entity166 , when in @entity5 and @entity15 they would also be fighting against other @entity166 , should be regarded ' as potential radicals '			1
she said : ' i think we ca n't take the risk of this kind of thinking just brewing without any kind of antidote			0
' she suggested educating and providing young men with more information in the short - term , along with a longer - term process of better integration			0
mr @entity2 yesterday said the police service and spy agencies have been ordered to focus their efforts on the @entity4 insurgents , particularly those returning to @entity8			1
today 's warnings were backed by security expert professor @entity184 who said @entity8 will be ' haunted ' by the threat of terror for years to come			1
professor @entity184 , director of the @entity188 for the @entity189 , said the country faced a ' significant ' risk from a minority of those who joined groups such as @entity23 ( @entity23 )			0
he said : ' i think personally that it is a threat that will continue to haunt this country and other @entity29 and western countries for years to come			2
' even if @entity23 is pushed back from @entity5 , they are still going to exist			2
this is going to be keeping the security services and police busy for many years to come			0
' the @entity203 estimates that between 400 and 500 @entity8 have gone to fight in @entity15 , with many believed to have joined the ranks of @entity23			1
professor @entity184 said : ' up to about a week ago almost all of them were in @entity15 but we are now seeing reports of people crossing the border into @entity5			1
' it comes after @entity213 revealed more @entity8 citizens have signed up to fight in @entity5 and @entity15 than joined the @entity215 last year			1
ministers have been caught off - guard by the speed of the insurgency by the @entity23 ( @entity23 ) sweeping through @entity5 , with more evidence emerging of brutal executions			2
several hundred @entity8 have travelled to the region to join militants in fighting , but just 170 extra reservists enlisted over the past year			1
mr @entity2 yesterday insisted the prospect of battle - hardened jihadists returning to the @entity8 was a ‘ real threat to our country ’			1
mr @entity84 has warned of the dangers of the @entity79 and other nations focussing too much on @entity5 's internal politics and ignoring the extremist movement			2
' this is a global tumor in @entity5 taking place now and in @entity15 , ' he said , referring to the @entity124 militant group calling itself @entity23			1
' we 've seen it before			0
' @entity23 aims to establish a caliphate -- an @entity4 state that transcends national borders -- in areas of @entity15 and @entity5 , and it has captured at least nine cities in the two countries the @entity244 has scolded @entity246 's government in @entity125 for provoking @entity23 by alienating the country 's @entity124 minority			1
@entity249 said on friday that @entity79 military intervention would be conditioned on reconciliation efforts from @entity246 's @entity127 majority			0
' any action that we may take to provide assistance to @entity5 security forces has to be joined by a serious and sincere effort by @entity5 ’s leaders to set aside sectarian differences , to promote stability , and account for the legitimate interests of all of @entity5 ’s communities , ' @entity249 said in public remarks			2
' so this should be a wake - up call			0
@entity5 ’s leaders have to demonstrate a willingness to make hard decisions and compromises on behalf of the @entity5 people in order to bring the country together			2
' @entity26 backed prime minister @entity2 's comments that militants in @entity5 and @entity15 pose the gravest threat to @entity8 today but @entity84 suggested during an interview with @entity121 's @entity120 that @entity249 is naively fiddling while @entity125 burns			1
' these are all " nice to have " discussions , ' he said , but ' what we have in @entity5 now , to -- is an immediate threat			2
' ' but do you not feel this is an immediate threat ? ' @entity120 interrupted , ' that practically half the country feels disenfranchised ? the @entity124 ? ' ' we 're not saying we 're not happy to [ have a ] discussion , ' he responded			2
' we want to have that discussion			0
but we 're saying conditioning that discussion is not wise			0
making clear that we all stand together against a threat in global terrorism is the question			0
' ' let me give you an example			0
what you have in @entity297 , with one @entity82 – you will have a thousand of them			0
' ' no pows , ' he warned			0
' nothing , none of that			0
no rules of engagement but destruction			0
' ' that 's the situation in @entity5			2
' @entity249 told @entity307 on monday that he is sending 275 armed military men and women into @entity125 to protect @entity79 embassy personnel and assets as they are moved elsewhere in @entity5 and to @entity312			2
they will be ' armed for combat , ' the @entity244 said , while insisting that the ground troops wo n't be the first drop in an ocean of military entanglements of the sort that @entity249 campaigned against in 2008 and 2012			0
an administration official also said monday that the president is considering the deployment of a small contingent of @entity324 to @entity5 , specifically to help the @entity246 government slow the advance of @entity23			0
@entity249 is also mulling unilateral air strikes to hamper @entity23 , but administration sources told @entity213 on tuesday that the primary objection to that strategy is political , not tactical			0
the @entity332 , one source said , is concerned that forcing @entity23 off the battlefield now that neighboring @entity334 has sent 2,000 of its elite @entity336 forces to stabilize the region could effectively clear the way for @entity334 to seize oil fields and other lands in eastern @entity5 .			0
