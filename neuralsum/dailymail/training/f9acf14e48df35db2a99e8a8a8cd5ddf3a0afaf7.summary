there have been times in @entity3 ’s career when he has shown what a sentimental old fool he can be			1
he is a romantic at heart			2
this was the official homecoming for @entity8 , the first time @entity11 ’s supporters have seen him in their @entity13 jersey since that incredible night in the @entity14			1
after starting this game , he was blowing heavily for most of it in his struggle to recapture past glories			0
at 36 , it is too much to ask			0
@entity11 striker @entity8 jumps over @entity21 goalkeeper @entity20 two years ago , when @entity11 went on to win the @entity13 , @entity8 was the main man			1
he was king in these parts , then			0
that night , he summoned superhuman powers to score their equaliser against @entity25 in the 88th minute and went on to strike the winning penalty in the shootout			0
on wednesday night , as @entity11 fans heartily sang @entity31 ’s name after he was brought on with @entity32 in an attempt to snatch victory , it felt like the endgame for @entity8			1
@entity8 joins in the celebrations for @entity38 ' opening goal against @entity21 @entity39 had been willing him to score , but those legs could not carry him to the places his razor - sharp mind wanted to go			1
there were chances in each half as he attempted to add to the 34 @entity11 goals he has scored in this competition			1
the first was nicked off his toes for a corner			0
after the break , @entity50 , @entity11 ’s outstanding player in an ordinary performance , set him clear of @entity21 ’s defence			1
he beat keeper @entity20 , but rolled his effort wide			0
then there was the ‘ @entity62 moment ’ , sliding in like the @entity57 midfielder at @entity58 , when @entity59 crossed from the right			0
@entity64 , like @entity63 , failed to connect			0
‘ i was happy with @entity8 ’s performance , ’ insisted @entity3			1
‘ one inch is nothing , that is all			0
’ @entity69 backs @entity11 captain @entity70 as he protests against his booking for kicking the ball away to judge @entity8 on one start would be ridiculous , but the fact @entity3 reached for @entity31 and @entity32 17 minutes from time said it all			1
@entity11 ’s manager always looks out for his favourites			1
when @entity79 were 2 - 0 up with four minutes to play in the 2010 @entity13 final , @entity3 sent on @entity81 as a substitute			1
it was the @entity84 ’s reward for his loyalty during @entity3 ’s final season at @entity87			2
this was another emotional decision by @entity3 ahead of sunday ’s game at @entity91			2
@entity31 ’s place for that is nailed on			2
@entity8 makes way for @entity31 during wednesday 's 1 - 1 draw at @entity39 @entity8 was on his own up front , ahead of the playground footballers — @entity50 , @entity59 and @entity38 — who provide the attacking thrust			1
they have younger legs and danced around @entity21 in a dizzy opening spell			2
there were flashes from @entity8 , the silky touches that once turned this guy into one of the dangerous strikers in @entity109			0
the neat header to @entity38 , from a long ball by @entity70 , was the @entity8 of old			0
so was the backchat with @entity50 , after he took the ball off his toes when he should have peeled off him			0
when he was replaced by @entity31 , the chants were for the new man in town			2
undeniably , they have replaced an old favourite here .			0

@entity120 made first appearance in @entity13 jersey for @entity11 since 2012 triumph
@entity39 was willing him to add to the 34 goals he has in this competition for the @entity128
@entity3 reached for subs @entity31 and @entity32 17 minutes from time against @entity21
