@entity5 suffers from a life - threatening genetic disease called @entity7 which affects his vital organs and makes his skin unbearably itchy			1
the condition , which affects just one in 100,000 children , can not be cured - but a liver transplant would permanently ease the itching			1
@entity5 suffers from unbearable itching due to his syndrome , which causes a build - up of bile in his liver soon after @entity5 was born , he developed a rare form of jaundice , which kick - started his itchiness			1
after a year - long series of tests , specialists finally managed to diagnose him with rare @entity7 , which causes a build - up of bile in his liver , setting off the itching			1
it is believed only a liver transplant will be able to permanently cure his condition			1
the brave youngster has had 15 operations , including open heart surgery , but his immune system is so weak that he constantly picks up infections			0
@entity5 , of @entity39 , @entity40 , will be assessed next month by liver specialists from @entity42 in @entity43 to see if he is suitable for a transplant			1
his mother @entity45 , 40 , said : ' the itching is horrendous			1
it just gets worse and worse			0
' when he is itching he gets completely frustrated			2
no matter how much he scratches it never goes away			0
he throws things and lashes out			0
@entity5 had to wear a special suit as a baby to help stop him itching : his mother hopes a liver transplant can ease his condition @entity5 , with his mother @entity45			1
medications is used to improve bile flow @entity45 with her son @entity5			1
half of cases of @entity7 are inherited but half occur spontaneously ' it 's heartbreaking			0
when it 's really bad he stands at the top of the stairs screaming " mummy , help me " , with blood pouring from his legs or ears or wherever			0
' it 's in his nose , his ears , places he ca n't even scratch			0
he ca n't sleep and he ca n't stand the heat			0
alagille syndrome is a life - threatening genetic disorder that causes a loss of the bile ducts within the liver during the first year of life			1
this leads to a buildup of bile in the liver , causing damage to liver cells			1
scarring may occur and lead to cirrhosis in about half of affected children			2
symptoms including jaundice , loose stools and poor growth develop within the first three months of life			0
later , there is persistent jaundice , itching , fatty deposits in the skin and stunted growth			2
the disease can stabilise between four and 10			0
it affects around one in 100,000 children			1
children with the condition tend to have a prominent , broad forehead ; deep - set eyes ; a straight nose ; and a small pointed chin			1
treatment of @entity7 syndrome focuses on trying to increase the flow of bile from the liver			1
problems with fat digestion and absorption may lead to deficiency of fat - soluble vitamins ( a , @entity118 , @entity119 , and @entity120 )			2
deficiencies of these vitamins can be diagnosed by blood tests and can usually be corrected by large oral doses			0
occasionally , liver cirrhosis advances to a stage where the liver fails to perform its functions			2
liver transplantation is then considered			2
alagille syndrome is generally inherited only from one parent and there is a 50 per cent chance that each child will develop the syndrome			2
half of cases occur spontaneously			0
source : @entity139 ' he has got a vest , leggings , socks , mitts and a wee balaclava but he is still itching			2
' it comes in waves			0
he can have a few weeks without it , as it depends on the amount of bile , and when he is not itching he is fine			1
he is swinging from the lampshades			0
' he has got a great spirit			0
he is a right wee mischief			0
when i look at him it makes it all worthwhile			0
' i think they are going to have to transplant him			2
it wo n't cure the condition but it would stop the itching for good			2
' it is a hard decision but i think in the long run it will be better for him			0
the itching is the main problem he has with quality of life			2
' @entity5 prefers the cooler weather of winter as it soothes his itching			1
just before @entity174 he was treated to a trip to @entity176 , @entity177 , after a friend contacted the @entity179 on his behalf			0
the four - year - old loves @entity181 and said his dearest wish was to visit ' @entity184 land '			1
the family were put up in a luxury @entity188 hotel , went on lots of rides and met some of @entity5 's favourite characters			1
the youngster was also able to go swimming for the first time in three years			0
' @entity5 had a really magical time and he thinks @entity198 is his best friend now , ' ms @entity196 said			1
