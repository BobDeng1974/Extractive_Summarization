older people with lung cancer are much less likely to be given life - saving surgery than the young , it has been revealed			2
those aged 75 or over were five times less likely to have an operation even if they were in good health and their cancer had not spread			1
the research by @entity12 , with @entity13 and @entity14 , adds to mounting evidence of age discrimination in @entity18 treatment			1
missing out : those aged 75 or over were five times less likely to have an operation even if they were in good health and their cancer had not spread ( file picture ) experts say there are complex reasons why older patients may not receive surgery , including other serious health conditions or if the cancer has spread			1
but @entity33 , chief executive at @entity34 , said that is n’t the whole picture			2
assessment methods are often inadequate , he said , meaning that many older cancer patients ’ treatment is chosen based on their age alone , not their fitness			1
the charity also found older patients are more likely to have difficulties getting to hospital , or to decide not to have surgery			1
mr @entity33 said : ‘ i just can not comprehend why healthy older lung cancer patients are given less life - saving surgery than younger patients , despite the fact that many could survive for years afterwards			1
’ older patients are far more likely to survive if they have surgery , studies show			1
among the ‘ healthiest ’ over- 65s , two - thirds of those who have surgery are alive seven years later			2
just one in 70 of those who do not have surgery will live that long			0
a report this year found five - year survival rates for patients 75 and over in @entity58 and @entity59 are among the worst in @entity60 – 44 per cent worse for lung cancer patients			1
inequality : @entity63 , director of charity @entity64 , said the figures suggest there is still age discrimination in the @entity18 campaigners said older patients were ‘ written off as too old ’ by the @entity18			1
mr @entity33 said : ‘ it is deeply sad that our survival rates in this age group continue to lag behind @entity60			1
we should not send a message to older patients that it is okay to discriminate			1
‘ if we do n’t take heed of these figures now , things will get worse			0
‘ the @entity78 should match the best in @entity60 , not the worst			0
the @entity18 must ensure every older patient is treated based on their overall fitness , not their chronological age			1
’ @entity83 , from @entity84 , said her grandmother had experienced discrimination			2
the 32 - year - old said : ‘ my grandmother was 80 when she was diagnosed with lung cancer in 2007			0
it was n’t advanced as far as we were aware but all she was offered was a bit of radiotherapy			0
‘ she was given no support , and no effort was put into her care			0
i really do feel they saw her as an old woman and they were n’t going to bother much			0
she was shunted between health authorities who seemed reluctant to take responsibility for her , and died a year later in hospital after an emergency admission			2
’ @entity63 , director of charity @entity64 , said : ‘ this research once again demonstrates that older people can experience discrimination within the @entity18 and that the chances of receiving high - quality care are all too often stacked against them			1
’ she added : ‘ where a patient and their doctor agree that treatment for lung cancer , or any condition , would be safe and of benefit , they should be able to have it regardless of their age			1
decisions about who should and should not be given surgery should be based purely on clinical need – anything else is blatant age discrimination			1
’ around 38,000 people are diagnosed with lung cancer each year			0
in @entity14 , only 29 per cent of men and 33 per cent of women with the disease survive for one year			0
a large study found most women did not meet national guidelines for physical activity after their diagnosis exercise can help breast cancer survivors live longer – but two out of three are doing too little , researchers say			0
a large study found most women did not meet national guidelines for physical activity after their diagnosis			0
only 35 per cent of breast cancer survivors were doing at least half an hour a day of moderate activity , says research published online in @entity149 , an @entity151 journal			2
although the study was carried out in the @entity153 , @entity78 experts said survivors here need more support to increase and maintain exercise levels			0
the study assessed physical activity in 1,735 women aged 20 to 74 before and after they were diagnosed with breast cancer			0
the team led by @entity162 , of the @entity163 , found almost two - thirds of women were less active six months after diagnosis than they had been before			0
@entity167 said ways of getting women active should be ‘ comprehensively evaluated and implemented ’			0
in the @entity78 , 50,000 women and 400 men develop breast cancer each year			0
they are advised to do 150 minutes of moderate activity , such as gardening , dancing or brisk walking , or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise , including running or aerobics , every @entity174 research this year found exercising for an hour a day cut women ’s risk of breast cancer by 11 per cent .			2

research adds to evidence of increasing age discrimination in the @entity18
serious health conditions may cause patients to miss out on treatment
@entity12 say assessment methods are inadequate
