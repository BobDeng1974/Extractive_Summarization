@entity0 would be happy to switch to his old half - back role for @entity2 in the @entity3 but he expects @entity4 to claim the number six jersey			1
@entity0 is a certainty for @entity2 's opening match against @entity8 in @entity9 on saturday week but has come under pressure for his full - back spot from @entity13 ' @entity12			1
the former @entity15 favourite , who now plays in the @entity16 for @entity17 , has noted the form of @entity12 , who took his spot in the @entity20 this year , and welcomes the competition for the number one shirt			1
@entity0 ( left ) expects to face competition from @entity13 ' @entity12 ( right ) for @entity2 's full back jersey ' i 've seen a number of his games this year and he 's been brilliant , ' said @entity0 , who returned home when the @entity17 failed to reach the play - offs but will be on the plane to @entity9 with his @entity2 team - mates on tuesday night			1
' @entity12 's progressing the older he gets and he 's put himself in a great position			2
' he has obviously been outstanding this year and ( head coach ) @entity34 's going to have some tough choices to make i think			0
' but that 's good			0
it means every week we 're going to put a good team out			0
' with only two specialist half - backs in @entity34 's 24 - man squad , @entity4 is expected to partner @entity15 scrum - half @entity43 but @entity0 , who began his career as a stand - off , is ready to step in if required			1
' i 've not spoken to @entity34 about that , ' he said			0
' it will be up to him			0
' but the way i play at full - back , i do a bit of ball handling anyway so it 's not massively different			1
i 'd just get a bit more ball and try and create more than run			0
' i would n't be bothered if i did or did n't , either one or six , if i had an @entity2 shirt on i 'd be happy			2
' @entity4 , who made the switch from full - back to stand - off after being behind @entity61 at @entity62 , was belatedly handed the @entity2 number six jersey for the @entity66 semi-final last november and , according to @entity0 , has impressed in the role during his debut season with @entity69			1
but @entity0 believes that @entity4 will stay at half - back and he will not be switched there ' @entity72 has been brilliant this year , ' @entity0 said			1
' there were a lot of questions being asked because at @entity62 , @entity76 had always been the dominant half leading the team and @entity72 got the ball when @entity76 did n't want it			2
' people wondered whether he 'd be able to do it without those others around him , but he 's been the dominant half			0
his kicking game is pretty immaculate a lot of the time and you 'd think @entity72 would be that first choice at six			0
' @entity4 and @entity0 are among six @entity16 - based players in the national squad , with @entity90 set to join them when he links up with @entity91 ahead of the 2015 season , and the former @entity93 reckons that will help @entity2 's chances of breaking their @entity3 duck			1
' they 'll know a bit more about our players but being in the environment of the @entity16 , with tough games week in , week out , that will prepare people well for the @entity3 , ' @entity0 said			1
' we 've got a good squad together			0
we 're missing a couple of experienced blokes in @entity108 and @entity109 that have been there in previous years but there 's a lot of young lads in this team that have really stepped up in @entity20 and some in the @entity16 this year so i think we 've got a great chance			2
' @entity0 is especially delighted with the appointment of his former @entity15 skipper @entity119 as the successor to @entity108			2
' @entity121 is the ideal choice for captain , ' he said			0
' he 's captained @entity15 for a number of years and has recently been successful at doing that			0
' i could n't think of anyone else better suited to captaining their country			0
' @entity0 runs clear to score his hat - trick try during the @entity3 at @entity131 in 2011			1

@entity0 moved to the @entity16 to play for the @entity134 *warriors*
he expects @entity13 ' @entity12 to *challenge* him for full back jersey
@entity0 is ' happy ' to move to half - back for @entity2 in @entity3
