fashionistas with a conscience can now make an eco-statement with their jewels by buying a precious ring made from @entity6 's densely polluted air			1
scientists will suck dirty air from @entity10 's capital city with a revolutionary machine and compress it for around half a day to make the ' smog stones '			1
jewellers will then set the stone within a band made from a high - quality locally sourced metal to make the smog ring			2
profits will go towards micro-financing the city 's first smog - free parks			0
a prototype of the smog ring shows a clear stone with black dust particles embedded in the centre each ring is made from - and in turn removes from the atmosphere - 1 cubic kilometre of polluted air			1
the rings are the first phase in the @entity33 , the brainchild of artist and innovator @entity35			1
the @entity38 designer , 35 , is currently in @entity6 having talks with the mayor , urban planning and city executives to iron out fine details			1
together with the city 's governing bodies , @entity35 hopes to realise the first of many smog - free parks in @entity6			1
one million rings will go on sale at the end of the year in various outlets worldwide for a cost of around £ 8 - £ 80			0
early prototypes show a clear stone with the black dust particles embedded in the centre , though the ring is still in the design process			0
another prototype shows a chunkier version of the ring and in three different sizes ' i always try to make things which improve life , ' @entity35 tells @entity64			0
' i want to show that people they can be part of the solution			0
' ' the rings may not be the solution but they can bridge the gap between where we are now and where we need to be			0
' @entity35 's background is rooted in creating social designs that explore the relation between people , technology and space			2
right now , he and his team of experts are in the process of developing a safe , energy - friendly installation - the world 's largest - to capture the smog and create clean air			1
it will use patented ion technology and a nano air purifier to create the cleanest , smog - free space in @entity6			1
a four - meter vacuum tower will use ionic filters to charge and remove smog particles , blowing fresh air out continued press interest has inspired large numbers of students , artists , designers and engineers to come forward with ideas on smog reduction			0
@entity35 will collect 100 - 150 of these initiatives for the second phase in the @entity33			1
he will use them to populate an exhibition in @entity6 , showing ' what is possible when we co-create our environment '			0
the show is planned for october 2015			0
the third stage of the project will be the opening of the park in late 2015			2
a 4m vacuum tower will sit in the centre of the park , explains the @entity118			0
ionic filters charge and remove smog particles , blowing fresh air out of the tower ’s side vents			0
this creates a high - pressure zone , which @entity35 ’s main technical partner estimates can create a bubble that consistently has 75 percent less smog than elsewhere			2
the aim is to build a number of smog - free parks in @entity6 that harvest smog particles from the environment			2
the @entity6 government recently launched a £ 133.5m project to have its city smog free before 2017 , and projects like these are leading the way			1
@entity141 to studioroosegaarde.net to keep up to date with the project 's developments			0
the idea is to fund the creation of @entity6 's first 40x40m smog - free park , one of many			1

the @entity33 is brainchild of @entity38 innovator @entity35
hopes to suck smog from air to open @entity6 's first clean air park in 2015
first phase is micro-finance project @entity159 made from dirty air
