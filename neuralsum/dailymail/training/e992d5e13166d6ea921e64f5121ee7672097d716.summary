by @entity0 published : 20:56 est , 29 march 2013 updated : 08:03 est , 30 march 2013 the dazzling moons and @entity2 have long been one of the most mesmerising spectacles in the solar system			1
but now @entity7 scientists believe they may also hold the key to understanding the origins of our universe			1
new research based on data gathered from the @entity15 spacecraft , which is orbiting @entity16 , suggests these bodies date back more than 4 billion years			1
writing in the @entity35 , @entity36 , a @entity15 participating scientist at @entity39 's @entity38 , @entity40 , said : ' studying the @entity16 system helps us understand the chemical and physical evolution of our entire solar system			1
' we know now that understanding this evolution requires not just studying a single moon or ring , but piecing together the relationships intertwining these bodies			2
' data collected from @entity15 's visual and infrared mapping spectrometer ( @entity15 ) have revealed how water ice and also colours -- which are the signs of non-water and organic materials -- are distributed throughout the @entity16 system			2
the spectrometer ’s data in the visible part of the light spectrum show that colouring on the rings and moons generally is only skin - deep			2
using its infrared range , @entity15 also detected abundant water ice – too much to have been deposited by comets or other recent means			0
the authors deduce that the water ices must have formed around the time of the birth of the solar system , because @entity16 orbits the sun beyond the so - called ' snow line			1
' the @entity15 spacecraft observes three of @entity16 's moons set against the darkened night side of the planet out beyond the snow line , in the outer solar system where @entity16 resides , the environment is conducive to preserving water ice , like a deep freezer			1
inside the solar system 's ' snow line , ' the environment is much closer to the sun 's warm glow , and ices and other volatiles dissipate more easily			1
the coloured patina on the ring particles and moons roughly corresponds to their location in the @entity16 system			0
for @entity16 's inner ring particles and moons , water - ice spray from the geyser moon @entity101 has a whitewashing effect			2
farther out , the scientists found that the surfaces of @entity16 's moons generally were redder the farther they orbited from @entity16			0
@entity106 , one of @entity16 's outer moons and an object thought to originate in the far - off @entity110 , seems to be shedding reddish dust that eventually rouges the surface of nearby moons , such as @entity114 and @entity115			0
these two global images of @entity115 show the extreme brightness dichotomy on the surface of this peculiar @entity16 moon a rain of meteoroids from outside the system appears to have turned some parts of the main ring system – notably the part of the main rings known as the b ring -- a subtle reddish hue			0
scientists think the reddish colour could be oxidized iron -- rust -- or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons , which could be progenitors of more complex organic molecules			0
one of the big surprises from this research was the similar reddish colouring of the potato - shaped moon @entity20 and nearby ring particles			0
other moons in the area were more whitish			0
' the similar reddish tint suggests that @entity20 is constructed from material in @entity16 's rings , ' said co-author @entity147 , a @entity15 team member based at @entity7 's @entity148 , @entity149 , @entity151 ' scientists had been wondering whether ring particles could have stuck together to form moons -- since the dominant theory was that the rings basically came from satellites being broken up			1
the colouring gives us some solid proof that it can work the other way around , too			0
' ' observing the rings and moons with @entity15 gives us an amazing bird 's - eye view of the intricate processes at work in the @entity16 system , and perhaps in the evolution of planetary systems as well , ' said @entity169 , @entity15 project scientist , based at @entity148			1
' what an object looks like and how it evolves depends a lot on location , location , location			0

bodies date back to time when our planetary neighbourhood was formed
new research from @entity7 could help *explain* evolution of the solar system
ice deposits found within the rings beyond so - called ' snow line '
