@entity0 gained the upper hand in the @entity3 final but there was still hope for @entity5 at @entity7 's @entity6			1
four - time @entity8 champion @entity0 , who landed his first major title in this tournament 21 years ago when it was played in @entity11 , looked to be racing towards victory when he built a 5 - 1 lead			1
@entity5 by that stage looked to be hopelessly off his game , even writing on @entity16 during the mid-session interval that his performance had been ' absolute poop ' , and adding that he would ' need to play 10x better to have a chance '			0
@entity0 lines up a shot during the final of the @entity3 at the @entity6 in @entity7 @entity0 reacts after @entity5 plays a shot ( left ) while @entity5 looks on disappointed with his performance ( right ) but by sneaking the final two frames of the afternoon to trail @entity0 only 5 - 3 in the best - of - 19 contest , @entity5 would consider himself to have earned a major let - off			1
the pair contested a classic final at last month 's @entity30 event in @entity31 , where @entity0 fired four centuries in a 10 - 7 victory , and this contest had a long way to go to match that standard			2
@entity0 , who suffered a broken ankle on the eve of this tournament , has never lost a @entity8 final , adding titles in 1997 , 2001 and 2007 to his 1993 trophy , which he landed days before his 18th birthday			2
@entity5 plays a shot during the @entity46 final at the @entity6 on sunday afternoon @entity7 was where @entity5 landed his first major success , becoming @entity8 champion three years ago , yet for the opening six frames of this final he was looking likely to suffer a thrashing			1
breaks of 82 , 41 , and 81 allowed @entity0 , himself some way short of prime form , to power four frames clear			0
@entity5 , spending most of the time in his chair , was frequently pawing at his eyes , appearing either tired or unable to understand what was happening			0
he made 46 in pinching the scrappy eighth frame and scrambled over the line in the next , meaning he was back in the match , without playing anything approaching his best snooker , ahead of the 7pm resumption .			0
