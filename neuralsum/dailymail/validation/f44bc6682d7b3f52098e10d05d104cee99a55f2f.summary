a former @entity1 beauty queen who was born following @entity3 treatment has waded into the row against @entity5			1
model @entity6 , 26 , from @entity8 , was crowned with the national title in 2012 but has hit back after the designers labelled babies born as a result of @entity3 as ' synthetic '			1
the row was sparked after comments were made in @entity16 magazine @entity15 about the use of @entity3 treatments			1
angry : former @entity1 , whose parents underwent @entity3 to have her , says fertility treatment should be celebrated and calls for @entity5 and @entity22 to apologise but the @entity24 model has added her voice to stars including @entity27 who have been angered by the comments			1
' according to @entity5 i 'm a synthetic human - ironic for a company who charge Â£ 1,500 for a nylon jacket , ' she said			1
' i hope it was blown out of proportion and they will apologise			2
they were a couple for years ; they would have been depriving themselves of a family			2
' @entity3 treatment allows people who are unable to conceive in the traditional manner the chance of parenthood			1
specialist in ivf technology @entity48 helped @entity51 's parents conceive , and she feels strongly passionate about his work			2
she said : ' i would n't be here if it was n't for professor @entity48			2
@entity27 and @entity56 with their two sons ( left ) and the designers @entity5 ( left ) with @entity5 ' to me and my family @entity3 is of the utmost importance			1
it is wrong for high - profile celebrities to make comments like this when it is crucial for families who ca n't have children			1
' it 's rare to get such negative comments too			1
traditional family is obviously great if it works , but @entity3 is great for families who ca n't conceive ' that 's just the bottom @entity76 treatments are available to us and we should be celebrating it			2
" we should be developing it to make it more successful and available to other people			2
' they were never a company i 've shopped with before , so this is more like a continuous boycott , as i will continue to not shop there			0
' @entity51 won the coveted miss @entity1 crown in 2012 however , @entity16 fashion designers @entity5 have insisted they ' respect all the world ' after their controversial remarks on fertility treatments infuriated sir @entity27			1
the pop star called for a boycott of the famous brand after designer @entity5 criticised in - vitro fertilization ( @entity3 ) , which sparked outrage on social media			0
but @entity5 has now insisted his views were private , personal beliefs that were based on his sense of a traditional @entity104 family			0
in an interview with @entity106 , @entity5 insisted he did not judge people who chose the procedure , and said : ' i believe in the traditional family			0
' it is impossible to change my culture for something different			0
it 's me ... i respect all the world , all the culture			0
' good looks have helped @entity51 make succeed as a model the fashion designer had previously said : ' you are born and you have a father and mother			0
at least it should be like that			0
that 's why i 'm not convinced by what i call chemical children , synthetic babies			1
' that sparked a furious reaction from @entity27 , who has two children with husband @entity56 through @entity3 , who fired back : ' how dare you refer to my beautiful children as " synthetic "			0
' your archaic thinking is out of step with the times , just like your fashions			0
i shall never wear @entity5 ever again			0
' his outburst prompted a mass social media campaign , as 66,000 people joined his call to stop buying clothes from the luxury brand .			0
