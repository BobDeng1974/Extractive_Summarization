there at least 200 billion @entity1 - like planets in our galaxy – and now @entity6 officials claim we could be on the verge of finding life on one of them			1
during a talk in @entity13 today , the space agency announced that humanity is likely to encounter extra-terrestrials within a decade			0
' i believe we are going to have strong indications of life beyond @entity1 in the next decade and definitive evidence in the next 10 to 20 years , ' @entity16 , chief scientist for @entity6 , said			1
' i believe we are going to have strong indications of life beyond @entity1 in the next decade and definitive evidence in the next 10 to 20 years , ' said @entity16 , chief scientist for @entity6 , ( pictured ) at a @entity13 panel discussion ' we know where to look , we know how to look , and in most cases we have the technology			1
' @entity31 , interim director of heliophysics at the agency , added : ' it 's definitely not an if , it 's a when			1
' ' we are not talking about little green men , ' @entity16 said			0
' we are talking about little microbes			0
' the announcement has been prompted by the recent discovery of water by @entity6 in surprising places			2
@entity41 , director of planetary science at @entity6 , noted that a recent study of the @entity45 atmosphere found 50 per cent of the planet 's northern hemisphere once had oceans a mile deep			1
scientists using the @entity50 recently provided powerful evidence that @entity53 's @entity52 ( pictured ) has a saltwater , sub-surface ocean , likely sandwiched between two layers of ice the same study found that water had been present on the red planet for up to 1.2 billion year			1
' we think that long period of time is necessary for life to get more complex , ' @entity16 said			2
@entity6 associate administrator @entity65 said he is excited about seeing what form life beyond @entity1 may take			1
in their hunt for alien life , astronomers have so far focused on looking for @entity1 - like planets around smaller , cooler suns			2
but these exoplanets - despite having a chance of holding water - are believed to be locked in a rotation around their sun which causes only one side of their surface face the star			0
now astronomers claim that such exoplanets actually rotate around their stars , and spin at such a speed that they exhibit a day - night cycle similar to @entity1 – increasing the chance of finding alien life			1
planets with potential oceans could have a climate that is much more similar to @entity1 's than previously expected , ' said @entity91 , a postdoctoral fellow at the @entity92 ( @entity93 ) at the @entity94			1
' if we are correct , there is no permanent , cold night side on exoplanets causing water to remain trapped in a gigantic ice sheet , ' he said			0
' whether this new understanding of exoplanets ' climate increases the ability of these planets to develop life remains an open question			0
' ' once we get beyond @entity45 , which formed from the same stuff as @entity1 , the likelihood that life is similar to what we find on this planet is very low , ' he said			1
' i think we 're one generation away in our solar system , whether it 's on an icy moon or on @entity45 , and one generation [ away ] on a planet around a nearby star			0
scientists using the @entity50 recently provided powerful evidence that @entity53 's moon @entity52 has a saltwater , sub-surface ocean , likely sandwiched between two layers of ice			2
@entity53 's @entity131 and @entity134 's satellite @entity132 are also thought to have an ocean of liquid water beneath their surface in contact with mineral - rich rock			1
this , according to @entity6 , means they may have the three ingredients needed for life as we know it			2
' the science community is making enormous progress , ' said @entity41			0
' and i 've told my team i 'm planning to be the director of planetary science when we discover life in the solar system			0
at the same conference last year , @entity6 administrator @entity151 made a more conservative estimate			2
he claimed that we will find life within the next 20 years - with a high chance it will be outside our solar system			0
@entity6 next @entity45 rover , scheduled to launch in 2020 , will search for signs of past life and bring samples for a possible return to @entity1 for analysis			1
@entity163 took this image of the @entity165 rising above @entity53 's cloud tops			2
the space agency is planning a mission to @entity165 , which may launch as early as 2022 , to find out whether the moon is habitable @entity6 also hopes to land astronauts on @entity45 in the 2030s , which @entity16 says is crucial key to the search for @entity45 life			1
' i 'm a field geologist ; i go out and break open rocks and look for fossils , ' @entity16 said			0
' those are hard to find			0
' so i have a bias that it 's eventually going to take humans on the surface of @entity45 — field geologists , astrobiologists , chemists — actually out there looking for that good evidence of life that we can bring back to @entity1 for all the scientists to argue about			1
' the space agency is also planning a mission to @entity165 , which may launch as early as 2022			0
it hopes to find out whether the icy moon is habitable			0
meanwhile , the agency 's @entity195 ( @entity195 ) , will launch in 2018 to scope out the atmospheres of nearby ' super-earth ' alien planets .			0

the comment was made today by @entity16 , chief @entity6 scientist
' it 's definitely not an if , it 's a when , ' added @entity6 's @entity31
but the likelihood that life is similar to that on @entity1 is low , they said
signs of water have been found on some of @entity53 and @entity134 's moons
