by @entity0 @entity2 justices have deemed a 13 - year - old girl and a 12 - year - old boy both sex offenders and victims for having sex with each other			1
the @entity10 girl and her boyfriend were each found guilty of violating a state law that prohibits sex with someone under age 14 , after the 2003 encounter which resulted in the girl becoming pregnant			1
the unnamed girl , who is now 23 , is asking the high court to overturn the juvenile conviction , claiming the consensual sex should n't qualify as a crime because it does n't for 16 or 17 - year - olds who have sex with someone in their own age group , and she has a right to be treated equally under the law			1
oral arguments on the motion began this week and on tuesday , the justices acknowledged they were struggling with the concept that the girl could be both victim and offender			1
offenders and victims : @entity2 justices have dubbed a 13 - year - old girl and a 12 - year - old boy both sex offenders and victims for having sex with each other ( stock photo ) ' the only thing that comes close to this is dueling , ' said associate chief justice @entity44 , referring to two people who take 20 paces and then shoot each other			1
according to the @entity49 , chief justice @entity48 labelled the predicament a ' peculiar consequence ' and wondered if legislators had intended it			1
state authorities filed delinquency - the term used for juvenile convictions - petitions in july 2004			2
these alleged the boyfriend and girlfriend had each committed sexual abuse of a child , a second - degree felony if committed by an adult			0
the girl appealed the petition , saying that because her boyfriend was the same age as her she should n't be penalized			0
children aged 14 or 15 can be charged with unlawful conduct with a minor if they have sex with a peer , but mitigation renders the offense a misdemeanor			0
appeal : the girl has brought a motion to dismiss the conviction , and justices at @entity2 , pictured , were perplexed by the case on tuesday but for juveniles under 14 , there is no mitigation as the law deems them incapable of consenting to sex			2
a juvenile court judge denied the motion brought by the girl and the @entity91 last december upheld the judge 's refusal to dismiss the allegation , saying the law had to protect minors from each other as well as from older teens and adults			1
the girl then appealed to the @entity101			0
during tuesday 's hearing , assistant @entity91 attorney general @entity102 argued that the law was designed to prevent sex with children who are 13 and younger , even if the other person is in the same age group			2
he said legislators were sending a message with the law that sex with or among children is unacceptable			0
however , @entity112 , the girl 's attorney , claims prosecuting children under a law meant to protect them does n't make sense			0
' a child ( victim ) can not also be a perpetrator in the exact same act , ' @entity117 said , according to the @entity49			0
the @entity2 will issue a ruling at a later date .			0

the two @entity10 , @entity91 minors had consensual sex in 2003 , which resulted in a pregnancy
the girl wants the juvenile conviction overturned , claiming the sex should n't qualify as a crime because it does n't for 16 or 17 - year - olds who have sex with a peer and she should be treated equally
@entity91 justices acknowledged they were struggling with the concept that the girl could be both victim and offender
they *compared* the ' peculiar consequence ' to dueling , when two people shoot each other at the same time
