by @entity0 @entity2 captain @entity1 has thrown his support behind @entity4 amid suggestions of a change of manager at the club and called for his long - time boss to be backed this summer			1
rumours have circulated that the @entity2 are to dispense with @entity4 due to the supporters ' dislike of a his direct style of play			1
but @entity1 , who came to prominence under @entity4 at @entity15 , believes @entity2 are fortunate to have their manager			1
he 's the one ! @entity1 has publically backed @entity4 to remain as manager of @entity2 @entity19 viewing : @entity4 has struggled to win over the @entity2 ' supporters throughout his time at @entity22 ' it 's been one of those seasons but it 's great to know that we 'll be back in the top flight next year , which has been the gaffer 's main priority , ' he told the club 's website			1
' now that we know we are going to be in the @entity32 i 'm convinced that there 's only one way that we 're going to go and that 's to get better and better as the years go on			2
' this year 's been really difficult with injuries , obviously a few suspensions as well along the way , but it 's nice to be able to put this season to bed now and look forward to next season			0
' i really think that given the backing in the post season and then pre-season that we can push on next year and do the business			0
thinking about a change : co-owner @entity47 has been pondering a tinker at the top in recent weeks ' if we did n't have the squad we have , or the lads we 've got here then i do n't think we 'd have survived and i do n't think many other teams would have survived with everything that 's been thrown at us			0
' it 's credit to the gaffer and all the boys for making sure that we are here now and for making sure that we 're going to enjoy another great year in the @entity32 next season			2
' we 're going to be a lot better and i 'm sure that we 'll be in and around that top 10			0
