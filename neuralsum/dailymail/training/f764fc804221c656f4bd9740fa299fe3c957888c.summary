by @entity0 over two million people brave rain and midges to visit the @entity4 each year			1
but one father and son team have got a unique view of the beautiful landscape that tourists ca n't see - by taking photos from space			1
@entity13 , 38 , and his son @entity12 , 12 , designed and built a weather balloon that carried an array of cameras and devices into the space to capture photos showing the curvature of @entity21			1
the equipment was secured to a parachute and floated back , landing in a thick forest west of @entity31 , in the @entity4			1
the excited pair tracked it down and were amazed to see the spectacular footage of @entity35 from the stratosphere - complete with mountains , fields , cities and the coastline			1
the pair managed to record spectacular footage of @entity35 from the stratosphere - complete with mountains , fields , cities and the coastline ( pictured )			2
the sun is pictured at the top of this image @entity13 , 38 , and his son @entity12 , 12 , ( pictured left and right ) designed and built a weather balloon that carried an array of cameras and devices into the space to capture photos showing the curvature of @entity21 plans for a multimillion pound ‘ space port ’ in @entity59 were announced in november last year			1
it could be used to launch space tourists and satellites into orbit within five years			0
possible locations are being considered in the @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity35			2
the portal , which would cost hundreds of millions of pounds , would be entirely privately funded - but the government would be required to change existing regulations because of the dangers of space travel			0
possible locations include a former @entity74 base in @entity75 , @entity35			2
@entity13 , from @entity76 , @entity77 , was delighted with the mission 's success , which was supported by a recruitment agency called @entity81 , based in the city			2
‘ @entity12 and i ca n't thank @entity81 enough for their financial support , as it enabled us to film the curvature of earth from the edge of space , ’ he said			0
‘ all the time spent planning the mission , pouring over different prototypes and researching the construction of the payload and balloon was more than worth it			0
’ @entity97 , chairman of @entity81 , added : ‘ locally , we have @entity99 airbase in @entity75 as a strong contender to become the @entity59 's first space port			0
‘ you never know , in the future we might need to be asked to find engineers working on space travel projects so we thought it would be exciting to get involved			0
‘ i believe we are also the first recruitment agency in the world to launch into the stratosphere - an accolade the team are very proud of			0
’ the helium balloon rose above the @entity21 in just one hour and 48 minutes while taking footage of @entity35 ( a stock image of @entity115 in the @entity4 is pictured ) before the balloon burst , having expanded too much the mission was supported by a local recruitment agency whose branding features on the side of this space shuttle , shown in front of the stunning view of @entity35 the high - tech equipment was secured to a parachute and floated back , landing in a thick forest west of @entity31 , in the @entity4 ( marked ) the mission was supported by a recruitment agency in @entity77			1
it took part in the stunt in the hope that they will one day need to recruit engineers who might work in the @entity59 's first space port			0

a father and son team from @entity77 designed and built the device
the helium balloon rose *19miles* ( 31km ) above @entity35 before it burst
high tech equipment used to video the view parachuted back to @entity21
it was recovered from a thick forest in the west of @entity31 , in the @entity4
shots captured by the balloon *reveal* the curvature of the @entity21
