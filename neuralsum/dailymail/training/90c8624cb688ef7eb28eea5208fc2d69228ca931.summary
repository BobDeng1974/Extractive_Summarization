by @entity0 last updated at 6:14 pm on 27th december 2011 villagers from @entity2 in @entity3 are celebrating after a ban on them producing their own famous cheese was lifted , but bizarrely it must be called something else			1
a ' ridiculous ' legal ruling in 1996 meant the village ’s famous cheese could not be produced in @entity2 as it is not in @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14			1
however , a new decision means the village ’s @entity16 , which first sold the cheese , has been allowed to produce and sell it to locals again - as long as they do n’t call it @entity2			1
cheese production : @entity22 celebrates the ban being lifted with a a special batch of @entity2 cheese , although his will be called @entity26 landlord @entity22 , 60 , said : ' this is something to really celebrate			1
' it was ridiculous that up until now we could n’t make @entity2 in @entity2			1
' people would come in and ask for it and i ’d have to explain we legally could n’t make it			2
' one of the pub ’s owners in the 18th century , @entity36 , became the first @entity39 to market the cheese			2
pride of the village : @entity22 will be making three or four batches a week of the blue cheese local folklore says that he discovered the cheese while visiting a nearby farm in 1730 and made a business arrangement granting the pub the exclusive marketing rights			1
despite being the birthplace of the blue - veined cheese , production moved away from the village in the 18th century			2
production later moved to @entity13 , and in 1996 the @entity56 ( @entity56 ) imposed a @entity57 ( @entity57 ) order meaning that @entity2 cheese could only be produced in @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14			1
however , local historian @entity60 challenged this ruling after finding evidence that the cheese was first created in the village			0
now the @entity65 ( @entity65 ) has allowed the pub to produce the cheese , using the ingredients and techniques required , for local sale			0
' we ’re going to call it @entity26 , ' mr @entity22 added			0
' it will be stilton cheese made identical to the @entity56 ’s recipe , and we ’ll be making three or four batches a week			2
' it takes a day to make the cheese and then it has to mature for three and a half months			0
' we feel it ’s worth the wait			0
' the pub has already produced its first batch , and a special launch date has been pencilled in for march 1 , which is planned to be a day of celebrations			0
historian @entity60 said : ' the village has every right to be proud of its association with the cheese			0
' two years ago we found evidence that the cheese was created here , but production moved to @entity13 in the 18th century			0
' since then we ’ve been applying to get @entity2 in the pdo and finally @entity65 have come to agreement			1
' it ’s a great day for the village and one that ’s been a long time coming			0
