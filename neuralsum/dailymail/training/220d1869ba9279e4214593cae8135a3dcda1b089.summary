by @entity0 humans yawn to cool down their brains as it boosts their mental ability , say scientists			2
how often we yawn is down to the temperature – and @entity8 ( @entity9 ) was the optimum amount of heat to provoke the most yawns			0
a common belief was that yawning helps to increase the oxygen supply but previous research failed to show an association between yawning and blood oxygen levels			0
a common belief was that yawning helps to increase the oxygen supply but previous research failed to show an association between yawning and blood oxygen levels the new study revealed sleep cycles , cortical arousal and stress are all associated with fluctuations in brain temperature and yawning subsequently functions to keep the brain temperature balanced and in optimal homeostasis			2
researchers looked at how often pedestrians yawned in @entity37 in the summer and winter – and compared it to yawners in dryer @entity40			1
they found those in @entity43 yawned more in summer than winter – but the opposite was true in @entity40			0
the researchers said that people tended to yawn more when the temperature hovered around @entity8 because yawning did nothing to cool the brain when temperatures were warmer than that			1
@entity54 president @entity53 yawns - obviously needing to boost his mental ability it 's not just @entity54 politicians who boost their mental ability : @entity60 mayor @entity59 adds to his iq the research published online in @entity63 and @entity64 found yawning had no function when ambient temperatures are as hot as the body – and may not be necessary or may even have harmful consequences when it is freezing outside			1
the study revealed yawning diminished when temperatures were relatively high at around @entity73 ( @entity74 ) in the summer of @entity40 or low and around freezing in the winter of @entity43			2
@entity76 , a phd student at @entity77 , said yawning functions to regulate the brain 's temperature and in turn improves mental efficiency			1
the researchers suggest the spreading of this behaviour via contagious yawning could therefore function to enhance overall group vigilance			0
the young ones : nothing like boosting some mental ability even @entity90 , @entity91 of @entity92 , cabinet minister , biographer , co-founder of the @entity95 needed the occasional mental boost			0

researchers looked at @entity37 yawners and compared yawners in @entity40
yawning did nothing to cool the brain when temperatures warmer than @entity105
yawning regulates brain 's temperature and improves mental efficiency
