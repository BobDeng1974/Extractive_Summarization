by @entity0 a mother who dismissed a cat scratch as nothing to worry about ended up battling a life - threatening blood infection			1
@entity5 , 57 , was forced to stay in hospital for a week hooked up to an iv drip - and almost missed her daughter ’s wedding			1
the incident occurred last month when the @entity12 teacher and sports coach decided to de-flea her daughter ’s cat @entity16 , and put him in the bath to wash away the treatment			1
@entity5 claims she had bathed @entity16 many times before , but this time he had become scared and scratched her elbow , digging his claws into an artery the scratch from ten - month - old @entity27 cat @entity16 caused a blood infection which meant ms @entity5 's arm throbbed and ballooned to twice its normal size ( pictured right ) alarmed , he dug his claws into the crook of her elbow , piercing an artery , and it was 30 seconds before ms @entity5 ’s daughter , @entity37 , could get the claw out			1
‘ it did hurt , ’ said ms @entity5 , ‘ but i carried on and did n't think too much of it			1
' then that night i woke up around 2am with a temperature and my arm throbbing - it was really painful and had ballooned in size			1
‘ i was very worried - i could barely move my arm so took some painkillers			0
’ at 8am , she asked a friend to drive her to the local hospital at @entity49 , where she was told she needed to go to the larger hospital at @entity51			0
it is important to pay attention to scratches , no matter how small , advises dr @entity55 , an immunologist at the @entity56 , @entity57			0
an infected scratch will usually start to look red and infected , and the lymph node will start to swell near the wound after ten days			2
this will be followed by fever , fatigue , headaches and , in some cases , a loss of appetite , enlarged spleen and sore throat			0
worryingly , dr @entity55 adds : ‘ a scratch can look like it ’s healing , but the bacteria could have travelled to another site			0
symptoms can often be seen away from the scratch , because of the incubation period — usually a few days — as the bacteria multiply and divide			2
’ the bacteria can settle on the heart , liver , brain , kidney and lungs , with those with a low immune system — such as the elderly , babies or someone with an existing illness such as cancer or diabetes — being most at risk			0
upon arrival , she was rushed straight through to @entity95 for emergency treatment - and immediately put on to a drip			1
doctors put her on morphine for the pain but she also developed an allergic reaction to the penicillin she was given to fight the infection			1
‘ i came out in a rash and felt lousy			0
it was awful - i 'm an active person - i teach @entity12 and am a gymnastics coach so lying in bed like that was terrible			0
’ to make matters worse , the divorced mother - of - four said had also been preparing for her 28 - year - old daughter @entity111 's wedding			1
‘ the wedding was the start of august and i was very worried i was going to miss it , which would have been dreadful			0
' she was eventually discharged after six days - giving her enough time to recover in time for the big day			2
looking back , she described her relief at deciding to go to hospital rather ignoring her swollen arm			2
‘ the scratch was just one of those freak things			2
' @entity16 had been bathed before , but that time he was just so scared			0
' thank goodness i had the sense to get to the hospital			0
’ alarmed by being bathed , @entity16 dug his claws into the crook of ms @entity5 's elbow , piercing an artery , and it was 30 seconds before her daughter @entity37 ( right ) could get the claw out			1

@entity5 was bathing @entity16 when he sunk his claws into her skin
freak scratch caused his claw to sink into her artery for 30 seconds
*initially* dismissed incident as ' nothing ' and carried on with *housework*
but by 2am her arm had ballooned and she was in *excruciating* pain
went to hospital where she was put on a drip and given morphine for pain
received emergency treatment and stayed in hospital for six days to recover
almost missed her daughter 's wedding *due* to bad reaction to penicillin
