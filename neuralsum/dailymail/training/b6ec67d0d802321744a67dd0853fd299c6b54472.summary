this is the incredible moment brave brain tumour patient @entity2 took his first steps on the road to recovery after his parents ' long battle for pioneering therapy			1
five - year - old @entity2 managed to raise his arm and give a wave as he was helped by his mother @entity11 , 45 , and father @entity12 , 51 , down a hospital corridor in @entity14 , @entity15			1
the youngster , who was at the centre of an international manhunt after his parents took him out of @entity20 because they believed @entity22 treatment would have left him deaf , blind and brain damaged , has just finished his final session of proton therapy treatment			1
the youngster has spent six weeks receiving pioneering proton therapy treatment he has spent the last six weeks at the @entity15 @entity38 where he has received 30 sessions of the pioneering treatment which his parents hope will be life - saving			1
as he took to his feet for the first time since after being struck down with a brain tumour , @entity2 gave a wave to the camera and managed a slight grin			2
his father , who smiled broadly as he lovingly held his son under the arms as he attempted his first tentative steps , said it was great to see his condition improving			0
' it really is amazing how much he has come on , ' he told the @entity53			0
the youngster was later seen waving from his wheelchair as he left the @entity38 following the end of his treatment on friday			0
the @entity58 sparked an international manhunt when they took @entity2 from @entity20 without seeking doctors ' permission in august			1
they were traced to @entity35 where , at the request of the @entity65 authorities , they were put in prison and the five - year - old was held in hospital under armed guard with no family allowed to see him			1
proud : @entity2 's mother @entity11 smiled as her son posed for pictures outside the @entity15 hospital unit on friday care : paramedics lifted the five - year - old into an ambulance ahead of the family 's plan to travel to @entity35 the @entity58 had planned to sell a holiday home in southern @entity35 to fund the pioneering treatment which they desperately wanted their son to have , but which was refused by the @entity22 in @entity84			1
however , after a dramatic u-turn in events , they were eventually released from prison without charge and were able to continue their journey to @entity14 to the @entity38 which agreed to treat @entity2			2
@entity84 later reversed its decision and confirmed it had decided to pay for the treatment abroad afterall			0
despite @entity2 's treatment coming to an end in the @entity15 capital , mr @entity2 said it was unlikely the family would return to @entity65 because they do not feel ' safe ' enough			1
fears : mr @entity2 said they are worried the authorities will take @entity2 from them if they return to the @entity65 instead , they plan to continue @entity2 's treatment in @entity35			1
mr @entity2 said : ' at the moment we do n't feel 100 per cent safe contemplating being in @entity84			2
' there is so much still at stake			0
we would n't want to lose @entity2			2
it would probably never happen but just having that small risk that you do n't have to do anything wrong to have your children taken away and be thrown in prison '			0
he added to @entity115 : ' after some time we decided that perhaps it was best to return to @entity35			2
we have a property there so life can be established quite easily for us			0
' at the moment we do n't feel 100 per cent safe , i suppose you would call it , contemplating being in @entity84 until perhaps they do this investigation into how everything was conducted for us			0
' once that has been established then we can think about going back to @entity84			0
but for the time being we have been in contact with a doctor in @entity35 so we are continuing with ( @entity2 's ) treatment in @entity35 instead of @entity84			1
' earlier this week , @entity133 from the @entity134 told @entity115 : ' we always thought @entity2 would benefit from the specialist treatment here at the @entity38			2
' and whilst he is still not fully recovered , he 's responded very well to the proton beam therapy and there is no reason that he will not continue to get stronger once he leaves here			1
last treatment : @entity12 and @entity140 with @entity2 , prior to his final round of proton beam therapy treatment happy : @entity2 was filmed on an outing to the park in a touching family video posted online by his brother ' i do n't know if you remember the pictures when he was transported here - just lying on his bed in the ambulance			1
' now he can sit on his own , he can play with the toys and his motorics improved dramatically			0
he can also react to his surroundings			0
' the specialist treatment is a more targeted way of destroying cancerous cells than conventional radiation using photon beams , but @entity22 guidance does not recommend it as the best form of treatment			0
during @entity2 's 30 visits to the centre , he had 13 treatments focusing on the brain and spine , to ensure the tumour he had removed has not spread , and the remaining 17 to irradiate where the brain tumour once was			0
he previously had major surgery to remove the brain tumour on july 24 and a further operation on his brain on august 22			0
brotherly love : @entity2 pictured on a family trip to a pizza restaurant with his older brother @entity180 poignant : @entity2 pictured clutching his favourite toy ahead of another round of specialist treatment in @entity14			1

@entity2 took first steps following treatment at specialist *clinic* in @entity14
five - year - old has finished receiving the pioneering proton therapy treatment
he will now return to southern @entity35 instead of @entity65 with the rest of his family
@entity15 doctors say he has benefited from treatment but not ' fully recovered '
parents sparked manhunt after removing @entity2 from @entity20 hospital
