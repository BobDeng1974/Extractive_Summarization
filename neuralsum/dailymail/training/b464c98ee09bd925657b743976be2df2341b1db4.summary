by @entity0 @entity1 has continued to smear former president @entity2 by calling him a ' serial philanderer ' that was a threat to women in the workplace as a result of his extra marital affairs			1
today 's appearance on @entity10 was just the latest interview where he was asked about comments originally made by his wife @entity13 in a @entity15 spread that ran this september			1
' the only reason i 'm bringing it up is because people keep asking me and if you ask me a question then i 'll most likely answer the question , ' he said on @entity10			0
' the @entity55 senator 's thoughts on the former president 's affairs is being given more airtime recently because he is widely considered to be one of the top prospects for his party 's presidential nominee in 2016			1
if that is the case , he will likely be facing secretary of state @entity64 who is in the front - runner position for the @entity30 nomination , meaning that they may be competing for the same job			2
when asked what his accusations of mr @entity2 had to do with mrs @entity64 , he said ' it 's hard to separate them '			1
denial : @entity2 infamously claimed he never had sex with 20 - year - old @entity76 intern @entity75 ' it 's not her fault			2
she 's had to tolerate the same sort of problems from him , i guess , over time			0
' it 's more a question of the entire @entity30 who says there 's a war on women and that somehow the other party 's committing this and yet they support and defend a guy who really in the workplace was doing something inexcusable , should not be tolerated			0
' so really there 's a question of hypocrisy and i think people do n't like hypocrisy			0
' this is not the first time of late that @entity1 has been questioned about the issue , and it seems the subject has come up in every interview he has given in the past week beginning with @entity106 on sunday where he called the former president as displaying ' predatory behavior '			1
still together : senator @entity1 said that while the former president 's philandering ways were not the ' fault ' of @entity64 , he said that it was ' hard to separate ' the husband and wife duo ( seen here on @entity119 ) ' he took advantage of a girl that was 20 years old and an intern in his office			1
there is no excuse for that , ' @entity1 said during the @entity129 show			0
in spite of @entity1 's effort to bring the former president 's philandering ways back to the forefront , it has n't had too much of an effect in his standing in the polls			2
@entity138 averaged out the results from @entity140 , @entity141 , @entity142 and @entity144 polls matching the former secretary of state and the current senator from @entity147 , and mrs @entity64 ended up winning by 10.2 points .			0

@entity1 spoke this *morning* about the @entity150 and was asked again about his thoughts on the affairs of the former president
@entity1 's wife first commented on @entity2 's ' predatory ' behavior in an interview in @entity15 in september
*allegations* are coming up again because @entity1 is a likely @entity55 presidential candidate and could face @entity64 in the 2016 race
