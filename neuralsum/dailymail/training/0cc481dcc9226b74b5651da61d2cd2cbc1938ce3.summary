by @entity0 published : 06:28 est , 24 september 2013 updated : 10:44 est , 24 september 2013 she was a contemporary icon who suffered a very modern death but @entity3 appears every inch the @entity6 lady in a portrait painted by fine art student @entity8 , 21			1
renamed @entity11 of @entity12 , the @entity10 artist has given the singer , who died two years ago , an exquisite golden dress - although her trademark beehive remains in place			1
and @entity8 has n't stopped at @entity3			1
the portrait is part of a series of paintings of deceased celebrities who have been ' tudorised ' by the artist			2
lord and lady : @entity24 ( left ) and @entity3 ( right ) reimagined as @entity6 courtiers by @entity8 the paintings , which also show @entity30 star @entity29 , frontman of glam rock group @entity33 @entity32 and @entity26 singer @entity24 , were commissioned by @entity36 - listed @entity35 bar and restaurant in @entity38			1
' i spent a lot of time at the @entity42 and the fashion museum , looking at patterns and clothing , ' explained @entity8			1
' i did n't want to be accused of copyright [ theft ] so i had to make a lot of it up			0
i did research [ @entity52 's court painter ] @entity53 the @entity55 's paintings , along with @entity56 and @entity57 to get the colours right			2
' i 'd never done anything like this before			0
i usually work from photographs			0
i was quite surprised how they turned out			0
they work really well in the context of the bar			2
i 'm very happy with them			0
' new look : @entity33 singer @entity32 ( left ) and @entity30 star @entity29 ( right ) get a @entity6 make - over it was bar owner @entity71 who came up with the concept of ' @entity74 ' contemporary musicians to adorn the walls of his oak - framed restaurant and pub the building dates back to the early 1400 's and once sheltered the founding king of the @entity6 dynasty , @entity79 , who was en route to the @entity82 where his army dispatched @entity84 and ended the @entity86 line			1
@entity71 's son @entity87 , 20 , a guitarist studying commercial music in his final year at @entity89 , introduced his dad to fellow student @entity8 and the project took flight			1
' he sent me @entity8 's self - portrait and i thought " this is a guy who can really paint " , ' said @entity71			1
@entity8 , who takes a month to complete each painting , is currently working on a portrait of the very much alive dr @entity99 , which will depict the rapper with headphones in the style of @entity105 's @entity104			1
@entity71 said : ' music is an integral part of what we offer here			2
we attract some brilliant touring artists , looking for an intimate venue			0
masterpiece : @entity8 is currently working on a reimagining of @entity105 's famous birth of @entity115 - also for @entity71 real deal : @entity53 's 1537 @entity52 ( left ) and rapper @entity99 ( right ) who will replace @entity115 in @entity8 's new work ' i thought that having pop icons painted to a medieval theme would be in tune with the surroundings			1
' @entity8 is under threat of death not to repeat the work			2
we 've had such a positive reaction that we 're thinking about getting prints done			0
it is @entity32 , of @entity33 who attracts the most attention , perhaps because he 's a bit more niche			2
' we 've had people making pilgrimages here just to see him			0
one lady comes in every two to three weeks and keeps increasing her offer on the @entity29 picture - we 've had offers of five times what it cost to paint but we are not considering selling			0
' he said he thought the paintings might now be worth ' thousands of pounds '			0
the paintings are unprotected , as @entity71 wants them to ' live and breathe with the building ' and @entity3 's has already been splashed with wine			1
' that does n't happen in the @entity150 , ' he added			0
@entity8 says he is still exploring his potential as an artist and is unsure , as yet , where it will take him , but is open to further commissions			1
' i do n't understand my potential in painting yet , ' he said			0
' i would like to think i can do more			0
i would love to be a commissioned artist , earning my living from painting			2
