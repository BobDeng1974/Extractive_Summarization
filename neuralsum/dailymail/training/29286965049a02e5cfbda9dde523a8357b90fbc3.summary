police have interviewed a doctor jailed for 22 years for abusing 18 children with cancer or grave blood disorders and asked him for advice on how to protect children from paedophiles , it was revealed today			1
in december paediatrician @entity9 , 41 , was found guilty of ‘ gross and grotesque ’ abuse of patients and having a cache of 16,000 indecent images of children at home			1
@entity9 exploited his job as a respected child doctor to target boys and would abuse them behind screens , sometimes with their parents in the room			1
jailed : doctor @entity9 ( left , outside court ; and right , in his police mugshot ) , who abused 18 sick boys , was sent to prison for 22 years			1
police have interviewed him to learn about catching paedophiles but he is now advising police on child protection after authorities visited him in prison to learn how to avoid cases like his own , the @entity29 reported			1
@entity35 said the prison visit was ' an attempt to gain further information from @entity9 that might help prevent it in future ' , adding that ' some information was given '			1
the revelation he is assisting police comes amid claims @entity9 has more unidentified victims , and while a @entity47 probe into his crimes at @entity50 's @entity49 is being conducted			1
he was arrested in november 2013 only after the grandmother of a victim complained to the hospital			0
about 800 more families were told their children could have been at risk during the five years he worked for the hospital			2
but the shocking total includes patients he saw at two other hospitals – in @entity61 and @entity62 – where he held outpatient clinics between 2008 and 2013			0
police found more than 16,000 indecent images of children on a disc in @entity9 ’s home			1
in one case he filmed the vile abuse			2
in the wake of his guilty plea , @entity71 ’s launched a helpline and began contacting the families of all patients he was thought to have dealt with			0
gadget : a spy pen used by @entity9 to film some of his victims as he carried out examinations on them about 800 families were told their children could have been at risk during the five years @entity9 spent working at @entity49 ( pictured ) in @entity50 police believe @entity9 targeted the boys – all of whom were ‘ really poorly ’ and vulnerable – in his private consulting room			1
@entity87 was told that many of @entity9 's victims would be isolated from their parents and asked to remove their clothes before the doctor would grope their genitals			1
the depth of the examinations were often increased to meet @entity9 's sexual needs , not any medical requirement , the court heard			1
one said in a statement read to the court : ' i am now anxious to go to the doctor because i do n’t know who i should trust			2
' i have haemophilia and a pain in my side so i know i should go but i feel disgusted and weird			0
i did n’t think it would happen to me and i feel angry every time i think about it but also relieved it was n’t just me but we should n’t have to go through it			0
' another said he had regular nightmares , felt stressed and lacked confidence			0
' i ’d like to see @entity9 and ask him why he did what he did to me , ' he added			1
he would tell their parents they should leave the room in case their children got embarrassed , before sexually touching them for his own gratification and telling them it was a ‘ legitimate examination ’			2
as he left court after being sentenced , @entity9 said : ‘ i ’m so sorry ’ and refused to answer further questions			2
detective superintendent @entity125 said : ‘ this man very cleverly and determinedly created an environment where he not only abused young people , but almost groomed colleagues and parents by being helpful – for example , seeing people outside normal consultancy hours			0
‘ he would see young people who were really poorly in his own consulting room and create opportunities where he was alone with them			0
‘ what makes this case particularly distressing is he was very plausible so he would say to young people that they needed an intimate examination			0
i was n’t a case of “ do n’t tell your parents ”			0
he was putting a veneer of respectability on what he was doing and saying it was a legitimate examination			0
’ mr @entity125 said there could be many other victims – including some who do n’t even realise they were abused			0
sentencing : judge @entity151 ( pictured right in this court sketch ) described @entity9 ( left ) as ' manipulative ' and said his actions had undermined the public 's trust in the ' overstretched health service '			2
