by @entity0 published : 10:01 est , 15 june 2012 updated : 19:08 est , 15 june 2012 a girl of 15 died of tuberculosis after @entity3 told her family to send her to a spiritual healer because she was ‘ lovesick for a boy ’			1
despite crippling illness which left @entity9 painfully thin and unable to walk , doctors repeatedly sent her home , telling her desperate family that her illness was in her mind or at most a stomach bug			1
as a coroner yesterday slammed the doctors for ‘ gross failures ’ which contributed to her death , it emerged @entity9 made nine visits to her gps ’ surgery , three visits to a community health centre , and attended three different hospitals on four occasions in the months before she died			1
neglected : tragic @entity9 died after her gp dr @entity27 failed to diagnose her with tuberculosis each time , doctors failed to test for tuberculosis , even though she had contracted the disease once before			1
this neglect contributed to her death , coroner @entity32 said , and it was ‘ likely ’ she could have been saved if simple tests had been carried out			0
her distraught family , who say their pleas for help were repeatedly ignored by ‘ atrocious ’ doctors , plan to sue the @entity39			2
@entity9 , from @entity40 , @entity41 , was first diagnosed with @entity42 in 2009 after a girl at her school contracted the illness			1
she was prescribed a course of antibiotics and believed it had cleared before being struck down again in july 2010 after returning from a trip to @entity50			0
distraught : the schoolgirl 's parents turned up for the verdict at @entity55 to hear the coroner return a verdict of death by natural causes @entity9 , aged seven ( left ) and 15			1
she was described as normally ' outgoing and bubbly ' until she is believed to have contracted @entity42 @entity60 and @entity61 , the parents of @entity9 , sought help from multiple key healthcare providers across @entity41 and no one was able to diagnose their daughter @entity42 is at its highest level in the @entity68 for more than 30 years , with 9,000 new cases last year alone , up five per cent from 2010			1
most people believe the disease was wiped out by antibiotics in the @entity73 but it never totally went away and cases started increasing from the early @entity75			0
@entity76 , chief executive of the charity @entity77 , said : ' @entity42 is a disease usually associated with certain high - risk groups such as those with @entity81 , those from @entity84 countries and @entity85 , and those living in crowded living conditions			2
but anyone can get it			0
' @entity90 has the highest infection rate in @entity68			0
the disease is often brought into the country by visitors from @entity95 , @entity85 and @entity96 , and it is also common amongst the homeless and drug users			0
last month the @entity100 said foreign travellers entering the @entity68 from countries with high incidence of tuberculosis will have to go through a screening for the disease before being granted a visa			0
the disease is caused by mycobacterium tuberculosis bacteria and differs according to where the infection takes hold			0
most tb affects the lungs but around 40 per cent of cases involve disease elsewhere			0
it is spread when an infected person coughs or sneezes and the bacteria is breathed in by someone close by			0
some people who are infected never develop symptoms - although the bacteria remain in the body , they are not infectious			2
this is known as latent @entity42 and can develop into the active form of the disease years after the original infection , triggered by impaired immunity , being underweight , stress or uncontrolled diabetes			0
over the next four months , @entity9 became increasingly sick			1
her weight plummeted to less than eight stone and she could stomach little more than baby food			0
at one point , @entity9 was referred to a psychiatrist because doctors , who received 46 phone calls from her parents over this time , believed her sickness may have been caused by bulimia			1
her distraught father , @entity139 , claims he was told by one gp , dr @entity141 , that he was ‘ mollycoddling ’ his daughter and that she was just ‘ lovesick ’			1
in december 2010 , a psychiatrist reported back that her illness was physical rather than mental , but her doctors still failed to test for @entity42			1
less than a month later , @entity9 was no longer able to walk			1
on january 6 , 2011 , she was rushed to hospital suffering breathing difficulties and died later that day			1
the pathologist who carried out the post-mortem examination said her lungs were ‘ the worst we have ever seen ’			0
@entity9 ’s family wept yesterday as a verdict of natural causes contributed to by neglect was read out at @entity154			2
mr @entity60 , 43 , said : ‘ i do n’t know how i will ever trust medical professionals again after the heartache they have put me and my family through			0
' @entity9 deserved far better			2
we went back time and again pleading with the doctors to help her but each one of them let her down			2
‘ i miss her so much			0
i still wait for her to come through the door after school			0
’ mr @entity32 cleared @entity165 , a community health facility in the city , and four hospitals of any gross failure in their treatment of @entity9 up to october 2010 because tests at this stage may not have detected the illness			1
@entity9 became unwell after a holiday to @entity50 in the summer of 2010 and was seen by two different gps in the following months he said it was more likely than not , however , that @entity9 would have tested positive for tb by december 8 , 2010 , by which time @entity3 had been told by a psychiatrist that @entity9 ’s illness was not mental			2
mr @entity32 said : ‘ treatment could and should have been started at that time			0
in my judgment it was a gross failure not to refer @entity9 so that tests could be carried out to establish whether she had active tuberculosis			2
’ mr @entity32 said he would write to medical training organisations to voice concern that some of the doctors did not seem to be fully aware that latent @entity42 can be made active by a subsequent and different illness			2
@entity9 ’s family ’s solicitors , @entity193 , yesterday confirmed they had reported dr @entity27 to the @entity195 and will sue the @entity39 for damages			1
dr @entity27 , who treated @entity9 from birth at @entity41 ’s @entity198 , previously told the inquest that @entity9 ’s symptoms did not suggest she had @entity42 in late october 2010 , around 11 weeks before her death			1
he also denied telling her parents she was simply ‘ lovesick ’			0
another gp at the @entity198 surgery , dr @entity205 , told the court he believed @entity9 did not have active tb when he saw her on four dates in september and october 2010			1
the inquest also heard that dr @entity205 eventually referred @entity9 to @entity211 but did not pass on details of her history of latent @entity42 in his referral letter .			1

@entity9 's worried parents called her gp more than 50 times
the 15 - year - old , from @entity41 , also saw doctors at five hospitals
but dr @entity27 failed to diagnose her condition
@entity226 died of the *curable* condition on january 6 last year
