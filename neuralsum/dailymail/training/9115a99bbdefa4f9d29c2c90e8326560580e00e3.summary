there are few things more difficult in this world than a parent having to bury their son or daughter			1
so when @entity11 died of a heroin overdose in 2011 , his parents @entity9 and @entity10 went through months of hell			1
@entity14 was a talented young man who gradually succumbed to a fatal drug addiction , believing that stars like @entity17 and @entity18 were the epitome of glamour and idolising their tearaway lifestyles			1
@entity22 died of a heroin overdose aged 18 towards the end of his life he had started to socialise in these circles			2
in fact , after the 18 - year - old passed away , his parents found a copy of his diary where he had written : ' @entity18 is coming over later and i am going to inject for the first time			1
i hope i do n’t			2
' but in the last three years after his death , @entity11 's family have sought to make something positive out of his tragic tale			1
a tv programme called @entity39 on @entity40 tonight charts the paths of a group of drug or alcohol - addicted classical performers as they attempt to rebuild their careers and lives by performing together as an orchestra			1
in the last two weeks before he passed away , @entity11 mentioned in his diary that @entity18 would be coming to his house and that he would be injecting heroin for the first time the show was the brainchild of @entity11 's father @entity54 , who appeared on this morning earlier today to talk about the reason behind it			1
a recovering alcoholic himself , @entity54 has an affinity with the members of the orchestra because of his own experience with addiction , but it is also poignant because of his son 's troubles in that area			1
he said : ' as addicts we are uncomfortable in our own skins and therefore looking for ways to medicate			1
' my son was a very good musician but also a fabulous writer			1
' he was always very bright and gifted and if he did n’t want to do something he would n't , but if he wanted to do something he went after it like a terrier down a rabbit hole			2
' even in the way he gulped his orange juice as a child , i could see an addiction personality there			2
' i was an alcoholic , so i recognise it myself			2
' it caused a large amount of worry because i definitely recognised the trait in him - we tried to channel it into something positive			0
' unfortunately , at 13 he started trying lots of drugs and became obsessed with a certain pop star ( @entity17 ) and that started a downward journey that lasted for five years			0
' @entity9 has taken part in a new tv programme called @entity39 on @entity40 to try and make a positive out of his son 's death in 2011 @entity54 goes on to explain that despite his own extensive experiences with addiction and his close relationship with his son , he still was n't able to help cure his drug addiction			1
he said : ' we were particularly close towards the end of his life , particularly those last six to eight months			0
' we spent a lot of the time talking in the kitchen because he mostly lived with me during that time			0
' it was n’t a surprise , i knew he was in a downhill spiral			0
' i knew he was using heroin but it was n’t like i sat there watching him smoke it - he went to various rehabs and i was always trying to cajole him to that next level when he admitted total defeat			0
' i actually think he would have got there had he not taken that dodgy dose of heroin			0
' @entity9 ( centre back ) ) pictured with the rest of the @entity130 ' symphony orchestra @entity54 spoke out against addiction extensively after his son 's death , in the hope that it would help other people in the same situation			1
the exposure led to a tv company getting in contact asking if he would like to work alongside them on a drug - related show			0
he said : ' it was a really positive thing to come out of @entity14 's death			2
' i was approached by someone at tv company , asking if i wanted to do something about drugs and teenagers			0
' but i decided to make it about something more than that , something about the road to recovery			0
' orchestral players have huge pressures to go up and perform every night , they take a pill or a drink but then the solution becomes the curse			0
' i think all of the people who took part benefited hugely , but for a few of them it was a life changing thing			0
' i absolutely want to go further with the group			0
