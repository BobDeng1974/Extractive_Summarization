by @entity0 published : 18:32 est , 2 october 2013 updated : 18:38 est , 2 october 2013 quizzed : mr @entity1 debated the burka with a @entity4 mother who called in to the show @entity1 backed a ban on veils in the classroom yesterday after he was confronted by a @entity4 woman who wears the burqa on a radio phone in			1
the @entity13 mayor said schools should have the right to force pupils to show their faces to teachers			1
he told @entity13 radio station @entity19 : ‘ normally i ’m in favour of liberty and people wearing whatever they want			0
where i do draw the line though , i think that the face veil is a very difficult thing to make work in a school			1
‘ i think that you ’ve got to teach in a way that you can see how the kids are responding			0
they ’ve got to be able to participate in the class			0
i think that it ’s only fair that they should be able to react and take part in that way			0
‘ i do n’t think that it can reasonably be called a standard piece of uniform to get little girls to cover their faces			2
’ mr @entity1 was quizzed by a woman identified only as @entity43 from @entity44 in @entity13 , who said that her 15 year old daughter has voluntarily worn a full face veil since she was 12			1
she said : ‘ i myself wear the burqa			0
‘ my daughter is 15			2
from the age of 12 or maybe 13 , she decided for herself , her own free will that she would like to do it			0
' as parents @entity1 , we are expected in society to teach our children to respect one another , to respect schools and so on			1
on the other hand @entity1 , you are asking us to go against school policies or school rules if it involves wearing the face veils			1
’ but mr @entity1 said : ‘ i ’m afraid that is my view i think in places of instruction where you ’re asking kids to participate in a class , to have fun together when the teacher has got to see how the lesson is going down			2
‘ i ’ve been a teacher , very ingloriously in the past			0
it is a terribly difficult job and you ’ve got to know what , how your pupils are responding			2
and i think that is what i would like to see in classes financed by the @entity80 that ’s what i believe in			0
’ mr @entity1 said : ' i think that the face veil is a very difficult thing to make work in a school '			1

@entity1 says teachers must be able to see pupil *'s* faces
he was confronted by a @entity4 mother who says daughter chooses veil
