the evil stepmother make - over on the app gives @entity55 piercing eyes @entity55 ( before , left ) said she could n't see much difference between the two looks ( princess look , right ) the new element to the already hugely successful app comes just ahead of the new @entity8 film 's release this friday			1
@entity63 put the app , which has previously claimed it could turn us into supermodels , to the test to see how @entity68 - like we could look ... whilst we certainly looked more made up than before , did we really look like @entity8 ? @entity69 thought she looked ' terrifying ' as the evil stepmother but liked the blue eyes @entity69 ( before , left ) was n't pleased with the droopy eyebow ( right ) writer @entity73 said : ' while i was pleased that the app seemed to smooth out my imperfections , i would have liked it to add a few more sparkles and perhaps a crown			1

' food writer @entity87 said : ' i was n't that impressed with the app as there did n't seem to be much difference between the step - mother look and the @entity8 transformation			2
the @entity93 app has a new element which means you can make yourself look like @entity8 ' i would have liked to have looked a lot more evil as the step - mother ! i 'd also like to see some - more looks , for example , @entity101			1
' it also gave me a fatter face , which i was n't too pleased with ! ' and writer @entity69 said : ' i think @entity8 got carried away with her new blusher and what is with that droopy brow ? ' as for the evil stepmother , i look nothing short of terrifying			2
i quite like my blue eyes and , of course , @entity111 brows do befit the evil stepmother			0

the @entity93 app now has a @entity8 feature
it can be used to emulate her make up or that of the evil step mother
@entity63 road - tested app which promises to transform you face
however , some of the results were rather *questionable*
