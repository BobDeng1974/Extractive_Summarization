published : 05:46 est , 30 april 2014 updated : 06:49 est , 30 april 2014 clad in black from head to toe and carrying a formidable assortment of gear , @entity0 , a 35 - year - old father of two , is every criminal 's worst nightmare			1
the @entity9 doorman is one of the @entity11 's only ninja warriors and is regularly to be found prowling the streets of his home town , putting himself between the nastier elements of society and everyone else			1
mr @entity0 , a former soldier who goes by the ninja name ' @entity17 ' has been practising martial arts for more than 25 years			1
he says he loves being a ninja so much , he 'll never give it up - regardless of what critics might say			2
crime fighter : @entity0 ( right ) patrols the streets of @entity9 dressed in full ninja gear ' they [ critics ] are entitled to their own perceptions and opinions , ' he told @entity31 in an exclusive interview			1
' this is my destiny and this is who i am			0
if i can give people inspiration and a bit of a message about living your life the way that 's right for you , then i 'm grateful to carry on			1
' at the end of the day , i 'm out there doing something unique and i 'm happy and content			0
' one group who might not be quite so pleased is the @entity9 criminal fraternity who have to keep a weather eye out for mr @entity0 as well as for the police			1
but although he has been known to intervene in fights , mr @entity0 says most of his work involves talking to people in need of a sympathetic ear on the @entity9 clifftops and adds that if a situation appears too dangerous , he calls the police			1
' a lot of time , i come across people who are depressed or lost , ' he explains			2
' back in the day , i used to deal with violence or drug dealing			0
training : mr @entity0 ( centre ) gives tv presenter @entity67 a lesson in the spiritual side of ninja life skills : along with fighting ability , ninjas traditionally had to be physically fit and intelligent ' it 's like second nature to me now			1
i give first aid if it 's needed , call the police if they 're required and if someone is vulnerable , then i will step in and defend them			1
' the last person i met was going to jump off a cliff so i shared some wisdom and knowledge with him and gave him my time			0
' sometimes that 's all they need			2
i try and be loving in that situation and be the best i can be			0
' mr @entity0 's martial arts career began at the age of eight , when a traumatic childhood event inspired him to learn self - defence			1
' i 've been a ninja for more than 24 years now , ' he explains			2
' when i was eight , i witnessed my mum being beaten up one night and i vowed from that moment to become a weapon and never a allow myself or my family to be touched again			0
' later , he joined the army and spent 11 years in the forces , honing his already formidable fighting skills			0
' i learned all about martial arts [ in the army ] , ' he says			0
' i wanted to be so strong and powerful			0
i wanted to be a ninja master and learn how to overcome my physical limitations			2
' now according to mr @entity0 , his ninja skills have become second nature to him whether creeping undetected through the shadows or reading the wind			1
' it 's a consciousness now , ' he adds			2
' when i go out in the shadows , i know how to read the wind , the omens - it is a skill and it 's inspiring			0
it 's like a patrol , a ninja walk			1
i go out to meditate and use my skills			0
' important : mr @entity0 says many of the people who he meets are suicidal and just need a sympathetic shoulder and , says mr @entity0 , his family are happy to get involved too			1
' my family are used to me now , ' he chuckles			0
' my mum even started trying to develop the skills herself , although i think they are quite surprised that i 'm still doing it [ being a ninja ] after all these years			0
' shocked or not , mr @entity0 says they can expect his crime - fighting career to continue			1
' i ca n't stop - it 's the essence of who i am , ' he explains			0
' some people think i might have been a ninja in a past life			2
either way , it 's who i am and i 'll never stop			0
' @entity0 appears on outsiders with @entity67 , friday 10th may at 10pm on @entity141			2

@entity0 , 35 , a doorman from @entity9 , is one of the @entity11 's only ninjas
goes by the ninja name of @entity17 and regularly patrols the streets
calls the police if necessary but has been known to get involved himself
mr @entity0 says many of the people he helps are suicidal and on the clifftops
