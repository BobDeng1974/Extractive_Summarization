a family is in hiding after the wrong magistrate was accused of being responsible for the release on bail of deranged terrorist man @entity4			1
police have been regularly monitoring the family home of @entity7 after he was incorrectly singled out as the presiding court official who released @entity4 , despite the 50 - year - old facing more than 40 offences			1
' they are very overwhelmed by it all , ' a family friend told @entity14			2
a @entity25 magistrate is in hiding after being wrongly accused of granting him bail during a separate court case hostages flee the @entity30 cafe in the early hours of tuesday morning as the @entity25 siege reached a tragic climax a hostage escapes the clutches of crazed terrorist man @entity4 during the @entity25 siege a police raid on the house of @entity37 , the girlfriend of dead @entity25 siege gunman man @entity4 @entity37 , girlfriend of dead @entity25 siege gunman man @entity4 , pictured arriving at police station in @entity25 after the fatal shootout the self - proclaimed sheik , man @entity4 , was on bail facing charges of being an accessory to the murder of his ex-wife , when he stormed the central @entity25 cafe on monday and held 17 people hostage			1
@entity4 and two of his hostages died at the end of the near 17 - hour siege			1
but a mix - up over whether the magistrate 's name was @entity59 or @entity7 has caused heartache for the latter			1
mr @entity7 's family have been the subject of tirades of abuse , and even death threats , after it was claimed , incorrectly , that he had made the bail decision			1
' i guess is a natural reaction by some members of the public who feel obliged to stick their head up and make an issue of it but sometimes they do too much , ' the @entity14 was told			0
the woman would n't elaborate on the level of threats but confirmed there had been serious warnings levelled at the @entity7 family and police were at the premises			1
' they 're worried about the unknown , the fact that it has gone way too far and they were wrongly singled out especially by those who are just ranting about the issue and using the wrong name			2
' they just want to keep their heads down and are very guarded about who they speak to now			0
' the @entity93 refused to confirm that mr @entity7 and his family were under police protection , a spokesman telling @entity14 that they would not be drawn on the matter			1
' we will not be making comment about any apparent threats against the judiciary and can not reveal any security arrangements , ' he said			0
first it was floral tributes now @entity25 has taken to placing chalk messages to the victims of the @entity107 siege ' @entity108 & @entity109 '			0
a message aimed at the two hostages killed by @entity4 in the @entity30 cafe @entity4 , whose real name is recorded as @entity114 , was due to face court on february 27 next year			1
he was placed on a good behaviour bond in 2013 when he wrote a series of offensive letters to families of @entity23 soldiers killed in @entity121			0
but within a year he had been charged with being an accessory to his ex-wife 's murder and more than 40 sex offences against several women			2
ms @entity127 , 30 , was stabbed to death and set alight in april 2013 in a @entity130 unit block in western @entity25			0
@entity4 ' then partner , @entity37 , 34 , has been charged with her murder			1
he had been released on bail in december last year on the accessory charge under the old bail laws			2
it has since been reported that magistrate @entity59 said that the crown , in fact , had a weak case against @entity4 and that the pair did not represent a threat to the public			1
' if there is a threat , it was to this woman who was murdered , ' @entity59 was reporting as saying			0
however , he reappeared in court on may 26 , only days after new bail laws came into effect , and again in october over new sexual assault offences			2
he was deemed then to pose an ' unacceptable risk to interfering with witnesses and endangering the safety of victims and individuals in the community '			0
but the 50 - year - old committed sexual offences against women in the @entity25 suburbs of @entity162 , @entity163 , @entity164 and @entity165 between september 2001 and september 2014			0
the assaults committed in his registered business called @entity169 included sexual intercourse without consent and rubbing of genitalia during sessions in which he apparently acted as a ' spiritual healer '			0

flowers are left as a sign of respect at @entity107 in @entity25			0

according to an interview at @entity194 's @entity193 on july 27 , 2011 , @entity4 threatened ms @entity127 after they had split up and demanded custody of their children , then aged seven and three			1
ms @entity127 , who told police she was afraid of @entity4 , had met him at a local fast food outlet a week earlier to discuss custody			1
police say @entity4 told her ' if i ca n't see the kids more than i am now , you 're going to pay , even i i have to shoot you '			1
court documents from 2011 , when he was charged with stalking and intimidating his ex-wife @entity127 , reveal he had a firearm licence while working as a security officer , but it had expired			0
the file also shows that he allegedly threatened to shoot his former partner if his demands were not met			2
but the 2011 charges against @entity4 of stalking or intimidating his wife were dropped			1
he told police he was just ' a protective father ' and wanted full custody of his sons because he feared they were being maltreated			0
asked about the threat to shoot ms @entity127 he said ' i did n't threaten her '			0
@entity4 told investigating officers that he was a former ' security offficer in @entity23 ' and that he had previously held a forearm licence and gone target shooting			2
members of the @entity229 have flocked to the makeshift shrine in @entity107 to pay their respects faiths of all varieties have been present at the @entity107 shrine in the hours after the deadly shootout there have been tears and tributes as @entity239 struggle to come to grips with the tragedy which took place at the cafe on tuesday morning but ms @entity127 , who became @entity4 ' de-facto wife some nine years before she was murdered , died in a brutal killing on the afternoon of sunday , april 21			2

neighbours in the block reported seeing a woman in a black cape run from the flat			0
it was not until seven months later , in october 2013 , that police arrested and charged @entity4 ' girlfriend , @entity37 with murder and charged him with being an accessory to murder before and after the fact			1
flowers are placed on top of barriers outside the @entity30 cafe where a crazed gunman held 17 people hostage , killing two and wounding several others police opposed bail , and he was put in custody where he complained that he 'd been ' tortued ' and had ' excrement ' thrown on him			1
but last december he was released on bail			0
in april this year , he was charged with sexual assault , and was granted bail			0
however , a further 40 sexual assault charges were laid against @entity4 on october 10 , but he was still allowed to walk free			2
