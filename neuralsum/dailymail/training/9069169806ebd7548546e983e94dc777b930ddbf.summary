by @entity0 a majority of @entity2 do not believe that the @entity3 created the universe 13.8 billion years ago , according to a new study , with @entity2 also expressing a large amount of skepticism in global warming , the age of the @entity10 and evolution			1
rather than quizzing scientific knowledge , the survey asked people to rate their confidence in several statements about science and medicine			1
on some , there 's broad acceptance			2
just 4 percent doubt that smoking causes cancer , 6 percent question whether mental illness is a medical condition that affects the brain and 8 percent are skeptical there 's a genetic code inside our cells			0
more — 15 percent — have doubts about the safety and efficacy of childhood vaccines			0
few @entity2 question that smoking causes cancer			0
but they express bigger doubts as concepts that scientists consider to be truths get further from our own experiences and the present time about 4 in 10 say they are not too confident or outright disbelieve that the earth is warming , mostly a result of man - made heat - trapping gases , that the @entity10 is 4.5 billion years old or that life on @entity10 evolved through a process of natural selection , though most were at least somewhat confident in each of those concepts			1
but a narrow majority — 51 percent — questions the @entity53			0
those results depress and upset some of @entity2 's top scientists , including several @entity57 winners , who vouched for the science in the statements tested , calling them settled scientific facts			1
' science ignorance is pervasive in our society , and these attitudes are reinforced when some of our leaders are openly antagonistic to established facts , ' said 2013 @entity57 in medicine winner @entity68 of the @entity70			1
the poll highlights ' the iron triangle of science , religion and politics , ' said @entity76 , director of the @entity77			2
and scientists know they 've got the shakiest leg in the triangle			0
to the public ' most often values and beliefs trump science ' when they conflict , said @entity86 , chief executive of the world 's largest scientific society , the @entity89			1
political values were closely tied to views on science in the poll , with @entity94 more apt than @entity95 to express confidence in evolution , the @entity3 , the age of the @entity10 and climate change			1
confidence in evolution , the @entity3 , the age of the @entity10 and climate change decline sharply as faith in a supreme being rises , according to the poll			1
likewise , those who regularly attend religious services or are evangelical christians express much greater doubts about scientific concepts they may see as contradictory to their faith			1
' when you are putting up facts against faith , facts ca n't argue against faith , ' said 2012 @entity57 winning biochemistry professor @entity118 of @entity119			2
' it makes sense now that science would have made no headway because faith is untestable			1
' but evolution , the age of the @entity10 and the @entity3 are all compatible with @entity127 , except to @entity129 literalists , said @entity130 , a former priest and professor of biology , philosophy and logic at the @entity135			1
and @entity136 , a biology professor at @entity137 and an evangelical @entity138 , agreed , adding : ' the story of the cosmos and the @entity3 of creation is not inconsistent with the message of @entity143 1 , and there is much profound biblical scholarship to demonstrate this			1
' in addition to disbelief in the @entity3 , a high amount of @entity2 also doubt that earth is over 4.5 billion years old beyond religious belief , views on science may be tied to what we see with our own eyes			1
the closer an issue is to our bodies and the less complicated , the easier it is for people to believe , said @entity160 , a @entity161 priest and historian of technology at the @entity164			0
@entity165 , a 59 - year - old nanny who lives in @entity166 , said she 's certain smoking causes cancer because she saw her mother , aunts and uncles , all smokers , die of cancer			0
but when it comes to the universe beginning with a @entity3 or the @entity10 being about 4.5 billion years old , she has doubts			1
she explained : ' it could be a lack of knowledge			0
it seems so far ' away			0
@entity180 , a 39 - year - old architect from @entity181 , @entity182 , pointed to a warm 2012 without a winter and said , ' i feel the change			2
there must be a reason			0
' but when it came to @entity10 's beginnings 4.5 billion years ago , he has doubts simply because ' i was n't there			2
' experience and faith are n't the only things affecting people 's views on science			2
@entity119 's @entity118 sees ' the force of concerted campaigns to discredit scientific fact ' as a more striking factor , citing significant interest groups — political , business and religious — campaigning against scientific truths on vaccines , climate change and evolution			1
@entity77 's @entity76 agreed but noted sometimes science wins out even against well - financed and loud opposition , as with smoking			2
widespread belief that smoking causes cancer ' has come about because of very public , very focused public health campaigns , ' @entity89 's @entity86 said			0
a former acting director of the @entity216 , @entity86 said he was encouraged by the public 's acceptance that mental illness is a brain disease , something few believed 25 years ago , before just such a campaign			0
that gives @entity224 hope for a greater public acceptance of climate change			1
but he fears it may be too late to do anything about it			0
the @entity0 - @entity231 was conducted march 20 - 24 , 2014 , using @entity232 , @entity231 's probability - based online panel designed to be representative of the @entity2 population			2
it involved online interviews with 1,012 adults and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.4 percentage points for all respondents			0
respondents were first selected randomly using phone or mail survey methods and were later interviewed online			0
people selected for @entity232 who did n't otherwise have access to the @entity248 were provided with the ability to access the internet at no cost to them .			0

confidence in evolution , climate change , the age of the @entity10 , and the @entity3 all decline sharply as faith in a supreme being rises
' most often , values and beliefs trump science ' when they conflict , according to representative of scientific society
