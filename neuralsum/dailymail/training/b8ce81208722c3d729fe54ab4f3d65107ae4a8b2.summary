obesity places as great a burden on the global economy as war and terrorism , costing $ 2 trillion each year			1
a rising tide of obesity is ' a critical global issue ' that requires a ' comprehensive , international intervention strategy ' , researchers have claimed			2
more than 2.1 billion people across the world - around 30 per cent of the global population - are overweight or obese			1
and the epidemic shows no signs of decline			0
experts predict if the current prevalence of obesity continues on its current trajectory , ' almost half the world 's adult population will be overweight or obese by 2030 '			1
obesity places as great a burden on the global economy as war and terrorism , costing $ 2 trillion each year , a new study by experts at the @entity24 has found researchers estimated if current obesity rates continue , almost half the world 's adult population will be overweight or obese by 2030 a report by @entity33 , which studied 44 different ways of combating obesity , found the global impact is the equivalent to smoking or armed violence , war and terrorism			1
in the @entity42 the burden on the economy is £ 47 billion a year - greater than the impact of armed violence , war and terrorism - while in the @entity47 it is £ 663 billion			1
the researchers have called on global governments , healthcare systems , retailers and food and drinks manufacturers to ' coordinate ' their response to tackle the crisis head on			1
they said while the severity of the global obesity crisis is ' beyond doubt ' , there are interventions that are very effective			2
the majority of the weight - loss programmes and policies studied ' are cost - effective at a societal level and could potentially have a high impact '			2
among the interventions researchers studied were subsidised school meals for all , calorie and nutrition labelling , restrictions on advertising high - calorie food and drinks , and public health campaigns			1
the study explored 44 different interventions being implemented across the globe , including : they found no single intervention alone was likely to have a significant overall impact on obesity rates			1
rather , ' a systemic , sustained portfolio of initiatives , delivered at scale , is needed to reverse the health burden '			2
while better education and personal responsibility were identified as ' critical elements ' of a programme to tackle obesity , they were not sufficient on their own			2
researchers said policies and steps that rely less on the conscious choices of individuals , and more on changes to their environment are needed			0
they include reducing default portion sizes , changing marketing practised and restructuring urban and education environments to facilitate more physical activity			0
the report said : ' obesity is a major global economic problem caused by a multitude of factors			0
' today obesity is jostling with armed conflict and smoking in terms of having the greatest human - generated global economic impact			2
' the global economic impact of obesity is increasing			0
the evidence suggests that the economic and societal impact of obesity is deep and lasting			0
' in the @entity42 the burden on the economy is £ 47 billion a year - greater than the impact of armed violence , war and terrorism			1
in the @entity47 the cost to the economy is $ 663 billion a year in the @entity42 , obesity has the second largest impact after smoking , while in the @entity47 obesity came second to armed violence , war and terrorism , researchers found they found obesity has the same impact on the global economy as armed conflict and terrorism , and just ' a shade less than smoking '			1
' in most developed economies , obesity ranks among the top three human - generated economic burdens			0
' in the @entity42 , obesity has the second largest impact after smoking , generating an economic loss of more than £ 44 billion a year in 2012			1
the report found the economic impact from smoking in the @entity42 was £ 57 billion in 2012 , while the country suffered a £ 43 billion annual loss from armed violence , war and terrorism			1
in the @entity47 armed conflict , especially spending on the military , has the highest impact , with obesity second			2
@entity157 cost the @entity47 economy $ 663billion a year in 2012			1
they predict a series of 44 interventions could bring 20 per cent of overweight or obese people in the @entity42 back to normal weight within five to 10 years			1
it would save around £ 16 billion a year in @entity42 , including an annual saving of about £ 766 million in the @entity166 , according to the study			1
more than 2.1 billion people across the world are overweight or obese and that number is growing one in 12 of the global adult population has type 2 diabetes , ' which is at least partly driven by obesity ' the study found the @entity42 @entity176 's efforts to tackle obesity were ' too fragmented to be effective ' , while investment in obesity prevention was ' relatively low given the scale of the problem			1
' the @entity42 spends less than £ 638 million a year on obesity prevention programmes - about 1 per cent of the country 's social cost of obesity , researchers said			1
but the country spends about £ 6 billion a year on the medical costs of conditions related to being overweight or obese and a further £ 10 billion on diabetes			1
meanwhile , the cost of obesity and diabetes to the @entity166 is equivalent to the @entity42 's combined ' protection ' budget for the police and fire services , law courts , and prisons			1
the current rate of obesity and overweight conditions suggest the cost to the @entity166 could increase from between £ 6 billion and £ 8 billion in 2015 to between £ 10 billion and £ 12 billion in 2030 , the study found			1
but the authors acknowledge combating obesity ' will not be easy '			0
for fast action , that is effective , the researchers said more co-operation is needed between public and private sectors			0
they said : ' they ( authorities ) can not focus too heavily on debating which interventions should be prioritised and they should be prepared to engage in trial and error to reach an understanding of which approaches are likely to be most effective			0
' we see the last piece of the jigsaw puzzle being more investment in obesity prevention and in research			0
' overall obesity prevalence appears to be linked to a country 's wealth , the researchers found			2
among the @entity229 nations with per capital gdp exceeding $ 8,000 , only @entity231 and @entity232 have prevalence rates lower than 16 per cent			0
the majority of @entity229 countries have rates of more than 20 per cent ' there is huge scope to rein in the rising trend of obesity acorss the world - and to do so ina cost - effective way			2
' above all , boldness is imperative			0
nothing else with mitigate the huge and rising human , social and economic costs of this crisis			0
' @entity249 director @entity248 said : ' efforts to address obesity have been piecemeal up till now			0
' yet obesity is a systemic issue , born of many interlocking factors , and only a systemic response will do			0
' dr @entity256 , chief nutritionist at @entity257 , said : ' overweight and obesity is a complex problem which requires action across individual and societal levels involving industry , national and local government and the voluntary sector			0
there is no single ' silver bullet ' solution			0
' today 25 per cent of the nation is obese and 37 per cent is overweight			0
if we reduce obesity to 1993 levels , where 15 per cent of the population were obese , we will avoid five million disease cases and save the @entity166 alone an additional £ 1.2 billion by 2034			1
' @entity257 will continue to support local authorities to provide effective weight management services , to influence the regulation of fast food outlets and provide healthier catering in hospitals and schools , which will all help people to lose weight			2
' professor @entity284 , an obesity expert at the @entity286 , said he believes the report ' shockingly ' underestimates the total cost of obesity			0
he said it fails to include the spiralling costs to companies and governments for accommodating overweight and obese people			2
the study examined the effects of 44 different interventions to help reduce obesity levels , including healthier school meals and investing in parental education he said : ' hospital beds and ambulances now need to be strengthened to carry overweight people and even buses , trains , airplanes and entertainment venues need to install bigger and reinforced seating to cope with a society growing in size			1
' governments need to replicate laws imposed on the tobacco industry to label food highlighting the life threatening dangers of consuming products with a high fat , calorie and sugar content ; otherwise the obesity situation will get much worse			2
' the global food supply is not inexhaustible and the current increase in demand is unsustainable			0
people in emerging markets , particularly @entity326 , are now consuming larger more calorific helpings of food and demand may soon exceed supply			0
' obese people are also likely to have obese pets due to over feeding and lack of exercise			0

more than 2.1 billion people across the world are overweight or obese
that equates to around 30 *%* of the world 's population
by 2030 experts predict half of all adults will be overweight or obese
obesity costs the global economy $ 2 trillion each year
in the @entity42 the burden is £ 47 billion a year , while in the @entity47 it is £ 663 billion
experts studied 44 different interventions to help tackle obesity
they looked at healthier school meals , calorie labelling , restrictions on advertising high - calorie food and drink , and public health campaigns
found no single intervention will work but combined strategy would
called on global governments , healthcare systems , retailers and food and drink manufacturers to work together to tackle obesity head on
