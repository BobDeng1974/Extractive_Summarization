by @entity0 published : 16:49 est , 24 october 2012 updated : 16:55 est , 24 october 2012 a wild monkey that gained notoriety for wandering around @entity3 , @entity4 for two years - before attacking a 60 - year - old woman earlier this month - has finally been captured			1
wildlife officials caught the rhesus macaque on wednesday on a low tree branch following a five - hour stakeout in south @entity10			1
' we concealed ourselves in the area , ' @entity11 , spokesperson for the @entity12 , told @entity15			2
' and we waited for the monkey to approach			2
' caught ! the mystery monkey of @entity3 has been captured after more than two years on the run plan : wildlife officials staged a five - hour stake out before they caught the monkey in a tree branch the monkey was shot with a tranquilizer dart and officials waited for its effects to set in - but the monkey ran off , leading to a chase for 50 to 100 yards			1
after the dash through a wooded area , wildlife trapper @entity32 grabbed it with his hand and a pole , and @entity11 said he then ' settled down quite a bit '			0
he was then taken to a veterinarian 's office to be evaluated			0
staff will check him for contagious diseases and microchips , which would lead them to a previous owner			1
officials will hold him for 30 days to ensure no one claims him before trying to find him a new home			1
attempted escape : a chase ensued after the monkey was hit with a tranquilizer dart but ran off checks : he will now be tested for diseases and authorities will try to find him a new home if he is not claimed the capture was much simpler than initial plans to lure the monkey with companionship and food , first by using a female monkey and then @entity62 , a one - year - old male sitting inside a trap with fruit			1
another plan that authorities had tried was enticing him with bananas - but he always nabbed the fruit and ran off before he could be caught			0
that effort came two weeks ago after a woman was attacked by the animal as she sat on her porch			1
the animal jumped on the woman and began scratching and biting her , proving theories put forward by experts that its interaction with humans would eventually lead to dangerous behaviour			0
hearing her mother 's screams from inside , the woman 's daughter rushed outside to her aide , grabbing the monkey by its legs and flinging it across the garden before it scampered away			1
fears : the capture comes two weeks after the monkey jumped on a local woman and attacked her neighbour : the rhesus macaque has lived in the @entity10 , @entity4 area since 2010 and though wildlife officials have warned that it would become a hazard if fed ' she could hear the clicking of teeth , ' her daughter told the @entity100			1
' it 's been very traumatizing for her			0
' the woman was treated for puncture wounds and both she and her daughter are said to be fine after having been given shots to prevent them from contracting infections			0
the incident has ignited fear among members of the south @entity10 community who are well acquainted with the animal and have come to refer to it as the @entity112			2
it is thought to have been separated from a colony in @entity115 and has been living alone in gardens belonging to @entity118 residents since 2010			0
the daughter of the 60 - year - old woman who was bitten said that it had visited their garden nearly every morning for the past year and a half			2
very serious : @entity125 shot a segement on the @entity127 about the monkey in 2010 and made fun of the way it had managed to elude authorities with its resistance to tranquilisers long way from home : the rhesus macaque is thought to have been separated from a colony in @entity115 before it ended up in @entity118 and more specifically @entity10 she said in a statement : ' the monkey is not afraid of people			1
so do n't got outside very often			0
i do n't trust the monkey			0
' so famous was the 40lb macaque , that it has its own @entity148 page and comedian @entity125 even filmed a segment about it in 2010			2
chuckling overt the monkey 's ability to escape capture by wildlife experts , mr @entity125 showed a clip from an interview in which animal rescue professional , @entity32 told reporters : ' i 've personally shot drugs into this animal a dozen times and for whatever reason it does n't seem to affect him			0
' in august , a sincere mr @entity32 even appeared in a @entity166 special speculating on whether the monkey may show his face at the @entity169 in @entity170 and explaining that , thanks to his agility and speed , he could be anywhere at any time and hard to catch .			0
