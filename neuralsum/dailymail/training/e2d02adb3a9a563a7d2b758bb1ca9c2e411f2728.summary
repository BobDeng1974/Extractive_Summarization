by @entity0 @entity1 knows a good fight when she sees one			2
the @entity4 presenter and wife of @entity6 - one half of last week 's epic @entity9 brawl with billionaire @entity10 - has taken to @entity11 to cheekily point out the similarities between her husband 's dust up and the one captured on @entity16 between @entity17 and brother - in - law @entity18 and it seems @entity1 wishes her other half had the fashion sense of the @entity23 recording elite			1
two paparazzi captured @entity6 and @entity10 , clad in clothes more befitting of bums than billionaires , punching and rumbling down sir @entity38 last sunday after the @entity4 boss confronted his friend of 35 years outside the @entity10 mansion			1
on monday morning ( @entity23 time ) @entity43 posted a sensational video captured on security cameras inside an elevator of @entity49 's @entity48 last week			2

the combined wealth of @entity18 and his superstar wife is reportedly approaching $ 1 billion ( @entity77 )			0
@entity17 is also not short of cash and was probably as close to @entity18 as @entity6 is to @entity10 , who 's relationship may well have frosted over slightly after last week 's events			1

@entity17 ( middle right ) is pictured after the fallout between sister @entity17 and her husband @entity18 last week between the two opponents @entity1 's light - hearted stab at her husband and his once best man was well received by her @entity11 followers and has so far been retweeted more than 80 times			1
today producer @entity93 joked on @entity11 : ' clearly you 're @entity33 right ? ! '			0
@entity1 , who retweeted the post , obviously agreed with the sentiment			0
there are even more overlaps in the ' kinship ' @entity1 feels with the musical royalty aside from the fact that both sides boast brawling ultra-rich people			0

unlike the two men - who both bunkered down in the days following their jaw - dropping altercation - @entity18 and @entity17 have been spotted out and about in recent days			1
neither seemed fazed by the elevator rumble , with @entity18 sporting a wide grin at the basketball with wife @entity33 on monday night and @entity17 tweeting that same day : ' this might have been top 10 days ever in life			1
