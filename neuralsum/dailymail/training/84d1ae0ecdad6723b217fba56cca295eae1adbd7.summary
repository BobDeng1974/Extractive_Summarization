by @entity0 published : 08:06 est , 29 october 2013 updated : 12:55 est , 29 october 2013 councillors in an impoverished @entity3 village have been criticised for splashing out on a @entity5 - style building which has been used only to store crops local councillors in @entity10 , in @entity8 province , were given a grant intended to transform the under - developed area into an ecological park			1
but it appears all the money has been spent on a small but lavishly - designed waterside building that replicates the iconic @entity5			2
rip - off ? @entity3 officials in the poor county of @entity20 deny they have wasted grant money on a waterside building that looks like @entity5 greenhouse : the money was intended to transform @entity20 into an ecological centre , but instead they got a lavish building officials however strongly deny the copycat claims and say the building was built as a greenhouse			1
the empty structure , that looks out of place among the rundown houses in the neighbourhood , has been unused and empty for four years			0
so local farmers decided it was the perfect place to keep crops dry over winter , which has become the building 's default purpose			2
managers of the newly - created ecological park claim that the building was not an attempt to create a copy based on the @entity5			2
the resemblance with the ' ecological ' building in @entity49 to the @entity5 , pictured , has been noticed by many , who have criticised councillors for wasting money they said it was to be a giant greenhouse to be used as a nursery for planting exotic crops for the local fields			1
most critics have dismissed this however , pointing to the restricted light and limited floor space inside the building			0
with just 120 square metres , they point out that it would n't be very practical , since hardly any young plants could be raised there			0
the money was supposed to benefit local people in the under - developed area			0
it was used to build the striking building , which has laid empty for four years but park spokesman @entity72 was adamant that they had not been wasting money by creating buildings that were copies of something more famous elsewhere : ' we built it to look like a booming flower , and not as a copycat as the @entity5 opera house			1
' i know it has been unused for some time but we will put it into use soon , and not leave it unused any longer			0
