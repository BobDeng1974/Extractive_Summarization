the first fraud victims who had their credit cards details stolen and used by hackers who infiltrated @entity5 's computer systems today emerged to condemn the store			1
the store has admitted that data from about 40 million credit and debit cards might have been stolen from shoppers at its stores during the first three weeks of the holiday season , in the second - largest card breach at a @entity14 retailer			1
the data theft , unprecedented in its scale , took place over a 19 - day period that began the day before @entity19			1
@entity5 said that it identified and resolved the issue on december 15			1
it is thought hackers obtained the data by remotely installing software on 40,000 credit card machines in nearly all of @entity5 's 1,797 stores nationwide			1
the software could have spread through the @entity5 network after being installed on a company machine , possibly by fooling an employee into clicking on a fake link in a ' phishing ' scam			1
@entity33 , 23 of @entity34 , @entity35 , said was the victim of credit card fraud earlier this week and he believes it was tied to a purchase he made at @entity5 with his @entity41 card on @entity42			1
however , he called @entity43 and the card issuer could n't confirm			0
he says he has n't been able to get through @entity5 's call center			1
the software installed on 40,000 machines across @entity5 's 1,797 stores read the information on a card 's magnetic strip - including account number , sort code and @entity70 code - when it was swiped through the machine			1
all the card details were then sent back to the hackers through the internet , before the theft was discovered after nearly three weeks			1
on monday , @entity33 received a call from his bank 's anti-fraud unit saying that there were two attempts to use his credit card in @entity81 - one at a casino in @entity83 , @entity81 for $ 8,000 and the other at a casino in @entity86 , for $ 3,000			1
both occurred on sunday and both were denied			0
he canceled his credit card and plans to use cash			1
although @entity33 has no proof , he says he believes the fraud was tied to his @entity42 purchase at @entity5			1
" i wo n't shop at @entity5 again until the people behind this theft are caught or the reasons for the breach are identified and fixed , " said @entity33			1
though smaller than the breach disclosed in march 2007 by @entity100 , parent of apparel chains @entity103 and @entity104 , the data theft took place over a much shorter period and hit shoppers at the beginning of the @entity14 holiday season			1
@entity5 said the breach might have compromised accounts between november 27 and december 15 , a period of nearly three weeks			2
the data theft revealed by @entity100 took place over 18 months , affecting 45.7 million payment cards , according to the company			2
banks later said in court documents that the hackers could have obtained more than 94 million account numbers in the @entity100 case			0
on thursday , @entity5 told customers in an alert on its website that the criminals had stolen customer names , payment card numbers , expiration dates and their @entity130 security codes			1
the company 's shares fell in today as the @entity133 launched an investigation and the first victims of the theft began to emerge			2
this data would allow them to produce counterfeit credit cards , and if they were also able to intercept @entity140 numbers they would be able to create debit cards to withdraw money from @entity143			2
" on december 15 , we were able to identify an unauthorized access and we were able at that time to resolve the issue , " @entity5 spokeswoman @entity144 said by telephone			2
almost all stores : nearly all of @entity5 's 1,797 stores were targeted as hackers infiltrated 40,000 credit card machines @entity154 , a closely watched security industry blog that broke the news on wednesday , said the breach involved nearly all of @entity5 's 1,797 stores in the @entity14 and investigators believed the data was obtained via software installed on point - of - sales terminals used to swipe magnetic strips on payment cards			1
it is not yet clear how the attackers were able to compromise point - of - sales terminals at so many @entity5 stores			1
" it is very clear it is a sophisticated crime , " @entity144 said			0
if you think yours was one of the 40 million credit or debit cards involved in a data breach at @entity5 , security experts recommend a policy of watching and waiting : watch the account you used at the retailer on a daily basis , and wait , because there 's no telling when it will be tapped by thieves			1
with the information that was obtained in the data breach between nov. 27 and dec. 15 - cardholder names , card numbers and the three - digit security codes - crooks can use them for online transactions or manufacture duplicate cards			2
" this could be something that hits your card months from now , so you need to continue to be vigilant , " says @entity191 , chief executive officer of @entity192 , a company that offers a free service monitoring credit and debit cards for unusual activity			1
do n't look for crazy , big - ticket charges , @entity191 says			0
sophisticated hackers are more likely to make small purchases , sometimes aimed at checking the viability of an account			0
" these folks are not going to put a $ 10,000 charge on one card , " @entity191 says			0
" they 're going to put a $ 1 charge on 10,000 cards			0
" small charges are less likely to be noticed and disputed , he says , and a single charge - even if it 's for just 99 cents - enables the crooks to resell the stolen information at a premium , according to @entity191			0
a validated stolen card number is worth more than an untested one , he says			0
if you used a credit card at @entity5 , you have more protection than if you used a debit card			1
that 's because consumers are protected from the fraudulent use of a credit card			1
you still have to report the fraud to your card issuer			0
a fraudulent charge is typically credited back to the consumer 's account after a fraud report is made			0
the card issuer then investigates the complaint and , unless the charge is found to be valid , the credit will be made permanent			2
with a debit card transaction , money immediately comes from the consumer 's bank account			2
after filing a fraud report with the bank , it is then in the bank 's hands when - or if - to return that money			0
either way , if a fraudulent charge is spotted , consumers should get a new card			0
but experts say it 's better to err on the side of caution , and - at least for debit card holders - get a new card now			2
" i do see this as a very severe breach			0
take it very seriously , " says @entity258 , senior information security adviser for @entity259 , @entity261 - based @entity260 , a company that does data breach prevention and post-breach analysis			0
@entity258 says he used his debit card at a @entity5 store during the period the numbers were stolen			1
he requested a new debit card and pin number			0
" that 's how seriously i 'm taking the matter , " he says			0
at a minimum , change your pin number , experts advise			0
if the thieves have captured your pin , you can prevent them from getting a cash - back during a transaction or using your card at an atm machine , @entity258 says			2
@entity144 , a spokeswoman for @entity5 , says there is no indication at this point that @entity286 were collected by the thieves			1
by @entity288 the @entity133 is working on the investigation , according to an agency spokeswoman			0
a @entity292 spokeswoman declined to comment			0
" while this search for the truth is happening , the issue damages the trust @entity5 have gained in mobile and calls into question how sales ( will ) trend in january , " said @entity293 , chief executive officer of @entity294			2
@entity5 spokeswoman said the stolen information was limited to data stored on the magnetic strip and she tried on friday to downplay the situation @entity309 and @entity41 officials had declined to comment late on wednesday , after news of the breach surfaced			1
an @entity313 spokeswoman said the company was aware of the incident and was putting fraud controls in place			0
the theft is particularly troublesome for @entity5 because it has has used its red branded credit and debit cards as a marketing tool to lure shoppers with a 5 percent discount			1
as many as 25 per cent of @entity5 shoppers use the store branded cards			2
this holiday season , @entity5 added other incentives to use its cards			2
two days before @entity19 , @entity329 ran a special review sale with 25 exclusive offers , from electronics to housewares for those who used the branded card			0
households who activate a @entity5 - branded card have increased their spending at the store by about 50 percent on average , the store says			1
' this is how @entity5 is getting more customers in the stores , " said @entity293 , ceo and @entity344			1
" it 's telling people to use the card			2
it 's been a big win			0
if they lose that trust , that person goes to @entity354			0
' @entity5 said it had alerted authorities and financial institutions immediately after it was made aware of the unauthorized access and that it was " putting all appropriate resources behind these efforts			2
" the company said it hired a forensics firm to investigate the incident			0
@entity5 's shares were down 1.7 percent an hour before the market was due to open			1
the shares , which have risen 7.4 percent this year , closed at $ 63.55 on the @entity366 on wednesday			0
the stock has largely underperformed the broader @entity368 , which has risen 27 percent this year			0
hackers usually sell account information on the black market to those who want to produce fake cards			0
crime rings use the cards to buy gift certificates from large stores that they later turn into cash , according to investigators			0
@entity5 advised customers to check their statements carefully			0
those who see suspicious charges on the cards should report it to their credit card companies and call @entity5 at 866 - 852 - 8680 .			1
