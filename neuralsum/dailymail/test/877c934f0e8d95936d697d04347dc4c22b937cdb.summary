doctors have called for under - fours to be given free vitamins after a rise in the number of cases of rickets due to a lack of exposure to sunlight			1
the country 's chief medical officer @entity9 is said to be concerned at the number of children suffering from the condition , which is caused by a deficiency in vitamin @entity15 the disease , a scourge of @entity18 , was virtually eradicated after the @entity19 but is returning as more and more youngsters are used to staying indoors playing video games than going outside			1
the move is being supported by one of @entity41 's leading experts on vitamin d deficiency at @entity43 , who has spoken about an ' epidemic ' of cases due to a lack of sun exposure and overuse of sunscreen			1
he told the @entity51 : ' nothing is free but the cost of the ill - effects of deficiency , such as rickets and anaemia from families not providing children with these supplements is greater for the @entity61			1
' sunblock is so powerful it does work but you end up with no exposure to the sun. ' the outcome is that you are blocking out sunshine and you have a secondary effect of reduced exposure to sunshine which the human race needs			0
' @entity74 is caused by a deficiency in vitamin d and causes bone deformities such as bowed legs , pictured , and a curvature of the spine @entity74 , which is also known as soft bones , can cause deformities such as bowed legs and a curvature of the spine			1
during the war children were given food supplements such as cod liver oil , but this practice stopped in the 1950s			2
an estimated 40 per cent of children are estimated to have vitamin d levels below the recommended amount			0
figures from the @entity61 show there were 833 hospital admissions for children suffering from the condition in the financial year 2012 - 13			0
professor @entity30 has previously spoken out about the advantages of giving free vitamins to young children			1
a scheme has already been set up in deprived areas of @entity103 handing out supplements , which has halved the number of cases of rickets and other deficiency problems			1
she said : ' we are offering these vitamins to vulnerable children and the take - up is low , but many children not in these communities need them too			2
' the @entity61 already recommends all youngsters aged six months to five years take the vitamins , but parents must pay for them unless they are part of the @entity61 ’s means - tested @entity119 scheme			0
professor @entity30 said the @entity41 ’s record on children ’s health used to be ‘ one of the best but we are now the worst ’			1
possible causes include lifestyle behaviours in pregnancy such as smoking , and poor care in infancy			0
rickets , or soft and deformed bones , was first noted by physicians in ancient @entity133 but was not linked with lack of vitamin d until the start of the 20th century			0
it was common in @entity139 times because of lack of access to sunlight – which the body needs to make vitamin d – and poor diets			0
it mostly disappeared in the @entity147 during the 1940s thanks to the fortification of foods such as margarine , and children were also routinely given cod liver oil			0
@entity74 is still a major problem in third - world countries			2
however , @entity41 cases have been rising in the past 15 years , from 183 in 1996 to 762 in 2011			2
experts believe this is partly because children are eating less fish and eggs than in the past			0
they also blame extensive use of sunscreen , and children spending more time indoors .			2

dame @entity9 has ordered review into cost of giving out free vitamins
comes after a rise in the number of cases of rickets in children in the @entity41
*increase* is being put down to fact children spend less time outside playing
@entity74 can cause bone deformities such as bowed legs and a curved spine
