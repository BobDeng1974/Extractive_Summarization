the two @entity5 doctors battling the ebola virus are entering a ‘ critical ’ phase of their treatment , the head of the charity which sent them to @entity3 has revealed			2
@entity9 , president of @entity10 , told @entity11 that within the next few days we will know if @entity13 and @entity14 are likely to survive			1
he said that @entity15 could turn for the worse within hours and that both the patients may soon begin to show signs of internal bleeding which could be fatal			1
last week dr @entity13 , 33 , from @entity35 , @entity36 , was identified as the first @entity5 to be diagnosed with @entity15 , which kills up to 90 per cent of those it infects			1
mrs @entity14 , 60 , an educator turned missionary from @entity41 , @entity42 , was the second			1
the condition update will be agonising for both their families - not least dr @entity13 ’s wife @entity47 who is in the @entity48 with their two young children			1
dr @entity13 and mrs @entity14 were in @entity3 with @entity10 and @entity50 , a @entity51 aid charity			1
dr @entity13 was treating the sick whilst mrs @entity14 was disinfecting medics as they left isolation wards			1
hoping to survive : dr. @entity13 is fighting @entity15 to the best of his ability and will know whether or not he 'll live sometime in the next few days mr @entity9 told @entity11 that both were being treated in isolation private houses at the sim compound near the @entity3 capital @entity62			1
mrs @entity14 was still in her home and her husband @entity21 has had to move out			2
mr @entity9 said he spoke to dr @entity13 on monday and that he ‘ was n’t as good as he had been ’			2
he said : ‘ the situation is so fluid			0
one day it ’s up , one day it ’s down			0
he was up working on his computer , talking with people this is not a bed ridden situation			0
‘ he is moving , he is active			0
he is interactive and we are pleased with that ’			0
mrs @entity14 is suffering from diarrhea but is talking and in touch with family via her computer on @entity78 and via email			2
mr @entity9 said : ‘ her husband @entity21 seems strong			0
he is handling this with faith but he is also realistic with @entity14 and @entity82			2
‘ this is not a light situation			0
this is a very serious situation but we are encouraged by how they are doing so far			0
‘ the next few days are critical in assessing the recovery of both of them ’			2
days may be numbered : if the doctors reach stage two of the disease blood pours out of their ears and nose and turns their eyes from white to red @entity100 spokesman @entity99 said that the coming days are so important because symptoms would start to show that would indicate that the disease had entered its second , more serious phase			1
the first stage is characterised by fever , headaches , nausea , vomiting , a rash and diarrhea			2
the second however is haemorrhagic fever in which patients endure difficulty breathing and swallowing and agonising bleeding inside their body			2
blood pours out of their ears and nose and turns their eyes from white to red			1
they die an agonising death			0
generally patients who enter the second stage do not survive			1
mr @entity9 said that @entity10 had not yet identified how dr @entity13 and mrs @entity14 had become infected but said that they take ‘ extreme safety measures ’ and follow guidelines from the @entity127			1
he said : ‘ our hearts just break for them ’			0
so far more than 600 people have been killed in the outbreak across @entity32 that has infected more than 1,200			0
@entity3 has closed its borders to help stop the disease amid fears that it could spread after a patient suffering from @entity15 took a flight to @entity140 in @entity141			1
mr @entity9 said : ‘ what we have here really is the potential for this to become a tsunami of destruction for the country of @entity3 and that why we are calling on the international community to now respond			0
‘ it ’s grown to such proportions that it ’s overwhelming @entity50 and sim and it needs others like the @entity48 to help			0
‘ it ’s like a wildfire in the @entity48			0
it ’s like what happens to a small fire that continues to grow and no - one is trying to put it out			0
‘ this is preventable but right now @entity100 is the only care center for @entity15 patients in @entity3 and that has to change ’ .			1

within the next few days we will know if @entity13 and @entity14 are likely to survive
@entity15 could turn for the worse within hours and that both the patients may soon begin to show signs of internal bleeding which could be fatal
if the doctors reach stage two of the disease blood pours out of their ears and nose and turns their eyes from white to red
