every bride wants to look perfect on their wedding day and it seems @entity4 is no exception			1
but will she really go as far as to have surgery to remove bulging veins in her arms ? that 's the claim made by @entity12 magazine @entity11 who report that the actress ' wants to look as beautiful as possible when she walks down the aisle this summer ' to tie the knot with long - term partner @entity17			1
@entity4 is regularly voted one of the most beautiful women in the world but an ' insider ' told the magazine the oscar - winner ' has always had a complex about how her veins jut out '			1
bridal perfection : a @entity12 tabloid states @entity4 wants to be rid of the jutting veins in her arms ahead of her wedding to @entity17 they said : ' she never had an incentive to do anything about it until now			1
she 's chosen a sleeveless gown for her wedding day , and the last thing she wants is to be looking like a freak in the photographs			0
' it 's is unlikely there will be much chance of that when the 38 year old marries @entity17 , 50 , with whom she has six children			0
but the magazine claim she 's so keen to ' tidy up ' her appearance for the big day she will consider surgery			0
the other option would be for the slim star to gain weight so the protruding veins were less obvious but the source said ' that ’s not an option to her			1
' according to an ' insider ' the actress , pictured here with @entity17 and their son @entity58 , has always had a ' complex ' about her veiny arms and the wedding has finally given her an incentive to do something about it ' if she took the time to bulk up , everything in her life – including the toll all the weight loss has taken on her body – would fall into place			1
but @entity73 's just too busy to eat			0
she ’s also convinced that she needs to stay super-skinny to maintain her sex appeal			0
that leaves her no option but surgery to tidy up those veins , ' they said			2
endovenous laser treatment is frequently used to reduce the appearance of unsightly varicose veins			2
a catheter is inserted into the troublesome vein and a laser is passed through that which then delivers short bursts of energy that heat up the vein and seal it closed			2
blood no longer pumps through it and so it disappears			0
what complex ? sceptics point out that if @entity4 is so paranoid about her arms , why does she often wear sleeveless gowns on the red carpet ? @entity99 offer the treatment in the @entity101 on varicose veins in the leg for a ' guide price ' of £ 1,765			1
they state the loss of the treated vein is not damaging because ' after treatment the blood in the faulty veins will be diverted to other normal veins in order to make its way back to the heart			1
' @entity115 a venous specialist at cosmetics surgery provider @entity117 and @entity119 told @entity120 : ' @entity121 is an established minimally invasive technique for the treatment of varicose veins in the lower limbs			2
' long term studies have shown that the results are as good as , or better than open surgery and the technique is recommended by @entity129 as the first choice for varicose veins in the leg			0
' @entity132 for veins in the arm is a novel use for this technology and there are very few clinicians offering this procedure in the @entity101			0
' numerous celebrity websites have been quick to dismiss the report that @entity4 would consider such treatment on her arms			2
@entity144 points out that the @entity11 ' regularly publishes and spreads outrageous and false stories about @entity4 's health ' and it 's ' ridiculous ' to believe the actress has a complex about her arms when she ' frequently makes major public appearances in arm - baring outfits '			1
meanwhile celebdirtylaundry.com states that while @entity4 has a track record of having surgery for medical reasons after she had a mastectomy last year to prevent breast cancer , they believe she would n't have cosmetic surgery because it 's ' fraught with risks , and i doubt she 's willing to take them '			1
