@entity0 takes a look at 10 things we learned from the @entity4 and @entity5 this weekend , including why @entity6 is the perfect striker for @entity7 ... 1 ) @entity6 ’s shuffle of feet and close range shot against @entity11 was his second close range finish in two @entity4 games so far			1
that ’s good news for @entity7 fans after their struggles to find a consistent forward last season , but even better is that there ’s more to the £ 30million new recruit than just a bit of goal poaching			1
of the 27 he hit for @entity24 in last season ’s @entity25 , only nine were from ten yards or less			0
goalscorer : @entity6 celebrates opening the scoring for @entity7 in their 2 - 0 win over @entity11 2 ) @entity31 ’s defensive system relies on a midfield man to protect the back three , and nobody could fault @entity34 for effort as the 7.5miles he covered was only beaten at @entity36 by @entity37 ’s 7.8 miles			1
but while 31 - year - old @entity34 might have been chasing the ball he did n’t win it often enough – coming out on top in only four tackles during 90 minutes			1
effort : @entity34 ran 7.5 miles in @entity31 's 4 - 0 loss to @entity43 , but he won just four tackles during the game 3 ) if @entity45 paid £ 27million up front for @entity47 and @entity48 shelled out £ 16million for @entity49 then the £ 6million @entity50 paid for @entity52 full back @entity53 looks an absolute bargain			1
the 25 - year - old who played in five of @entity58 ’s @entity57 games looked outstanding against @entity59 both in defence and going forward – setting up a chance from which @entity62 should have scored			1
he also showed he ’ll be a major threat at set pieces , winning five headers as @entity50 used him as an aerial target both at corners and free kicks			2
value for money : £ 6million buy @entity53 has looked an excellent acquisition so far for @entity50 4 ) at a time when most goalkeepers are happy to punch the ball , @entity72 has brought security to @entity78 ’s defence with his willingness to come out and take crosses to ease pressure			1
the 29 - year - old pole , an inspired free transfer signing by manager @entity84 , caught the ball seven times in the win over @entity88 , and six during last week ’ s triumph at @entity91			2
in contrast the most catches made in a game by last season ’s number one @entity92 was the four he took at home to @entity99 in december , and his average in 26 appearances was just 1.19			0
safe hands : @entity72 has been excellent so far as @entity78 have won both their opening games 5 ) one talent waiting to be found by whoever takes charge of @entity107 is @entity109 midfielder @entity108 who spent the end of last season on loan at @entity113 to get game time after recovering from injuries			1
the tiny 20 - year - old , just 5ft 6ins tall , offered @entity118 home fans one of the few consolations in a 19 minute cameo when he replaced @entity122 against @entity123			2
he found a team mate with a pass on every one of the eight occasions when he got on the ball			0
back : @entity109 midfielder @entity108 looked sharp for @entity107 during his second half cameo 6 ) @entity130 has n’t taken long to get the hang of rotation in his adventures in @entity135 - goalkeeper @entity134 is now the only @entity137 player to have appeared for all 90 minutes in each of their five fixtures so far			2
centre - half @entity140 had been the only outfield player in that category until his red card against @entity144 yesterday			2
that ’s already a big change in policy from last season when six of his @entity137 ’s outfield players appeared in a total of 36 games or more			0
learning on the job : @entity130 is getting the hang of squad rotation through @entity137 's @entity157 campaign 7 ) newly promoted @entity158 must have cursed their luck when the @entity161 fixture list pitted them against all three of last year ’s relegated @entity4 sides in their first four games			0
but what looked a tough start has turned out to be a doddle – the injury time @entity169 own goal that brought a 1 - 0 win against @entity171 made it a hat - trick of three - pointers			1
ironically the only game to spoil the perfect start was a 1 - 0 defeat at @entity177 who like @entity180 ’s team won promotion from @entity182 last season			1
celebrations : @entity158 players enjoy the late winner gifted to them by @entity171 captain @entity169 's own goal 8 ) @entity187 never once named an unchanged side as @entity189 crashed out of the @entity4 last year and his status as @entity193 football ’s new @entity191 has n’t changed much in the @entity161			0
after the opening day defeat at @entity113 he named four new players for the next game , swapped another five in midweek against @entity158			0
@entity197 for @entity198 was the only change before the 5 - 1 hammering at @entity201 , but you suspect that by then the damage had been done			0
tinkerman : @entity187 is yet to name an unchanged side during his time in charge of @entity189 9 ) @entity208 , son of @entity123 legend and now broadcaster @entity210 , is battling to be fit in time to face @entity45 for @entity211 in the glamour tie of tuesday night ’s @entity214 programme			0
that means former @entity217 under 21 keeper @entity216 is likely to continue as stand - in for @entity220 ’s @entity182 side			0
but it ’s not good news for @entity223 as he tries to avoid adding a @entity57 upset to his list of problems – @entity216 kept his second clean sheet in a row as @entity211 held @entity229 to a 0 - 0 draw			1
10 ) @entity231 played in the same @entity233 youth team as @entity234 , but while his mate went on to star in @entity237 ’s @entity57 team he found himself released after two years at @entity238 without a first team game			0
the 19 - year - old , a slimly built striker with pace and a shot in both feet , is fighting back			2
he marked his debut a week ago by coming on with six minutes left and scoring the winner against @entity247 , and his first start by getting the two goals against @entity250 that leaves @entity252 ’s side as the only team in the @entity5 with four wins from four .			0

@entity6 has scored twice in his opening two games for @entity7 so far
@entity34 needs to be *stronger* in the tackle as @entity31 lose 4 - 0 to @entity43
right - back @entity53 looks an excellent acquisition for @entity50
@entity72 looks an assured presence in goal for @entity78
