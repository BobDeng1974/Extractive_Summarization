@entity0 has warned @entity2 fans not to expect too much after the club ’s £ 150million summer spending spree			1
the arrival of @entity6 , @entity7 , @entity8 , @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 has lifted spirits around @entity13 after @entity2 ’s decline under @entity15 and difficult start with @entity17			1
but the @entity18 believes it will take time for all the new players to gel			0
he said : ‘ what the fans are expecting and what i expect are different , i believe			0
the fans will expect a new start of course and with these kind of players a victory			2
you can like our @entity2 facebook page here @entity6 ( @entity35 ) and @entity8 ( r ) pose with the famous shirts as they are introduced at @entity13 @entity0 speaks to @entity6 after hinting he would like to sign the @entity39 striker on a permanent deal ‘ but i know as a coach that when you let go 14 players and buy six new ones you have 20 different relationships in the dressing - room			1
now we have to build up a new one and that always needs time			0
‘ it depends on the personalities of the players			0
we have a lot of @entity56 players who do n’t speak @entity57 so well so that ’s always a difficult part			2
okay , you can say that you know in advance also but you want to buy always the best players for the positions that you need			0
‘ what we have done in the transfer period is very good in spite of the fact we do n’t play in the @entity67			2
the players are coming to @entity2 and that ’s a big plus			1
we have to produce results and that starts against sunday against @entity72			1
’ new signings @entity11 ( r ) , @entity7 ( @entity74 ) and @entity9 ( @entity75 ) join @entity2 teammates for training @entity39 striker @entity6 revealed that he would like to stay at @entity2 for many years multi-talented : @entity8 can play in a variety of positions across defence and midfield , although a central holding role is his preferred position asked how he will fit all his players into the team , @entity17 replied : ‘ i never have said that			1
we shall see who is playing tomorrow			0
‘ for a coach it is always easy because he can decide and he decides what he sees – at least i do			0
i observe and then decide			0
i do n’t have any worries about that			0
i ’ve done that for more than 25 years			0
’ @entity17 was more comfortable with the top - three target set out by @entity2 chief @entity93 when he addressed the club ’s investors in midweek			1
‘ we have spoken about the target when we had the meetings together , ’ said @entity17			1
‘ a club like @entity2 needs to put targets			1
i do n’t think it ’s an unreasonable target			0
whether it ’s difficult is another question			2
a club like @entity2 must always put a target			1
within the three is logical because @entity2 always want to be in the @entity67			2
