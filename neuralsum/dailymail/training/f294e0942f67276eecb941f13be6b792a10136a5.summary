by @entity0 published : 07:07 est , 14 august 2012 updated : 07:53 est , 14 august 2012 wearing a fluorescent jacket and chopping wood with an axe , the man in this photograph may look an unlikely star as he carries out his community service			1
but this photograph captures the moment when a young drug dealer facing a grim future turned his life around and began his journey to becoming an @entity15 champion			1
only nine months after this picture of @entity18 was taken , the 22 - year - old won a gold medal in the boxing ring at @entity21			1
learning the hard way : @entity18 chops wood at an allotment in @entity25 in november last year while completing his community service			1
nine months later , he was an @entity15 champion @entity18 , born in @entity26 , @entity27 , to @entity29 parents , won the @entity15 super heavyweight title by beating @entity32 @entity31 in front of 10,000 fans at the excel centre			1
it was @entity38 's 29th and final gold at the @entity39			2
@entity18 was suspended from @entity41 's boxing squad after he was arrested for possessing cannabis and intent to supply the drug in march last year			1
he appeared destined for jail but a judge gave him a second chance and he was sentenced to a 12 - month community order and 100 hours ’ unpaid work			1

champion : boxer @entity18 celebrates after winning the gold medal in the men 's super heavyweight division at the @entity35 in @entity25 @entity60 , secretary of the @entity61 , said : ' we remember him very fondly			1
we knew him as @entity63 though			2
“ he was extremely popular and charming			1
he was a good steady worker and kept his head down , which is unusual on the scheme , because we get a lot of difficult , reluctant people			2
' he never picked on anyone or bullied any of the other people on the programme , which can happen			2
' small groups of offenders help out at the site , carrying out maintenance work , clearing paths and gardening			2
the scheme has been running for two years and has been credited with transforming the site from a state of neglect to a thriving community allotment			2
ms @entity60 said : ' he ( @entity18 ) was very engaging and got on with everyone , you could tell he had something about him , something different			1
' he was modest and self - effacing but also had a sort of personal invincibility that all good boxers have , without being cocky			2
changed fortunes : @entity18 has turned his life around after being convicted of possessing cannabis with intent to supply ' one funny thing i remember , was when we got him to sort out the woodpile and he was wielding this massive axe , but he was useless at chopping			1
' we teased him that he had all these big muscles but he could n’t do it			0
' he was very good at taking a joke though			0
we taught him in the end			0
' @entity18 has admitted that the community service and the shame felt by his family , friends and his boxing colleagues at his conviction helped convince him to change his ways			1
‘ i could have seen it as a badge of honour , ’ he said earlier this year			0
‘ i could have taken the rap , seen it as a slap on the wrist and done it again			0
it was n’t so much the actual charge that had the effect			0
prize fighter : @entity18 , wearing the blue vest , lands a blow on his way to winning @entity15 gold at the @entity35 in @entity25 ' it was all the grief afterwards , from my friends , from my family – especially my mum – and from boxing			1
‘ i was just like a lot of young lads			0
it was all about how i looked , my clothes , clubbing , girls			0
i was n’t with the best group of people			0
‘ the arrest changed a lot			0
it forced me to grow up and to respect my responsibilities			0
‘ i ’m not happy that i did what i did and there ’s no way that kind of thing will ever happen again , but in a way i ’m glad it did because it woke me up			0
‘ i go running on saturday nights now , not clubbing			0
i understand that if i ’m to fulfil my potential then it ’s all about hard work			2
' it took me a while to realise this , but since last march i ’ve never looked back			0
and you know what ? i ’m so much happier as a person , too			0
