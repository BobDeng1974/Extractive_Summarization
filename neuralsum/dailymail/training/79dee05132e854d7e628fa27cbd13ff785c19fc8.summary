almost 500,000 unemployed people have had their welfare payments suspended for between four weeks and up to three years for breaching rules			1
the @entity3 said that jobseekers can have their benefits stopped if they fail to apply for enough jobs , turn down a job offer , or turn up late or fail to show for interviews at their local @entity9			1
the @entity3 confirmed that 466,000 @entity10 ( @entity11 ) were sanctioned in the year ending september 2014			1
work and pension secretary @entity12 announced today almost 500,000 people on @entity11 have been sanctioned for failing to adhere to the rules governing their attempts to find a new job however , the figure was approximately 100,000 less than the previous twelve months			1
according to the @entity3 : ' sanctions are a necessary part of the benefits system , encouraging people to engage with the support on offer			2
more than 70 per cent of claimants say they are more likely to follow the rules if they know they risk having their benefits stopped			1
' the @entity3 said that staff only sanction claimants as a last resort and only in a small number of cases			0
work and pensions secretary @entity12 said : ' the vast majority of people on benefits want to work - and take up all the support on offer to move into a job			2
we can see this from the record numbers of people in work and falling unemployment			0
' but where people do n’t play by the rules : do n’t accept the support on offer , or refuse to take work , it ’s only right that there should be consequences			2
' sanctions are a key part of the contract we have with jobseekers			0
we must not forget that it is hardworking @entity59 taxpayers who fund the welfare system , and we have a duty to them to ensure their taxes are spent fairly			0
' job hunters can have their benefits stopped for four weeks if they are late for a @entity66 interview the newly released figures show that approximately six per cent of claimants are sanctioned in any given month			1
in total , between october 2013 and september 2014 the 724,000 sanctions were issued against jobseekers			0
some of those jobseekers were sanctioned more than once			0
in the previous 12 months , there were 894,000 sanctions			0
the new figures show that 35 per cent of those sanctioned had failed to actively look for work			2
almost one in three refused to participate in employment programmes to help with job hunting , while just under a quarter - 24 per cent - missed a meeting at the @entity66 without good reason			1
however , the @entity83 warned that benefits sanctions can be counter productive			0
a spokesman said : ' benefit sanctions are disproportionately affecting young people under 25 , and there is evidence of severe impacts on homeless people and other vulnerable groups ; ' international evidence indicates that benefit sanctions substantially raise exits from benefits , and may increase short - term job entry ; but there are unfavourable longer - term outcomes for earnings , job quality and employment retention			2
' there are concerns that welfare conditionality can have unintended consequences , including : distancing people from support ; causing hardship and even destitution ; displacing rather than resolving issues such as street homelessness and anti-social behaviour ; and negative impacts on " third parties " , particularly children			0
' jobseekers can face intermediate and higher level sanctions depending on the nature and frequency of their mistakes			0
intermediate sanctions can see benefits suspended for between four and 13 weeks and can be invoked for failing to show up for interviews , refusing to engage with employing schemes or failing to update a cv			1
the first sanction normally leads to a four week suspension , while a repeat within the same year sees benefits stopped for 13 weeks			1
higher level sanctions apply if someone is sacked for misconduct from their last job , or left the job without good reason			1
jobseekers who fail to apply for suitable positions recommended by @entity66 staff can also be hit with higher level sanctions			1
the first higher level sanction is 13 weeks without benefits followed by 26 weeks for a second error			0
a third higher level sanction within 12 months attracts a three year suspension .			0

almost 500,000 people had their @entity11 stopped last year

suspensions can range from just four weeks to three years
approximately six per cent of job hunters are sanctioned each month
sanctions apply if someone fails to arrive at a @entity66 interview on time
