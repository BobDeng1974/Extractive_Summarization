' a lot of couples sail along and do fine , they do n’t want to rock the boat , but they ’re missing out on the next level of commitment , ' dr @entity6 tells @entity38			1
‘ one of the biggest complaints we hear is that the couple 's " spark " has gone , but by making little changes and creating new habits , you can kick the boredom and monotony out of your marriage and be much happier			1

' by making little changes and creating new habits , you can kick the boredom and monotony out of your marriage ' ‘ gratitude puts things in perspective			1
you ca n’t help but become more satisfied with what you have in your own life			2
’ the book also suggests couples write a letter to someone other than their own spouse , who has been a significant part of their relationship - perhaps a parent they model their marriage on or a friend who gives brilliant advice			2
but instead of sending them the letter , the doctors advise that couples read it to them aloud			2

they have been married for nearly 30 years and a couple for 37 years , as they started dating in @entity103 the book instructs couples to try brand new activities together to recreate the chemistry of when they first fell in love			0
‘ this has been proven to change the chemistry in your brain , ’ says dr @entity7			1
‘ you ca n’t help but come away feeling more energized and excited			0
’ another ' @entity116 ' is ‘ celebrating each other , ’ where the book encourages couples to give more attention and conversation time to positive things that happened to their partner that day			2
' celebrating positive things together greatly strengthens your relationship ' ‘ this shows that you ’re supporting each other , ’ says dr @entity7			1
' it 's not about just taking an interest in your spouse but celebrating positive things together , which we ’ve found greatly strengthens relationships			0
you should be each others biggest cheerleaders			0
’ discussing the future is another vital step : ‘ the moment a couple stops looking toward future , they are defeated , ’ says dr @entity7			1
‘ you have to be able to see where you are headed because , not only is it exciting to have a plan and something to look forward to , but also it certifies your commitment to one another			0
' he suggests that a couple talks about what they want to have accomplished together in five years and where they want to be in ten years , like a business plan but for marriage			0

happily ever after : new book making @entity159 , pictured here , promises to improve your marriage not so @entity161 - inclined ? ‘ feel free to skip this step in that case , ’ laughs dr @entity7			1
finally , though the ‘ @entity54 ’ do not need to be completed in any particular order , the book advises couples to ‘ add value to others , ' essentially asking them to look beyond their own marriage to those less fortune and help them together			0
this could mean sponsoring a child ( something the @entity172 have done and say it strengthened their relationship ) or taking part in a charitable event or activity			0
‘ this is a big step and the effect is immediate , ’ says dr @entity7			1
‘ when a couple reaches out beyond boundaries of their own married life , it adds value to their life and becomes fulfilling			0
’ once the book defines and explains each of these steps it draws out the 21 - day plan , suggesting how a couple can implement certain elements of each ' booster ' to their marriage that day			0
‘ the plan works because couples become conscious of activities they can do together which will bring them closer and make them more grateful , ’ says dr @entity7			1
‘ it does n’t require a major overhaul or a lot of hard work ; it ’s just about paying a little bit more attention to detail and making a little more effort in specific ways			2
' the biggest message of this book , says dr @entity7 , is that marriage does n’t make people happy , it is people that make their marriage happy			1
‘ our research says that when you rely on your marriage as a " happy pill , " you can elevate your mood for two years but , after that , the honeymoon period has worn off and you have to work at it , ’ he says			2
‘ any marriage in any stage can benefit : one that is doing badly will do better and one that is good will become great			0
