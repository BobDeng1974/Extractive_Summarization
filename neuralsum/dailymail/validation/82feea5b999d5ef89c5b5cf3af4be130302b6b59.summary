the @entity0 has spent £ 37million on bombing raids in its mission to smash @entity3 and bring @entity5 's network to its knees			1
an investigation by @entity8 has unveiled the grand scale of the military effort against the terrorist group , including more than 100 airstrikes and 195 missiles fired			1
the bombings , carried out by @entity16 ’s fleet of warplanes and unmanned drones , have targeted more than 180 @entity3 positions and have killed dozens of @entity20 so far in the six - month campaign			1
@entity16 has used @entity36 at least 126 times in attacks on the militants , with each one flown from @entity40 in @entity41 at an estimated cost of £ 35,000 an hour			1
with an average flight time of somewhere between four and eight hours - thanks to the help of @entity47 air - to - air refuelling tankers accompanying them on each mission - the total cost quickly racks up to around £ 26.5million			0
tornados are usually flown in pairs and are equipped with both @entity51 and @entity53 missiles			2
@entity54 - ‘ smart bombs ’ which can pinpoint small targets in crowded areas - have been fired at least 54 times on trucks , buildings and groups of @entity3 terrorists			1
the missiles cost £ 105,000 each and account for another £ 5.67million spent hunting down members of the barbaric group			2
@entity16 has used @entity67 at least 126 times in attacks on the militants , with each raid flown from @entity40 in @entity41 in pairs ( file picture ) weapons : at least 66 500lb @entity73 have been dropped on @entity3 in @entity33 by the eight @entity74 in @entity33 strike : the targeted bombings have killed dozens of @entity20 so far in the six - month campaign meanwhile at least 66 500lb @entity73 have been dropped on @entity3 in @entity33 by the eight @entity49 the @entity0 has sent to the region			1
the heavier weapons are used on larger targets and cost £ 22,000 each			0
because of the threat posed by @entity49 to the @entity20 , they have taken to travelling at night or in poor weather to avoid being seen			0
but this does not stop @entity16 ’s fleet of 10 unmanned reaper drones , which can locate and fire on small targets from as high as 45,000ft , from picking off @entity3 convoys trying to take advantage of poor visibility			1
reapers , which can fly for up to 30 hours before needing to refuel , have fired on the extremists 75 times during the @entity0 mission , which started in october last year			2
during 101 airstrikes on @entity3 in @entity33 , the @entity0 has fired : 75 hellfire missiles 66 @entity53 laser - guided bombs 54 @entity51 missiles the drones use aptly - named hellfire missiles , which can incinerate targets in a burst of flames before they are even aware they are being fired upon and cost £ 46,000 a unit			1
the full £ 37million fight against @entity3 does not include the costs of flying the drones , which are each worth around £ 8.5million , as their operation is shrouded in secrecy			1
the @entity111 does not reveal where the drones take off and land , or even where they are ‘ piloted ’ from - however previous reports suggest they take off from @entity116 and are piloted remotely 4,600 miles away in @entity117			0
in all , the 101 missions @entity8 are aware of have destroyed 186 @entity3 targets , which includes command points , checkpoints and military convoys			0
according to a @entity125 poll , more than 60 per cent of the @entity16 public approve of the bombings in @entity33			2
this is a 10 per cent rise from in september , showing the continued released of brutal snuff videos by the terrorists , such as the sickening beheadings by @entity5 , unveiled last month as @entity132 , have only caused the public to further back the @entity16 mission			0
critics have called for the @entity0 mission to be stepped up , despite @entity136 insisting that @entity16 ’s role in @entity33 is second only to that of the @entity139			1
aerial attack : reapers , which can fly for up to 30 hours before needing to refuel , have fired on the extremists 75 times during the @entity0 mission the @entity144 said the @entity0 ’s role in @entity33 was ‘ surprisingly modest ’ and that the air force was only carrying out one strike a day			1
dr @entity148 , from the @entity149 , said the @entity0 could only play a limited part in the fight against @entity3 without the help of boots on the ground			2
he said : ‘ the @entity0 plays has a small part of the total campaign against @entity3			2
' they 've done a good job but the problem with airpower is the target they face			0
targets have to be fixed unless aircraft react fast to moving targets			0
this is particularly an issue with the predominant use of fast jets rather than close air support aircraft			0
’ ‘ @entity3 have learnt to adapt to the attacks			0
they very rarely move in broad daylight - they do so in bad weather and in small numbers			0
this makes it hard for the @entity0 to find valuable targets			0
' the @entity0 has done as much as it can because of airpower 's limited and perishable impact			0
unless you have ground troops to exploit the impact airpower has , it ca n't be sustained			0
’ @entity16 has also provided 40 heavy machine guns to the @entity183 , who are fighting against @entity3 in @entity33 , but this pales in significance when compared to @entity186 , which has sent more than 35,000 weapons to the fighters			1
@entity16 forces have provided training to @entity192 fighters , as well as sending around 400 support personnel to northern @entity33			2
while the @entity111 does not comment on ongoing operations , its latest update on the strikes on @entity3 says : ‘ military support is just one part of the @entity16 government ’s contribution to the global coalition strategy to defeat @entity3 – we are also taking action to counter the terrorist network ’s finances , are restricting the flow of foreign fighters and have provided vital humanitarian relief to help those affected by @entity3 ’s brutality			1
‘ @entity16 military training teams continue to teach infantry and first aid skills to the @entity183 peshmerga , and liaison teams are embedded within @entity33 and coalition headquarters			2
‘ having previously provided military equipment to the @entity33 forces , @entity16 plans to gift improvised explosive device ( @entity221 ) detectors to help the @entity33 and @entity183 soldiers protect themselves against the numerous improvised explosive devices on which @entity3 are increasingly relying as they are forced back by successful offensives			1
‘ in the @entity228 , the @entity227 ’s type 45 destroyer @entity225 is operating in direct support of the @entity231 ’s aircraft carrier , @entity232 , which provides a significant part of the coalition ’s air effort			0
