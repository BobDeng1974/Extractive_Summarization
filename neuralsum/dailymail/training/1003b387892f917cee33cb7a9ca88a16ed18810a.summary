' @entity66 was unique , he was incredibly generous , very witty and always had time for people ' - @entity28 ' that sounds terrible , but his prognosis was never good and we were really grateful he had that period of good health that we were able to enjoy together as a family			2
' it was really hard but almost immediately @entity215 were there to help			0
a nurse came to visit the next day , she was brilliant , she was great with all the family and quickly got the measure of dad			0
