salivating over tv programmes like @entity1 has become a pastime for many of us - me included			1
i am not especially blessed in the kitchen - my mum still talks about a strawberry cheesecake that emerged from the oven the same sorry shade of grey as over-washed socks			2
but even the most hopeless of cooks can experience a little @entity1 magic on their new food - focused holidays with a winner or finalist from the show			1
even better , the trips are all about eating fine food , not just cooking it			2
heart of the matter : the @entity24 square bubbles and boils with all sorts of foodie delights you can do @entity28 with @entity29 or @entity30 with @entity31			1
i choose @entity33 with @entity34 , joint winner of @entity1 : @entity35 in 2012			1
we roam souks infused with spices before emerging onto the @entity40 ’s chaotic central square , @entity24			2
donkeys and scooters dodge snake charmers , and crowds gather around the dozens of outdoor restaurants where grilled meat sizzles and snail soup bubbles			0
full of flavour : @entity1 star @entity34 shows off a culinary creation ( left ) ; lively @entity24 at dusk ( right ) we journey to saffron farms and @entity55 villages in the foothills of the @entity57 ; tour the city ’s famous sights and its backstreet ovens where families take their dough to be baked			1
we are never far from a foodie treat : tender tagines ; spongy coconut macaroons and streetside mechoui lamb , cooked in an underground pit and served with a sprinkling of salty cumin			0
but we prepare the best meal in the kitchens of our plush riad , the @entity73 les @entity72			0
under the watchful eyes of @entity34 and @entity75 - one of the riad ’s rotund dadas ( cooks traditionally employed by wealthy @entity79 families ) - we go to work ‘ fluffing ’ piping hot couscous			1
later , @entity75 demonstrates how to prepare delicate samosa - like briouats with sweet and savoury fillings like spiced beef and rice with raisins , and a splash of orange blossom oil			0
‘ not good , ’ she tuts , like @entity1 judge @entity89 , at my attempt			1
high society , fine food : @entity94 enjoyed dinner on the rooftop of the @entity73 les @entity98 riad @entity75 was taught to cook at the age of five by her grandmother			0
‘ my recipes have been passed down generations			0
they are all up here , ’ she says , tapping her head			0
a feast is served on the flower - filled rooftop , where storks soar overhead and calls to prayer echo through the air			0
we eat milky camel meat ( tastier than it sounds ) and an aubergine , fennel and blood orange salad prepared by @entity34			1
the briouats are a big hit			0
as @entity120 would say , eating does n’t get better than this ! @entity122 ( 0207 873 5005 ; www.mastercheftravel.com ) offers four - night trips to @entity33 from £ 995 per person , including flights , transfers , accommodation , breakfast and ( some ) other meals			2
@entity34 is accompanying a trip departing november 16 , 2015 , priced from £ 1,395 per person .			2
