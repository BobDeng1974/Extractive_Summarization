out there in celebrity land , in the mink - lined nurseries of the filthy rich , a new breed of fearsomely spoilt children are being raised by their fearsomely spoilt parents			2
these indulged tots are hatched into a world where budgets have no bounds and reality is a misty blur on the ever - golden horizon			2
they are in furs before they are five , @entity17 before six and in bed by seven			2
and while dressed in the finest of clothes , they eat in the best restaurants , are entertained like emperors and hot - housed in luxury that would make a sultan blush			2
meanwhile , the gruesome irony of being given designer shoes before they can walk and expensive birthday parties before they can talk seems to be lost on their crazed , doting , cash - scattering parents			2
you can always depend on @entity44 to raise the pamper bar to hitherto unheard of heights of deluxe lunacy — and this week she did not let us down			2
the 30 - year - old daughter of @entity51 billionaire @entity50 and her husband , @entity52 , have just returned from a holiday in @entity54 to celebrate his birthday			1
before their next holiday , they had the small matter of celebrating daughter @entity34 ’s first birthday this week — and @entity42 was determined it was an event that would never be forgotten			1
not by @entity34 , who is too young to have a coherent thought running through her gorgeous little head			1
but by everyone else who goggled at the £ 70,000 or so spent on turning the front courtyard of their @entity66 home into @entity34 ’s very own petting zoo , complete with puppies , @entity71 ponies and a baby zebra			1
a rather glum - looking zebra , to be honest , but in terms of competitive party - throwing , the little critter certainly earned his stripes			1
there was also a real live princess , complete with a wimple , and a platoon of security men delivering gift - wrapped presents for the lucky baby			2
in pride of place was a rather garish gazebo made entirely of pink balloons with @entity34 ’s initials picked out in white			1
as well as a petting zoo with puppies , @entity71 ponies and a baby zebra , @entity90 was also lucky enough to have a decadent princess palace created out of pink and white balloons if you have ever wondered what a doctor would see while performing liver surgery on @entity101 , wonder no more			1
@entity42 also posted photographs on social media of @entity34 enjoying her birthday breakfast in her couture pyjamas , surrounded by giant soft toys and a whispering forest of helium balloons			1
another gift , wrapped with a pink velvet ribbon , awaited her perusal on her high chair tray			2
what and who was all this lavish fuss for ? certainly not for the child , who would have been as puzzled as the zebra about what was going on			1
however , events like this somehow seem to be more about making an affluent statement than celebrating a birthday			0
that ’s not to say @entity42 is not a lovely mother			1
her utter joy and delight in her baby is clear for all to see			0
yet one wonders what will happen to all these poor little rich kids , barely out of the crib before they are bombarded by all the good things in life — and then some			0
this torrent of luxury is supplied by no doubt well - meaning parents who seem not to know the meaning of restraint , the value of a pound or the concept of modesty			0
few of them have ever had to worry where the next million is coming from and sometimes there is the uncomfortable thought that children are just another accessory , a toy to pamper , a blank canvas upon which they can express how very , very rich they are and how very , very different their lives are from ours			0
a few years ago , women like @entity154 indulged themselves by carrying around teacup dogs in their handbags ; now we have the likes of @entity159 dressing her little girl @entity161 — she was n’t even given the dignity of a decent name — as a mini-me version of herself			0
and you do n’t have to look far to see where @entity42 found inspiration for her sumptuous birthday party			1
last year @entity161 — the child of @entity159 and her husband , the rapper @entity168 — had a first birthday party themed on @entity174 ’s annual @entity173 rock festival			0
there was a karaoke stage , a @entity177 , a groovy three - tier birthday cake decorated with tie - dyed icing — and a very confused little birthday girl herself , togged out in hippie fringes and a headband			0
not only was @entity34 treated to a fancy birthday breakfast in couture pyjamas but she even had a real zebra attend her first birthday party elsewhere , @entity187 and @entity188 gave their daughter @entity189 a horse for her second birthday			1
not just any old nag or cute @entity71 pony			0
@entity189 was given a full blood arabian stallion — and you do n’t get many of them for sixpence			0
‘ @entity202 expressed an interest in having a horse , ’ said an insider , explaining why @entity101 and mrs z went to such extravagant lengths			2
did she really ? the kid probably just shouted ‘ horsey - horsey ! ’ at something on the tv — and the rest is birthday history			0
what on earth are they going to do if she shows an interest in dinosaurs ? the @entity217 — perhaps the @entity219 ’s answer to the @entity220 — once spent a spent a six - figure sum on building son @entity222 a brick castle playhouse , complete with drawbridge and tower , at their old @entity227 estate , just outside @entity66			0
for daughter @entity229 ’s first birthday , they bought her @entity232 ’s @entity231 painting costing £ 600,000			1
the pink heart - shaped artwork , complete with butterflies , now hangs in her bedroom , squeezed in beside her designer wardrobe of gorgeous kidult clothes			0
the @entity240 children , particularly little @entity229 , always look like they have stepped off a kiddie @entity242 catwalk — but what else are rich , fashion - conscious millionaire parents going to spend their money on ? at least they are beautifully turned out — and genuinely look like a loving , well - adjusted family			1
somehow they have negotiated their way through the wealth maze with sense — not everyone is quite so smart			0
when the singer @entity253 and her then partner @entity254 had twins , their godfather @entity256 threw a ‘ welcome to the world ’ party for them			1
the bash cost more than £ 100,000 , not including the diamond rattles he gave them as gifts			2
and there is no shortage of excess with his own daughter @entity266 , the child he had with ex-wife @entity268			1
@entity266 was wearing high heels before she went to school and has a wardrobe of designer clothes that would make @entity273 jealous			1
when her parents split in 2012 , her father bought her a mansion in @entity277			1
not a place for @entity266 , now eight , to live , but as a kind of luxury warehouse to stash and store all the presents and toys he has bought for her over the years			1
@entity42 and husband , @entity52 ( pictured ) , threw a lavish bash this week to celebrate their daughter @entity34 's first birthday as a temple to parental excess , it has no peer			1
still , the new breed of wealthy celebrities are hardly going to be counting out the @entity295 and wondering if they have buttered enough @entity297 sandwiches for their darling little one ’s birthday party , are they ? the impulse of any parent to spoil children and give them the best is understandable — but some extravaganzas go too far			0
@entity308 , in a world long gone , a child ’s birthday party was a simple affair			0
sandwiches and cake , balloons and @entity313 , musical chairs and then home before bedtime			0
younger readers may be astonished by this , but we did n’t even get a party bag			0
if you got a clip on your ear on your way out the door , you would consider yourself lucky			0
look at these children , as the diamonds rain down on their tiny shoulders and zebras clop up to their front doors			0
it might be fun for the doting parents to show off and bask in all the luxury — but what chance do these children have of growing up normally , with even a faint grasp of reality ? answers on a birthday card , please			0

@entity42 had a zebra at daughter , @entity34 's extravagant bash
@entity256 bought a flat in @entity277 , @entity347 for @entity266
while the @entity240 's bought a @entity232 painting for @entity229
