by @entity0 , mail online deputy political editor anyone twice caught carrying on a knife will be automatically jailed , under tough new laws passed by @entity5 tonight			1
@entity7 and @entity8 backbenchers joined forces to see off an attempt by the @entity11 to block the measure after @entity13 claimed it would see gangs forcing innocent victims to carry knives on their behalf			1
mr @entity13 's veto meant conservative ministers were unable to support the proposal			1
but it was passed after @entity7 backbench mp @entity23 tabled the measure anyway - with the tacit backing of @entity27			1
knife thugs will be automatically jailed the second time they are caught carrying a blade after @entity5 backed the @entity7 proposal in the face of @entity11 opposition with @entity8 support the automatic jail rule passed the @entity35 by 404 votes to 53			1
mr @entity23 said the automatic jail sentence would send a clear signal to violent criminals			2
he said : ' some have argued that sending a signal may not be enough , that potential offenders do not think of the consequences of pocketing a knife			0
' quite simply , in the vast majority of cases , let 's face it , to kill someone with a knife you first have to carry a knife , and i believe our courts are dispensing sentences for possession of a knife in thousands of cases that are quite simply treated by offenders as little more than an occupational hazard			0
@entity8 's shadow justice secretary @entity62 said the tough new rules were only introduced because of @entity8 support ' with nearly 8,000 last year being fines and cautions , i would suggest that in some cases that fuels knife crime and does nothing to halt knife crime			0
' under the proposals , adults would receive a minimum six - month jail term on their second conviction for carrying a knife , while 16 - year - olds would be given at least a four - month detaining and training order			2
@entity8 's shadow justice secretary @entity62 welcomed the ruling			0
he said : ' in opposition @entity27 promised that everyone caught carrying a knife would go to jail			1
' after four years as prime minister and four years of broken promises , it ’s not surprising that @entity27 and his ministers failed to support these measures			1
they have only been passed because of @entity8 support			0
' we must send out a strong message that knife crime is unacceptable			0
' now , someone caught , charged , prosecuted and found guilty of carrying a knife for a second time will almost certainly be sent to prison unless there are particular reasons why they should n’t be			2
' there will still be judicial discretion , but the message is clear , those who repeatedly commit knife crime face prison			0
' we do n’t believe this in itself is enough to rid our streets of the scourge of knives , which is why its important work is done with families , schools , colleges and youth clubs to prevent people carrying a knife in the first place			0
