@entity0 insists his long - awaited comeback is still on and is already plotting a route to @entity4 king – and his old sparring partner – @entity6			1
former two - weight world champion @entity0 , now 34 , has not been seen in the ring since he stopped @entity8 in the fifth round of their thrilling clash at @entity13 's @entity12 back in july 2012 since then , two fights with @entity17 rival @entity15 have fallen through , the second of which as a result of shoulder surgery that threatened to end his career for good at the end of 2013			1
@entity0 has vowed to return to the ring after almost three years out of action through injury then , last june , @entity0 revealed that he would fight on and predicted a return to the ring in the following autumn			1
however he is still yet to re-lace the gloves and it has been suggested that he might never do so again			2
but ' @entity0 ' is adamant he will box on , has already set his sights on @entity32 knock - out artist @entity6 and thinks a world title showdown within just 18 months could be possible			1
@entity0 said : ' yes you will see me back in the ring			1
i 've been taking it easy of late as obviously i had a bad shoulder injury so i needed reconstructive surgery on it			1
' that 's good now , i 've got all the movement back and i 'm banging harder than ever with that			2
i 'm just surveying the land at the moment and seeing what 's happening out there			0
' the heavyweight division is looking as good as it has done for a long time			2
you 've got @entity49 still doing what he does , you 've got the emergence of @entity6 , the @entity4 champion , big guy , perfect record			1
he just had a great win and i was in @entity55 when he fought @entity56			2
he looked like the real deal , he really did			0
' @entity0 was last in action when he stopped @entity17 rival @entity8 at @entity12 in 2012 @entity0 knows all about @entity6 having shared the ring with him during training back in 2013			1
footage of that spar can be found on @entity62 and , despite the big gloves and headguard , @entity0 appears to have the @entity32 in real trouble			1
but it is the ' @entity67 ' who now sits on top of the world having beaten @entity71 to win the title , taking his record to 33 wins from 33 fights , with all but one coming inside four rounds			0
@entity0 added : ' he helped me out in the past with sparring so i know him very well and i think that has really spiced up the heavyweight division			1
' i think a great route would be to go to @entity32 and try to navigate a way to the @entity4 title			1
@entity6 is a very good champion and if i start fighting regularly i am probably a year or 18 months away from being in a mandatory position to fight him			1
' i 'm not stupid and i do n't think i will just jump straight in there			0
i think it would be disrespectful to the champions and a bit idiotic of myself to think that just because three years ago i could fight at a good level i can just come straight back ' not even @entity91 can take three years out and come straight in and expect to beat the world			2
' it is almost four years since @entity0 lost a unanimous points decision to @entity49 on a rain - soaked night in @entity95			1
@entity0 twice saw a fight against @entity15 fall through after he suffered injuries in training since then , all seven of dr @entity49 's fights have taken place in @entity102			1
but @entity49 's next outing , a defence of his @entity106 , @entity107 and @entity108 belts against @entity109 , will be at @entity111 's iconic @entity110 on april 25			0
' it makes a change , ' @entity0 said			1
' in @entity32 things are starting to shake up and i think he 's realised by continuously fighting in @entity115 , only @entity115 people watch that			0
' worldwide he does n't do great business and i think he realises time 's ticking and he does n't have many fights left in him			0
for the next couple of years he wants to really finish his legacy with some really big fights			0
if he has to travel he has to and he deserves respect for that			0
' @entity0 was speaking at a visit to the @entity129 in @entity130 as part of @entity132 and @entity134 's launch of ' @entity135 '			2
their aim is to drive more volunteers to help out at similar boxing clubs across the country			0
@entity0 said : ' all of my coaches when i was a kid , from the age of 10 to 20 were volunteers			2
they were n't getting paid			0
out of the goodness of their hearts they came down to @entity150 in @entity151 and trained a bunch of kids			0
' even if you do n't make a career out of it , there is so much badness out there on the streets on a daily basis			2
the more youth centres , boxing gyms and football academies , the more stuff we have for kids , stops them smoking , drinking , smoking weed , taking drugs			0
it 's a slippery spiral			0
' hopefully people listening to me will want to try and help			0
you can go to joininuk.org and see if there is anything you can get involved in			0
' @entity0 wants to plot a route that ends with him challenging world champion @entity6 ( left )			1
