by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 will leave thoughts of the future until after @entity5 completes the defence of his @entity8 title			1
@entity5 has not dropped a set on his way to the quarter - finals , where he is likely to face his stiffest test against 11th seed @entity13 on wednesday			1
the defending champion 's excellence means @entity2 's first experience of being @entity5 's coach at a grand slam has been largely stress - free			1
short term : @entity2 ( right ) is focusing on @entity5 's ( left ) @entity8 title defence future : @entity5 's coach says she will see after the grass court season finishes where she stands decision : the relationship was originally agreed just for the grass court season but could be extended @entity29 training with @entity2 @entity5 and @entity2 's partnership is initially just for the grass - court season , although the idea from the start was for it to develop into something long term provided both are happy with how things go			1
the pair have not had any discussions about the future yet , with @entity2 saying : ' i think we are both focusing on what 's going on here and we 'll see for that later			1

since linking up with tough @entity78 coach @entity77 last october , the 23 - year - old has won titles on all surfaces and reached his first grand slam quarter - final at the @entity82			1
he is now through to that stage for a second time and is on an eight - match winning streak after succeeding @entity5 as @entity87 champion two weeks ago			1

' he makes better decisions on the court than he used to			2
watching him play , his strokes and stuff , technically he has n't made many changes to his game			0
