by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor @entity2 said a @entity4 ruling allowing people to have links removed from the search engine 's index was ' open - ended ' and the law was ' confusing ' web giant @entity12 must not be put in charge of ' censoring history ' , the founder of @entity11 warned today			1
@entity2 said a @entity4 ruling allowing people to have links removed from the search engine 's index was ' open - ended ' and the law was ' confusing '			1
the @entity18 government has insisted it does not amount to a ' right to be forgotten ' and likened to ruling to @entity19			1
the purge of search results ordered by the court applies only to @entity12 's local search pages covering the @entity25 's 28 member nations and four other @entity27 countries , encompassing more than 500 million people			1
but users in @entity27 who switch to the firm 's @entity31 domain , @entity33 , will find unaltered search results			2
the ' right to be forgotten ' is based on the premise that outdated information about people should be removed from the internet after a certain time			2
but after links to stories started disappearing , @entity12 performed a u-turn and began reinstating some of them			2
@entity12 has so far received about 91,000 such requests since the ruling came into force			2
mr @entity2 , who co-founded the free web encyclopaedia @entity11 in 2001 , said : ' the law as it stands right now is quite confusing			1
we have this one ruling of the @entity4 which is very open - ended and very hard to interpret			1
' i would say the biggest problem we have is that the law seems to indicate @entity12 needs to censor links to information that is clearly public - links to articles in legally published , truthful news stories , ' he told @entity60 's today programme			1
' that is a very dangerous path to go down , and if we want to go down a path where we are going to be censoring history , there is no way we should leave a private company like @entity12 in charge of making those decisions			0
' he added : ' i ca n't speak to the position of the company - i am on an external board advising @entity12 , coming up with recommendations for search engines generally , coming up with recommendations for @entity76 as to how to reform the law			1
' mr @entity2 went on : ' there is a sense that one of the big philosophical problems with the approach that has been taken is that the idea of personal data is so broad under @entity27 law , almost anything about a person is considered to be personal data - including that the prime minister is married ; that is personal data about the prime minister			1
' what we need to do when we talk about protection of consumers ... we talk about companies having information and needing to handle it in an appropriate way - we are talking there about private information , your health records , your financial information			0
that 's a completely different category			0
' @entity108 mep @entity107 , chairman of the @entity110 civil liberties committee , agreed that the law is ' confused ' which is based on 1995 data protection laws			0
' that is ancient law as far as technology is concerned - mobiles were around in 1994			0
that tells you where we were			0
' what is currently blocked is the new data protection law which talks not about a right to be forgotten , but a right to erasure			0
what we need is clarification of the law			0
' earlier this month @entity129 dem justice minister @entity128 argued that people do not have an ‘ unfettered ’ right to demand the removal of links to internet articles containing information about them			1
he added : ‘ we have criticised the government of @entity19 ... for closing down people 's right to information			2
there are other countries with strict information access			0
‘ it is not a good position for the @entity25 to be in to look as if it is countenancing restrictions in the access of the citizen to access to information because it could be a very bad precedent			0

*controversial* @entity27 court ruling gave people ' right to be forgotten '
@entity12 has since been sent *thousands* *pf* demands to remove links
@entity11 's @entity2 warns law is ' open - ended ' and ' confusing '
minister @entity128 likened court ruling to @entity19
