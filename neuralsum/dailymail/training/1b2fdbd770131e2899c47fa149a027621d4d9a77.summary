@entity0 is optimistic the future is bright for @entity3 swimming ahead of the @entity4 in @entity5 and the @entity6 in 2016			1
@entity3 's swimmers struggled in the pool at the @entity9 , winning three medals , with only @entity12 's @entity11 , with silver in the 200metres breaststroke , and the now - retired @entity14 , with bronze medals in the 400m and 800m freestyle , reaching the podium			1
the @entity4 often sees new stars emerge and @entity18 is confident of success for the home nations at @entity21 later this month			1
hopeful : @entity0 wants @entity3 swimmers to inspire the next generation of talent the goggles are on : @entity0 will be swimming for @entity27 at the @entity28 eager : the veteran @entity0 says ' it 's great to be part of the @entity4 and to swim for @entity27 ' the 24 - year - old from @entity34 , who will race for @entity27 in @entity5 , said : ' after @entity39 a lot of things changed , we had people coming in , people leave			1
' it was a rebuilding year last year and now everything 's quite settled and in place			2
we 've got a great team around us			2
' and everyone that 's coming through , the younger swimmers , they 're swimming really well			1
' if we have a good games here it will create a lot of momentum going into the next @entity9			1
' @entity54 , the most experienced member of the @entity3 team , returned to @entity39 's @entity56 for the first time for this week 's @entity59 holding camp			1
the 29 - year - old backstroke swimmer from @entity61 , who , like @entity0 , is coached by @entity63 at @entity64 , said : ' a lot of people look back at @entity39 and see it as a failure			1
' there 's nothing but fond memories for me			0
this place is a very special place			0
experience is key : @entity54 believes @entity3 has learned a lot since @entity9 making a splash : @entity54 will also be competing for @entity27 at the @entity4 ' as a team we came away with a few medals , but we 'd have definitely liked a few more			1
' we converted heat swims into semi-final swims , semi-final swims into final swims			0
it 's just that next stage			0
' hopefully in @entity85 we 'll convert more finals swims into podium successes			0
i think that comes with experience			2
' that 's what we 've been working on over the last few years and we 'll continue to work on into @entity85			0
' end of an era : @entity14 retired from swimming after winning bronze at the @entity9 many expected @entity0 to reach the podium at @entity9 after medal success at @entity4 , @entity99 and @entity100 , plus a strong world ranking , but despite reaching four finals fifth was her best result , much to her disappointment			1
for me personally i 've re-evaluated everything that happened in @entity39 , ' added @entity0 , who will compete in her third @entity4 in @entity5			1
at first i was really emotional about it but i 've tried to think logically , take the emotion out of it and just see it as a race that happened			0
i did my best and that was the result i got			0
' i want to get better than that , i want to do better than that			0
i 've reassessed how i lead - up to it , what i can do there , the actual race , how i can change there			0
' @entity0 will have five opportunities in @entity5 in the 50m and 100m freestyle , 50m butterfly , 4x100m freestyle relay and 4x100m medley relay			2
i did five ( events ) in @entity126 , so i 've stuck to that programme , ' @entity0 added			2
' i 'm looking forward to seeing what i can do			0
it 's a good marker , the @entity4 , two years out from the @entity130			1
' the @entity4 is very strong in sprint freestyle			2
it 's going to be hard , but i like a challenge			0
' i just want to work on the processes i 've been doing in training the last couple of years ; there 's a lot of things in my race that could be a lot better			0
' if i get those right i know that i 'll be there or thereabouts in the race for medals			2

@entity0 confident that @entity3 swimming is improving following disappointing @entity9
@entity3 swimmers only won three medals at 2012 @entity130
@entity54 believes experience is the key for @entity153 going into @entity4 and @entity6
