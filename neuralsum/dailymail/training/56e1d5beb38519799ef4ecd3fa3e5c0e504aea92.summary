he wanted to create an @entity2 race of so - called superior beings , but @entity4 and his nazis did n’t stop at humans			1
they were also trying to re-instate prehistoric animals that had been extinct for 9,000 years			1
they planned to bring back wild @entity12 cows - which stood at 7ft to the shoulder and had giant horns - to hunt in ancient forests across @entity16 , new research has uncovered			1
@entity4 and his nazis wanted to bring back the prehistoric auroch cow , a new documentary will reveal next week			1
pictured is a portrait of a @entity21 posing with the skeleton of the creature the documentary , called @entity4 's @entity24 featuring dr @entity25 - a @entity26 , will divulge the efforts his men went to to try and reinstate the creature into @entity16 's forests and next week a new documentary will reveal the previously unknown lengths key @entity21 figures went to in developing their prehistoric flock during the @entity35 , using a process known as back breeding			1
it was all part of the @entity21 obsession with creating a connection to the primeval germanic tribes of history , which they believed would give them added credibility with the @entity47 people			0
and it was overseen by @entity49 – @entity4 ’s second in command and chief huntsman of the @entity21 – who sought a larger and more challenging beast to hunt			1
@entity49 studied ancient documents and cave paintings about @entity12 , which once roamed across @entity16 in earlier times			1
and he planned to breed the animals in zoos before reinstating them in the primeval @entity61 in @entity62 , which was rapidly cleared of its @entity64 inhabitants			0
the project was overseen by @entity49 , pictured with the carcass of a deer , who wanted to create the beasts to provide him with a more challenging animal to hunt @entity49 poses with a line of dead deer - with other @entity5 behind him			1
@entity49 studied ancient documents and cave paintings about @entity12 , which once roamed across @entity16 in earlier times			1
yesterday dr @entity76 , senior lecturer in modern @entity79 history @entity77 , said : ‘ this is one part of a larger story about how the @entity82 sought to give itself a longer history and a credibility and a sense of legitimacy with the @entity47 people by saying they were n’t something totally new but had this 2,000 year history going back to the germanic tribes in the forest			0
' so the creation of these animals is just one part of that effort to give themselves some history			0
‘ for @entity49 , hunting was one of the greatest human activities and he believed there would be a special quality to these particularly wild and ferocious animals			2
' he imagined repopulating large areas of @entity16 with these animals			2
' they were bigger and more atrocious and more vicious and that was one of the attractions , because @entity49 knew hunting those animals would be much more of a challenge than hunting say a fox or a hare			2
it was the ultimate hunting challenge			0
’ dr @entity76 , a history lecturer at @entity77 , will also appear in the show - which will air next week			0
experts will say how the plan to bring back the cows was part on an obsession to create a connection to the primeval germanic tribes of history as with many @entity21 policies , the level of secrecy @entity4 ruled in has made it difficult for historians to make discoveries			1
orders were given verbally and rarely written down and evidence of killings was covered up – by burning bodies and destroying concentration camps			0
but by examining fossilised bones of @entity12 and a war diary kept by a @entity21 unit , researchers have been able to identify the @entity5 ’ plans			0
heck cattle pictured in @entity141 - which look similar to the auroch cows , which would roam across @entity16 in the prehistoric period and they appear to chime with the party ’s ideology about creating racial purity , which saw the execution of 3,300,000 @entity64 during the @entity149			2
dr @entity76 said : ‘ when the @entity5 invaded the @entity152 and captured @entity61 they immediately set it aside and gave it to @entity49 who said let ’s reinstate these animals there			2
' and he said we need to get rid of all the inhabitants , particularly the @entity64			0
so there ’s this connection between the reintroduction of the animals and the extermination of the @entity64			0
' and that ’s what adds a terrible twist to this story			0
’ next week , @entity4 ’s @entity24 will use a combination of old footage and photographs and reconstructed drama to tell of the seizure of the primeval @entity61 in july 1941 and the @entity5 ’ mission to reinstate prehistoric @entity12			1
the documentary airs on tuesday ( june 17 ) on the @entity174 at 8pm .			0
