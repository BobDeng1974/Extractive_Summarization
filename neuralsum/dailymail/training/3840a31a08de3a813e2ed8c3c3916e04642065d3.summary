@entity0 will enter the second leg of their @entity3 semi-final hoping to add @entity4 to their lengthening list of @entity7 scalps in knockout competition			1
since manager @entity10 took over in october 2013 , the @entity9 have developed a reputation as @entity3 fighters and have already beaten @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 in the last 12 months or so			1
in order to eliminate @entity4 and claim their place in the final at @entity21 , @entity0 will have to overturn a 1 - 0 first leg deficit			1

but just as it looked as though @entity13 were gaining the upper hand , @entity65 cut inside from the right and sent an unstoppable left - footed strike into the top corner to send 6,000 travelling fans into dreamland			0
defeated by a @entity9 side who at that point were a mere point above the relegation zone in @entity78 , it came as little surprise that @entity13 were booed off			1

they returned to @entity126 to take on @entity15 in the second round of the @entity3 and once again it was a dramatic night to remember			2
@entity129 headed the @entity15 into the lead five minutes before the break , but @entity132 diverted a cross into his own net to gift a second - half equaliser			2
neither side could claim a winner in extra time and when @entity142 's penalty was saved by @entity143 , @entity140 converted to send @entity0 through			2
it was a small but sweet measure of revenge for 2007 , when the @entity9 were relegated from the @entity7 , largely thanks to @entity147 's exploits for @entity15			2
