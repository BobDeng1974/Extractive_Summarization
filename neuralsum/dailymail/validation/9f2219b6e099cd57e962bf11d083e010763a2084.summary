@entity0 fell cheaply in both innings as @entity2 lost inside three days to county champions @entity4 in @entity5			1
@entity0 , who made just three first time round , mustered five at his second attempt on tuesday morning - before his attempt to dispatch a short ball from @entity10 went straight into the hands of @entity12 at midwicket			0
the @entity15 captain will next week depart for his first international assignment of this @entity17 year - to take on @entity18			1
@entity0 trudges off the field in @entity5 after falling for five following just three in the first innings the @entity15 captain faced 30 balls for his five for the @entity2 as they were easily beaten by @entity4 but he will do so on the back of two failures in his only two first - class innings since last season			1
without a major contribution from him - and despite 74 in the second innings from his fellow , and former @entity15 , opener @entity26 - @entity2 went down by nine wickets			2
they conceded a first - innings deficit of 151 , and then managed only 220 all out next time as @entity10 ( three for 22 ) and @entity12 ( four for 72 ) took the bowling honours - @entity15 's leg - spin call - up finishing with two wickets in two balls			2
@entity4 needed 20 overs under lights against the pink ball in the desert to knock off the 70 required			0
@entity0 's potential @entity15 opening partner , @entity43 , wrapped up the match with 46 not out @entity43 hits through the offside at @entity46 as @entity4 claimed a nine - wicket victory first - innings centurion @entity43 , @entity0 's prospective new test opening partner after being named in the squad to take on the @entity18 , finished the match with successive boundaries off @entity53 for an unbeaten 46			1
the @entity54 therefore started the new season with an emphatic win			0
@entity0 caused a stir last week when he described @entity15 's decision to replace him as their @entity60 captain as " probably wrong " , in hindsight			1
he continued his poor form in a one - day international series in @entity64 late last year , and @entity15 responded by dropping him in favour of @entity66			0
@entity4 opener , @entity43 ( centre ) , at the end of the match as his side needed 20 overs to chase down 70 they went on , however , to make an embarrassing early exit from the global tournament in @entity76 and @entity77 - beating only minnows @entity78 and @entity79 , and eliminated by a defeat against @entity81			0
@entity0 agreed to play for @entity2 against @entity4 at the @entity46 in the traditional curtain - raiser for the new season			2
but there was to be no return to form for @entity15 's most prolific @entity15 centurion - who is without an international hundred in any format since may 2013 .			0

@entity15 captain @entity0 scored three and five for the @entity2
@entity43 , named for @entity15 's @entity18 tour , scored *113* and 46no
@entity4 beat the @entity2 by nine wickets on the third of four days
