@entity0 is an excellent referee but still inexperienced at the very top level dealing with world - class players â€” and he met one at @entity5 in @entity6			1
the @entity8 forward was sharp to intercept a backpass and knock the ball past @entity11 in the @entity13 goal			0
@entity0 was understandably caught a distance from play and either guessed or was advised by his assistant that @entity6 had dived , so he awarded a defensive free - kick and cautioned @entity6 for simulation			0
replays showed that @entity6 had been fouled and @entity8 should have been awarded a penalty			2

@entity32 referee @entity0 *decided* to book @entity6
replays showed that @entity6 was fouled by @entity13 goalkeeper @entity11
@entity0 may have been wrongfully advised by his assistant
