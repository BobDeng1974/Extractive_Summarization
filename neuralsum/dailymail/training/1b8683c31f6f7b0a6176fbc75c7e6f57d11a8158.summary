by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 19:14 est , 13 november 2013 updated : 04:12 est , 14 november 2013 @entity3 governor @entity2 once described the @entity4 as a ' crisis economy ' but he is now optimistic about fiscal growth there is a 50/50 chance that unemployment will fall to the level next year which would trigger a rise in interest rates , the @entity3 has warned			1
governor @entity2 said the economic recovery has finally taken hold , raising the prospect of a rise in the cost of borrowing			0
with the number in work reaching a record high , mr @entity2 said the ‘ glass is half full ’ as output grows at its fastest pace in six years			1
the @entity25 , who took up the job in july and has previously branded the @entity4 a ‘ crisis economy ’ , added : ‘ we have one of the strongest recoveries in the advanced world			2
’ he predicted unemployment is likely to fall by late 2014 to the 7 per cent he has set as a threshold for the bank to consider raising interest rates			1
analysts quickly suggested rates may go up at the end of next year or in 2015 rather than in late 2016 as the @entity3 indicated only three months ago			1
the prospect led to the @entity43 stock market suffering its worst one - day fall for three months with £ 25billion wiped off the value of blue - chip companies			0
mr @entity2 said rates will not need to rise if the cost of living remains under control			0
inflation fell to 2.2 per cent in october – close to the @entity3 ’s 2 per cent target			1
however he also said he was ‘ absolutely ’ prepared to raise interest rates in the run - up to the general election in 2015 if required			0
the @entity3 said there was a 50 - 50 chance unemployment will reach 7 per cent in the final three months of 2014			1
it sparked speculation that rates could rise in as little as 12 months in what would be a blow to millions of borrowers but ease the pain suffered by @entity4 ’s army of savers and pensioners			2
@entity66 , chief executive of mortgage broker @entity67 , said : ‘ there is now growing panic that interest rates might actually rise next year , rather than 2016 as previously indicated			2
’ with investors betting on an early hike , the pound rose sharply but the stock market fell with the @entity75 down 96.79 points to 6630			0
mr @entity2 insisted the 7 per cent threshold set by the @entity3 is a ‘ staging post ’ for reassessing interest rates ‘ not a trigger for an automatic increase ’			1
the @entity25 stressed that although the economy is growing again it has not yet returned to ‘ normality ’ – hinting that rates could stay at rock bottom well beyond the end of next year			0
he said the @entity3 will hold rates down for as long as required ‘ so that @entity4 households and businesses have the confidence not just that the glass is half full but that it will be filled ’			1
mr @entity2 said : ‘ with the recovery taking hold , our task now is to secure it			0
‘ a strong and sustained recovery is needed to put people back in work			0
’ @entity100 shoots : the @entity3 said it expects the economy to grow by 0.9 per cent in the final three months of this year publishing its most optimistic set of forecasts for years in the latest quarterly inflation report , the @entity3 raised its outlook for growth and jobs and lowered its outlook for inflation			1
it came as figures from the @entity111 showed that employment rose by 177,000 between july and september to a record high of 29.95million ; hailing the good news , mr @entity2 said : ‘ inflation is now as low as it has been since 2009			2
jobs are being created at a rate of 60,000 per month			2
the improved outlook is a boost to chancellor @entity120 ahead of next month 's autumn statement ' the economy is growing at its fastest pace for six years			0
for the first time in a long time you do n’t have to be an optimist to see the glass is half full			1
the recovery has finally taken hold			0
’ the @entity3 said it expects the economy to grow by 0.9 per cent in the final three months of this year – building on the 0.8 per cent expansion seen in the third quarter and 0.7 per cent in the second			1
it raised its growth forecast for 2013 from 1.4 per cent to 1.6 per cent and for 2014 from 2.5 per cent to 2.8 per cent			0
mr @entity2 also said inflation – which has been above 2 per cent since the end of 2009 – will fall back to target at the start of 2015			2
the improved outlook is a boost to @entity120 ahead of next month ’s autumn statement			0
the chancellor said : ‘ unemployment is falling , the economy is growing and inflation is down , that shows our economic plan is working and – as the governor of the @entity3 says – the recovery is taking hold			1
’ @entity151 said the good economic news was evidence ‘ tough decisions ’ had paid off			0
but @entity156 shadow chancellor @entity155 said : ‘ after three damaging years of flatlining these growth forecasts are welcome , but for millions of families this is still no recovery at all			0
’ the economy is still 2.5 per cent smaller than it was before the recession struck and the @entity111 employment report showed a record 1.46million people are working part time			2
the average worker has also seen wages rise by just 0.8 per cent in the past year , well below the rate of inflation , as the squeeze on household finances continues .			1
