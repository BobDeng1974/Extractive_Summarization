by @entity0 a homeopathy company has recalled some of their products because they might contain traces of a real antibiotic			2
@entity7 of @entity8 , @entity9 , described the products they 're recalling as not containing antibiotics or antibiotic substances , but now they will now be conducting a voluntary recall of 56 lots of products			1
the recall was ordered when the @entity17 ( @entity17 ) found that the process the company used to make six of its products could have contaminated the products with penicillin			1
@entity7 has performed a voluntary recall of many of its products , as they were found to contain penicillin homeopathic remedies are usually highly diluted and are not supposed to contain any active medicines			1
as a result , the @entity17 has chosen not to regulate homeopathic remedies as they are generally harmless			1
unless they claim to cure a serious condition , such as cancer , the @entity17 does n't usually ask the companies to prove their products are safe or effective			2
the danger with the recalled products is that if they have been contaminated with penicillin , users who are allergic to the antibiotic could have a reaction			0
@entity39 is recalling 56 lots of @entity41 , @entity43 - @entity42 , @entity43 - not , @entity45 - @entity44 , @entity43 - @entity47 - @entity46 , and @entity49 homeopathic drug products in liquid , tablet , capsule , ointment , and suppository forms			1
@entity7 has had to recall 56 lots of products , including creams , suppositories and oral tablets because they could cause an allergic reaction as a result , the @entity17 put out an immediate safety warning for those who might be allergic to penicillin			1
the organisation said : ' the @entity17 has determined that these products have the potential to contain penicillin or derivatives of penicillin , which may be produced during the fermentation process			2
' in patients who are allergic to beta - lactam antibiotics , even at low levels , exposure to penicillin can result in a range of allergic reactions from mild rashes to severe and life - threatening anaphylactic reactions			0
' previous scandals have been caused by homeopathic remedies and medicines containing various ingredients that may be harmful , or have adverse effects			2
for example , some products by the homeopathy manufacturer @entity85 , a company that provides homeopathic remedies to coughs and colds , had unintended ingredients			1
in some cases products were found to contain active levels of zinc , and was linked to anosmia ( a loss of smell ) in some cases			2

based on their specific symptoms , a homeopath will match the most appropriate medicine to each patient			0
when manufactured correctly , homeopathic remedies are generally harmless , mostly just solutions of water or alcohol , possibly mixed into a sugar pill , or something similar			1
homeopathy has been used for more than 200 years in various cultures across the world			0
it was discovered by a @entity124 doctor , @entity123 , who was shocked with the harsh medical practises of the day ( which included blood - letting , purging and the use of poisons such as arsenic )			0
dr @entity123 looked for a way to reduce the damaging side - effects associated with medical treatment			0
he came up with a system of treating ' like with like ' , when a person is given a substance that may cause symptoms is given to somebody suffering those symptoms			0
@entity142 and agitation drinking too much coffee , so according to homeopathy , when made into a homeopathic medicine , coffee could be used to treat people with these symptoms .			0
