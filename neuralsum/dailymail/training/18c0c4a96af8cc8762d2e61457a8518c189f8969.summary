dangerous ? a new bike lane has been dubbed ' suicide alley ' by cyclists who say it takes them towards the middle of a road and past hazards including parking bays design : transport chiefs in @entity11 , @entity12 , say the layout of the newly - painted cycle lane ' meets design guidance and is aimed at accommodating all road users ' they have also expressed fears that anyone opening the door of a parked car , without checking their mirrors first , could knock a rider into the path of oncoming cars , lorries and buses			1
@entity44 , chairman of the @entity45 , said the new lane is potentially deadly			0
government notes say you should n’t put in a cycle lane if it is going to make matters more dangerous , ' he said			0
' there is no buffer zone which means if someone opens a door of a parked car the cyclist is knocked off , so riders are forced to stay outside the cycle lane which is going to upset following motorists			2
' mr @entity44 suggested a wide grass verge could be converted to allow for more off - road car parking , and improve the area for cyclists			1
one motorist , @entity67 , said : ' @entity11 road planners seem to have very little thought for cyclists these days and even less for the motorists			2
@entity72 : cyclists say there is no room for two vehicles to pass on the road without crossing into the cycle lane fear : neighbours living nearby have complained that the lane takes cyclists dangerously close to oncoming traffic ' the law says you can not drive in a cycle way , but with cycle paths on both sides of this road , one almost in the @entity91 , there is hardly room for two cars without driving in the said cycle path			1
' @entity95 knows what will happen if two larger vehicles come towards each other			0
it ’s an accident waiting to happen			0
” another driver said : ' this new cycle lane has been painted on the northbound side to join the one that was already there on the @entity11 - bound side			1
' the absence of centre lane markings and a narrow section near the traffic lights means @entity112 and @entity11 - bound traffic is now vying for the same bit of road			1
' a string of comments have also been left on the @entity118 page with one member complaining she was almost hit by another car driving on her side of the road , while one cyclist said they would be using the pavement because it is safer			0
guidance : a council spokesman said the lanes were there for ' guidance ' , and that road users should be aware of others around them worry : fears have been raised that anyone opening the door of a parked car , without checking their mirrors first , could knock a rider into the path of oncoming cars , lorries and buses council spokesman @entity144 defended the layout			1
' the omission of centre lines from urban roads is encouraged by central government as it has a positive impact on reducing vehicle speed , ' she said			0
' the overall width of @entity153 has not been reduced , but a cycle lane has been added to accommodate cyclists travelling up the hill			2
' it is an advisory cycle lane , which means it is there for guidance only			2
it does not mean road users - whether cyclists or motorists - should stop being aware of each other as they travel along @entity153			0
' the width of the @entity153 - with the added cycle lane - meets the design guidance if the council were building a new road			1
' apart from playing an important role in drainage , the grass verge to the side of the road is banked in parts which means it could not all be removed to accommodate a cycle lane			0
' we would also always ask drivers opening car doors to check for cyclists in their wing mirrors , as required by the @entity183			1
' the parking bay along the road was provided following local surveys			0
the layout will be monitored and reviewed over time however and alterations could be considered in the future			0
