by @entity1 reporter published : 01:09 est , 26 june 2013 updated : 01:10 est , 26 june 2013 it may look harmless but the tiny bark beetle , roughly the size of a grain of rice , has been blamed for causing mass devastation in the @entity9 wildfires			2
the winged pine beetles have killed off millions of acres of woodland , creating wide stretches of tinder - dry dead trees to feed the fires			1
more than 75,000 acres have already been scorched in southwest @entity9 , forcing 600 people to be moved from their homes in what is considered the worst fire to have hit @entity19			1
tiny danger : bark beetles , such as the red turpentine , kill off pine trees and create ideal wildfire conditions despite about 900 firefighters trying to halt the fire , it is unlikely that it will be contained until there is rain and a drop in temperature			1
scientists say that mild winters are partly to blame for the infestation of beetles , and the subsequent wildfires			0
' the culprit here is the unusual weather conditions , which might become the new norm with climate change , ' @entity38 , a retired @entity39 researcher , told @entity45			0
after months of drought and a mild winter , the temperature has not dropped enough to kill off the insects , which has created conditions favorable to beetles and wildfires			1
the wildfires and beetle outbreak are considered to be an effect of climate change			0
a similar link between the two was made in 1988 , when more than a million acres around @entity59 caught fire			2
' independent of what the beetle had done in certain areas of @entity59 , the whole thing went up in flames , ' mr @entity38 said			0
' you can point your finger in various directions			0
it might be the mountain pine beetles , or it might be lack of response to a lightning strike			2
but really what was driving that was unusually dry weather conditions , and that 's what 's happening in @entity9			2
' the beetles , which are about 3mm to 8mm long , can be found from @entity79 to @entity80			0
they like to feast on lodgepole pines , which they burrow into			0
devastation : about 900 firefighters are working to contain the wildfires that are sweeping through @entity9 once inside , the beetles eat the inner bark and lay eggs , creating an infestation that eventually kills the tree			1
since 1996 the beetles have attacked almost 3.4 million acres in @entity9 , and 3.7 million acres in @entity92 and @entity93			2
scientists are still debating how beetle damage increases the risk of wildfires			0
if a tree killed by the beetles loses its flammable pine needles , or falls , which creates distance between the trees , the risk of fire is reduced			1
' there could be cases where a bad beetle outbreak could have a big effect , or there could be cases where it would have little effect or almost no effect , ' @entity104 , a professor of fire science at @entity106 , said			0
a co-author of a @entity118 paper that examined the impact of bark beetles , has also said that drought rather than beetle damage was the main cause of wildfire			1
' it ’s natural enough to look at a landscape that is covered with trees recently killed by bark beetles and , therefore , worry about fire risk , ' @entity125 , assistant professor of geography and biology at @entity128 in @entity129 , told the @entity134			1
' but if you look into the long - term ecology of these forests , there is a high fire risk under drought conditions , even when the trees are green and the landscape looks beautiful			1
” tell tale signs : a forest ranger points out evidence of bark beetle damage in a pine tree forest officials have been trying to halt the progress of the beetles by removing infected trees , spraying pesticides or felling mature lodgepole pines which are favored by the beetles			1
killing the beetles off entirely is not an option however			0
by killing off the pines , which then catch fire , seeds are released from lodgepole pinecones			0
' there 's a school of thought that says without the mountain pine beetles , we would n't have lodgepole pines , ' @entity160 , a forest ecologist at the @entity161 , said .			2

more than 75,000 acres *destroyed* in worst fire to hit @entity19 forest
beetles burrow under pine bark and kill trees from inside
dry dead trees and drought *combine* for *perfect* wildfire conditions
