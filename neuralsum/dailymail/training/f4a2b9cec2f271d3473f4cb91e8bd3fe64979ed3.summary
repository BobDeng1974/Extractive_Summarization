by @entity0 , mail online deputy political editor @entity2 today called on @entity4 drugs giant @entity3 to ramp up its commitment to @entity6 before bidding again for rival @entity6 firm @entity7			1
the prime minister said he was ' not satisfied ' with the @entity4 company 's promises to safeguard @entity6 jobs			1
he told @entity12 : ' i want more			0
' mr @entity2 said he agreed with @entity15 dem business secretary @entity14 who yesterday refused to rule out intervening to block a formal bid			2
@entity2 rejected @entity18 's accusation that he was acting as a ' cheerleader ' for @entity3 's in its bid for @entity6 's @entity7 @entity2 was prepared for @entity18 's assault on his handling of the bid - accusing labour of setting up the rules governing foreign takeovers but he warned the row must not trigger a retreat to protectionism			1
mr @entity2 said the @entity6 ' benefits massively ' from foreign companies investing cash in @entity6			1
his remarks came after @entity33 leader @entity18 said there was ' deep concern ' over the proposed takeover of @entity7 by @entity3			1
mr @entity18 said : ' the deal would have an impact for decades to come on @entity6 jobs , @entity6 investment , @entity6 exports and @entity6 science			2
' the @entity33 leader called for an independent assessment of this bid and whether it is in the national interest			2
but the prime minister said : the assessment i want is from the business department on this deal or , indeed , because there is n't now an actual offer on the table , any subsequent offer			1
' mr @entity2 said the commitments made so far by @entity3 - including keeping at least 20 % of the research and development workforce in the @entity6 - were ' encouraging '			1
but he added : ' let me be absolutely clear , i 'm not satisfied , i want more			0
but the way to get more is to engage , not to stand up and play party politics			0
@entity33 leader @entity18 went on the attack during prime minister 's questions - demanding an independent assessment of the @entity4 bid to see if it is good for @entity6 ' the more we can do to strengthen the assurances the better			1
' @entity7 has so far resisted approaches from its rival			0
but the @entity4 giant has not given up hope of completing a Â£ 60 billion - plus deal - potentially the biggest ever foreign takeover of a @entity6 company			1
fears have been raised that resulting cost - cutting could cause the loss of thousands of highly - skilled jobs and undermine the @entity6 's science base			2
mr @entity2 dismissed suggestions from @entity33 leader @entity18 that he was ' cheerleading ' for the deal by tasking the cabinet secretary and ministers to discuss the situation with both companies			1
he said : ' we are fighting for @entity6 science and i just think it is a pity that he is trying to play politics rather than backing the @entity6 national interest			2
' i will judge all these things about does it expand @entity6 jobs , @entity6 investment , @entity6 science ? ' the prime minister said the country must not close its doors to foreign investors			1
' @entity6 benefits massively from being open to investment			0
@entity103 is now producing more cars than the whole of @entity106 , " he said			0
' @entity109 , under @entity108 ownership , has created 9,000 jobs in the @entity111 since i became prime minister			2
' @entity113 and indeed @entity7 have benefited from the backing of an open country to go out and build and buy businesses around the world			0
' there is more inward investment into @entity6 today than the rest of the @entity121 combined			0
do n't let 's put that at risk			0
' the @entity112 also said it was ' absolutely right ' for cabinet secretary sir @entity127 - @entity6 's top civil servant - to engage with both companies			0
mr @entity2 said : ' our entire approach is based upon trying to secure the best possible deal in terms of jobs , investment and science			0
' that is why i believe it was absolutely right to ask the cabinet secretary to engage with @entity3 , just as we 're engaging with @entity7 and i do find it extraordinary that we have been criticised for this			0

the prime minister says offer on the table ' encouraging '
but *reveals* he is ' not satisfied ' and wants more safeguards
@entity33 accuse @entity2 of ' cheerleading ' for @entity4 company
@entity18 demands independent probe of bid to see if it is good for @entity6
