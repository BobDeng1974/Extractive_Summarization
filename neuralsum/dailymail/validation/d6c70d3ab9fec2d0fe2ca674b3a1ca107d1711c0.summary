' and once i go , four or five go with me			0
it does n't look good at all but that 's part of the game			2
we 'll match it if people want to mix it , that 's part of our game as well			2
' there was an awful lot going on but â€Ž i do n't think anyone got caught up in it			0
' once they 're charging the ref , the only thing we can do is respond			0
you ca n't as a group of players let them surround the ref , trying to get our players booked			2

' coming from them ? ' , was @entity0 's initial response			1
the @entity3 captain added : ' i do n't want to get involved in a row but as a group it 's difficult			1
it 's there and you have to stick up for your team - mates			1
' the fans want to see that and that 's the same with every side			1
every other side is as bad as each other			2
it 's part of the game			0
it 's maybe an excuse they 're looking for but certainly not from our point			0
' it made for a disappointing night for @entity88 's players , dumped out on away goals despite leading twice and left to focus on the title race			1

' we 've got the @entity136 in the pocket and the @entity138 is a massive one to go for			0
we 're a few points clear and we need to keep that gap and maintain it			0
we can only do that by responding and doing that the right way and coming back here and picking up three points			0
' the manager said then if we can win the @entity136 and the @entity138 , it will be a very successful year			0
there is an awful lot to do but it 's in our hands and we have to respond			0
we 've got four or five days until sunday 's game			0
' [ we will have a ] couple of days warm down , train and then pick ourselves right back up			0
as a group of players , there 's enough experience in the squad to rally round and get everyone going again			2
' there will be no @entity161 teams in the last eight of the @entity11 unless @entity163 or @entity164 can overturn first leg defeats next week in @entity166 and @entity167 respectively			1
@entity0 said : ' we 've had our fair share of maintaining interest for @entity161 sides in the competition over the years			2
it 's disappointing to go out early			0
it 's different for us , we 're normally in the hat for the next round for sure but from the club 's point a view and the players and the fans , we 're obviously really disappointed			2
