several data protection authorities across @entity14 are now considering whether the policy is compliant with their own national legislation			0
’ ‘ as this is an ongoing investigation it would not be appropriate to comment further			0
’ a @entity1 spokesman said : ‘ our privacy policy respects @entity14 law and allows us to create simpler , more effective services			1
‘ we have engaged fully with the @entity193 ( @entity194 ) involved throughout this process , and we ’ll continue to do so going forward			0
