when @entity1 posted a video online of how she fitted her life into an apartment the size of a walk - in closet , she was an inspiration to penny - pinched tenants across the world			1
but now the professional organiser has moved out of the home - where she could not sit up in bed and had to store bananas in her microwave - for an apartment more than five times its size			1
ms @entity1 , who is also a writer and artist , had paid just $ 700 a month for the 90 - square foot home in one of @entity20 's priciest neighbourhoods			1
in 2010 , ms @entity1 posted a video of how she worked with the pokey space , receiving millions of hits from impressed viewers			1
the ' microstudio ' , which was lined with clearly - labelled storage boxes to the ceiling , had no kitchen			2
instead , she relied on a miniature fridge and would use a toaster over and hot pot to cook meals			0
she also owned just two plates , one fork and one spoon , to save on space			0
massive upgrade : ms @entity1 has now moved into a 500 - square ft apartment just two blocks away she climbed a ladder to get into bed , where she slept with her face just inches from the ceiling			1
it was so cramped she suffered a panic attack on the first night she slept there			0
in her bathroom , which she claimed was ' pretty big ' for the size of the flat , she had to be careful not to bash her knees on a cupboard as she sat sideways on the toilet			1
by the bathroom door , ms @entity1 stored her clothes behind a curtain , and would regularly fillet the wardrobe to make sure it did not grow beyond the boundaries of its small space			1
the ' living room ' was little more than a chair by the window with a reading lamp			0
genius : in her old apartment , ms @entity1 cleared out furniture and made sure she stored upwards inventive : with no kitchen in the tiny flat , @entity1 bought a miniature fridge and stored fruit in the microwave ' i looked at the space like a challenge			1
i knew i could make it work , ' ms @entity1 , 42 , told the @entity88			2
' i never felt cramped			0
i also never thought i ’d stay five years			0
' @entity1 said it was help from her father - a bankruptcy lawyer - and her grandfather - who survived the @entity94 - that taught her to live frugally			1
' how much stuff do we really need ? it 's less than you think , ' she said			0
but she needed to look for a new place after her landlord saw the video she had made about the tiny space last summer and kicked her out - as she was illegally subletting			2
cramped : @entity1 demonstrates how close she slept to the ceiling			1
the first night , she had a panic attack balance : using the bathroom , which @entity1 claimed was ' pretty big ' , proved to be tricky business ' i did n’t even know it			2
now my landlord said he will renovate the space and up the rent to $ 1,200 , ' said @entity1 , who as a professional organiser has worked for celebrities including @entity114			2
ms @entity1 told @entity115 she had been living with her uncle in the @entity117 , @entity20 when she heard about her old apartment			2
' a friend told me that if @entity120 stretched his hands out he could touch both the walls , ' she said			0
prime location : @entity1 loved the area of the flat , which was just one block from @entity127			1
she saved so much money on rent she can now afford a 500 - square ft apartment in the same neighbourhood privilege : @entity1 paid just $ 700 a month - but now the landlord is raising this to $ 1,200 a month she spent around $ 1,000 on shelving , the bed and other storage units to make it as homely and manageable as possible			1
her new apartment is just two blocks away - and friends have joked about how she will cope			0
' everyone is teasing me - what i ’m going to do with all that space , ' she told the @entity88			0
' i ’m going to bounce off the walls , i guess			0
' see below for video			0

@entity1 posted a video showing how she dealt with the 90 - square ft flat
*installed* a bed just inches from the ceiling , stored fruit in the microwave and sat sideways on the toilet
the low cost meant she could afford a 500 - square ft flat two blocks away
