by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 16:04 est , 30 june 2012 updated : 12:56 est , 1 july 2012 referendum ... just not yet : @entity3 has promised the @entity4 a vote on whether to remain in @entity6 if he is voted in again at the next election @entity3 paved the way for a historic popular vote on @entity4 ’s role in @entity6 as his foreign secretary said there was a ' powerful case ' for letting the public decide			1
the prime minister yesterday indicated he is ‘ opening the door ’ to a referendum			1
and he was backed by @entity18 , who this morning said a move by @entity6 towards a federal state to solve the eurozone crisis could trigger referendum			1
asked about the @entity24 's moves towards closer union , mr @entity18 told @entity27 's the @entity26 : ' if it changes in that way and once we know whether we can get a better relationship with @entity6 then that is the time to make the case for a referendum or if there is a clear division between the parties to decide in a general election			1
' that is the time , not now			2
' voters could be asked if they want the @entity4 to stay in or out of the @entity24 , or to sever many of its existing ties with @entity42			0
the prime minister is gearing up to resolve the matter once and for all – but not yet			1
he is considering turning the next election , due in 2015 , into a vote on @entity4 ’s membership of the @entity24 – or holding a referendum afterwards if he is still in @entity49			2
mr @entity3 believes it is too early to decide the crucial question to be put to voters : whether it be a straight ‘ in or out ’ choice , or a proposal to grab back some of the powers lost to @entity42 bureaucrats			1
and he believes it would be a mistake to hold such a vote before the dust settles over the euro crisis			1
a source close to the prime minister said : ‘ it is time to open the door on this matter and consider a referendum			1
it could either be a standalone referendum or it could be part of the conservative manifesto at the next election			2
’ explaining why mr @entity3 has not yet decided on the wording of the question to be put to the nation , the source added : ‘ now is the wrong time when @entity6 is in flux and the whole continent is changing before our eyes			1
‘ we need to see where everything ends up before we consult the @entity4 people			0
’ mr @entity3 ’s hand has also been forced by the financial crisis in the eurozone , which is forcing member countries to negotiate ever - closer ties			2
the accelerated integration is likely to lead to full - scale treaty renegotiations in the coming years			0
breaking up is hard to do : the referendum would be the first time to question of @entity6 has been put to the public since 1975 , when voters backed the @entity4 's continuing membership of the bloc although cynics will describe the referendum as another @entity97 following the @entity99 measures such as the ‘ pasty tax ’ and the aborted 3p petrol duty , the pledge is the latest evidence that mr @entity3 is increasingly turning his attention to political life after the @entity105			1
if he does call an referendum , it is almost certain that arch - europhile @entity109 leader @entity108 would be on opposite sides to mr @entity3			2
foreign secretary @entity18 said there was a ' very powerful ' case for a referendum if @entity6 moved towards a federal state recent polls show a majority of voters want a referendum , and a significant number are ready to turn their backs on the @entity24 completely			1
however , the result would not be certain			0
in the run - up to the last referendum on @entity6 in 1975 , surveys suggested a ‘ no ’ vote , but in the event , the public decided against going back on @entity4 ’s decision two years earlier to join what was then known as the @entity131			1
mr @entity18 reiterated mr @entity3 's desire to hold a referendum , but said he did not favour a straight ' in or out ' vote in favour of a more nuanced question when it was clear what shape @entity6 would take following this current euro crisis			1
he told @entity27 's the @entity26 this morning there would be a ' very , very powerful ' case for a referendum if @entity6 moved towards a more federal system , as expected in response to the eurozone turmoil			1
but he said the government wanted to see whether it could negotiate a better relationship between the @entity4 and @entity42 , with the return of powers , before putting the matter to the @entity4 people			2
' what the prime minister is saying is that the time to decide on a referendum or a general election on our relationship with @entity6 is when we know how @entity6 is going to develop over the coming months and years to the eurozone crisis , and when we know whether we can get that better relationship			1
' mr @entity3 would be setting out his position on a referendum in more detail in the autumn , mr @entity18 said			0
mr @entity3 ’s pledge comes in the face of intense pressure from @entity170 backbenchers to give the public a vote			0
last week , 100 @entity170 mps – more than half of all backbench conservatives – sent a letter to the prime minister which argued that there was ‘ a consistent majority in this country who believe that the @entity24 meddles too much in our everyday lives , that the regulation on our businesses is too burdensome , and that the cost of membership is far too high ’			1
coalition tensions : if a referendum is called , arch - europhile @entity109 leader @entity108 would be on opposite sides to mr @entity3 they also pointed out that the @entity24 is ‘ very different ’ from the @entity131 that @entity4 originally signed up to – and that no one under the age of 55 has had a vote on the nation ’s membership			2
the picture appeared confused on friday when mr @entity3 emerged from a marathon @entity42 summit on the euro crisis to say : ‘ i completely understand why some people want an in / out referendum – some people just want to say , “ stop the bus , i want to get off			1
” ‘ i completely understand that , but i do n’t share that view			0
i do n’t think it ’s the right thing to do			0
there are other things i would like us to get out of			0
that ’s the trouble with the in / out – it only gives you two options			0
’ newspapers interpreted the remarks as a sign that mr @entity3 had ruled out a vote on the @entity4 ’s membership of the @entity24 , while @entity221 , one of the signatories to the backbenchers ’ letter , said it showed that mr @entity3 was ‘ on the wrong side of the argument ’			0
furthermore , ministers were increasingly worried that @entity229 leader @entity228 might outflank mr @entity3 by pledging a referendum if @entity229 won power			0
mr @entity3 has hardened his stance in an attempt to seize back the initiative			0
in addition , mr @entity3 faces a growing election threat from the @entity237 , which has overtaken the @entity109 in some opinion polls			0
worryingly for the pm , many eurosceptic @entity170 voters are switching to @entity241 and its populist leader @entity242			0
there are also persistent rumours that some @entity170 mps could defect to mr @entity242 ’s party			0
more than 80 @entity245 defied @entity247 to demand a referendum on @entity6 during a major @entity249 last year			2
growing election threat : @entity251 burns his conservative membership card at demonstration by @entity241 supporters including the @entity241 leader @entity242 , pictured right , at @entity256 , @entity257 government insiders say the most likely outcome is a 2015 @entity170 manifesto pledge seeking approval to renegotiate the terms of @entity4 membership of the @entity4 if mr @entity3 wins the election			0
this could see @entity42 bureaucrats stripped of their power to decide legal , social and employment rights in this country			0
alternatively , he could promise to hold a referendum along the same lines – or offer a straight in / out vote – if he is returned to power			2
by then , it is possible that the @entity24 landscape could have changed beyond recognition – and public opinion with it			0
@entity279 is already teetering on the edge of leaving the single currency bloc , and there is speculation that @entity284 , @entity285 and even @entity286 could follow it in the coming years .			1

prime minister undecided if vote should be straight ' in or out ' or a question of what powers to grab back
best time for a referendum would be when dust settles on euro crisis , no 10 sources say
foreign secretary said move to a more federal @entity6 to solve single currency turmoil would make a ' very , very powerful ' case for a referendum
