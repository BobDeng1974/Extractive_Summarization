they were feared as barbarians who built one of the largest empires in the world from horseback , but it appears the @entity8 emperors were also some of the planet 's biggest polluters			0
a new study into the silver mines of @entity13 , the grandson of @entity14 , shows that the people produced four times as much pollution as modern industrial mining activities			1
it is thought to be one of the few examples where pre-industrial period pollution has exceeded modern day levels			2
@entity13 ( above ) , the grandson of @entity14 , founded the @entity25 during which pollution from silver mining activities in the @entity29 region of south west @entity30 increased to four times modern levels geologists from the @entity33 and the @entity34 have found pollution from heavy metals like lead , zinc and cadmium spiked between 1271ad and @entity40 in the @entity29 region of south west @entity30			1
he was one of the most feared warriors in history , waging bloody war across @entity45 and @entity46			0
but @entity14 â€™s 13th - century rampage may have never happened had it not been for a spell of good weather			0
the leader of the @entity53 armies created a vast empire that eventually stretched across @entity30 , @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity46			1
historians used to think his armies of nomadic horsemen were fleeing the bleak , cold and dry @entity8 plains for warmer regions			0
but now scientists have discovered that the rise of the @entity64 coincided with a 14 - year spell of weather that was the warmest and wettest for 1,000 years			2
the academics , from @entity68 in @entity69 , discovered the weather anomaly by studying the rings of ancient trees			0
they think the conditions created those needed for a boost in lush growth of grass , which would have fuelled the soldiers ' horses and fattened their livestock			0
the good weather lasted from 1211 to 1225 - the exact period when @entity14 and his armies rose to prominence			0
they say that this pollution was caused by large amounts of silver smelting driven by the @entity8 hunger for the precious metal , which they used to make coins , jewellery and art. writing in the journal @entity97 , @entity98 , who led the work , said that the impact of this pollution was still being felt today by the wildlife and environment in the area			1
she said : ' culminating during the rule of the @entity64 , known as the @entity25 , these metal concentrations approach levels three to four times higher than those from industrialised mining activity occurring within the catchment			1
' notably , the concentrations of lead approach levels at which harmful effects may be observed in aquatic organisms			0
' the persistence of this lead pollution over time created an environmental legacy that likely contributes to known issues in modern - day sediment quality			2
' miss @entity125 and her colleagues extracted sediment cores from @entity128 in @entity29			2
the mud within these sediments catalogued around 4,500 years of debris deposited on the floor of the lake			0
by scanning the cores for heavy metals they were able to determine how pollution levels had changed through out the areas history			1
in 1500bc they noticed a rapid increase in copper levels in the silt - marking the onset of the @entity143 in southeast @entity45 and the birth of metallurgy in the area			0
they say that from around @entity149 there was an increase in lead , silver , zinc and cadmium , all linked to the smelting of silver			0
this map shows @entity128 in south west @entity30 where @entity53 rulers caused heavy pollution by mining silver the researchers took sediment core samples from @entity128 ( pictured above ) in @entity29 , south west @entity30 the @entity53 's @entity25 prized silver for coins and jewelry similar to the belt shown in the picture above however , the levels of pollution remained relatively low until @entity170 , around the time when @entity13 founded the @entity25 and became @entity172			1
the @entity64 are thought to have established the first government operated silver mine in @entity175 in 1290ad and taxes from silver production came to account for 47 per cent of the national revenue			2
silver smelting ( shown above ) can release heavy metal pollutants like lead into the environment the @entity25 remained in power until @entity40 when they were defeated by the @entity184			1
the researchers found that lead pollution in @entity128 peaked at 119 micrograms per gram of sediment in @entity188 before then declining to to around 30 micrograms per gram in @entity189			1
by 1980 they had reached fallen to 8 micrograms per gram of sediment			0
however , @entity190 is known to be particularly rich in mineral resources and has large deposits of copper , tin , gold , silver and iron , and mining activity continues there today			1
miss @entity125 said : ' our findings are unique - while pre-industrial pollution has been detected in lake sendiments over many time periods and regions of the world , only a few studies have found pre-industrial pollution levels to be greater than the modern and none of these have been in @entity30			1
' modern pollution issues rest on a long history of decline in sediment quality at @entity216			2
' a study of @entity219 wetlands documented that the persistence of lead in sediments impacted organisms several centuries after mining activity was reduced			0
similarly , we suggest that the elevated concentrations of lead due to the environmental legacy of @entity53 silver mining has impacted the lake for several centuries			1

geologists have found @entity53 silver mining produced four times as much harmful heavy metal pollution than modern industrial mining activities
the scientists examined sediment from lakes in @entity29 , south west @entity30
the @entity64 oversaw large scale silver mining and smelting in the region
their silver smelting activities caused pollution levels to peak in @entity188
smelting silver causes other heavy metals to leach into the environment
scientists say the heavy metals are still *damaging* the environment today
