this was the year we ’d be wearing shoes that tied their own laces — or so the @entity6 films predicted in the @entity7			1
while this may seem as fanciful now as it did then , 2015 does looks set to be the year of so - called ‘ wearable technology ’ , clothing and accessories that could transform not only our wardrobes , but our health , too			1
until now , wearable technology has largely taken the form of wristband trackers — such as the @entity19 ( launched in 2008 ) , 2011 ’s @entity20 and the much - hyped @entity21 , due to go on sale on april 24			1
but now , manufacturers are developing everyday items of clothing and shoes that can monitor our vital signs , and even treat serious conditions			0
the latest innovations include a bra that could deliver life - saving breast cancer medication and socks that warn if you ’re at risk of injury			1
hi - tech : a bra contains technology which allows tiny ‘ nano ’ particles of a substance - for instance , a drug - to be embedded into a material even big brands are moving into the market — this year , the @entity46 designer @entity45 will launch a sports top that monitors heart rate , muscle movement and calories burnt			1
‘ so far , wearable technology in the context of well - being has been mainly about monitoring personal data , ’ says @entity53 , course leader in @entity54 at @entity55 , @entity56			1
‘ the question now is what do you do with the data once you have it ? is the information of value ? ’ this is where the latest technology comes in , with the focus on giving you feedback from the information collated			1
so in theory , ‘ wearables ’ , as they ’re known , will not only take your blood pressure reading , they ’ll tell you if it ’s dangerously high			1
‘ the holy grail of wearable technology is something that ’s integrated seamlessly into something you wear or use already , so you do n’t notice it ’s there , ’ says @entity53			1
this is now closer to being a reality because circuitry can be made small and light enough to be embedded in clothing			0
another material technology , known as micro-encapsulation , allows tiny ‘ nano ’ particles of a substance — for instance , a drug — to be embedded into a material so it is gradually absorbed through the skin when worn			1
here , we look at the latest ‘ wearables ’ — some of which are already available , with others still being developed — that could transform our health			1
the @entity111 top has sensors woven into the fabric in the chest to monitor heart rate and breathing @entity117 the @entity119 bra contains micro-encapsulated ‘ bubbles ’ of the drug @entity124 in soft , plastic inserts in the cups			1
the idea is that the body ’s heat and moisture rub off the bubbles ’ coating and the @entity124 , which blocks oestrogen to slow the growth of cancer cells , can be gradually absorbed through the skin throughout the day			1
the bra was developed by @entity135 , a @entity135 student at @entity55 , @entity136			1
it aims to provide a possible solution for thousands of women who find the side - effects of @entity124 intolerable			1
delivering the drug locally means less has to be processed by the liver , potentially reducing side - effects such as hot flushes , cramps and nausea			1
there are now plans to run clinical trials to work out at what rate the drug would be absorbed			0
@entity152 ’s next project is to see whether similar technology could be used to deliver dementia drug galantamine via bedding or nightwear			1
vest to @entity157 @entity159 scientist dr @entity158 has invented the @entity161 vest , which he says boosts your body ’s ability to burn calories			0
the vest , which can be kept in the freezer , has pockets for ice packs around the back and shoulders			0
the idea is that by wearing the vest your body has to burn more calories to stay warm — as much as an extra 500 calories a day , says dr @entity158			0
from around £ 90 ( $ 139.99 ) from cold - @entity177 @entity178 savvy : the @entity180 june bracelet has a sensor that measures uv light @entity183 to monitor your heart @entity186 , the company working with @entity45 to create a tech sports shirt , has a top already on sale that has sensors woven into the fabric in the chest to monitor heart rate and breathing			1
the sensors can also monitor the electrical activity of the heart			0
fibres feed this information to a ‘ black box ’ — about the size of a credit card — attached to the shirt			0
the box sends the information to your mobile , with alerts from your phone telling you to breathe more , slow down or speed up			0
the heart and breathing rate data is also used to estimate how many calories you ’re burning — thought to be much more accurate than standard fitness tracking wristbands which make calculations based on how much you ’re moving			1
at the moment the garment has only been designed for men			0
a version for women is in development			0
around £ 160 from @entity223 @entity224 it ’s a wrap - dress , but not as you know it — maternity dresses designed by @entity228 , a fashion student at @entity229 in the @entity46 , contain conductive silver fibres under the bust to monitor a pregnant woman ’s heart rate , breathing , blood pressure and temperature , along with a device worn on the belt that can then communicate with a smartphone			2
the dress can then alert a mother - to - be if her readings suggest she might be over doing it — or not being active enough			2
some research has suggested that women who are more active during pregnancy have fewer complications during both gestation and labour			0
the @entity251 brooch aims to improve your posture bracelet to tell you to top up @entity255 unlike conventional wristband trackers , the @entity257 is designed to look like a piece of jewellery , with a multifaceted gem on a leather double - wrap strap			2
but the ‘ gem ’ is a sensor that measures uv light — the harmful invisible rays that cause sunburn and skin damage			0
the sensor transmits information on your sun exposure to an @entity272 and , if it detects you ’re reaching a harmful level , it will send you an alert			2
you can also tell it what factor sun cream — if any — you ’re wearing , and it will remind you to re-apply it or recommend that you use a higher factor			2
£ 79 , netatmo.com @entity280 to banish back pain the @entity251 posture coach is a sensor about the size of two 50p pieces that aims to improve your posture			0
it ’s worn just under your collar bone			0
there are decorative versions that can be pinned on your clothes like a brooch or tie pin or others that can be clipped out of sight around a bra strap or vest			2
you set the sensor when you start wearing it so it knows what your ‘ good ’ posture should be			2
to do this , you press a button on the device while you ’re standing tall , with your shoulders back and relaxed , feet hip distance apart and weight evenly distributed , bottom and stomach pulled in			2
you can then programme it to vibrate every time it detects you ’re slouching			2
maintaining good posture can be a key step in preventing back pain , according to the @entity318			0
correct posture keeps your joints aligned , helping to avoid straining your muscles			0
@entity251 , £ 79.95 from store.apple.com / uk lechal trainers have touch technology in the insole that give you directions @entity327 socks that can prevent injury @entity330 ’s smart running socks monitor the way your feet strike the ground , warning you if you are at risk of injury and also how to correct your stride			1
‘ flaws in your gait are a common cause of injury , ’ says physiotherapist @entity337			2
the @entity330 socks detect how your foot lands , and conductive fibres then relay this information to a small clip - on device on the ankle			1
this sends information to your phone , which can issue real - time audio warnings and advice if needs be			2
from around £ 130 ( $ 199 ) , sensoriafitness.com shoes that stop you getting lost @entity357 trainers have touch technology in the insole that not only counts your steps and estimates calories burnt , it also gives you directions so you can stick to a route			0
the shoes are based on ‘ haptics ’ — touch technology that gives you physical feedback from an electronic device , like a games console controller that vibrates if you crash a car in the game you ’re playing			1
once you ’ve programmed your route into a mobile phone app , the shoes vibrate on either the left or the right to tell you how to reach your destination			0
available to pre-order from around £ 100 , lechal.com and finally , the @entity378 as seen on the catwalk at @entity382 last autumn , the @entity379 , invented by @entity380 , uses haptic technology to mimic the sensation of a cuddle			0
the shirt contains sensors and tiny motors to generate warmth and pressure that feel like a hug			0
the idea , the inventors say , is to allow friends to ‘ send ’ each other hugs even when they ’re miles apart .			0
