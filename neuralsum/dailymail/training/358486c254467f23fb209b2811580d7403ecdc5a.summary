@entity0 has spoken for the first time about the ' dream ' opportunity @entity2 have offered him to follow in his father ’s footsteps			1
it is 19 years since @entity8 left @entity9 to join @entity2 , where he spent two seasons , and now the @entity12 giants are interested in signing his son , who can join up for a nominal compensation fee as his contract with @entity16 about to expire			1
the @entity17 under 21 international , who spent the second half of last season at @entity21 , has options to remain in the @entity23 but it is the prospect of moving to @entity25 that has captured the imagination and he has a serious decision to make			1
‘ the history that is there with my old man … it is dreams , it really is dreams			0
the name of @entity2 , the history , the stature of the club			1
going abroad would n’t faze me			2
‘ look at @entity49 – it shows that sometimes it is better to make these moves when you are a boy			1
i have got to make sure that wherever i am next season , i am a better player			0
there are still things that i need to learn and get better			0
but that type of interest is fantastic			0
’ the list of @entity61 exports to foreign clubs has barely been added to since @entity64 ’s high - profile loan move from @entity65 to @entity66 in 2011 and @entity0 believes the whole experience of moving to @entity25 – if that is what he decides – would have a number of positive spin - offs			1
‘ you do n’t see many @entity61 players doing it , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ whether it is the risk of the language , us @entity61 are very lazy because we only want to speak our own language and if no one else does then no one cares			0
sometimes you have to look at options like that as it opens up new horizons			0
‘ learning a different language and culture , but i have n’t ruled out staying in @entity17			2
wherever i choose , it will come down to a gut feeling			0
i have got a great man behind me to help and advise me but , when it comes down to it , it will be my decision			0
