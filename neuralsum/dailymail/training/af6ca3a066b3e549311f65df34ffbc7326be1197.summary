the real - life murder , torture and kidnapping case from @entity3 that 's behind the coming movie ' @entity5 ' indeed reads like a script - just not a funny one			1
the fact that the film , starring @entity10 and @entity11 ' @entity12 , is an action - comedy has angered survivors of the @entity17 gang 's crimes and those who investigated them nearly two decades ago			1
' you are talking about real people			2
and in this particular case , especially when you 're talking about the murder victims , these were innocent victims , ' said retired @entity24 sgt. @entity23			1
' gang members murdered and dismembered her brother and his girlfriend			1
' it 's horrible what happened to them , ' said @entity43 , who lives in @entity55			2
she could not be reached by @entity56			2
' i do n't want the @entity59 public to be sympathetic to the killers , ' she said			2
the @entity62 film , which opens april 26 and is directed by @entity63 of ' @entity64 ' and ' @entity66 ' fame , is adapted from a series of @entity69 articles about a group of 1990s bodybuilders who hatched a brutal get - rich - quick kidnapping scheme that eventually escalated to murder			1

@entity84 plays @entity85 , a fictional member of the crew			2

they finally succeed , snatching @entity87 in 1994 outside his deli			2
they kept him at @entity79 's warehouse for a month and tortured him with lighters , a @entity121 , sleep deprivation and water boarding until he had his wife and children move to @entity126 and he signed over his home , a life insurance policy and millions of dollars in investments			1

four months later , he sent @entity152 to the @entity170 police with the reams of evidence he had collected			0
@entity152 , who makes a cameo as a detective in the movie , gave the film company and director credit for making an adaption of the true story			1
' if you read the original article , the basic elements are in the movie but there is a lot of @entity187 in that movie , ' he said			0
in the movie , @entity87 is renamed ' @entity92			0
' played by @entity90 , who starred in tv 's ' @entity190 , ' adaptation : @entity87 's private investigator , @entity152 , makes a cameo in the film and gave it his approval on the facts being there , despite noting its elaborate @entity187 reenactment @entity92 is described by @entity10 's character as a criminal who deserves to have bad things happen to him			1
surrounded by women in skimpy bikinis , he 's seen in a pool while smoking a cigar			0
that image , @entity87 said , could n't be further from the truth			0
' it 's not who i am , ' said @entity87 , who now works in an accounting office			0
he says he was married and a homebody at the time of the kidnapping and never smoked cigars			0
' it 's supposed to represent me but it does n't			0
' the movie also gives some details about at least one killing that happened after @entity87 's escape , although it is unclear how that is done			0
@entity62 rejected an @entity56 request to view the film in advance			1
in reality , the gang targeted @entity230 , a @entity55 immigrant who had gotten rich running a phone sex operation - @entity78 's girlfriend knew him from the strip club where she worked			1
under the pretense of proposing a business deal , the gang invited @entity43 and his girlfriend , @entity238 , to dinner with the intent to kidnap them			1

' their response was : ` i know it 's true			0
but you ca n't even make a movie out of it because nobody will believe that it was true			0
'' watch the trailer here : @entity69 : ' one of their victims survived a month of sleep deprivation , taser jolts , lighter burns , and even the @entity294 : three days of waterboarding with sleeping pills and booze before being strapped into a blazing car			1
