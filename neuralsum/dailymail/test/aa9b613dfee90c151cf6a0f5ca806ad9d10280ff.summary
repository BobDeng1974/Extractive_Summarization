@entity0 has joined @entity1 and @entity2 in passing laws banning the promotion of extreme thinness in the fashion industry			0
the health reforms , which include fining agencies employing models with a @entity10 under 18 and criminalising pro-anorexia web content , have now passed through the upper house of parliament			1
an analysis of the reforms by @entity17 , a research psychologist at @entity18 , suggested that censoring images of ultra-thin models may ease their adverse effects on young women , such as concerns about body image and behaviours such as unhealthy eating			1
but while some have been hailing the legislation as a ' crackdown on anorexia ' , the laws may be unlikely to have any such effect			1
the view that anorexia is caused by comparing oneself to catwalk models remains popular			1
but @entity36 , of @entity37 says it is not a lifestyle choice and personality traits are to blame ( file photo ) not a lifestyle choice in @entity44 , around 0.5 per cent of adults are thought to be affected by anorexia nervosa			1
in around 10 per cent of these cases , the sufferers are men			0
these figures , however , are likely to be an underestimation			0
@entity51 has the highest mortality rate of any psychiatric illness , mostly due to organ failure and suicide			0
yet , the illness is often mistaken by many as a lifestyle choice with an external cause			0
despite accounts of the disorder pre-dating the fashion industry , the view that anorexia is caused by comparing oneself to a catwalk model remains popular			1
likewise , while pro-ana websites insist that anorexia is a commitment , not an illness , they are highly exclusive online communities , created by and for those already showing signs of the illness			1
the merely curious are not welcome			0
high levels of perfectionism , a need for organisation and a focus on details are often observed in those with anorexia , studies have shown instead , the link between media endorsement of extreme thinness and the development of anorexia is neither simple nor clear			2
research mentioned by ms @entity17 did find that women evaluated their bodies more negatively after viewing images of thin models			1
however , this effect was small and mostly determined by women 's pre-existing opinions of their figures – women who were already dissatisfied with their body were most affected			1
as this effect was only measured at one point in time , the effects of prolonged exposure are not known , but when more images were used there was a tendency for the effect to be smaller			1
perhaps , as the authors suggested , these images activated , rather than cultivated , beauty ideals			2
whether the effects of media exposure on body dissatisfaction leads to changes in eating behaviour is also unclear			0
another study , also cited by @entity115 , looked for a link between a person 's real - life media exposure and eating disorder symptoms			2
the results were fairly inconsistent , with some factors – such as body dissatisfaction – only corresponding to some types of media , and others – such as self - worth – showing no relationship			1
more importantly , the research showed correlation , not causation – it is just as plausible that women already unhappy with their bodies seek out thinness - promoting media more often			1
after all , if such a simple causal relationship did exist , the pervasiveness of these images in our culture raises the question of why the majority of our population is overweight , rather than underweight			2
in @entity44 , around 0.5 per cent of adults are thought to be affected by anorexia nervosa , but these figures tend to be underestimated , experts said ( file photo ) model ban but no support most researchers currently view the cultural value placed on thinness as a ' background risk factor '			1
meanwhile , several psychological and biological factors are implicated			2
high levels of perfectionism , a need for organisation and a focus on details are often observed in those with anorexia			2
recent research suggests there is a lower reward response to food in the brain , even after recovery			0
some of these factors seem to be influenced by genetic inheritance			2
stressful experiences may then influence whether these existing factors then lead to developing the disorder			2
more than one risk factor will be necessary			2
so the legislation is likely to have little effect on the prevalence of anorexia in the general population , but it also offers no support to the models themselves			1
the law requires a medical certificate proving that a model has a @entity10 of at least 18			0
this is still underweight , according to the @entity186			0
regular weigh - ins have been only vaguely suggested and there 's been no mention of an obligation to offer support to a model who fails a weigh - in			0
while there is some debate over whether models are at a higher risk of developing eating disorders , this career certainly encourages unhealthy behaviour			1
thinness of this degree has hugely damaging effects on the internal organs , bones and brain			0
it can cause obsessiveness and social withdrawal even in psychologically healthy people			0
@entity0 has already lost a high - profile model to anorexia – yet the new laws almost encourage agencies to wash their hands of models who fall ill. legislation banning models with a @entity10 under 18 is likely to have little effect on the prevalence of anorexia in the general population , but it also offers no support to the models themselves , experts have argued in the same way , while pro-ana content is undoubtedly harmful , the new laws punish those who are in need of help			1
this exclusively punitive approach is likely to drive these sites further undergound			0
if the measures are enforced – if spot checks continue , weigh - ins are n't cheated and other countries are supportive – they may be a positive move			0
they may be a first step towards a culture that prioritises health over aesthetics – whether that means a dangerously small or unhealthily large body			0
nonetheless , this will mostly benefit the worried well – those who , regrettably , are unhappy with their bodies , but are otherwise unlikely to develop anorexia nervosa			0
claiming that these laws address one of the most treatment - resistant mental illnesses is far too optimistic			0
this article was co-written by @entity258 , an msc in @entity260 at @entity37			1

@entity36 is a *teaching* fellow at @entity37 - and works with students looking at *cognitive* traits associated with anorexia risk
argues that rather than skinny models being to blame , other factors are
states that people with anorexia tend to have a certain personality type
and that images of thin women are unlikely to have much of an effect
