by @entity0 and @entity1 and @entity2 and @entity3 after one @entity8 , four @entity5 , a @entity6 and the @entity7 , @entity4 looks to have played his last game for @entity10			1
the left - back has tweeted he 's weighing up his options for next season and he does n't believe the @entity14 will be one of them			1
but where will he end up ? many would argue the 33 - year - old would improve the first teams of @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24			1
so , we decided to ask the fan websites of those teams - even former club @entity23 - whether they would like to sign the recently - retired @entity29 international			1
@entity22 @entity1 : @entity31 if you were to ask any @entity22 fan whether they 'd take @entity4 , even on a free transfer , the resounding answer would be ' no ! ' there 's something eminently unlikeable about @entity4			2
but given some time , you can see the sense in it : he 's vastly experienced , won it all ( many times ) and his game does n't rely on speed or pace so , at 33 , you 'd get two or three more years out of him			0
and , given his recent retirement from @entity29 duty , he 'd be fully focused on the job			0
we may not like it , but he 'd be a quality acquisition and save us a fortune			0
follow @entity31 on @entity53 at @ live4liverpool on his way ? @entity10 's @entity4 has tweeted that he expects to leave @entity56 this summer @entity21 @entity57 : @entity58 the transformation of full - backs in the last 10 - 15 years has seen their job description change from not only being able to defend well , but to get forward effectively too			1
@entity4 was one of the pioneers of attacking full - back play , but after eight successful years at @entity10 , he is now in search of a new club			1
it will most likely be his last			0
the 33 - year - old is a fine example of a modern day full - back , but his best days are long gone			2
which is why @entity21 are looking increasingly likely to sign @entity71 , who is without doubt the most promising full - back @entity29 has seen since @entity4 broke onto the scene at @entity23			1
there are also ongoing discussions to keep @entity77 at the club for another year			0
the former @entity80 captain is a better role model , on and off the pitch , for @entity71 to learn under			0
follow @entity58 on @entity53 @ @entity82 trophies : @entity4 won the @entity8 , four @entity5 , one @entity6 and @entity7 at @entity10 @entity24 @entity3 : view from a @entity85 in the final stages of last season , @entity4 demonstrated that he still retains the competitive edge and defensive instinct to compete at a decent level			1
but the reality is that if he were n’t @entity93 , there would be no rumours linking him with @entity24			2
however , such is our need to adhere to the quotas , there has been the odd mention about his possible arrival			0
will it happen ? i very much doubt it			0
would i like it to happen ? again , probably not			0
he has his uses and i ’m sure he ’ll be a good short - term signing for someone , but he ’s no better going forward than @entity109 , whose place in the squad he would likely take			0
left - back is not @entity24 ’s strongest position , but i ’m far from convinced a 33 - year - old @entity4 is the answer			1
follow view from a @entity85 on @entity53 @ viewfromablue veteran : @entity4 retired from international football earlier this month after winning 107 caps for @entity29 @entity23 @entity2 : @entity120 @entity4 back to @entity23 ? on the face of it , it ’s a no. the man is an odious blight on the memory of most @entity23 fans			1
but then i think about why he might be leaving @entity10			2
@entity129 , out of the @entity8 game for six years has come back and he ’s proved he is now the ' specialist in failure '			2
@entity4 wants to win trophies on the back nine of his career			2
@entity129 has n’t won anything for two years , he ’s upsetting players , selling his best names , looking and sounding like a bit of a nutter , choking with an incredible squad … @entity4 probably wants to move @entity142 ’s most trophy - laden club this season			1
i ’d take him back as a reserve , providing he promised not to crash his @entity145 when he sees the pay - as - you - play contract i ’d have on offer			0
follow @entity120 on @entity53 @ @entity149			0

the left - back has won one @entity8 , four @entity5 , one @entity6 and the @entity7 at @entity10
@entity22 , @entity24 , @entity21 , @entity23 and @entity154 could make a move for the defender
