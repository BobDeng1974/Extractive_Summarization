each year we spend £ 2.5 billion on over-the - counter medicines from chemists , corner shops and supermarkets , a figure that has been growing by nearly 10 per cent annually			1
yet emerging evidence suggests many of these pills and lotions are utterly useless — and some can actually make our health worse			1
@entity10 , a clinical pharmacy lecturer at @entity12 , claims that by selling such products , @entity14 chemists are ‘ endorsing quackery ’ in the pursuit of profits			1
‘ @entity21 pharmacists should stop selling over-the - counter medicines that have little evidence of efficacy , ’ he wrote in @entity19 in august			1
here , we identify several of the items you do n’t need in your bathroom cabinet			0
cough medicine what we spend a year : £ 96 million what does everyone do when they get a cough ? they go out and buy some cough medicine , of course			1
yet there is little , if any proof , that it will help you recover			0
dr @entity50 , vice-chairman of the @entity51 , says : ‘ the medical evidence behind cough medicines is weak , and there ’s no evidence they ’ll reduce the duration of illnesses			1
’ if your cough is caused by a viral infection , as coughs most commonly are , there is no quick way of getting rid of it — you simply have to wait for the immune system to clear the virus			2
cough medicines wo n’t speed up this process , no matter what ‘ wonder ’ ingredients are proclaimed on the package			1
the @entity72 website suggests cough sufferers make their own remedy of honey and lemon a review of 17 studies involving 2,876 adults and eight studies involving 616 children by the influential @entity82 in 2008 found no robust evidence that dextromethorphan or diphenhydramine — two common ingredients in over-the - counter cough medicines — helped			1
@entity10 warns some costly cough medicines may even be harmful			1
‘ the drug combinations they contain can be illogical — such as an expectorant , which produces mucus , with a cough suppressant , which quashes the urge to eject mucus , ’ he says			2
‘ these are often more likely to bring about an adverse effect , such as drowsiness and nausea , or no effect			0
’ a spokesman for the @entity102 of @entity103 , which represents makers of over-the - counter drugs , says : ‘ cough medicines will not “ cure ” a cough , but they can help relieve the symptoms			1
’ the @entity72 website suggests cough sufferers make their own remedy of honey and lemon			1
‘ the honey is a demulcent , which means it coats the throat and relieves the irritation that causes coughing , ’ it says			0
the lemon is there only to add sharpness to the flavour			0
@entity123 - @entity122 what we spend a year : £ 7.8 million a bottle of eardrops from the chemist may contain impressive - sounding ingredients such as glycerol and urea hydrogen peroxide to help loosen or dissolve wax			1
there is , however , no good clinical evidence to show these work any better than simply putting water in your ear to soften wax , according to a study by the @entity141			2
its study in 2009 , led by @entity144 , an otolaryngologist ( ear , nose and throat specialist ) at the @entity148 , concluded : ‘ @entity149 or water seems to be as effective as any over-the - counter agent			1
and both have the virtue of being cheap and readily available			0
’ @entity154 what we spend a year : £ 42.5 million many over-the - counter sleep - aid pills contain the antihistamine diphenhydramine			1
this is commonly used to quell allergic reactions and has the side - effect of drowsiness			2
however , there is no scientific evidence to support its usefulness for treating insomnia			1
indeed , the @entity72 website warns : ‘ good evidence of diphenhydramine ’s efficacy is lacking			2
’ many over-the - counter sleep - aid pills contain the antihistamine diphenhydramine			1
this is commonly used to quell allergic reactions and has the side - effect of drowsiness there are only two robust clinical studies that have tested its effectiveness in treating insomnia			2
the first , published in the journal @entity180 in 2005 , compared a sleep - aid dose of diphenhydramine with a placebo pill in 20 elderly insomniacs			2
the participants reported no difference in how long they took to drop off to sleep , how well they slept or for how long			0
the second study , in the same journal report , examined 184 adults with mild insomnia			2
automated readings of their brain , eye and muscle activity found that taking diphenhydramine had no more effect than placebo pills			2
@entity201 ’s other side - effects can include dry mouth , dizziness , headaches , constipation and urinary retention			2
pain - relief rubs with aspirin what we spend a year : £ 20 million the active ingredient in aspirin , salicylate , is proven to reduce pain and inflammation when swallowed			1
but that does not mean it is effective in a skin rub for muscle aches			0
the idea is that by putting the painkiller next to the strained muscle , it soothes the area faster and more effectively			0
however , a comprehensive review of research by the @entity226 in 2009 found little evidence that over-the - counter pain - relieving creams containing salicylate have any effect on muscle aches and pains when compared with a sham placebo cream			1
dr @entity235 , an @entity236 biochemist who led the review , concluded that such creams are a waste of money			0
those containing non-steroidal anti-inflammatory painkiller gels , such as ibuprofen or diclofenac , work considerably better , he said			0
@entity246 - bite @entity245 what we spend a year : £ 14 million there are dozens of over-the - counter creams and pills to relieve itching and swelling caused by insect bites — but there is little evidence they do much to help			1
there is no solid evidence the £ 14 million we spend each year on insect bite creams and pills to relieve itching and swelling			1
do much to help creams that contain painkillers or anaesthetics , or those with antihistamines and antiseptics , are only ‘ marginally effective ’ , according to a review by the @entity267 in 2012			0
it warned that these chemical - laden creams can make skin even more sensitive			2
other options include steroid tablets and ointments , such as hydrocortisone			0
but once again there is no solid evidence to suggest they work , unless the people using them suffer from reactive skin conditions such as eczema , the journal reported			0
a simple antiseptic cream can have a soothing ‘ kiss - it - better ’ effect for a child with an insect bite , as well as being an infection - fighting precaution			1
@entity291 soaps and wipes what we spend a year : £ 239 million although it seems common sense that antibacterial soap can protect ourselves and our families from illness caused by bacteria , this is not what the evidence shows			2
more than four decades of research by the @entity308 government ’s @entity306 , along with numerous independent studies , have produced no evidence that triclosan , the active ingredient in many antibacterial soaps , hand gels and wipes , has any health benefits over old - fashioned soap and water			1
one basic problem is that antibacterial soaps specifically target bacteria rather than viruses			0
but it is viruses that cause the majority of illnesses , such as colds and flu			0
the most effective scientifically proven way to keep bacteria at bay is regular hand - washing with ordinary soap , along with good food hygiene in the kitchen			0
antibacterial soaps may actually cause health problems , too			0
evidence shows children with prolonged exposure to triclosan over months or years have a greater chance of developing allergies , including peanut allergies and hay fever , according to studies in the @entity345 in 2012 , and in @entity346 in 2011			2
this may be due to the fact that youngsters who use antibacterial soaps and cleansers reduce their exposure to bacteria			0
but the bugs may be essential for training their developing immune systems to respond appropriately to potential infections and allergens			0
@entity358 what we spend a year : £ 60 million more than 40 per cent of us use whitening toothpastes — even though they often cost three times more than standard toothpaste			1
more than 40 per cent of us use whitening toothpastes , at a cost of £ 60 million a year , but investigators at the @entity368 said there is a complete lack of clinical studies to back up makers ' claims the pastes purport to work by bleaching or being abrasive			1
however , investigators at the @entity368 complained last february there is a complete lack of clinical studies to back up makers ’ claims			0
some of these products proclaim that they use hydrogen peroxide as a bleaching agent to whiten out stains			0
but dr @entity384 , chief executive of the @entity385 , says : ‘ toothpastes sold in the @entity387 can legally contain only 0.1 per cent hydrogen peroxide , in order to be safe			0
‘ the chance of that amount having an effect on teeth is virtually non-existent			0
you need at least 30 times that to achieve anything			0

£ 2.5 billion is spent on over-the - counter medicines including cough medicines , whitening toothpastes , insect bite relief and insomnia remedies
but emerging evidence suggests a vast number of these pills and potions are useless - with some actually making our health worse
