by @entity0 published : 17:02 est , 10 october 2013 updated : 17:17 est , 10 october 2013 there were growing demands last night for an inquiry into whether the @entity4 could be prosecuted for publishing top - secret files			1
the calls came as the row over the leaking of intelligence intensified with @entity10 and @entity11 joining the prime minister ’s attack on the newspaper			1
it has now been condemned by @entity16 , his deputy and the home secretary for revelations described as a ‘ gift ’ to terrorists by @entity23 chief @entity22			1
mr @entity16 has thrown his full weight behind mr @entity22 ’s warning on tuesday that printing documents stolen by fugitive @entity28 agent @entity27 was handing fanatics the advantage they need to ‘ strike at will ’			2
there have been calls for prosecutions in the wake of @entity4 's leaking of espionage secrets			1
pictured is @entity39 , the newspaper 's editor in the @entity43 , @entity42 mp @entity41 demanded to know if the @entity4 had broken the law by transporting sensitive personal information about @entity47 agents across the world			1
the material was allegedly included in 58,000 secret documents being carried by @entity51 , the partner of @entity4 journalist @entity52			1
the newspaper was paying for his flights when he was detained at @entity56 in august			1
despite the wave of anger at the newspaper , however , the main @entity58 news bulletins were still largely ignoring the furore , leading to accusations of ‘ left - wing bias ’ by @entity65			1
mr @entity41 told fellow @entity65 : ‘ @entity4 has not denied sending detailed family and personal information about security agents across borders			1
this is illegal , it ’s threatening our agents and their families			2
‘ can we have a statement from the home secretary to clarify that the law will be upheld whether or not the organisation involved is hiding behind the fig leaf of journalism ? ’ @entity79 , leader of the @entity80 , said he would ask mrs may to consider the comments			2
leading counter-terrorism expert professor @entity83 also declared that the @entity4 should be prosecuted			1
the head of the @entity85 at the @entity86 said that mr @entity22 clearly believed the @entity47 ’s security had been damaged			2
‘ if that is the case , a prosecution under the @entity89 should follow , ’ added prof @entity83			2
‘ it is not clear to me why that has not happened and i suspect it is not clear to the director - general [ mr @entity22 ] either			2
’ meanwhile , the @entity95 , which includes former top military chiefs , warned that the leaks have put the lives of soldiers at risk			0
they fear that revealing intelligence techniques could help extremists targeting @entity47 troops overseas to avoid detection			0
general sir @entity105 , former chief of the general staff , said he agreed with everything mr @entity22 had said about the leaks			0
‘ we are getting into very dangerous territory here , ’ he added			0
association director @entity110 added the newspaper had ‘ crossed the line ’ between legitimate journalism and harming national security			2
‘ there is a widespread concern in the military community , ’ he said			0
‘ intelligence is being publicised that could give advantage to our enemies			0
’ mr @entity16 continued his attack by directly questioning if the @entity4 ‘ understood ’ what it was doing			1
he said : ‘ when you get newspapers who get hold of vast amounts of information and data , which is effectively stolen , then they have to think about their responsibilities			0
they have to think about are they helping to keep our country safe ? ‘ they need to show understanding about the issue and it does go to our ability to fight terrorism			0
’ his deputy entered the row on his regular radio show on @entity147			0
mr @entity10 warned the @entity4 was revealing technical information of ‘ immense interest ’ to terrorists by publishing data on @entity153 ’s eavesdropping techniques stolen by @entity27			1
‘ secrecy is necessary , of course it is , ’ he added			0
‘ you must absolutely defend the principle of secrecy for the intelligence agencies , without which they ca n’t keep us safe			0
’ mrs may said she agreed with mr @entity22 that the leaks were causing huge damage to national security			0
‘ it is difficult when you have revelations about how security operates , ’ she warned			0
‘ then that does cause a problem it can give some comfort to terrorists			0
’ yesterday , the @entity174 reported how @entity47 deputy head of national security , @entity175 , had told a court ‘ real damage has already been done ’			0
but @entity4 editor @entity39 insists the paper , which revealed details of mass surveillance programmes by the @entity28 and @entity47 , has been careful not to publish any material harmful to @entity47 ’s interests			1
@entity22 , the director - general of @entity23 , blasted @entity4 's expose			1

many high - profile figures have condemned @entity4 's *spy* leak *coverage*
mp @entity41 *branded* the newspaper 's actions ' illegal '
