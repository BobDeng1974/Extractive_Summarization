@entity0 are set to win their first commons seat with a landslide 64 per cent of the vote following the biggest swing in modern political history			1
turncoat mp @entity7 is set to humiliate @entity8 at the @entity9 by - election sparked by his defection , a @entity13 poll for @entity14 has revealed			1
the figures – the first test of public opinion since the politician rocked @entity19 by defecting to @entity21 ’s party – predict a record 48 point swing towards @entity0			1
but it would still leave @entity24 with a yawning 33 point deficit and they put the @entity32 party a staggering 44 percentage points ahead of mr @entity7 ’s former party in the @entity36 constituency			2
if the results are repeated in the by - election , expected in october , the swing would exceed the current record 44 points achieved by @entity42 mp @entity41 when he thrashed @entity44 ’s @entity43 , the gay rights campaigner , in a by - election in @entity46 , @entity25 , in 1983			1
the biggest anti-tory swing to date is the 35 points achieved by the @entity42 in the @entity49 by - election in 1993			2
the 48 point @entity0 swing in @entity9 is partly the result of the party not having stood in the 2010 election , so their support has gone from nought to 64 per cent in one leap			1
the poll blow came as senior @entity58 mp sir @entity57 fiercely criticised mr @entity7			2
former defence minister sir @entity57 told @entity14 : ‘ what @entity7 has done is sheer madness			0
staggering : the figures - the first test of public opinion since the politician rocked @entity19 by defecting to @entity21 's party - predict a record 48 point swing towards @entity0 ‘ it is rank disloyalty to a party that gave him a place in @entity73			1
‘ @entity7 is a very unusual mp and it has been clear for some time where his true political sympathies lie			0
’ @entity58 chiefs plan to flood the seaside constituency with ministers and @entity80 in an attempt to hold back @entity7 ’s tidal wave of support			1
but the poll suggests it may be impossible			0
mr @entity7 ’s lead means the @entity58 will need a miracle to retain the seat and stop him becoming @entity0 ’s first mp			1
even charismatic @entity24 would have little chance of defeating strait - laced mr @entity7			0
according to the @entity13 poll , the @entity25 mayor would win 27 per cent against mr @entity7 ’s 60 , cutting @entity0 ’s lead by 11			1
but it would still leave @entity24 with a yawning 33 point deficit			0
heading for victory : @entity7 with @entity0 leader @entity21			0
turncoat mp @entity7 is set to humiliate @entity8 at the @entity9 by - election sparked by his defection mr @entity7 ’s astonishing 64 per cent appears to be a reflection of a combination of enormous local personal support for him – and for @entity0			1
of those who intend to vote @entity0 , two - thirds said that they would do so because they liked the party , and one in three because they like mr @entity7			2
fewer than one in ten said it was to protest against the government			0
fewer than one in five @entity58 supporters in @entity9 believe he has ‘ betrayed ’ the party – half hail him as a hero			1
mr @entity21 is close to being the most popular party leader in @entity9 , polling 25 from all voters , one point behind mr @entity8 on 26			2
mr @entity8 's attempt to strike back at @entity21 by arguing that a vote for @entity0 will make it easier for @entity117 to become prime minister is having no effect on @entity0 's support nor is mr @entity8 ’s attempt to strike back at @entity21 by arguing that a vote for @entity0 will make it easier for @entity117 to become prime minister having any effect on @entity0 ’s support			1
nearly seven in ten said such warnings had no impact ; 15 per cent said they were less likely to vote @entity0 with 16 per cent more @entity129 ’s reasons for defecting to @entity0 also win strong approval : half or more agreed with the statements that mr @entity8 is ‘ too keen ’ on staying in the @entity133 ; refuses to ‘ shake up the @entity19 clique ’ ; has lost control of the @entity136 ’s borders ; should cut both spending and tax ; and should bring in new laws to make it easier for voters to sack mps in between general elections			1
likewise , the residents of @entity9 , which is opposite the @entity147 coast , heartily agree with mr @entity7 ’s determination to cut the @entity136 ’s ties with @entity150			1
a total of 54 per cent say the @entity136 should go it alone , more than twice the number who want to stay in the @entity133			2
immigration is by far the biggest issue in @entity9			0
nearly half say it is their main concern , followed by @entity161 on 13 per cent , cost of living six , jobs five and health three			0
while the @entity58 are by far the biggest loser in @entity9 , the survey also makes grim reading for mr @entity117 and @entity168			0
labour support has halved to a mere 13 per cent since the @entity170 and the @entity42 are almost off the graph at a paltry two per cent , compared to 11 per cent in 2010			0
mr @entity117 ’s personal rating is eight per cent , with mr @entity168 on just three			0
a @entity58 official said last night : ‘ mr @entity7 has had the benefit of huge publicity over the last few days			2
we were taken by complete surprise by his defection			0
‘ once we have chosen a candidate and started to canvass in @entity9 and can show that voting @entity58 is the only way to get a referendum in the @entity133 , we are confident we will do very well in the by - election			1
’ @entity13 polled 700 people online on thursday and friday			0
this really is a political earthquake , writes @entity186 , chief executive of poll firm @entity13 mr @entity7 , pictured , has been accused of betraying his party , but that is not how the vast majority of his constituents see him political earthquake is an expression often used without justification , but not in the case of our @entity9 poll result			0
it shows that the by - election triggered by sitting conservative mp @entity7 ’s defection to @entity0 could go down in @entity136 political history as one of the most dramatic of all time			1
based on the poll , the 12,000 majority mr @entity7 won as a @entity207 in @entity9 in 2010 would turn into an even bigger one for @entity0 of more than 15,000 on a similar turnout			2
it has alarming implications for @entity8 and the @entity207			0
mr @entity7 has been accused of betraying his party , but that is not how the vast majority of his constituents see him			0
today ’s survey lays to rest the notion that mr @entity7 defected for cynical reasons after becoming convinced that if he did n’t , he would lose to @entity0			2
such is his personal popularity that he would almost certainly have won the seat had he fought it with a blue rosette next may , rather than now in the yellow and purple colours of @entity0			0
most worrying of all for the prime minister is the reaction of other potential @entity58 mp defectors to the likely outcome of the by - election			1
if mr @entity7 lost or won narrowly , other like - minded conservatives toying with going over to @entity0 would probably conclude it was far too risky			2
but if he wins with a record - breaking swing , as our poll suggests he could , they may decide it is more risky to fight the next election as a @entity58 candidate than as a @entity0 one			1
and that could change the landscape of @entity136 politics .			0

@entity7 is set to win @entity9 by - election sparked by his defection
figures predict a record 48 point swing towards @entity0 , humiliating the @entity58
@entity8 ’s drive to reform the @entity133 ahead of a *mooted* in - out referendum was given a major boost by the new *president* of the @entity253 last night . @entity254 , who will give up his job as @entity257 prime minister , said he ‘ could not *imagine* ’ the @entity133 without @entity136 as a *member* – *insisting* it would be possible to ‘ reach an agreement ’ on issues such as *freedom* of movement of labour .
