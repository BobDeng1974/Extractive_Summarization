should @entity3 ban @entity1 after latest bite storm ? is there any way back ? at what point is enough is enough and football begins to turn its back on @entity1 ? as news began to sink about this latest , remarkable controversy to engulf @entity1 , the calls for him to be banished from the game for an indefinite period were long and loud			1
three strikes and you are out , so the theory goes			0
‘ i do not want to see one of the best players in the world banned from this tournament but you can not have that example , ’ former @entity19 manager @entity18 said on @entity20			0
‘ you do that in a street somewhere and you are going to prison			0
a statement on @entity3 's website said : ' @entity3 can confirm that disciplinary proceedings have been opened against the player @entity1 of @entity38 following an apparent breach of art. 48 and / or art. 57 of the @entity54 during the @entity57 @entity56 match @entity34 - @entity38 played on 24 june 2014			1
' the player and / or the @entity60 @entity59 are invited to provide with their position and any documentary evidence they deem relevant until 25 june 2014 , 5pm , @entity65 time			0
' according to art. 77 lit. a of the @entity54 ( @entity67 ) , the @entity66 is responsible for sanctioning serious infringements which have escaped the match officials ' attention			2
' furthermore , according to art. 96 of the @entity67 , any type of proof may be produced ( par. 1 ) , in particular are admissible , reports from referees , declarations from the parties and witnesses , material evidence , audio or video recordings ( par. 3 )			2
' click here for the full story there is no defending @entity1			1
biting @entity86 ’s @entity85 in november 2010 could have been considered an aberration but to repeating the transgression on @entity89 of @entity90 ( april 2013 ) and now @entity34 ’s @entity33 highlights an underlying behavioural problem			1
@entity1 , for some reason , does n’t learn but what he may now discover in the wake of this absurd moment in @entity96 is that the trust managers and team - mates have for him begins to slowly dwindle away			1
how can you rely on someone that has the ability to let you down ? from now on , that question will lurk in the back of everyone ’s mind			0
he might be a genius , one of the most spell - binding players in the world when at the peak of his powers , but that habit of going wildly off the rails is going to be his legacy			2
what happens with him now will make for intriguing viewing			0
a move to @entity120 has been mooted and the signs that have been coming from @entity122 in the last few days was that a bid to prise him away from @entity125 was looming			0
but will this controversy force @entity120 to abort ? they pride themselves on the motto ‘ mes que une club ’ ( more than a club ) but will they go him for him now ? given the turmoil they have experienced in the past year over the deal to sign @entity139 , do they need to bring more trouble to their door ? previous : @entity1 received a seven game ban for biting @entity86 's @entity144 while playing for @entity145 , 2010 ouch ! @entity144 shows the bite marks to a @entity86 teammate after the incident controversy : @entity1 is captured biting @entity90 defender @entity89 in april 2013 bite night ! defender explains what happened to the referee before @entity1 received a 10 - game ban there will , inevitably , be ramifications for @entity156 too			1
should he stay on @entity158 , he will be the subject of intense scrutiny , critics will be waiting for him to step out of line and ask how they can continue to offer support when he has besmirched their reputation			0
yet ask @entity164 or any of his team - mates and they will all tell you the same thing about him around the training ground : he is quite and humble , never any trouble			2
he comes in , relishes his work then goes home to dote on his family			0
they do n’t see the monster that others do			0
red leader : @entity156 manager @entity164 ( r ) has always supported @entity1 family guy : off the pitch , @entity1 is renowned for being a doting father they see a world class player and that is why , regardless of the shock and horror of this bite on @entity33 , he wo n’t fail to have a career at the highest level			1
‘ i ’m staggered but it wo n’t affect him , ’ said former @entity19 captain @entity188 on @entity189			1
‘ there will always be someone who is prepared to take a gamble on him			1
’ yet there will always be that anxiety with @entity1 that a moment of madness is never far away .			2
