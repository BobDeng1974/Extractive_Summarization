by @entity0 a mother today revealed her shock at how her ' micro ' pig - who weighed just 7lbs when she bought him four years ago - has grown at such a rapid rate that he is now a whopping 21 - stone beast			1
@entity7 , 46 , of @entity8 , bought @entity9 when he was tiny - but he kept on growing , to tip the scales at more than 300lbs and only just fitting in her small garden			1
now , @entity12 has declared that @entity9 is officially classed as a farmyard animal - and after receiving complaints from neighbours , officials have told miss @entity7 that @entity9 has to go			1
whopping size : @entity7 , of @entity8 , watched @entity9 grow over four years to weigh more than 300lbs early days : when ms @entity7 bought @entity9 he only weighed 7lbs - and was sold to her as a ' micro-deluxe ' pig under threat : the 46 - year - old woman has been told by @entity12 that @entity9 the pig has to go she said : ‘ when i bought him he only weighed 7lbs and was sold to me as a micro-deluxe			1
he was smaller than my @entity24			0
it 's clear now that 's not the case but i still love him			1
‘ in fact , the bigger the pig , the more there is to love			0
i 'll never give him up			0
i do n't look at him like an animal - he 's a part of the family			1
i treat him like he 's one of my children			2
’ miss @entity7 is looking for a new council home for her and her son , 20 , and his brother , 21 , but she can not go on the waiting list for most authorities as she does not already live in the area			1
another stumbling block is that many private landlords are concerned that her other pets - three dogs , two ferrets and two tortoises - might be a threat to any animals on nearby farmland			0
but miss @entity7 has vowed to never give up @entity9 and refuses to leave him behind			1
the pampered pig even has toys and loves his children 's music box which plays a song that he goes to sleep to			2
animals at play : @entity9 , pictured as a baby with @entity59 the dog , is now ' part of the family ' , his owner insisted having a rest : @entity9 with ms @entity7 's son @entity64 , 20			1
the pig now only just fits in her small garden she added : ‘ looking for a new place to live for all of us is a nightmare			1
i 've applied to every single council in @entity71 and had no luck so now i 'm searching further afield			0
‘ i 'm hoping i might have a better chance somewhere rural places in the middle of nowhere that will let me keep my animals			0
i 'm an animal lover and i 've got to keep us all together			2
' the bigger the pig , the more there is to love			0
i 'll never give him up			0
i do n't look at him like an animal - he 's a part of the family ' @entity7 ‘ there 's not an animal on this planet that i do n't like but i 've loved pigs since i was a small child			1

if the music finishes before he 's asleep , he pushes the buttons again			2
’ a council spokesman said : ‘ we visited this tenant after a complaint about animals at the property and advised her that keeping farm animals is a breach of her tenancy agreement			0
we will revisit next week to assess the situation			0
' our focus is on encouraging this tenant to find a suitable home for the pig and we have not yet started eviction proceedings			0
we are trying to rehome the pig			0
