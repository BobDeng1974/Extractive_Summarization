the microscope at the @entity1 , set at 10 - times magnification , shows a marijuana leaf covered with dozens of tiny bumps of mold , and someone the tiny bumps are n’t easily detectable with the naked eye , so someone somewhere could be smoking similarly contaminated pot and not have a clue			1
@entity12 , a forensic botanist and associate professor at the university , says all sorts of nasty things not visible to the naked eye have been found in marijuana - mold , mildew , insect parts , salmonella and @entity22 , to name a few			1
@entity24 marijuana : a @entity26 magnification of a pot leaf shows tiny bumps of mold all over the specimen and researchers the @entity1 say contaminants like this as well as insecticides , insects , and others are becoming increasingly common invisible menace : while the marijuana tested at the @entity1 may appear normal to the naked eye , the contaminants become visible when magnified that 's why @entity42 and her students earlier this year began developing a new process to detect contaminants in marijuana through dna profiling and analysis			1
the aim is to be able to identify potentially harmful substances through a testing method that could make the analysis easier and quicker for labs across the country in the developing industry of marijuana quality control testing			0
twenty states and @entity59 , now allow medical marijuana with a doctor 's recommendation , and @entity63 and @entity64 have legalized the recreational pot use			1
@entity66 and @entity63 already require testing and other states are doing the same , spawning a testing industry			2
‘ if there 's no certification ... it 's like saying we do n't check our meat for mad cow disease , ’ @entity42 said			1
‘ that 's our goal as a private university , to develop the tools to address or mediate this issue			2
’ a number of labs around the country are testing marijuana for contaminants using different methods , many of which have been around for decades and used to test other plants , including food crops , for harmful substances			2
the health effects of marijuana tainted with mold , pesticides and other contaminants are n't clear , said @entity96 , a @entity64 - based spokesman for the @entity97 in @entity59 the project was founded in 1995 to lobby for the reduction or elimination of penalties for marijuana use			2
‘ although we have not seen significant problems with tainted marijuana in the past , we should certainly be taking steps to make sure it 's not a problem in the future , ’ @entity96 said			1
‘ we have never seen a death solely associated with marijuana use			0
the same certainly ca n't be said of alcohol and other drugs			0
’ ¿ significant toxicological threat ¿ : another group in @entity115 this year found that pesticides found on marijuana could pass to the smoke , and then the smoker , when burned and inhaled ' @entity121 this issue ' : @entity12 , an associate professor at the @entity1 , shows a dna she hopes will help her develop a new method to detect contaminants on marijuana using dna profiling and analysis @entity129 records from 1997 - 2005 show no cases in which marijuana was the primary suspected cause of death , but the drug was listed as a secondary suspected cause contributing to 279 deaths			1
the @entity138 said in july that an ‘ epidemic ’ of synthetic drug use has caused rising numbers of deaths and emergency room visits			0
one study released earlier this year , however , found that pesticide residues on cannabis are transferred to inhaled marijuana smoke , possibly posing a ‘ significant toxicological threat			1
’ the study was done by @entity150 , an independent testing lab for medical cannabis in @entity153 , @entity115 , and published in the peer - reviewed journal of toxicology			1
new problems , new solutions : twenty states and the @entity59 now allow medical marijuana and @entity59 and @entity66 are blazing the trail toward a certification process patients can lean on for assurance their marijuana is safe @entity97 can develop mold from an inadequate drying process or poor storage conditions after harvesting			1
it can also become tainted with @entity22 and other dangerous substances by being near farm animals			0
@entity42 will be developing a new method for creating dna profiles of biological contaminants found in marijuana including mold , viruses , fungi and bacteria			2
the profiles could then be compared with dna profiles of organisms kept in a database maintained by the @entity181 - a division of the @entity182			0
‘ what we 're trying to do is put the information together in a user - friendly format , ’ @entity42 said			0
‘ having some better technology in place is a good thing			0
’ the university 's work also will include identifying whether cannabis material is real marijuana or a synthetic version comprising non-marijuana herbs sprayed with @entity196 , the compound that gets users high			2
@entity42 is aiming to complete the new process by next summer			0
what happens after that has n't been determined			0
the school could patent the process and sell it for a fee to whoever wanted to use it , or could allow its use for free , she said			0
the school also could establish its own commercial testing lab. the @entity1 's work is an extension of the law enforcement - related marijuana dna profiling the school has done over the past five years under a $ 100,000 grant from the federal @entity219 's @entity218 program			1
the school created a marijuana dna profile database that has helped federal authorities determine where illegal pot growers and dealers got their product .			0

@entity1 researchers in @entity66 , where medical marijuana is legal , say they *'ve* found samples covered in mildew , salmonella , and insecticide
' it 's like saying we do n't check our meat for mad cow disease ' : researchers are creating ways to root out tainted marijuana
‘ significant toxicological threat ’ : a @entity115 company this year discovered dangerous pesticide residues that transferred into the smoke
