by @entity0 @entity1 , pictured , ' instinctively ' instinctively ¿ hit a mugger in the face when he realised he was trying to steal his bag as a tv presenter of survival programmes he is used to fending for himself in extreme conditions			1
@entity1 found himself having to deploy his skills in the more urban setting of a @entity11 street after a man attempted to snatch his bag			1
thankfully it was @entity1 who was left unharmed but his attacker was visibly injured after the presenter ‘ instinctively ’ hit him in the face when he realised what was happening			1
and taking to social networking site @entity19 minutes later , @entity1 admitted punching the man in the face , telling his followers : ‘ dear mr @entity23			1
you picked on the wrong man			1
’ the drama unfolded yesterday afternoon ( @entity28 ) , as @entity1 walked along a central @entity11 street , not far from where he lives with his wife @entity31 , and their children @entity34 , 4 , and @entity35 , 2			1
he was on his way to a meeting with his pa near @entity39 , where pickpockets are known to be rife			0
no doubt the attacker hoped to catch his victim off guard , and attempted to seize the bag @entity1 was carrying in his left hand			2
but @entity1 , who is used to fending for himself , albeit usually in less urban situations , when presenting programmes such as @entity47 , reacted ‘ instinctively ’ , according to his spokesperson , and took a swing at the man as soon as he reached for the bag catching him in the face			1
last night @entity1 ’s spokesperson confirmed he had been unharmed during the incident , nor had anything been stolen , and he had not reported it to police			2
@entity1 told his 105,000 followers about his ordeal on @entity19 , telling them his mugger had ' picked on the wrong man ' taking the strain : @entity1 , pictured on a rowing challenge , is more accustomed to using his survival skills in extreme conditions than on the streets of @entity11 it is not the first time @entity1 has narrowly avoided serious injury			1
last year he revealed how his drink had been spiked with ‘ acid ’ during a visit to a pub with some friends			0
he suffered a ‘ full on psychotic episode ’ in which he tried to jump out of a window and through a glass table			0
and he was kept in hospital for three days while tests were carried out			0
speaking of the experience , @entity1 said : ‘ it was like having an out of body experience			2
they had to lock the doors and restrain me from hurting myself			0
’ at the time the former @entity86 contestant appealed to the person responsible to come forward , having had to postpone a five - week trip to the @entity89 with the @entity90			0
@entity1 , pictured , said he fought back against the mugger as he ' wasn ¿ t prepared to let someone try and take my bag ' taking to @entity19 later on , he thanked his followers for their concern and said he had only suffered bruised knuckles in the incident on this occasion , however , he was simply using social media in order to share the experience with his followers			1
the spokesperson said : ‘ i doubt if the attacker will even look at @entity19			0
@entity26 just likes to tweet a lot about what he ’s doing and that ’s what had just happened			0
’ last night @entity1 said : ‘ i was n’t prepared to let someone try and take my bag so i fought back			2
maybe it was the right thing to do , maybe it was n’t			0
but that ’s what i did and i think it was perfectly acceptable given the situation			0
