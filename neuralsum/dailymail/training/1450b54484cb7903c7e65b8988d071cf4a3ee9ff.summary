the ring was crafted by the master goldsmith @entity18 who was a fanatical @entity1 and kicked @entity45 craftsmen out of his business in @entity47 shortly after the regime came to power in 1933 - long before laws forbidding them from working came into place			1

another more common kind of @entity1 ring is the so - called ' death 's head ring ' awarded by @entity85 , the chief engineer of the @entity86 , to officers he considered particularly loyal or courageous			2
one such ring was auctioned at @entity90 - based @entity89 in 2008			0
it had been signed by @entity85 ( pictured right ) himself and was dated to commemorate the @entity92 , when @entity2 purged a section of his own paramilitary which he considered to be challenging his authority			0
a second death ring was stolen from a museum in @entity59 in 2005 and was thought to be worth between four and 40 thousand pounds			0
