on monday evening we were treated to what has since been described as ‘ a good draw ’ for the @entity3			1
there were gasps when @entity6 were picked out to play @entity7 and you will lose count of the number of references to the old @entity12 beating the @entity13 in the 1988 fa cup final			2
over the next few weeks , @entity15 will always be @entity15 from the conference and @entity18 ’s @entity17 will be the team battling for survival in the @entity21			2
@entity22 and @entity23 will travel to either @entity24 or @entity25 in the @entity3 third round @entity24 and @entity25 will battle it out in a replay for the chance to host @entity23 likewise , you will not hear of @entity32 side @entity31 without casual references to their heroic victory at @entity35			1
@entity36 , a team immortalised by the @entity39 ’s ad in the @entity40 , or @entity41 , who used their famous sloping pitch at the old @entity44 to their advantage when they really were giant - killers , will host 11 - time @entity3 winners @entity23			1
see how easy it is to dramatise and glamourise the draw ? it could be like that every year , and in every round , if we wanted it to be			0
the draw is a random event , but a simple tweak to the @entity3 regulations would ensure that the team in the lowest league position would automatically become potential giant - killers			1
suddenly @entity61 , fourth out of the hat on monday evening , would play @entity63 at @entity64 instead of travelling to @entity65 ’s			0
@entity66 would host @entity67 at the @entity68 instead of travelling to a half - full @entity69			1
the @entity3 draw threw up many intriguing ties , including a re-run of last season 's final @entity75 would play @entity76 at @entity77 ( they have already been beaten 7 - 0 at the @entity78 this season in the @entity80 )			1
there are a number of other benefits too , such as full houses in anticipation of a giant - killing and teams from the higher division ( or league position ) would be under more pressure to play a full - strength team			1
in a few weeks ’ time , when the @entity3 third round weekend is underway , there will be the usual grumbles about clubs from the @entity21 fielding sub-strength teams			1
managers will be accused of disrespecting the oldest @entity3 competition in the world , as if the trophy itself actually has a say in it			2
there will be frequent reminders about tradition and history , but if we were such sticklers for that then the winning @entity3 - winning captain would be lifting the original trophy , commissioned in 1872			1
instead the @entity3 are on to their fourth trophy			2
it is the time for change , to accept that the competition needs some refinement if it is to move with the times and recapture some of the magic that has disappeared over the past 20 years			0
@entity119 and @entity120 will have to plot how to overcome @entity6 @entity6 striker @entity121 will cause @entity7 's defence problems with his size and power @entity6 celebrate their famous victory over @entity7 in the 1988 @entity3 final we can not convince ourselves to believe that @entity23 ’s withdrawal from the competition in 2000 , or the sensible decision to host the semi-finals at @entity132 or the abolition of multiple replays are the reasons behind its decline			2
when @entity67 do play @entity66 at the @entity69 , when @entity138 face @entity139 and @entity142 host @entity140 , there will be plenty of empty spaces			0
it is not a good look			0
the home supporters will have little appetite for it and if you care to check the record books it has been ever thus			0
a simple , prudent change - reversing the fixtures - generates excitement and enthusiasm for both clubs and their supporters			0
it is the obvious next step			0
beyond that the @entity3 , traditional and as conservative as they are , should set up a working party to look into the future of the competition			2
other options should be explored , such as a one - off invitation to one of @entity171 football ’s biggest clubs - @entity167 , @entity168 or @entity169 - to play in the competition			1
imagine @entity173 and @entity174 back in the @entity3 - but in the colours of @entity168 there have been 133 rounds of the @entity3 since its inception in 1871 and it is in desperate need of a lick of paint			1
the @entity3 could create an excuse , such as an anniversary , to bring in one of the glamour clubs from @entity171 football at the third - round stage			1
for the prestige and honour of playing in the world ’s oldest cup competition , the likes of @entity169 , @entity167 or @entity168 , as obvious examples , would accept the invitation			1
once the initial hysteria had subsided and forecasts of @entity199 had been averted , it would be something special to settle down on a sunday evening to watch @entity41 take on the @entity201			0
it would be a unique experience , something new even for @entity205 and his @entity169 players			2
@entity208 and @entity209 playing for @entity167 at @entity25 , for instance , would be something special imagine the great @entity208 travelling to @entity210 for a third round tie at @entity44 , @entity212 or the @entity68			1
they would probably go on to win the @entity214 , too			0
the inclusion of one top team from the continent in the tournament , even as a one - off , would generate excitement and an obvious commercial appeal for the @entity3			1
it might even attract a title sponsor			0
bringing overseas opposition to the party seems a touch radical , but someone needs to breathe some life into the competition			0
there have been enough changes over the years and we can only hang on to tv replays of @entity236 ’s belter in the mud at @entity238 in 1972 for so long			0
they were great days for the competition			0
there should be even greater days ahead			0
@entity244 v @entity242 @entity63 v @entity61 @entity67 v @entity66 @entity246 v @entity245 @entity248 v @entity17 @entity6 v @entity7 @entity76 v @entity75 @entity252 / @entity251 v @entity249 @entity254 v @entity253 @entity31 v @entity255 @entity142 v @entity140 @entity257 v @entity256 @entity259 v @entity258 @entity262 / @entity261 v @entity260 @entity138 v @entity139 @entity264 v @entity263 @entity266 v @entity265 @entity268 v @entity267 @entity270 v @entity269 @entity272 v @entity271 @entity274 v @entity273 @entity276 v @entity275 @entity278 v @entity277 @entity281 / @entity280 v @entity279 @entity283 v @entity282 @entity287 / @entity286 v @entity285 / @entity284 @entity289 v @entity288 @entity292 / @entity291 v @entity290 @entity294 v @entity293 @entity24 / @entity25 v @entity23 @entity297 v @entity296 @entity299 v @entity298 ties to be played across the weekend beginning january 3 .			0

@entity3 should also ask @entity168 , @entity167 and @entity169 to play
the lower - ranked team should always be at home
that would mean full *stadiums* and big teams under pressure
the @entity3 needs *freshening* up to keep it great
