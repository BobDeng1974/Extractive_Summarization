the last @entity1 man other than @entity2 to win a @entity4 singles match outside @entity5 was to be found in @entity6 on tuesday , playing at a humble futures level event			2
@entity8 reached the third round of the @entity10 and looked like making the top 100			1
the 24 - year - old made his comeback this week after a lengthy lay - off with knee problems , but lost his first round match on tuesday			1
meanwhile , barring unexpected setbacks to her rehabilitation from wrist surgery , it looks increasingly likely that @entity21 will start playing next month in some lower - tier events in @entity23 before returning to the main @entity24 in march			2
@entity8 is set to make his comeback in the @entity25 this week the 24 - year - old is making his a long - awaited return this week after a lengthy injury lay - off these were the kind of scraps of consolation being looked for at @entity33 on monday as the weekend feelgood factor for @entity1 tennis was quickly cut away like a broken racket string at the @entity25			1
the relatively bumper representation of three players on the second day were all eliminated , although there was a strain of sorrow and misfortune running through their defeats			2
@entity45 , coming in from her weekend triumph in @entity47 , was unwell and resolved to discuss with the doctor the sporadic onset of viral - type symptoms			1
2005 : the last time @entity51 had two men in the second round of the @entity25 — @entity54 and @entity55			1
both were knocked out before the fourth round			2
@entity58 gave a decent showing against @entity60 but could not win and is now flying home for the funeral of his grandmother , who passed away last week			1
@entity64 had done well to qualify but against @entity23 ’s world no 38 @entity66 he was overmatched and went out in straight sets			1
the results are a reminder that unearthing a critical mass of @entity1 players with international class remains an elusive thing			2
@entity75 @entity74 , brought in to try to invigorate the @entity77 ’s hapless attempts at producing the necessary quality , is here but he will have known the task already			0
he might cast an envious eye on the situation of his home country , now coming up with a host of exciting prospects			0
@entity45 lost in the first round of the @entity25 after feeling unwell @entity45 was the only player facing lower - ranked opposition but went down 6 - 4 , 6 - 0 to @entity89 ’s @entity88 , calling on the trainer and doctor when 2 - 5 down			1
she had felt unwell the previous day and talked of having sporadic viral - type symptoms			0
her 2013 season was wrecked by glandular fever , although she stated that she did not feel it was related to that			0
‘ i have one or two days when i feel like this			0
' i ’m going to see the doctor but i think it ’s just the way my body works , ’ she said			0
‘ it ’s very frustrating , especially as this is one of those times i want all my energy			0
’ @entity45 still plans to play in the doubles event before heading home to prepare to represent @entity51 in the @entity110 early next month in @entity111			1
after playing well for long spells in a 2 - 6 , 6 - 0 , 7 - 6 , 6 - 3 defeat to a high - quality opponent in @entity115 said he would be heading straight home to his family in @entity119			0
@entity64 was overpowered by @entity66 from the @entity23 in the opening round @entity58 put in a good performance against @entity60 - but ultimately fell to defeat ‘ my grandmother passed away five days ago			1
i ’ve lived with her a lot and it ’s been tough as we are a close family			0
i am going home for the funeral next week , at the moment that is the priority , ’ he said			2
‘ i do n’t know what i will do ( tennis-wise ) the next couple of weeks			0
’ on the court he showed how much he has improved in areas such as his speed and court coverage , but the golden rule in beating players of @entity60 ’s calibre is to take your chances when they come			0
he led 4 - 2 in the third set and had a set point at 6 - 5 in the tiebreak , before the @entity144 stepped it up			0
‘ he produced at the big moments , ’ reflected @entity58 correctly			1
it is tempting to think that if the likes of @entity64 , @entity58 , @entity149 , @entity8 , @entity45 , @entity150 and @entity151 were all fit and played to their potential ( not to mention wannabe brit @entity152 ) then there might be the makings of a nucleus to support @entity2			1
but it is a very big ‘ if ’ indeed .			0

@entity45 , @entity58 and @entity64 all *faltered* at the first stage of the @entity25
the former was struck by illness during her opening round game
elsewhere , @entity8 is making his comeback this week after a lengthy lay off with knee problems
