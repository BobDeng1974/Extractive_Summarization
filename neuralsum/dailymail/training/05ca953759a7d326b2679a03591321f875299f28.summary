welcome to the party where being a stick in the mud is not a bad thing at all			1
while feathers , sequins and skin are trademarks of @entity9 in @entity10 , there 's no room for them at the @entity13			0
at this down and dirty fiesta it 's all about swamp creatures and lashings of dark , black mud			2
and while bikinis are the outfit of choice , they 're not visible for long as one woman in a white bikini quickly discovered			0
' she 's so clean , it makes me want to hug her , ' said a reveller freshly emerged from the mud who helped the woman fit in with her muddy mates			2
' usually when you think of @entity78 , you think of sequins and feathers - not mud , ' said @entity83 tourist @entity82 , 28 , as she smeared the sludge onto the back of her neck and the few other spots clean skin was still visible			1
' it 's fun , it 's original and it 's exotic			0
' @entity92 , who owns a hotel in town , said the mud was helping her beat the intense mid-summer heat			2
' when you go to a normal " bloco " you 're all packed together like sardines and it gets insanely hot , ' said @entity92 , 43 , a vine tiara giving her swamp creature look the crowning touch			2
' the mud is really refreshing - plus i do n't even need sunscreen			0
' the @entity13 , which translates from @entity70 to @entity71 as ' @entity72 ' , takes place every year in @entity39 thousands of mud - covered party - goers parade during @entity13 , although local shopkeepers do n't let them traipse mud in their stores even with the dark slime this @entity13 devotee manages a bright orange coloured outfit - not that it will be so vibrant for long men parade their chiselled physiques in front of a spooky swamp creature during the festival party on saturday while some choose to slowly smear the black stuff on their skin , this man dives into the muddy depths head first a bright smile sparkles from the black sludge as this young woman takes to the mud during the party in @entity39 far from a centuries - old spiritual or religious occasion , this ' bloco ' is said to have been born in 1986 after local teens hiking in a nearby mangrove forest smeared themselves with mud to discourage mosquitoes and then wandered through @entity39			1
since then the festivities have evolved steadily , although local shopkeepers grew so weary of the revellers traipsing the hard - to - remove mud through the downtown and staining white walls and walkways that they banned them			1
no worry though , as party - goers now dance on the beach to a soundtrack of @entity78 funk and house music while chanting ' uga , uga ' like cavemen			1
@entity152 is said to have started in 1986 when two teenagers paraded through @entity39 covered in mud it 's not a great festival for those who wear glasses but this man does n't seem to mind as he poses for a photograph this woman wo n't let swamp creatures and black sludge deny her the chance to wear a princess crown for carnival @entity167 and old enjoy the mud during the @entity13 in @entity39 , about 250km south of the city of @entity59 locals say using the mud is a great way to cool off in the heat during @entity52 , a far cry from the sweaty and crowded city blocos two men play wrestle on the sand while mud - smeared revellers watch on roar ! being swamp creatures does n't mean this family ca n't shoot a smile down the lens as the afternoon wears on , the amount of empty beer cans on the beach multiply and mud pies begin to fly from the eager hands of teenagers while a pair of men play wrestle on the sand			1
' it 's good spirited fun , ' @entity92 said			0
' i mean , i have n't looked at myself in the mirror , i 'm sure i look ridiculous			0
but then again , everyone does			0
