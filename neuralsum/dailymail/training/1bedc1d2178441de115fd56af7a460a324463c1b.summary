as a model , @entity1 - @entity0 has to hold hard , angular poses for long periods			1
but she can go weak and floppy at any moment due to a rare muscle condition – just like a real - life rag doll			1
ms @entity0 , 22 , from @entity9 , @entity10 , suffers from a bizarre condition that makes her body go limp and weak without warning			1
the incurable condition , often nicknamed the rag doll disease , can cause ms @entity0 to lose all control of her voluntary muscles , such as those in her legs and arms			1
she had surgery to remove her thymus gland in 2013 ( pictured right ) and is waiting to see if it has been successful ms @entity0 says sometimes she will attempt to do her hair and make up , but her arms will go limp and floppy despite her ' rag doll ' condition - known as myasthenia gravis – she has worked hard to forge a successful modelling career but despite her rag doll condition - known as myasthenia gravis – ms @entity0 has managed to forge a successful modelling career			1
@entity1 - @entity0 said : ' sometimes i will go to put my hair up and suddenly my arms will just go limp and flop down to my side			1
' i 've been walking along the road before and my legs will just give way , and there 's nothing i can do			2
' it 's a condition that improves with rest so i have to talk breaks when i 'm doing activity			2
' it sounds strange but it 's just like a rag doll			0
' it can be difficult as i get very tired , but i refuse to be a slave to my condition			2
' i love modelling and i 've been able to be successful despite my health issues			2
' i 'll always do my best and i 'll never let it affect how well i do on a shoot			0
' i wo n't let my condition define me			2
' ms @entity0 began to model at the age of 17 - just as she began to experience her unusual symptoms			1
she said : ' a friend of mine was looking for people to model some dresses for a show during @entity67			1
' i thought it sounded like fun , so i told her i 'd do it			2
@entity71 is a rare long - term condition that causes certain muscles to become weak			1
it mainly affects muscles that are controlled voluntarily – often those controlling eye and eyelid movement , facial expression , chewing , swallowing and talking			0
sometimes , the muscles that control breathing , neck and limb movements are also affected			0
the muscle weakness associated with myasthenia gravis is usually worse during physical activity and improves with rest			1
it is an autoimmune condition that affects the nerves and muscles			2
autoimmune conditions are caused by the body 's immune system mistakenly attacking healthy tissue			0
in myasthenia gravis , the immune system produces antibodies ( proteins ) that block or damage muscle receptor cells			1
this prevents messages being passed from the nerve endings to the muscles , which results in the muscles not contracting ( tightening ) and becoming weak			0
it is not fully understood why some people 's immune systems produce antibodies that attack the muscle receptor cells			2
source : @entity109 ' but at around the same time i started to get very tired easily and weak for no reason at all - i was terrified i 'd fall over on the runaway in front of everyone			0
' i was very active and i did ballet , so i thought i was just doing too much			0
' i was nervous but i loved the experience of modelling , and i decided to embark on it professionally			0
' then i remember once my legs just totally gave way and i felt like a weight was pushing down on me and i could n't get up			0
' at first the doctor told her she was suffering from growing pains , but she pushed for further tests			1
eventually she was diagnosed with myasthenia gravis , an uncommon condition which affects about 15 in every 100,000 people s in the @entity130			1
ms @entity0 said : ' at first the doctor told me it was growing pains , but i knew it was something more so i pushed for further tests			1
' eventually i was diagnosed with myasthenia gravis - i 'd never even heard of it before			1
' it was very scary and such a shock to be diagnosed with something so foreign to myself , and something that even medical professionals knew little about , but i was determined to carry on with my life as normal			0
' ms @entity0 has continued to model , and even had surgery last year in the hope of treating her condition			1
she said : ' i had surgery in july 2013 to remove my thymus gland , as there is some evidence that this can help kick start the condition into remission and aid symptoms			1
' it can take up to three years to see improvement so i have a little while yet			0
' for now i 'm taking medication and i 'm trying not to let it affect me too much			0
' it can be hard as the condition is invisible , so often people do n't realise if i 'm having a particularly bad with it			2
' people can be quite insensitive at times because of their ignorance about the condition and i 'm often mistaken for being lazy which is very upsetting			2
' stress can play a big factor in worsening the symptoms so i try to stay cool and not let things affect me too much			0
ms @entity0 is able to model but has to take breaks , as her condition improves with rest now she has become a successful model , ms @entity0 wo n't let anything hold her back as her agency is based in @entity176 , she says travelling back and forth on the tube can be ' daunting ' with all the stairs and crowds ' sometimes i 've had to pass up jobs as i 've been ill - i had the opportunity to model for @entity182 but i was too unwell to accept it , and i turned down the chance to model in @entity185 as i was having surgery			1
' my agency is based in @entity176 so traveling back and forth can sometimes be daunting and scary - the idea of facing the tube on a casting day is mortifying for me with all the stairs and the crowds			0
' it 's hard sometimes to miss out on things , but it just makes me more determined to get better			0
i wo n't let anything hold me back			0
' @entity196 , ceo of @entity71 charity , @entity198 , said : ' @entity71 is a neuromuscular condition which affects the transmission of messages from nerves to muscles			0
' the brain can tell a muscle that it wants to , for example , lift up an arm , but the more the message tries to get through , the message gets weaker and weaker , until eventually the arm ca n't lift up anymore			0
' initially it can affect the facial muscles so often people are misdiagnosed with a stroke			0
' we do n't know what triggers myasthenia gravis , but women tend to be diagnosed in their 20s and 30s , whilst men are diagnosed in their 40s and 50s - our figures suggest that there around 10 to 12,000 people with the condition in the @entity130			1
' in the past , myasthenia gravis could be fatal , but these days there are medications that work very well , and people can go on to lead happy , normal lives			1
' if people want any support or information about the condition , we have a great website and a @entity237 page that sufferers of all ages will find useful			2
