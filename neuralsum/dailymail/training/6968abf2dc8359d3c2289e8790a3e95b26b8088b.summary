he said : ' whenever i travel i always keep an eye out for new adventures			2
i had seen the @entity43 online and realised that i would pass it on my way to @entity46			2
' the woods were so thick you could n't see the labyrinth at first , but then the structures appeared out of nowhere , towering above the tree line			1
' the first thing you see is a long wooden tunnel made of bent and bound sticks , shooting violently up the side of a steep hill			2
to get to the top of the labyrinth you have to get inside the tunnel and climb your way to the top			1
you have to be pretty fit to make it up there			2

mr @entity4 defiantly built a new structure alongside the motorway and continues to expand his creation while butting heads with the @entity3 authorities			1
mr @entity37 said : ' the motorway runs parallel to the structure so it 's probably not as peaceful as it once was			2
