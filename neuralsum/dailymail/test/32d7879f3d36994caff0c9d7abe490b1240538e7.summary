at the start of the year the prospect of @entity2 leading rivals @entity1 going into april 's derby at @entity4 looked extremely unlikely			1
but @entity7 's side have hit form at the right time , while the current @entity11 champions seem to have blown their chances of retaining their title after crushing defeats at @entity15 and @entity16			1
since @entity1 beat @entity2 1 - 0 last november , plenty of players have improved , some have faded , while both @entity20 and @entity21 have tinkered with their systems			1
here , @entity23 looks at how a composite xi of the sides might take shape , choosing the 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 formation both teams seem to favour			0
the @entity2 and @entity1 composite @entity30 ahead of the derby - selected by @entity23 @entity7 ( l ) and @entity21 's ( r ) sides are in contrasting form going into the @entity4 clash goalkeeper - @entity35 just gets the gloves ahead of @entity37			1
a very close call , especially given the @entity40 's form over recent weeks , but the athletic @entity41 edges it			2
@entity35 edges out @entity37 for the goalkeeper slot and has been in fine form at @entity4 this season right back - @entity45 form has been patchy this term but is the best right back either club can boast			1
@entity21 may opt for the more defensive @entity48 , but he should not do so if only so we can see @entity45 renew acquaintances with @entity51 , who elbowed him in the face last season			0
@entity45 has n't been at his best but is the best right back either club can boast at the moment centre back - @entity57 like @entity45 , not had the best of seasons but remains far above anything @entity2 currently have at centre - half			0
should be coming into his best years but appears to be going backwards			0
that said , would be some dip in form to see him miss the cut			0
@entity57 - pictured looking dejected after the defeat by @entity68 - is still the @entity70 choice centre back - @entity71 impressive in recent weeks before illness , keeping the likes of @entity74 and @entity75 quiet			0
deserves his chance to rectify his derby disaster , when he was red - carded at the @entity79 in november			0
@entity71 was sent off in the last @entity80 in november and will be looking to make amends @entity83 - @entity82 both clubs may strengthen at left back in the summer although @entity2 will want more from @entity85			0
@entity82 has done well to keep out @entity86 for long periods and is a better left back than @entity88 , despite the versatile @entity90 's sterling performances there recently			0
both @entity2 and @entity1 will be looking to strengthen at left back this summer but for now @entity82 is best fit sport analysts @entity93 are predicting @entity1 are likely to win the derby at @entity4 centre midfield - @entity96 finally getting the recognition he deserves outside of @entity4			1
at 33 he is excelling at the back of midfield in a quarterback role and has been at the heart of @entity2 's revival			2
@entity96 has been at the heart of @entity2 's revival - playing in a quarterback position in midfield centre midfield - @entity106 @entity2 's man - of - the - moment finally appears to be on the right side of @entity20 after a sluggish start			1
the box - to - box spaniard is evidence of the @entity90 's claims that given time to adapt to his methods , his players will succeed			0
@entity106 is @entity7 's man of the moment and seems to be flourishing in the manager 's system attacking midfield - @entity119 march 's player of the month is another to flourish after a sluggish opening			1
his two goals at @entity123 and understanding with @entity106 have helped @entity2 launch what looked for a long time like an unlikely assault on second place			2
@entity119 has a fine understanding with @entity106 and scored this stunning goal against @entity123 last month attacking midfield - @entity131 arguably @entity1 's greatest player of all time , the nimble - footed magician drifts effortlessly into the side			1
has remained superb despite the slump and continues to create chances for his suddenly - wasteful team - mates			0
@entity131 has remained superb despite @entity1 's slum and continues to create chances for his team - mates attacking midfield - @entity142 the @entity143 who loves the @entity145 derby			1
has scored 11 times against @entity1 and has more goals than anyone else in the long history of this fixture			2
@entity142 has scored more goals than anyone in the @entity80 and is in good form up front striker - @entity156 another underperformer who should be doing better for @entity1 , the @entity157 has not scored in his last six matches			1
that said , few would bet against him ending that run on enemy territory			0
@entity156 is another @entity1 underperformer but could end his six - game run without a goal against @entity2 @entity168 @entity2 - 6 @entity1 - 5			2

@entity2 lead @entity1 in @entity11 ahead of derby
@entity21 's side are in poor form ahead of @entity4 clash
@entity7 has found a system to suit his @entity2 squad
@entity106 , @entity119 and @entity142 are in fine form
the defence may struggle , but our xi has plenty of *playmakers* and goals
