the @entity1 church has admitted that its founder was a polygamist who married a 14 - year - old girl , breaking a lengthy silence about its history			1
@entity8 , who wrote the @entity9 and established the @entity10 , is thought to have married as many as 50 women , but for years the senior church officials did not address the subject			1
but this week the organization acknowledged that the practice took place , and named @entity17 , ' who was sealed to @entity8 several months before her 15th birthday			1
' polygamous : the @entity1 church has admitted that its founder @entity8 ( right ) had many wives - including 14 - year - old @entity17 ( pictured left much later in life ) public admission : the @entity10 of the @entity25 had stayed silent on the issue of @entity8 ; s polygamy for years			1
pictured is a statue of @entity8 and his first wife , @entity30 , in front of the church 's @entity33 headquarters estimates have placed the total number of @entity8 's wives between 27 and 50 , though the church said it is impossible to say for sure			1
however , it suggested many of his marriages may not have involved sex , and that @entity8 was reluctant to adopt the practice , which was eventually banned in 1890			1
an essay published by the church , based in @entity33 , @entity48 , describes how @entity8 said he was visited three times by angels between 1834 and 1842 who commanded him to marry more women , despite him already having a wife , @entity30			1
the third time , the essay says : ' the angel came with a drawn sword , threatening @entity8 with destruction unless he went forward and obeyed the commandment fully			1
' it is part of a recent push by the @entity10 to open up about sensitive issues within the faith , many of which are uncomfortable to discuss			1
other writings posted in the past couple of years have addressed sacred undergarments worn by devout members ; a past ban on black men in the lay clergy ; and the misconception that @entity1 are taught they 'll get their own planet in the afterlife			0
@entity77 : polygamy was outlawed by the @entity1 church in 1890			0
pictured are church leaders around that time , including @entity81 , the leader who ended the practice the latest article also makes efforts to imply that the polygamous marriages may not have been sexual			1
it makes a distinction between some unions ' for time and eternity ' - which can include sex - and some ' for eternity only ' , which are thought to have been celibate			2
the new article about @entity8 's wives during the 1830s and 1840s in @entity96 , @entity97 , and @entity98 , @entity99 , comes about 10 months after the church acknowledged polygamy was widely practiced among its members in the late 19th century			1
' as a collection , these are remarkably revealing articles , continuing the new open and transparent philosophy of historical writing , ' said @entity107 , a retired professor of sociology and religious studies at @entity110			0
the information will be surprising to many @entity25 who either did n't know or were encouraged to dismiss speculation as @entity115 propaganda , @entity107 said			0
splinter groups who call themselves fundamentalist mormons still practice plural marriage , including @entity121 ' sect on the @entity48 - @entity123 border			2
@entity25 began practicing polygamy after @entity8 received a revelation from @entity126			2
he took his first plural wife in 1830 in @entity97 , three years after he married his first wife , @entity30 , the article shows			0
he and his first plural wife separated , but he renewed the practice a decade later in @entity99 , which is where he married the teenager			0
' difficult ' : an essay published by the church describes @entity8 's reluctance to engage in plural marriage - and says the process was ' excruciating ' for his first wife , @entity30 , depicted above the essay noted that while inappropriate by today 's standards , marriage among teen girls was legal at the time			1
the article acknowledges that many details about polygamy in early @entity144 are hazy because members were taught to keep their actions confidential			2
but research has indicated that @entity8 's marriage to the young girl might not have involved sex			2
some plural marriages were designed to seal the man to the woman for eternity only , and not life and eternity as @entity1 believe , the article says			0
those types of marriages did n't seem to involve sex			0
@entity161 is known about @entity8 's marriages to the already - married women , the article says			1
they also might have been the type of unions that did n't involve sex			2
plural marriage was an ' excruciating ordeal ' for @entity170 and confounding for some men , too , the article says			0
some people left the faith , and others refused to take multiple wives while remaining @entity25			2
when @entity25 trekked cross-country to @entity48 in 1847 , nearly 200 men and more than 500 women were in plural marriage , it says			0
' difficult as it was , the introduction of plural marriage in @entity98 did indeed ' raise up seed ' unto @entity126 , ' the article says			0
' a substantial number of today 's members descend through faithful @entity25 who practiced plural marriage			0
' ' remarkable , revealing ' : experts have commented that the decision to address such issues is an unusually transparent move by the church 's leaders			0
