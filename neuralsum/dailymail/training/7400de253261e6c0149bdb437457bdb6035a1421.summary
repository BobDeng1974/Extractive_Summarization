by @entity0 last updated at 10:16 am on 18th november 2011 the ' greening ' of the @entity2 could be less to do with global warming - and more to do with rodents long - rumoured to harbour suicidal tendencies			1
scientists have found that the ' greening ' of the @entity2 many not be solely caused by global warming , as previously believed , but the environmental impact of lemmings , whose presence causes lichens to be replaced by grasses and sedge			1
scientists still do not know what the net effects of this greening might be on climate - and fear greenhouse gas being released by bacteria responsible for plant decomposition			1
unsung heroes ? a @entity26 study found that when lemmings are absent , the @entity2 tundra is likely to be more barren and covered in lichens and moss a @entity26 study found that when lemmings are absent , the @entity2 tundra is likely to be more barren and covered in lichens and moss			1
where lemmings live , on the other hand , there is a surprising increase in grass and sedge			1
as well as providing the animals with food , the plants do act as an important ' sink ' , soaking up carbon from the atmosphere			2
one reason for the trend may be the waste products of large numbers of lemmings fertilising the soil , say the researchers			0
but that in itself may have unpredictable ' feedback ' effects			0
warmer temperatures are themselves promoting the growth of grasses and shrubs which are helping to make large areas of the @entity2 more habitable			2
to study the effects of lemming populations on @entity2 ecosystems scientists measured plant cover and biomass on sites in the coastal tundra near @entity70 , @entity71 , pictured dr @entity72 , from the @entity73 at @entity74 , lead author of the study published in the journal @entity78 , said : ' our paper confirms that we really need to be careful attributing the greening of the @entity2 to global warming alone			1
' we have shown that lemmings can promote similar greening , through the increase of grasses and sedges , as warming does in @entity2 regions where lemmings are present and go through dramatic population cycles			1
' we still do n't know the relative magnitude of these two feedbacks to warming			0
a greener landscape may maintain the region as a carbon sink , however higher plant growth in a greener landscape may not be enough to offset losses of carbon from soil microbes			0
' it is plausible that herbivores , in some situations , may provide a mechanism for higher plant growth maintaining these ecosystems as carbon sinks			0
' lemming populations are known to go through historic high and low periods , but their declines are not due to ' mass suicides ' which are a myth			0
in reality lemmings migrate in large numbers when their population density becomes too great			0
some fail to survive the perils of the journey , such as crossing wide rivers			0
