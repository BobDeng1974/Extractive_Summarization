the 75 - year - old broke several teeth in the accident and was barely able to move because of the shock			1
but passers - by who dialled 999 were appalled when paramedics told them they had no ambulances available to send to the scene			0
accident : a police officer sits next to blind pensioner @entity16 , 75 , who had to lie on the pavement for 90 minutes after her fall in the end , mrs @entity2 was forced to wait almost two hours in the cold before police decided to take her to hospital themselves			1
last night an mp called for an investigation into the ‘ unacceptable ’ ambulance service response			1
mrs @entity2 said : ‘ it was quite distressing , all the time i was getting colder			0
apart from the shock , it does knock your confidence			0
i have n’t really been out on my own since			0
’ the pensioner , who walks with a white stick , fell over in her home town of @entity36 in @entity37			1
bad service : after waiting for more than 90 minutes and no ambulance appearing despite several calls for aid , police drove ms @entity16 to a hospital she added : ‘ i was a bit of a mess really			1
i fell at about 12.20pm , two people came to help me and the police stopped too			1
‘ an hour and a half later , we were still waiting for an ambulance			1
the police were concerned that i was very cold so they took the decision to try and get me in the police car and take me to hospital themselves , which they did			1
ambulance trusts across @entity56 continue to fail to hit national targets on response times , latest figures show			1
data from @entity56 reveals that the proportion of the most serious @entity61 ( @entity62 1 ) calls resulting in an emergency vehicle arriving at the scene within eight minutes was 74.6 per cent nationally in october			0
this falls short of the 75 per cent target and compares to an average of 74.7 per cent from october 2012 to september 2013			2
some trusts performed particularly poorly , with the lowest level of response meaning just 68.4per cent of calls had an emergency vehicle at the scene within eight minutes			0
four trusts out of 11 - @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 and @entity78 - failed to hit the target			0
@entity62 1 calls are the most time - critical			0
they cover severe conditions such as heart attack patients who are not breathing and do not have a pulse			0
the national average time it takes for an ambulance to reach a patient has increased by 30 seconds since 2011 , with some regions worse hit than others , those figure showed.in the @entity77 waiting times have increased by a minute and a half , more than 40per cent , while patients in the @entity97 are waiting an extra 32 seconds			2
@entity56 has allocated an extra £ 14 million to @entity56 groups commissioning ambulance services so they can secure extra staff and equipment to cover the winter months			2
‘ they kept phoning the ambulance control , who said there were no ambulances available			2
’ five days after mrs @entity2 ’s fall , 85 - year - old dementia sufferer @entity106 suffered a similar ordeal when she was forced to wait two hours on the floor of her home in @entity36 , after falling and breaking her pelvis			1
her great - nephew @entity113 , 42 , describe the situation as a ‘ disgrace ’			0
it is a bit of a sorry state of affairs for the ambulance service over those few days , between my aunt falling and the other elderly lady left on the pavement , ’ he said			1
‘ we got told that they have to prioritise , but i just do n’t think they have enough ambulances covering the area			0
‘ to have to wait two hours for medical care for an elderly person , or any age , it is just disgraceful			1
’ local @entity133 mp @entity132 said he would be demanding answers from the ambulance service , adding : ‘ they must stand accountable because it [ the waiting time ] is way beyond the target set for them			2
’ a spokesman for the @entity143 apologised for the delays			0
she said : ‘ although the service strives to attend to every patient as quickly as possible , those with serious , life - threatening conditions require a more urgent response			0

data from @entity56 reveals the proportion of the most serious calls resulting in an emergency vehicle arriving at the scene within eight minutes was 74.6 per cent nationally in october – short of the 75 per cent target .			0
