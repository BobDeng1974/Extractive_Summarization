giant mirrors will bring a @entity2 town its first rays of sunshine this winter			1
the industrial town of @entity6 is nestled deep in a valley floor in rugged @entity8			1
with the sun moving low across the sky during winter , it gets no direct sunlight between september and march			0
but that is set to change			0
helicopters have hoisted three huge mirrors into position some 450 metres above the town at the top of the valley			0
known as heliostats , they have been designed to trace the movement of the sun and reflect the light directly onto @entity6 's main square			2
helicopters have hoisted three huge mirrors into position 450 metres above the town genius : the sun beams down onto the mirrors which reflect the light onto the town of @entity6 in the valley below the idea is not new			1
it was first suggested in @entity6 100 years ago by a worker at the nearby hydroelectric @entity50 drew up the plans and won funding of about 5million kroner ( Â£ 522,700 ) for the project			1
@entity54 , the town 's mayor , told @entity56 : ' it is really special to stand in the light down on the square and feel the heat			0
this is for the pale little children of @entity6			0
' let there be light : the @entity2 town of @entity6 will receive its first ever rays of winter sunshine this year after locals set up giant mirrors to bounce light onto the town square clever : people gather in front of the town hall in sunlight which has been reflected by giant mirrors @entity2 engineer and industrialist @entity77 was concerned his workers were n't getting enough sunshine during the winter @entity81 considered the mirror idea but felt they lacked the technology to make it work so opted instead for the construction of a cable car			1
in 2006 , a similar project was successfully set up in the village of @entity89 in northern @entity90 which had suffered from exactly the same problem			2
a delegation from visited @entity89 to see how their mirror had transformed people 's lives , and was suitably impressed			0
in 2006 , a similar project was set up in the village of @entity89 in northern @entity90 which suffered from the same problem ( left ) and a ( right ) @entity6 on the map in @entity2 after five years of debate , @entity6 town council finally agreed to to build the mirrors			1
they are controlled by a computer to follow the path of then sun , adjusting to the best angle to ensure the town square is bathed in light			1
solar panels will power equipment to automatically wash the mirrors and move them into position			0
designers hope the sunshine will revitalise the town during the winter months			0
a message on the @entity6 tourist website states : ' the square will become a sunny meeting place in a town otherwise in shadow			2

industrial town of @entity6 gets no sunshine between september and march
three giant mirrors or ' heliostats ' have been set up on the mountainside
they will track the path of the sun and beam light onto the town square
idea was first suggested 100 years ago but a cable car was built instead
a similar *scheme* has been successfully *implemented* in an @entity90 village
