i tackle situations and i resolve them			0
' this is a witch hunt , everyone is out to get my husband			2
the media has made out he is to blame			2
' he loves ships , he knows all about them and has never stopped studying them , to learn what they are capable of and what their limits are			0
' he did n't stop at just sailing ships			0
that 's why for his crew he was always the go to man , a maestro			2
he is decisive , stable and lucid , he analyses situations , understands them and then acts			1
death trap : sea water flows into the @entity13 with rope and other debris strewn around inside this corridor recovery : oil workers climb in board the cruise ship as salvage crews begin preparations to pump thousands of tonnes of fuel from the vessel stricken : salvage workers start pumping from a pontoon near the ship , off the coast of @entity40 , @entity92 upturned : chairs lay strewn across this bar area in an internal shot from the @entity13 ' at times @entity96 seems arrogant because he puts himself above the people he is speaking to and often tells them to shut up			1
' he was n't in charge of the @entity13 by chance , he knows how to do his job but sometimes even those who know how to do their job can make mistakes - that 's if he did make a mistake			2
' extracts from the interview were also posted on @entity18 's website along with a gallery of photographs provided by @entity8 , 48 , among them a series of pictures showing her husband giving a safety demonstration when he was a captain with @entity117 cruise lines in 2000			1
others showed him at a desk in his cabin on another ship , or where was sat on a lifeboat of a tanker while working for @entity126 petrol giants @entity125			0

divers found the body of the 16th victim earlier today he said : ' for the time being the main focus of attention is the captain , who it has been shown was tragically inadequate but who chose him ? ' the lifeboats did not lower properly , the crew did n't know what to do , they were unprepared in dealing with an emergency , wrong orders were given such as being told to return to cabins			1
' the confusion that has emerged shows that there was an incredible lack of attention to safety procedures			1
safety should have been rehearsed beforehand			2
' you can not blame all of this carelessness on the conduct of the captain			0
that 's why this investigation can not exclude others			2
' today the death toll rose to 16 as the body of a woman was found on deck three of the @entity13 after a hole had once again been blown into the side of the ship			1
the victim was found with a life jacket and her body was taken to a mortuary on the mainland			1
the chaos in the bowels of the shipwrecked @entity13 is the worst @entity202 , a specialist cave diver , has ever seen			0
the 43 - year - old has pulled more than a few decomposing bodies from shipwrecked trawlers over the years , but has never had to tackle anything close to the size of the vast 17 - deck @entity13			1
he said : ' it is always scary , every time i go down to search the wreck , the unknown is frightening			1
' making our way through the debris is difficult and tiring			0
visibility ranges from 30 inches to four inches , and we have to check everything - floating tablecloths , discarded clothes - for bodies			2
' ' scary ' : divers working in teams spend 50 minutes at a time searching the labyrinthine corridors of the @entity13 for survivors and victims divers work together in pairs for security reasons as they search the ship at a painstakingly slow pace , often having to squeeze into confined areas where the risk of becoming trapped is great			1
they swim through the corridors and rooms in a zig - zag movement to make sure they cover every area			0
mr @entity202 said : ' we go down for 50 minutes at a time , with three oxygen tanks strapped to us , and leave one or two along the way in case we start to run out of air			0
' if we 're not back in that time , our back up races to find us			0
' one of the biggest risks is that you get tangled up in electrical cables snaking in the water			0
' the @entity13 , which boasted four swimming pools , a spa , five restaurants , 13 bars , and an array of entertainment and shopping facilities , lurched on to its side when it hit rocks off the @entity259 coast on friday , january 13			0
