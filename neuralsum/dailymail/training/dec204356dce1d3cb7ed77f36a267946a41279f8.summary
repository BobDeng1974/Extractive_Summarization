animal - mad @entity6 and his girlfriend @entity7 share their home in @entity10 , near @entity11 , with 15 dogs and two - year - old bengal tiger @entity13			1
but now there is a new addition to the family - seven month old @entity17 tiger @entity19			1
his previous owners failed to feed him the correct diet and a lack of calcium caused the bones in his legs to break			0
he also has issues with his pelvis			0
when he is a little older @entity19 will undergo corrective surgery to help sort the problem			2
until then he is following @entity13 's paw prints and prowling @entity6 's home			0
when he was young @entity13 slept with @entity6 in his bed , had a cat box and enjoyed eating on the kitchen counter			0
wild thing : mr @entity6 feeds @entity13 his 150kg @entity52 tiger at his home in @entity10 wounded animal : @entity19 has deformed legs and a damaged pelvis as a result of malnutrition			1
he will get corrective surgery when he 's older @entity19 and one of the 15 dogs he shares his home ( left ) with and enjoying a drink ( right ) however , now that he has grown up he lives happily in a special outdoor enclosure			2
meanwhile , a teething @entity19 has taken over his job of sharpening his teeth on @entity6 's furniture			1
so far @entity19 and @entity13 have only met one another through the bars of @entity13 's enclosure , but they are already fast becoming friends			2
mr @entity6 hopes to introduce them properly sometime in the future and that @entity19 will one day share the same enclosure			1
he has always dreamed of owning a tiger but finally took the plunge and got @entity13 after he was targeted twice by armed robbers			0
the younger tiger suffers from the deformities as he was not fed enough calcium earlier in his life so far @entity19 ( pictured ) and @entity81 have only met one another through the bars of @entity13 's enclosure a cuddle on the sofa : @entity19 is a rescue animal @entity86 : @entity19 stretches out by the pool after a period of acclimatisation , the two will hopefully be able to live in the same enclosure			1

@entity6 owns a @entity17 and a bengal tiger
seven month old @entity19 has deformed legs from malnutrition
mr @entity6 hopes the two will one day live in the same enclosure
