by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 published : 11:36 est , 29 january 2014 updated : 20:17 est , 29 january 2014 @entity4 yesterday dismissed a @entity6 call for him to apologise for @entity8 ’s handling of the miners ’ strike – insisting militant union leader @entity11 should say sorry for his ‘ appalling ’ conduct			1
the prime minister reacted with bemusement to @entity6 ’s launch of a ‘ justice for the coalfields ’ campaign demanding a fresh inquiry into the strike and a formal apology from the government			1
the opposition says recently - released @entity25 papers relating to the 30 - year - old dispute show the @entity8 government had a secret plan to close 75 pits and put pressure on police to crack down on pickets			1
@entity4 refused to issue an apology for the @entity8 government 's handling of the miner 's strike , but suggester then - union leader @entity11 should say sorry @entity6 mp for @entity40 @entity39 insisted at @entity13 ’s questions that miners and their families deserved an apology			1
‘ the scars of that dispute run deep in communities like @entity40 , ’ she said			0
‘ some families have never recovered and others have died waiting for justice			0
’ but mr @entity4 rejected the call , saying : ‘ i think if anyone needs to make an apology for their role in the miners ’ strike it should be @entity11 for the appalling way that he led that union			1
’ the opposition ’s campaign is apparently designed to boost support in the @entity6 heartlands			2
however it has horrified some @entity65 who are warning it appears the party is backing mr @entity11 , a hate figure for most voters , in a 30 - year - old argument			0
shadow cabinet office minister , @entity70 raised the issue in the @entity72 , challenging ministers to set out ‘ all details of the interactions between the government and the police at the time ’			1
he made his appeal in the wake of the @entity81 ' release of @entity25 papers from the 1980s which indicated that the @entity8 government had secret plans to close 75 pits and considered sending in troops to break the strike			1
the @entity90 mp , who has launched a justice for the @entity93 campaign , particularly wants communications relating to the confrontation between miners and police at @entity99 coking plant in @entity100			1
he called for action before the 30th anniversary of the so - called @entity99 on july 18			2
but @entity104 cabinet office minister @entity103 rejected the idea out of hand , insisting all of the relevant documents will be released ' in the usual way ' under the law that was passed by the last @entity6 government			2
he added : ' i was representing a coal mining constituency during the miners ' strike			2
i saw first - hand the violence , the intimidation , the divided communities , in a dispute that took place without a proper national ballot being held			0
so you asked for an apology - no. ' campaign : @entity6 want to make @entity4 issue a formal public apology for @entity8 's handling of the miners ' strike in the 1980s later at prime minister 's questions mr @entity4 went further and said @entity6 should also learn lessons from the strikes as former party leader @entity130 at the time refused to condemn the fact there was no ballot			1
he told @entity65 : ' i have to say , i think if anyone needs to make an apology for their role in the miners ' strike it should be @entity11 for the appalling way that he led that union			1
' i think while we are at it , if other people want to ask about their roles , there was the role of the leader of @entity6 , who at the time never condemned the fact that they would n't hold a ballot			2
so i think there are lessons for @entity6 to learn and judging from their performance today , they have n't learned any of them			2
' @entity6 claims that there should be a ‘ proper investigation ’ into the ugliest confrontation of the strike in 1984 , when 10,000 striking miners clashed with 5,000 police officers in what became known as the @entity99			1
confrontation : police grapple with those on the picket line at @entity168 @entity169 , who was @entity8 ’s trade and industry secretary during the strike , dismissed @entity6 ’s ‘ justice for the coalfields ’ campaign as absurd			1
‘ next they ’ll want an apology for freeing the @entity177 , ’ the @entity104 peer said			0
‘ i presume @entity179 is doing this in order to get some more money from @entity183 [ the union ]			0
‘ my recollection is that the police were principally used to protect miners who wanted to go to work and who had not been granted a ballot , but were being prevented from doing so by [ @entity191 leader ] @entity11 ’s hate mob			2
‘ neither @entity6 nor @entity11 has ever apologised for that			0
’ @entity169 added : ‘ i trust the government will merely laugh at this ridiculous campaign			0
’ it is likely to cause unease among the dwindling band of @entity199 , who will fear that the party risks alienating @entity201 by appearing to back mr @entity11 in a 30 - year - old argument			0
the move comes after the release of @entity25 papers earlier this month showing that @entity8 came within days of declaring a state of emergency and calling out the military four months into the miners ’ strike			1
scathing : @entity169 , who was @entity8 ¿ s trade and industry secretary during the strike , dismissed @entity6 's ' justice for the coalfields ' campaign as absurd dismissal : @entity169 , pictured with @entity8 in 1985 , said he presumed @entity6 was campaigning for an apology to get money from union unite ministers secretly discussed recalling @entity219 in the summer of 1984 to pass emergency legislation , according to documents released to the @entity81			1
the files show that plans were drawn up for soldiers to transport food and coal , but the idea was dismissed on the grounds that it would cause panic			0
@entity6 says the papers also suggest that the @entity8 government had a secret plan to close 75 pits at the cost of 65,000 jobs and that it sought to influence police tactics to escalate the dispute			1
industrial action was triggered in march 1984 by plans to close 20 loss - making pits			0
mr @entity11 went into battle with the @entity241 and a year - long war of attrition ensued			0
dispute : @entity6 says the papers also suggest that the @entity8 government had a secret plan to close 75 pits at the cost of 65,000 jobs strikes : industrial action was triggered in march 1984 by plans to close 20 loss - making pits			1
@entity191 leader @entity11 went into battle with the @entity241 and a year - long war of attrition ensued mr @entity70 , mp for the former pit town of @entity251 , where mr @entity11 was born , said : ‘ for those of us who lived through the strike and who saw the events and impact they had first hand , what was revealed in the @entity25 papers may not come as a surprise			2
‘ but it is no less shocking to consider that , far from being neutral , as was claimed at the time , it is clear that the government took a deliberately calculated political approach guided by a complete hostility to the coalfield communities			0
‘ that is why i am calling for justice for the coalfields			0
’ he added : ‘ ministers may want to sweep these events under the carpet , but the scars of the dispute and the subsequent closure programme remain on the memories , communities and landscapes of all coalfield communities			0
‘ they must now apologise and deliver transparency to begin to foster reconciliation with the coalfield communities			0
