@entity0 has defended @entity2 ’s form and fitness , insisting the veteran @entity5 captain does not need to be rested more often			1
@entity2 , 34 , has played every minute so far this season , including three games in a week that saw @entity5 lose to @entity9 and @entity10 in the @entity11 while stumbling to a @entity13 win over the @entity15 outsiders from @entity16 when he scored a last - minute penalty			1
@entity0 and his coaching staff are understood to be concerned that in both league games @entity20 and @entity21 were successfully deployed to stifle @entity2 and stop him distributing the ball from deep			1
@entity2 looked out of sorts in @entity5 's disappointing 3 - 1 loss against @entity10 on saturday @entity26 manager @entity0 hands out instructions to his skipper from the sidelines at @entity30 @entity5 host @entity31 on tuesday in the @entity33 , with @entity34 ( left ) in great form for the @entity37 club @entity39 striker @entity38 has been in excellent form for @entity31 and has five goals from seven starts this season as a result , the former @entity44 skipper misplaced 11 passes in the @entity10 half on saturday and gave away possession 14 times			1
@entity2 was poor against @entity10 , as his stats from the game show			1

only @entity56 ( 20 ) lost it more for @entity5			1
11 he misplaced 11 passes in the opposition half , more than any @entity5 player			1
25 % @entity2 won just 25 per cent of his duels , the worst percentage of any @entity5 player			1
only six players in last year ’s top six squads are older than @entity2 , and most now play bit - part roles			1
@entity0 has an ideal opportunity to rest @entity2 when @entity5 entertain @entity31 in the @entity33 on tuesday , although his options have been limited by fresh injuries to @entity70 and @entity71			1
asked about his captain ’s form on monday , he said : ‘ there are no concerns			1
he is a brilliant player for us			0
it was a team performance that was not up to scratch			0
we have managed his recovery really well in the last two seasons even when @entity2 was playing international football			1
if you look at his numbers and games it has been as good as ever			0
‘ he is at the age where we need to treat him individually			0
we want him to be involved in the big games because of his experience and we will always taper that recovery to allow him to be the best he can be			0
‘ we will let you know if he will be rested			2
some young players will be involved in the squad			0
’ @entity0 admitted his side have started poorly and new signings like @entity93 need time to settle @entity5 ’s run of three defeats from five @entity11 games is their second worst start to a top - flight season in 77 years			1
and @entity0 , who made nine signings this summer , accepts that some of them are struggling to come to terms with playing for a club like @entity5			1
‘ what people probably do n’t get is the pressure of playing for such a big club , ’ he added			0
‘ the weight of the jersey here is heavy for most players			0
once you adapt to playing for @entity5 you become clearer in your thinking			1
it ’s a young group and that adjustment takes a bit of time			1
when you have that transition there are little bumps along the way			0
‘ it ’s not a great start by any means but that will improve and my team will get better in the second half of the season			1
‘ when i first came in here we had a lot of new players coming in and at that time there was a new manager as well			2
we got to where we wanted to be			0
‘ of course it ’s not all smiles , it ’s not a feeling we ’ve been used to			2
but you have to refocus and move on			0
you have to be able to recover quickly at this level			0
it ’s my job to ensure confidence is retained			2
‘ we want to win a trophy this season , that is still a key objective for us and this competition gives us an opportunity			2
’ the @entity147 boss leant his support to @entity149 , who was subjected to racist abuse on sunday with @entity153 continuing to investigate allegations of racist abuse aimed at @entity5 striker @entity149 after he posted a tweet mocking @entity157 ’s 5 - 3 defeat to @entity158 on sunday , no questions about the issue were permitted at monday ’s conference			1
but @entity0 took the opportunity to back the @entity161 amid the first controversy of his @entity147 career			2
‘ every player is different , ’ he said			0
‘ i ’ve really enjoyed working with him so far			0
he ’s a good guy , he wants to do well for the club and he ’s shown he cares enough about the club to devote that time to him			2
for me , he ’s not complicated			2
he ’s a football player who wants to do well in his life and career			2
if he continues to give everything and work tirelessly for the cause there will always be an opportunity here for him			0
’ former defender @entity177 criticised @entity0 but the @entity5 boss has refused to respond meanwhile , @entity0 refused to rise to criticism from former @entity5 defender @entity177 who claimed on monday that he felt unappreciated at @entity147 before joining @entity180 in the summer			1
@entity177 said : ‘ let me put it this way , the manager and me were perhaps not on the same page in all of last season			0
for most of last season at least			0
i felt that he did n’t appreciate the things i contributed			0
when i feel that , then it ’s time to move on			2
where me and him maybe went wrong was that i ’m very direct			0
i say things as they are			0
