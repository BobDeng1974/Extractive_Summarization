click here what do you say to an @entity4 fan after his idols have won the @entity7 final ? ' switch off the @entity8 , you 've got work in the morning			1
' the gag may be naff , but illustrates their decline succinctly , even if they are restoring pride under new coach @entity15			0
the @entity4 are not in @entity16 this season			1
rival supporters in @entity20 find it hilarious , but many outside the peninsular consider @entity16 competitions incomplete without the seven - times @entity26 champions			0
@entity28 football fans over 25 hold fond memories of them thanks to @entity30			0
when calcio viewership was at its @entity28 peak in the early - to - mid - @entity33 , @entity4 ruled , winning won four league titles between 1991 - 92 and 1995 - 96			1
@entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39 ? yes please			0
@entity4 ruled in the 1990s , @entity36 and @entity35 were at the forefront of the success @entity4 posses many @entity20 national team legends too , particularly in @entity39 ( left ) and @entity38 since the turn of the century they have had entertaining tussles with @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49			1
and a couple of big nights with @entity51			0
in october 1999 @entity49 's travelling support were elated with a 1 - 1 draw against @entity4 at the @entity57 in the @entity7			1
a decade and a half later , promising @entity59 reserve @entity58 needed persuading to join the @entity20 on loan			1
what caused such a monumental tumble ? @entity4 are now in a period where they have to borrow players off teams like @entity49 , including @entity58 cost cutters cash played a part in the downsizing of this giant , though not to the extent often reported			1
@entity75 , @entity4 's parent company , founded by club president @entity74 , suffered losses earlier this decade			1
in the most remarkable clear - out in recent memory , the @entity4 sold or released a slew of high earners in 2012 - 13 's transfer windows			1
@entity83 2006 heroes @entity84 , @entity15 , @entity85 , @entity86 and @entity87 moved on			2
@entity7 winners @entity89 and @entity90 left , crown jewels @entity91 and @entity93 flew to @entity94 , enraging fans in the process			1
@entity98 forward @entity97 concluded the summer exodus and popular but fragile @entity101 striker @entity100 departed in january 2013			0
@entity91 was a @entity57 hero but was sold on to @entity94 for a large transfer fee @entity103 was tasked with leading @entity4 through a difficult financial period @entity103 , an understated , co-operative man , led an @entity91 - inspired team to the 2011 championship			1
two years later he guided his men to third place , despite the evacuation of talent			0
but the declining @entity4 were less of a draw for fans in the stadium and on the sofa			1
in january 2014 a @entity114 of bargain bucket players , prospects , misfits and veterans lost 4 - 3 to @entity119 in the league			2
@entity103 , suffocating in the toxic gloom , was dismissed			1
spirits and performances were at their lowest since the club 's humiliating relegation from @entity126 in 1982			1
but budget cutting is n't the full story			0
finance expert @entity129 covers economics for the website ' @entity132 ' ( @entity133 )			0
' @entity74 is still @entity20 's richest man			1
he could still spend € 300m a year on transfers , but his political advisers forbid it			0
in this era of austerity it would look frivolous and wasteful , ' says @entity129			0
@entity140 is one of many players who joined the club on a short - term deal @entity74 's inner circle is attuned to the political power of football			1
' his aides advise him to splash out during electoral campaigns			2
@entity4 bought @entity91 , @entity149 and @entity150 before recent elections			1
but they wo n't let @entity74 sell the team or spend heavily too often			1
both would lose public favour and votes , ' adds @entity129			0
the @entity158 club are marketing pacesetters in calcio			2
their flashy , multilingual website ( @entity162 ) and glossy club promotions are everything you 'd expect from a team owned by @entity74 - a master communicator who made his fortune from television			1
but merchandising revenue in @entity20 football is low compared with @entity173 and the @entity174			0
although they have won only three fewer @entity176 than @entity177 , @entity4 's shirt sales are miles behind the aristocratic @entity179 ' figures			1
@entity180 of leading kit sellers @entity182 says : ' there 's a correlation in results , players and sales			2
@entity150 and @entity189 jerseys sold well last season , but like most @entity20 teams , @entity4 are a tenth of where they were commercially in the 90s or early 00s			1
' @entity74 could spend heavily in the transfer market but ' political advisors forbid it ' @entity198 the frugal life , forced or not , has made club directors resourceful			1
this summer 's transfer activity was extraordinary for such a prestigious team			2
@entity4 's net expenditure was - £ 13.2m			1
the sale of @entity150 to @entity51 was the largest event			2
the club broke the transfer world record twice in the summer of 1992 , when they bought @entity208 then @entity209			2
now they are leaders in employing out of contract or unwanted stars			2
several players expected to be protagonists this season cost nothing			2
they include mercurial winger @entity217 , @entity221 icon @entity219 , former @entity177 goalkeeper @entity222 and unpredictable but committed midfielder @entity223			0
@entity150 was the latest star to leave @entity4 this summer , joining @entity51 for just £ 16m but @entity224 has started well at the @entity57 , scoring on his full debut against @entity226 on tuesday then there 's hulking @entity229 centre back @entity230 , club captain @entity231 and @entity224 , who headed his first goal in @entity20 away to @entity226 on tuesday night			1
these players , not to mention wobbly defender @entity234 and @entity235 , cost less than a ticket to the city 's famous opera house @entity239			2
supporters are n't rejoicing that their team is scrounging and scrabbling around for players			2
but it 's difficult not to admire such creative , canny dealing			2
and do n't assume that freebies are a new concept at the @entity57			2
@entity247 , @entity248 , @entity249 , @entity250 , @entity251 and @entity90 arrived for nothing in the past			0
but the volume of zero cost re-enforcements has never been this high			0
value for money includes the dugout			0
the last three coaches , @entity103 , @entity89 and current boss @entity15 , have been inexpensive			1
for all their qualities , they wo n't trouble ' world 's 20 best paid managers ' lists			1
@entity15 has switched being a poacher in the penalty area for watching on from the coaching area is the quest for success via financial sustainability bad for the image of the former glamour boys of calcio ? @entity274 of @entity275 says : ' recruiting cheap options runs the risk of damaging the brand globally			0
but they are clever to hire coaches like @entity89 and @entity15 who won the @entity7 with the club in recent years			1
the link to the " glory days " remains			0
' match day revenue is equally problematic			0
the club are synonymous with the world famous @entity57 , which resembles a futuristic car park			1
but they do n't own the ground and ca n't generate the money they 'd like			0
they want their own home with official merchandise outlets , restaurants and better facilities for fans			0
the plan is to leave the @entity57 in the next three years			2
ceo @entity299 said : ' our own stadium would allow us to compete with @entity16 's more economically powerful clubs			2
' ceo @entity299 insists @entity4 can compete with the heavyweights again at the @entity57 ( pictured ) so @entity305 , so good fans do n't obsess over spreadsheets			1
what happens on the pitch counts			0
the new look , low cost @entity4 and their young leader @entity15 started well			1
they were slick and hungry in their opening day 3 - 1 victory over @entity316 and impressed ( in attack ) in their next outing , a 5 - 4 win at @entity321			0
a cautious , passive defeat at home by champions @entity324 on saturday showed how much work is required			0
in their latest match , a midweek trip to @entity226 , the defence looked panicky			0
but the way they fought back from 2 - 0 after twenty one minutes to draw 2 - 2 showed character			0
on a good day , @entity15 's side play bold , fast football , moving the ball quickly and taking a maximum of two touches			0
@entity340 , short passes to feet and a low line to leave space for the forwards to zoom into			0
@entity4 's new era is n't the most expensive , but they are sure to entertain in @entity126 this season @entity346 presents live @entity126 games on @entity348 , and spoke to @entity15 after @entity4 's opening win over @entity316			1
' the message from @entity15 is that they 'll tolerate the occasional defeat if the other team are clearly better than them			0
but it 's unacceptable if @entity4 fail because they show less hunger and dedication than the other side			1
he is creating a strong , close - knit group , ' says @entity346			0
the recent past is ugly , the distant past a permanent reminder of the @entity4 's decline			1
this motivated , united squad and their energetic coach are worth watching though			0
the 13 - time @entity367 winners , free of @entity26 commitments , should n't be underestimated			0
if they keep up the high - scoring ( 10 goals scored , eight conceded in four league games ) fans wo n't need playstations for entertainment .			0

@entity4 ruled in the 1990s with several of the world 's biggest stars
but club are now forced to take players for free , or on loan from @entity49 in @entity224 and @entity58 's case
@entity91 , @entity93 and @entity150 have all been sold on
@entity74 is unable to splash the cash at the top
@entity103 and @entity89 have both been moved on
@entity388 is now the man in charge at the @entity57
@entity224 scored on his first start and @entity4 have started well in @entity126
