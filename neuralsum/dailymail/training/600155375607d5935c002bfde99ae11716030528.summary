@entity1 boss @entity0 feels the way his side now react to suffering their first back - to - back @entity5 losses this season will be vital to how their campaign pans out overall			1
after being beaten 3 - 0 at @entity13 last saturday and then 1 - 0 at home by @entity15 on @entity16 , the @entity1 - who came fifth last term and had been targeting the @entity12 places this time around - are 12th in the table , 11 points off the top four			1
they have only won one of their last six league games , with four of those ending in defeat , and struggled to create much going forward in what was a physical encounter with the @entity25			0
@entity0 has demanding a reaction from his players after back - to - back defeats @entity1 lost 1 - 0 at home to @entity15 on @entity16 thanks to a @entity31 penalty at @entity32 @entity0 ’s men are next in action on sunday at @entity35 , another outfit who will be keen to make the most of the opportunity to boost their points tally following a sequence of disappointing results			1
and ahead of the trip to @entity43 , the @entity42 said : ' i do n’t think in general we are lacking confidence , but i think this is a moment of the season that is pivotal for us - seeing how we can react			2
' the reaction now has to be that we make sure we know what we are doing			2
we have a real understanding of how to perform and if we can keep that , the results will come			2
' but football gives you these sorts of challenges , and this is the challenge of the season			0
we need to make sure we get through this period stronger than ever , and that could really give us a very strong second half of the season			0
' @entity0 admits @entity1 have not been ' in a great moment ' of late , but was keen to stress that against @entity15 in particular ' nothing that could have gone our way did go in our favour			1
' he was critical of referee @entity69 ’s decisions to only yellow - card apparent last man @entity70 for pulling back @entity72 in the first half and then award a penalty to the visitors moments later , having adjudged @entity76 to have fouled @entity31 , who converted the spot - kick himself			1
@entity70 was only booked for pulling back @entity72 in the first half @entity31 won @entity15 's decisive penalty after he was fouled by @entity76 ( left ) @entity1 midfielder @entity79 was also surprised @entity70 was not red - carded			1
@entity79 , quoted by the @entity80 , said : ' to me , at the time , it looked as though he ( @entity72 ) was going through clear on goal			0
' @entity72 was making the forward movement and travelling a lot quicker than anybody else			0
he ( @entity70 ) was the last man so i expected the red			0
' with regard to his side ’s inability to make real inroads against @entity15 , @entity0 suggested an ' accumulation ' of things had made life difficult for the hosts			1
in what seemed a slightly backhanded compliment to the @entity25 , he said : ' what @entity15 wanted to do helped them			1
they did really well coming here and trying to stop the play , making it difficult to be an open game			0
' i think they defended really well , but i do n’t think we have seen a good spectacle because i do n’t think that was the intention of the opposition			0
' @entity0 added : ' also , we have very good , talented young players but they need a bit of direction and i did feel we missed that leadership from @entity112 and @entity113 in the second half			2
' @entity79 ( right ) became the first player to reach 100 bookings in the @entity5 @entity118 had to come off at half - time after injuring his calf during the opening 45 minutes @entity113 ( centre ) winces in pain after going over on his ankle following a collision with @entity70 goalkeeper @entity112 and skipper @entity113 were forced off at half - time due to calf and ankle problems respectively and look likely to miss the @entity35 game			0
additionally , @entity113 ’s fellow centre - back @entity130 and winger @entity132 are doubtful due to knocks they picked up in the @entity16 match			1
the fixture also saw forward @entity137 receive a fifth @entity5 booking of the season , meaning he will be suspended for sunday ’s encounter			0
@entity35 , who are 10th , head into that game off the back of three straight league defeats .			2

@entity1 suffered back - to - back defeats against @entity13 and @entity15
@entity31 penalty gave @entity15 a 1 - 0 win at @entity32 on @entity16
@entity0 wants a reaction from his side following the results
*toffees* currently *lie* 12th in the table and 11 points off the top four
