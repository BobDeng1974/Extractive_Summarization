@entity0 understands that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery , and that is how she is taking the advent of the @entity7 in @entity8			1
the @entity10 legend was not just an inspirational driving force behind the growth of women 's tennis , but also the playing of the sport in the team format , having first founded the concept with her own league in the mid seventies			2
on sunday night she was bringing her @entity22 event to @entity24 's @entity23 , at a time when players joining up under the banner of a group outfit is suddenly all the rage			1
@entity0 has looked at the four - team league currently going in @entity8 , and might be excused for envying the nouveaux riches of the format , given the eyewatering sums they are paying the players taking part			1
@entity56 is reliably said to be collecting at least £ 2.5 million for his two appearances in @entity58 while @entity60 's fee for representing the @entity61 in three matches is believed to be around £ 1m			0
even the veterans taking part , such as @entity64 and @entity65 , are reckoned to be pocketing well in excess of £ 500,000			2
@entity67 , @entity68 , @entity31 and @entity69 pose with @entity0 ( centre ) on sunday sir @entity40 ( left ) and @entity71 ( right ) are involved in the event which takes place at the @entity23 before the @entity24 event - featuring the likes of @entity71 , @entity31 , @entity76 and @entity77 – @entity0 spoke of her delight that her longstanding concept appears to be proliferating			1
it does not trouble her that her own version in @entity10 , which takes place after @entity86 , can not afford to attract the world 's top players in the way that the @entity7 has done			1
' i 'm thrilled , it 's a form of flattery , ' she said			0
' we are celebrating our fortieth year next summer			0
it 's really important to support tennis , whatever the level			0
the @entity7 is taking professional tennis to new cities with great players			1
' i have always been in favour of the team format , always thought that children signing up to tennis should be in a team , they like to be with their friends			2
team sports are the biggest in the world , that was my background originally and that of my brother , who played @entity113			2
' in a sport where players are often resistant to any form of innovation , those participating in @entity8 and the @entity118 have clearly been enjoying themselves and embracing the concept ( as they ought to with its rewards )			1
@entity76 and @entity77 will be among the stars of the game involved in @entity0 's tournament it is a lively product and television - friendly , fitting in to modern tastes , with players showing their personality			1
it is certainly hooking people in a way that is making the worthy week - in , week - out event the @entity131 and @entity132 @entity130 look very samey by comparison			0
what nobody in the game is quite sure is how the @entity7 is making its sums add up , and how it will go forward after what looks already to have been a successful first year purely in terms of the product			1
but then in light of the deep pockets of some of the franchise owners they might not have to balance the books in the same way that more regular events do			0
@entity71 is also a supporter of the team concept : ' you 've got to remember that in the seventies team tennis was packing out stadiums , with players like @entity157 ( @entity158 ) and @entity159 ( @entity160 ) taking part , ' he said on sunday afternoon			2
@entity71 , @entity77 , sir @entity40 and @entity76 pose with @entity163 at the pre-tournament press conference ' i think the key is this having its own time slot			0
maybe the game changer part of this is that the schedule is a bit less year - round than it was			0
it 's got a bit more chance of being a success			0
' the least that the @entity7 is going to do is fuel the current debate in tennis , traditionally resistant to change , about how it needs to broaden its appeal to cater more for modern demands			2
sir @entity40 , who for twenty years has captained his team in charity matches against that of @entity0 , is also a keen advocate of the team format despite his enthusiasm for the game 's traditions			1
his sporting loves are football and tennis and , as he pointed out , he goes back a long way with both			0
he joked ' i 'm so old i can even remember ( @entity194 ) @entity193 beating ( @entity196 ) @entity195 at @entity86 in 1954			0

@entity0 has long been a *promoter* of team events
@entity22 taking place in @entity24
@entity7 proving a success in @entity8
