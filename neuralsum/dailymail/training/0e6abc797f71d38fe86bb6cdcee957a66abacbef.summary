the celebrated television director who died on @entity9 at the age of 83 was determined to help other dementia sufferers after being diagnosed with the condition in 2011			1
after lengthy discussions with wife @entity15 and son @entity16 , the family contacted the @entity18 's society and were put in contact with the @entity20			1
@entity18 's sufferer @entity1 , pictured with son @entity16 , decided to donate his brain to medical science after realising the drugs he was taking were not having any effect pulling the strings : @entity1 with some of his famous @entity2 creations @entity16 revealed his father had hit upon the idea after completing a fundraising walk saying : ' this @entity18 's business , it really is terrible is n't it ? ' @entity16 told the @entity33 : ' he kept saying it over and over again			1
i have to say i had to agree with him			1
' his father then added : ' the quicker they can find a cure the better , so they are welcome to my brain			1
' @entity16 said his father continued to raise the subject over the next few months and on one memorable occasion he announced loudly to couple they had met on holiday : ' well i 'm donating my brain to medical science '			1
proud creation : @entity48 and @entity1 on the set of @entity2 in the @entity50 with @entity51 ' yes m'lady ' : @entity2 creator @entity1 with two of his most famous puppets , @entity51 and @entity54 , at @entity55 in @entity56 in 2001 mr @entity1 , who insisted on being cremated because he did not want to ' waste space ' had been taking the drug @entity59 to treat his condition			1
it is designed to slow the advance of the disease but the effects are limited			1
at first mr @entity1 was not sure about donating his organs but changed his mind as he realised the drugs were n't having any effect			2
just months before his death @entity1 spoke of his passion to continue writing despite suffering from alzheimer 's disease			1
talking in june at his home in @entity74 , near @entity75 , @entity76 , he said : ' i 'm not worried about forgetting my career			2
it 's an odd thing this , losing one 's memory			1
‘ not everybody is affected in the same way and it 's no good going around everyday worrying about it			1
i can remember clearly things that happened 60 or 70 years ago			2
‘ i can remember conversations with friends and the actual words we used			2
my career is like an encyclopaedia			2
i made so many shows , worked with so many crew members that i can not pick out specific memories			2
‘ i can still write stories though - i can continue			2
so many people have told me that my work is instantly recognisable because within three seconds i 've blown a city apart			0
’ @entity16 said : ' despite the fact he was very confused he was obviously thinking about it			0
it mea n't something to him			0
' mr @entity1 made his name in the 1960s with a series of hit sci - fi puppet shows including @entity108 and @entity109 , but is best known for @entity2 which followed the adventures of @entity2 and the @entity112 family			0
the series - which used a form of marionette puppetry dubbed ' supermarionation ' - became hugely popular around the world			0
talking about his condition at the launch of the @entity120 ’s @entity119 , mr @entity1 said ' the bitterest blow ' was not being able to drive			0
he said : ' it meant that i could n’t go to @entity125 studios where i worked , and this depressed me enormously because my film work was my life			0
' suddenly my life was cut off			0
since i ’ve had @entity18 ’s i ’ve realised how debilitating it is			1
it can affect your life in so many ways that you do n’t think about			0
' asked how he came to realise he was suffering the condition , he said : ‘ i do n’t think i realised at all			0
it was my wife @entity15 who began to notice that i would do something quite daft like putting the kettle in the sink and waiting for it to boil			0
’ she became concerned when , in early 2010 , he took hours to return to their @entity76 home in @entity75 after forgetting his route from @entity125 , a journey he had made for decades			0
his wife persuaded him to visit a doctor , where he was asked to copy a series of simple geometric drawings			0
he thought it would be a simple task — only to realise he was hopeless at it .			0
