by @entity0 saturday 's battering of @entity3 has put @entity4 firmly in charge of the title race and , with @entity7 in the driving seat , they have the perfect man to get them over the line			1
@entity7 has won league titles at every club he has managed , so he knows exactly what it takes			2
he insists on calling this @entity4 team underdogs , but they are nothing of the sort			2
after a poor result against @entity22 , they reacted well with an easy victory over @entity24 and by absolutely thumping one of their title rivals			0
previous : @entity4 boss @entity7 knows what 's required in order win league titles , as his record shows not convincing anyone : @entity7 may say his team are still underdogs in the title race , but they 're definitely not @entity34 : @entity4 ran riot in their 6 - 0 battering of fellow title contenders @entity3 at @entity38 success : @entity7 's previous title winning positions at this stage that underlined just how strong they are and what a motivator @entity7 is			1
with seven games to go , @entity7 is in exactly the same position as when he won his seven league titles – on top			2
as the table right shows , he had comfortable leads in his early years but at @entity51 and at @entity52 he demonstrated he can still win through when the going gets tough			0
with the title race so tight this season , he will look at the @entity57 game at @entity58 as one last obstacle to overcome			1
if @entity4 can get through that then they may well be celebrating come may			0
comprehensive : @entity62 scores his second of the game in the rout over @entity3 as @entity4 smash their rivals to the point : @entity62 takes the plaudits after adding to @entity3 's humiliation at @entity38 on saturday @entity71 caused a furore when he criticised his players after their 4 - 0 loss at @entity4 , but now they have responded			1
people said he risked losing the dressing room , but i ’m sorry , footballers get paid a lot of money and they have to take the stick and get on with it			0
@entity71 showed heart and you could see that reflected in @entity87 ’s performance yesterday			1
all smiles : @entity87 manager @entity71 will be pleased his players responded well to his criticism of them close up : @entity90 scores @entity87 's first goal in their stirring comeback over @entity93 triumph : the @entity87 players celebrate with @entity96 after he scored the winner over @entity93 they were unlucky to lose against @entity3 , showed some fight in @entity99 last week and came from behind to beat @entity93			1
@entity90 was the difference and he looks the type of player @entity87 fans love			0
he linked well with @entity104 , who did well , and they showed good fighting spirit			0
@entity107 has to score six more goals to equal the @entity110 record of 34 goals in a single season			1
do not be surprised if he breaks it			0
@entity107 has been phenomenal and has put himself up there with the likes of @entity116			0
he ’s been that good			0
hands up : @entity57 's @entity107 scored a hat - trick in the @entity119 ' entertaining 6 - 3 win at @entity120 on saturday deadly : @entity107 has now scored 28 @entity110 goals and is only six short of the record in one season he has eight games left to set the record and that ’s after he missed the first five of the season			1
it ’s frightening to think what he could have finished on			0
he has equalled @entity132 ’s @entity57 record of 28 @entity110 goals in a season and in terms of ability he is right up there with the @entity57 greats			1
you ca n’t compare him to @entity140 because of @entity140 ’s longevity and what he achieved with the club , but @entity107 can do anything			0
@entity57 have some tough fixtures to come but there are a few @entity107 will have his eye on , including a trip to @entity149 – @entity107 has 11 goals in five matches against them			1
partners : @entity107 and @entity154 were on top form again as @entity57 racked up another win the only minor criticism you can make is that he does n’t always perform to his potential in the big games			1
in 26 matches against @entity4 , @entity3 and the @entity163 clubs , he has only scored seven goals			2
but with @entity4 and @entity165 still to visit @entity58 , @entity107 will want to set that right			1
if he does , he could well fire @entity57 to the title			2
well done : @entity57 boss @entity168 congratulates @entity107 on his goalscoring feats at @entity120 @entity170 : the top @entity110 scorers in one single season as the table shows , @entity107 is close to becoming only the seventh player to score 30 or more @entity110 goals in a season , and is six short of @entity177 and @entity179 ’s record			1
@entity107 missed the first five games of the season and he is the only striker on the list to average more than a goal per game			2
what a result for @entity149			0
@entity187 has been under all sorts of pressure this season , but he always seems to come up trumps			0
@entity149 were the only side to win in the bottom eight , and that could be enough to keep them safe			1
their last four games are against @entity57 , @entity196 , @entity4 and @entity3 , so points on the board are vital			2
winner : @entity149 boss @entity187 motivated his team to a hugely important win over @entity202 take that : @entity205 wheels away in delight after adding @entity149 's second in their 2 - 0 win over @entity202 @entity211 ’s 3 - 0 win over @entity212 was their seventh in nine games and they now look certain to come up			1
the @entity215 is a tough league but manager @entity216 is a real personality			0
he is confident , talks well and the fans like him			0
no wonder they call him the ginger @entity7 !			0

@entity4 have the perfect manager in @entity7 to clinch them the @entity110 title
the @entity87 players responded well to criticism from their manager @entity71 by beating @entity93
do *n't* be surprised if @entity57 's @entity107 scores six more times to equal the @entity110 's record number of goals in one season - 34
@entity149 were the only team in the bottom eight to win this weekend and it could be enough to see they escape *relegation*
