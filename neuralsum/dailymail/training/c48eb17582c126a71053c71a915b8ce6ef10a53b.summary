school 's out : children spend the last few days of their summer holiday playing on @entity12 before heading back to school next week winter stroll : the scene at @entity12 looked more like winter than a summer 's day as this unseasonal chill swept across the @entity1 it coincided with an astronomical phenomenon - a blue moon			1

' last night saw northerly winds drag cold air from quite a long way north over the @entity1			2
this air was also dry , which meant there was very little moisture to help retain heat from the day , ' a @entity87 spokesman said			1

the night of cold calm last night came after a @entity137 , lightning , flash floods and landslides have wreaked havoc across @entity1 as @entity142 struck with terrifying force			1
a frightening twist to the summer : the dramatic tornado hit the seaside town of @entity147 , near @entity148 yesterday can it get any worse ? the freak weather is just one more example of the miserable weather the @entity1 has endured this summer homes and businesses were cleared and temporary shelters set up yesterday as more than two inches of rain fell in just a few hours across the @entity157			1

and in an illustration of the weather ’s powerful unpredictability , twisters were seen above @entity147 , @entity199			2
in @entity201 , @entity56 , @entity200 , 55 , an assistant headmaster , had a lucky escape after lightning struck a tree as he climbed out of his car			0

temperatures will not beas cold this evening , experts have said			0
' cloud and any rain across southeast @entity48 will clear , becoming dry			0
elsewhere , also becoming mostly dry and fine with showers dying away , but they will continue around @entity241 , western @entity40 and some western coastal areas with a southwesterly breeze , ' the @entity87 said			1
the turbulent weather will rekindle memories of the jubilee weekend in june , when street parties across the country were sullied by drizzle			0
the @entity251 river pageant also proved a nightmare for spectators , many of whom travelled to @entity256 only to be drenched by heavy showers			0
last weekend 's @entity258 was also a complete washout , with torrential rain and massive thunder storms sweeping across much of the country			0
revellers at the @entity263 and @entity264 had to brave showers , while others across the country found themselves in a marathon 12 - hour deluge			0
chaos : floodwaters surrounded the houses and local shops in the centre of @entity274 , @entity56 , in june after torrential downpours brought flooding to swathes of northern @entity48 soaked : last weekend 80,000 rain soaked revellers enjoyed the @entity280 despite the weather many of us had already rolled the barbecues back into the garden shed , resigned to the fact that the sunshine was over			0

huge events like iconic @entity1 sporting events like @entity310 were also badly hit by bad weather and only the @entity312 escaped			0
senior forecaster at @entity118 , @entity314 said : ' it is hard to point the finger at any one cause for such a disappointing summer , or indeed for the fact that this has been pretty much the sixth in a row , with 2006 the last with any lengthy periods of dry and hot weather			0
' we can say that the atmospheric circulation around the northern hemisphere has been rather weak for much of the time during those years , and this lends itself to what meteorologists call blocking , whereby a pattern of low and high pressure around the hemisphere becomes locked in for long periods as the jet stream that shapes and holds them loops lazily and extravagantly around the globe			0
' it is unfortunate for those wanting to break out the flip - flops and shorts that the @entity342 have found themselves under stagnant low pressure rather more often than high pressure			0
' high point : only during the @entity312 did good weather return , raising spirits , nit just because of the fantastic sport			0
