' my family tried to set me up on blind dates , but i was too ashamed of the way i looked			0

bitterly ashamed of her body , @entity5 barely left the house and spent all day watching television or browsing @entity56			2
she had given up all hope of finding love until a visit to her gp in 2008 gave her the motivation she needed to change her life			2
@entity5 said : ' he told me that if i did n't start to lose weight , i would need a hip replacement by the time i was 30			1
' i was absolutely mortified			0

@entity89 up with being single and told by doctors her weight was effecting her health @entity5 began her drastic diet , dropping 12st 7lb in total ( left , before , right , today ) and as each birthday approached , she convinced herself that it would be the year she found a boyfriend			1

' i did n't want to get to 30 without ever having experienced true romance			2
i think it 's every girl 's dream to find that special someone to share your life with			0
' i dreaded the first @entity81 meeting and was devastated when i found out how much i actually weighed			0

i wanted my happily - ever - after			0
' after six years of diet and exercise , @entity5 lost an incredible 12st 7lbs - just in time for her 26th birthday			1
it took @entity5 six years to reach her goal weight @entity5 joined the dating website plenty of @entity119 and was bombarded with complimentary messages from men			1

' sadly the couple split after nine months , but @entity5 does n't regret the experience and is holding out for her mr @entity151			2
now instead of hiding away , she is going on dates and gets chatted up on nights out too			0
