by @entity0 published : 07:25 est , 21 march 2013 updated : 18:36 est , 21 march 2013 chancellor @entity1 , pictured on a building site , made the house buying scheme a central plank of his budget plans to offer state - backed mortgages were mired in confusion last night over whether they could be used by the wealthy to buy second homes			1
the chancellor said the £ 130billion scheme was a ' big new step ' that would help hundreds of thousands of families buy their own home or move home as their family grows			1
but it came under fire after it emerged wealthy homeowners may be able to use it to buy second homes costing up to £ 600,000			0
shadow chancellor @entity21 dubbed it a ' spare homes subsidy ' for the rich			0
and the @entity25 warned subsidising second homes could push house prices out of the reach of locals in areas like @entity30 and the @entity31			1
@entity25 spokesman @entity32 said : ' we doubt the chancellor intends the scheme to be used for second homes , but if it is legal and possible , what would stop people ? ' experts also warned the scheme could spark a house price boom , with the taxpayer picking up the bill in the subsequent crash			2
mr @entity1 and business secretary @entity45 both ducked questions yesterday about whether people would be able to use the scheme to buy second homes			1
they insisted the aim was to help finance main homes , but said details would only be finalised following talks with the housing industry			2
mr @entity1 said : ' this is a big new step for the @entity56 , and we are going to consult on the details			1
the mortgage market is an extremely complex thing			1
' the intention of the scheme is absolutely clear – it is for people who want to get their first home , or people who have a home and want to move to a bigger home because they 've perhaps got a bigger family			1
' he added : ' if we were in a housing boom then this is not the kind of intervention you would take			2
but actually our housing market is not properly functioning at the moment			1
that kind of transaction has to be properly analysed before this scheme is launched			0
' the @entity101 yesterday made clear people would not be able to use the help to buy scheme to purchase buy - to - let properties			1
but @entity101 sources said banning existing homeowners from the scheme would penalise many who need help , such as children who need support from parents to buy a home , divorcing couples , and families who temporarily rent a home they can not sell			1
chancellor of the exchequer , @entity1 meets shadow chancellor @entity21 dangerous ? critics fear that offering government - back mortgages to people who can not afford a deposit could fuel a new property crisis chancellor @entity1 is expected to unveil more help for homebuyers and extra investment in housebuilding the mortgage guarantee part of help to buy will underwrite £ 130billion of mortgages on any property worth up to £ 600,000			1
it will be available for mortgages of between 80 and 95 per cent of a home 's value			2
so for someone able to muster a 5 per cent deposit , the government would put in 15 per cent , to enable them to access an 80 per cent loan			1
if a borrower 's property is repossessed , the government will bear part of the losses			2
a second , ' shared equity ' , part of the scheme will offer loans worth up to 20 per cent of a home 's value			2
the scheme , worth £ 3.5billion , will be rolled out next month			0
former @entity153 chancellor @entity152 warned there was a danger the larger scheme could fuel another price boom			0
he said : ' the risk is that you simply inflate house prices and you could even get into some of the problems you have seen with sub-prime			2
' example : the proposed scheme is split into two separate streams , the first ( above ) for buyers purchasing new build homes and the second ( below ) for everyone else changes : the government offered more backing for housebuilding , after figures from the @entity175 showed a sharp drop in output from the construction industry sea change : ministers believe cash - strapped second - steppers are holding up the housing market , and making it harder for first - time buyers to get on to the property ladder can i buy a house using @entity188 to buy ? if you have a 5 % deposit and want to buy a new build home , you ’ll be able to access the help to buy : equity loan scheme from 1 april 2013			1
if you want to buy a property which is either new build or an existing property , the help to buy : mortgage guarantee will be available from january 2014			2
what if i do n’t have a deposit – can i still get a mortgage ? to access a help to buy product , buyers will need a minimum 5 % deposit			1
am i guaranteed to get a mortgage ? are there any criteria i need to meet ? for both schemes , borrowers will need to meet appropriate tests to ensure they can pay back the mortgage , as well passing their chosen lender ’s credit and affordability checks			0
how much can i borrow ? subject to meeting the eligibility criteria and affordability checks , you ’ll be able to use either help to buy scheme to purchase a property with a value up to £ 600,000			0
can existing homeowners access the scheme ? yes			0
both schemes are available to home movers as well as first - time - buyers , subject to meeting the relevant eligibility criteria			0

how do i go about accessing these schemes ? help to buy : equity loan will be available from 1 april 2013			0
buyers will be able to access this through participating housebuilders and homebuy agents			0

the government will provide further details about the scheme later in the year			0
will the government be guaranteeing my mortgage payments for me ? no. @entity248 will provide guarantees to lenders on a proportion of the mortgage			1
if a borrower ’s property is repossessed , the government will cover a proportion of the losses suffered by lenders .			0
