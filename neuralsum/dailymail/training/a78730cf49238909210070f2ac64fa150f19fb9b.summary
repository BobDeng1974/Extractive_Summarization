by @entity1 reporter published : 09:20 est , 22 august 2012 updated : 10:28 est , 22 august 2012 a @entity3 man who has lived as an @entity4 for the past 20 years will be allowed to keep badger paws and eagle wings in his home after charges against him were dropped			1
father - of - six @entity10 , 60 , was due to stand trial tomorrow for keeping protected wild animal parts in his semi-detached home filled with the trappings of his @entity16 lifestyle			1
but brave @entity10 vowed to fight the court case on the grounds that it is part of his @entity21 lifestyle - even though he lives in a three - bed semi in @entity23 , @entity24			1
charges dropped : @entity26 from @entity23 , @entity24 , will not face charges over the animal parts police found in his home			1
but today a spokesman for the @entity31 confirmed the proceedings had been discontinued before he gave his evidence			2
mr @entity10 - born in @entity35 more than 6,000 miles from the plains of the @entity21 tribe - said : ' i ’m pleased they dropped it , it should n’t have come to anything in the first place			1
' common sense should have come into it far sooner but they just do n’t understand my native way of life			2
' it ’s been a big waste of money and a dreadful thing to have hanging over me			2
but i was always confident i would clear my name			2
' he refuses to reveal his original name - he only answers only to his adopted name in honour of a famous @entity21 chief			2
mr @entity10 was charged under the @entity58 and the @entity59 over the badger and eagle relics			1
he had previously appeared in court wearing a ceremonial head dress , tassled jacket , suede moccasins and a snake ’s head necklace to deny the charge at @entity23 magistrates court			1
at the time @entity70 , defending , said : ' my client @entity10 is part of a native @entity75 @entity21 tribe			1
' he has spent time living in these @entity21 communities and this is his belief			0
” the @entity21 people , split over around 13 tribes , are usually found in @entity80 , @entity81 and @entity82			0
@entity21 was originally a word given to the natives ' enemies , known as the @entity86			0
but over time the word became adopted worldwide and is even used by the @entity21 themselves			0
there are thought to be about 30,000 @entity21 left in @entity88			0
the @entity21 tribes were nearly wiped out by @entity90			0
they now have their own areas , or ' reservations ' , to live on , where they can live by their own customs and rules , but they must still obey the @entity88 law			0
a stereotypical @entity21 image might be an @entity100 with his horse			0
however horses did not exist in @entity75 until colonists arrived - but the @entity21 quickly adopted them and used them for transport			2
the case was thrown out after his defence team provided expert evidence from an animal specialist			0
@entity10 said : ' animals come first to me , there was nothing cruel about it , i would never hurt or kill an animal			1
' but as a native , when i find a dead animal i will eat it or i will use its body parts			0
' the father - of - six began living a @entity16 lifestyle after he divorced from his wife in the early 1990s			1
in 1997 he travelled to @entity88 to try and live on a red indian reservation but the @entity75 government would not let him			0
he then moved to @entity125 in 2000 where he lived in a tepee in the mountains and the forest around @entity130			1
he brought the badger paws and eagle wings back with him from @entity125 planning to turn them into a headdress			1
but he was arrested before he was able to do this when police found his collection at his three - bedroom detached house in the @entity141 suburb of @entity23			1
now the case is over they will return the items to him but have told him he will have to apply for a licence if he wants to turn them into clothing			0
he added : ' i do n’t mind i ’ve got plenty of other things i can use to make my jewellery			0
' i dress like this all the time i ’m not just some weekend @entity100			0
i do n’t put it on to show off , i put it on because i want to wear it			0
' i ’m against modern life , nobody cares about anybody else , nobody cares about mother earth			0
' the whole point of the @entity16 lifestyle is that everyone believes in mother earth and treats others who you want to be treated			1
' @entity10 is currently working in @entity168 where he is doing snake shows on the seafront for the summer season			1
the animal lover said : ' i ’ve cured thousands of people of their fear of snakes , i do n’t believe in money , i just do it to educate people			2
' i get on with animals better than most people , i ’ve got an affinity with them			0
there are no bad animals just bad keepers			0
' i ’ve owned hundreds of snakes in my time , i eat them when they die , we @entity187 do n’t believe in letting anything go to waste			2
' @entity193 , senior crown prosecutor for the @entity31 in @entity35 , confirmed charges were dropped against mr @entity10 after reservations about conflicting evidence from animal experts			1
she said : ' having considered expert evidence from a number of sources , we concluded in that there was no longer a realistic prospect of conviction in relation to the charges against mr @entity10			1

@entity10 , 60 , will be allowed to keep *endangered* badger paws and eagle wings after *conservation* charges dropped
