@entity0 insisted on friday he would have been happy to stay at @entity1 and only left for @entity2 when it became clear the club were n’t trying to keep him			1
the midfielder completed his cut - price £ 850,000 move last weekend as the crisis - hit @entity9 outfit cashed in on their prize asset			1
@entity0 , 20 , has committed to the @entity13 side until 2018 but still had two - and - a - half years left on his deal in @entity15 and had been valued at more than double the fee he was sold for			1
with the @entity18 short of money and getting by on loans , they accepted the first bid that came in – and that told @entity0 it was time to move on			2
@entity0 puts pen to paper after agreeing to join @entity26 side @entity2 from @entity1 ‘ when you ’re a @entity1 fan , it ’s hard to let go and i ’ve never experienced anything else in football up to now , ’ he said			1
‘ i definitely was n’t eager to get out the door but when the opportunity came , with everything that was happening outside football at the club , i leant towards moving away			2
‘ it all happened very quickly			0
if things had maybe happened differently off the pitch with regards to the club trying to keep me when someone came in , i might have stayed			2
i did n’t have much time to process it but it ’s done now and i ’m looking forward to a different challenge			2
’ @entity0 is adamant on - field results did n’t influence his decision , despite @entity1 lagging 13 points behind @entity47 and struggling in the fight to win promotion			1
the 20 - year - old midfielder said he was not eager to leave his boyhood club ‘ after a couple of defeats it was maybe the case that realistically we were starting to look more at the play - offs			1
obviously you go out to win every game but we knew a couple of months ago it was going to be hard to win the league			0
‘ @entity1 get to the play - offs at least			1
if i ’d still been there , they would have been good games for me to play in so none of that was a factor in trying to get out			0
nothing on the playing side made me want to move but a different opportunity came up			0
’ @entity0 is looking forward to life in the @entity26 with promotion - chasing @entity2 - albeit a hamstring injury has ruled him out of saturday 's visit of @entity73 - but admitted he ’s already pining for a return to @entity1 later in his career			1
‘ it ’s exciting to be starting out with a new team but the surroundings here are nothing compared to @entity9			2
you realise how massive @entity1 are when you go elsewhere but there ’s still a good atmosphere at @entity83			2
@entity0 claimed the @entity9 club did not try and keep him and that made his mind up to leave ‘ i ’ll be thinking about @entity1 this weekend and hopefully they can get a win at @entity88			1
i looked out for their score last week as well when our match finished and i was pleased they beat @entity93			0
‘ i ’m not really thinking about what i ’ve walked away from			0
i ’m just trying to look forward instead and it will be good to get started with @entity2 when i ’m fit again			1
‘ i ’d love to go back to @entity1 later in my career			2
the most disappointing thing about leaving is the way i went			0
i ’ve been injured so i was n’t able to play my last game knowing that would be the case and say goodbye to the fans			0
‘ i ’d obviously like to be welcomed back at some point but i understand why some supporters might not appreciate my reasons for going			0
@entity0 boards the @entity1 team bus before travelling to @entity109 in december ‘ whenever i ’m back up in @entity110 , i ’ll try to get along to a few of the games			1
but i ’d love to return to play for the club at some point , too , however many years down the line that is			1
’ @entity116 and @entity117 were among @entity0 ’s suitors and would likely have paid more money			2
but the @entity120 moved first and , while @entity0 could n’t control what @entity1 received , he was keen to join them because of how quickly opportunities to play might arise			1
under @entity123 and @entity124 , @entity2 won automatic promotion from @entity126 last season and are well placed to challenge for a second consecutive rise			1
they are keen for @entity0 to play an integral part			1
‘ the one thing i ’ve always said is if i was ever to leave @entity1 , i would n’t go somewhere where i would n’t really play			1
i wanted to give myself the best chance of getting games and @entity2 seemed the right option			2
@entity0 kisses the @entity1 badge , and admits he would love to return to the club one day ‘ the club have come really far just this season alone and won a lot of games			1
they ’ve got a new stadium to move into in two years as well and everything is going in the right direction			0
‘ i ’m hoping to improve with playing at a higher level			0
that ’s one of the main reasons i left @entity1			1
working under the new manager and @entity146 , a lot of analysis goes on behind the scenes			0
' it ’s good for a young player to come in and see a different way of doing things			0
‘ although we lost to @entity156 last saturday the boys were unlucky			0
i feel i can fit into the way they play			0
’ @entity0 netted eight goals in 21 appearances in all competitions for @entity1 before signing for @entity2 @entity0 ’s injury is short - term but he wo n’t rush back because he wants to be in the best condition possible to do himself justice			1
his lay - off will also give him time to adapt to new surroundings he admits seem strange having been with @entity1 since he was 10			2
‘ i ’m not sure when i ’m going to be back playing			0
it ’s the type of injury that can take a bit of time to heal			0
but with me just getting started , i do n’t want to rush back and get injured again			0
‘ being about a different team will be weird but everyone ’s welcomed me with open arms			0
that makes things a lot easier			0
