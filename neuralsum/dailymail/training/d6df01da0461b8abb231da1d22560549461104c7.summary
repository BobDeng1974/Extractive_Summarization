' he 's a player of quality			0
i 'm not concerned about how he 's going to fit in with our team			0
' we have a club now with a proven history of success			0
all those things go hand in hand in making @entity70 a very attractive team for players such as @entity42			1
' the 34 - year - old @entity4 captain has agreed an 18 - month contract , worth £ 3.9million a year , to move to @entity150 and will start playing in the @entity151 when their mid-season transfer window opens in july			1
@entity42 reiterated his respect for manager @entity10 and said nobody was to blame for his exit @entity42 revealed he had turned down offers from clubs in the @entity84 , @entity158 and the @entity159			1
most significantly , though , he revealed he would have committed his future to @entity4 had they offered to extend his terms when he retired from @entity90			2

that period between the summer and the end of november gave me thinking time			0
there ’s no blame and i ’m not angry about it			0

‘ i never wanted to find myself in the situation where i was coming back to play against @entity4			2
even if i went somewhere else in @entity158 i ’d be running that risk in terms of the @entity228 competitions			0
‘ also , i said to myself that if you want to play for a big team in @entity158 with a great coach then i may as well stay put as i had all that here already			0
