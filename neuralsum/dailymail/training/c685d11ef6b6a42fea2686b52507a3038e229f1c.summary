health secretary @entity0 said the planned @entity5 strike next thursday ‘ has the potential to affect patient safety to an unacceptable level ’ a mass walkout by @entity5 staff including some paramedics and emergency workers next week could cost lives , the health secretary warned last night			1
in a blunt warning to the unions , @entity0 said the planned 12 - hour strike next thursday ‘ has the potential to affect patient safety to an unacceptable level , especially at a time of intense winter pressures ’			1
five health unions , representing hundreds of thousands of @entity5 staff , are threatening to walk out next week in a long - running dispute over pay			1
a further 24 - hour strike is planned next month			2
talks to avert the strikes broke up inconclusively last night , but will resume this evening			0
but health sources said there was no more money for pay – and warned that meeting the unions ’ demands would cost thousands of jobs			2
mr @entity0 warned the unions that patients will die unless they agree to guarantee emergency cover on a national basis during the strikes , but was unable to secure an agreement			1
it means that , at present , there is no deal to provide ambulance cover for 999 calls , or to respond to national emergencies , such as a terrorist attack			0
in a letter to union leaders last night mr @entity0 warned of the danger the strike poses to patients			1
he said : ‘ today i have received a letter from @entity50 advising me of their concerns that your current plans will pose a real risk that patients with life threatening conditions are harmed			0
’ the unions – which have all attacked the government over @entity5 performance during the winter – also risk charges of hypocrisy by urging their members to walk out at a time when the service is stretched to the limit			0
the @entity70 union , which is leading negotiations , last night said union leaders would meet this lunchtime to consider providing emergency cover			0
they will then hold further talks with mr @entity0 this evening			0
@entity76 , head of health at @entity70 , last night said the unions ‘ share the government ’s concerns about patient safety and hope we can have sensible discussions tomorrow on how to resolve this dispute ’			1
she said it was encouraging that the talks are continuing , but voiced concern about the government ’s refusal to increase the overall pay offer			0
the strikes were called after mr @entity0 ruled last year that a recommended one per cent pay rise should not be paid in full			0
around 600,000 @entity5 workers in line for an automatic pay ‘ increment ’ will not also receive the one per cent			2
the mass walkout by @entity5 staff , including some paramedics and emergency workers , next thursday is over a long - running dispute over pay			1
a further 24 - hour strike by @entity5 workers is planned next month ( file picture ) the strike is potentially embarrassing for @entity107 , as it involves the party ’s three biggest donors , @entity70 , @entity110 and the @entity111			1
between them the three unions have given @entity107 an astonishing £ 25 million since mr @entity114 became party leader			0
@entity107 has refused to condemn the planned strikes – and is pressing ministers to cave in to the unions ’ demands on pay			0
but mr @entity0 warned last night that the pay demands would cost the @entity5 an extra £ 450 million – equivalent to the cost of employing 14,000 newly - qualified nurses			1
‘ at a time when the @entity5 is under unprecedented pressure , it would be totally wrong to consider any pay policy which would have the effect of forcing the local @entity5 to employ less staff , which would inevitably have a serious impact on patient care			1
’ talks today are expected to focus on redistributing the overall pay increase among @entity5 workers			2
a health source said the government ‘ can not afford to increase the overall @entity5 pay bill ’ .			2
