@entity0 feels @entity1 have given themselves a good platform to build on in their @entity5 qualifying campaign			1
@entity1 have four points from a possible nine following their 2 - 2 draw in @entity9 on tuesday night , but sit above world champions @entity11 on goal difference in third place in @entity14 they have got two tough away games out of the way and can move level on points with the @entity20 when they host @entity23 's team at @entity24 on november 14			1
@entity0 , who set up @entity26 's goal in @entity1 's 2 - 2 draw with @entity9 , shows neat control @entity29 , right , celebrates with @entity1 team - mates @entity26 , left , and @entity31 , centre , during the game @entity29 , who set up @entity26 's goal in @entity34 , told www.uefa.com : ' we took a lot of heart from the @entity11 performance ( 2 - 1 loss in @entity41 last month ) , but obviously we did n't get any points			1
on saturday we beat @entity43 1 - 0 and now we got this point			1
' so four points from a possible nine , taking into account that we 've played @entity11 and @entity9 , is a good return and we 'll try to build on that come november			2
' @entity1 survived a late onslaught after @entity51 cancelled out @entity31 's goal with 14 minutes left , but manager @entity53 was pleased with his team 's overall display			1
@entity1 held on for a point in @entity34 after conceding a late equaliser to @entity9 forward @entity51 although @entity9 created more chances , the official @entity60 statistics show @entity1 had the majority of possession and a pass completion rate of 92 per cent			0
@entity1 looked comfortable on the ball and @entity26 's goal was the culmination of two passes from @entity69 and @entity29 that ripped @entity9 apart in an instant			2
and the @entity72 winger reckons the @entity73 can be pleased with their night 's work			0
' at the start of the match , to get a point in @entity9 , who had just beaten @entity81 2 - 0 and we know how good they are after playing them in march , the majority of @entity1 fans would be happy , ' @entity29 said			0

' they went ahead with a good goal , but we showed a lot of character to bring it back to 1 - 1 and even to take it to 2 - 1			0
' towards the end i think we were a bit tired and they managed to get their second , but we showed a lot of character to hold on for 2 - 2 because towards the end they were probably the better side			0
