hello to @entity0 , goodbye to the @entity2 we have known for a lifetime			1
in the same way @entity13 ’s ‘ boot room ’ culture was consigned to the past when @entity16 arrived in 1998 , some of the traditions and methods that , for so long , were part of @entity2 ’s fabric will no longer mean what they did			1
the appointment of @entity19 , the first foreign manager to rule at @entity20 , now means they will be susceptible to the issues and changes that impacted on all other clubs in the @entity24 while @entity2 , under sir @entity25 , dominated			1
he comes with an outstanding pedigree and enters our game on the back of a tremendous summer when he led @entity42 to third place at the @entity44			0
he knows what he wants and is n’t afraid to speak his mind			1
clearly , it is going to be his way and his alone			0
he may have chosen @entity49 to be his assistant and provide a link to the glorious past but a number of @entity19 ’s blunt comments illustrate how things are going to be so different at @entity2			1
first he was critical about the balance of the squad — could you imagine @entity59 saying that 12 months ago about the one he inherited from @entity25 ? — and he would have left board members squirming when attacking the scheduling of their lucrative @entity63 tour			1
changed days : @entity19 will get rid of some of the methods that were commonplace under sir @entity25 another bone of contention revolves around @entity68			1
he , like @entity69 , is what you would describe as being a ‘ @entity2 signing ’ rather than a @entity19 purchase			1
@entity2 scouted @entity68 more than a dozen times last season and he was joining this summer regardless of who was manager			1
@entity2 spent £ 30million to land @entity78 ’s future long - term left back , but @entity19 has called him unfit and has been tracking @entity80 ’s @entity79 and @entity82 ’s @entity81 , a player he knows inside out			1
both can play in @entity68 ’s position			2
issues such as these can cause tension behind the scenes			0
uncertain : @entity68 arrives at a @entity91 hotel on friday but will miss @entity2 's @entity24 opener on the radar : @entity94 defender @entity79 ( left ) is the subject of interest from @entity0 on the move ? @entity82 and @entity42 's @entity81 is being tracked by his former international boss @entity0 then there was his complaint about @entity101 , @entity2 ’s training base , being ‘ too exposed to wind ’ — an issue that has n’t been raised in public during the previous 14 years they had been there			1
but this is how he will put his stamp on the facility , along with two new @entity112 pitches — at a cost of £ 800,000 — to replicate exactly @entity20 ’s surface			1
something similar happened at @entity116 when @entity16 came in			0
he made the pitches at @entity116 exactly the same measurements and the same feel as @entity120			0
there were wooden shooting boards dotted around the field , which had been used daily since they were brought in by @entity125 , but @entity16 removed them all			0
he banned mobile phones , too			0
@entity16 arrived on the back of helping @entity129 win the @entity130 and @entity131 and @entity132 , @entity134 winners who cherished the boot - room philosophy , had their eyes opened to what traditionalists viewed as radical changes			0
when @entity143 followed in 2004 , coming with a c.v			0
that included two @entity147 titles and a @entity148 with @entity149 , he did things his own way too , paying no heed to what @entity16 had done			2
more changes were made to @entity116 , including the installation of a steep running hill			0
making his mark : @entity16 ( right ) made several innovative changes when he took charge of @entity13 new man : @entity143 did things his own way when he took over at @entity13 in 2004 @entity143 was single - minded and different in so many ways to @entity16			2
when he was trying to explain how a situation might unfold in a game , he used to physically move players around the pitch , pushing and pulling them into positions			0
new methods could take you aback			0
occasionally we would think to ourselves ‘ that ca n’t be right ’ as @entity16 and @entity143 tried to get their points across but , even if you did n’t agree with them , you would not think twice about doing what they said , as they had a c.v			0
to back up their actions			0
that is exactly what it will be like for @entity2 ’s players with @entity19			1
even if they doubt him , they will feel compelled to follow him			0
there will be no uncertainty , unlike the situation with @entity59 , who appeared caught between doing things his own way and trying to respect @entity2 ’s heritage			1
tradition demands @entity2 play with flying wingers			2
@entity25 did it , @entity197 and sir @entity198 did it , but @entity19 is going to dispense with that system for the time being and opt to go with three central defenders			2
i admire managers who get the most out of the squads they have to work with ; @entity19 does n’t have a winger of @entity209 ’s quality , so playing three at the back allows his three best attackers — @entity213 , @entity214 and @entity215 — to play in their best , central positions			2
leading from the front : new @entity2 captain @entity213 jogs during training on friday tough going : @entity59 appeared caught between his own methods and respecting @entity2 's heritage after a number of good results during pre-season , culminating in the 2 - 1 success against @entity149 on tuesday , has allowed optimism to build			1
but i do n’t see how a change in formation and two signings will catapult them back to the top			2
in 16 seasons at club level , @entity19 — who has won seven league titles — has finished outside the top three on just three occasions , but his aim will be to get @entity2 into the @entity134			1
i expect a strong challenge for the top four but , to get there , they still need two quality defensive additions			2
as a target , that is at odds with everything @entity2 have strived for over the past two decades			2
but these are changing times — and nothing shows that more than the man who will oversee matters against @entity250 this lunchtime			0
in charge : @entity19 dishes out orders to @entity42 players during the @entity44 in @entity256 earlier this summer i 'm hoping for another colossus like @entity258 during the middle of the best @entity44 we have seen for a long time , i lamented the lack of top - class defenders who are operating in the world game now			1
while it was terrific to see so many countries engage attack and look to score so many goals , i just felt there was something missing — a standout display , the kind we used to get from @entity274 , @entity275 and @entity276			0
players of that ilk , though , are few and far between and that has been shown by the fact that @entity281 and @entity2 , two giants of the game , were scraping to sign @entity283 from @entity284			2
he is a good defender but he could n’t displace @entity286 and @entity287			0
elation : @entity289 captain @entity258 lifts the @entity24 trophy at the end of last season we all loved seeing so many goals at the @entity44 and , of course , we will want to see the new @entity24 campaign lit up with the same kind of entertainment and flair , but i would also like to see some top - class defensive displays , too			1
i have made my admiration for @entity289 captain @entity258 clear on these pages before			1
he continues to set the standard , so it will be fascinating to see how @entity305 fares alongside him after his £ 32million move from @entity307			1
@entity13 have spent big on @entity308 and @entity2 will continue looking for a big addition until the transfer window closes			2
coaches always know that looking after the back is as important , if not more , than what happens up front			0
new man in town : @entity305 trains with @entity289 after joining from @entity307 in a £ 32m move fun and games : @entity13 's @entity308 ( right ) shares a laugh with @entity321 during training on friday my excitement at the start of the new campaign is the same as i felt when i was a young lad growing up and , all being well , the action will be just as good as last year			1
@entity329 and @entity289 are the teams to beat in the title race but there are so many other strands to follow			1
so … i 'm keeping an eye on ... how teams cope with using three at the back			0
that system seems in vogue , with a number of sides getting ready to use it , but how long will it stay that way ? it will be interesting to see what the teams do if results start going against them			0
i 'm looking forward to ... seeing @entity348 go to war with central defenders			2
with @entity353 gone , @entity329 ’s £ 32million summer signing from @entity352 looks the most likely candidate to take my old team - mate ’s role of top goalscorer — and chief villain			1
fighting them off : @entity348 ( centre ) is put under pressure during a @entity329 training session at @entity363 i 've got big hopes for ... @entity365			1
the @entity367 midfielder has been the subject of good reports and i know he was the standout player when @entity78 ’s under 20s played in @entity371 this summer			0
if the 19 - year - old progresses , he could be pushing for the senior squad at some point			0
young gun : @entity367 midfielder @entity365 could be pushing for a place in the @entity78 squad			0

@entity19 is the first foreign manager to rule at @entity20
the @entity381 knows what he wants and is *n't* afraid to speak his mind
@entity19 has called £ 30m signing @entity68 unfit
the new manager is making changes at @entity2 's training base , @entity101
@entity59 appeared caught between doing things his own way and trying to respect @entity2 's heritage
it will be fascinating to see how @entity305 will fare alongside @entity258 at @entity289
@entity329 's @entity348 looks most likely to be top scorer this season
