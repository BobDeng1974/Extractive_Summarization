pilots were forced to show off their skills yesterday as stormy weather hit the north of @entity4			0
and as this incredible video shows , planes flying into @entity6 battled against the winds that saw many appear to be ' hovering ' on their descent in			1
posted on @entity12 by user@philip2004 , the action was taken from near the airport pub close to the runway			1
' i never fear the aircraft landing but it did look nice and they will land ok			1
' i really need to get filming where i can barely stand up myself			0
' the only thing is predicting when there 's a long enough day of winds			1
' the planes were swaying in the wind but it was n't as big a deal as other days i 've seen			0
i was here for the @entity36 one last week when they had to abort the landing			1
' the wind was thought to only be around 35mph , but the direction and pressure affected the landing @entity43 , @entity45 ( @entity44 ) head of flight safety told @entity21 that pilots are well - trained to deal with a crosswind landing			1
' the pilots here are performing a cross-wind landing which we train for all the time , and which are not that unusual , ' said mr @entity43			1
' the wind is trying to push the aircraft one way , so the pilot has to point the aircraft into the wind until the last minute at which point he or she then turns the aircraft to be head on with the runway			0
' this is just one example of the need for well - trained , well - rested professional pilots			0
' mr @entity68 told @entity21 that he was always confident the plane would make a safe landing as well as capturing the windy landing for an @entity72 , he also videoed @entity73 and @entity75 planes having a less - than comfortable descent			1
last week he was on hand to catch a ' go around ' of an @entity78 when it could n't land due to high winds			2
the plane that had flown in from @entity82 came around a second time , and despite a few wobbly moments , made a safe landing			1
after getting over a period of crosswinds , the @entity72 jet approached the runway effortlessly it was by no means the most comfortable of landings , but all passengers were safe on board the manoeuvre meant the passengers were only delayed by 25 minutes ; a scheduled landing of 11.20am turned into 11.45am			2
one eyewitness told the @entity98 : ' this is a huge plane which we see come over every day and it 's quite unusual to see it do a go - around like it did			2
' in january this year , planes were battered by 100mph winds when trying to land at @entity106			2
one propeller plane - a @entity109 flight - looks particularly precarious as it swings from side to side on the approach			2
pushed sideways onto the runway , the plane almost seems to land nose - first as it struggles against the gusts			0
@entity106 is considered one of the most difficult airports to land at in the @entity119			0
its altitude sees it hit by strong winds in bad weather			0
but these skilled pilots show how flights compensate for the high winds , by approaching at an extreme angle			0
@entity128 emerged after a @entity130 storm hit the @entity119 , causing the strongest wind gusts in over 50 years .			0

*spectacular* *footage* captured by @entity12 by @entity134 on the ground
despite winds only being around 35mph , plane appears to be hovering
he tells @entity21 that he never feared any *problems* landing
