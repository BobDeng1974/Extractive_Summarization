by @entity0 published : 13:19 est , 6 march 2013 updated : 13:20 est , 6 march 2013 the discovery of an ancient woolly rhinoceros skeleton has allowed scientists to work out the average temperature of @entity5 42,000 years ago			1
the researchers discovered that average summer temperatures were about ten degrees @entity8 , while in winter temperatures dropped to about minus 22 degrees @entity8			1
therefore , at this time @entity5 was unrecognisable @entity10 tundra covered with shrubs as it was too cold for trees to grow			1
the discovery of an ancient woolly rhinoceros skeleton has allowed scientists to work out the average temperature of @entity5 42,000 years ago in total , 33 separate parts of the rhino were found including a complete cranium and lower jaw the study was led by professor @entity22 , from @entity23 , who studied the rhino skeleton , along with other remains found with it , in an attempt to gather evidence on what the environment would have been like at the time			1
the rhino skeleton was found in 2002 at @entity35 sand and gravel quarry in the valley of the @entity37 , @entity38			2
the bones were in excellent condition when they were found meaning that this represented the best example of a woolly rhinoceros found in @entity5 this century			1
in total , 33 separate parts of the rhino were found including a complete cranium and lower jaw , some of the vertebrae and ribs and the major parts of the front limbs			0
it is believed that the rhino must have become mired on the boggy edge of a river			0
in these conditions the carcass would have frozen quickly before being buried by river sediment			0
this explains why the rhino was so well preserved			0
this represented the best example of a woolly rhinoceros found in @entity5 this century the rhino was so well preserved that specimens of its last meal remained in its teeth professor @entity22 told phys.org : ' this is one of the most significant fossil finds in the last 100 years of a large mammal			1
' it 's an iconic specimen so it 's important to date it , and it correlates well with other specimens from this time in mainland @entity79			0
â€˜ as a result we can tell conditions at this time were very favourable for this species in @entity5			2
' she went on to explain that the remains of beetles and midges were found alongside the rhino and that this was particularly important as these animals are very sensitive to changes in climate meaning that they give a clear idea of the temperatures at the time			2
the findings are published in the @entity98 .			0

skeleton helped scientists work out @entity5 temperatures 42,000 years ago
summer average was ten degrees @entity8 , winter average was *-22* degrees
@entity5 was @entity10 tundra and it was too cold for trees to grow
