by @entity0 published : 19:08 est , 3 november 2013 updated : 19:09 est , 3 november 2013 research by @entity2 has shown that special offers on wine can be misleading , with some bottles sold for cheaper just months before they are the offers designed to turn shoppers ’ heads – wine at marked ‘ half - price ’ or ‘ two for £ 10 ’			1
but research appears to confirm what many have long suspected : the bargains are often not what they seem			0
six in ten bottles sold by the big supermarkets are wines on promotion			0
but stores frequently put up prices in the weeks before a wine goes on offer to make discounts seem artificially big , says price comparison website @entity2			1
the ‘ yo - yo ’ pricing can be so varied that @entity27 , @entity28 ’s and @entity29 have sold brands at a lower price when they were not on offer			1
critics say shoppers need to be wiser to retailers ’ pricing ploys but add that the public is partly to blame for allowing its buying habits to be driven by special offers			0
among the wines singled out is @entity27 ’s @entity41 , on sale yesterday at £ 5.49 , billed as half price , reduced from £ 10.99			1
according @entity2 , @entity27 has sold this wine for £ 10.99 on only 63 days in the past year , while on 58 days it was £ 4.99 – less than the supposed half - price offer			1
also at @entity27 , @entity47 ’s @entity46 was £ 4.99 , down from £ 9.99 , yet in march it was only £ 4			1
@entity28 ’s was selling @entity48 for £ 5.32 , marketed as ‘ save 33 % , was £ 7.99 ’			2
however the wine was priced at £ 7.99 for only 16 days in the past 365 , according to @entity2			2
on 148 days it was being sold for £ 4.99 – again less than the current ‘ offer ’ price			2
@entity29 had @entity53 at £ 6 , down from £ 8.50			2
but according to @entity2 it has been sold at £ 8.50 for only 85 days in the past year and had been as low as £ 5			2
and at @entity56 , @entity55 – currently on a ‘ save £ 2 ’ offer at £ 7.99 , was only £ 6.29 in april			1
' yo - yo ' pricing means that shops inflate the price of a bottle in the weeks before it goes on offer to make the discount seem larger the @entity2 research is based on store ’s websites so does not cover @entity65 , while @entity66 does not run wine promotions			1
the offers are not illegal as rules on ‘ price establishment ’ require only that the higher price cited in the promotion has applied recently for 28 consecutive days			0
nevertheless former @entity28 ’s wine buyer @entity74 said some supermarket offers were ‘ blatantly manufactured ’			0
‘ you will see a @entity77 or an @entity78 on sale for a very high price for a period of time , then discounted massively , ’ he said			0
‘ the problem is that as a nation we have become promotion junkies			0
’ most stores insisted they were simply responding to what shoppers wanted			0
@entity27 said : ‘ we realise that not every wine will be to the particular taste of every customer , but our half - price wine offers remain popular , indicating customers are satisfied with both the quality and value for money			1
’ @entity28 ’s blamed its fluctuating prices on harvest yields , transport costs and global demand			0
‘ we work hard to mitigate these and keep prices down for customers , including offering price reductions and promotions whenever possible ’ it said			0
and @entity56 took issue with the @entity2 research , pointing out that the @entity108 wine had been sold for the full price of £ 9.99 on 127 days since may .			1

' yo - yo ' pricing means supermarkets put up price before discounting
