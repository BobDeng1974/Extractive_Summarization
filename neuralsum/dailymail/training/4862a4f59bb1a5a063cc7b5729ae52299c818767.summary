a recent report found that as people upgrade from the @entity2 to the 6 and @entity3 , the amount they use their devices increases			1
in particular , people with an @entity2 were found to use their phones 55 per cent of the time compared to 80 per cent for the @entity3			0
and now a separate study has discovered that all of this extra use equates to twice the amount of mobile data , on average			0
the figures are taken from @entity18 - based @entity17 ’s latest @entity16 that collected data usage from mobile network subscribers			1
the report found @entity23 owners use twice the amount of data than the @entity23 and this is linked to 6 plus users being more engaged with their devices the figures were taken from @entity18 - based @entity17 ’s latest @entity16 that collected data usage from mobile network subscribers			1
by studying business and personal use , the report found @entity23 owners use twice the amount of data as @entity23 users , and 10 times as much as those who own the @entity39			1
' @entity23 subscribers generate the most data volume , double that of an @entity23 , ' explained the report			2
@entity43 studied more than two million articles and videos opened using its app. it compared the before - and - after behaviour of @entity23 and @entity49 users and found people with an @entity2 use their phone 55 per cent of the time			2
this increases to 72 per cent for the @entity23 and 80 per cent for the @entity23 - both at the detriment of the @entity49			0
those with the @entity23 6 now open 33 per cent more articles and videos in @entity43 than they did with a 5 or @entity2 , and those with the 6 plus open 65 per cent more items than they did with a smaller phone			0
' this increase impacts subscribers when choosing a new device [ and ] clearly the phablet sized @entity23 shows data usage patterns more akin to tablet usage			1
' in a blog post , the firm added : ' advice to those seeking to upgrade to an @entity23 : your data plan bill is about to get bigger ! ' @entity17 links this to the fact @entity23 users are typically more engaged with their devices			1
these claims are in reference to previous research , including stats by @entity43 app , which found people with the @entity23 6 open 33 per cent more articles and videos than they did with a @entity2 , and those with a 6 plus open 65 per cent more items than before			2
@entity43 found that users with both an @entity23 and an @entity49 watched significantly more content as soon as they upgraded to an @entity86			2
@entity17 ’s report also found that @entity89 networks are increasing the amount of data being used			1
by studying business and personal use , the report found @entity23 ( left ) owners use twice the amount of data than the @entity23 ( centre ) , and 10 times as much as those who own the @entity39			1
@entity17 links this to the fact @entity23 6 plus users are typically more engaged with their devices a previous study compared the before - and - after behaviour of @entity23 and @entity49 users and found people with an @entity2 use their phone 55 per cent of the time			1
this increases to 72 per cent for the @entity23 and 80 per cent for the @entity23 - both at the detriment of the @entity49 almost 80 per cent of mobile @entity110 subscribers watch videos on their phones for more than five minutes at a time , 22 per cent watch for between five and 15 minutes , and 21 per cent watch for 30 to 60 minutes at time			0
and the majority of this content is viewed on 4g networks			0
analysis from @entity120 also suggested that the way the cameras capture data on the @entity124 could also be to blame for the surge in data			1
almost 80 per cent of mobile @entity110 subscribers watch videos on their phones for more than five minutes at a time , 22 per cent watch for between five and 15 minutes , and 21 per cent watch for 30 to 60 minutes at time			0
and the majority of this content is viewed on 4g networks ( pictured ) ‘ both phones tout very similar 8 - megapixel cameras , but the image stabilisation found only on the @entity23 allows it to capture more detail , which translates to larger file sizes , ’ explained @entity130			2
she references , in particular , two identical photos taken by @entity138 editor - in - chief @entity137			0
an image taken on the @entity23 took up @entity140 of space , while the @entity23 image was 4mb			0
if these photos are then stored online or shared on social networks , this requires more data .			0

the figures were taken from @entity17 ’s latest @entity16
it collected data usage from mobile network subscribers
report found 6 @entity3 owners use twice the data as @entity23 users
this has been linked to 6 @entity3 users being more engaged with their devices
@entity17 even compares the usage of the @entity3 to that of tablet use
analysis from @entity120 also suggested that the way the cameras capture data could also be to blame for the surge in data
