by @entity0 published : 05:15 est , 29 may 2012 updated : 05:27 est , 29 may 2012 police have admitted the body of @entity3 will probably never be found 33 years after he went missing , it was claimed today			1
sources said the @entity6 have accepted @entity8 's parents , @entity9 and @entity10 , will never get the chance to bury the remains of their little boy			1
it came as @entity8 's father @entity10 took a heartbreaking bicycle ride past the site where his six - year - old son was allegedly murdered in @entity19			1
long - standing mystery : the disappearance of @entity3 in 1979 remains one of @entity24 's most notorious crimes			1
pictured right is his father @entity10 mr @entity28 , who lives just a few blocks away , got on his bike in front of his @entity33 building and pedaled past the eyeglass store that now occupies 448 west @entity35 , the @entity27 reported today			1
the shop had been a bodega when @entity38 , who was aged 18 at the time and was a stock boy there , claims he stranged @entity8			2
the 51 - year - old has told cops he killed @entity8 in the bodega 's basement may 25 , 1979 , and threw his body out with the garbage at nearby 113 @entity48			1
@entity38 claims to have lured the youngster to the store with the promise of soda and was charged with second degree murder			0
following his admission , @entity19 's @entity54 is examining its archive to try to determine where the trash might have been dumped			1
but a law - enforcement source told the @entity27 said that authorities ' are never going to undertake that kind of searching ' if the trash was taken to a landfill			1
@entity10 and @entity64 with a poster of their son , @entity8 , who went missing in 1979 , outside their apartment in @entity19 , on april 30 , 1980 scene : this is the site of the bodega in @entity33 where @entity38 claims he killed @entity8 in 1979 charged : @entity38 faced arraignment from his hospital bed , as shown in this court sketch ' killer ' : @entity38 , who was 18 in 1979 , worked in a corner shop blocks from @entity8 's home the source added : ' it would cost millions of dollars			1
you 're talking about hundreds of tons of garbage			0
' even with a search , ' you 'd probably still never find that body			1
' @entity8 's remains could have been taken to the massive fresh kills landfill on @entity89 - which was taller than the @entity90 when it closed in 2001			1
the department is also believed to have dumped garbage in the @entity93 in 1979 and taken it to an incinerator - meaning there would be no remains			1
finding the body is crucial to examining @entity38 's claim			1
the @entity101 's office needs evidence other than @entity38 's confession to prosecute him , legal experts have said			0
and so far there is no corroborating evidence , apart from from hearsay from some of his relatives and others that he told them years ago that he 'd killed a child in @entity19 , sources said			0
@entity114 : the map shows the path @entity8 would have walked after leaving his @entity33 home for the bus stop - and its proximity to the bodega where @entity38 worked @entity38 , who is reportedly schizophrenic and bipolar , is currently on suicide watch at @entity19 's @entity123			1
the suspect 's sister and a prayer group leader recently revealed @entity38 confessed to the murder during a prayer meeting in the 1980s			0
@entity129 said her brother admitted the killing during a gathering of charismatic @entity133 at @entity134 , a @entity135 in @entity136 , @entity137			0
@entity138 , the group 's leader , confirmed that he was present during the meeting , but felt he could not report the confession to police because it had n't been made to him ' one on one '			0
the pivotal meeting happened in the early 1980s , a few years after @entity8 ’s 1979 disappearance , when mr. @entity38 was in his early 20s			1
the @entity146 and @entity6 are at odds over whether @entity38 actually committed the notorious murder			0
remembered : a makeshift memorial is placed outside the premises where @entity8 allegedly disappeared relief : if true , the claims will be closure for @entity154 and @entity64 , pictured standing by a missing poster of their son outside their @entity19 apartment in april 1980 unsolved : @entity3 vanished on the way to the school bus in @entity33 , @entity19 in may 1978 inconsistencies in the bodega worker 's confession have led the @entity146 to doubt his claims , and a police source told the @entity167 the agency was ' very sceptical ' and thought the police had moved too fast			0
the paper claimed @entity38 has provided detectives with ' intimate details ' about the case that only the real killer of the six - year - old could have known			1
the exact details are not known , but could include information such as identifying characteristics on @entity28 ’s body , including scars and birth marks , or the clothing he was wearing when he disappeared 33 years ago			1
@entity38 has pleaded not guilty to second - degree murder , and the charge means prosecutors do not believe he had planned in advance to kill @entity8			2
the suspect reportedly told police he had never seen the six - year - old before the day he killed him , but then , ' i knew he was the one ... [ @entity191 ] just felt the urge to kill			2
' mourning : flowers are placed outside the @entity28 home on the day their son 's alleged killer appears in court now his family appears to have turned on the self - confessed killer , as his sister insisted that he should ' pay for what he did ' if found guilty of second - degree murder			2
@entity203 said : ' if he did something he should pay for it			0
i have kids and if something happened to them the person that did it will have to pay			0
' it does n't matter if he 's my son , my brother , my father or whatever			2
they would have to pay for what they did			0
' as @entity38 confessed his crime to police , according to @entity19 police chief @entity220 , he seemed ' remorseful ' and had a ' feeling of relief '			0
but he provided no motive for the killing			0
police say they consider @entity38 's signed confession to be reliable , having spent three and a half hours interviewing him			0
@entity8 's parents , @entity9 and @entity154 , who have never moved from the @entity33 apartment where they lived at the time of his disappearance , were taken - aback when told of the admission , but are said to have handled it well			1
the @entity28 family has always maintained that the culprit for their son 's disappearance was convicted paedophile @entity240			2
jailed for an unrelated crime , @entity240 , 68 , later told a prison cell mate he knew every stop of the bus route that took @entity8 to school and knew the six - year - old got off at the third stop			2
he admitted to taking a boy back to his apartment to rape him on the day @entity8 disappeared , but he said he let the boy go			0
he said he was ' 90 per cent sure ' it was the same boy he later saw on tv			0
no hard evidence has linked him to the crime			0
he is now in a @entity257 jail on a 20 - year sentence for abusing two boys and is due to be released in november			2
@entity8 's father has previously said : ' @entity261 is the man who abducted my child			2
we lost our child to a paedophile , and that 's not comprehensible			2
' convinced that @entity240 is guilty of the crime , mr @entity28 sends him a copy of his son 's missing child poster twice a year , with the words ' what have you done with my little boy ' written on the back			0
however , police do not believe @entity8 was sexually assaulted before his death			0
@entity8 's disappearance sparked an international manhunt in 1979 , and may 25 - the last day he was seen alive - is now @entity282 in @entity24 .			1
