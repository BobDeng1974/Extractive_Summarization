the starting point for the bamboo train of @entity2 was n't quite a station , more a collection of tumbledown rural buildings			1
but commuters on this line do n't need much of a station , because there is no waiting			2
so many ' trains ' are available , it is more like picking up a rail taxi			2
here proper trains no longer run - so people make their own			1
originally , the bogies for these trains were made from the wheels of tanks abandoned after the civil war			1
now they are made in local workshops , as are the trains ' flatbed trucks - bamboo platforms called ' nori ' , which carry passengers , livestock , rice and market goods			1
take me home , country rails : the abandoned rail line forges through lush scenery in rural @entity19 at the ' station ' , a driver settled my friend and me onto a nori right away , and started up the 6hp motor			1
the single line has 3ft - wide tracks that are warped and misaligned in places , so the nori 's small handrail was reassuring			1
clattering along at about 25mph , through miles of lush , remote scenery felt peaceful , despite the engine noise			2
the meditative rhythm of the journey was interrupted by a nori with four passengers heading right for us			2
i wondered about brakes , but there were n't any			0
each driver stopped his engine and drifted until the trains were almost bumper to bumper			2
on the rails : the ' nori ' trains have become a major attraction for tourists seeking to try an unusual sort of travel our driver asked us to get off ; we had to give way			1
the other driver helped us pick up the bamboo nori , the engine and wheels , and take them to the side of the track			1
he helped us reassemble our small train , and we were back on our way			0
two more nori came towards us			2
again , our train had to be dismantled - the number of nori , the number of passengers or size of cargo dictates who has to vacate the track			1
faster than you expect : the trains , powered by rudimentary engines , hit speeds of up to 25 miles per hour we did seem to be coming up against an unjust number of crowded nori			1
we were growing anxious to make it in time to visit the reputedly charming cafes in the village at the end of the line , and for our driver , who surely could n't spend all day with one set of passengers and make a living			0
then we met one nori , with two tourist passengers - the same as us			1
who had the right of way now ? our driver started shouting			0
the other , younger one got down and asked his passengers to dismantle their train			0
' sometimes no rules , only which driver shouting most , ' he said			0
helping hand : riders may have to move their train if they meet another carriage coming in the other direction we had a clear run then to the pretty village			0
the train back would be at our convenience			0
this is definitely one of the world 's more interesting train journeys			0
and perhaps an inspiration to frustrated commuters everywhere			0
