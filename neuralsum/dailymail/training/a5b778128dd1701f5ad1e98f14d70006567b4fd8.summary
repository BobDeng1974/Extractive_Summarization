after being told all parents had been informed the week before , ms @entity5 went home and posted her frustrations on @entity3			1
thinking the post was private , and that the school would not see it , she said : ' why is it that every single day there is something new i dislike about [ my son 's ] school ? ' are my standards really too high or are people working in the education field really just that ignorant ? ' but because she tagged the school in the post , staff were able to see what she had written despite her profile being private			1
the next morning ms @entity5 was called by the school , asking her to stop by when she dropped off her son			2
' they just felt like we were n't the right fit of parent relationship with the school and that they did n't want him as a student anymore			0
he had done nothing wrong , ' she said			0
' i was in shock			0
why would you expel a four - year - old over something his mom posts on her private @entity3 page			2

' but i had mentioned that they did n't give enough notice			0
and she 's like , " well we put it in his folder last week , " ' the four - year - old 's mother has since received a letter of dismissal saying that she broke the academy 's social media policy			0
it says : ' your relationship with @entity7 did not get off to a very good start the first day of school			0
' you utilized social media to call into question not only the integrity but the intelligence of our staff			0
