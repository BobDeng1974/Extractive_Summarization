@entity0 is under fire from angry consumers over its use of predominantly white models to promote a new clothing line inspired by the recent remake of hit musical @entity7 , which is led by an @entity11 actress			1
a @entity13 petition issued by motivational speaker @entity14 , based in @entity15 , @entity16 , calls for the retail giant to remove the ' disrespectful ' in - store displays and apologize to the movie 's 11 - year - old star , @entity19			1
' in the current stench of racism and division amongst @entity11 , why would target singlehandedly disrespect @entity19 and add more pain to injury as it relates to race relations ? ' poses ms @entity14 , a mother - of - three			1
the petition , which has gathered over 3,000 signatures in a matter of hours , concedes that @entity0 's online ads do include ' one token black girl in random @entity7 gear			1
' the in - store displays , however , cast a @entity47 girl as the star model , who happens to be wearing the collection 's main piece ; the same $ 29.99 red dress worn by @entity19 at @entity0 's collection launch			1
' that special " @entity56 " is synonymous to @entity7 - not a random model that does not look like her ! ' ms @entity14 insists			2
taking issue : the petition concedes that @entity0 's online ads do include ' one token black girl in random @entity7 gear ' ( left ) but that the in - store posters focus around white models flop : @entity7 , which was produced by @entity62 and @entity63 among others , was released on december 19 to a largely negative critical response original : the petition points out that when the 1982 movie adaption of @entity7 was released - starring the pale , freckled redhead child star @entity69 ( pictured ) - its marketing centered around @entity69 's aesthetic backlash : it also mentions the ' major uproar ' from those who were against an @entity11 being cast in the movie in the first place			1
pictured , a tweet from march after @entity19 landed the role negativity : in response to such reactions ( pictured ) the petition poses , ' is the reason why @entity0 maliciously hid @entity19 or refused to use an @entity85 to depict @entity7 in their ads ? ms @entity14 , herself a former actress raised in @entity88 , @entity89 , points out that when the 1982 movie adaption of @entity7 was released - starring the pale , freckled redhead child star @entity69 - ' everything was about @entity69 or a character / person that emulated her			1
' she argues : ' why does @entity11 actors have to beg for respect , especially as it relates to advertising ? [ sic ] ' despite most beliefs , @entity11 are capable of portraying more than drug dealers , pimps , and other bastardized portrayals of our culture			0
' @entity19 earned that role and we demand your respect			0
' pictured : the petition 's author , motivational speaker and former actress @entity14 lastly , the petition points to the ' major uproar ' from those who were against an @entity11 being cast in the movie in the first place			2
indeed , after @entity19 landed the role and appeared in the trailer for the film last march , hordes of people took to @entity123 to voice their displeasure			2

ms @entity14 poses : ' is the reason why @entity0 maliciously hid @entity19 or refused to use an @entity85 to depict @entity7 in their ads ? ' @entity7 , which was produced by @entity62 and @entity63 , among others , was released on december 19			1
its critical response has been largely negative , earning it a 29 % rating on @entity139			0
' the new - look @entity7 hints at a progressive take on a well - worn story , ' @entity139 ' consensus reads , ' but smothers its likable cast under clichés , cloying cuteness , and a distasteful materialism			2
' in a statement made to @entity149 , @entity0 representative @entity147 declined to issue an apology , stating instead : ' we had conversations with [ @entity19 ' ] team about being in the campaign , but ultimately it did not come to fruition			1
' fortunately , we had the pleasure of working with ms. @entity19 a number of times , including at a launch event in @entity89 in november			0
we had a great experience working with ms. @entity19 and appreciate her efforts in promoting this collection			0
' ms @entity147 added : ' with regard to the marketing of the collection , girls from a variety of backgrounds were featured within the campaign , reflecting that anyone can embody the spirit and character of @entity7			2
