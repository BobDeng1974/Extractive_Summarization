by @entity0 published : 12:06 est , 30 may 2013 updated : 01:50 est , 31 may 2013 @entity2 researchers have come up with a dramatic new theory for the end of the @entity5 - that humans ate them			1
the researchers say that @entity8 can be considered an ' alien invasive species ' , and point out we have already contributed to the extinction of 178 large mammals			1
today they called for further research on the bones of neanderthal man to look for signs of human tooth marks			1
lunch ? @entity2 team say @entity8 should be considered ' alien invasive species ' neanderthal man lived across @entity21 around 300,000 years ago			1
they managed to survive several ice ages before dying out around 30,000 years ago , around the same time as human beings arrived on the continent from @entity26			2
one theory for the @entity5 disappearance is that they could n't compete with humans , who had better brains and more sophisticated tools , for scarce resources such as food			1
other scientists believe they were more susceptible to the impact of climate change			0
' except in its native @entity26 , in the other continents @entity8 can be considered as an invasive alien species , ' write researchers @entity41 and @entity43 of the @entity44 in @entity45 , @entity2			1
they published their hypothesis in the may issue of the journal @entity50 - but admit they have no proof yet			0
' the only manner to test it is to find direct evidences of modern human eating marks on @entity5 remains , such cut or broken marks on bones in artifacts made by modern humans , ' he said			1
the team believe that as @entity64 spread into @entity21 and @entity65 , where homo neanderthalensis was , it was treated just another food source - and a competitor			0
' we think that modern humans , who occupied a similar ecological niche as @entity5 , directly competed with @entity5 for the food and other natural resources , ' @entity43 told @entity74			1
the researchers point out several other species have suffered similar fates , killing off their nearest relatives			0
in 2009 , researcher may have found the first evidence of the theory analysing the markings on a @entity5 jawbone found in @entity84 , south - west @entity85 during a study conducted by the @entity87			2
the cuts to the bone are similar to those left on those of deer and other animals butchered by humans in the @entity96 , the researchers say			0
neanderthal man lived across @entity21 around 300,000 years ago , and managed to survive several ice ages before dying out around 30,000 years ago , around the same time as human beings arrived on the continent from @entity26 it is believed that the flesh was eaten by humans and the teeth used to make a @entity106 end : neanderthals may have been devoured by humans who also may have used their teeth for necklaces			2
leader of the research team , @entity113 , of @entity115 's @entity114 , said : ' neanderthals met a violent end at our hands and in some cases we ate them			2
' for years , people have tried to hide away from the evidence of cannibalism , but i think we have to accept it took place			0
