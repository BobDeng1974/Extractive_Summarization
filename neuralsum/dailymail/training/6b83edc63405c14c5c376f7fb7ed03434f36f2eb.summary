by @entity0 published : 09:27 est , 23 january 2013 updated : 03:40 est , 24 january 2013 plenty of controversial dating sites are seen to objectify women , including @entity4 and @entity5 which both they encourage beautiful young women and rich men to sign up			0
but now one allows women to take control , virtually sift through a man - ventory and purchase a man to date - just as they would pick a handbag while shopping online			1
that one looks good : is online shopping for men a step too far , or just evening out the playing field ? women are encouraged to shop for male companions through an online man - market , where a catalogue of potential suitors is available to browse and evaluate			1
eligible man - products are placed in a shopping bag and eventually checked out if deemed satisfactory ( although no money actually changes hands )			1
@entity28 market themselves as an empowering and fun addition to the online dating pool			2
spokesperson for @entity33 says : ' what woman does n’t dream about having a diverse portfolio of men at her disposal ? ' women are not only receiving full access to our revolutionary " man - market " – they are able to experiment with love in a way that has never been seen before			1
' ' what woman doesn ¿ t dream about having a diverse portfolio of men at her disposal ? ' check him out : the homepage does n't hide male objectification , obvious but is it funny ? as shoppers , women may utilise the service for free while men must purchase credit packages to allow them to interact with the ladies			0
@entity28 founder @entity57 however , the romantic relationship is completely at the women ’s discretion - they choose whether or not they are interested in adding a man to their shopping bag			1
in the meantime , men can play the waiting game while they attempt to capture the attention of different female shoppers			0
' it is an understatement to say that women are in control , ' @entity33 said			0
' now , women can choose to utilize men however they see fit			0
' they can view them through the objectifying lens that men typically view them through			0
' whatever her relationship needs , @entity28 offers a bachelorette the full spectrum			2
' the launch of @entity28 also brings with it a never - before - seen experience for shoppers and man - products alike - an actual man - market shop on a @entity90 in central @entity91			1
' ladies can take a break from online shopping and come in to shop our , delectable " man - ventory , " ' @entity33 said			2
' it will also gives our man - products the opportunity to interact with interested women face - to - face , so both parties can enjoy a new depth to the experience			1
' i like that one , how about you ? the website uses terms like man - market and man - products do i get a top or a date ? online shopping for men is the latest online dating fad @entity114 are yet to receive final details of the launch date , location and opening times for the actual shop			1
because of its female - controlled structure , @entity28 claims to be ' 100 per cent harassment - free '			2
men may also take comfort in the fact that women whom they interact with are actually interested , since they have been chosen from a catalogue			0
single ladies have a chance for love , but only while supplies last			0
what if men were the shoppers ? the new site could offend men and cause double standards outrage men may take comfort in the fact that women whom they interact with are actually interested			0

women browse , evaluate and shop through an online man - market
eligible man - products are placed in a shopping bag and checked out if ' deemed satisfactory '
@entity28 are *planning* an actual ' man shop ' in central @entity91
