are @entity0 right to sack @entity1 ? one thing @entity3 would be able to guarantee , should he indeed now become @entity0 ’s next manager , is a good relationship with the finest footballer at @entity7			1
@entity1 would insist that he too has enjoyed a healthy rapport with @entity9			1
he could even point to that recent interview @entity11 gave in which he declared his support for sir @entity14 ’s successor			0
but the rumours have persisted , the fact of the matter being that @entity11 felt let down by @entity14 for retiring only a year after convincing him to move from @entity18 to @entity7			1
@entity1 just was n’t @entity14 and so the problems apparently began			2
video : scroll down to watch @entity1 and @entity3 speak support act : @entity3 ( left ) would have the backing of @entity9 with the duo pictured at @entity24 earlier this month close : @entity11 and @entity26 head coach @entity25 watch a game in @entity28 together watching on : @entity25 and @entity11 sit next to each other during @entity31 's game with @entity32 cups over runneth : @entity25 is a proven winner who has collected silverware at every club he 's managed high five ! @entity25 and the @entity0 striker have built a special relationship together @entity26 courage : @entity25 recently made @entity42 captain of the @entity44 international team whatever the truth about that particular situation , the relationship between @entity25 and @entity11 seems to be built on more solid foundations			1
it has developed from @entity25 ’s decision to appoint the @entity0 striker as captain of the @entity26 national team and has grown into something fairly rare in the sphere of modern football			1
imagine @entity57 inviting @entity58 to join him on a scouting mission			0
well , that is what @entity25 has asked @entity11 to do in recent weeks , having him attend matches between @entity24 and @entity63 , and @entity31 and @entity32			1
@entity25 has taken advantage of the fact that @entity11 has been using the medical services of the @entity26 @entity67 in @entity68 to recover from injury			1
but even so , it points to a special bond between the two men			0
@entity73 to trot : @entity1 failed to live up to expectations as @entity0 manager in the past @entity25 has not always enjoyed such a relationship with his senior players			1
for instance , during his first spell at @entity80 he clashed with both @entity82 and @entity83			2
even with @entity11 there was a shaky start			0
before his first game as @entity44 manager , @entity25 asked the players to explain their roles in the debacle that was their @entity91 campaign			1
when @entity11 chose to remain comparatively silent on the issue , @entity25 opted to leave him out of that opening encounter with @entity94 , preferring @entity95 up front			2
@entity96 ( 1991 - 97 ) , @entity80 ( 1997 - 2000 , 2002 - 03 ) , @entity97 ( 2005 - 09 ) , @entity98 ( 2009 - 11 ) @entity99 ( 2000 - 02 , 2012 - ) club @entity100 @entity101 3 but over time he grew to like and admire @entity11 and within a year had made him his skipper ahead of @entity104			1
as things stand today , @entity0 have nothing signed with @entity25			2
on monday the @entity26 was said to be off to @entity107 for a holiday , having already asked @entity109 for more time to consider an offer he is understood to have received			1
it is , say sources in @entity44 , one of three offers on the table , with the other believed to be @entity0 and the third a club in mainland @entity116			1
@entity0 , say those same sources , would be his preference			0
he has long had an ambition to work in @entity122 and was quite at home with the idea of becoming @entity0 manager when he was named among the favourites to succeed @entity14 back in 2002			0
then , of course , @entity14 changed his mind about retiring			0
man hug : @entity11 decided to leave @entity18 for @entity7 for the chance to work with sir @entity14 grudge match ? rumours persisted all season that @entity11 and @entity1 did n't see eye to eye second season syndrome ? @entity11 has been a shadow of his former self for @entity0 this term @entity25 delivered a speech at @entity140 in january at the @entity142 tribute dinner for @entity143			1
he was said to have seen this as a chance to impress the @entity147 media			0
and he was impressive , in both his eloquence — when @entity147 , of course , is not his first language — and his success in striking the right balance for the audience			0
@entity25 has won 19 trophies in 23 years of management			2
he has won the league at every club he has managed			0
while he displayed enough humility to suggest that @entity143 has surpassed his own achievements to become the outstanding manager in @entity116 , we were left in little doubt here was the @entity26 master to @entity143 ’s apprentice			2
he told the story of how @entity143 became his assistant at @entity80			2
at their first meeting in a restaurant in the @entity172 capital , he was struck by this young , relatively diminutive @entity173 who dared remonstrate with the club president for his treatment of the outgoing sir @entity178 , despite the presence of the new manager			0
impressed by @entity143 ’s loyalty , not to mention his courage , he concluded immediately this guy would be perfect alongside him			0
most wanted : @entity25 has several offers , including @entity109 , after he takes @entity44 to the @entity185 @entity186 : @entity0 are desperate to return to winning ways after their worst season in @entity190 history the story he told at the @entity140 was followed by an acknowledgement of the manager @entity143 has now become			1
‘ i am always the “ arrogant @entity3 ” but now i am humble , ’ he said			2
‘ now , he is better than me			0
’ but @entity0 are sure to draw confidence from the confidence @entity25 clearly has in himself			2
he is arrogant , and such arrogance will be required to occupy a role that has proved so uncomfortable for @entity1			0
he would have the benefit of being the man who follows the man who followed @entity14			0
but after almost 30 years in coaching , the 62 - year - old @entity25 has his own way of doing things , and @entity0 could find him a little too uncompromising			1
he likes to run a club from top to bottom			0
‘ from the first team to the laundry , ’ said one @entity26 observer on monday			1
’ @entity214 pupil : the @entity26 helped school @entity143 ( @entity216 ) in the art of management forward thinking : the @entity26 started the revolution that led to @entity98 becoming the world 's best @entity25 lifts the 2010 @entity222 trophy - the last of 18 major honours he has won that said , his methods have delivered great success			1
he is credited with starting the revolution that has seen @entity98 become the best team in @entity116 , despite the fact he was eventually dismissed in april 2011			1
it is pretty much his system they continue to play , and he signed @entity233 , promoted younger players such as @entity235 and converted @entity236 from a winger to a defensive midfielder			0
it would appear to be a reason why @entity0 now want him .			0

@entity3 is in the frame to *replace* @entity1 at @entity7
the @entity26 has proven *pedigree* at clubs including @entity63 , @entity80 , @entity98 and the @entity44 national team
@entity25 will also have the support of out - of - sorts @entity9
@entity44 coach has several offers after the @entity185 , including @entity109
