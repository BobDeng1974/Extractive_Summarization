parents have been warned of the dangers of a simple new device freely available online which heats alcohol and allows it to be inhaled - reportedly giving the user an instant but intense high			1
released in december , the $ 35 @entity7 acts in a manner similar to a traditional vaporizer , heating and releasing intoxicating vapors which are breathed through a straw after being heated by a candle to 140 @entity14			0
bypassing the digestive system , the @entity15 causes alcohol to be ingested directly to the bloodstream through the lungs , potentially causing dangerous levels of intoxication - especially if abused			1
the @entity15 is available to buy all across the @entity22 and is legal according to its creators ' it is ill advised for experimentation among those under 21 , ' said dr. @entity28 , @entity29 at the @entity30 in @entity31 , @entity32			1
' there could be inexperienced people at parties under peer pressure who may find themselves using this method of alcohol consumption			1
' it might not be possible to self - regulate their consumption and teenagers just like adults can be drunk drivers too			1
' indicating that in research laboratory 's rats have been known to be more perceptible to alcohol addiction through inhalation , dr. @entity28 warned of the dangers of this particular method of consumption			2
' to my knowledge there have been no human studies on the effects inhaling alcohol , ' said dr. @entity28			2
' certainly in lab rats they have experimented with vapor chambers and the animals experimented upon have high levels of intoxication and addiction			0
' the @entity15 was created by @entity67 back in 2009 , but it went on sale on her website for $ 34.50 each in december as with any excessive use of alcohol , @entity28 said that teens especially risked harming their own mental development with abuse			1
' in early adolescence , the brain is not as formed and too much alcohol risks affecting its formation , ' explained dr. @entity28			0
' the device which its creators say is legal , bares striking similarities to the notorious alcohol without @entity85 device ( awol ) which mechanically vaporizes alcohol shots over the course of 20 minutes and is banned in 22 states			2
invented by @entity91 resident @entity67 in 2009 , the simple glass and metal device is offered as a novelty method to consume drinks at the bar she owns in the @entity96 , @entity97			0
the @entity15 works differently to the more traditional consumption of alcohol			1
the @entity15 transfers alcohol directly from the lungs to the bloodstream - increasing the levels of intoxication normally , when a drink is taken , alcohol is absorbed 10 percent through the stomach and 85 percent in the small intestine			1
the presence of food slows this process further , but when alcohol is inhaled , however , alcohol enters the lungs and goes directly into the bloodstream , causing a much more rapid and stronger buzz			2
however , unlike the @entity117 device which retails online in the @entity22 for around $ 250 , the @entity15 does not promise zero side effects and explicitly tells users that ' alcohol consumed through a @entity15 will be detected by a blood alcohol test			1
' over 20 states banned the @entity117 device , which was first introduced into the @entity22 in 2004/5 , amid much concern and controversy			0
the glass globe of the @entity15 is filled with a shot of liquor and put on top of a pint @entity130 heat from a tea - light candle in the bottom of the pint glass turns the alcohol gaseous inside the @entity136 from @entity91 said : ' i stick the straw through a small hole in the globe and suck in a drag of invisible @entity143 bourbon fumes			1
it ’s warm , retains its flavor and gives an instant , though brief , buzz			0
' @entity67 herself says : ' the intention is not to replace drinking			0
' however , she says , ' if the @entity15 does n’t take off , we should market it to stoners as the @entity155			2
' ' when you inhale alcohol right into the lung tissue , that gets drawn right into the blood supply immediately , so it 's a very rapid onset of the intoxicating effect , and so has obviously very high abuse potential , ' said @entity164 of the @entity165 on @entity166 at the time to the @entity167			1
@entity168 , president of @entity169 in @entity170 , @entity171 , which markets the devices , known as @entity173 , or @entity117 , said they were harmless			0
' at the end of the day , it ’s just a new way for adults to enjoy alcohol in a different manner , ' said mr. @entity168			0
the danger of vaporized alcohol entering the bloodstream directly as opposed to the digestive system means that protective impulses - such as vomiting - are bypassed			1
in fact , it is the swift infusion of alcohol to the brain that makes inhalation more addictive than regular drinking according to scientists			0
@entity192 , a professor of psychiatry at @entity194 told @entity195 that when researchers want to model alcohol addiction in rats they often expose them to air mixed with vaporized alcohol			0
when the @entity117 device was released in the @entity22 , it was banned by 22 states concerned that it would encourage reckless drinking the @entity117 claims to vaporize a single measure of liquor over the course of 20 minutes and the makes say it should not be used more than twice in 24 hours this is a standard test because it is hard to get rats to drink alcohol , but the desired dependence they seek for their results comes within a matter of days using vapor			2
' it 's a good way to addict animals , ' said @entity192 .			0

new device allows the user to directly inhale alcohol - increasing the effects on the body
experts have warned that the @entity15 - which is available to buy online - could be used by *impressionable* and inexperienced teenagers
