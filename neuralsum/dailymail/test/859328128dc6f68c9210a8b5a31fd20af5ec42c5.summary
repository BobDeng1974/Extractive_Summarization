a @entity17 - led coalition is continuing to pound anti-government forces in @entity5 mr @entity6 told @entity30 television : ' there have been - there are , obviously - flights coming from @entity3			1
every single week there are flights from @entity3 and we 've traced it and know this			2
' @entity3 needs to recognise that the @entity2 is not going to stand by while the region is destabilised or while people engage in overt warfare across lines , international boundaries in other countries			2
' the @entity2 has backed the @entity17 - led campaign , which launched air strikes last month as the rebels advanced on @entity5 's main southern city of @entity48 after seizing the capital @entity50			1
president @entity51 fled @entity48 for @entity17 during the @entity14 advance and the city has since seen heavy clashes between pro and anti-government forces			0
@entity57 has accused @entity12 , the major @entity14 power , of backing the rebels in a bid to establish a @entity62 state on its doorstep			1
but @entity3 foreign minister @entity64 insisted his government wanted a swift end to the fighting , which has cost more than 640 lives since march 19 , according to the @entity69			0
military force : @entity17 army tanks are seen deployed near the @entity17 - @entity5 border , in southwestern @entity17 patrol : @entity17 guards drive tanks and armed vehicles along the border with @entity5 mr @entity6 , fresh from world powers striking a framework agreement with @entity3 on its nuclear programme , said @entity7 was not looking for confrontation with @entity12			1
' but we 're not going to step away from our alliances and our friendships and the need to stand with those who feel threatened as a consequence of the choices that @entity3 might be making			0
' in another sign of growing @entity2 support for the @entity17 effort , the @entity89 said it had started daily aerial refuelling for warplanes in the coalition			1
the first refuelling flight took place on tuesday night with a @entity2 @entity100 @entity99 providing fuel for a f - 15 fighter jet operated by @entity17 and an @entity103 flown by the @entity104 , spokesman colonel @entity96 said			1
@entity3 's supreme leader @entity105 has warned that last week 's framework accord with world powers was no guarantee of a final nuclear deal			1
and president @entity110 said separately that the @entity112 republic would not sign any final agreement unless ' all economic sanctions are totally lifted on the same day '			0
' what has been done so far does not guarantee an agreement , nor its contents , nor even that the negotiations will continue to the end , ' said @entity105 , who has the final word on all matters of state			0
after a week of gruelling last - ditch negotiations , @entity12 and the six powers agreed on april 2 on the framework of a deal to be finalised by the end of june reining in @entity3 's nuclear programme in return for the lifting of international sanctions			1
' everything is in the detail , it may be that the other side , which is unfair , wants to limit our country in the details , ' @entity105 said , in his first comments on the deal			0
@entity3 's supreme leader @entity105 has warned that last week 's framework accord with world powers was no guarantee of a final nuclear deal playing down expectations of a deal after the interim accord - which sparked celebrations in the streets of @entity3 cities - @entity105 said he had not taken any position until now as ' there is nothing to take a stance on '			1
' officials say that nothing has been done yet and there is nothing binding			0
i am neither for nor against			0
' under the outline text agreed in the @entity160 city of @entity161 between @entity12 and the so - called p5 +1 powers - the @entity2 , @entity163 , @entity164 , @entity165 and @entity166 plus @entity167 - @entity3 must significantly reduce its number of centrifuges in exchange for a suspension of sanctions			1
the outline was a major breakthrough in a 12 - year international crisis over @entity3 's nuclear programme			1
' i have always supported and still support the @entity3 negotiating team , ' @entity105 said			2
' i welcome any agreement that protects the interests and greatness of the nation , but having no agreement is more honourable than an agreement in which the interests and greatness of the nation is damaged			0
' @entity3 president @entity110 said the @entity112 republic would not sign any final agreement unless ' all economic sanctions are totally lifted on the same day ' he said that retaining a civil nuclear industry in any agreement was vital for @entity3 's future development			1
' the nuclear industry is a necessity , for energy production , for desalination , and in the fields of medicine , agriculture and other sectors , ' he said			0
in a potential obstacle to any final deal , @entity110 said his country wanted sanctions lifted on the day of the implementation of any agreement			0
' we will not sign any agreements unless on the first day of the implementation of the deal all economic sanctions are totally lifted on the same day , ' he said			0
the pace at which the sanctions will be lifted is one of the outstanding issues that still has to be agreed in the final accord			0
@entity217 governments , which have imposed their own sanctions over and above those adopted by the @entity220 , have been pushing for it to happen only gradually			0
' in return for @entity3 's future cooperation , we and our international partners will provide relief in phases from the sanctions that have impacted @entity3 's economy , ' @entity2 secretary of state @entity6 said last week			1
@entity110 , who was speaking on @entity3 's @entity230 , reiterated that his government remained determined to develop its civil nuclear programme			1

the official had no information on casualties among the forces loyal to @entity252 , who has been accused of joining with the @entity250 after being ousted from power in 2012 after an @entity258 - inspired uprising			2
