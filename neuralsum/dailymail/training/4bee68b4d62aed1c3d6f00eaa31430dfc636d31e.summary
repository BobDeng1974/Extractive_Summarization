there have been some memorable winners in the 58 renewals of the @entity3 but few have sparked the raucous and heartfelt emotion that flooded through the @entity8 winner ’s enclosure after @entity10 ’s win			1
focus of the adulation was trainer @entity13 , who must have feared his days in the spotlight were history			2
it is 50 years since the great @entity17 landed the first of his two wins in this prestigious steeplechase			0
many clouds ( right ) ridden by @entity22 won the @entity3 at @entity8 many clouds ( left ) beats @entity24 ( right ) over the line at @entity8 you do n’t have to delve that far back for the @entity28 glory days but , until a revival was reignited in the last two years , memories of @entity28 big - race stars like @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity32 , his previous @entity3 winner in 1990 , were beginning to gather dust			1
rising stars like @entity39 and deputy @entity40 have injected fresh optimism into the @entity28 set - up and many clouds , brought down when still going well at last season ’s @entity44 , had suggested a big prize was within his scope			0
it all came together as the 8 - 1 shot , with jockey @entity22 in the colours of owner @entity52 , collared gallant top weight @entity53 at the last and forged three and a quarter lengths clear			1
a length back in third was @entity58 as the @entity59 remained one of the few prizes to elude champion jockey @entity62			0
well - backed @entity64 - trained 5 - 1 favourite @entity63 faded from two fences out to finish eighth and @entity22 later picked up a seven - day ban and £ 1,800 fine for excessive use of his whip			1
an emotional @entity13 said : ‘ there have been a few bare patches in the last 10 years			2
when things go bad you doubt yourself and wonder whether you are doing things right			0
‘ but i remember @entity75 telling me years ago if you have been successful what you have been doing do n’t change it			0
’ many @entity42 ( right ) jumps over the last fence before heading to victory in the @entity3 having had a hard race , @entity13 said many clouds might not run again until the @entity82 in march , for which sponsors @entity84 make him a 14 - 1 shot			1
to complete a good afternoon for the @entity87 , @entity13 ’s nephew @entity86 landed the @entity88 on @entity90 - trained @entity89			0
@entity90 - trained @entity91 never threatened in the @entity3 but @entity90 could still reflect on the day with satisfaction as @entity94 - ridden @entity93 won the @entity95 at @entity96 , the 100th grade one success of his training career .			2
