the preserved shell of a glyptodont which was unearthed by an amateur paleontologist near @entity3 , in central @entity4 near the town of @entity3 , in central @entity4 , children play in a river beside the shell of an ancient glyptodont which sticks out of the ground nearby			1
the earth around the tiny settlement is so rich with fossils that they have begun unearthing themselves after wind and rain eroded soil in the area			1
around 70 archaeological sites have been identified so far , but with little government funding it has been left up to university teams and amateurs to ensure the treasures are preserved			1
among the fossilised remains are the bones of mastodons - the ancestors of modern - day elephants - glyptodonts - a huge relative of the armadillo - and giant sloths			2
@entity33 , an it teacher from a nearby primary school , has been extracting the remains , storing them in newspaper , then sticking them back together with glue			1
despite having no experience in paleontology , he has managed to gather enough fossils together to found a museum , helped by a grant from the local tourist board			2
among his collection are teeth , bones , jaws and small invertebrates that he has unearthed			2
the area around @entity3 is just one of the many sites in the @entity56 province of @entity4 where bones have been discovered			1
@entity57 , a researcher , says the province could be home to ' one of the biggest fossil deposits in @entity62 , by the extent of the area and the variety of species that have been found			0
' @entity66 , the ancestors of modern armadillos , were huge animals that lived around 10,000 years ago remains discovered stretch from the @entity72 of the @entity74 era , which began about 65 million years ago , to the last ice age roughly 12,000 years ago			0
digging his fingers into the ground around two miles outside of @entity3 , mr @entity57 quickly begins pulling teeth out of the earth			2
' this one is a molar and appears to be from a baby mastodon			0
this other tooth seems to be from a different animal , what could it be ? ' he asks			0
fossils are often unearthed by children playing in the area who take them without realising their importance , or by poor locals who attempt to sell them			1
in nearby @entity94 , researchers found 460 trails containing more than 6,000 dinosaur footprints			0
the area around @entity3 is now thought to contain one of the larges treasure - troves of preserved animal bones anywhere in the world - including fossilised mastodon remains ( pictured ) mastodons are related to the modern - day elephant and lived around the time of the last ice age many of the prints date from the @entity109 period of the the paleozoic era , which took place around 145 and 65 million years ago			1
scientists attempted to have the find declared as a @entity114 , but the request was declined due to a lack of planning around preservation			0
however , as media attention on the areas intensifies , the politicians are beginning to understand the importance of the finds , and are working to preserve them			0
@entity124 , the secretary of culture and tourism for @entity56 , said : ' we need to implement policies for the preservation and promotion of these issues in the municipalities , the departmental government and the central government			0
' the soil around the small village is so rich with bones that many have been unearthed by wind erosion and recent rains , with 70 sites identified so far			1
