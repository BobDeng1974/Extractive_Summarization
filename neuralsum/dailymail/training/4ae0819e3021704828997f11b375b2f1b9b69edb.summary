by @entity0 face for radio : @entity2 , as @entity3 in @entity4 , has been axed from @entity5 loudmouth @entity2 ’s bid to launch a tv career has taken a major blow after @entity5 axed his show , privately declaring that ‘ he just does n’t work on screen ’			1
since being dumped by @entity13 ’s breakfast show , @entity2 , 39 , has made tv stardom his goal , even shedding over 5st to be more appealing to hd cameras			1
the @entity18 has also cut ties with his loyal agent of ten years , @entity20 , to sign with @entity21 , the agency that represents prime - time stars @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26			2
however , @entity5 bosses have decided @entity2 ’s @entity28 , which ran for six series between 2008 and 2012 , will not return			1
and they do not want to work with the @entity18 on another project			2
meanwhile , @entity32 dating show , @entity33 , which he hosts with former @entity36 contestant @entity35 , is also unlikely to be back			1
my @entity5 insider explains : ‘ we tried with @entity2			1
but the reality is he just does n’t work on screen			2
' viewers never took to him			0
the problem was n’t with the @entity28 format , it was with @entity2 himself			1
’ @entity2 had hoped to make another series of @entity28 following his stint as @entity3 in @entity49 ’s touring production of @entity4			1
but it is now back to the drawing board			0
a source close to him tells me : ‘ he ’s in @entity54 working on new projects			0
@entity5 was never the be all and end all to his future on tv			1
he ’s very confident of having big news soon			0
’ angering @entity60 : @entity2 refused to take on anew role at the @entity60 after he was replaced as a presenter for @entity13 however , @entity2 has infuriated executives at the @entity60 since they replaced him on @entity13 ’s breakfast show with @entity65 because he was considered too old for the youth station			1
he ’s been taken off the @entity60 payroll after he refused to consider a new role , despite being on a £ 1 million , two - year contract until 2014			0
high demands : @entity71 may return to the @entity36 if the price is right when @entity71 quit @entity36 five years ago it was in a row over her salary as she demanded a £ 500,000 pay increase which would see her earn more than £ 2 million a year			0
now i hear money could again cause problems as @entity80 prepares to bring her back to the panel for the @entity85 talent show ’s tenth anniversary			1
@entity71 , whose strained marriage to @entity87 hit the headlines again this week , has existing work commitments in the @entity54 , where she is a panellist on daily show @entity91			1
my @entity93 source reveals : ‘ @entity71 wants a lot of money either to commmute from @entity96 to @entity97 every week or take a leave of absence from the talk			0
’ but her stance is causing massive issues for producers as existing judge @entity104 is also so far refusing to sign , suggesting her music career might be her priority this year			0
my show source adds : ‘ we ’re unsure if this is a ploy for @entity104 to also get a pay increase			1
’ last year ’s judge @entity110 has not been officially told if her services are required because she is viewed as a ‘ back - up option ’			0
@entity114 shadow dancers attraction — who stole the show on saturday ’s @entity117 ’s @entity116 — are accused of being copycats			1
attraction is fast becoming the most popular act with bookies since @entity122 in 2009			0
however , my sources on @entity124 claim their routine is very similar to @entity126 , a dance troupe on the @entity54 show in 2011			2
the @entity54 version featured the outlines of @entity54 landmarks			0
same shadows : @entity114 dance troupe attraction , who appeared on @entity117 's @entity116 on saturday , have been caused of being a copycat act ‘ attraction was presented as being unique , but one search on @entity138 makes it obvious that this was a concept pioneered by someone else , ’ says my source			2
a @entity117 ’s @entity116 source confirmed : ‘ we do n’t deny attraction are a similar act to @entity126			0
but that could n’t stop them auditioning			0
’ @entity85 has had 15 complaints about @entity148 being from @entity114 , given the show is @entity117 ’s @entity116 , while there have been fewer than ten each about the sexually provocative lyrics in 11 - year - old @entity153 ’s performance of @entity154 and @entity156 ’s erotic dance			2
hotly tipped magician @entity157 had to get permission from the government before signing with @entity5 for his first major tv series			1
before launching a tv career , the 30 - year - old , who is described as a ‘ world - class sleight - of - hand artist ’ , was recruited by intelligence agencies to work with the military as a consultant on deception skills			0
he tells me : ‘ i ca n’t say who exactly i work for , but they were initially concerned about me doing the show			2
we came to an agreement that i would n’t use any of the specific tactics that i use during my sessions with the military on the show			2
’ his series , @entity178 , begins next friday .			0
