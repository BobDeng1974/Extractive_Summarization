by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 published : 18:50 est , 6 november 2013 updated : 20:16 est , 6 november 2013 ministers have been accused of sacrificing centuries of @entity6 shipbuilding to placate @entity8 voters before next year ’s independence referendum			2
the @entity10 announced yesterday that warship construction will end at @entity12 – home of the @entity14 since the days of the @entity15 and sir @entity16 – in order to save shipyards on the @entity19			1
defence giant @entity20 announced that it was cutting 1,775 jobs			1
some 940 shipyard workers – along with 170 agency workers – will be laid off in @entity12 , where ships will undergo maintenance			1
job cuts : the @entity10 has announced that warships will no longer be manufactured in @entity12 dockyard , pictured @entity30 ships are seen docked at the @entity31 in @entity12 dockyard , the @entity12 home of @entity20 end of an era : warships will no longer be built at @entity12 pictured - an announcement that has seen ministers accused of trying to placate @entity8 voters ahead of next year 's independence referendum job losses : another 835 jobs will be lost at yards in @entity40 ( pictured ) and @entity41 on the @entity19 in @entity42 , at @entity43 in @entity44 and at the firm ¿ s @entity47 office near @entity48 another 835 jobs will be lost at yards in @entity40 and @entity41 on the @entity19 in @entity42 , at @entity43 in @entity44 and at the firm ’s @entity47 office near @entity48			1
however , the @entity19 yards won a contract for three offshore patrol vessels to keep them active until the building of a new generation of @entity58 frigates			1
@entity60 ’s official spokesman claimed the @entity12 dockyard was losing out ‘ in the @entity63 national interest ’ and repeatedly failed to deny that the decision to prop up the @entity8 yards was influenced by the referendum			1
in a clear signal that @entity8 political considerations were part of the equation , defence secretary @entity67 made it clear that the frigates contract would be stripped from @entity8 if voters chose to leave the @entity63			1
‘ the @entity63 has not – except during the two world wars – ever placed orders for complex warships outside the @entity63 , and i do n’t anticipate that the @entity63 would wish to do that in the future , ’ he said			2
‘ i think there ’s something there that people in @entity8 need to think about very carefully			2
’ but critics warned that the closure of @entity12 would rob @entity6 of its expertise to build the new frigates if there was a @entity90 vote in @entity8			1
going home : shipworkers leave the @entity93 at @entity40 on the @entity19 in @entity42 tonight still going : the @entity19 yards won a contract for three offshore patrol vessels to keep them active until the building of a new generation of @entity58 frigates threat : in a clear signal that @entity8 political considerations were part of the equation , defence secretary @entity67 made it clear that the frigates contract would be stripped from @entity8 if voters chose to leave the @entity63 @entity108 , @entity109 mp for @entity110 , said : ‘ @entity8 jobs have been protected at the expense of those on the @entity114			1
’ @entity20 and the @entity10 said the cuts were necessary because shipbuilding work was declining as the construction of two aircraft carriers neared completion			1
@entity60 was consulted , but the issue was not discussed in full at the @entity121 , where strategic decisions are supposed to be taken			0
speaking out : the decision on where the @entity58 frigates will be built will not be made until the end of next year , after the @entity8 referendum in september , but @entity128 , the @entity129 mp for @entity130 , pictured , said that could be too late to plug the gap between the completion of the aircraft carriers in 2015 , the @entity10 said it would commission three offshore patrol vessels to play ‘ a key role in counter-terrorism , counter-piracy and anti-smuggling operations ’			1
work on the vessels is due to begin next year in @entity8 , with the first ship being delivered to the @entity14 in 2017			2
shortly after 10am yesterday , workers in @entity12 were told to attend a meeting with @entity20 bosses who told them they could apply for voluntary redundancy , retrain or be redeployed to @entity40			1
@entity148 , 33 , the father of four daughters under 10 , has worked at the yard for 17 years			0
‘ it ’s definitely a political decision , ’ he said			0
they do n’t care about us			0
’ shipbuilder @entity155 , 45 , from @entity157 , @entity158 , said : ‘ the mood in the room was sour and bitter			0
they have kept us in the dark for so long and now , just before @entity164 , they ’ve told us we are going to lose out jobs			0
’ the decision on where the @entity58 frigates will be built will not be made until the end of next year , after the @entity8 referendum in september , but @entity128 , the @entity129 mp for @entity130 , said that could be too late			2
‘ five hundred years of tradition is going to be swept away , ’ he said			0
‘ if the referendum went against the @entity63 government then it would be very hard to replace what we ’ve taken apart in @entity12			1
it ’s a very foolish government that puts all its eggs into one basket			0
’ for more than 800 years , @entity12 ’s proud shipbuilding tradition has played a key role in @entity63 being a major naval power			1
in 1194 , @entity183 – @entity184 – built the first dock			0
under @entity187 , it grew as a naval base and the world ’s first dry dock was constructed there in 1495			0
his son , @entity191 – regarded as the founder of the modern navy – added at least 85 ships to the fleet and made @entity12 its main base			1
work on his flagship the @entity15 began in 1509 and she was later refitted to become the first @entity63 warship to have a complete lower deck of guns with hinged ports			2
ruling the waves : a battleship for the @entity14 is launched at @entity12 in 1899 in the 18th century , the dockyard , with its engineering and armament yards , was the largest industrial complex in the world			1
the first iron - hulled warship , @entity210 , was built in 1860 , ushering in a new wave of shipbuilding			2
the revolutionary @entity213 , launched in 1905 by @entity214 , gave its name to a new type of battleship			0
during the @entity219 , 1,658 ships were docked for refit or repair in @entity12 as personnel numbers rose to 23,000 and for the first time women were employed at the yard			1
after the war , construction continued but was limited to cruisers and smaller ships			2
by 1937 , numbers had declined to 15,000			0
some 2,550 ships were docked at @entity12 during the @entity231 , but the yard suffered major bomb damage and the @entity14 ’s larger ships were moved to ports further north			1
numbers employed rose to a record 27,000			0
after the war , @entity12 built only destroyers and frigates			2
the 2,860 - ton frigate @entity241 , completed in 1967 , was the last of nearly 300 ships entirely built at the dockyard			0
the renaissance of shipbuilding came in 2006 with the launch of the £ 80million , 1,300 - ton offshore patrol vessel , @entity249			1
the dockyards were bought by @entity20 in 2009 and projects included building a 7,000 - ton midship section , 5,000 - ton stern section and control towers for aircraft carriers @entity256 and @entity257			2
the @entity259 attraction is home to @entity261 , in which @entity262 set sail from the city before the battle of @entity266 in 1805 , @entity210 and the @entity15			0
she sank in the @entity268 in 1545 as she led an attack on the @entity271 fleet			0
the wreck was salvaged in 1982 and finally went on display last may			0
labour defence spokesman @entity274 said : ‘ @entity63 must retain a sovereign ship - building capability			2
none of us want to see @entity8 leave the @entity63 , but we need clarity from the government about what safeguards are in place to meet all eventualities after next year ’s referendum			0
’ @entity285 , leader of @entity286 , said : ‘ i condemn the decision to shut down the last remaining shipyard in @entity6 with the capability to build advanced surface warships			0
‘ this decision is bad for @entity12 , with the loss of many highly skilled jobs , but it ’s also bad for the defence of the @entity63 and for the @entity14			1
’ @entity8 have developed a ‘ sense of victimhood ’ after the collapse of their heavy industries , one of the country ’s most senior judges said yesterday			0
in a lecture at @entity305 , @entity303 judge @entity302 said the push for independence was a result of the failure of @entity8 ’s steel , shipbuilding and heavy engineering industries and the state takeover of its economy .			0
