by @entity0 published : 09:27 est , 16 may 2013 updated : 19:32 est , 16 may 2013 when @entity2 revealed that she had had a double mastectomy to lessen her chances of developing the cancer that killed her mother , she was praised across the world for her courage			1
but in some corners of the internet , her announcement was greeted only with cruelty			1
trolls branded her a ‘ drama queen ’ and an ‘ attention seeker ’ , with some suggesting her decision was a publicity stunt and others making crude jokes about her breasts			1
miss @entity2 , 37 , revealed she had had the surgery in an article for the @entity23 , explaining she was making her decision public in the hope it would raise awareness and help other women			1
@entity2 , left , went public with her decision to have a preventative double mastectomy , and was lambasted for doing so by @entity30 columnist @entity29 , right her mother died of cancer at 56 , and miss @entity2 said she had had her breasts removed to reassure her six children that the same would n’t happen to her			1
tests revealed she had a faulty gene which gave her an 87 per cent chance of developing breast cancer			1
having a mastectomy has reduced that to 5 per cent			2
she underwent three months of treatment , which ended with reconstructive surgery last month			2
while campaigners and charities praised her decision to go public , @entity42 users soon began making vile jokes			1

( asking for a friend )			2
’ and columnist @entity65 wrote a scathing piece on the @entity30 website , saying it was ‘ expected ’ for celebrities to talk about their health			1
he said : ‘ the praise being heaped on ms @entity2 , not for having surgery but for talking about it , overlooks the fact that it is now de rigueur for celebrities to talk openly about their ailments			2
‘ from @entity76 having her cancer diagnosed on @entity79 tv to @entity80 doing interviews about her bipolar disorder to @entity83 writing about his depression … in both the tabloid and high - brow sections of the celebrity world , talking about being sick is not only increasingly acceptable – it ’s expected			1
’ last night campaigners said that those responsible for making abusive comments were ‘ an absolute disgrace ’			1
@entity92 , founder of the @entity93 , said : ‘ it is such a shame that someone who has put together such a wonderful piece should have to suffer anything from idiots like that			2
' i think they are an absolute disgrace			0
they are idiotic and puerile			0
' they should n’t be allowed to be on these social networking sites			0
’ she added : ‘ i really applaud her for doing it , it ’s raising the profile that nobody like myself or anybody else could do			0
' people will probably not be so scared , [ they will ] pick up the phone and be screened			0
‘ it is a very personal decision and one that would n’t have been taken lightly			0
‘ she did it to help save lives			0
’ miss @entity2 is now expected to have a hysterectomy and an oophorectomy , in which the ovaries are removed			0
her fiancé , @entity55 , said : ‘ having witnessed this decision first hand , i find @entity126 ’s choice , as well as so many others like her , absolutely heroic			0
