@entity9 , 36 , and her 45 - year - old former husband @entity10 , worked together running their ‘ niche ’ dentistry business and are believed to have had assets worth up to £ 10million			2
they raised two children together as their empire of 12 practices spread across @entity19 and the @entity20			0
when the couple divorced last year , mrs @entity9 took ownership of seven of them , which upset him and mr @entity27 's ‘ strong - willed ’ mother @entity27			1
divorce battle : dr @entity9 has won a @entity5 wrangle after an ' acrimonious divorce ' battle with her ex-husband @entity10 , right , and his ' controlling ' mother but mr @entity27 insisted that five of those surgeries belonged to them , but the @entity5 today said they did not agree			1
@entity9 's barrister , @entity36 , told the court about the deep rift between her and her mother - in - law at the heart of the expensive court battle			1
' at the heart of the case , lay a strong mutual antipathy between two very strong - willed women , the husband 's mother @entity42 and the wife , ' he said			1
' @entity42 had been the driving force of the @entity27 family businesses and she held a dominant and highly controlling position within the @entity27 family ... she expected deference from her family , which she regarded as her due , both as a mother and one of the founders of the family fortune			2
' @entity61 , for @entity42 and her sons , confirmed that @entity9 was ' a daughter - in - law for whom she had no warm feelings			1
' family breakdown : the @entity5 heard that at the heart of the legal row was ' strong mutual antipathy ' between @entity9 and her mother - in - law @entity27 today judges sided with the younger party and handed her victory			1
mr @entity74 said the business had depended on her dentistry expertise and her husband ’s family had invested no capital and ' no more than minimal effort ' in the venture			0
decision : the judge ruled @entity9 should keep seven of the practices because the other side made ' no more than minimal effort ' in the venture the case hinged on what was said at a 2007 family meeting at which it was agreed to set up a company - @entity91 ( @entity92 ) - of which @entity9 would be sole director			2
the shares in the company were to split in quarters between @entity9 , @entity42 , @entity10 and his brother , @entity96			0
over the next few years , @entity9 was enormously successful in building the business , buying or setting up a string of practices on behalf of the company			2
however , she also took on five surgeries herself and they were the focus of the family mud - slinging in court			0
@entity9 said she had started her own ' parallel ' company , alongside @entity92 , to escape ' interference ' in her commercial affairs by her ' dominant and highly controlling mother - in - law '			1
however , @entity42 and her sons insisted she had violated her duty as a director by going it alone instead of working for the benefit of @entity92			0
as 75 per cent shareholders , they said they were entitled to the lion ’s share of the five practices			0
however , dismissing their appeal , mr @entity74 said it had been agreed at the meeting that @entity9 would ' run the company as she saw fit '			0
observing that the whole set - up was ' extraordinarily favourable ' to @entity42 and her sons , he added : ' they were receiving 75 % of the shares of a potentially valuable company in which they were investing neither capital nor more than minimal effort '			0
anushika not only had clinical control over the business , but also responsbility for its day - to - day management , and her view that “ she did not need @entity42 ’s permission ” to acquire new surgeries for herself was “ perfectly understandable ”			0
he concluded that @entity42 and her sons had ' with full knowledge of the material facts , acquiesced in an arrangement whereby @entity9 would be free to acquire some dental practices for the company and others for herself ' .			2

feud centred on dr @entity9 and her mother - in - law @entity27
after @entity148 divorced @entity149 she **claimed** seven dentist practices
' strong - willed ' mother - in - law and her son **claimed** ownership of five of those
judge today ruled in daughter - in - law 's favour at the @entity5
