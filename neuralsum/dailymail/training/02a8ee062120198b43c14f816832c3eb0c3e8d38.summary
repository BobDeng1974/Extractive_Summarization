the council have confirmed that he was not at the meeting and is currently absent from work - but they did not explain why			1
however , one parent at the 400 - pupil school , who asked not to be named , said they have been told he is off sick			1
they said : ' the meeting was a farce and now we have been told the headteacher is off sick			1
someone needs to step in to sort this mess out			2
' @entity41 used to be an excellent school , but parents do n't know what 's happening			1
' another angry parent said : ' the damage has already been done			2
' it is not clear whether anyone else was present to represent the headteacher			2
the parent petition handed to governors read : ' we believe that the school is failing to provide suitably - qualified staff to cover lessons during long - term staff absences , which leads to a lack of consistence and rigour in the standard of teaching and learning			1
' it also causes a lack of progress in pupils ' learning			0
' we are also concerned about the number of experienced staff who have recently left @entity41 , sometimes at short notice			2
' the petition went on to say : ' pupils regularly complain that they have not had a formal lesson and / or that lessons are poorly planned with a lack of continuity and progression			2
' pupils also regularly complain of being taught by classroom assistants , who are there to support the qualified teachers , not to shoulder the responsibility of delivering the lesson , parents began the petition following concerns over high levels of staff absence and teaching standards at the @entity16 y @entity90 ( pictured ) ' this is unfair on the classroom assistant and unfair on the pupils			1

' dear @entity142 following a petition received from parents / guardians , a meeting between the school governors and parents will be held on : wednesday , 19 march , 2014 at 7.00pm in the school hall			1
the agenda of the meeting will be to discuss the two following points only : 1			2
staff absenteeism and staff turnover			1
we believe the high levels of staff absenteeism in @entity156 are having a detrimental impact on pupils ' progress and achievement in their studies			1
we believe that the school is failing to provide consistance ( sic ) and rigour in the standard of teaching and learning			0
it also causes a lack of progress in pupils ' learning			0
this is particular concern in the case of core subjects such as science and maths , but also in subjects such as music			0
" we are also concerned about the number of experienced staff who have recently left @entity41 , sometimes at short notice			0
this was evident in the case of history where a member of staff left abruptly during the summer , which consequently meant a whole term of gcse syllabus was delivered by a retired supply teacher			0
this adds weight to the strong anecdotal evidence to suggest there is a culture of overbearing management in the school , causing a serious issue with staff morale			2
monitoring of standards in teaching and learning			0
we are concerned about the standards in teaching and learning in some subjects			0
pupils regularly complain that they have not had a formal lesson and / or that lessons are poorly planned , with a lack of continuity and progression			0
pupils also regularly complain of being taught by classroom assistants , who are there to support qualified teachers ; not to shoulder the responsibility of delivering the lesson			0
this is unfair on the classroom assistant and unfair on the pupils			0
in accordance with guidance no matters other than those raised in the petition can be discussed			0
note also that discussion that may refer to individual members of staff , parents or pupils will not be allowed			2
i look forward to a beneficial and positive meeting			0
yours sincerely , @entity236 - chairman			0
