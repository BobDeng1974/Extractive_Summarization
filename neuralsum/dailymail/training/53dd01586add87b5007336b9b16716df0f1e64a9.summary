by @entity0 @entity1 called on @entity2 to be ‘ more evangelical ’ about their faith last night as he admitted he has felt the ‘ healing power ’ of the @entity4			1
in an @entity8 article for the @entity9 , the prime minister said @entity2 should be ‘ more confident ’ in talking up their beliefs			1
blending his faith and his pet political project the @entity13 , mr @entity1 asked @entity2 to volunteer and ‘ get out there and make a difference to people ’s lives ’			2
prime minister @entity1 , pictured speaking at the @entity18 in central @entity19 earlier this month , has said @entity20 should be ' more confident about our status as a @entity2 nation ' the prime minister insisted that being a @entity2 country did not mean ' doing down ' other religions or ' passing judgment ' on those with no faith at all			1
it comes after the government came under attack from senior clergy over its welfare reforms , but mr @entity1 has responded by saying ' we all believe in many of the same principles ' and that churches were ' vital partners '			1
mr @entity1 described himself as a ' classic ' member of the @entity4 , ' not that regular in attendance , and a bit vague on some of the more difficult parts of the faith '			0
and he rejected the idea that in an ' ever more secular age ' people should not talk about their religion			0
in his most robust words to date on the importance of religion in politics he said he wants to ‘ infuse politics ’ with @entity2 ‘ ideals and values ’ such as ‘ hard work , charity , compassion , humility and love ’			2
' i believe we should be more confident about our status as a @entity2 country , more ambitious about expanding the role of faith - based organisations , and , frankly , more evangelical about a faith that compels us to get out there and make a difference to people 's lives , ' he said			1
' first , being more confident about our status as a @entity2 country does not somehow involve doing down other faiths or passing judgment on those with no faith at all			1
' @entity1 has said @entity20 being ' more confident ' about its status as a @entity2 country should not involve ' doing down ' other faiths			1
he is pictured in @entity79 , @entity80 , during a summer holiday with wife @entity82 in august 2013 mr @entity1 said he had ' felt at first hand the healing power of the @entity4 's pastoral care ' and @entity2 ' know how powerful faith can be in the toughest of times ' – comments that perhaps refer to the period when his eldest son @entity89 died			1
earlier this year the government came under attack from 27 @entity4 bishops who warned that thousands of people were being forced to rely on hand - outs from food banks as a result of the coalition 's benefit changes			0
the leader of the @entity101 cardinal @entity100 has also said it was a ' disgrace ' that in such a wealthy country there were people who could not afford to feed themselves			0
' many people tell me it is easier to be @entity109 or @entity110 in @entity20 than in a secular country precisely because the tolerance that @entity2 demands of our society provides greater space for other religious faiths , too			1
' crucially , the christian values of responsibility , hard work , charity , compassion , humility , and love are shared by people of every faith and none - and we should be confident in standing up to defend them			0
@entity130 church , pictured to the left , in @entity19 where @entity1 goes for @entity132 ' people who , instead , advocate some sort of secular neutrality fail to grasp the consequences of that neutrality , or the role that faith can play in helping people to have a moral code			0
of course , faith is neither necessary nor sufficient for morality			0
' many atheists and agnostics live by a moral code - and there are @entity2 who do n't			2
but for people who do have a faith , that faith can be a guide or a helpful prod in the right direction - and , whether inspired by faith or not , that direction or moral code matters			0
' mr @entity1 acknowledged that welfare was ' controversial ' but said ' not enough is made of our efforts to tackle poverty ' the prime minister , who has faced criticism from within his own party over the government 's commitment to spend 0.7 per cent of gross national income on overseas aid , said the policy should be a ' source of national pride '			2
the article is the latest demonstration of mr @entity1 's religious faith			0
at an @entity8 reception in @entity175 earlier this month he told an audience of @entity2 leaders and politicians in @entity175 that his ' moments of greatest peace ' occurred every other thursday morning attending the eucharist at @entity182 , the west @entity19 church linked to the school his children attend			2
' i find a little bit of peace and hopefully a bit of guidance , ' he added .			0
