by @entity0 a mother and grandmother of two died in agony seven months after a stand - in consultant operated on her in the wrong place , causing huge blood loss and brain damage			1
@entity8 , 71 , suffered a massive haemorrhage after mistakes by @entity11 , during a routine gall bladder procedure at the @entity13 , resulted in three holes in a major artery			1
theatre staff assisting the surgeon became so concerned after he spent two hours ' operating in completely the wrong place ' that they called in a senior surgeon to come and finish the procedure , according to a report by the @entity23			1
he completed the operation , removing 90 per cent of mrs @entity8 's gall bladder , but the report said that errors made by mr @entity11 , who had only been at the hospital for two weeks , had already caused huge blood loss , resulting in damage to mrs @entity8 's brain			1
tragedy : @entity8 , 71 , died after a botched routine gall bladder operation at @entity13 mrs @entity8 's condition deteriorated significantly after the operation at @entity13 in may 2012 , and she died in december 2012 after months of agony			1
a letter sent from the trust to mrs @entity8 ’s family following an official investigation stated that mr @entity11 ' should not have been anywhere near this artery			1
he was operating in completely the wrong place '			0
the grandmother of two 's family criticised the hospital for failures relating to her care , including a lack of ‘ robust ’ supervision to determine mr @entity11 ’s skills as a surgeon			1
daughter @entity53 , 40 , said : ' he ’d only been at the hospital for two weeks , with limited checks regarding his capability as a consultant			1
' because of the hospital ’s failure to assess his ability , my mum died			2
' at an inquest held earlier this month into mrs @entity8 ’s death , @entity13 coroner @entity62 returned a narrative verdict			2
she said the medical evidence was that the dissection during the initial stages of the gall bladder operation was inappropriate and led to a massive secondary haemorrhage			0
' this in turn led to mrs @entity8 suffering problems after her surgery , the injury to her brain and ultimately her death on december 20 , 2012 at the @entity78 , ' added mrs @entity62			2
mrs @entity8 was otherwise fit and healthy when she went into @entity13 for the operation the cause of death was given as sepsis , catheter - related urinary tract infection , cirrhosis and complications following the gall bladder operation , including lack of oxygen to the brain			1
the case prompted the coroner to write to the @entity92 calling managers to take steps to prevent similar tragedies happening in future			0
mrs @entity62 wrote : ' @entity97 revealed that the systems in place for signing off a locum consultant as competent to undertake independent practice were not as robust as they should have been			0
' she said the trust had now changed both its recruitment process and the processes for signing off a locum consultant as competent , but said some other hospital trusts still had less stringent practices			0
the coroner added : ' accordingly , there is a real risk that what happened in this case could happen elsewhere			0
' there is a real risk that what happened in this case could happen elsewhere - action should be taken to prevent future deaths ' @entity62 , @entity13 coroner , in a letter to the @entity92 ' in my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths , and i believe your organisation has the power to take such action			2
' @entity53 claimed the infirmary had failed her mother in numerous aspects of her care and left her ' in a mess ' until the day she died			0
she said : ' the hospital failed to diagnose problems , failed to give her treatment , left her waiting for more than 10 hours in a wheelchair , soaked in bile and refused her pain medication			0
' we ’ve been given a letter of apology , but i ’m shocked that these failures could happen in a modern hospital			0
' in a statement apologising to the family , dr @entity142 , medical director of @entity13 ’s hospitals , said : ' on behalf of the members of staff who were involved in mrs @entity8 ’s care , i offer my heartfelt apologies and deepest condolences			2
' since the events of last year , we have changed our vetting process for locum surgeons to ensure that they are capable of operating to the same high standard as the surgeons we employ directly			0
' the trust confirmed that mr @entity11 had his contract terminated and was reported to the @entity159 , which has imposed temporary restrictions on his licence to practice while further investigations are carried out			0
as a result , mr @entity11 , who is now believed to be working as a locum surgeon elsewhere , must be supervised when performing laparoscopic surgery , and is not allowed to practise privately .			1
