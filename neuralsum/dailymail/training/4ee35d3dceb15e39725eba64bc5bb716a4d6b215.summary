by @entity0 published : 05:23 est , 20 april 2012 updated : 07:08 est , 20 april 2012 manipulative : @entity2 , 59 , created a fantasy world in an elaborate plot to have sex with the youngster a woman seduced a vulnerable young girl by writing hundreds of letters to her from fictional characters , including one from a ghost called @entity12			1
@entity2 , 59 , created a fantasy world in an elaborate plot to have sex with the girl , who was aged 16 at the time			1
@entity2 , had denied four sex assault charges , but was convicted by a jury and was sentenced to six years in prison			1
the judge said the case was bizarre and told her : ' you behaved in a wicked way towards this vulnerable girl - just to satisfy your own sexual gratification			1
' @entity28 , prosecuting at @entity29 in @entity30 , said that some of the attacks happened at a holiday camp and a swimming pool			0
she said @entity2 , from @entity36 , bombarded the girl , with more than 170 letters from fictitious people - including soldiers , a character called @entity41 and a ghost called @entity12			1
ms @entity28 added : ' the girl needed love and support			2
@entity2 knew that and knew that she was vulnerable and was an easy target			1
' instead of mollycoddling , showing her love and support , she undid this girl ’s bra			2
' she had a sexual interest in this girl and manipulated her as it was easy to do			2
' obsession : @entity2 , from @entity36 , bombarded the girl with more than 170 letters from fictitious people - including soldiers , a character called @entity41 and a ghost called @entity12 ( file pic ) it was then that @entity2 started to write fake letters - in an effort to manipulate her victim			1
the prosecutor added : ' she had a rather twisted and strange view of the world , encouraging an apparent correspondence with a number of males that she ( the victim ) had never met and which ( the victim ) now believes was simply invented by @entity76			0
' at the time , she believed a whole cast of characters were writing to her and creating a fantasy world			0
she said the reason was because @entity2 wanted to ensure the girl , who is now 18 , would not seek ' a real - life boyfriend who might take her away from this situation			1
' the prosecutor said : ' @entity76 created a fantasy family for this girl , letters from many characters including @entity90 and @entity91 ... and a ghost called @entity12			2
' none of these people ever materialised , never seen in person			0
we say they never existed			0
' strong words : the judge at @entity29 in @entity30 , said the case was bizarre and told her : ' you behaved in a wicked way towards this vulnerable girl - just to satisfy you own sexual gratification ' ms @entity28 added : ' @entity12 was the ghost , an invention of course , but an invention who wrote letters of his own but also passed information			1
' this was , the @entity113 say , a device to explain how the apparent author of one of the letters , who was allegedly in a hospital after having his arm blown off in @entity120 , might know of a row with @entity76 that day			0
ms @entity28 told the court that the ghost was a device to explain how the characters would know about events in the teenager 's life			0
' even letters from the ghost managed to have a sexual angle , with one saying : ‘ do n’t stop the love games			2
me love it ’ , ' she claimed			0
another letter , purporting to be from @entity91 , who was supposed to be a admirer type of figure , and read : ' do n’t show your body to anyone , ( just ) to me , @entity12 , and @entity142 and @entity76			0
' the prosecutor added : ' one can only imagine the effect that these letters , pages upon pages , had on this adolescent young girl , making it difficult for her to exercise judgment or free will			0

@entity2 had denied four sex assault charges , but was convicted by a jury and *jailed* for six years
