' to prevent such vast quantities of drugs , worth millions of pounds , from flooding the streets , is a massive achievement			0
' in one fell swoop we put a huge hole in the drugs supply market and today 's sentence reflects great team work from specialist units across the force			0
' both @entity12 and @entity17 have failed to provide any proper account or explanation for their actions and while work is ongoing to fully understand who else is might have been involved at either end - in @entity44 or @entity11 - today they have been given long prison sentences for their involvement			1
