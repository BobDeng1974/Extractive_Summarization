by dr @entity0 it 's the word that no - one wants to hear - and a diagnosis which changes your life in seconds			1
but the reality is that half of all @entity9 men and a third of women will be affected by cancer by the age of 84			1
in 2014 , more than 128,000 @entity9 are expected to be diagnosed with cancer			1
for every one of those people , there is a network of partners , friends and family who hope to support the patient as best as they can			0
at what is a confusing and overwhelming time , medical oncologist dr @entity28 's new book so it 's @entity29 : now what ? is designed to guide people through the battle of their lives			1
she uses the experiences of those who have gone through cancer to give tips and advice that may not have even occurred to the sufferer , but could make all the difference			1
here , she offers advice to patients , family and friends who are dealing with the shock of a cancer diagnosis			1
dr @entity0 has written a book to help assist cancer patients and their loved ones , right from the moment of diagnosis if you are the patient … avoid panicking although this is easier said than done			1
the very mention of cancer inspires fear but these days , many early cancers have a very good prognosis , allowing patients to lead a normal life after adequate treatment			1
for example , breast cancers detected via screening mammogram are typically small and operable			0
there is a swirling debate about prostate cancer screening because it is thought that many patients , especially older men , die with prostate cancer rather than of it			1
bowel cancer screening has led to a reduction in deaths			1
in turn , many non-malignant conditions such as severe heart failure , kidney disease or end - stage emphysema have a poorer prognosis than cancer			1
cancer survival rates continue to improve and a person diagnosed today has a better than ever chance of survival			1
sixty - five per cent of cancer patients can expect to survive for the next five years , with the survival rate having risen by an impressive thirty per cent in the past two decades			1
renew your relationship with your gp or find one			0
a cancer patient may meet several kinds of doctors including a gp , medical oncologist , surgeon and radiation oncologist			1
of these , the relationship with the first two is often the longest for many patients			1
a good gp with whom you share a rapport and understanding can be the lynchpin of your medical journey			2
he or she can refer you to capable and considerate specialists , organize tests and serve as a valuable sounding board			0
your gp , another specialist or the hospital system will usually refer you to an oncologist			2
the tips in the book hope to make cancer sufferers feel less overwhelmed when dealing with their diagnosis and treatment take time to find a suitable oncologist and take the trouble to understand your diagnosis and its implications			1
@entity29 does not develop in a single day or a week – it is typically something that grows over months			0
hence , avoid the natural instinct to seek next - day treatment , knowing that in most instances , it ’s okay and indeed , important , to order your thoughts , make a list of priorities , and find the right doctor for you			2
it is vital that you feel able to talk to your oncologist because cancer treatment is complicated but also nuanced			1
a mutual feeling of respect and understanding are important considerations as is empathy			0
it pays to heed word - of - mouth recommendations			0
it ’s also a good idea to think about what kind of doctor suits your needs			0
some patients are content with an oncologist who can give them straight medical advice and they seek emotional support elsewhere			1
other patients want their oncologist to offer more holistic care			1
some patients are quite comfortable with the oncologist making all the decisions while others prefer a collaborative approach			1
do n’t feel disadvantaged by a perceived lack of education or sophistication to engage with a specialist			0
part of a doctor ’s job is to demystify medicine and bring you along			0
this means speaking to you in a language that you can understand			0
expect plain - language and honest explanations to your questions and ask for information in writing where possible so you can read it in your own time			2
the flip side of demanding honesty is that you must be prepared for bad news from time to time , but as long as this is addressed in a helpful and considered manner , you are usually better off learning the bad news			2
dr @entity0 tells cancer patients to ask their doctor to give a written version of any information , so the patient can go home and read it again in their own time if you are the spouse or partner of a cancer patient … cancer does n’t just affect the individual but also the family			1
partners can suffer no less acutely as they try to help the patient while managing their own emotions			0
allow the patient some space to reconcile to the shock of the diagnosis			2
even people who usually share everything can become withdrawn , leading partners to feel frustrated that they are being shut out			0
from the patient ’s perspective there is the struggle to make sense of the upheaval and the obligation to shield loved ones from worry			0
if you are feeling left out , urge yourself to practice patience and understanding			0
make known that you are available but also be respectful of personal space			2
cancer patients quickly become disempowered as they enter the healthcare maze			1
everyone tells them what to do and when to do it			0
the greatest gift you can give your partner is your quiet support and a ready ear			0
dr @entity236 's new book is a guide to the fight of your life when you are a friend of a cancer patient … even though you ’re desperate to help it is n’t uncommon , especially in the early stages , to feel as if your help is not welcome or that you are being intrusive			1
sadly , many friendships fall victim to cancer because of mismatched expectations and often , the sheer practicality of trying to keep relationships alive when you are in the battle of your life			2
not everyone wants to share bad or confronting news with others			0
some patients do n’t want to be perceived as needy while others are merely protective of their friends			2
people feel ready to talk at different junctures of an illness			0
and frankly , many patients are simply too exhausted to analyse these things too much			2
something many patients have told me is that they find it tiring , and even disheartening , to be constantly asked by good friends if there is anything they can do			2
many patients prefer that their friend took stock of what they need and just did it			2
small and regular acts of kindness and consideration matter far more than a large burst of generosity followed by awkward silence			0
join a roster for preparing meals , fold the laundry , pick up a patient ’s children from school , mow the lawns – these routines do n’t stop when someone has cancer and a good friend will rearrange commitments to take care of the boring stuff			2
a potent theme for cancer patients is abandonment so do n’t underestimate the value of just being there even if you feel you are not doing anything important			1
offer to drive the patient to an appointment or simply sit next to the chemotherapy chair			0
@entity29 is typically a drawn - out experience with several ups and downs			0
with modern medicine , the future appears optimistic			0
if you are a patient take heart from this			0
if you are a concerned partner , your supportive presence could be the greatest gift			0
if you are a worried friend , recognize the value of small , seemingly insignificant acts of kindness that are anything but			0
so it ’s @entity29 : @entity319 ? by @entity0 is out today ( wednesday july 23 ) and is published by @entity320 ' so it 's cancer : now what ? ' gives a friendly , honest explanation of the every stage of the difficult process of dealing with cancer			1
