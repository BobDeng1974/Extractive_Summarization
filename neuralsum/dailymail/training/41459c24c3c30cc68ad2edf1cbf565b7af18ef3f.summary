@entity13 ’s peatland holds 3.2 trillion tonnes of carbon trapped in the soil , but will easily leach harmful gases if damaged			1
more than half of the wind farms planned for @entity19 are intended for areas of peatland , which are commonly found in rolling upland areas perfectly suited for giant turbines			1
peatland makes up just over 10 per cent of @entity25 , 20 per cent of @entity26 and 65 per cent of @entity19			2
researchers at the @entity28 have devised a method to calculate the ‘ carbon payback ’ time for wind farms on peat soil			1
it is currently used by the wind farm industry to assess the @entity37 impact of their developments			2
as turbines are mostly located in remote areas , they require miles of new roads to service them , drying out or destroying the peat below			0
@entity46 only retains carbon when it is moist , so any large - scale damage would result in huge amounts of carbon being lost to the atmosphere , which scientists say contributes to global warming			2
they concluded that building giant turbines on pristine peat should never be allowed , as the damage would outweigh any green benefits			0
the researchers found wind farms can still be built on degraded bogs , but ‘ good management ’ would be crucial if carbon savings are to be achieved			1
the new director - general of the @entity66 yesterday came to the defence of wind farms , describing turbines as ‘ beautiful ’ and arguing that future generations will look at them with fondness			1
in an interview , dame @entity73 said : ‘ wind turbines in the right place are fine			0
we object to wind turbines where they are a blot on our historic landscape			0
’ she added : ‘ i think they can look graceful , and this goes back to thinking in centuries			0
if you think back to what the railways looked like to the 19th century mind ... i think we have to have our minds open to how the wind turbine will appear to us in 100 years			0

in a letter to the journal nature , the @entity109 research team led by dr @entity110 wrote : ‘ we contend that wind farms on peatlands will probably not reduce emissions , unlike those on mineral soils			1
’ with carbon emissions for power production set to drop in the future , the scientists added : ‘ peatland sites would be less likely to generate a reduction in carbon emissions , even with careful management			2
unless the volume of peat excavated can be significantly reduced relative to energy output , we suggest that construction of wind farms on non-degraded peats should always be avoided			1
’ the wind industry insists that it increasingly builds ‘ floating roads ’ which do not disturb the peat			0
but wildlife conservationist and peat expert , @entity135 of the @entity136 , said these roads inevitably sink and cause long - lasting damage			0
it is estimated that half of all new wind farms are planned for areas that contain peat			1
‘ @entity144 is not suitable for wind farms for a whole host of environmental reasons , not just carbon loss , ’ said mr @entity135			1
‘ but even if we are just looking at greenhouse gas emissions , in the long run , the damage done to a peat bog by building roads and infrastructure will outweigh the benefit of building a wind farm			0
assess @entity37 impact of developments : researchers at the @entity28 ( pictured ) have devised a method to calculate the ' carbon payback ' time for wind farms on peat soil ‘ the tragic irony is that the exact places were blanket bogs develop are also perfect for wind farms in terms of the conditions and being away from residential areas			1
’ @entity172 , from the @entity173 , which campaigns to protect wild land , said : ‘ left in or restored to good condition , [ peatland ] lock in harmful greenhouse gas emissions			0
it therefore makes no sense to site major industrial wind developments that are supposed to be helping achieve @entity37 reduction targets , on such sites if they damage the peat and release significant amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere			2
’ @entity189 , a spokesman for @entity190 , which represents the wind farm industry , said : ‘ currently wind farm developers undergo an environmental impact assessment ahead of each development , so the benefits and costs of a scheme in total can be rigorously assessed			0
