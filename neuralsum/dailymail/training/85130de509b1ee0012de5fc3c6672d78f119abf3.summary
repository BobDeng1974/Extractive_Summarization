@entity0 : the blood - thirsty jungle cat is said to lie in wait for inebriated drinkers to totter by before pouncing , tearing them to pieces and eating their flesh a man - eating leopard is terrorising villagers in a remote part of @entity14 by only attacking men as they stumble home drunk - and has claimed at least 12 human lives in two years , villagers say			1
the blood - thirsty jungle cat has become infamous across the @entity18 region of the @entity19 , in northern @entity14 , where it is said to lie in wait for inebriated drinkers to totter by before pouncing , tearing them to pieces and eating their flesh			1
it has cast such fear across the region that local officials have dispatched an elite team of sharpshooters to hunt and kill the beast			1
but their efforts have so far drawn a blank			1
and , last month , the leopard again resurfaced to claim its twelfth victim , a 44 - year - old man from @entity35 village			1
the animal 's reign of terror has provoked such fear across the region that residents of more than 50 villages are refusing to go outdoors after sundown			1
@entity44 , from @entity43 village , told the @entity45 : ' villagers are terrorised by the wild animals and it 's almost impossible to venture out after dark			2
moving from one village to another or to markets through forested area becomes difficult			2
' people carry sticks with them and remain alert all the time			0
many in the village believe that drunk people are easy prey for the wild			0
' armed hunters have repeatedly been dispatched by the @entity61 to kill the beast before it causes any more deaths , but thus far without luck			2
@entity66 's @entity65 said : ' this month we had sent a team of shooters in the affected village , but they were unsuccessful in their mission			2
' this is the third attempt made so far '			0
the beast began its killing spree in january 2012 , when it attacked a 46 - year - old man from the @entity77 village			1
it went on to slay five more victims before that year was out , and five more in 2013			0
already this year it has killed two people , including the 44 - year - old man from @entity84 village on august 1			1
gripped by fear : the animal 's reign of terror has provoked such fear across the @entity18 region of the @entity19 ( pictured ) , northern @entity14 , that residents of more than 50 villages are refusing to go outdoors after sundown wildlife expert @entity93 said : ' after the forest department issued the warrant , i visited some of the affected areas in @entity18			1
we even spotted the animal , but failed to shoot it down			0
' the leopard is old and possibly without canines and it appears he has developed a taste for the human flesh			0
the animal is even consuming intestines , which is a surprising aspect '			1
but @entity112 , leading conservationist and head of the @entity111 , cast doubt on the claims that the leopard was specifically targeting drunks			0
" quite frankly when people are drunk and weave their way back home to the village they are easy prey , ' she said			2
' i do n't think the leopard is targeting drunk people , just people stumbling along the path at night			0
' she added : ' i 'm sure you wo n't taste any better because you 've consumed liquor			0
' the hunt continues .			0
