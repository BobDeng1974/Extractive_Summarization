by @entity0 published : 03:42 est , 10 december 2012 updated : 07:06 est , 10 december 2012 @entity2 bosses are ' tearing up the format ' of @entity5 's flagship show after a string of disastrous viewing figures , with sunday 's final drawing its worst audience for seven years			1
according to reports , @entity5 bosses are set to hold emergency talks with @entity13 in anticipation of a complete overhaul of the show 's format and judging panel			1
despite putting more money into the show 's budget , ratings have halved in two years , and now show chiefs are said to be planning a ' back to basics ' approach			0
revamp : it 's been reported that the @entity27 is set to go back to basic for the 10th series the @entity2 's ratings slide continued with sunday 's final pulling in 2 million fewer viewers than last year			1
crisis : @entity13 is set to sit down and talk through what 's next for @entity2 with @entity5 in the new year following poor ratings figures from @entity5 show that sunday night 's two - hour programme , which was won by @entity38 , had an average audience of 11.1 million compared with the 13.1 million who watched @entity41 win in 2011			1
and on saturday the first part of the @entity2 final - eventually won by @entity38 , 24 , had its worst audience for seven years as it failed to beat rival @entity44 again			1
@entity2 attracted an average audience of 9.5 million for the first stage of the final - the lowest audience since 2005 when 9.2 million watched @entity48 win the show			2
the @entity27 show trailed its @entity52 rival by 1.3 million viewers and it is especially embarrassing for @entity2 chiefs because @entity44 is still two weeks away from hosting its own final			1
now bosses are said to be planning to axe the arena auditions in favour of a more low - key approach			0
the new format will include shifting the start of next year 's show to the weekend after children return to school in order to make it more popular with a younger audience			2
according to @entity70 newspaper , saturday 's shows are set to start earlier to avoid the dip in ratings after 10pm			1
on the chopping board : according to a source @entity74 and @entity75 could be removed from the judging panel as @entity13 plans to rejig things a production source said : ' it does n’t take a genius to work out that the show is not in the best health			1
' we have had some very strong singers this year but the show is feeling in need of a reboot			0
' while another insider claims that @entity13 could return to the show as a judge solely during the live shows			1
. judges @entity74 and @entity75 are said to be favourites to face the chop in a cull of the judging panel			1
not winning : this year the final had its worst audience for seven years on saturday night - and it failed to beat rival @entity44 and one report claimed @entity101 was set to return to the @entity2 to give the show a boost			1
no chance : @entity101 will not be returning to the show that unceremoniously dumped her but this was categorically denied by the @entity109 's singer 's spokesperson			2
this sounded even more unlikely against the backdrop of @entity101 's $ 1.4million lawsuit against the @entity113 @entity2 blindsided show bosses			2
a source close to @entity13 said : ‘ this is a bolt from the blue			0
@entity13 thought he ’d patched things up with @entity101			2
but now she ’s attacking when the show is weak			0
' in sunday 's live final @entity38 , was speechless as he learned that he had gained more votes than runner up @entity122			2
he said : ' thank you , thank you so much			0
have i really won ? wow			0
i do n't know what to say			0
' @entity122 praised the winner and told @entity128 : ' it 's such a blessing to even share a stage with such a talent , he 's my idol			0
' the @entity133 - born star , who won with 54 percent of the public vote , was presented with his winner 's single , a cover of @entity138			0
a spokeswoman for the show said : ' the series has only just ended but of course we 'll review the production , as we do with all our long - running shows			0
no details on next year 's show have been decided yet			0
