@entity1 defender @entity0 feels they are hitting form and fitness at the perfect time as they prepare for some momentous cup ties and respond to a title challenge			1
with @entity1 and @entity9 vying for top spot in the @entity11 , @entity0 helped his team to a third consecutive win by scoring a double in a 4 - 0 win over @entity16 on wednesday night			1
the @entity17 came within inches of a second - half hat - trick when he hit the bar in the closing stages as he marked his comeback from a two - month injury lay - off in some style			0
@entity0 ( left ) believes his @entity1 team are hitting form at the right time of the season the 28 - year - old is looking for more action when @entity1 face @entity31 in @entity33 on saturday in their final game before the eagerly - awaited @entity35 semi-final against @entity37			1
' hopefully i can stay fit now but of course we know we have a lot of important games and fun games coming up in february , ' he said			0
' the @entity37 game of course is a massive game but also the cup game against @entity47 is going to be big as well			0
' you always want to play in the big games so all the players will want to be part of that			0
' @entity53 ( right ) is , like @entity54 , recovering from injury and hopes to be in the first team soon @entity9 recently matched @entity1 's earlier eight - match winning league run , which has jolted @entity1 into action in recent weeks			1
and with the likes of @entity53 joining @entity0 in overcoming injury , and a rejuvenated @entity62 regaining his place in the team , the @entity17 feels they have the resources to meet the demands of competing on four fronts			1
' we need to be focused on every game now , ' @entity0 said			2
' @entity9 have done really well and if they keep winning we need to win as well			2
' we are going to need all the players now and we need to be ready when we are out there			0
' @entity1 have scored eight goals without reply in their three games in 2015 and @entity0 believes they are showing they have adapted to the tactics of manager @entity77 following a difficult opening few months for the @entity79 boss			1
@entity0 believes the team took a while to learn the way of playing that new coach @entity77 implemented ' we can still manage to do things better but we always had a feeling we were heading in the right direction , ' the @entity83 international said			1
' we are getting there			0
' when you change manager , it 's another way to play and the best way to get better is to play games			0
' you know you are going to have some games where you do n't look good and you maybe feel a bit lost , but most of the players know how to play the game now and how to work as a team			2
i think we will be there soon			0

@entity1 lead the @entity11 , but are only a point above @entity9
@entity77 's side do have a game in hand over the @entity9
defender @entity0 feels the team is *peaking* at the best time possible
