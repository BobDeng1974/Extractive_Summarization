former secretary of state and potential 2016 presidential candidate @entity1 made it very clear during an appearance earlier this week that she is no fan of @entity5 , the former @entity7 contractor who leaked thousands of classified documents to journalists and who currently is avoiding criminal charges by hiding out in @entity13			1
the former first lady attended a discussion at the @entity16 on wednesday and was asked whether @entity5 's leaks had done anything to help national security , or the discourse about how far the government can go in terms of domestic intelligence gathering			1
@entity24 said she feels that the balance between privacy and security is important , but the way @entity5 went about bringing the information to light was damaging to national security and may have inadvertently helped terrorist groups			1
she went on to say that she does n't ' understand why he could n't have been part of the debate at home , ' before taking classified documents to other countries			0
@entity24 went to explain how @entity5 could have had a bigger impact if he had turned the information over to officials and asked for whistleblower protection			1
' when he emerged and when he absconded with all that material , i was puzzled , because we have all these protections for whistleblowers , ' @entity24 said			0
' if he were concerned and wanted to be part of the @entity38 debate , he could have been			0
but it struck me as — i just have to be honest with you — as sort of odd that he would flee to @entity72 , because @entity73 is controlled by @entity72 , and that he would then go to @entity13 , two countries with which we have very difficult cyber-relationships , to put it mildly			0
' phony : @entity24 mocked @entity5 's question for @entity79 about whether @entity13 has any spy programs similar to ones he exposed in the @entity38 @entity24 , a former senator from @entity82 before being appointed secretary of state , explained to the audience that having worked in the @entity85 and the @entity86 , she is much better informed about the threats that face the @entity38 than the average citizen - many of whom look at @entity5 as a hero			1
' there are people right this minute trying to figure out how to do harm to @entity38 and to other innocent people , ' @entity24 said before explaining that the balance between security and privacy may have shifted towards security in the post- 9/11 world , but that the @entity7 's intelligence gathering is what 's helping to prevent another terrorist attack			1
after he had stolen the classified documents , @entity5 went to @entity73 , which is ruled by @entity72 , before settling in @entity13			0
@entity24 said by doing so , @entity5 has essentially helped these countries - both of which have somewhat strained relations with @entity38 - gather intelligence about @entity38 security forces			2
' when i would go to @entity72 or i would go to @entity13 , ' she said , ' we would leave all my electronic equipment on the plane with the batteries out , because this is a new frontier and they 're trying to find out not just about what we do in our government , they 're trying to find out about what a lot of companies do and they were going after the personal emails of people who worked in the @entity85			0
it 's not like the only government in the world that is doing anything is the @entity38			0
' ' i have a hard time thinking that somebody who is a champion of privacy and liberty has taken refuge in @entity13 under @entity79 's authority , ' @entity24 said of @entity5 @entity24 also mocked @entity5 's recent call - in to a supposed q&a with @entity13 president @entity79 , who granted @entity5 temporary asylum in his country after he leaked the classified documents			1
during the q&a @entity5 cautiously asked the @entity13 president if the @entity13 government had spy programs similar to those of the @entity38			2
mocking @entity5 and @entity79 's response , @entity24 condescendingly paraphrased @entity79 's answer , saying , ' well from one intelligence professional to another , of course not			2
' ' oh , thank you so much , ' she continued to mock			0
' @entity24 also took a shot at @entity5 's claim that he 's a passionate defender of privacy and liberty			1
' i have a hard time thinking that somebody who is a champion of privacy and liberty has taken refuge in @entity13 under @entity79 's authority , ' she said			2
@entity79 's government has routinely jailed those who oppose his rule , including members of the punk band @entity169 and longtime political opponent @entity170 , whom @entity79 had jailed for eight years .			0

@entity24 says @entity5 's leaks did nothing to help national security
the former secretary of state says @entity5 should have revealed his information to @entity38 officials under whistleblower protections rather than hand it over to foreign governments
the possible 2016 presidential candidate says she 's puzzled how someone who supposedly is so dedicated to privacy and liberty would choose to live in @entity13 under @entity79
