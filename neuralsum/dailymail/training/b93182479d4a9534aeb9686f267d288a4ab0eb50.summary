by @entity0 and @entity1 the selfie - taking tourist who was kicked in the head as a train sped by him has broken his silence over the ordeal			1
@entity7 , from @entity8 , @entity9 , claims he was making his way to @entity11 , in @entity12 , when the train 's engineer taught him a valuable lesson but did not hurt him very much			1
he dismissed to @entity18 speculation the video was a @entity21 hoax , and also that the engineer was trying to save his life since he was n't on the front of the train			1
' the train definitely was n't going the same speed as it was the first time			1
it was going normal train speed , ' he told the network			1
' that 's why the video starts within , like , a second of me getting kicked in the head			1
' @entity7 is shown standing beside the tracks just as the train approaches and he meets the business end of the engineer 's black leather boot			1
' i pressed play and was going to look at where the train was , but by that time , i already got kicked in the head , ' he lamented			1
the @entity61 claimed the drop kick did not hurt was more of a shock than anything else			0
he also doubted the engineer 's intentions towards helping him avoid more serious injury , or even possible death			2
here comes trouble : the train 's engineer appears on the side of the train ready to kick the kid ' he wasnâ € ™ t on the front of the train , ' said the somewhat embarrassed man			2
' he was on four feet off the front of the train kind of a thing			2
' so if the train was going to hit me , it was going to hit me before his boot ever reached me			2
' despite not believing the conductor had good intentions , he did sheepishly admit how silly the video has made him look			0
' honestly , even the truth is a little ridiculous and it does make me look stupid , ' he said			0
' but it was an accident and i got it on film and i think it would have been a shame to just throw it away			0
' speaking to the @entity94 , @entity7 dismissed the criticism he has received around the world for the humiliating boot			2
' i ignore it , they 're just faceless people on the internet , ' he told the paper			0
' i never really understood the term ' i love haters ' until now			0
' if i was n't the one in the video , i 'd be making those comments too			0
' uploading the video to @entity106 , @entity7 attempted to explain that he ' tried to take a selfie while a train passed a ' safe ' distance behind '			1
but conceded , ' i guess i was still too close and got kicked in the head			0
however , despite his admission of a lesson well - learned following the engineer 's justified swing , @entity7 's first reaction as captured in his video is amazement			1
instead of saying ' @entity119 ! ' , or ' maybe i was too close to the train ' , @entity7 exclaims , ' wow ! i got kicked in the head ! i think i got that on film ! ' smack : the boot of the conductor connects cleanly with the young man follow - through : the train speeds past and the young man 's head feels the full force of the conductors boot but , before everyone holds this up as another example of the extreme lengths people will now go to for the perfect selfie , some have joked they see the hand at work of @entity142 's prankster in chief , @entity21			1
indeed , @entity144 , the editor of the @entity145 tweeted that he would find it amusing if the video was revealed to be a set - up , filmed on an @entity150 studio lot and that the engineer was in fact @entity21			2
but this has since been proven not to be the case			0
the @entity150 late - night host has a past history for viral internet pranks - during the @entity158 he managed to get a picture of a wolf roaming the athletes village to go viral			0
in fact it was a fake , but that did not stop multiple outlets running with the image			0
that really hurt : the young man feels his face after his kick			0

@entity7 was struck in the head by the engineer of a single locomotive *car* and uploaded the video to @entity106
he claims the video is real and that he did not expect the train to come up on him at such a high rate of speed
