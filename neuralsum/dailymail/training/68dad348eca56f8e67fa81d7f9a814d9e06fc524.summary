a devoted dog has proved its unfailing love for its master after it raced after an ambulance which was taking him to hospital			1
desperate not to lose sight of the vehicle , the pet was filmed bounding along in the @entity9 in the driver 's wing mirror by an astounded paramedic in @entity13 , @entity14			1
the recording , released on the weekend , then switches to the passenger 's side and captures the adorable creature bounding beside the vehicle for several minutes in its determination to keep up			0
eventually the crew in @entity13 , @entity14 , let him aboard exhausted : at one stage the dog crossed to the pavement , beginning to fall behind as it ran out of breath at one stage the dog starts to fall behind as it begins to run out of breath , but keeping close to the side of the ambulance , the pet looks up appealingly at the crew as if pleading for help			1
realising the long journey to the general hospital will be too much for the animal , the ambulance crew eventually decide to stop the vehicle and let the ' @entity23 ' climb on board			1
@entity50 do @entity51 , 42 , who made the video , said the whole service team was touched by the love shown by the dog for its owner , a homeless man			1
' i 've been doing this job for 19 years and i 've never seen anything like it , ' said mr @entity62			1
' sometimes we arrive at the scene of an emergency and there are pets around but they are too shy for us to get close to and they often run way			0
i have never seen this reaction in all my career			0
' reinvigorated : the dog ran alongside the ambulance between it and the pavement , to the crew 's amazement catch - up : the dog drawing level with the ambulance in a feat which prompted pity by the crew commenting in the video , mr @entity62 says to his colleague as he watches the dog chase the ambulance – ' does n't he get tired ? ' then to the dog he shouts – ' go home			2
go and have a rest , give up			0
' on board , the faithful companion won praise for its good behaviour			0
the crew allowed it to sit next to the owner in the ambulance all the way to the hospital			1
' we could n't believe how well - behaved the dog was , ' he added			0
' it just sat quietly and patiently beside its owner			0
it did n't even bark			0
' the man was in and out of consciousness but he could see his companion was right there with him on the way '			0
once at the hospital , the owner , who had suffered an epileptic seizure , was placed on a stretcher			2
let me on board ! the pet looks imploringly up at the ambulance 's crew , one of whom filmed the scene @entity50 do @entity62 said : ' in 19 years and i 've never seen anything like it ' faithful : the dog next to its owner on a stretcher in hospital			1
the outcome of his treatment is unknown the affectionate pet was again filmed hovering close by , eventually settling down patiently to stay beside the bedside			2
the hospital has not been able to comment on the outcome of the man 's hospital stay and whether he recovered to leave with his pet			2
' unfortunately , i was n't able to find out what happened to the pet and its owner , but it has certainly given me faith in the loyalty and love that exists between owners and their dogs , ' said mr @entity62 .			2
