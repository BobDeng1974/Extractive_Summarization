we 've all been guilty of over-packing for a holiday abroad			1
even if you 're only jetting off on a quick weekend jaunt , it 's easy to start dreaming up every possible weather contingency or holiday activity scenario that could have you needing those knee - high wellies , your full gym kit , or one of your many hair - styling gadgets			1
but does anyone ever actually use these ' must have ' items ? almost never			2
@entity23 , flat irons , curling irons this one often winds up being completely redundant			2
' almost all hotels and many hostels have them , ' says @entity29 , writer and owner of travel blog , a lady in @entity33			1
' @entity34 just take up a lot of space in luggage			2
' ' @entity39 , if you 're travelling abroad , you 'll often find that your hairdryer does n't even work due to different electric voltage in other countries			2
' leave your blowdryers at home ... most hotels and hostels have them these days anyway more than one jacket or coat this is a packing faux pas with one heavy price to pay - it will weigh your bag down and may even require you to opt for a checked case over carry - on luggage			1
' too many coats and jackets can be a pain because they take up space and weight , ' @entity58 fashion blogger , @entity57 , admits			1
' on cold breaks away , i 've now learnt to just wear one on - board and stick to it			0
' you wo n't wear those flimsy summer dresses - and if you do , you 'll wind up freezing , like this woman ( left ) seasonally inappropriate dresses ' i always pack lots of slip dresses , ' @entity57 continues			1
' i do n't even know where one buys slip dresses anymore but i have a stash of vintage ones that in my head are ' handy ' for holidays			0
i 'll layer them , i think			0
' noted : leave all rarely worn flimsy frocks at home			1
trainers take up a lot of space in your carry - on , and , be honest : will you really hit the hotel gym ? a full gym kit it 's been a busy week leading up to your holiday in the sun and you have n't had time to exercise			1
no problem , you think , i 'll work out in the hotel gym once i arrive			0
this is rarely the case			0
instead , you wind up taking up precious space with trainers , spandex leggings and a sports bra that you wo n't look at again during your getaway			0
if you pack your best lingerie , you 're more likely to meet the man of your dreams , right ? er , maybe not ... lingerie if you plan for it , that must mean that you 'll meet the man of your dreams on holiday , does n't it ? of course there 's always a chance , but that stiff corset you shoved into your bag probably is n't even all that necessary when it comes to wooing said hypothetical guy			1
way too many tampons even if it 's not that dreaded time of the month - does n't matter - a lady must always be prepared			0
nevermind the fact that almost any destination you 're heading off to will likely sell the products in question , we all know those women who insist on bringing the entire variety pack			1
even if it 's not that time of the month , many women still feel the need to pack several variety packs several handbag options you need one for touring during the day , a smaller option for a night out , and a carry - all for the plane , right ? before you know it , half of your suitcase is comprised of handbags			1
we went to the experts to find the perfect all - round option			0
' i take a rucksack or a roomy crossover bag with secure closures , ' @entity57 says			1
' i do n't do clutches on holiday - too easy to lose or get stolen and not enough room to carry all the essentials			1
' think you 'll read that book you 've been meaning to for months ? probably not on the plane ... that book you ’ve been meaning to read chances are , if the book has been collecting dust on your bookshelf for several weeks , your upcoming plane ride is almost certainly not the time you 'll finally crack it open			0
excessive amounts of beauty products an array of moisturisers and cleansers ? leave them			0
nail varnish remover ? nope , you wo n't use it			0
when it comes to bringing beauty products abroad , stick to the basics and try to opt for an all - in - one compact			0
makeup artist and @entity181 video blogger , @entity182 , says : ' i tend to take products that have multiple purposes , like @entity187 creams that have coverage and @entity189 or lip and cheek duos			1
' ' @entity193 water is also great as it removes makeup from eyes , lips and cheeks , ' adds @entity198 , editor of beauty website , get the gloss			0
instead of taking your entire beauty bag , opt for products that pull double duty or an all - in - one compact expensive jewellery why risk it ? those shoes you never wear ( be it sky - high stilettos or rubber wellie boots ) ' one pair of shoes for walking around during the day and another for any dressier occasions in the evening is usually sufficient , ' @entity29 says			0
' leave the ' just in case ' shoes at home			1
they can take up a lot of packing space , often unnecessarily			2
' those sky - high stilettos you never wear ? the best time to try them out is definitely not during a holiday stay aware from alluring airport bargains ! the only travel accessory you really need is an adaptor loads of travel gadgets and accessories all you really need is an adaptor ( depending on where you 're headed ) and your smart phone to keep you connected			1
and when it comes to those bargain travel accessories , skip the airport shops and their allure - including those inflatable pillows , hand - held fans and under - clothes money belts			2
‘ i have a leopard eye mask that i always think i will use , but in reality , am far too embarrassed to take out of my bag , ’ says @entity243 , a @entity244 - based fashion writer			2
full - size shampoo and conditioner this can be a tempting one			0
after all , you never know how the cold air , or alternatively , the heat and humidity , will mess with your hair			0
still , most hotels do leave mini versions out for guests and , really , is packing the gargantuan bottles really worth being forced to check your bag ?			2

most women fall *victim* to over-packing when heading off on holiday
