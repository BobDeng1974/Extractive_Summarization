@entity2 musician @entity1 did n't just win the top gong for his song , talk is @entity5 , in triple j 's @entity6 for 2014 - he also scored the seventh and eight position in the top ten			1
but the real moment every music fan had been waiting for was whether @entity13 pop sensation @entity12 managed to sneak into the world 's biggest music poll as rumours spread that the singer being banned from the annual countdown was part of a hoax			1
despite the huge online campaign , # tay4hottest100 , to include the @entity13 star 's smash hit , shake it off , in the prestigious countdown - the chart topper , who garnered so much support that her single was expected to be voted in at number 12 , was disqualified due to her affiliation with @entity32 following triple j 's strict policy on artists not benefiting from commercial ventures that could influence votes from fans			1
this violated @entity53 's strict rules of entry although the award - winning artist did n't quit make the cut , @entity56 electronic music duo , @entity57 , bagged two top five positions with @entity61 ( featuring @entity62 ) landing second place and take me over ( featuring @entity65 ) in fifth spot			2
@entity61 ( featuring @entity62 ) 3			0
@entity57 - take me over ( featuring @entity72 ) 6			0
@entity74 - @entity73 ( featuring @entity75 ) 7			0
@entity78 - @entity77 @entity79 and @entity80 while @entity56 hip hop band , @entity68 , who got their big break thanks to triple j 's early support , came third with their single , @entity69			0
the other two songs by @entity1 that were voted into the top ten were @entity76 , at seventh place with eighth spot going to 1998			0
before the music countdown began , there was a drum roll and @entity53 's @entity93 announced that @entity12 will not be appearing in this year ’s list ‘ for a whole range of reasons ’			2
an article with a comprehensive explanation for the decision was put on the @entity53 website , but very few are privy to this information as the website crashed just a minute after it was posted			1
@entity104 viewed the post which is titled ' eight hilarious but totally true reasons you did n't hear @entity12 in the @entity6 '			2
the humorous article , laden with sarcasm , has copied the format of the website ' @entity111 ' which lead the # tay4hottest100 campaign			1
' their # @entity116 campaign bought @entity12 a one - way ticket to bansville , ' a @entity53 author wrote			2
although they did wish to clarify , ' triple j does n't have beef with @entity12			0
' ' she 's smart , she 's cool and she has excellent taste in @entity124 , ' in reference to @entity12 's friendship with @entity127 , who made numerous appearances in last year 's @entity6 countdown			1
@entity56 electronic music duo , @entity57 , express their gratitude on @entity132 for bagging two top five positions on the @entity6 the @entity53 website crashed just a minute after a link was posted explaining the decision to disqualify @entity12 from this year 's @entity6 before the music countdown began , there was a drum roll and @entity53 's @entity93 announced that @entity12 will not be appearing in this year ’s list ‘ for a whole range of reasons ’ however , they did point out that a @entity12 song was not played on @entity53 at any point in 2014			1
the @entity53 author explains that they took issue with the fact @entity111 , an international media company worth $ 850 million and the allegedly the leading source of cat gifs , was ' throwing their weight around to influence a publicly voted music poll '			2
' it 's not legit for other media to try and troll the poll , ' @entity53 wrote			0
@entity53 has strict rules which promise to ' remove artists from the list who have benefited from competitions or commercial campaigns that incentivise fans to vote for them '			2
the article then points out the number of ' trolls ' who voted for @entity12 to ' prod the hipsters for lulz ' , meaning they did not vote for the young muso because of a genuine interest in the countdown			2
' do we really want to be talking about this every year ? ' @entity53 asked			0
they argue that if the @entity12 campaign was successful it would have a long - term impact on their music poll , with other campaigns inevitably set to follow in future years , supporting people like ' @entity182 , @entity183 and @entity184 '			1
that would be a ' sh * * * y , sh * * * y tragedy			0
' @entity32 were also pointed out as being partially responsible for their decision after the fast food chain launched a campaign endorsing the pop icon in the lead up to the annual @entity196 countdown			1
' not every @entity32 idea is a good one , ' pointed out @entity53 in their ' @entity200 ' post			0
the fast food giant jumped on the frenzied social media attempt to include the starlet in the @entity6 , a campaign which has sparked both waves of support and fury from polarised music lovers			1
the fast food chain offered a $ 19.89 voucher , in reference to the pop star 's latest album 1989 , to customers who posted their favourite @entity12 song - a move which may breach the countdown 's strict policy of banning artists who give their fans incentives to vote			1
' " we 'd prefer that people vote for the love of music , not the love of cholesterol " , ' @entity53 responded on @entity196 , hitting out at the fast food chain after they tried to cash in on the @entity6 hype			1
an article with a comprehensive explanation for the decision was put on the @entity53 website , but very few are privy to this information as the website crashed just a minute after it was posted triple j confirmed that the voucher was in direct violation of the @entity6 voting rules , which clearly state that the station will ' remove artists from the list who have benefited from competitions or commercial campaigns that incentivise fans to vote for them '			1
while @entity246 declined to comment officially before the countdown , former @entity53 announcer @entity245 told @entity248 on monday that @entity12 had been disqualified			2
last week , unconfirmed rumours were rife that @entity12 had been disqualified because of this campaign			0
' you probably know that there was a push to get a @entity12 song in ( the @entity6 ) , which has now been disqualified because a fast food chain became involved in the whole process , ' ms @entity245 said			1
following the announcment , @entity258 was bombarded with posts – some celebrating the decision , others devastated by @entity12 ’s exclusion			0
‘ dear @ triplej why do you hate joy and puppies and kittens and bubbles and good things you monsters , ’ wrote @entity264			0
‘ is it too cliche to tell @ taylorswift13 fans to shake it off ? ’ said @entity272 - @entity271 ‘ now the people who were waiting for @entity12 , but have never listened to @ triplej can go away now , ’ said @entity276			0
almost in direct response , @entity278 posted ‘ so , @ triplej just ensured i wo n't be listening to any of the # hottest100 this year by not including # taylorswift			0
’ @entity282 : in retaliation , extreme alternative music fans with a penchant for violent threats then took to social media to intimidate @entity12 supporters the response to the potential blow @entity32 may have dealt to the # tay4hottest100campaign has been as divided as the movement itself			1
' thank you @entity32 ! ! ! you just invalidated this song from being in the hottest 100 by commercially incentivising it ! ! ! ' said one @entity299 user			0
' i hope that was your plan all along this just made my day as now i know the hottest 100 wont be tainted by this rubbish '			0
' you 've ruined # @entity304 @entity32 ! @entity305 ! ! ! ' said another user			0
other social media commentators were pleased with the seemingly unintended outcome			0
for the first time ever @entity32 has done something useful and gotten @entity12 disqualified from the hottest 100 , ' said one @entity299 user			1
' if this is the reason swift gets disqualified from the hottest 100 then i hereby pledge to only eat @entity32 when i have that fast food craving ...			1
a spokesperson for @entity32 spoke out about the campaign , denying accusations of ' incetivising ' people to vote for @entity12 in the @entity6			1
' we know many of our fans are music lovers and our recent post has caused a bit of a stir so to avoid any more confusion we have removed the post			0
' ' the post simply asked our fans to tell us what their favourite @entity12 song was for the opportunity to win a voucher , we were not incentivising people to vote for the @entity6			1
earlier on tuesday , an unofficial poll shed some insight into who might take home the coveted @entity6 crown , with @entity12 making the cut despite the controversy			2
@entity12 was given a number 75 ranking on the @entity340 which has proved an inaccurate prediction , many hipsters nationwide may well hurl into fits of rage come @entity196 when the @entity53 station 's annual alternative music poll hits the airwaves			1
nasty : ' i hope you die a slow , painful death , ' one wrote to a voter , while another compared a fan to @entity354 too cool for school : the campaign to get @entity12 on the list kicked off after super fan @entity358 tweeted @entity246 boss @entity359 ( pictured ) about the omission of @entity12 's hit shake it off from the voting list			2

@entity1 won triple j 's @entity6 for 2014 with his song talk is cheap
@entity12 was disqualified from appearing in the annual music poll
a viral campaign *encouraged* *members* of the public to vote for @entity12 so she could top the @entity196 countdown
the triple j website crashed a minute after an article explaining the decision was posted
@entity32 jumped on the # tay4hottest100 campaign to include @entity12 in the annual triple j @entity6 countdown
the move may breach the strict voting rules , which disqualify artists who offer fans *encouragement* to vote for them
former triple j presenter @entity245 said @entity12 had been excluded based on ' a fast food chain be involved in the process '
