@entity0 scored and @entity1 capitulated in the second half			1
@entity3 must have thought it was @entity5			0
cruising at 2 - 0 , @entity1 produced an utterly inept second half display as @entity7 wasted a glut of clear cut chances as the @entity10 were made to sweat on their three points when the game looked all but won			1
@entity3 had a face like thunder as he stormed off the pitch back to the dressing room after the final whistle , hardly the demeanour of a manager whose side just won			0
@entity0 scored the game 's decisive goal with his first half header to put @entity1 2 - 0 up against @entity24 @entity0 ( right ) is hugged by @entity25 ( centre ) after doubling @entity1 lead in @entity27 on thursday night @entity7 : @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 ( @entity35 81 ) , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 ( @entity39 60 ) , @entity40 ( @entity41 84 )			1
subs : @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46			0
booked : @entity30 goal : @entity41 90 @entity1 : @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity25 , @entity55 ( @entity56 ) , @entity58 ( @entity59 63 ) , @entity0 ( @entity57 77 )			1

booked : @entity59 sent off : @entity50 goals : @entity25 36 , @entity0 42 referee : @entity44 ( @entity67 ) and no wonder as his side threatened to throw , what should have been a routine win , away			1
on the plus side for the @entity73 , @entity0 scored â€¦ again			2
surely , the forward will think it 's personal if he does n't start against @entity76 on sunday			0
what more does he have to do ? he took his tally to 10 goals in this @entity81 win			0
his first league start of the season against @entity85 ' men must surely be a certainty now			0
@entity1 made nine changes for thursday night 's clash , with @entity89 and @entity58 the only survivors from sunday 's last - gasp win over @entity92			2
that meant another chance for man - of - the - moment @entity0 to persuade @entity3 that he should be the man to lead @entity1 's so far misfiring strike force			1
around 300 or so hardy souls made their to the @entity98 outpost for the clash that would see @entity1 take a giant step towards qualification for the next round with victory			2
the encounter has been billed as the biggest night in @entity7 ' history			0
if that was the case , then it certainly did n't feel that way			0
the crowd , in the 7,500 capacity @entity109 , were subdued			0
as were their team as @entity1 took control of the opening 10 minutes without creating a clear - cut chance			1
and slowly , @entity117 felt their way into proceedings , awakening from their early slumber			0
@entity31 sent a towering header from @entity33 's corner just wide in the 15th minute before @entity52 had a weak penalty appeal rejected afar a tangle with @entity126 in the box			2
suddenly the home crowd started to perk up , and their team responded ; sankare flicking a header narrowly wide after @entity37 's well - flighted free - kick			2
then @entity36 missed the best chance of the opening 30 minutes , miscuing a strike from a good position 15 yards out wide of @entity48 's far post following good work from @entity34			0
@entity1 defender @entity50 ( right ) shields the ball away from @entity138 ' @entity38 during thursday 's @entity81 tie @entity1 captain for the night @entity89 chests the ball as @entity1 play their fourth @entity81 match in @entity142 @entity53 ( left ) and @entity138 ' @entity36 battle for the ball at the @entity109 @entity25 opened the scoring for the @entity146 side converting a penalty he won after being fouled in the box @entity25 ( centre ) is congratulated by his @entity1 team - mates after giving them the lead against @entity138 click here to view our brilliant @entity153 including the move for @entity0 's goal to put @entity1 2 - 0 ahead but @entity1 were handed a lifeline in the 36th minute when @entity30 launched himself at @entity25 in the box			1
the @entity138 central - defender looked to have taken at least some of the ball , but @entity163 referee @entity44 pointed to the spot , much to @entity126 's disbelief			2
and @entity25 picked himself up to fire the resultant spot - kick past @entity28 into the top right - hand corner			1
the goal was exactly what @entity1 needed after a less than convincing start , and so it proved as they doubled their lead three minutes before the break			2
and it was the simplest of goals , too , @entity25 , with the freedom of the left - hand side , firing in a pinpoint cross to allow @entity0 to nod home from close range for his 10th of the season			1
@entity49 ( left ) tackles @entity36 as the pair tussle for the ball during their @entity142 encounter @entity55 ( left ) failed to repeat his two - goal salvo in the reverse fixture a fortnight ago against @entity138 it surely ca n't be long before @entity3 succumbs to supporter pressure and finally hand @entity0 the @entity190 start he rightfully deserves			2
the @entity1 academy graduate , however , showed his human on the stroke of half - time somehow contriving to hit the bar from a yard out following @entity49 's low cross - though his blushes were spared by an offside flag			1
@entity1 were in full control , but the way they started the second period had @entity3 fuming in his technical area			2
less than 30 seconds after the restart , @entity38 fired @entity37 's pass wide with just @entity48 to beat			0
@entity25 ( left ) sprints after the ball against defender @entity29 during the second half in @entity27 @entity3 yells out instructions to his @entity1 players as they seek victory against @entity138 @entity0 ( right ) evades the challenge of @entity29 during thursday night 's @entity81 clash @entity0 has now scored 10 goals in all competitions for @entity1 this season so far following his header against @entity138 @entity37 then fired wide narrowly wide from distance before @entity50 's dalliance on the ball caused further chaos in the @entity1 box			1
@entity117 were carving @entity1 open at will , @entity37 missing two guild - edged chances with just @entity48 in front of him following poor defending from captain @entity51 and @entity50			1
@entity3 was furious , the wounds from the way his side surrendered their 1 - 0 lead against @entity230 last month just eight seconds into the restart far from healed			0
and @entity117 kept coming , @entity36 firing straight at @entity48 when he should really have done better before he hit the post with an excellent right - footed strike			0
@entity138 striker @entity41 ( third left ) celebrates his goal to set up a grandstand finale against @entity1 @entity48 then produced then produced two brilliant saves to first deny @entity31 's instinctive volley and then substitute @entity238 's			1
and a night that was running smoothly ended in chaos as @entity50 bundled down substitute @entity41 in the box to gift the @entity243 a penalty in the first minute of stoppage time and caused the visitors to finish the game with 10 men as the @entity249 saw red			1
@entity41 slotted home the penalty to set - up a grandstand finale before @entity238 thought he clinched a dramatic draw , but his header hit the side netting when home supporters thought the ball had nestled on the other side of the post			1
and breathe , @entity1 fans			0
despite the victory , @entity3 ( right ) looked unhappy with his team 's performance in @entity27 on thursday night			0

@entity25 opened the scoring for @entity1 from the penalty spot in the 36th minute
@entity0 doubled the visitors *advantage* before half - time rising high to score with a header
spurs were reduced to 10 men in the dying moments after @entity50 *hauled* down @entity41
@entity41 pulled one back for the hosts from the penalty spot to cause a nervy finish
