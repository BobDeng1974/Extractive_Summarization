by @entity0 published : 04:49 est , 1 may 2012 updated : 08:08 est , 1 may 2012 under fire : the @entity2 , lays down the lowest animal welfare standards of any quality mark hundreds of brands in @entity7 's supermarket carry the @entity2 food assurance label , but it is now under fire for scoring the lowest animal welfare standards of any quality mark , according to a new report			2
the label 's animal welfare practices have led the authors of the 60 - page report to advise shoppers to look for schemes which scored higher in their treatment of animals			1
the damning report into assurance schemes in the @entity7 was carried out by two charities , @entity23 and @entity24			2
the @entity26 and @entity27 research , found that the @entity2 , @entity7 's biggest food label , officially known as @entity2 , did little more than meet legal requirements			1
the two charities behind the report , advised consumers to buy meat carrying the @entity35 or @entity36 logo			1
the @entity2 logo guarantees basic @entity7 standards , which are higher than imports from some countries with lower welfare legislation			2
it achieved a low score in the study for areas including pigs mutilations with the report recommending the ' prohibition of mutilations of pigs , or at least stringent restrictions on mutilations			1
' it also stated the label should introduce ' a requirement to use anaesthetic for tail docking and a requirement to use teeth grinding instead of teeth clipping			2
' @entity61 , of @entity23 said ' all too often the farmers turn to routine tail docking of piglets to avoid tail biting rather than addressing the cause of the problem – lack of enrichment			2
routine tail docking is not only painful , it ’s illegal			0
' @entity23 urges @entity7 pig farmers not only to follow the law , but to go beyond it and provide the best possible conditions for their pigs , ' she added			0
criticism : the @entity2 food label was criticised for allowing pig tail - docking without anaesthetic tail docking is carried out on approximately 80 per cent of piglets in the @entity7 to try to reduce the risk of tail biting when they are older			0
tail biting , which may be a symptom of physical or mental stress , is painful and can lead to serious injury			0
the law prohibits the routine docking of piglets ’ tails , but it can be carried out provided other measures have been taken first to try to reduce tail biting			0
these include providing environmental enrichment material ( e.g. straw ) , providing more space per pig , and increasing the amount of feeding space available			0
farmers say docking is necessary to prevent infection as a result of bites from fellow animals			1
to dock , farmers cut off a portion of the tail with a pair of pliers or a knife , frequently without anaesthetic			0
source : @entity35 the @entity2 label which is shown on £ 12bn worth of food annually , was generally given ' major improvement needed ' in nearly every category			1
' it was recommended to improve in categories such as providing more space for animals and reducing the time the animals spent in transportation and achieved low scores for genetically modified or cloned animals as well as tethering of sheep and cattle			1
the report graded the labels according to bronze , silver and gold level ratings			0
@entity138 meant the label achieved a score of 50 per cent or higher and means it offered an acceptable standard of welfare , but with many important issues still unresolved			1
silver is achieved if the label manages to obtain 70 per cent or higher and offers a good standard , but still has areas which need improving			1
and gold standard is awarded if the label offers a high standard of welfare and achieves 90 per cent or over			1
in the summary , the report concluded : ' the @entity2 ( @entity154 ) schemes generally scored poorly			0
free - range standards for broiler chickens and turkeys achieved abronze farming system rating but neither these standards , nor any of the other @entity2 schemes , achieved an overall scheme rating for anyspecies			1
' the @entity2 standards offer few welfare benefits compared with standard industry practice and generally only ensure compliance with minimum legislative requirements ( the interpretation of which is considered inadequate in some cases )			0
' other labels tested include @entity173 , @entity174 and @entity175 - the latter scored extremely highly and achieved a gold standard			1
it came first place of the schemes analysed across all species			0
the farming system was rated gold for pigs and laying hens and silver for all other species			0
overall , the @entity36 scheme was rated silver for all species , except sheep , for which it was rated bronze			1
the report recommended that it improved its score in killing surplus male animals			2
coming in at second place , the @entity195 achieved good scores for all species , and overall the scheme was rated bronze			1
the @entity35 scheme consistently out - performed the other schemes in certain areas , but still has recommended points for improvement such as adequate outdoor space for animals			1
under scrutiny : the report also tested labels such as ( l - r ) @entity173 , @entity174 and @entity36 - the latter scored extremely highly and achieved a gold standard the @entity212 achieved a silver farming system rating for its free - range laying hen standards but scored very poorly for its minimum standards in areas such as animal housing and transportation duration			1
in response to the research , @entity220 , ceo , @entity221 said : ' we believe this a shockingly poor report			2
it is biased and inaccurate and several statements about @entity2 are just plain wrong			0
it is not a report by independent experts it is propaganda from a campaign group			0
' the report has created a theoretical ‘ ideal standard ’ against which it measures the schemes			0
their benchmark is totally unrealistic , in most cases not even the most expensive organic products meet them			0
the report has no regard for the cost of production and what shoppers can afford			0
it is no more realistic than a motoring report that suggests that everyone should buy a @entity252 , ' he added .			2

also allowed tethering of sheep and cattle and genetically modified animals
charity advises consumers to buy meat carrying the @entity35 or @entity36 logos which achieved high scores in their research
