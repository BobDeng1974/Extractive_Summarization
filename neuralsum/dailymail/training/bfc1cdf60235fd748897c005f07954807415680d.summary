@entity1 's attempts to follow compatriot @entity2 by scoring his own ' glove of @entity4 ' backfired as the @entity7 striker 's handball subterfuge was spotted , punished and left him public enemy number one at @entity10 's raucous @entity9			1
despite putting in a match - winning performance for his title - chasing side and his first goals since december 3 , @entity1 will be remembered for something other than an impressive return to form following a knee injury			2
true , he did n't try to con the referee with an over-the - top celebration as @entity2 did when he rose above @entity21 to score the first goal against @entity23 at the 1986 @entity24 with his palm			2
@entity1 ( 16 ) handled the ball into the net in similar fashion to fellow @entity29 the goal was disallowed by referee @entity31 and @entity1 became the target for boo 's from the @entity10 fans the @entity7 striker could have headed it in following good work from @entity38 but put the ball in with his hand @entity1 's goal was reminiscint of the ' hand of @entity4 ' goal scored by @entity45 compatriot @entity2 nevertheless , the striker did clearly use the fingers inside his gloved left hand for a final touch on a goal that would have put @entity7 2 - 1 ahead on the stroke of half - time			1
as @entity7 players loudly acclaimed the goal awarded by referee @entity31 , a sheepish @entity1 kept quiet as @entity10 players vented angry protests , particularly from @entity56 , the defender closest to the action			1
in the end , mr @entity31 was persuaded to consult with his assistant and having clearly gleaned the correct information , disallowed the goal			0
@entity10 's @entity62 ( left ) confronts @entity1 following the incident at the @entity9 the 26 - year - old ( 16 ) was then booked by @entity31 for his misdemeanor despite his arguments @entity1 was n't allowed to forget his indiscretion by the @entity10 fans , regarded as among the most partisan in the @entity70			2
when the whistle blew for half - time with the score still at 1 - 1 moments later , every step he took towards the dressing - room was greeted with widespread boos and the occasional howl of abuse			2
the odd thing is @entity1 did n't even need to handle to score			0
@entity38 's low cross flipped up in the air and @entity56 tried to intercept , @entity1 's first touch with his head was goalbound but only a yard from goal his left arm seemed to involuntarily move up and his hand gave the ball a final shove			2
presumably the forward will claim he could n't get his hand out the way but even so he will now go alongside other @entity95 greats @entity96 and @entity2			0
@entity38 and @entity1 celebrate his goal before realising the referee 's decision to disallow it of course , @entity1 's sleight of hand wo n't be remembered in 30 years time like @entity2 's because it was ruled out and did n't prove decisive in any case â€“ largely because he scored twice anyway			1
@entity1 had failed to find the net since returning from a knee injury sustained against @entity105 but a cold wednesday night in @entity10 proved the time to put the cobwebs away			0
@entity7 's goal to open the scoring after half - an - hour was brilliant			1
@entity1 outmuscled @entity56 on the halfway line to collect a punt from @entity112 , accelerated past @entity113 and shot cleanly across @entity114			0
@entity1 ( right ) was impressive throughout and scored a splendid double to help @entity7 to victory @entity117 then equalised with a trademark header past @entity119 to deservedly level the scoreline			1
@entity112 then headed the visitors in front and when @entity7 were awarded a penalty , @entity1 rifled it into the roof of the net for his 21st goal of the season			1
@entity10 fans might not like him but his own fans chanted ' @entity1 , @entity1 ' as he made way for @entity131 with the game won			0
the exciting thing for @entity7 is @entity1 can only get better with new signing @entity134 due to line up alongside him in their next game in 10 days time			0
@entity138 , who await in the @entity140 , will be worried			0
even without his hands , @entity1 is deadly			0
@entity117 scores a trademark header past the stranded @entity119 to level up the scores in the first half @entity112 celebrates after his goal regained the leader for the reigning @entity70 champions @entity1 scored his second goal from the spot after @entity38 was adjudged to have been brought down @entity150 celebrates with the away fans after his goal sealed the win for @entity154 's men			1

@entity1 's attempted the ' hand of *god* ' but the goal was disallowed
@entity2 succeeded when he scored against @entity23
the incident *overshadowed* an impressive performance from the @entity45 who scored a double in @entity7 's 4 - 1 win over @entity10
@entity112 and @entity150 scored the other @entity7 goals , while @entity117 headed home the equaliser in the first half
