@entity0 has been pitched into moral uproar after a female spectator was caught on camera cheering for a @entity0 football team			1
the woman , dressed in a black abaya robe and niqab face covering , is seen shouting in frustration at a bad tackle during a match between @entity0 's @entity10 and @entity12 ' @entity11			1
as she shakes her fist in anger at the unsportsmanlike behaviour on pitch , her sleeve rides up and exposes much of her lower arm			0
' women are n't interested in football , so why go to a stadium to watch a live match ? ' wrote one , in @entity45 comments translated by @entity46			2
' does this woman not have a man ? her place is in the house , ' pronounced another , echoing a general consensus that these women had ventured into a world where they do n't belong			2
women are banned from going to football matches in @entity0 , and had @entity10 been playing at their home stadium in the @entity0 capital , @entity60 , there is now way they could have attended			1
but the team were playing away at @entity11 's stadium in @entity63 , where laws are not so strict			2
the gender segregation laws in @entity0 , the world 's biggest oil producer and a key ally of the @entity69 , are based on a particularly extreme interpretation of @entity73 @entity72 law			1
the absolute monarchy is the only country in the world where women are legally banned from driving and , until recently , voting and being elected to political office			0
all females must have a male guardian , typically a father , brother or husband , without whose permission they ca n't travel , get a job , conduct official business like opening bank accounts , or even have certain medical procedures			0
laws are mostly unwritten , so the exclusively male judges have a lot of discretionary power which they usually exercise in favour of conservative tribal customs			0
according to local newspaper reports , the @entity0 government is considering modifying stadia with separate sections for women .			0

women are banned from going to football stadiums in @entity0
but this match was in @entity63 , where segregation laws are not so strict
online commenters *criticise* the woman saying ' her place is in the house '
