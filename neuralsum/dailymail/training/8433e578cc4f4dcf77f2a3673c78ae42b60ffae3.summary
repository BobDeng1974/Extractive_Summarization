the @entity0 is being urged to stop shooting and blowing up pigs for training in battlefield injuries by a group of leading vets			1
in an open letter to the government , the experts argue that the use of live pigs in military training exercises is ‘ morally wrong , educationally redundant and legally unsound ’			1
and they question the similarities between pig and human wounds , likening it to testing ‘ a drug for parrots on horses ’			0
training : the @entity0 has defended its involvement in the ' cruel ' practice of blowing up pigs animal rights groups have condemned the exercises and insisted modern alternatives could be found			2
but last month defence minister @entity25 insisted the animals were treated ‘ humanely ’ and nothing was as realistic as using the ‘ live pig models ’			1
official figures show 115 pigs have been killed to test if they could be saved after being injured in blasts			1
in one test a group of farm animals were put in body armour before being blown up at a military base in @entity38 , @entity39			1
the letter , seen by @entity41 , argues that civil society is ‘ willing to accept some forms of animal suffering , where the end justifies the means ’ but if the public knew there were viable alternatives to the use of live pigs it would ‘ no longer be tolerated ’			0
campaigner @entity53 said pigs and humans were too different for the tests to be useful to surgeons they cite the decision by the @entity0 to stop using live goats in submarine tests after pressure from mps and campaigners			1
the letter adds : ‘ as veterinary surgeons we are acutely aware of the concept of species differences			0
we would not test a drug for parrots on horses , so where is the logic in training human doctors on pigs ? ‘ we live in an age of evidence based medicine			2
the fact that pigs are “ similar ” to humans , because both are mammals and both bleed when blown up does not make the pig a predictive model of human outcome			2
’ they argue humans and pigs are separated by up to 97million years of evolution , and there are major differences in the way they bleed			2
some 95 percent of @entity96 and @entity97 test sites use lifelike human patient simulators instead of pigs , the letter adds			1
‘ pigs are a poor substitute for real life experience			1
@entity104 civilian and military surgeons have for years gained valuable real life experience by travelling outside the @entity104 and providing medical help where it is most needed , in exchange for their training			1
’ the letter has been organised by @entity53 , a @entity112 vet and director of @entity115 - based @entity114			0
according to latest figures , some 21 pigs were blown up in 2010 , 37 in 2011 and 57 in 2012			1
ministers insist the exercise are the only way to replicate the injuries soldiers sustain on the frontline , in order to give military medics training in how to treat horrific wounds			0
official figures show that more than 100 pigs have been blown up in @entity104 over a three - year period for research into battlefield injuries responding to a parliamentary question , mr @entity25 said : ‘ as a key element in their training for operational deployment , members of the @entity104 @entity133 attend military exercise surgical training courses in @entity138			1
‘ these exercises are essential to ensure our medical personnel are capable of carrying out potentially life - saving surgery on casualties with serious bullet and blast wounds			0
‘ injuries of such severity are not routinely encountered during their clinical practice in @entity150 hospitals , but they are regularly required to treat them when on operational deployment			0
participating in @entity138 training minimises the number of animals involved			0
‘ the pigs are treated humanely with full use of anaesthetics			2
there are a number of sophisticated simulation models on the market that provide effective training in certain surgical techniques , and the @entity0 already uses these where clinically appropriate			2
‘ however , none of those currently available provide a viable alternative to the serious bullet and blast wound training that our surgeons receive from live pig models			1
’ defence minister @entity25 has rejected calls for the tests to end , insisting the pigs are treated humanely dear @entity25 , we , the undersigned veterinary surgeons , are contacting you as defence minister to ask you to end the use of pigs in military training exercises and to replace them with readily available alternatives			1
we respectfully ask that you take into consideration the weight of the following moral , scientific , pedagogical and legal arguments against continuing this practice			0
the moral argument civil society is willing to accept some forms of animal suffering , where the “ end justifies the means ” and on the understanding that the higher the cost to the animal in terms of suffering , the greater the expected benefit to human well being			0
however , if the public is made aware that viable alternatives exist to the use of live pigs in military training exercises then this practice will no longer be tolerated , as happened in a similar case involving the @entity0 in 2008			2
after years of conducting experiments on goats to determine the effects of extreme pressure and the ‘ bends ’ on submarine crews , the @entity0 bowed to pressure from mps and animal protection campaigners and announced that these experiments would stop			0
the scientific argument as veterinary surgeons we are acutely aware of the concept of species differences			0
we would not test a drug for parrots on horses , so where is the logic in training human doctors on pigs ? we live in an age of evidence based medicine			2
the fact that pigs are ' similar ' to humans , because both are mammals and both bleed when blown up does not make the pig a predictive model of human outcome			0
pigs and humans differ in significant ways , for example : the pedagogical argument the use of live animals to teach and train military as well as civilian surgeons , as illustrated by courses in @entity250 ( @entity250 ) has long been surpassed by the use of non harmful , alternative techniques			1
the legal argument articles 4 , 13 and 47 of @entity255 on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes endorse the principle of ' replacement , reduction and refinement '			0
specifically , @entity264 4 states : ' @entity265 shall ensure that , wherever possible , a scientifically satisfactory method or testing strategy , not entailing the use of live animals , shall be used instead of a procedure			0
' the availability of non harmful alternatives to the use of pigs is now internationally recognised by bodies such as the @entity276 and considered as routine practice in many countries including the @entity96 , @entity97 , as well as the militaries of 23 of the @entity104 ’s 27 @entity281 allies			1
the use of live pigs in military training exercises is therefore , in our view , morally wrong , educationally redundant and legally unsound			1
it is high time the @entity0 ended the practice and instead focused on funding readily available , non-animal alternatives			0
yours sincerely , @entity290 ( @entity291 ) @entity292 @entity293 , @entity294 , @entity295 ( @entity291 ) mrcvs @entity296 ( @entity298 ) @entity299 ( @entity300 ) @entity301 ( @entity302 ) , @entity303 , @entity304 , @entity305 , @entity306 , @entity307 ( @entity302 ) @entity309 mrcvs @entity308 ( @entity310 ) @entity311 ( @entity312 ) , phd , @entity297 , @entity314			0

letter to @entity0 brands tests ' morally wrong and legally unsound '
115 pigs killed in 3 years to test if they could be saved after being injured
some put in body armour before being blown up at @entity39 military base
@entity328 figures show 21 pigs were blown up in 2010 , 37 in 2011 and 57 in 2012
but defence minister @entity25 insisted animals are treated ' humanely '
pigs and humans are separated by *79* - 97 million years of evolution
in pigs , **70** **%** of the blood volume is at or above the level of the heart . in humans , **70** **%** of the blood volume is below the level of the heart
blood *clotting* time differs in pigs and humans
the pig heart has a more *neuromyogenic* conduction **system** than the human
differences in gene *expression* between human and pig are *responsible* for *incompatibilities* in the blood *coagulation* **system**s
95 per cent of @entity96 and @entity97 *facilities* that provide @entity250 training use lifelike human patient simulators instead of pigs
the @entity363 was *evaluated* and approved by the @entity276 in 2001 as an alternative to live *non-human* models or *cadavers* for @entity250 , the leading @entity367 . the **system** is now used to train over *30,000* medical professionals each year . since its release , @entity363 has also become *widely* used in military courses
pigs are a poor substitute for real life experience . @entity104 civilian and military surgeons have for years gained valuable real life experience by travelling outside the @entity104 and providing medical help where it is most needed , in exchange for their training
