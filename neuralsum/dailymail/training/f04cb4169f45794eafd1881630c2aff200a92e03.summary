by @entity0 last updated at 8:36 am on 20th december 2011 @entity2 's comments last night have got the presenter in hot water again @entity2 is being investigated over his comments about striking public sector workers			1
the @entity8 presenter was forced to apologise after saying all striking workers ' should be shot '			1
tv watchdog @entity10 has now launched an investigation after the comments - made during @entity13 on november 30 - led to more than 21,000 complaints to the @entity15 and almost 800 to @entity10 itself			1
the watchdog is looking at whether he breached broadcasting rules on ' generally accepted standards '			2
' @entity10 has taken the decision to investigate comments made by @entity2 on @entity24 ’s @entity13 , ' it said			0
' we will make the outcome of the investigation known in due course			0
' the tv regulator is also investigating other comments @entity2 made on @entity13 describing people who kill themselves at railway stations as causing ' immense ' disruption to commuters			0
the remarks about strikers led to condemnation by union leaders and politicians			0
prime minister @entity40 branded @entity2 ’s comments as ' silly '			0
his gaffe came as he appeared on the @entity24 show on the evening of @entity45 ’s biggest public sector strikes for 30 years			0
speaking about the strikers , he said : ' i ’d have them all shot			2
i would take them outside and execute them in front of their families			0
' i mean , how dare they go on strike when they ’ve got these gilt - edged pensions that are going to be guaranteed while the rest of us have to work for a living ? ' @entity2 later said in a statement that his comments were not meant to have been taken seriously			2
controversial : @entity2 said he wanted to see strikers shot when he appeared on the one show last month awkward : presenters @entity65 and @entity67 squirmed as @entity2 made his comments on the live programme ' i did n’t for a moment intend these remarks to be taken seriously - as i believe is clear if they ’re seen in context , ' he said			2
' if the @entity15 and i have caused any offence , i ’m quite happy to apologise for it alongside them			1
' but in a later interview he appeared to be taking the matter less seriously , when he also apologised to sparrows , after saying he did not like them during @entity13			0
the @entity15 said the item ' was n’t perfectly judged '			1
earlier this year the @entity15 apologised about an item on @entity84 ’s @entity8 which led to the @entity86 ambassador complaining about the ' outrageous , vulgar and inexcusable insults ' made about @entity86 by @entity2 and co-hosts @entity88 and @entity90			1
the @entity15 ’s editorial complaints unit upheld criticisms of the show and ruled that it reinforced stereotypes			1
in february 2009 , @entity2 famously called then - prime minister @entity95 a ' one - eyed @entity97 idiot ' and in november the previous year , the @entity15 received almost 2,000 complaints when he joked about lorry drivers murdering prostitutes			1
