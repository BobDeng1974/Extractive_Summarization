by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 every @entity3 player can claim to have defied the odds as he strides on to the @entity6 pitch on saturday , but none more so than @entity8			1
not so long ago , @entity3 ’s former @entity10 midfielder was unsure he would be striding anywhere , after a challenge with @entity15 full back @entity13 left his career hanging in the balance			1
as he lay on the turf at the @entity20 in 2010 , medical staff had to administer oxygen before stretcher bearers were able to carry him off			2
‘ never mind kicking a ball , he told me i might never walk properly again , ’ @entity8 , 24 , reflected			1
the worst - case scenario was avoided after a gruelling nine - month rehabilitation , but he was left fretting over his future once more when the same knee buckled beneath him against @entity38 in 2011			2
again , he had to be carried off , and while the diagnosis proved less serious , it is little wonder he intends savouring every moment of @entity3 ’s attempt to upset favourites @entity44			1
‘ after the first one , i was told i might never walk properly again , so you can put that in context , alongside possibly playing in an @entity23 final , ’ he said			1
‘ i do n’t know yet whether i will be in the team , but to have the opportunity would be fantastic , just remarkable for me and my family			0
‘ it will be some day out , and i believe we are going to win it			0
it was 2010 and then 2011 , the injuries			0
a long time ago now , but you do n’t forget			0
‘ i made a right mess of my leg with the first one , and i knew i would n’t be right for a long time			2
the second one felt like someone had broken my fingernail , by comparison			0
back of the net : @entity8 scores against @entity65 in the @entity23 semi-final at @entity6 confident : @entity8 believes @entity3 have what it takes to beat @entity44 on saturday ‘ when you spend a total of 18 months out injured , it is never nice			1
just being able to train every day is something i relish and enjoy now , and when i look at a couple of players in our squad who have been out injured , i can sympathise with them			0
i know what you are going through			0
keep working hard , and with the physios here , who are top lads , you will get back			0
’ @entity8 went on to insist there was no malice in the incident involving @entity85 at @entity86 that could have cost him his @entity6 place			1
he trod on the @entity15 midfielder ’s shin but escaped punishment from the @entity23			1
‘ it could have been taken the wrong way , but it was an accident in the sense that it was clumsy from me , ’ he said			0
accident : @entity8 claims that he did n't mean to catch @entity15 winger @entity85 unlucky : @entity8 says @entity85 's speed was the reason he ended up standing on his leg at @entity86 ‘ i was tired , it was the 90th minute and @entity85 was too quick for me			1
my leg is in the air , he ’s kicked the ball away and as i ’m coming to plant my foot to push off , i ’ve ended up accidentally standing on him			2
‘ of course , there was worry and anxiety			0
sometimes things can be taken the wrong way or over the line , but it is all done and dusted now and i can look forward to the cup final			2
’ @entity8 knows what it is like to be on the end of a controversial incident ; he was the victim of @entity116 ’s headbutt earlier in the season			1
@entity116 apologised to @entity8 straight after the game and , he says , ‘ that was the end of it ’			2
forgotten : @entity8 has moved on after being headbutted by @entity121 boss @entity116 in march the 24 - year - old from @entity123 has blossomed under @entity3 manager @entity124			1
he described the sales pitch that persuaded him to follow manager @entity124 from @entity10 to @entity3 : ‘ when i spoke to him , he said , “ @entity8 , i want you to come and be a part of this ”			1
i said , “ how do i know you are going to be promoted ? ” so he just said , “ trust me , i will get this team promoted ”			0
‘ and within one year he did			0
you ’ve got to give him credit for that			2
it just goes to show what a great manager he is			0
