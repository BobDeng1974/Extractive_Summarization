saving soap : it was this scene from a 1990 episode of @entity6 where @entity22 is raped by @entity23 which made the young woman take notes and ensure she preserved dna following the attack following the supposed assault , the woman ensured she preserved dna evidence on her body and made detailed notes , inspired by an episode of the @entity35 soap where character @entity22 is raped by bar owner @entity23			1
‘ @entity22 had been raped by @entity23 and i remember watching the story , ' she told a jury at @entity39			1
‘ i knew i had not to have a shower or bath and i knew it was important to remember as much as i could			0
when i got home i decided to make notes of everything that happened , step - by - step , so it would help me remember when i spoke to police			2
’ @entity14 , previously of @entity49 , @entity18 , was extradited from @entity50 earlier this year after a specialist team executed a warrant at his @entity54 home , a jury was told			1
prosecutors claim he approached the woman at @entity57 on may 17 , 1990 , before brutally assaulting her in wasteland off @entity59 , in @entity18			1
attack : the then 20 - year - old was on her way home in may 1990 when she claims @entity14 dragged her from the @entity57 and brutally raped her speaking from behind a screen , the alleged victim told the court : ‘ i felt an arm around my neck			1
i thought it was something messing about because you do n’t think that something bad is going to happen to you			0
it was quite strong and i could n’t get out and that ’s when i realised it was n’t a joke			0
‘ i was just saying , ‘ please , no. please , stop it			0
i was crying and sobbing and struggling and i was really worried that i was going to get hurt			0
’ the jury was told that following the assault the woman ’s attacker told her : ‘ you must hate me , you must feel degraded			2
’ following the assault @entity14 is said to have covered his victim in her own coat , before threatening her towait ten minutes before contacting the ‘ boys in blue ’ so he could escape			1
@entity85 , prosecuting , said : ‘ the victim was first shocked , then terrified			2
she began to cry , to panic and to sob			0
the man told her he was going to make love to her , that she would like it			0

’ ’ the woman fled the scene and returned home before her husband discovered her wrapped in a duvet in the couple ’s living room , the court heard			0
her injuries were so severe that she vomited during a police interview and could not be examined by forensic scientists , it was said			0
case revived : following the cold case review in 2002 , alleged attacker @entity14 could be extradited from @entity50 and is now facing trial on rape charges at @entity39 over a decade later , advances in forensic science sparked a cold case review of the rape			1
in 2002 , dna evidence was checked against the national dna database where a match was discovered with @entity14 ’s two children			1
' scientific conclusions found that ‘ the prospect of anyone other than the defendant having the dna found at the time of the crime was one in a billion ’ , mr @entity85 said , adding : ‘ in short , it was [ @entity14 ] who left it there			1
’ @entity14 has admitted having sex with the woman but claims he lived a ‘ promiscuous lifestyle ’ and that the sex was consensual			1
mr @entity85 said : ‘ the defence here is that he and victim decided jointly to go have sex having met near to the @entity18 bus station			2
‘ the defendant says he had a promiscuous lifestyle at the time			0
as a result he can not now recall if they were already acquainted or if the victim decided she urgently wanted to have sex with him immediately upon meeting him that night			0
’ following the attack the victim helped create a ‘ rather accurate ’ artist ’s impression in a bid to catch her attacker , the court was told			2
@entity14 denies rape , attempted buggery and indecent assault			2
