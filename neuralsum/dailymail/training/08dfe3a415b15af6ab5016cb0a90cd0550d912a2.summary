animal rights group @entity0 has released a distressing video that it says shows animals that it claims have been driven ' insane ' while living in captivity			1
with the release of behind - the - scenes footage of captive animals the organisation is urging the public to boycott circuses and zoos			1
' @entity13 ' is defined as a psychological condition of animals kept in circuses and zoos			0
@entity0 has released an eye - opening video of several animals in captivity apparently suffering from ' zoochosis ' symptoms are said to include pacing , circling , swaying , and even self - injury , caused by deprivation , loneliness , stress , desperation and insanity			1
the video shows clips of several animals in fragile psychological states , including a bear repeatedly walking in circles in a zoo , elephants swaying while housed in what looks like a barn , and a monkey engaging in self - harm			1
' even the best artificial environments ca n't come close to matching the space , diversity , and freedom that animals have in their natural habitats , ' a statement on @entity0 's website reads			0
' this deprivation - combined with relentless boredom , loneliness , stress , and sometimes even abuse , causes many captive animals to lose their minds			0
' ' @entity54 ' is a psychological condition caused by deprivation experienced by animals kept in confinement @entity0 adds : ' @entity13 is so rampant that some zoos even resort to administering mind - altering drugs such as @entity62 to address the public 's complaints about abnormal behaviours			1
' and , in circuses , the organisation asserts that the treatment of animals may be even more concerning			0
it claims circuses are not subject to any sort of treatment guidelines while training the animals because ' no government agency monitors training sessions			0
' symptoms of the condition include swaying , self - harm and walking in circles , like this bear moreover , circuses often adhere to extensive travel schedules and as such , the animals spend a great deal of time confined to trucks and trailers in between shows			2
@entity0 points to examples of animals who have injured themselves - and often , others - while attempting to escape from zoo pens or circus travel cages			0
according to @entity0 : ' the living conditions at zoos , circuses , and other animal exhibits are often dismal , with animals confined to tiny , filthy , barren enclosures that ca n't come anywhere close to matching the space , diversity , and freedom that animals enjoy in their natural habitat			2
' ' even the best artificial environments ca n't come close to their natural habitats , ' @entity0 's website reads here , a bear attempts to escape from his enclosure by biting and chewing on the wire fence countries such as @entity115 , @entity116 , @entity117 , @entity118 and @entity119 have recently implemented bans on wild - animal acts in circuses			2
and in the @entity125 , 94 per cent of respondents to a 2011 government consultation made clear that they wanted to see wild animal circuses banned entirely			1
as of now , 27 countries have bans on animal circuses and the @entity125 could soon follow			2
' animals are n't actors , ' says @entity0 's website , ' and yet thousands are forced to perform in zoos and circuses around the world every day			0

animal rights organisation implores public to avoid circuses and zoos
footage features zoo animals swaying , walking in circles , and self - harming
' this deprivation causes animals to lose their minds , ' says @entity0
in the @entity125 , wild animal circuses will be banned completely *beginning* in 2015
