former @entity1 striker @entity0 has hit out at @entity4 's @entity3 tactics and branded the @entity6 's group stage exit in @entity7 a ' humiliation '			1
@entity0 , who played in four major tournaments for @entity1 , believes that @entity4 's decision to play 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 instead of 4 - 3 - 3 was naive due to his side 's lack of experience			1
@entity15 's inability to organise and lead the side correctly also contributed to @entity1 's first group stage exit since 1958 , according to @entity18			2
the 53 - year - old @entity27 presenter told @entity39 : ' personally , i think @entity4 got it wrong			2
' the system that suits this kind of @entity1 better , with the lack of experience in it , is probably a 4 - 3 - 3			2
he tried to just play with two players in the centre of midfield			0
' in the first game i thought it was better because he had ( @entity55 ) @entity54 behind ( @entity57 ) @entity56 , and that gave us three because @entity54 is more of a natural midfield player , certainly than ( @entity62 ) @entity61			0
' but i just think it is too big an ask for just two central midfield players and once again we were outnumbered			0
' the problem with this 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 is that it very quickly becomes a 4 - 4 - 2 or at least a 4 - 4 - 1 - 1 and we end up with flat lines and people getting between us			1
clinical : @entity15 's failed clearance allowed @entity70 to bag the winner in @entity73 's 2 - 1 victory poor : @entity0 does not believe @entity15 ( centre ) has the organisational skills to lead an international midfield ' i think we would have been better - and i said this before the tournament - with three midfield players because you 've got to give yourself a chance defensively			1
' although he was heavily critical of @entity4 's tactics , @entity0 did say that he was pleased the @entity1 manager blooded some youngsters in tournament conditions			1
' you admire him ( @entity4 ) in many ways for giving youngsters a chance , ' he said			2
' i applaud the fact that he had a go and that 's what we all asked for was n't it , that he played faster , positive football , so we ca n't complain too much			0
' while calling @entity1 's exit a ' humiliation ' , @entity0 criticised @entity15 's ' individual ' attitude and his lack or organisational skills			1
@entity0 , who scored 48 goals in 80 internationals , believes @entity1 's ' old guard ' of @entity15 and @entity105 are ' past their best '			1
he said : ' @entity15 , wonderful player that he is , has always been an individual in many ways			0
devastated : @entity15 and @entity1 's ' old guard ' are ' past their best ' in @entity18 's opinion positive : blooding youngsters like @entity54 ( left ) was the only plus point , says @entity0 ' he 's not really a player that can organise or spot problems			2
he did n't spot the danger on @entity1 's left side in the first game , which was pretty obvious after a few attempts			0
' we do n't have the players who can spot something and deal with it			0
in my era we had @entity126 , @entity127 and @entity129 - players who could spot problems on the pitch and that is something that is missing from this crop			0
' in reference to @entity15 's failed headed clearance that led to @entity70 's winner against @entity1 in the 2 - 1 loss to @entity73 , @entity0 added : ' it was a schoolboy error that saw @entity1 finally go home with that dreadful second goal for @entity70			1
' defensively we were not good enough			0
' it was always the fear before the tournament that we were lightweight at the back with little depth , neither of the full - backs were defensively - minded full - backs			0
' finisher : @entity0 scored 48 goals in 80 internationals for @entity1 and played at four major tournaments @entity153 to take time over retirement decision			1

@entity0 said @entity4 's decision to play 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 and not 4 - 3 - 3 cost @entity1
that decision caused @entity1 to be *over-run* in centre of midfield , he says
he was also heavily critical of @entity15 's organisational skills
the ' old guard ' of @entity15 and @entity105 are ' past their best ' , he says
*ex-england* striker said only positive was giving the youngsters ' a chance '
@entity0 scored 48 goals in 80 international appearances for @entity1
