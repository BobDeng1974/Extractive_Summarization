by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 07:09 est , 31 july 2013 updated : 18:37 est , 31 july 2013 the daughter of singer @entity3 was arrested at anti-fracking protests yesterday as ministers warned the @entity6 could become ‘ the second biggest area of shale in @entity9 ’			1
environmental activist @entity10 , 30 , had ‘ superglued ’ herself to the entrance of a rural drilling site earmarked for potential fracking in @entity14			1
the site in @entity16 has become a focal point for communities concerned about the process			1
but yesterday energy minister @entity20 said that ‘ towns , villages and countryside ’ could all be targeted for drilling if gas were discovered , no matter their location or beauty			2
determined : @entity10 superglued herself to @entity31 ' @entity30 ' @entity29 to create a ' human lock ' by the gate to the proposed drilling entrance removed : ms @entity3 and her partner mr @entity29 were arrested following the stunt at a protest against fracking planned for a site in @entity16 , @entity14 so far , 25 protesters have been held by police in @entity16			1
arrested alongside miss @entity3 – the daughter of the @entity42 ’ @entity44 and the @entity45 ’ frontwoman – was her boyfriend , veteran eco-warrior @entity29 , 55			1
they had glued their hands together in a ‘ human lock ’ by the gate to the proposed drilling entrance at around 8.30am			1
a row of police officers acted as a human shield to hold back protesters while negotiating with the pair for over two hours			2
the couple were eventually freed by officers using glue thinner			0
the couple had set up camp opposite the main entrance to the gate , and had been staying in a small blue tent since the start of the protest a week ago			0
one activist said their decision to glue themselves together had been made on impulse			0
he said : ‘ for a moment there was no police officer at the gate and they took the opportunity to jump in there and glue themselves together			0
’ rock star : @entity3 of @entity45 activism : the daughter of two chart - toppers , ms @entity3 's own passion appears to lie in environmental activism controversy : the protest has been ongoing at the village in @entity14 for the past week the campaign comes as officers warned such protests are putting a strain on police resources and forcing them to delay other operations			1
fracking involves pumping liquid at high pressure deep underground to split shale rock and release gas for use as fuel			0
mr @entity20 warned the village would not be the only site in the @entity6 that could see drilling , if the country is to benefit from a gas bonanza			2
in response to comments by @entity116 peer @entity114 – father - in - law of chancellor @entity109 – that fracking should be concentrated in the ‘ desolate ’ @entity110 of @entity111 , the minister said : ‘ it can not be right to confine it to areas of the industrial @entity110			1
furore : police worked to free the pair at the protest site , where large teams of officers have been deployed for the past week anger : protestors have been gathered at the site for a week to protest against @entity129 's exploratory drilling activities strength of feeling : the anti-fracking activists staged a fake ' death ' at the rural spot in @entity14 today @entity135 exists under towns , villages and countryside			1
shale gas is everywhere and could well be in quantity under attractive areas of the country as well as industrial areas			0
’ he added the @entity6 could become ‘ the second biggest area of shale in @entity9 ’ and communities could benefit financially as a result			0
in june , a @entity149 claimed there may be more than 1,300 trillion cubic feet of shale gas under the @entity110 alone			2
passionate : ms @entity3 said she was ' okay ' as she was led to a police van industry experts claim even if 10 per cent is recovered – more than all of the gas produced from the @entity157 – it will be enough to power @entity9 for 50 years.now a similar study is being carried out in the @entity6 , with results expected next spring			1
‘ the same survey is now being done of the southern base , roughly from @entity162 through @entity163 , @entity164 , @entity165 and @entity166 , ’ mr @entity20 said			0
‘ we will know in march whether there is much more there than was originally thought			0
’ @entity16 , which has been selected for exploratory drilling by fracking company @entity129 , has attracted a growing number of protesters attempting to block equipment from being taken on site			1
despite this , the firm ’s boss predicted drilling could begin as soon as today			0
although he said he had ‘ no intention of ruining the countryside ’ , he side - stepped questions about whether fracking would take place close to people ’s homes , adding ‘ we would have to do it in a regulated fashion ’			0
campaigners who have turned up to the @entity14 site include @entity191 and former @entity194 model @entity192			2
miss @entity3 and mr @entity29 were still in custody last night			0
' do n't frack my future ' : former page 3 girl @entity192 was led away from the site by police earlier this week sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			2
