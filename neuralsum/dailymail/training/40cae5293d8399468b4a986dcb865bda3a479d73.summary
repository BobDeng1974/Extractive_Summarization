this is not a drill			0
the first real polar vortex of the season is expected to hit the @entity4 in full force thursday and friday , bringing a blast of arctic air capable of setting all - time february temperature lows from the @entity9 to @entity10			1
the polar vortex is a usually rare phenomenon whereby air circling the @entity14 is pushed down into @entity15			1
last year , the @entity4 experienced just two instances of polar vortex , but they were such scarring experiences that the term was floated around for any bout of cold weather the entire season			1
but this time it 's back for real			0
a polar vortex system has been moving down from the @entity14 all week and has already arrived in parts of the @entity25			2
it 's back : just when you thought it could n't get any colder : a polar vortex system will blow in from the @entity14 on thursday to bring record low temperatures to much of the eastern @entity32 long winter : the northeastern @entity32 - especially @entity33 , @entity34 - have been struggling to keep up with a constant barrage of snow			1
@entity37 in @entity38 is pictured partially frozen over on tuesday by thursday morning , the system will move further south into @entity40 and the western @entity41			2
@entity42 is expected to receive the brunt of the frigid weather , with temperatures likely to dip 40 degree below normal			0
meanwhile , @entity47 has n't experienced below zero temperatures for february 19 since 1994 , and the vortex is expected to break that lull as well			2
temperatures in the capital have been hovering in the teens lately , leading the @entity54 to freeze over			0
but the vortex is saving the worst of it 's punch for friday , when sub-zero temperatures will wipe the region from @entity60 to @entity10 and up into the @entity41			1
@entity61 : the polar vortex is expected to break records in @entity47 on both thursday and friday			1
above , visitors to the capital 's @entity65 walk through snow on tuesday eye of the cold : the arctic blast is expected to start thursday and hit the states of @entity42 , @entity10 , @entity60 and @entity72 the hardest no tgif : the worst of the polar vortex will be reserved for friday , when most of the @entity25 is expected to shiver in sub-zero temperatures @entity78 , @entity79 , southern @entity60 , @entity42 , @entity10 and far western @entity72 are forecasting morning lows of minus 20 degrees			1
meanwhile the @entity81 predicts that @entity82 , @entity60 ; @entity83 , @entity84 ; @entity85 , @entity10 and @entity86 , @entity10 will also break temperature records for that day			0
the low temperature record for @entity47 for february 20 was set all the way back in 1896 , with 8 - degrees but that should be easily quashed			2
adding to the pain will be windy conditions , with wind chill warnings issued across most of the @entity32 @entity96 climatologist @entity95 described the vortex as ' essentially the coolest air found in the @entity99 '			0
' it 's situated up in the @entity101 in the bulk of the winter			0
but occasionally , a lobe of that will dip south above the jet stream and allow that cold air down into the @entity41 states , ' @entity95 explained to @entity109			2
@entity4 dwellers will remember their old nemesis well			0
last year , the polar vortex caused wide - spread drops in temperature , several feet of snow , and the associated chaos of power outages , cancelled flights , and school closures			1

blast of @entity101 air to bring record - breaking low temperatures to @entity40 and the @entity41 on thursday and friday
sub-zero temperatures expected in @entity47 on thursday for the first time since 1994
polar vortex is caused by the *atmospheric* push of air above the @entity141 down into @entity15
last year the @entity4 experienced two bouts of polar vortex , which led to thousands of cancelled flights and school closures
