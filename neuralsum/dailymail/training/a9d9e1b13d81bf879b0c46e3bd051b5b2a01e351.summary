by @entity0 published : 15:12 est , 11 march 2013 updated : 15:12 est , 11 march 2013 people who have difficulty sleeping may be showing early symptoms of alzheimer 's disease , a new study has warned			2
researchers found sleep is disrupted in people who are likely have early alzheimer 's disease but do not yet have the memory loss or other cognitive problems characteristic of the full - blown disease			1
the finding confirms earlier observations by some of the same researchers			0
those studies showed a link in mice between sleep loss and brain plaques , a hallmark of alzheimer 's disease			1
sleep problems can be an earlier indicator of alzheimer 's disease than symptoms such as memory loss early evidence tentatively suggests the connection may work in both directions : @entity29 's plaques disrupt sleep , and lack of sleep promotes @entity29 's plaques			1
senior author professor @entity34 , head of @entity36 's @entity35 in the @entity37 , said : ' this link may provide us with an easily detectable sign of @entity29 's pathology			1
' as we start to treat people who have markers of early @entity29 , changes in sleep in response to treatments may serve as an indicator of whether the new treatments are succeeding			1
" sleep problems are common in people who have symptomatic alzheimer 's disease , but scientists recently have begun to suspect that they also may be an indicator of early disease			1
the new paper is among the first to connect early alzheimer 's disease and sleep disruption in humans			2
for the new study , researchers recruited 145 volunteers from the @entity36 's @entity60			0
previous research has shown a link between sleep loss and brain plaques , a hallmark of @entity29 's disease all of the volunteers were 45 to 75 - years - old and cognitively normal when they enrolled			1
as a part of other research at the centre , scientists had already analysed samples of the volunteers ' spinal fluids for markers of alzheimer 's disease			0
the samples showed that 32 participants had preclinical alzheimer 's disease , meaning they were likely to have amyloid plaques present in their brains but were not yet cognitively impaired			2
participants kept daily sleep diaries for two weeks , noting the time they went to bed and got up , the number of naps taken on the previous day , and other sleep - related information			0
the researchers tracked the participants ' activity levels using sensors worn on the wrist that detected the wearer 's movements			0
lead study author @entity95 , assistant professor of neurology , said : ' most people do n't move when they 're asleep , and we developed a way to use the data we collected as a marker for whether a person was asleep or awake			0
' this let us assess sleep efficiency , which is a measure of how much time in bed is spent asleep			0
' participants who had preclinical alzheimer 's disease had poorer sleep efficiency ( 80.4 per cent ) than people without markers of @entity29 's ( 83.7 per cent )			1
on average , those with preclinical disease were in bed as long as other participants , but they spent less time asleep			0
they also napped more often			0
dr @entity95 added : ' when we looked specifically at the worst sleepers , those with a sleep efficiency lower than 75 per cent , they were more than five times more likely to have preclinical alzheimer 's disease than good sleepers			2
' now dr @entity95 and her colleagues are following up with studies in younger participants who have sleep disorders she said : ' we think this may help us get a better feel for the way this connection flows - does sleep loss drive @entity29 , does @entity29 's lead to sleep loss , or is it a combination ? ' that will help us determine whether we can change the course of disease with pharmaceuticals or other treatments			1
' the findings were published in the journal @entity143 .			0

sleep problems can be an earlier indicator of the disease than memory loss
researchers say effect can go both ways : @entity29 's plaques in the brain disrupt sleep , and a lack of sleep promotes @entity29 's plaques
those with early signs of the disease got less sleep , but napped more often
