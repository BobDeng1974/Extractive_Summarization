by @entity1 reporter published : 07:15 est , 9 october 2012 updated : 08:35 est , 9 october 2012 two pensioners have had time called on their trips to a south @entity6 pub - until they have a wash			1
the @entity8 used to be the regular monday night watering hole for @entity10 and @entity11 , as the pair had been drinking there for about a year			1
this came to an abrupt end after the pub 's manager said he had received several complaints about the personal hygiene of one of the men			1
disappointed : @entity10 ( left ) and @entity11 ( right ) who were regulars at the @entity8 before being banned for bad hygiene both men were told they could not return to the pub until they addressed the issue			1
mr @entity10 , 67 , said : ' he practically said we stank			2
it â€™s a bit of a cheek and a bit of an insult			0
nobody had ever complained before and we had never had any problems with that pub before			2
' his 69 - year - old friend mr @entity11 added : ' it is not really good enough because i can not see how he can accept us the previous monday but then the following monday he says that to us			2
' i find it an insult and defamation of character			0
i was shocked when this happened , it is not a nice thing to have happen			0
' @entity47 , owner of the pub in @entity49 , south @entity6 , says mr @entity10 and mr @entity11 are both good customers and his staff tried to deal with the issue as sensitively as they could			1
out : the manager of @entity8 said he had received several complaints about one of the men 's hygiene he said : ' the manager spoke to the two guys outside and did not embarrass them in front of customers			1
' we do not wish to exclude people from the premises and all that was said is you must try and do something about your personal hygiene			0
' we are not barring them but they need to do something about their personal hygiene and then they will be welcome back in the pub. ' we like the customers we have got to be happy in the setting that we provide			0
' however , the offended pair have taken their custom elsewhere			0
the two pensioners have since started drinking in another pub on monday nights and visit other pubs in the area , including the @entity86 .			0
