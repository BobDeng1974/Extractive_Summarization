by @entity0 published : 01:59 est , 20 december 2012 updated : 11:46 est , 20 december 2012 when children ’s author @entity2 dreamed up the character of @entity5 at the start of the 20th century , she placed him in the setting she knew best - the villages and landscape of her beloved @entity11 home			1
now , 110 years after the first @entity5 book was published , animators have gone back to the @entity11 , to create a new adaptation as close to @entity2 ’s vision as possible			1
the new @entity17 animation , to be screened on @entity18 this afternoon is based on 3,500 photographs of the landscape around @entity2 ’s village of @entity22			1
re-animated : the new @entity17 animated version of @entity2 's @entity5 will premiere on @entity18 today original inspiration : using 3,500 photographs animators have tried to come as close to ms @entity2 's vision as possible - this tree inspired @entity5 's @entity28 coming to life : the animated version of @entity5 's world , including his @entity28 , have been inspired by the village on which @entity2 based her books the team - producers @entity34 and animators @entity37 - studied the @entity11 ’s forests , grassy hilltops , farmyards and woodland lanes			1
they photographed everything , started drawing sketches , working in the characters and their homes , and turned them into an animated world that is strikingly close to the real @entity50 landscape			0
the animated designs of @entity5 ’s burrow are based on a photograph of a gnarled tree on the banks of nearby @entity56 - with an added green door			0
mrs @entity58 is set at the base of a stony outcrop on fells near @entity2 ’s village			2
true life : this outcrop close to the village of @entity22 where @entity2 lived became the base for mrs @entity58 's laundry stage two : after studying the photographs for inspiration the animators began to sketch the scenes and dwellings for the new series last stop : the final animation for mrs @entity58 for the latest adaption of the classic children 's book and mr @entity82 ’s lair is placed in a pile of twigs and branches , built around a mossy tree stump in woods close to @entity22			1
the homes of the other characters are set in real buildings and farms from the area			0
the special one - off @entity94 episode will be shown at 4.30pm today with a full series to follow in the @entity96			0
coming to life : it may look like a mossy tree stump to most people , but to the animators this was the natural choice for @entity103 @entity105 dwelling : based on the tree - stump , mr @entity106 began to take shape final result : @entity103 as it will look on the small screen premiere on @entity18 later today the episodes will revolve around @entity5 and his loyal friend @entity112 , and the producers have added a new character - inquisitive , independent @entity114			2
@entity116 , controller at @entity18 said : ‘ i grew up with these books and so i am delighted to welcome this heritage brand to @entity18			0
‘ this witty , exciting and action - packed realisation is true to the original work of @entity2 and we believe it will have a huge appeal for the older end of our audience			0
