by @entity1 reporter published : 00:57 est , 26 october 2013 updated : 00:57 est , 26 october 2013 matching mother - daughter @entity4 costumes can often be charming , cute , or both			1
but they can also be considered downright offensive , especially if the matching costume is ' white trash , ' and it 's worn to an elementary school @entity4 event			1
a mother - daughter duo in metro @entity14 did exactly that - and the reaction from parents and students were probably not what they had in mind			1
the pair wore their costumes to @entity24 's ' @entity23 ' @entity4 celebration in @entity26 on thursday evening			0
' white trash ' : this ' white trash ' @entity4 costume has irked some parents at a @entity32 elementary school to become ' white trash , ' the pair simply donned plain white trash bags - over black sweatshirts - with the words ' white trash ' scrawled on them			2
additionally , they painted their faces white with a smeared coat of black paint near their eyes			0
' i was a little appalled			0
to me , how can you dress yourself and your child in a white trash outfit ? ' parent @entity46 said to @entity50			2
the area where the school is located is a suffering economically like much of the rest of the city of @entity14 , which recently declared bankruptcy			1
this has added even more fuel to the outrage of parents at the school , as the offensive slur ' white trash ' has often crept its way into the area			1
offensive : one parent said she was appalled that the pair would wear such an offensive @entity4 costume ' @entity26 is known for " white trash " and you just do n't do that at a kids function , ' says mom @entity73			0
' you ca n't have weapons ; you ca n't have blood ; you ca n't have gory stuff , but racial slurs ? go right ahead ! ' one person , however , did n't understand what all the fuss is about			0
' i do n't get offended easily , ' @entity81 told the station			0
' there 's more important things in this world right now - people are out of jobs , people are homeless and not eating			0
' the school 's principal said he confronted the mother about the costume , but noted that it 's hard to make parents abide by the same rules as the students			1
@entity14 : one mother said this section of @entity14 is often called ' white trash , ' making the costume even more offensive last week , the @entity102 told students to not wear @entity4 costumes that it deemed offensive , or to be a ' crude stereotype			1
' on the list are cowboys , @entity108 , anything with a sombrero , anything ' ghetto ' and anything ' white trash			0
' ' making the choice to dress up as someone from another culture , either with the intention of being humorous or without the intention of being disrespectful , can lead to inaccurate and hurtful portrayals of other people 's cultures , ' @entity116 @entity115 wrote in a letter to students .			2

parents ' appalled ' that the mother would dress her daughter in such an offensive outfit
the school is in a town in metro @entity14 , where one mother said the slur is frequently used to describe the *residents*
the principal of the school said he spoke to the mother , but notes that it 's hard to get parents to abide by the same rules students
