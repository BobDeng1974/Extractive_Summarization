there was torrential rain in @entity2 , a goal by @entity4 and the collapse of @entity7 ’s painfully fragile defensive unit			1
stop me if you ’ve heard it before			0
five days after his team surrendered a 3 - 0 lead in @entity14 against @entity15 , @entity16 saw another lead washed away			1
only these lost points will perhaps prove even more damaging as defeat leaves @entity7 trailing a dozen points behind @entity22 pacesetters @entity23			1
@entity4 's ( left ) goal was as good as it got for @entity7 on a miserable afternoon in @entity25 what a weekend it has been for @entity27 and how @entity16 must wonder if it would have been better to bid farewell in the afterglow of an @entity32 win at @entity33			1
his side struggle with familiar problems : the inability to defend a lead and the character to resist setbacks			2
two clean sheets have been followed by two lost leads			0
for every step or two forward there is one back			0
the squad lacks depth in defence and the back four is being held together with sticking plaster			0
regardless , @entity16 maintains his footballing principles			2
as the @entity22 breaks for international football , 11 games into the campaign , @entity7 feel too far off the pace			1
they are a point behind @entity2 , who responded brilliantly after going behind in the 63rd minute			2
@entity58 ’s side were behind for 12 minutes before @entity59 levelled with a superb free - kick and @entity61 scored in the winner , his first in the @entity22 , seconds after coming on to replace @entity63			1
@entity2 midfielder @entity64 ( right ) , seen battling with @entity65 , impressed for the hosts @entity2 survived a chaotic finish and a desperate penalty appeal when a header from @entity70 skidded into @entity72 ’s arm and , without injured wingers @entity74 and @entity75 and with @entity76 suspended , they deserved their win			2
how they celebrated at the end , no - one more so than former @entity7 duo : goalkeeper @entity81 and centre back @entity82 , starting his first @entity22 game of the season			1
@entity7 have won just four @entity22 matches this season and those have come against teams currently in the bottom seven of the table			1
for an hour it had been a tense struggle , littered by fouls , cautions and treatment for injuries , contrary to expectations from two fluent passing teams			0
@entity2 had started well , @entity7 fought back and , ultimately , @entity16 ’s team paid the price again for their inability to close ranks and protect a lead			1
@entity101 winger @entity64 tormented @entity102 , who has the look of a talented teenager in need of a break			0
@entity64 was too quick and direct for @entity107 and created the winner with a burst of acceleration down the left wing and a perfect cross for @entity61 to head in			2
@entity59 ( left ) curls in a superb free - kick for @entity2 's equaliser against the @entity116 @entity59 is congratulated by @entity82 ( left ) and @entity64 ( right ) after his equalising goal @entity58 was rewarded for refusing to flinch			1
@entity61 was stripped and ready to come on when @entity59 curled his free - kick over the defensive wall and into the top corner from 25 yards , beyond the dive of @entity122			1
@entity16 disputed the free - kick but it was awarded after a cynical trip by @entity126 to halt a swift counter-attack by @entity128 , a @entity129 striker			1
@entity58 went for the kill rather than attempt to protect the point			0
@entity132 went @entity61 as planned and he had scored within seconds , after winning the ball and linking in with his midfield			1
play was swept out to the @entity2 left , where @entity64 tore past @entity107 and clipped an inviting cross towards @entity61 , who climbed above @entity138 and @entity139 to thump his header inside the post			1
@entity7 had been 15 minutes from victory but were rarely comfortable and it is hard to escape the feeling that @entity2 ’s refusal to give up was motivated at least in part by the fact @entity16 ’s team are so brittle			1
they can be got at			0
it is not a new theory but there is , it seems , a psychological weakness within a superbly gifted team , and it is costing them in the toughest competitions			0
@entity61 rises to the occasion by leaping above the @entity7 defenders and powering a header into the net @entity58 felt his team should have had an early penalty when @entity107 barged into @entity63 as the @entity164 controlled a ball on his chest			1
@entity63 fell in a heap and there was exaggerated disbelief inside the @entity170 as referee @entity171 ignored calls for a foul			0
it was the sort of reaction commonly found at the @entity176 , but @entity177 has generated a similar feeling in @entity179 , after an extended public whinge about poor decisions costing his team			0
@entity122 saved from @entity183 , but @entity7 grew stronger as the first half progressed and their best moments revolved around @entity186 , and his desire to run at defenders			1
@entity72 and @entity189 were cautioned for fouls on him and @entity171 ’s yellow card count was in double figures by the end			0
@entity16 looks far from happy at the final whistle after seeing his @entity7 side surrender their lead the top six in the @entity22 , with @entity2 leapfrogging @entity7 into fifth after their 2 - 1 win on sunday @entity81 thwarted @entity198 , @entity138 lashed a volley close and @entity200 beat @entity82 to a corner only to head wide			1
the @entity203 goalkeeper , who left @entity7 after winning the @entity32 in may , also saved a skiddy drive by @entity65 — but was unable to keep @entity4 at bay			1
@entity186 broke out of defence , rode an attempted trip by @entity208 and found @entity65			0
he released @entity198 who pulled his cross deep to @entity4			0
the @entity211 swept the ball into the net			0
it was his 12th in 14 games , but that is not where @entity16 has problems			2
it is at the other end , where it always has been			0
the heavens opened and @entity7 went under			2
@entity223 by @entity225 - @entity224 1			0
he ’s played in 20 games this season and let @entity64 — the 25 - year - old @entity230 winger , who joined @entity2 for £ 4m in july — dominate the flank			1
@entity102 had a torrid afternoon up against @entity2 winger @entity64 2			2
since @entity58 ’s rant about bad refereeing , @entity234 ’s red card was rescinded , a clear penalty was n’t given at @entity238 , and it appeared @entity63 was also denied one yesterday			0
@entity138 is still showing wonderful incision , but his tally of two goals is four down on this stage last season			2
@entity16 ’s demeanour has also suggested some frustration at the player			0
@entity138 has struggled to recapture his form from last season for @entity7 so far this term 4			2
so much for a pass-fest			0
two of the most eye - catching sides in the division were involved in a fierce battle , managing 26 fouls and five bookings apiece .			0

@entity7 lost from a winning position for the second *consecutive* game
@entity16 's side surrendered a one - goal lead against @entity2 on sunday as they fell to their second @entity22 defeat of the season
the @entity116 *makeshift* defence was exposed during the second half
goals from @entity59 and @entity61 moves the @entity272 up to fifth in the table , ahead of the @entity116
