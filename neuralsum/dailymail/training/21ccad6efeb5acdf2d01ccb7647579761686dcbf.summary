he told the @entity80 that the force hopes to save around £ 6.5million per year by moving to a smaller hq			1
' it 's an expensive building to run and it 's an expensive building to maintain and as we go through this change programme it 's going to have space in it that we do n't need			2

' it 's very regrettable that it 's come to this , ' he said			0
' clearly it 's a building of age and it 's got upkeep costs , but the old police authority and now @entity111 have had a consistent policy of selling off property and they 've now reached the @entity103			1
' an iconic building like @entity2 is going to bite the dust			1
' the mayor needs to look at his own office			0
he sits in a brand new building on the @entity120 - why does n't he sell that to save money ? thousands of people work at @entity2 and it seems to me that there will be a lot of incremental costs to relocate people			1
' he said there had already been significant investment to refurbish the building , and the sale would be another knock to officers ' morale			2
while @entity4 bosses have stressed that , despite the cuts , there will be more constables in the capital than ever - 25,000 - mr @entity100 said numbers of more senior ranks will be @entity146 said : ' the mayor has pledged to maintain numbers at about 32,000 but you balance that against cuts , for example 20 per cent budget cuts , then something has got to give and it 's going to be sergeants and above , right to the top			1
' we have grave concerns around the supervisory ranks that we represent - sergeant , inspector and chief inspector			0
' the people who are left are going to be severely challenged , because , to be frank , some of them ca n't do all of their job now			0
there are only so many hours in the day			0

it 's a bit of a kick in the teeth , ' mr @entity100 said			0

however senior officers are pledging to open three new ' access points ' or front counters for every station they shut			0
these could be desks in community centres or supermarkets which would be open to the public at set times of the day			0
the @entity4 and the mayor are committed to keeping at least one station per borough which is open round the clock			2

' our busiest gets around 100 visitors per day , our quietest on a good day gets two			0
' going forward with the financial pressures we face , it ca n't make economic sense to keep a building open on the off - chance that someone might pop in a couple of times per week			0
' the cost of the counters varies from £ 70 per visit down to around £ 10 per visit , he said			0
