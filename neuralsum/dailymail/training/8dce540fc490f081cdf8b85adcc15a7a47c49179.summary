a domed helmet , thick boots and overalls coated in a special plastic			1
this is the suit designed to keep @entity6 medics free from @entity7 , as they head for parts of @entity9 ravaged by the disease			1
the first wave of @entity13 volunteers were deployed by the government this weekend			1
they were sent to @entity16 to join the global effort to control the epidemic			1
the group of 30 volunteers is made up of @entity21 , nurses , psychiatrists and emergency medicine consultants			0
most of the suit will be burnt after being used to stop the virus spreading barrier : @entity6 medics join other health workers fighting @entity7 in @entity9			1
pictured is a @entity36 ( @entity36 ) , health worker in protective gear , including a face mask , lightweight overalls and visor after arriving in @entity16 's captital , @entity44 , they will complete a week of training before moving to @entity6 - built @entity7 treatment centres across the virus - ravaged nation			1
there , they will help diagnose and treat those who have fallen victim to @entity7 , which has killed more than 5,000 people - the majority in @entity16 , @entity54 and @entity55			1
in their fight against the deadly disease , the health workers have been kitted out with special protective suits , made by four @entity6 companies			1
the suits leave no part of a healthcare workers body exposed , providing a crucial barrier designed to keep them safe			2
the outfits include white overalls coated with a special plastic , which stops bodily fluids including blood , vomit and diarrhoea - which all carry the virus - from passing through the protective layer			1
the mouth and eyes - two areas most vulnerable to potential transmission - are covered by a mask and visor			1
each healthcare worker will wear two pairs of gloves , the outer pair acting as an extra seal			0
while the suit provides high levels of protection against @entity7 , the volunteers have been warned they must be careful when putting the suit on and taking it off			0
removing the protective gear in the right order is essential for reducing the risk of contracting the disease			0
once removed , the majority of the kit is burned , and replaced to further reduce the risk of transmission			0
the visor and boots are sprayed with chlorine to kill any trace of the virus			1
working in a difficult environment where temperatures soar to more than 30 Â° c , the @entity13 workers will only work for 45 - minute sessions , to prevent heat exhaustion			1
each medic 's name , role and the time they entered their ward will be written on their aprons to ensure they do n't exceed the set time limit			2

dr @entity148 claimed the suit he was given to treat @entity150 left his arms exposed as the sleeves were too short for him			0
doctors who initially treated her were not properly equipped either he said , wearing only impermeable gowns , double gloves , a hat and a face mask			0
more teams of volunteers are set to leave the @entity6 in the coming weeks after hundreds came forward to offer their services			2
they have been preparing for deployment with intensive training at a @entity167 facility in @entity168			0
most of the volunteers said they put themselves forward for humanitarian reasons			0
one of those leaving for @entity16 , dr @entity172 , 29 , from the intensive care unit at @entity174 : ' i guess there are many reasons i volunteered for this ; i am interested in infectious disease medicine , i have always wanted to do humanitarian work , i wanted to take on the challenge of working in this complex environment			1
prepared : @entity13 staff will undergo a week 's intensive training after arriving in @entity16 tomorrow			1
more teams of volunteers are set to leave in the coming weeks after hundreds came forward to offer their services ' but mainly i found myself less and less able to hear about the evolving situation in @entity9 and the increasing loss of life and do nothing			0
i felt i just had to go			0
' the first aim of this operation is simply to get well - trained staff there to open more treatment centre beds and see more patients , and do it safely			0
' i hope more @entity13 staff , particularly nurses and laboratory staff , will hear about this and be encouraged to volunteer			2
' dr @entity204 , 26 , a gp from the @entity206 , said : ' i am in a position to go and help			0
i was greatly assisted by the @entity208 , @entity209 in getting a medical education so it 's a privilege to give something back			0
' we have received superb training by the @entity6 military , who really should be recognised for their outstanding efforts in this crisis			2
' my gp practice has been hugely supportive of me going which has been fantastic			0
' dr @entity220 , 37 , an intensive care registrar from @entity222 in @entity223 , said : ' i decided to volunteer for the @entity7 response in @entity16 because this could be the biggest medical disaster of my lifetime , killing hundreds of thousands of people in the region			2
' to prevent this from happening and save vast numbers of lives , large - scale intervention has to happen now			0
' committed : within a week , @entity6 volunteers will be treating patients with the deadly ebola virus in west africa			1
they have been preparing with intensive training at a @entity167 facility in @entity168 chief medical officer dame @entity239 said : ' i have been really impressed with the numbers of @entity13 workers who have stepped forward to help the communities that have been devastated by @entity7			2
' the fact more than 1,000 have come forward so far is a real testament to their commitment to public service			0
' i want to offer my thanks to all those that are going , their efforts will make a real difference in @entity9			0
' previously the @entity254 has said @entity6 workers sent to fight the outbreak will not automatically be brought back to the @entity6 for treatment if they become infected			1
if they catch the virus , a decision to repatriate the patient will be made on a ' case by case ' basis , depending on whether it is in the patient 's medical interest to return .			2
