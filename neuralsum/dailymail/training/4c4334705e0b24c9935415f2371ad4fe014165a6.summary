a @entity1 man who was fined after his pet bear did its business outside a @entity1 newsagents has escaped having to pay after pointing out to police that the law only applies to dogs			1
@entity9 was walking his bear cub down @entity11 in the capital @entity13 when the animal was suddenly caught short			1

@entity22 cub : @entity9 with his pet bear cub which did its business on a @entity13 street infuriating the owner of a nearby newsagent @entity27 placed cheek : the cub was caught short during a walk around @entity13			1
it 's owner admitted that the result was ' more obvious than usual ' as it had been snowing ' then two policemen who were walking nearby came over and got involved , and told me i had to clean it up			0
when i pointed out i did n't have a bag , they tried to fine me			0
' but when the 27 - year - old pointed out that law only applied to dogs , police officers let him off with a warning			0
he agreed to come back later and clean up the mess with a shovel			0
he said : ' i have trained my bear to do all sorts of tricks as he is really smart , but i ca n't seem to train him not to do his business in inappropriate places			2
' let off : the bear 's owner @entity9 escaped a fine after pointing out to police that the law only applies to dogs he said : ' he is completely safe and well trained apart from one small issue of where exactly he is allowed to relieve himself			2
' i voluntarily keep him on a lead and make him wear a muzzle , but to be honest it is not really necessary but it makes people less nervous			0
' but although he is pretty tall when he stands up he is still really only a baby			0
' although not a common sight on the streets many @entity1 do keep bears as pets and it is perfectly legal to do so			1
