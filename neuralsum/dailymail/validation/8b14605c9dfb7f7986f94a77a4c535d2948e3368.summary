@entity0 will use international week to scout for @entity2 signings but he and his spies are more likely to be spotted at @entity4 - 21 or national youth team games than a @entity7 qualifier over the next 10 days			1
@entity0 wants his club to gain a standing in world football on a par with @entity12 for their development and production of young talent			1
that , he says , will enable @entity2 to tempt the elite young stars in @entity18 football to @entity19			2
the @entity2 manager ’s goal is to close out this season with a domestic @entity23 , then make the additions capable of helping the squad through the @entity27 qualifying rounds			2
however , it is unlikely that @entity0 will be throwing a few million pounds to secure any eye - catching signing that would raise supporter expectations ahead of that late summer campaign			1
@entity0 ( centre ) wants to implement the same youth production standards as @entity12 in the future he explained : ‘ we will bring in players but i think we will bring in younger players to build the next generation behind the current one			1
‘ if we are going to fight with the best clubs in @entity43 for the best 22 - year - olds , then you can forget it			0
the only chance we have to get a world - class player is to go to 16/17 - year - olds and say : “ you will train with the first team ”			0
‘ that ’s our chance to get a player in			0
we have to find some very big talents that can be the best ones			0
the @entity2 boss will use the international break as an opportunity to scout potential younger talent @entity2 have a great chance of completing a domestic treble and thrashed @entity60 once again ‘ we have to think younger and give them the chance to get in the squad and train with the best ones			1
‘ @entity12 get it because they have an unbelievable reputation — and we have to build , over the years , a reputation			0
that if you come to @entity2 , you see what is happening , you get sold to the big clubs and you get a good development			0
’ @entity0 helped @entity73 wonder kid @entity72 on to early stardom by handing him his first - team debut at 15 in @entity76			1
while @entity2 would not stand a chance of tempting him to @entity19 when @entity79 , @entity80 or @entity81 giants are scrapping for his signature , @entity0 believes less precocious talent than @entity72 can be mined then nurtured into better long - term prospects under him			1
‘ there are players there , maybe not at @entity72 level , but close , ’ said @entity0			0
‘ with a good development , they can be past @entity72 if he makes the wrong decisions and we make the right ones			0
’ @entity0 played a vital role in @entity72 's rise to stardom when he was @entity96 manager			2

@entity0 will be scouting *heavily* during the international break
the @entity2 boss wants to follow @entity12 's *blueprints* to produce talent
@entity2 eased past @entity60 again with a 3 - 0 *victory*
