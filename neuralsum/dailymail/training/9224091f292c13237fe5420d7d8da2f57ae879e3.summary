@entity0 will tomorrow face one of the biggest tests of his political career as he prepares for a tv showdown that he must win to have any hope of referendum victory			1
the first minister is under intense pressure going into the @entity10 debate , with a new poll revealing that only a quarter of no voters expect mr @entity14 to win the contest			1
failure to land a killer blow could end mr @entity0 's hopes of splitting the @entity19 , and he is receiving help from taxpayer - funded civil servants and a lifestyle guru in a last throw of the dice before the referendum			1
however , experts have warned such programmes rarely reshape the political landscape			0
as an uneasy truce for the @entity44 comes to an end , there will now be open warfare between both sides for the final few weeks of the referendum battle , with families set to be bombarded by mailshots costing taxpayers more than Â£ 850,000			2
@entity52 is running out for the @entity53 , with a new poll for @entity55 showing @entity58 campaign 's lead has increased slightly in recent days			2
the findings are a massive humiliation for deputy first minister @entity61 , who used a sunday newspaper interview yesterday to claim that @entity65 's stunning success in the @entity44 could give the @entity67 campaign the ' momentum ' to win the referendum			1
deputy prime minister @entity70 last night accused her of ' sullying ' the @entity44			1
a fan waved a @entity74 's flag during last night 's closing ceremony of the @entity44 at a @entity44 dominated by the ' photobomb ' , @entity0 should have been on high alert			1
an @entity78 fan mocked the first minister of scotland by waving the @entity80 behind his head as he watched @entity82 compete in the diving			2
it was a lighthearted reference to mr @entity0 's stunt last year , when he waved the @entity86 behind @entity88 's head at the @entity90 finals			1
the prank comes just six weeks before the @entity65 independence referendum			1
@entity0 waved the @entity86 behind @entity88 at @entity90 last year in fact , only 12 per cent of those surveyed said @entity95 2014 had made them more inclined to vote @entity67 , but four - fifths of that number said they were planning to vote for independence in the first place			1
the @entity102 study found more than 80 per cent said the @entity44 have made no difference to how they would vote and 7 per cent said it would make them more inclined to vote no. overall , the poll shows that 40 per cent of @entity65 plan to vote @entity67 - down one point since last month - with no change for the level of support for @entity110 at 46 per cent			0
the poll also found that only 11 per cent of voters expect mr @entity14 to win tomorrow 's tv debate , with 37 per cent backing mr @entity0			1
among @entity67 voters , 69 per cent said they backed the first minister , while just 24 per cent of no supporters said they believe mr @entity14 will emerge victorious			2
@entity117 , associate professor at @entity118 in @entity119 and author of @entity121 , said : ' while debates make great political theatre , they do n't necessarily have the power to reshape the political landscape			0
' whatever happens on tuesday , there is too much at stake for @entity65 voters to let two hours of televised combat determine their future			0
' professor @entity133 of @entity134 said : ' it 's clearly true the @entity67 side need it to make a difference			0
' all @entity14 , frankly , needs to do is try and hang on to what he 's got			0
i would say to him , play to type and make this as boring as possible			0
' it is understood mr @entity0 has preparing for the debate for around a week , enlisting the help of @entity145 , a psychologist more used to dealing with @entity147 football teams			1
asked if taxpayer - funded civil servants have been involved in the preparation , a spokesman for the @entity149 said : ' this is a standard media event			0
@entity0 was invited as first minister and has the normal office support			1
' better together campaign director @entity155 said : ' the pressure is on the first minister to finally give people honest answers to fundamental questions when he debates with @entity14			2
' the @entity44 had nothing to do with the referendum			0
' miss @entity61 said : ' i do think the momentum is with us			0
i think [ the @entity44 ] will inevitably leave a feelgood factor			0
' but speaking during a visit to @entity167 , mr @entity70 said : ' i think it was very gauche of @entity61 to try and extract political advantage from the @entity44			0
' the @entity44 is a wonderful festival and it really should n't be distorted or sullied by the politics of the @entity53			0
' mr @entity0 responded : ' @entity70 describing anybody else as gauche - that must be one of the quotes of the year			1
' i 'm not really annoyed by this			0
my self - denying ordinance and @entity61 's ends tomorrow and then there 's time enough to take on @entity70 or anyone else			2

first minister to go head - to - head with former chancellor tomorrow night
@entity0 wanted debate with @entity88 but @entity187 is leading no campaign
voters have their say in the independence referendum on *september* 18
