by @entity0 dr @entity1 caught by a @entity3 investigation claiming she can treat cancer with special remedy a spiritual healer who claims she can treat cancer with a special diet has been condemned by medical experts for giving ' dangerous advice '			1
@entity10 dr @entity1 , 62 , who has no medical qualifications , claims her ' @entity13 ' healing can prolong the lives of cancer victims by combating tumours			1
she was charging £ 280 a session			2
today she has fought back and said the journalist who came to her as a customer saying her had cancer deserves it for misrepresenting her			2
but professor @entity22 of charity @entity23 and @entity25 has hit out at dr @entity1 , saying that what she claims is ' scary '			1
dr @entity1 , whose real name is @entity29 , from @entity30 , maintains her treatments can help patients			1
following the investigation by the @entity3 's @entity35 programme dr @entity1 took the details of her treatments and price list off her website			1
the @entity3 undercover team took former cancer patient @entity41 , from @entity42 , to secretly film an appointment with dr @entity1			1
for the purposes of the filming , mr @entity41 , who was treated for non-hodgkin lymphoma when in his 20s , claimed to have had a relapse and be looking for treatment			2
according to dr @entity1 's website , ' @entity51 is a form of healing that centres around the understanding of own purpose in life			1
it incorporates the full array of all natural components working together in harmony and with the view of advancing the person to the next stage			2
' she believes it is impossible to repair an ailing body without searching for the roots of the disease in the soul			2
in a two - hour session , dr @entity1 gave mr @entity41 dietary advice and told him : ' if you want to stop cancer , you have to get high doses of quality calcium			1
' she also told him that only he could heal his disease and needed to live a ' pure ' life to do so			1
cancer sufferer @entity41 , ( pictured ) from @entity42 , secretly filmed an appointment with dr @entity1 for a @entity3 programme dr @entity1 sent out a detailed diet to mr @entity41 for a £ 90 fee			1
the diet recommended cabbage juice ' as it beats cancer ' and a particular herbal mixture which @entity87 says holds no benefits for cancer sufferers ' my @entity90 made @entity51 available to me in december 2002 , when he started speaking to me			2
@entity92 sees the energies in every molecule of my body and he specified several times a day what was needed for my repair ( of hip joints )			1
@entity92 equally saw every event that formed my soul and what i did to bring about my every experience			2
all made sense , and as i purified , my body repaired at an equal rate			2
since meeting in @entity105 560 bc , @entity92 and i shared 24 of the 28 pivotal incarnations that we each had			2
we were sisters , we were a couple , and we were un-related			2
we died as a @entity1 husband and wife in the 13th century in @entity111 , and we met as two men with different interests during @entity114 , in today 's @entity115			1
we were friends and we were enemies			0
the connection between our souls formed over the two and a half thousands of years of our spiritual growth is not subject to time , or place			1
' she claimed to have added ten years onto the life of a patient with terminal cancer			1
after the appointment , dr @entity1 also sent out a detailed diet for a £ 90 fee			1
the diet recommended cabbage juice ' as it beats cancer ' and a particular herbal mixture which @entity87 says holds no benefits for cancer sufferers			0
after the visit , mr @entity41 said : ' it makes me feel really angry when i heard what she was saying today			0
i just so hope that people are n't taken for it and that she stops what she is doing immediately			0
" prof @entity22 , who is research director for the @entity142 charity and a professor of experimental @entity143 at @entity146 's @entity145 , viewed the @entity3 's undercover footage			0
he said of dr @entity1 's advice : ' i think it 's dangerous			1
you 've got to remember the people she 's talking to are scared and frightened			0
' you know this kind of thing goes on but to actually see it happening is quite scary			0
' speaking to @entity156 , dr @entity1 said : ' i work in a non-conventional way and my website says this			1
' i work under the guidance of my spiritual guide , whereas these doctors work from books			1
it 's a matter of opinion			0
dr @entity1 's website no longer offers her services as a healer and now functions solelyy as a means of educating others about @entity51 ' i had been working on a detox diet for this guy and was going through hundreds of different ingredients and my spiritual guide told me cabbage juice would work for him			1
he then went away and wrote all these things about me which are just not relevant to what i do			0
' i can say if he does have cancer he deserves it			0
' it 's like going to the @entity181 and complaining that you ca n't buy normal groceries			0
' dr @entity1 claims to have cured three people with cancer and her website shows the profiles of two dogs which she claims she treated for cancer			1
since removing the pricing and details of her treatment she says she no longer practices and instead works as a linguist and uses her @entity13 website purely to educate others			0
in summer of 2003 , @entity197 looked suddenly gaunt			0
her strong muscles were disappearing from her body as i watched			0
the speed of her deterioration horrified me			0
we seemed to be running out of time			0
i asked @entity92 ( dr @entity1 's spiritual guide ) whether he would heal @entity197 of the cancer , and he said ' yes '			1
to succeed , even a carnivore had to be made vegan , as entirely toxins free fish would have been difficult and red meet practically impossible , to find in a supermarket or at a butcher			0
fighting a malignant outbreak in the body requires an immune system as efficient as can be , and lumbering it with toxic intake via meat as ' food ' , would have defeated the @entity217 cooked for @entity197 a diet of crushed aduki with a smaller amount of mung beans , with organic oats and rye ( after meat , wheat is also unsuitable for cancer ) , and i gave her multiple calcium , vitamin and mineral formulas in under normal circumstances unacceptable amounts - every three hours , day and night , for the first three weeks , which then extended to every six hours for another two months			0
i understood from @entity92 that although new cancer cells were still being made , after this phase , the body 's immune system became strong enough to reduce their numbers by about the same rate as they generated , which meant that the spread of the cancer was under control			0
treatment over the subsequent three months allowed us to suppress the disease			0
within about four months from starting the treatment , @entity197 's immune system became able to render harmless all existing , as well as the developing cancer cells in her body			0
maintaining moderate amounts of calcium and other remedies over the next three years helped @entity197 's body to gather the malignant cells into clearly defined pockets which were surgically removed in three stages by april 2006 .			0

dr @entity1 claims she is directed by her spiritual guide
she says he needed to live ' pure ' life in order to recover
