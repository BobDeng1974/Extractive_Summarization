@entity10 , 36 , has unlocked the secret of making posh nosh for pennies - by finding the right time to grab her ' luxury ' ingredients from the bargain bins at supermarkets @entity10 's cut - price cookery tips have become an internet favourite , with thousands following her frugal recipes she shops daily instead of weekly to grab the late bargains - and then freezes what she can for future gourmet treats			1
she and her partner eat like kings on a shoestring , enjoying dishes such as venison meatballs for 74p , pork fillet for 59p and sea bass for £ 1.99			1
do learn the times your local supermarket puts out its ' bargain ' foods : this will vary from shop to shop but tends to be nearer the end of the day when shelves are re-stocked ignore sell by dates : @entity10 eats things sometimes weeks past their official ' best before ' day , instead using common sense and the smell and look of the food to judge whether it is safe to eat ( this can be risky to do with meat )			1
be inventive : try creating new recipes which use up things about to go off in your fridge and cupboard freeze , pickle and preserve : if you ca n't eat the food that is on sale , buy it anyway and find a way to save it for another time do @entity70 plan too far ahead : being spontaneous with your meals allows you to eat whatever is the best buy that day throw away leftovers : @entity10 will use any left overs for another meal , often taking the remains of dinner into work as a packed lunch the couple feed themselves for just ' a few pounds ' a week , saving up to 90 per cent off their shopping			1

@entity10 said : ' it ’s all about eating as cheaply , as healthily and as tastily as possible			1
' i like eating very well but always think there are better things to spend my money on than the weekly shop			1
' so we changed the way we buy food			2
instead of going in once a week we pop in daily and pick up the stickered items nearing their sell - by date			1
' meat that has one day left on the shelves is perfectly good to fill up my freezer and cook another day			2
' i like to prove wrong all those who think eating well equals empty pockets			2
' instead i encourage people to get creative in the kitchen to see just how much money they can save while also feasting heartily			2
' times are hard for a lot of people but you do n’t have to fork out to eat well			2
' they then cook luxury dishes such as roast goose with kiwi , mint and lime sorbet , limoncello syllabub with blackberry coulis and stewed peaches with custard and amaretti biscuits			1

more often than not products are okay to eat days after the use by date			2
