@entity0 has admitted he felt ‘ worthless ’ during his two - year spell as a @entity3 player after his dream move to @entity5 turned sour			1
the 22 - year - old winger was signed by then @entity5 boss sir @entity7 in january 2013 from @entity8 for £ 10million			1
but the terms of the transfer saw him loaned straight back to the @entity8 for the remainder of the season and he did not arrive at @entity5 until the summer , by which time @entity7 had retired and been replaced by @entity14			1
@entity0 has rediscovered his form at @entity8 this season during a disastrous campaign for the club under @entity14 , @entity16 made just four @entity3 appearances before playing out the second half of last season at @entity22			1
‘ there is nothing worse than not being involved , ’ he told the @entity23			2
‘ you are sitting there thinking ‘ what exactly am i ? a footballer who is not playing football ? ’ you feel a bit worthless sitting in the stands , watching all the time			2
you have nothing to speak about with the players			2
@entity16 made just four appearances for @entity3 in two years with the club ‘ if you have played the game then it ’s “ well done ” or “ you should have passed here or there ”			1
but when you have n’t played … i think people lose a bit of respect for you			0
i think they are thinking ‘ well , he ’s not played ’			0
they do n’t have anything to speak to you about			0
it ’s a big thing			0
’ ‘ there were so many rumours about me that were not true			0
and they hurt me because all i was doing was keeping my head down to do my best every time and then after training i ’d go home and there would be something in the paper or wherever about me not having a good attitude and that ’s why i was n’t playing , rumours about my private life and that ’s why i was n’t playing , me turning up late for this , turning up late for that			0
’ @entity16 revealed the last straw came when he was left on the bench against @entity68 outfit @entity67 as @entity3 crashed out of the @entity69 4 - 0 last august			2
eventually he spoke to new @entity3 boss @entity71 , who confirmed that he was n't part of his first - team plans and so he headed back on a season - long loan deal to @entity8 , where he flourished under @entity76 , and the deal was made permanent in february this year			1
@entity71 told @entity16 he was n't part of his plans after @entity69 snub			0

@entity0 *joined* @entity3 for £ 10m in january 2013
@entity83 made debut in july but only made three more appearances
