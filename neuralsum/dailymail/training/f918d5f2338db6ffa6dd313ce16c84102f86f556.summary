more than £ 1.8m is to be paid back to motorists after they were fined for driving over a city centre bridge			1
almost 60,000 motorists were issued with penalty notices for using the @entity4 in @entity5 after controversial traffic restrictions were introduced			1
but the scheme was abandoned after an independent review found the council may have acted unlawfully , and @entity10 has confirmed a process for the public to claim the money back is now being worked on			1
council leaders in @entity5 restricted access to the busy bridge in during an ill - fated traffic experiment council officials wrongly designated the bridge a bus lane when the trial was launched in august 2013 before the scheme was launched , the bridge , pictured , was heavily congested throughout the day cllr @entity23 , cabinet member for transport , said the trial ' was never about making money ' and that work had to be done to resolve traffic issues in @entity5			1
he said : ' but whilst the trial achieved some of its aims , it had become too polarizing an issue , requiring too much resource , and so detracting from other necessary transport policies			2
' an application will have to be made for refunds to be given as " a statement of goodwill " and will not be volunteered as that would legally say the scheme was wrong			2
' but following the decision , the leader of @entity10 , councillor @entity43 , has faced calls from the @entity46 to stand down			1
cllr @entity47 , leader of @entity5 's @entity46 , said : ' the closure of @entity4 was botched from start to finish and has done deep reputational damage to @entity5			1
' as well as repaying the fines , @entity52 should apologise to the residents , visitors and businesses caught out by the unlawful closure			0
' he continued : ' they need to explain how the repayment process will work and what effect this decision will have on council budgets			2
they also need to accept our calls for a full scrutiny review of the trial so that all lessons are learnt			2
' what is clear though is that ultimate responsibility for the shambles sits with the council leader @entity43 and i , along with many taxpayers , will now expect him to recognise this and resign			2
' council officials expect they will have to repay £ 1.8 million in fines levied during the botched experiment meanwhile , conservative @entity47 @entity79 , said : ' now finally , not before time , they are forced to repay the fines yet still manage to dig the knife in as the ultimate penalty is paid by the @entity5 taxpayer who has to pick up the bill			1
' not only for the hundreds of thousands to repay fines but also the massive cost it will take to administer , the effect on services this may have as well as the city 's reputation which they leave in tatters			2
' @entity95 even has the gall to say , " all parties told me they want to move on "			0
indeed but he can not be so naive to believe others will share his administrations blame			0
in any other industry , heads would roll			0
' he suggested senior figures at the council should resign			0
conservative leader @entity105 said ' heads should roll ' over the matter and said officers should be answerable			0
he said the matter was of great reputational and financial cost to @entity111 the basis of independent legal advice , the @entity10 had been contesting the @entity115 's challenge to both the @entity4 and @entity117 schemes			1
it will now only continue to contest the @entity119 @entity43 said : ' when @entity46 back the cause of conservatives , that speaks volumes			0
' councillors from all parties have told me that they want to move on , and they are right			0
it is for this reason , to draw the matter to a close and as a gesture of goodwill , that we make this announcement today			0
' the council does not accept the finding of the @entity136 as regards the lawful ability to regulate traffic in this way , and is therefore continuing to pursue a review of the @entity136 's decision in relation to the permanent @entity117 order			0
' however , the @entity4 trial has now finished , and for this reason , the council does not consider it to be in the public interest to pursue the review in respect of @entity4			1
' the council has taken the decision that in respect of those people who received a fine during the trial traffic regulation of @entity4 , a refund will be made if they make a particular request to the council			1
this is due to the clear level of public concern during the trial			0
' it is hoped that this can be seen as a statement of goodwill and we are drawing a line under the matter			0
' the bridge was used by many tourists who were unaware of the restrictions and hit with a £ 30 fine			1

@entity5 restricted *car* access to the @entity4 as a trial in august 2013
almost 60,000 motorists were fined for *crossing* the bridge during the trial
now , council officials have *agreed* to repay more than £ 1.8 million
