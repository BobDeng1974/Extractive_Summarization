' mr @entity2 denied he had overreacted by cancelling his tour and insisted that he had been the subject of co-ordinated attacks			1
he said : ' it 's clear in the past fortnight - you can see on all the social media sites - that that was co-ordinated by the @entity118 offices at a local level			2

' the eyes of the world are on @entity6 for the next two and a half weeks			0
