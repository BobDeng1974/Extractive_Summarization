by @entity0 flowers in bloom are one of the great joys of spring , but when viewed under a colour scanning electron microscope , they reveal an even greater surreal , alien - like beauty			1
from rose petals to arnica stigmas , and hibiscus stamens to pollen grains , a @entity10 photographer has captured the images with the help of a biologist from the @entity10 microscopy team at @entity17			1
the process of preparing the flowers to be photographed takes days of meticulous drying and coating in order to capture the beauty without the samples disintegrating			1
the images , including this shot of a rose petal , were taken by photographer @entity27 and biologist @entity28			1
the pair took the shots using a colour scanning electron microscope			1
roses are ancient symbols of love			0
it is national flower of @entity37 , as well as the provincial flower of @entity39 , @entity40			0
in the 15th century , @entity41 introduced the @entity42 rose - a red rose for the @entity44 and a white rose for the @entity46 - after civil wars that became known as the @entity48 ‘ flowers are beautiful in " normal ' " view , but when you look closer , some parts get very bizarre and unexpected structures appear - flowers within flowers , worlds within worlds , ’ @entity27 said			1
for a decade the pair , based in @entity58 in the south of @entity10 , worked with an @entity5 they saved from the scrapheap , but for the last five years they have used a £ 250,000 @entity62			1
the breathtaking shots show that these floral displays did not evolve to please our human senses , but instead serve the single purpose of attracting insects that will help pollinate the plant and allow it to reproduce			1
to prepare the specimens , @entity27 and @entity71 took small pieces of each flower petal or leaf and put them through a dehydration process , before immersing them in 100 per cent alcohol			1

this image shows the surface of a rapeseed flower petal that resembles the scaly skin of a lizard or snake			2
@entity89 is a member of the same family as the mustard and cabbage family , @entity92			0
its oil was produced in the 19th century as lubricant for steam engines and , more recently , is used as diesel biofuel the stigma of an arnica flower is pictured left , which reveals the top part of the female reproductive structure , known as the carpel			0
it resembles a spiky tongue			0
the anther of a flower of the small - leaved lime is pictured right			1
the anther is the part of the flower that collects the pollen from the stamen that produces it four lilac flower pollen grains pictured on a petal of the purple plant			2
the grains resemble a human brain and vary significantly to the bright red grains photgraphed on the coltsfoot , and the spiky grey grains of the arnica plant also captured by the @entity124 microscopy team later , the alcohol was replaced with carbon dioxide in a pressure chamber to carry out what the team called the ‘ critical - point ’ step of the drying process			1
this meticulous method has been designed to maintain the appearance of the the sensitive and delicately thin surface of each plant - without which , the cells would collapse and the flowers would disintegrate			1
after being mounted on an aluminium platelet , each specimen was then coated in gold before being photographed			1
in one image , a close up shot of a rose petal resembles rows of raspberries , while the surface of a rapeseed flower looks like the scaly skin of a lizard or snake			2
this image shows pollen grains , shown in grey , on the yellow stigma of the arnica flower			0
@entity157 is also known by the names @entity159			0
the flowers contain a toxin called helenalin , which can be poisonous if ingested in large amounts and has been known to cause gastroenteritis			0
touching the plant can also cause skin irritation			2
its name is believed to come from the @entity169 arna , which means lamb because of the plants soft , hairy leaves this shot taken of a rapeseed leaf , with the light hitting the specimen from behind , makes it appear like a section of coral deep under the sea			2
after being submerged in alcohol , the liquid was replaced with carbon dioxide in a pressure chamber to carry out the final step of the drying process			1

the left - hand image shows the bright red pollen of the coltsfoot flower , and resembles cod roe			2
the hibiscus flower is renowned for its bright red and pink petal , but its stamens , pictured right , look almost dull in comparison			0
tiny , spiky pollen grains are attached to the curved tips			0
the surface resembles the skin of an elephant another shot taken of a rapeseed leaf , with the light hitting the specimen from behind , makes it appear like a section of coral deep under the sea			2
in two of the images , @entity27 and @entity71 capture pollen grains sat on the petals of arnica and lilac flowers			1
the arnica image resembles bacteria and its grey pollen grains look menacing with their sharp edges			0
by contrast , the pollen of the lilac is yellow and round and resembles the human brain			0
the stigma of the same arnica specimen in a separate image looks like a spiky tongue			2
small yellow grains of pollen are scattered on the petal hairs of a marigold			0
the golden colour of the marigold gives the rubber gloves of the same colour its name			0
potted marigold florets are edible and used to add colour to salads , or as a garnish			0
the flowers were used in ancient @entity169 , @entity251 , @entity252 and @entity254 cultures as a medicinal herb as well as a dye for fabrics , foods and cosmetics the image on the left shows the floret of a chamomile flower , while the right - hand image is of a valerian flower which resembles the face of a bug			0
the @entity269 root is often used to treat anxiety and sleeping disorders			0
it was used in ancient @entity169 and @entity273 , and @entity274 is thought to have been the first to link it to relieving insomnia			0
it is native to @entity278 and parts of @entity280 by stark contrast , the pollen of the coltsfoot flower is shown as bright red , and resembles cod roe			0
the pair have previously used their @entity5 to take artistic images of bacteria , parasites , and butterflies to herbs , water bears , plant poisons and silverfish			1
‘ working in the microscopic dimensions has completely changed our view of the world , ’ @entity27 said .			2

images were taken by eye of *science* microscopy photographer @entity27 and biologist @entity28
the pair took the shots using a high - *resolution* colour scanning electron microscope ( @entity5 )
they began by dehydrating small pieces of the plants before immersing them in 100 *%* alcohol
later , the alcohol was replaced with carbon dioxide in a pressure chamber to complete the drying process
*technique* keeps the appearance of the sensitive surface of the plant intact , without which the cells would collapse
after being mounted on an aluminium platelet , each specimen was coated in gold and photographed
