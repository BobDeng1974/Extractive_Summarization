across the world , people are crammed around their television sets , eagerly watching the $ 42million spectacular of @entity4 ’s @entity3			1
but those watching stateside will be forced to wait until 7:30pm est , when @entity6 will broadcast the show , three and a half hours from the actual start of the ceremony , adjusted for time differences			1
the network , which has sole rights to broadcasting the @entity13 in @entity14 , has chosen to delay their broadcast to the chagrin of viewers hoping to catch a live glance of the elaborate ceremonies			1
click here to watch highlights from the opening ceremony delayed : the live broadcast of the @entity3 in @entity4 are being held by @entity6 , and will be broadcast instead at 7:30pm est tonight ; here , the performance has already started satire : journalism professor and tv commenter @entity27 tweeted this topical thought further , they chose not to stream the events online , the @entity30 said			1
an @entity14 in @entity4 : @entity33 presidential candidate @entity32 , right , is at tonight 's ceremony this means that those wanting to watch on the @entity37 must wait a full six and a half hours before seeing the commencement of the @entity39			1
journalist and former tv critic @entity27 was among many who voiced their anger over the delay in the games			2
mr @entity27 tweeted : ' without @entity6 live streaming of the @entity13 opening ceremonies , i 'll have to rely on @entity32 's tweets			1
' mr @entity32 has been doing damage control after questioning if @entity50 was capable of handling the @entity13			1
the presidential candidate has been on a high - profile tour of the country , and is attending the night 's ceremonies			2
@entity6 , which has owned the @entity14 broadcasting rights to the @entity13 since 1988 , most likely held the broadcast so it would hit square in prime time			1
advertisers pay more for time slots in such programming			2
according to @entity62 , @entity6 purchased the rights to the @entity13 from 2014 - 2020 for a staggering $ 4.38billion			1
they were awarded the right by the @entity66			2
the site said that @entity6 lost $ 223million in its broadcast of the 2010 @entity69 , and is slated to lose even more in the @entity4 broadcast			1
isolation : this @entity73 user ( hyperbolicly ) said he would turn off every form of social media ahead of tonight 's delayed events @entity78 , the editor - in - chief of @entity80 paper @entity77 called @entity6 ’s actions a ‘ clueless , arrogant disgrace			1
’ the jilted editor wrote in an editorial that he and his staffers had planned an office party , complete with drinks and pizza			0
when he realised that the pizza orders had to be cancelled , he wrote : ‘ @entity14 's reputation at the @entity91 has already taken a hit thanks to the brainless gibbering of @entity32 in the last few days			1
’ he continued : ‘ and the notion that the @entity6 's audience figures are more important than the @entity91 just supports stereotypes that @entity14 are insular , arrogant and could not care less of about anything that happens beyond the country 's borders			1
i know they are not			0
’ today show host @entity102 , along with the rest of the popular morning show , have been broadcasting live from the @entity105 capital and will continue their broadcast from @entity4 ’s @entity108 for the duration of the two - week games			2
@entity6 affiliates like @entity112 , @entity113 , and @entity114 will all broadcast events			1
@entity6 earlier told the @entity116 ’ @entity117 that it has collected $ 1billion in @entity13 advertising , including digital and cross-platform adverts			1
included in that are apps for mobile and tablet devices , and a @entity124 channel			0
a full list of tomorrow 's events may be seen here			2
how do you feel about the delay ? let us know in the comments section			0
@entity50 opened its @entity13 with a royal entrance like no other			1
@entity4 greeted the world in a celebration of @entity135 that was stunning , imaginative , whimsical and dramatic - and cheeky - even featuring a stand - in for @entity137 parachuting into @entity138			0
moments later , the 86 - year - old monarch herself stood solemnly while a children 's choir serenaded her with ' @entity142 , ' and members of the @entity144 , @entity145 and @entity146 raised the @entity147			2
fighter jets streaming red , white and blue smoke roared over the stadium , packed with a buzzing crowd of 60,000 people , at 8:12 p.m. - or 20:12 in the 24 - hour time observed by @entity50			0
ringing in : the @entity91 rings are illuminated with pyrotechnics as they are raised above the stadium foggy day : a storm cloud is suspended over the stadium , giving a cheeky nod to the country 's notoriously grey summer an explosion of fireworks against the @entity4 skyline and @entity164 leading a singalong were to wrap up the three - hour show masterminded by one of @entity50 's most successful filmmakers , @entity170 winner @entity169			1
he led off his spectacular in his favoured medium , with a high - speed flyover of the @entity174 , the river that slices like a vein through @entity4 and was the gateway for the city 's rise over the centuries as a great global hub of trade and industry			2
the rush of images showed a cricket match , the @entity186 and the roaring , abundant seas that buffet and protect this island nation - set to a pulsating soundtrack including snippets of the @entity194 ' more irreverent cover of ' @entity142			0
' to open the ceremony , children popped balloons with each number from 10 to 1 , leading a countdown that climaxed with @entity200 , the newly crowned @entity202 champion			0
wearing his race - winner 's yellow jersey , @entity203 rang a 23 - ton @entity207 from the same @entity4 foundry that made @entity209 and @entity211 's @entity210			2
idyllic : artists perform a scene in pastoral wear good health : actors perform in a sequence meant to represent @entity50 's @entity219 ( @entity219 ) perform its thunderous chime echoed around the 80,000 - seat @entity138			2
bells in @entity50 have traditionally pealed to celebrate the end of war and the crowning of kings and queens , and now for the opening of a 17 - day festival of sports			0
the show then shifted to a portrayal of @entity50 that @entity50 cling to - a place of meadows , farms , sport on village greens , picnics and @entity239 , @entity241 's fictional bear who has delighted generations of @entity50 children tucked warmly in bed			2
but the @entity50 ideal - to quote poet @entity247 , of ' @entity135 's green and pleasant land ' - then took a darker , grittier turn			2
the set was literally torn asunder , the hedgerows and farm fences carried away , as @entity169 shifted to the industrial transformation that revolutionized @entity50 in the 18th and 19th centuries , the foundation for an empire that reshaped world history			0
belching chimneys rose where only moments earlier sheep had trod			0
@entity262 : artists arrive on a horse and carriage , a nod to a bygone era of top hats and waistcoats variations on @entity50 themes : @entity169 drew inspiration for the show from @entity50 culture , including @entity275 , @entity276 and @entity277 , as well as @entity278 country affair : performers carry instruments during a segment of the ceremony the @entity284 also produced terrifying weapons , and @entity169 built a moment of hush into his show to honour those killed in war			0
' this is not specific to a country ; this is across all countries , and the fallen from all countries are celebrated and remembered , ' he explained to reporters ahead of the ceremony			0
' because , obviously , one of the penalties of this incredible force of change that happened in a hundred years was the industrialization of war , and the fallen , ' he said			0
' you know , millions fell			0
' @entity91 organizers separately rejected calls for a moment of silence for 11 @entity310 athletes and coaches slain by @entity313 gunmen at the @entity314			1
regal : looking festive in a pale coral , @entity137 , right , and @entity316 , president of the @entity66 , right , appear at the festivities two of the @entity310 ' widows appealed to audience members to stand in silence when @entity66 chief @entity316 rises to speak later at friday 's ceremony			2
the @entity310 culture and sport minister planned to do just that			0
since then , 8,000 torchbearers , mostly unheralded @entity50 , have carried the flame on a 70 - day , 8,000 - mile journey from toe to tip of the @entity330 , whipping up enthusiasm for a $ 14 billion @entity13 taking place during a severe recession			1
the identity of the last torchbearer , the one to light the cauldron , was kept secret - remarkable given the intense scrutiny at what have been called the first social media @entity13			1
speculation focused on @entity341 , the first man to run a four - minute mile , in 1954 , and on rower @entity342 , among others			0
royal spectators : the @entity346 and @entity347 enjoy the atmosphere ahead of the ceremony majestic : the @entity351 fly over the @entity138 at sunset , leaving plumes of red , white , and blue in the sky @entity169 's $ 42 million show , with 15,000 volunteers , promised to take the expected global television audience of 1 billion on a rich and textured journey through @entity50 history			1
in the center of the stadium , where athletes like @entity364 will star in the coming weeks , @entity169 constructed a giant set portraying a romanticized vision of a green and pleasant @entity50			0
@entity367 wisped from the crooked chimneys of a homely thatched cottage			0
meadows of perky pink flowers , spreads of real grass , fake fluffy clouds and live animals - including 40 cream - colored sheep - transported spectators from the @entity378 of @entity4 to a rural idyll so dear to @entity105 hearts			0
that was later to give way to darker , grittier segments dwelling on the industrial might upon which @entity50 built a global empire and shaped world history			0
not so happy : spectators pass along a huge inflatable ball during the @entity3 ; many in the @entity14 are upset they wo n't see the ceremony ' live ' full house : thousands of spectators - an estimated 60,000 - take their seats ahead of the ceremony @entity169 's challenge was daunting : to be as memorable as @entity397 's incredible , money - no - object opening ceremony of 2008			1
he drew from @entity278 , @entity50 pop culture , literature and music , and other sources of inspiration that will speak to - but perhaps at times baffle - not just @entity406 but people across the globe			0
one segment featured the actor @entity410 as @entity276 , and former @entity411 @entity164 was to lead a sing - along			0
for @entity316 , it was his last time as president of the @entity66 to watch the @entity91 flag being raised at an opening ceremony			1
he will step down in 2013 after completing the maximum two terms			0
besides the thousands of athletes and performers , 60,000 spectators were expected to pack @entity138			0
political leaders from around the world , @entity14 first lady @entity421 and her daughters , and a sprinkling of @entity425 and celebrity royalty were also attending .			1

@entity6 network delaying broadcast of tonight 's @entity3 until 7:30pm est , three and a half hours after they began
outraged @entity91 enthusiasts took to @entity73 to voice complaint
