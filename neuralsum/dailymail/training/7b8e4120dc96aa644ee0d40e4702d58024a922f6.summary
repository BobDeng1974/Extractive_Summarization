mr and mrs @entity36 said they feared at one point their daughter would die			1
mrs @entity36 , a housewife , added : ' she overheated and started convulsing as if she was having febrile convulsions			0
' she was boiling hot			0

' it was heartbreaking to see my daughter so ill and to find out she had contracted salmonella is terrifying			1
' mr @entity1 said : ' the food was sometimes undercooked , we saw some food uncovered so flies were buzzing around , and we suspected they were re-using food between meals - which became pretty obvious when they served up peas and sprouts for breakfast one morning			1
