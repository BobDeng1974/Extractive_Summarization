soldiers have been reminded who they are supposed to salute after senior officers complained they were not being enough shown respect by the lower ranks			1
the @entity5 issued guidance on the hierarchy of military ranking after @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 chiefs said younger officers were not saluting the right people			1
while a missed salute may seem like a petty complaint , there have been instances of top brass being called ' boss ' or ' mate ' by servicemen			1
an @entity12 source told the @entity39 : ' there 's been some concern that this has been going on			0
this has been pushed forward hard by top brass and it appeared in the journal after a prod from someone high up			1
' it 's been done in a light - hearted manner , but behind it , it 's pretty serious			0
' the guide , published in an in - house @entity5 journal , says : ' as anyone who works in defence knows , there are clearly defined rank structures			1
but , while the pecking order may be clear within your own service , equivalent ranks or grades in the other services may be less apparent			2
' with joint operations becoming increasingly common and many bases run by a mix of uniformed and civilian @entity5 staff , you need to know where you stand			2
the @entity5 issued guidance in the hierarchy of military ranking after @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 chiefs said younger officers were not saluting the right people ' if nothing else , we hope this helps you know whom you should salute and to find your way to the correct mess			1
' another military source said : ' you would be amazed by some of the greetings [ from young officers to those above them in the hierarchy ]			0
' while another added : ' over the last decade , some have been very informal with each other			0
they often refer to a senior officer as boss , rather than sir			2
some accept it , but others want to be called sir			0
it 's been a minor problem for some time , but they are trying to keep it very much in check			0
