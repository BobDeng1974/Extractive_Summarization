by @entity0 published : 17:26 est , 15 may 2013 updated : 22:23 est , 15 may 2013 when a beautiful young woman loses her breasts , the last thing you expect her to say is that she 's delighted			1
but , believe me , i understand exactly why @entity7 is overjoyed to have lost hers			1
i also completely understand why @entity8 claims it 's a happy day for their family			2
because i felt exactly the same when i became the first woman in @entity13 to have an elective mastectomy 20 years ago			1
brave choices : @entity0 ( left ) with daughter @entity16			1
both have had double mastectomies to reduce the risk of breast cancer the truth is that no woman would choose to lose both her breasts - particularly a woman as flawlessly beautiful as @entity7 - without having the most compelling reason			1
but then , if you 're like @entity7 and know that you stand an 87 per cent chance of developing cancer in those very same breasts , your priorities change in a heartbeat			1
and i understand the trauma that lies behind her decision			2
like @entity7 , i saw my mother die of cancer			1
like @entity7 , i vowed i would do anything to stop my little girl losing her mother			1
and , like @entity7 , i was just 37 when i elected to have a double mastectomy in april 1993			1
the terrifying truth is that one woman in 200 carries a faulty gene which puts her at a high risk of developing breast cancer			1
however proud you are of your body , if you are faced with losing your life , your breasts suddenly stop seeming that important			2
and - as @entity7 proves - a mastectomy does n't stop you feeling feminine , looking beautiful or being loved by one of the sexiest men on the planet			1
@entity7 bares all : the actress has revealed she has had an elective mastectomy so while i suspect @entity7 will be taking time to come to terms with her new body , i believe she will never regret her decision			1
she may occasionally mourn the breasts she has lost			1
but her overwhelming feeling will be relief , because knowing you are carry a ticking timebomb in your body is almost unimaginably frightening			2
it 's especially chilling when you know that you have every chance of passing it on to your own children			2
in my case , i have n't just experienced the surgery myself , i 've watched my own daughter , @entity16 , endure the same operation			1
@entity16 was 23 when she was told she , too , carried the @entity75 gene			1
knowing the sense of relief it brought me , i encouraged her to have a double mastectomy			1
now @entity16 , 31 , is expecting a baby with her partner , @entity81			1
their child - they do n't know the sex - is due in july			2
the whole family will be thrilled if she is a girl			2
but there will also be the unspoken knowledge that one day , unless there are massive strides in cancer prevention , she will probably face losing her breasts			1
but the fact that an a-list celebrity like @entity7 is making that tough journey helps make it more acceptable			2
when i had my preventative mastectomy in the early @entity99 , it seemed so extreme that even my closest friends thought i was totally mad			2
if i 'd said i was planning to grow two heads , they would n't have been more stunned			2
and that made it all the harder			2
but my decision was born of the knowledge there was a scenario far worse than losing my breasts			2
i was nine when i watched my mother nurse my grandmother as she lay dying from breast cancer			1
i was 16 when i watched my mother , a teacher , die herself from the same disease			2
i had a bust that most women would be proud of ( i was a @entity116 cup ) but instead of pride , i felt loathing and fear			2
i was so paranoid i might find a lump that i even refused to check them			2
my fear deepened when @entity16 was born in october 1981			1
would she be left motherless ? i was convinced there had to be a genetic reason why so many women in my family were blighted by breast cancer but doctors dismissed the idea			1
' the fact that an a-list celebrity like @entity7 is making that tough journey helps make it more acceptable , ' says @entity0 everything changed in 1990			1
i had a chance meeting with a cousin , @entity136			0
my blood ran cold as she explained she had suffered two bouts of breast cancer in her early 30s			1
her sister , @entity141 , had died at the age of 38 and their mother , @entity143 , had just developed breast cancer at 67			1
sick with dread , i plotted a family tree			0
it showed that , over three generations , nine of the ten females contracted breast cancer			1
often the gene had been passed through a male relative			0
when i showed my gp my bit of paper , he seemed as stunned as me and agreed to check my breasts every three months			0
even so , i could n't shake off the fear			0
i remember telling my sister , @entity161 , who later discovered she , thankfully , does n't have the defective gene : ' i want to get rid of them right now			0
' i was only 37 , but i felt i had a death sentence hanging over me			0
and then , to my great excitement , the @entity166 opened at the @entity169 's @entity168 - not far from my home in @entity171 , @entity172 - looking at genetic links in cancer			2
because of my family history , i was referred to @entity176 , professor of preventative oncology			0
when i suggested having my breasts removed , he did n't dismiss the idea out of hand			0
in fact - extreme as it seemed - he was incredibly supportive			0
@entity181 was my new husband , @entity181 , a policeman			0
we had married in 1990 after my first marriage , to @entity16 's dad , ended in 1986			1
and i knew that our love went so much deeper than whether i had breasts or not			0
it may sound strange , but the thought of losing them did n't worry me			0
i knew i would n't feel less feminine			0
rather , just like @entity7 i felt i was empowering myself , and that felt incredibly exciting			0
their biggest concern seemed to be how @entity181 would cope , that he would drop me because i was no longer ' all woman '			0
they asked : ' why not wait until you 've got cancer ? ' how can you explain to someone who 's never been there what it feels like to be stalked by fear every day of your life ? i had the operation in @entity169			2
i can vividly remember coming round after the surgery , looking down at my flat chest under the bedclothes and crying , not because i was sad but because i was so relieved			0
the other women in the ward were recovering from surgery to stop their cancer spreading			2
many had months of painful treatment ahead of them			0
all i had were a few scars and the knowledge that the danger had passed			0
i 'd dodged the bullet			0
i was offered reconstructive surgery six months later , but i turned it down			0
although i am totally flat - chested , i do n't mind a bit			0
at 58 , it 's who i am and i ca n't imagine life now with a full bust			0
i rarely even wear any prosthetics to give myself shape , and yet no one seems to notice			0
the @entity226 - winning actress announced that she had a mastectomy in an op - ed she authored for tuesday 's @entity229 under the headline , " @entity231			1
" i was so relaxed after the operation that i did n't try to hide my naked chest from @entity16			1
and i know that my ' new look ' never worried @entity181 at all			0
things have changed since , however			0
@entity16 had a reconstruction at the same time as her operation			1
indeed , @entity7 says she is delighted with her own reconstruction which she had two months after her mastectomy			2
her scars are so small , she says , she is happy for her children to see them			0
a year after my operation , the gene test for @entity75 was pioneered			0
the blood test confirmed what i already suspected - i had the faulty gene			0
i had made the right decision			0
@entity249 pictured with her mum , @entity0			1
@entity16 , 24 , became the youngest woman in @entity13 to have an elective double mastectomy			1
i desperately hoped that @entity16 was n't a carrier too			1
but it was a great comfort to know that , if the blood test proved positive , she , too , could elect to have a mastectomy			2
we agreed that it was best for her to wait until she was old enough to deal with the consequences of any bad news			0
in january 2004 , when she was 22 , she took the test			0
i held her hand as we sat in the consultant 's room when she learned that , like me , she had an 87 per cent chance of developing breast cancer			1
of course , we were upset			0
but @entity16 knew what she was going to do			1
she booked a double mastectomy for january 2006 - giving her plenty of time for counselling and to adjust to what lay ahead			1
i felt desperate i had passed this faulty gene on to her			0
but i was immensely proud of the way she coped : she refused to feel sorry for herself			0
although they were so young , her friends were wonderfully supportive and three days before the operation threw a ' saying goodbye to @entity16 's @entity277 '			1
when i saw @entity16 after her surgery and reconstruction , i burst into tears			1
the surgeon had built @entity16 new breasts , and they looked so lovely			1
our shared experience has brought us even closer			0
as @entity7 shows - losing your breasts is n't an end			0
for those of us who carry @entity75 , it 's the start of a wonderful new phase in our lives			0
