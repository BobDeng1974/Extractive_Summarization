by @entity0 having taken dog ’s abuse from @entity8 fans for daring to leave the @entity9 , @entity4 ’s @entity3 title winner @entity1 is in no mood to deliberately open up old wounds ahead of the @entity13 clash against his former club at @entity15 on sunday			1
but ask the 27 - year - old son of @entity17 a direct question and you ’ll usually get a direct answer , which is why he does n’t consider @entity22 ’s new - look team , boosted by the arrival of @entity24 , genuine challengers for @entity4 ’s championship crown just yet			1
‘ i think @entity27 will be the biggest threat			1
for me , @entity8 still have a weakness in defensive mid and at centre - back , ’ he says without any thought of shirking the issue			1
@entity40 is a great replacement for @entity42 , i know that from playing with him at @entity8			1
they had a weakness up front so they 've signed @entity47 who was great for @entity49 last season			2
they lost @entity51 but bought in @entity52			0
‘ they have also done their business fast so the players have had time to spend working together			2
they will be really dangerous			0
’ as for the rest , @entity1 is slightly skeptical , particularly as he thinks @entity59 @entity58 star @entity24 will need time to bed in after his £ 35million move from @entity63			1
‘ @entity34 have bought a lot of players but they have also lost ( @entity52 ) @entity66 and it ’s really hard to replace a guy like this			0
‘ for @entity8 , @entity24 has the quality , but the @entity3 is not @entity71			1
it is really , really hard			0
‘ we saw that with @entity74 last year			0
we expected a lot from him and at the start of the season he was brilliant			2
but he found out when every other league has a break in december , you carry on playing in @entity82			0
' stupid ' : @entity1 is given stick by @entity8 fans as he sits on the bench at the @entity9 in 2012 content : @entity1 is now enjoying his football at the @entity88 , with two @entity3 titles in three years ' it is tough and i think players need a year to adapt			1
we had the same with @entity94 at @entity4			1
he had a lot of injuries in his first year , now he ’s come back second time around and is flying in pre-season			2
‘ the only player i know who came in from abroad and made an impact during his first season was @entity101 at @entity102			2
the rest at some point have all had their ups and downs			0
’ dissing @entity8 ’s title chances and politely suggesting we might have to wait 12 months to see the best of @entity24 is n’t going to go down well with @entity112 fans who accused @entity1 of joining @entity4 for the money in 2011			1
a video of him being abused by @entity8 supporters was posted online last year when he went to the @entity9 as a spectator to see them play @entity4			1
@entity1 does n’t seem to think the situation will ever alter but describes the animosity as “ stupid ” and believes fans are misguided to think professional players should feel the same blind loyalty to clubs as they do			1
‘ the abuse does n’t affect me on the pitch , i just think it ’s stupid			1
i ’m not an @entity8 fan , i am not from @entity128			1
if we want to be honest , we are players who look at what is in the the best interests for us and our career , ’ he says			0
in the community : @entity1 was speaking at @entity4 ’s @entity135 at @entity136 ‘ when @entity4 came , it was the best choice for me to come here			1
and today i have won trophies , i am really happy , i have everything and i have a better life			0
‘ if the fans ca n’t move on then it ’s too bad			2
but me , i am not trying to have a problem with that			0
they do what they have to do , they love their club , maybe they saw it as treason or that i betrayed them			2
but it ’s not that			0
i ’m not like that			0
‘ i just look at for what ’s best for me ; and that ’s what @entity151 did , @entity153 , @entity154			0
’ those three players have all left @entity8 for @entity4 in recent seasons , as well as @entity1 and @entity157			1
@entity1 accepts financial reasons play a part – city pay the biggest wages per player than any team in world sport – but insists it ’s not the only consideration top players take into account			1
‘ fans think it must be for the money			2
but it ’s not just the money			0
ok , it ’s a factor , it ’s important nowadays			0
but if someone earns 200 ( thousand ) a week or 150 or 100 a week , it ’s not going to make a difference or an impact on your life , so that ’s not true			0
‘ i am in debt to @entity22 at @entity8			2
if i am this player today , it is because of him			0
but i do n’t need to explain myself , what i have done with @entity4 should be enough and i do n’t have to point to it all the time			1
’ in debt : @entity1 says he is the player he is today because of former boss @entity22 @entity1 has won two @entity3 titles and a @entity185 in three seasons at @entity4 , vindication that moving to the @entity88 was the right thing do to even if sir @entity189 went on a charm offensive at the time to take him to @entity191			1
the midfielder was excellent last season , a player who benefitted from @entity195 leaving and @entity196 arriving , and now wants to improve again , particularly to help @entity4 in the @entity197 after three consecutive failures			1
a five - year contract signed this summer underlines he is firmly part of the club ’s long - term plans			0
‘ i think we have the best squad , ’ he states			0
‘ we have four strikers that i would qualify as world class – @entity207 , @entity208 , @entity94 and @entity101			0
next up : city players train in preparation for the @entity13 final at @entity15 on sunday ‘ then we have four on the wing in @entity213 , @entity214 , @entity215 and myself			1
we have @entity216 who can score 20 goals and have improved the group from last year with some players at the back which was our weakness			0
’ his club form has n’t translated onto the international stage and having been axed from the @entity225 @entity58 squad , wo n’t wear the dark blue of his country again			0
it ’s allowed his mind to focus fully on what lies ahead with @entity4			2
first up , it ’s @entity15 this afternoon			2
‘ it is not a glorified friendly , ’ he declares			0
‘ playing @entity8 is always something special and we need to show we are ready for the start of the @entity3 the following weekend			2
’ @entity1 was speaking at @entity4 ’s @entity135 at @entity136 , where he joined in to helped the @entity236 train children from local schools and sports clubs .			1

@entity1 has received abuse from @entity8 fans each time he returns to the club
@entity4 midfielder says the abuse given by fans is ' stupid '
@entity1 believes @entity27 will be the biggest threat to @entity4 again this season
