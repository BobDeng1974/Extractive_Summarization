by @entity0 published : 20:03 est , 5 september 2012 updated : 01:46 est , 6 september 2012 brave captain @entity1 before his ill - fated journey it is a tale of adventure and bravery that ended in tragedy			0
but a theory about @entity1 ’s ill - fated expedition to the @entity9 sheds a rather more sinister light on the subject			0
academic @entity12 , of the @entity14 , @entity15 , says one of the team may have eaten more than his fair share of food , leaving the others starving			1
on their way to the @entity23 , the adventurers stored depots of food and fuel to sustain them on their return journey in february 1912			1
but mr @entity12 has discovered archive material suggesting the men found less food than expected at a critical point on the way back			1
he suggests that this was because @entity34 , @entity1 ’s second - in - command and one of three men who turned back before the final stretch , ate too much food			2
starving and exhausted , @entity1 and three other men died just 18 kilometres from their final food depot			1
had they reached it , they probably would have survived			0
although it is already known that adventurers found food and fuel supplies unexpectedly low at some of the depots , mr @entity12 claims he has new evidence of a further shortage			1
he also claims that this has been hushed up over the years and that a wife of one of @entity1 ’s team erased notes her husband had made			2
his claim is based on notes from two meetings in april 1913 between @entity61 , president of the @entity64 ’s @entity63 , and the widows of @entity1 and team member @entity66			2
in the first meeting , @entity67 pointed out entries in her husband ’s diary complaining about food shortages and the ‘ lack of thoughtfulness ’ of other members of the expedition			2
@entity77 : intrepid captain @entity1 , @entity78 , @entity66 and @entity34 are pictured besides @entity80 tent on their daring journey the ' @entity82 ' , the ship that carried @entity1 on his exploration of the @entity23 in a separate meeting , @entity85 told @entity87 that her husband ’s diary contained a passage complaining of an ‘ inexplicable ’ shortage of food on the return journey on which he died			2
mr @entity61 also noted that mrs @entity85 was determined to keep the notes secret and that notes had been erased , possibly by the widow			0
mr @entity12 believes @entity66 was referring to a depot that @entity1 and the surviving men reached on 24 february 1912			1
he lays the blame with mr @entity34 , who travelled south with @entity1 but turned back alongside two other men with about 200km to go			0
captain @entity1 on board the @entity82 with some of the expedition members and crew officers and crew pose at the stern of the @entity82 , one of history 's most famous ships , in @entity109 , 1910 mr @entity34 fell ill with scurvy on the return journey and had to be pulled on a sledge by his two companions , which may explain why they needed more food			0
mr @entity12 also argues that this was all hushed up by mr @entity61			1
he said : ‘ @entity87 could not risk the story getting out			0
@entity1 and his companions had been declared heroes			0
‘ to suggest that one of the returning teams had helped themselves to more than their fair share of food , contributing to the men ’s deaths , would have changed everything			1
’ @entity1 ’s diary for february 24 mentions a significant fuel shortage and , three days later , he writes that the team had less food than they expected to have			1
mr @entity12 makes the claims in his book 1912 : the year the world discovered @entity23 , published this week			1
but @entity134 , author of a dual biography of @entity1 and his @entity137 rival @entity138 , disagrees that mr @entity34 can be blamed			0
he said : ‘ the food depots were badly organised and it would have been all but impossible for @entity34 and his men to know how much food was rightfully theirs			0
‘ it was entirely @entity1 ’s fault because of poor organisation			0
