in a tactical war - room at @entity2 's training ground – decorated with canvas prints of goal celebrations and team huddles – a sign on the wall reads : ' it is not about blame , we are all accountable '			1
@entity11 , however , wants to be accountable , he wants to be the man tasked with leading his home - town club			1
the final 13 games of this season will determine his fate on that front , but finish in the top 10 – they are currently 11th – and the job is his			1
@entity11 has 13 games left to ensure @entity2 secure a top 10 finish in the @entity22 @entity2 's @entity24 right - back @entity23 plays the ball forward at the club 's training ground @entity29 goalkeeper @entity28 dives to make a save in training ahead of saturday 's game with @entity32 earlier this week , managing director @entity33 felt moved to issue a statement urging fans to support @entity11 and the team			1
he was responding to chants of ' are you @entity39 in disguise ? ' which were aimed at the head coach during last week 's 1 - 1 draw at @entity44			1
but @entity11 is determined to prove he is his own man with his own ideas			1
in the tactics room this week he pored over video clips of the game at @entity50 with his players , comparing their performance to training - ground footage – a new initiative under @entity11 – and offering advice , criticism and praise			1
repetition is his aim until it becomes the norm			2
every time he sees @entity62 – be it in the tactics room , changing room or dining room – he reminds him that strikers only score goals in the penalty box			2
there is footage , from @entity44 , of @entity62 missing out on a certain goal as the ball drops in the six - yard area			2
he , meanwhile , is coming into frame on the edge of the box			0
then there is a clip of @entity81 pressurising defenders			0
above the head of the @entity85 striker is the name @entity87 – it is clear who @entity11 wants his @entity90 frontman to replicate when it comes to work - rate			1

but he is also open to the input of others			0
on wednesday , he sought the guidance of some 10 - year - old schoolboys at his golf club			2
' i asked one lad what his formation would be and to write down his team on a piece of paper			0
he had two defenders in a 2 - 6 - 2 system - i told him we would do that against @entity32 ! ' laughs @entity11 , who takes his side to the @entity125 on saturday afternoon			1
but there are more serious issues for him to address , such as the unrest which triggered @entity33 's call for calm			0
' when people start having a go i can half understand that , because if i was a fan in the stands i 'd be having a go myself at times , ' he says			0
' but it takes away from the importance of supporting the team			0
i 'm trying to create something here			0
' this has n't just happened , this has n't been given to me on a plate			0
i 've had to work extremely hard for it			0
' so it is important to make sure there is a relationship between me and the fans and that they understand i only want the best for this club			0
' back in the analysis room , @entity11 explains the threat which @entity32 will pose tonight , dragging their players towards @entity2 's goal at every point of attack on a magnetic tactics board			1
at the same time he shines his laser pen towards the sparsely - populated @entity32 half			2
