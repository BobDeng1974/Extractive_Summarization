imagine a future where humans are skiing on the surface of a distant moon and living in floating cities on @entity6 - while @entity5 lies in ruin			1
that ’s the future envisioned by an artist in a fantastic series of ‘ tourism ’ posters , showcasing his dream for how we might one day explore the stars			2
and he hopes the posters encourage us to expand our presence into the solar system - especially as our planet is vulnerable to cosmic disasters			1
they show how we could colonise various worlds in the solar system			1
included are humans skiing on a moon of @entity31 and living in cities on @entity34			1
others show life on @entity37 and near @entity38 - and a destroyed @entity5 ( shown ) the posters were created by artist and entrepreneur @entity23 , 28 , from @entity42 in @entity24 and his colleague @entity43			1
mr @entity23 runs an art business called @entity45 with his wife @entity46 , where each of these posters can be bought			1
all the posters seen here are hand - drawn , and then taken into @entity52 and @entity53 to finish them off			2
mr @entity23 told @entity55 his inspiration for the posters came from his love of travel , retro - style designs and a love of space			1
‘ to us , it 's reminiscent of ads that were displayed during the 60s , and seeing as that was the time of the @entity68 , it just made sense to present space posters in that medium , ’ he said			0
perhaps the most striking image is the one of @entity5 seemingly destroyed and uninhabitable			1
it ’s a future that has left many experts to recently call for more effort to be made to protect @entity5 from threats such as asteroids - and expand our presence into the solar system			1
‘ the destroyed @entity5 was big for me , ’ said mr @entity23			1
‘ i began thinking about the possibility of being hit by an asteroid - especially with the fact that a huge one just flew awfully close to us a few days ago			0
’ another poster shows humans living on the surface of @entity34 in cities , which @entity23 says he thinks is ‘ very possible ’			1
he added : ‘ i can see that happening in my lifetime			0
and i think it should			0
' on @entity97 - the closest planet to the sun - is a large crater 960 miles ( 1,550km ) wide called the @entity99 , which mr @entity23 thinks we might explore ( left )			2
colonisation of @entity34 in the form of a city , meanwhile , is something that may also be a possibility ( right ) @entity6 is known to have an @entity5 - like band in its atmosphere about 30 miles ( 50km ) above the surface , where some have said it could be possible to place floating space colonies ( shown ) @entity112 has 14 known moons , the largest of which is @entity116 , which mr @entity23 thinks we might colonise ( left )			1
maybe one day we will also return to the moon ( right ) , with a destroyed @entity5 in the background - while one of the @entity122 flags has been bleached white from radiation owing to the orbits of @entity5 and @entity34 , there are specific windows of opportunity when a mission can take place			1
our planets come as close as 33.9 million miles ( 54.6 million km ) , but can be as distant as 250 million miles ( 400 million km )			0
for this reason spacecraft to @entity34 , such as the @entity132 , have to launch in certain windows when the planets are aligned			2
the next window is open from january 2016 to april 2016 , and will see the launch of two more missions to the red planet			0
for a future manned mission , they will need to launch out in one of the windows and return in another			0
just getting there will take up to nine months			0
the astronauts will then be there waiting for a year until they can come back , again taking up to nine months - a total of around three years			0
many have wondered whether it might be possible to colonise certain corners of the solar system before			1
@entity6 , for example , is known to have an @entity5 - like band in its atmosphere about 30 miles ( 50km ) above the surface , where some have said it could be possible to place floating space colonies			2
in fact , in 1985 the @entity158 sent two balloons into the atmosphere of @entity162 1 and 2 - to provide key evidence for this potentially habitable band			0
@entity37 , meanwhile , has often been said to be a potential place to find life in the solar system - and mr @entity23 has imagined we might live there one day , too			1
@entity170 is in the process of designing its unmanned @entity173 spacecraft , which would arrive at the moon of @entity175 in the 2020s and fly through geysers erupting from its surface			0
using specialised instruments , it might be able to detect life in an underground ocean - if there is any there			2
the icy moon of @entity43 ( shown ) , meanwhile , is the smallest and innermost of the moons of @entity31			0
the gas giant planet is seen in the distance here above the horizon of the moon mr @entity23 also imagines a future where we can tour the historic @entity195 ( left ) , while @entity37 - known for its ice surface with geysers of water erupting - may one day be ' your new home ' ( right ) ‘ space exploration and essentially spreading our seed is so important , ' mr @entity23 continued			1
‘ @entity5 does not have enough resources to last all of us forever			2
we ’ve looked up at the stars for thousands and thousands of years , always wondering what they are			0
‘ and now , while we do not yet have the ability to traverse the galaxy , we do have the ability to land on other terrestrial bodies such as the moon			0
‘ and technology is getting to where we will be able to land a human on @entity34 in just ten or twenty years			2
‘ that to me is absolutely remarkable			0
if you would have told this to someone 100 years ago , they would have thought you were out of your mind			0

artist @entity23 from @entity24 created these amazing posters
they show how we might colonise various worlds in the solar system
included are humans skiing on a moon and living in cities on @entity34
others show life on @entity37 and near @entity38 - and a destroyed @entity5
