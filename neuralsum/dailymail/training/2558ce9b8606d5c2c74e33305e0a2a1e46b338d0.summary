@entity5 was attacked over his lucrative contract with @entity18 giant @entity7 , which he has accepted just ten months after retiring from his post as head of @entity21			1
experts said the move raises serious questions about the ‘ cosy ’ relationship between the revenue and big companies accused of tax avoidance			0
@entity29 , chairman of the @entity30 , accused mr @entity5 of ‘ greed ’ and ‘ losing all sense of what is right ’			1
critics said it was little surprise that the 62 - year - old had been ‘ welcomed with open arms ’ by the same firm which had helped big business avoid huge amounts of tax every year			2
@entity7 dismissed any suggestion that mr @entity5 had been hired to reveal insider secrets of how to beat the taxman and insisted there was no conflict of interest in the appointment			1
mr @entity5 ’s tenure at @entity21 , which ended last july , was dogged by claims that he helped multinational companies shave millions of pounds off their tax bills			1
he was severely criticised for brokering a deal that saved @entity55 £ 20million in interest payments			0
the deal was described by a judge last month as lawful , but ‘ not a glorious episode in the history of the revenue ’			0
another time , mr @entity5 allowed @entity10 – a @entity7 client – to pay £ 1.25billion of an alleged £ 6billion tax bill – figures which are disputed by the telecoms company			1
after being accused of lying to mps last year , mr @entity5 left @entity21 and joined @entity67 as an adviser on honesty			2
sick : @entity30 chairman @entity29 condemned the move by mr @entity5 to join @entity7 he has now accepted a one - day - a - week post with @entity7 – the firm that signed off the accounts for coffee chain @entity9 which , entirely legally , paid no corporation tax for three years by channelling its revenues through @entity78 and @entity79			1
during his time as @entity21 boss , mr @entity5 met @entity7 ’s senior @entity83 partner @entity82 48 times between 2007 and 2011 , including meetings about @entity10			1
mr @entity5 ’s appointment with @entity7 was approved by @entity87 and the advisory committee set up to monitor the ‘ revolving door ’ between @entity90 and money - spinning jobs in the private sector			1
it is subject to six caveats , including a requirement to ensure mr @entity5 does not ‘ draw on privileged information ’ from his time at @entity21			2
the @entity7 buildings in @entity100 in @entity101 , where mr @entity5 will work one day a week			1
file picture but mrs @entity29 said : ‘ does n’t it make you sick ? it is terrible when people ’s individual greed means they lose all sense of what ’s right			1
‘ he better than most knows this is n’t about paying a fair share of tax and playing by the rules			0
it is about manipulating the rules and aggressively avoiding tax			0
‘ we always called the deals he reached sweetheart deals			0
maybe now we understand why			0
’ fellow @entity123 mp @entity122 added : ‘ it should n’t be allowed			2
’ @entity125 , spokesman for the group @entity126 , which campaigns against corporate tax avoidance , said : ‘ it is no surprise @entity5 has been welcomed with open arms by a company which has helped firms like @entity9 avoid huge amounts of tax every year			1
‘ governments have for years had a far too cosy relationship with giant corporate tax dodgers and the tax avoidance industry			0
it means the @entity83 is losing out on millions of pounds of revenue which could be spent on public services			0
’ @entity142 , chief executive of the @entity143 ’ @entity144 , said : ‘ @entity146 ’s appointment does n’t look good given how the revenue appeared to reach decisions in a number of controversial cases , especially while many others were left to struggle under the weight of @entity83 ’s hideously complex tax code			0
’ @entity7 pledged that mr @entity5 ‘ will not work with @entity83 companies or with @entity21 ’ in his new role			1
a spokesman said : ‘ he will work as a consultant to @entity7 advising foreign governments and tax administrations , primarily in the developing world			1

’ advice : @entity9 and @entity10 , which have both faced questions over their tax in the @entity83 , are advised by @entity7 which has just hired mr @entity5 yesterday the @entity167 said mr @entity5 had ‘ complied with the rules ’			1
mr @entity87 ’s spokesman said : ‘ the recommendation was made by the entirely independent @entity171 , and the prime minister follows their advice			0
’ it approved the appointment subject to conditions stipulating mr @entity5 must not advise ‘ any taxpayer that he has been involved with whilst at @entity21 ’ , nor have ‘ involvement in discussions with other fiscal authorities of @entity83 ’s confidential tax policy ’			2
however , critics pointed out that a condition banning him from ‘ lobbying government ’ on behalf of @entity7 expires in july 2014			2
@entity185 , a @entity123 member of the @entity187 public administration committee , branded the advisory body ‘ a pussy cat without teeth or claws ’ and ‘ virtually completely useless ’			0
he said : ‘ it ’s not what people do when they retire that is the problem , it ’s what they did when they were in office			0
they may well take a soft line on the commercial companies that they hope to be employed by post-retirement			0
‘ the revolving door is more corrupt than the financial scandals we ’ve had			0
’ there was no answer at mr @entity5 ’s £ 800,000 home near @entity208 last night .			2
