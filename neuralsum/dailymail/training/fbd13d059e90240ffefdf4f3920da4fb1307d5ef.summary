by @entity0 for @entity1 archaeologists more accustomed to unearthing coins and jewels during digs have discovered a 2,000 - year old wooden toilet seat			1
while the artefact is less glamorous , it is perfectly preserved and incredibly rare because it is thought to be the only seat of its kind used by the @entity12 to have survived			2
the toilet seat was discovered at @entity15 fort on @entity16 in @entity17 and could have been used by soldiers stationed at the border whose job it was to keep the barbarians at bay			1
archaeologists used to unearthing treasure such as coins and jewels have discovered a 2,000 - year old wooden toilet seat			1
it is thought to be the only set made of wood that has survived since @entity32 times dr @entity33 , director of excavations at the fort , has previously dug up gold and silver or artefacts which relate to the military might of the @entity32 army , as well as everyday items like letters , shoes and babies ' booties			1
he made the discovery himself in a muddy trench which was previously filled with historic rubbish and thinks the wood survived because mud was packed tightly around it , providing oxygen - free conditions			1
there are many examples of stone and marble toilet benches from across the @entity57 but this is believed to be the only surviving wooden seat - perhaps preferred to a cold stone material given the chilly northern location loathed by many @entity32 soldiers			1
dr @entity33 discovered the toilet seat in a muddy trench ( pictured ) which was previously filled with historic rubbish and thinks the wood survived because mud was packed tightly around it the toilet seat was discovered at @entity69 ( pictured ) on @entity16 in @entity17 and was likely used by soldiers stationed at the border whose job it was to keep the barbarians at bay @entity75 was a roman fort south of @entity16 in northern @entity77			1
it guarded the roman road from the @entity80 to @entity81			0
@entity83 tablets were discovered there which are considered the most important examples of military and private correspondence found anywhere in the @entity57			0
the garrison was home to auxiliary infantry and cavalry units - not parts of roman legions			0
roman boots , shoes , armours , jewellery , coins and tablets have all been found there			0
in 2006 , a richly - decorated silver brooch featuring the figure of @entity103 was found			2
it belonged to @entity105 , a @entity106 , whose name was inscribed on the brooch			0
it was dumped near the fort which predates @entity16 , which was constructed from the early second century			2
‘ there is always great excitement when you find something that has never been seen before and this discovery is wonderful , ’ dr @entity33 said			0
‘ we know a lot about @entity32 toilets from previous excavations at the site and from the wider @entity32 world which have included many fabulous @entity32 latrines but never before have we had the pleasure of seeing a surviving and perfectly preserved wooden seat			1
‘ as soon as we started to uncover it there was no doubt at all on what we had found			0
it is made from a very well worked piece of wood and looks pretty comfortable			0
‘ now we need to find the toilet that went with it as @entity32 loos are fascinating places to excavate - their drains often contain astonishing artefacts			2
‘ let 's face it , if you drop something down a @entity32 latrine you are unlikely to attempt to fish it out unless you are pretty brave or foolhardy			0
’ the toilet seat will go on show at the fort ’s museum once it has been preserved			1
@entity75 was a roman fort south of @entity16 in northern @entity77			2
it guarded the roman road from the @entity80 to @entity81 and is where the toilet seat was found there are many examples of stone and marble toilet benches from across the @entity57 but this is believed to be the only surviving wooden seat - perhaps preferred to a cold stone material given the chilly northern location loathed by many @entity32 soldiers			1
a shot of @entity16 is pictured			0

the wooden @entity32 toilet seat is thought to be the only one of its kind
it was found at @entity15 fort on @entity16 , @entity17
oxygen - free muddy trench kept the seat in near - perfect condition
archaeologists hope to locate the actual toilet in the hope that treasures were *accidentally* dropped inside it - and are lying *undiscovered*
