@entity0 ensured their treble dreams remained alive as they overcame a first - leg defeat thanks to goals by @entity4 , @entity5 and @entity6			1
the feat was made even more impressive as the @entity0 were without key trio @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10			1
@entity0 were hit with the news that former @entity12 striker @entity8 was to miss the match due to a thigh injury just hours before kick - off , however his absence did not prove to be costly			2
@entity6 celebrates after scoring his side 's third goal of the night against @entity19 @entity0 defender @entity6 is mobbed by his team - mates after ensuring his side progressed to the final @entity5 receives a celebratory hug by @entity24 and @entity25 after doubling the scoreline @entity19 ( 4 - 4 - 1 - 1 ) : @entity27 ; @entity28 , @entity29 ( @entity30 82 ) , @entity31 , @entity32 ; @entity33 ( @entity34 66 ) , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 ; @entity38 ; @entity39 ( @entity40 73 ) subs not used : @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 booked : @entity29 , @entity36 @entity0 ( 4 - 3 - 1 - 2 ) : @entity51 ; @entity52 , @entity6 , @entity53 , @entity54 ; @entity25 , @entity55 , @entity56 ; @entity5 ( @entity57 82 ) ; @entity24 , @entity4 ( @entity58 74 , @entity59 89 ) subs not used : @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 goal : @entity4 21 , @entity5 44 , @entity69 59 booked : @entity53 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity25 sent off : @entity24 @entity71 's side came into the game knowing they had to go on the attack if they were to progress to the @entity76 final after falling to a shock 2 - 1 defeat at the @entity79			1
and the visitors did just that as @entity4 opened the scoring in the 21st minute by poking home from close range after he benefitted from a ricochet			0
@entity0 doubled the scoring shortly before the interval when @entity5 placed the ball into an empty net after @entity19 goalkeeper @entity27 parried into his path following a thunderous shot by @entity24			2
the @entity92 league leaders did not hold back during the second half and managed to kill the encounter shortly before the hour mark when unlikely goalscorer @entity6 latched onto a @entity55 corner before striking a beautifully - timed volley into the net			0
@entity55 's booking and @entity24 's bizarre red card were the only negatives of the night			0
inexperienced referee @entity101 brandished a red card in the direction of @entity24 after a clumsy challenge , which warranted nothing more than a yellow , on @entity34 with just two minutes left to play			0
@entity55 will definitely miss the final against either @entity108 and @entity109 due to an accumulation of bookings , while @entity24 should be confident of winning an appeal			2
@entity0 , who currently lie 14 points clear at the top of the @entity117 table , can now focus on their upcoming @entity119 quarter - final clash against @entity120			0
@entity19 winger @entity38 is surrounded by four @entity0 as he makes his way towards goal @entity0 celebrate after keeping their treble dreams alive by progressing to the @entity76 final @entity25 looks delighted as @entity0 set up a @entity76 final against either @entity108 or @entity109 @entity19 's supporters turned up in high numbers to see their side crash out of the @entity76			1

@entity0 reach final without @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10
the @entity0 raced into 3 - 0 lead thanks to goals by @entity4 , @entity5 and @entity6
@entity24 was sent off for *innocuous* tackle on @entity34
@entity0 will face either @entity108 or @entity109 in @entity76 final
