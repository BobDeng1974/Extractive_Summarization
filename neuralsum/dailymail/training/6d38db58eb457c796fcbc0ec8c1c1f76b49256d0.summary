half a million people will be left 20 miles from their nearest @entity1 under ‘ deeply worrying ’ plans to cut two neighbouring casualty units			1
the imminent threats are to the a&es in @entity6 and @entity7 , which between them serve at least 500,000 people in an area with a fast - growing population			2
@entity12 have drawn up the cost - cutting plans as they face a £ 30 million black hole in their @entity16 finances			1
the @entity1 in @entity6 is facing closure in ' crazy ' plans to help plug a £ 30 million hole in @entity16 finances if both units close , emergency patients will have to go to @entity22 , @entity23 or @entity24 for life - saving treatment			1
all are at least 20 miles away from both towns			1
for the past two years @entity28 has been fighting to save a&es from closure			0
the latest threats mean there are now 16 units across @entity34 facing the axe			1
both a&es could close next year , despite warnings from @entity38 , new chief executive of the @entity16 , that @entity34 ’s emergency services are already ‘ quite concentrated ’ and they should not be cut from ‘ viable local hospitals ’ without very careful thought			1
last night , politicians and health campaigners condemned the plans			2
@entity45 , @entity46 ’s prospective parliamentary candidate for @entity47 , said : ‘ i ’ve never seen the @entity16 under so much pressure here			1
right now we are in the middle of a summer @entity1 crisis in @entity6 , with record numbers turning up			1
any plan to downgrade @entity1 services here or in @entity7 is absolutely crazy			1
‘ @entity6 is one of the fastest growing areas in the country , and within ten years it will be the biggest urban area in the @entity59 outside @entity60			0
they should be expanding , not downgrading			0
’ he believed forcing sick patients to travel so far for emergency treatment would be ‘ deeply worrying ’			0
@entity63 , of the @entity64 , said she was ‘ absolutely devastated ’ to hear the town could lose its @entity1 , adding : ‘ it can easily take 45 minutes to get to @entity22 or @entity24 in the rush hour			1
that ’s not funny if you ’re in immediate need of medical attention			0
’ but she vowed : ‘ people wo n’t give up easily			2
’ the @entity1 pictured and @entity6 are just two of 16 units across @entity34 facing the axe the proposals are outlined in a new public document drawn up by @entity78 and @entity6 ’s clinical commissioning groups ( @entity79 ) , the local @entity16 authorities that pay a large chunk of the hospitals ’ bills			1
the @entity12 who run the groups have outlined 14 scenarios for the two hospitals			0
only three involve both hospitals retaining full a&es			0
eight involve one hospital retaining its @entity1 and the other ’s being downgraded to either an ‘ integrated care hub ’ or an ‘ urgent care centre ’			1
the latter would have no beds for emergency patients			0
elsewhere , some urgent care centres deal with only minor injuries at night			0
the remaining three options would see both @entity88 closed			0
the @entity12 have pitched their plans as letting ‘ the public have their say on ideas for health services ’			2
but even before consultation begins this autumn , they have effectively ruled out retaining both @entity88 , stating that ‘ sustaining emergency surgery on both sites is not sustainable ’			0
experts say there is no point having an @entity1 without being able to do emergency surgery , so both almost always get stripped out at the same time			1
at the moment both hospitals are classed as ‘ major emergency centres ’			0
a spokesman for the review said there were simply too few people in the area to justify keeping such a service at both hospitals – since guidelines suggest each of them alone requires a catchment area of about 500,000 people to be ‘ clinically viable ’			2
according to the @entity6 and @entity79 , the @entity16 in the area has a ‘ spending gap ’ of £ 30 million and growing			0
the group wants to spend more on @entity131 and community services to keep people out of hospital longer – but to pay for that they need to cut hospital services			0
downgrading @entity7 ’s @entity1 and stripping it of most emergency services is thought to be the most likely option .			2

half a million people will be left 20 miles from nearest @entity1 under new cuts
plans *blasted* as ' absolutely crazy ' by candidate for @entity47
latest closures mean there are 16 units across @entity34 facing the axe
