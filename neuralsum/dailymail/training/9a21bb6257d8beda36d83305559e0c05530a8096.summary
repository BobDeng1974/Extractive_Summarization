the government had hoped to sell shares to pension funds and long - term investors during the flotation , which was one of the largest since the days of @entity17			1
but @entity2 documents show that @entity19 , which is run by @entity4 who was once dubbed the ' locust ' for his aggressive tactics , has built up a 5 per cent holding in the company – making it the largest single shareholder			1

' the @entity76 - led government claimed that the sale would prioritise long - term investors but serious questions will be asked on whether this is the case , not least given the huge volume of trades in @entity2 shares which we have seen in the first days of trading running into hundreds of millions			2
' thanks to @entity69 , taxpayers have been left short changed to the tune of hundreds of millions of pounds at a time when families across @entity59 are facing a cost of living crisis			0
