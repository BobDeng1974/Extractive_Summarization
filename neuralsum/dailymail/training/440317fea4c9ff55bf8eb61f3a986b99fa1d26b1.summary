by @entity0 published : 07:46 est , 18 march 2013 updated : 11:26 est , 18 march 2013 curiosity has sent back an incredible panoramic image of the towering mountain which looms above the crater it has spent the last eight months exploring on the surface of @entity6			0
@entity7 rises nearly three - and - a - half miles ( 18,000ft ) from the centre of the @entity9 , making its base to peak height greater than any mountain on @entity13			1
known unofficially as @entity7 , the massive peak is an enormous layered - mound of eroded sediment rising above the crater floor location @entity1 has been exploring			1
mountain on @entity6 : this mosaic of images from the @entity20 ( @entity21 ) on @entity22 's @entity1 shows @entity7 in a white - balanced colour adjustment that makes the sky look overly blue but shows the terrain as if under @entity13 - like lighting			1
@entity28 - balanced versions help scientists recognise rock materials the lower slopes of @entity7 remain the final destination for the mission , though the rover will first spend many more weeks around a location called ' @entity36 '			1
that 's where it recently found evidence of a past environment which could have been once favourable for microbial life			0
a pair of mosaics , just released by @entity22 , assembled from dozens of telephoto images taken by @entity1 shows @entity7 in dramatic detail			1
the component images were taken by the 100 - millimeter - focal - length telephoto lens camera mounted on the right side of @entity1 's remote sensing mast on september 20 last year , the 45th @entity6 day of the rover 's mission on the @entity6			1
@entity22 has released two versions of the mosaic image			2
one has been white - balanced to show the terrain as if under @entity13 - like lighting , casting the sky as rather more blue than it really appears			2
white - balanced versions help scientists recognise rock materials based on their terrestrial experience			0
@entity22 's curiosity rover has found that @entity6 could have once supported primitive life			1
an analysis of a rock sample collected by the rover , pictured right , found key chemical ingredients			0
' we have found a habitable environment that is so benign and supportive of life , that probably if this water was around and you had been there , you would have been able to drink it , ' said @entity74 , @entity1 's project scientist			1
' a fundamental question for this mission is whether @entity6 could have supported a habitable environment , ' said @entity78 , lead scientist for @entity22 's @entity79 at the agency 's headquarters in @entity82			2
' from what we know now , the answer is yes			0
' the groundbreaking analysis by the chemical lab onboard the @entity1 rover shows ancient @entity6 could have supported living microbes			2
scientists identified sulphur , nitrogen , hydrogen , oxygen , phosphorus and carbon - some of the key chemical ingredients for life - in the powder @entity1 drilled out of a sedimentary rock near an ancient stream bed in the @entity9 last month			1
to a human observer on @entity6 , the sky over the planet would look like more of a butterscotch colour			0
a version of the mosaic with raw colour , as a typical smart - phone camera would show the scene , has also been released			0
in both versions , the sky has been filled out by extrapolating colour and brightness information from the portions of the sky that were captured in images of the terrain			0
@entity22 's @entity117 project is using @entity1 and the rover 's ten science instruments to investigate environmental history within @entity9			1
@entity7 forms the central peak within the crater and is located around 5.08 ° s 137.85 ° e , rising 5.5 km ( 18,000 ft ) high from the valley floor			2
it is about the same height as @entity127 , the tallest lunar mountain , and taller than @entity129 , which was visited by lunar explorers aboard @entity131 in 1971			0
@entity13 's highest mountain , @entity133 , by comparison , rises to an altitude of 29,000ft above sea level but is only 15,000ft base - to - peak			1
just last week @entity22 announced that analysis of a rock sample collected by the rover found key chemical ingredients that show @entity6 could once have supported primitive life			0
scientists identified sulphur , nitrogen , hydrogen , oxygen , phosphorus and carbon - some of the key chemical ingredients for life - in the powder @entity1 drilled out of a sedimentary rock near an ancient stream bed			2
the data indicated the @entity156 the rover is exploring was the end of an ancient river system or an intermittently wet lake bed that could have provided chemical energy and other favourable conditions for microbes			0
' we have found a habitable environment that is so benign and supportive of life , that probably if this water was around and you had been there , you would have been able to drink it , ' said project scientist @entity74 at the time			0
@entity78 , lead scientist for @entity22 's @entity79 at the agency 's headquarters in @entity82 , added : ' a fundamental question for this mission is whether @entity6 could have supported a habitable environment			2
' from what we know now , the answer is yes			0
' zoom right in : this zoomable panaroma shows the detail with which @entity1 's on - board cameras captured the image of @entity7 @entity133 in the @entity182 , @entity183 : the base to peak height of @entity133 is 15,000ft - 3,000ft less that @entity6 ' @entity7			1

@entity7 rises 18,000ft from the centre of the @entity9
it 's base to peak height is greater than any mountain on our planet
@entity22 says it appears to be enormous layered - mound of sediment
