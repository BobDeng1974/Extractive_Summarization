by @entity0 @entity1 has hit out at @entity2 again on wednesday night following @entity4 ’s defeat to @entity5 - this time over the point of the play - off			1
the 62 - year - old said : ' this match should never be played			1
i ’ve been saying that for 10 years - it ’s unfair			2
' the former @entity14 and @entity15 coach has changed his tune slightly since then , though			0
@entity1 does not count @entity4 ’s exit to @entity5 as a loss as the scores were level after 120 minutes			1
he therefore sees the match in @entity21 as a chance to do something @entity4 has never done before - end a @entity24 without defeat			1
' @entity4 has always lost a match in a @entity24			1
that happened in ‘ 74 and ‘ 78 ( when they made the final )			0
' i hope i can prepare them to play a good match			2
' it will be my last match and the players may want to give me a present in the form of a victory so we can leave undefeated			2
' it ’s quite something to go seven matches unbeaten			0
' answering back : @entity79 was previously incensed by comments from the @entity4 boss hair raising : the @entity42 coach speaks to @entity84 forward @entity85 during a final training session case for the defence : @entity89 ( r ) and @entity90 prepare for their final match of @entity42 2014 @entity93 moves : @entity42 players @entity94 ( r ) and @entity95 show off their skills during training forgiven ? @entity89 cradles a baby while meeting @entity42 supporters at a training session @entity1 admits it may be hard to raise spirits for the game because of the agonising nature of wednesday ’s penalty shoot - out defeat			1
' ( the defeat ) was very , very sad , ' he said			0
' a dream has been broken and this dream is not going to come back			0
' it was all about being number one so to lose this way is the most terrible way			0
' i would have rather lost 7 - 1 ( as @entity42 did against @entity46 )			1
' ' it will be my last match and the players may want to give me a present in the form of a victory so we can leave undefeated			0
' it ’s quite something to go seven matches unbeaten			0
