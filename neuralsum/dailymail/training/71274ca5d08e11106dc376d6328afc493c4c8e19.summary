by @entity0 published : 14:00 est , 26 march 2013 updated : 12:41 est , 27 march 2013 a @entity2 department store has sparked a fresh body image debate after pictures of its ' normal sized ' mannequins appeared on social networking sites			1
@entity7 , the @entity2 equivalent of @entity9 , introduced the new - look mannequins to all of its 76 stores back in 2010 - to widespread acclaim from customers - but a picture originally posted by blogger @entity16 garnered fresh interest this week after appearing on a @entity19 page claiming to be shot in a @entity21 store			1
the majority of mannequins used in clothing shops , including @entity21 , have similar proportions to catwalk models and are usually a size 8 - 10 , hence the huge interest in the ' real ' sized models			1
but the reaction online has been immense			0
so popular have the maxi mannequins proved so far , the picture has gained ' over one million likes and shares ' , according to @entity44 , and has generated comment from as far afield as the @entity46			1
' @entity44 is using mannequins in different sizes because our customers , mainly women , look different , ' explained @entity44 spokesman , @entity51			1
' we 're all proud of them because of the positive reaction [ from customers ] and because it 's good to encourage a positive body image			0
' the fashion industry has come under pressure in recent years , thanks to its use of very skinny shop dummies that do n't necessarily reflect the average woman			2
most mannequins are around 5ft 10 " tall and a size 10			0
by contrast , the average @entity66 woman is a size 16 and just 5ft 4 " tall			0
in @entity2 , the average height for a woman is 5ft 7 " and most take a size 12			0
because of the disparity between the average height and size and that of a mannequin , shop dummies have become a battleground in recent years with health and women 's rights charities lining up on one side and the fashion industry on the other			2
see the difference ? a standard shop mannequin ( left ) and one of @entity31 ' bigger ones ( right ) slim : most mannequins reflect the catwalk and are around 5ft 10 " and a size 8 or 10 ' b - eat has long campaigned for the fashion industry to reflect the diversity of shapes and sizes of mankind and we welcome any initiative that embraces this , ' says @entity104 , a spokesman for eating disorders charity , @entity106 - eat			1
' what we need is a mixture of different heights and widths of mannequins in our shops to reflect the reality of peoples ' different shapes , sizes and build			2
although the mannequins in the majority of @entity66 ’s retailers ’ windows are a size 10 they are generally taller than the average woman and with the addition of heels create an unrealistically long and lean image			2
' these images are unachievable in the main and can provide unhelpful pressure causing women to compare their own bodies unfavourably			0
' ' well done to the department store [ @entity44 ] ' , said feminist author and founder of @entity134 , @entity135			2
' there 's too much focus on one image			0
we all come in different sizes , shapes , colours and heights , and thank goodness for that ! ' @entity146 , spokesman for women 's rights charity , object , added : ' women and girls are constantly under pressure to worry about what they look like			2
' advertising , the media , music videos , video games all perpetuate the myth that , for women , to be beautiful is to be young , white or light - skinned , able - bodied and thin , pressurising women to define success by how they look rather than what they have achieved			0
' this has a negative impact on women ’s self esteem , promoting the idea that women are valued only on the basis of their appearance			0
' the introduction of more diverse mannequins would be a positive step forward in challenging sexist representations of women and the sex object culture which promotes them			0
' perhaps more pertinent , for the retailers at least , is a report in the @entity180 , which looked into the different ways in which women respond to pictures of models			0
the research found that all women , barring the very underweight , reacted negatively to images of very thin women or mannequins , and their self - esteem suffers as a result			1
' our research confirms that normal females ' self - esteem can shift upwards or downwards depending on the model they are exposed to , ' explain authors , @entity199 , @entity200 and @entity201			1
changing times : mannequins used to reflect women like @entity205			0
today , the 6ft tall @entity206 is popular ' normal females ( with @entity208 between 18.5 and 25 ) have higher levels of self - esteem when exposed to moderately thin models ( because they feel similar to these models ) and extremely heavy models ( because they feel dissimilar to these models )			1
' however , they have lower levels of self - esteem when exposed to moderately heavy models ( because they feel similar ) and extremely thin models ( because they feel dissimilar )			1
' the research , coupled with b - eat 's findings , clearly show that ultra thin mannequins and models can have a negative effect on self - esteem			1
the big question now is whether or not the @entity66 's shops will follow @entity227 ' example			0
although @entity229 has trialled size 16 mannequins - which , according to the store , were very well received - and @entity21 has said it is n't against the idea , hinting at the possibility of using them in future , it remains to be seen whether any others will follow .			1

@entity44 uses dummies in different shapes including plus sizes
the image was originally used in 2010 but has been *re-blogged*
@entity21 was *mistakenly* *credited* for using the model
charities have *slammed* skinny mannequins as bad for self - esteem
