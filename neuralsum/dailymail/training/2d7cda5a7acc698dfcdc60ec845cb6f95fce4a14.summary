by @entity0 and @entity1 he may have been seated in the vip section , but prince @entity4 showed he was no different to any other @entity6 fan as he watched the team limp to a 0 - 0 draw against @entity9 in @entity10			1
the @entity4 pulled an array of tortured facial expressions , sharing the agony of his fellow supporters , as the team failed to make an impact against a second string @entity9 side before flying home from the tournament with just a single point			1
but it was n't all bad for the royal however , as he did manage to attract the attention of several female fans in the crowd at the @entity26 in @entity27			2
fortunately he had not travelled to @entity46 just to see the game he thinks it 's all over ... it is now : @entity4 has his head in his hands as @entity6 drop out of the tournament and prepare to fly back to @entity54 the prince had been all smiles when he arrived at the stadium , and was seen proudly singing the national anthem as the teams made their way onto the pitch			2
he shook hands with some of the digintaries in the box and sat down with his private secretary , @entity65 , and with @entity66 , the governor of the state of @entity68			0
@entity70 chairman mr @entity69 and sir @entity71 , the @entity70 's director of football development who will retire after the @entity74 , sat further along the same row to the @entity4 's right			1
but as the game wore on he became visibly tense , and at one point appeared to hold his head in his hands , unable to watch the action on the pitch			0
with little riding on the game , as @entity9 had already qualified as @entity84 winners , prince @entity4 , who is rumoured to be an @entity45 fan , found himself to be the main attraction when he arrived to take his seat			2
greeting : despite his anguish , @entity4 manages to wave at the crowds of supporters inside the stadium head scratcher : @entity4 seems perplexed - could he be wondering why the @entity6 team had failed to light up the tournament ? bowing out : still holding his head , @entity4 leaves the stadium after the final whistle , with @entity6 only managing a draw handsome in a navy suit , he prince was greeted with a sea of banners , among them one held up by a @entity10 supporter teaming her yellow shirt with a veil , that made him break into a bashful smile thanks to the legend : ' @entity111 ? ' earlier , @entity4 spoke of his sadness at @entity6 's early exit from the tournament as he met children at the @entity116 before making one excited little girl giggle as he presented her with a medal , and getting between the goal posts for a penalty shoot out with another group			1
the prince was joined by @entity70 chairman @entity69 and told him that he was ' really sad ' that @entity6 had failed to progress during the tour of the athletics venue			1
' it 's a shame @entity4 did n't come last week , he probably would have helped , ' added @entity69			2
' i feel really sorry for @entity4 and our fans that we did n't have a chance of staying on - but that 's life			2
embarrassing ! prince @entity4 allows himself a bashful smile after spotting a banner asking for his hand in marriage in the crowd of fans below national anthem : prince @entity4 stands as @entity140 rings out around the stadium - the final time it will be heard during the @entity10 @entity74 future princess ? a hopeful @entity10 fan and would - be @entity147 royal holds up a banner that reads : @entity4 , @entity111 ? during the @entity6 match in @entity27 warm welcome : another @entity10 fan shows her support ... for the @entity147 prince come on @entity6 ! prince @entity4 joins the millions of @entity6 fans in the @entity147 and @entity10 hoping for at least one win during the @entity74 campaign ' it 's such small margins , we basically played better here then we have for the last two @entity161			1
' the two men chatted during a business brunch at the sports centre , where a rare copy of the original regulations for football - drawn up in 1863 - was on show before being presented to the @entity170 football museum at a later date			0
' the couple of games that i watched i thought that we played really well , ' said prince @entity4			0
' it 's the best @entity6 team we 've had for some time - but hey , you win some you lose some			0
' and squeal ! prince @entity4 sits down for a team photo with a group of tiny @entity10 footballers during his tour of an athletics facility in @entity27 come on @entity6 ! despite @entity6 's @entity74 woes , prince @entity4 managed to put a brave face on during a visit to the @entity116 much safer ! prince @entity4 was challenged to a fight by judo champion @entity186 but chose to battle it out in a basketball match instead joking around : @entity4 seemed to enjoy himself as he pressed the start button for an exhibition race between a group of young swimmers at the club giggles : a young swimmer bursts into laughter as prince @entity4 approaches with a medal in his hand during his visit to the @entity116 more @entity6 hopes bite the dust ! despite talking up his football skills , prince @entity4 found himself on the receiving end of a drubbing by a young @entity10 footballer not penalties ! like an @entity6 goalkeeper confronted with a @entity209 striker , prince @entity4 proved no match for a group of @entity10 children during a shoot out back of the net ! a little boy celebrates putting one past the royal visitor who seemed to take defeat in his stride ( well , he is used to it ! ) you win some , you lose some ! after last night 's @entity10 vs @entity223 game , prince @entity4 will cheer on @entity6 in their final @entity74 game tonight much better : luckily for @entity4 , his basketball skills proved considerably more impressive than his goal - keeping the prince , who is on a seven - day tour of @entity10 and @entity229 , and mr @entity69 were shown around the facility which is set to be the base for @entity233 athletes during the @entity234 , by @entity235 - the winner of @entity10 's only @entity237 swimming gold medal			1
originally intended to be used as a zoo , the vast club has more than 1,000 athletes on its books , a huge swimming pool and its own stadium , the @entity244			0
among the @entity147 athletes likely to be selected for @entity10 are @entity246 , @entity247 and @entity248 - all of whom racked up @entity237 gold medals in their events during the @entity253			0
one man who is unlikely to be spotted on the track , however , is prince @entity4 who made headlines during a visit to @entity258 after he played fast and loose with the rules to win a sprint against @entity261			2
is that for me ? a young swimmer looks bashful as prince @entity4 presents her with a gold medal not racing this time ? @entity4 was shown around by @entity235 , @entity10 's sole @entity237 swimming gold medallist that 's how it 's done : @entity235 passes on a few pointers to the prince as he shows him around the complex royal inspection : the @entity116 will be the base for @entity233 during the 2016 @entity237 and they 're off ! prince @entity4 does the honours for one group of swimmers during a practice race @entity278 to meet you ! prince @entity4 looked thrilled as he was greeted by children waving @entity10 and @entity147 flags hello there : a little girl beams as she is presented with a medal by the prince but her friend looks unimpressed as the sprinter waited for the starting whistle , the prince sped off , leaving the unsuspecting bolt trailing in his wake - much to the amusement of watching locals			1
this time around , @entity4 confined himself to presenting medals and indulging in a few jokes and a chat with young athletes , although he did shoot some hoops with a @entity10 judo star			0
the prince turned down an offer to grapple with @entity186 who is hoping to win a medal when his country hosts the next @entity237 , and battled it out for the honours on the basketball court instead			0
when @entity4 's first shot hit the rim of the hoop and bounced away he waved his hand in mock disgust and walked off			0
two further efforts were also off the mark but the judo player 's aim was just as bad			0
@entity186 joked afterwards : ' my ability with the basketball and @entity4 's was not good we both need to practice			0
' later , the prince will be driven to the @entity26 for @entity6 's dead rubber match against @entity9 , who are already in the second round			1
tomorrow , as the @entity322 fly home , @entity4 will continue on to @entity10 's largest city @entity170 , where he will meet conservationists campaigning to save the @entity327 rainforest and disadvantaged local children			1
one , two , three ... scream ! prince @entity4 was met by hordes of overexcited girls as he arrived at the @entity116 in @entity27 hello there ! the prince knelt down for a chat with some of the smaller children in the crowd and swoon ! @entity27 's teenagers gave prince @entity4 the sort of reception usually afforded to the likes of boyband one direction excited : the stands and balconies at the @entity116 were packed with girls , all hoping to get a good photo of @entity4 past form : a sneaky prince @entity4 cheats to win a race against @entity261 during his 2012 tour of @entity258 friends : luckily for the prince , there were no hard feelings and both went on to do the ' @entity261 '			1

tense prince displayed a range of *emotions* as @entity6 limped to a 0 - 0 draw against @entity9
at one point he held his head in his hand as @entity6 dropped out of the @entity74 with a single point
@entity4 was greeted by a banner that read : ' @entity366 ? on his arrival at the @entity26 in @entity27
earlier , the prince visited the @entity116 and was joined by @entity70 chairman @entity69
@entity372 was shown around the club , which will host @entity233 in 2016 , by @entity10 star swimmer , @entity235
during his visit confessed to being ' really sad ' about @entity6 's early @entity74 exit
the @entity322 are expected to fly home this week while prince @entity4 continues on to @entity170
@entity4 was greeted by @entity383 style crowds of swooning female fans in @entity27
