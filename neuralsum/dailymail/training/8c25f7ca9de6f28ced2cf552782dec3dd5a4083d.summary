have you ever thought about how you would survive if the nation , or even the world , faced a disaster ? for many @entity5 , the question is simply an uncomfortable thought , but for a small section of society , known commonly as ' preppers ' , it is a driving passion			1
despite the hype around the term which may call into mind doomsday preachers or conspiracy fanatics , the close - knit community want to be known simply as regular people who are prepared - very prepared			1
' being a prepper is no more crazy than buying a first aid kit , its just a sensible thing to do , ' said @entity18			1
' in general , i live a relatively ' normal ' life , but prepping tends to make me more aware of my surroundings and the possible things that can go wrong , ' he said			0
after becoming interested in world politics a decade ago , @entity18 became increasingly fascinated with events that could end society - nuclear war , financial collapse , electrical grids shutting down , water running out			1
he became convinced that it was only a matter of time before some sort of disaster happened in @entity5 , and decided to prepare for the imminent event			1
@entity18 said he is a ' regular guy ' , and sees prepping as something sensible to protect himself and his dog @entity49 ( right ) for who he has a baby holster for her to sit in when he is bush tracking @entity18 with his ' bug out bag ' filled with necessities in case of an emergency or natural disaster while @entity18 is prepared for large - scale catastrophes and smaller natural disasters such as bushfires or earthquakes , he does n't put much stock in the fear of some in the community who predict the @entity67			1
' there are preppers who are seriously preparing for a zombie apocalypse , but personally i think that ’s absurd , ' @entity18 said			2
@entity74 , another prepper who chronicles his cross-country travels , said that prepping is ' all about being ready to deal with the curve balls that life can throw at you , ' ' in other words take responsibility for your own wellbeing			2
there are hundreds of likely events like power outages or job losses that can befall any of us			0
' @entity90 and zombies , think " company restructure " or " backhoe cuts power lines " , ' said @entity74			0
after working in a corporate environment for many years , @entity74 decided to go off the grid , ' returning to a simpler more independent and self - sustaining lifestyle			0
' @entity18 's unit has prepping items including batteries , supplies of food and water , world - band radios , and first aid ' there are preppers who are seriously preparing for a zombie apocalypse , but personally i think that ’s absurd , ' @entity18 said ' being a prepper is no more crazy than buying a first aid kit , its just a sensible thing to do , ' said @entity18 for him , prepping simply seems like a logical step to take in order to protect himself and his loved ones against the possibility of a disaster			1
' why should n't people be preppers ? they prepare for the chance of a flat tyre by having a spare , they prepare for the chance of a house fire by holding insurance , ' @entity74 pointed out			2
' these are very infrequent events , and yet almost everyone prepares for them			0
so why not prepare for events such as a pandemic , a financial collapse or even just a cyclone or flood ? ' @entity74 said that he viewed the economy as a very fragile system which could be easily upended by a disaster , as most people source their food from companies who have it imported from thousands of kilometers away			1
' what happens when the trucks ca n't deliver the food because the power grid has failed , and diesel is n't available ? ' he asked			0
' after about three days the supermarket shelves will be empty and people will start looking for food			2
you are better off not being one of those people			0
' @entity18 agreed , saying that without power society would quickly deteriorate into chaos , which is why he has identified three main areas of prepping : bugging in , bugging out , and everyday carry items			0
' bugging in ' means ' staying put in your place of residence in an emergency or disaster ' and ' bugging out ' means ' leaving your place of residence in an emergency or disaster , typically to a bug out location ( @entity174 ) , a predetermined location that has a clean and plentiful water source , and is private and secure , ' said @entity18			1
@entity18 's ' bug out vehicle ' ( @entity179 ) , a specially designed bicycle with a 1000 watt electric hub motor with 100 kilometre range ' in a true @entity182 ( @entity184 @entity183 ) scenario , driving a car would be useless , because the roads would be grid locked			0
here in @entity190 , on a normal day , the roads are close to grid locked in peak hour , ' @entity18 said @entity18 's specially modified bicycle has a pet basket for @entity49 , his 12 - yeat - old chihuaua @entity18 's ' bug out bag ' , a pack which contains all the esential items he would need in case of an emergency , is one of his most prized possessions			1
from army - grade energy bars and cooking devices , to weapons , a world - band radio , a first aid kit , and a complete survival manual , the bug out bag stays in his ' bug out vehicle ' ( @entity179 ) , a specially designed bicycle with a 1000 watt electric hub motor with 100 kilometre range			1
' in a true @entity182 ( @entity184 @entity183 ) scenario , driving a car would be useless , because the roads would be grid locked			0
here in @entity190 , on a normal day , the roads are close to grid locked in peak hour			0
' ' imagine just a small disaster , it would be chaos , let alone a full blown emergency			2
so , that said , i plan on using my @entity179 '			0
@entity74 said that preppers are often depicted as ' tin - foil - hat - wearing paranoids , ' and though he admitted that a minority may be fanatics , ' most are just providing their own insurance against whatever may happen in their lives , ' an attitude he encourages others to adopt. @entity18 's unit uses every inch of his living room and bedroom for his prepping gear @entity18 has created machines in anticipation of a disaster , and is seen here with his mobile solar panel ' figure it out now , not after there 's a disaster , ' @entity74 said			1
even for those who are n't interested in becoming preppers , both men insist that some level of preparation is essential			2
' it is n’t everyone ’s cup of tea to be prepared for the @entity67 , but there are small things people should do , things that wo n’t impact on their everyday life , like having 3 to 4 months supply of food and water			1
and a first aid kit , ' said @entity18			1
' depending on where you live , you should at least be prepared for likely local disasters			2
like far north @entity266 should be prepared for a cyclone			0
or someone in a bush fire prone area should be prepared for a bush fire			0
' @entity74 said that it was a good idea to consider being prepared for the most likely scenarios , to store some food and water that would last at least a few days			2
' buy a small generator so you do n't lose everything in the fridge if the power fails and you can charge you phone , and maybe pick up a 50 - cal @entity281 to fend off the zombies ... just kidding			0

' @entity284 ' are a tight - knit community of people who are taking measures to ensure that they are prepared for disaster or emergency
despite a few fanatics , preppers insist they are regular @entity5 who are simply more prepared
the head of @entity19 said : ' being a prepper is no more crazy than buying a first aid kit , its just a sensible thing to do '
they are preparing for everything from nuclear war , financial collapse , electrical grids shutting down , and water running out to natural disasters
preppers *recommend* storing food and water in case of an emergency , and say that a large - scale disaster ' will happen '
