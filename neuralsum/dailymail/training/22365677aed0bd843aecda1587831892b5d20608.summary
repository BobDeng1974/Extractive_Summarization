@entity0 have just missed out on a place among the top seeds for next summer 's @entity3 despite making a considerable leap in the latest @entity6 rankings			1
@entity8 's team qualified for the tournament this week by finishing top of their group and have jumped seven places in the rankings to 10th , but it is not enough for them to make pot one for the finals draw on december 6			2
hosts @entity18 , who are 11th in the rankings , are automatically seeded , while @entity25 ( first ) , @entity26 ( second ) , @entity21 ( third ) , @entity22 ( fourth ) , @entity23 ( fifth ) and @entity24 ( seventh ) are also definitely in the top pot. close : @entity0 narrowly missed out on a position among the top seeds 1 @entity30 @entity31 ( level on points with @entity34 ) 10 england11 brazil12 chile13 usa14 @entity35 @entity36 ( sixth ) will be the other seeded side if they beat @entity38 in a two - legged play - off , but if the @entity41 lose , the last seeding place will go to @entity34 , who are joint - eighth in the rankings with @entity43			1
the @entity44 will be sourly disappointed not to have made pot one , having failed to lose a game in an impressive qualifying campaign			0
the @entity48 , who also completed their @entity3 qualifying group unbeaten to reach the finals for the third time in a row , leaped seven places thanks to their wins over @entity57 and @entity58 this month			1
@entity43 had been fourth but paid dearly for drawing 2 - 2 at home to @entity60 on tuesday			0
@entity0 might have been placed higher , but @entity61 and @entity62 were ranked low because they hosted the @entity63 in 2012			0
@entity6 previously ruled that @entity18 ( ranked 11th on thursday ) plus the top seven ranked teams would be seeded for the draw at the @entity67 tropical beach resort in december			2
@entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 and @entity62 will be the seeded teams in next monday 's draw for the @entity74 zone playoff round , which also features @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 and @entity78			2
rankings leaders @entity25 , the reigning world champions , are the only non-movers in the top 10 , while @entity26 have replaced @entity21 in second place and @entity43 have fallen four positions			1
big guns : @entity0 could face top seeds @entity21 in their group after the @entity41 ' campaign ones to avoid : hosts @entity18 are also among the top seeds on their own turf @entity68 could draw fellow @entity74 giants @entity75 in the @entity3 draw after the two teams were put into separate pots			1
pot one : @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity62 pot two : @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 the draw for the two - legged play - offs will take place on monday meanwhile , @entity0 manager @entity8 clearly does not mind if his team goes under the radar in @entity18 , and will use the shock @entity100 triumphs of @entity69 and @entity102 as evidence that the team should not give up on their @entity3 dream			1
' it 's pretty obvious we 're not favourites , ' said @entity8			0
' the main contenders are @entity18 , @entity21 , @entity25 and @entity26 i guess			1
' is it possible for a @entity74 team to win in @entity18 ? they have n't done yet but anything is possible is n't it ? ' no one thought @entity69 would win the euros in @entity68 ( in 2004 ) or for @entity102 to get their players off the beach in 92 , but they did			0
' every year it gets that little bit harder to look beyond the favourites but i am pretty sure all the @entity74 teams will be hoping to become the first one to reverse the trend			0
' we will go with the same attitude			0
' impressive : @entity128 ( centre ) and @entity24 had a strong qualifying campaign blow : @entity132 ( centre ) and @entity43 dropped out of the top seeds after a costly draw in qualifying			0

@entity24 leap seven places after wins over @entity58 and @entity57
@entity18 , @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity25 is top seeding pot for @entity3 draw
eighth place goes to @entity34 if @entity36 lose play - off against @entity38
@entity0 move from 17th to 10th in @entity6 rankings but will be in pot two
big guns @entity75 and @entity68 could draw one another in play - offs
