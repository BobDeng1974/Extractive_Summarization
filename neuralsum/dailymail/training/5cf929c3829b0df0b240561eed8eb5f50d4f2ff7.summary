by @entity0 published : 15:13 est , 6 march 2013 updated : 15:36 est , 6 march 2013 three conmen who duped investors into paying thousands of pounds for worthless plots of land by telling them they would be used for the @entity5 have been found guilty of fraud			1
@entity7 , 29 , @entity8 , 30 , and @entity9 , 29 , told buyers they were selling valuable plots around @entity12 - including some which would be developed as part of the @entity5 in 2012 - which would eventually deliver huge profits			1
but in fact the land invariably turned out to be either low - value farm land , in the @entity19 or unlikely to be granted planning permission			1
in total , more than 400 investors from across @entity12 parted with £ 35million in one of the biggest ' landbanking ' frauds to date			1
conmen : @entity7 , left , and @entity8 , right , used fake names and set up front companies to carry out the ' landbanking ' fraud for five years @entity9 named himself gave himself the false name @entity30 in reference to the @entity33 star the fraudsters used false names and front companies to carry out the scam between 2005 and 2010 , claiming their telesales headquarters in @entity38 was selling gym memberships			1
@entity8 called himself @entity40 and even set up a front company @entity42 , named after himself and his alter - ego			2
@entity9 named himself after @entity33 star @entity30 while @entity7 gave himself the surname ' legend '			1
the trio were today found guilty of fraud following a two month trial at @entity49			1
ringleader @entity50 , 30 , earlier admitted conspiracy to defraud investors			2
all three were remanded in custody ahead of their sentencing on friday			0
judge @entity56 said : ' you can expect a severe sentence in relation to these matters			2
' earlier in the trial , prosecutor @entity61 told the jury : ' investors were persuaded to buy the plots by various high - pressure sales techniques , typically by cold - calling			1
' they puffed up the value of the plots of land , and making representations that planning permission was being obtained or that a blue - chip purchaser is interesting in purchasing the land			1
' promises were made that the investor could sell the land back to the marketing company			0
' in fact , the land being sold invariably turn out to be low value farm land or forestry , divided into dozens of tiny plots to be sold on at hugely inflated prices			1
' much of it was in the green belt or in other areas where the grant of planning permission was extremely unlikely ' , said mr @entity61			1
' no applications for planning permission had in fact been made			1
' false promises : the conmen convinced investors the land was needed as part of plans to build the @entity99 and @entity100 in @entity101 among other lies those who tried to reclaim their investment were told exorbitant extra sums needed to be paid to recoup the money			1
one plot in @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110 , which was bought from @entity111 for £ 80,000 , was divided into 220 mini plots valued at just £ 363.63 each			2
the con artists then set about selling each plot for £ 10,000 a piece , promising rich rewards to investors and drawing up a brochure showing a ' wholly unrealistic ' housing project			2
the scam used front companies including @entity122 , @entity123 , @entity124 , and @entity125 , all of which were linked to the same office on the 29th floor of an office block in @entity38			0
cancer sufferer @entity130 and his wife @entity131 were among those sucked into the scheme , investing a total of £ 628,013 in @entity123 after being promised hefty profits in return for buying land			2
the retired couple from @entity139 , @entity140 , were first approached in march 2005 by @entity8 posing as @entity40			2
they were persuaded to part with more than £ 220,000 for plots in @entity143 , @entity110 , @entity144 , @entity145 , in @entity146 , @entity147 in @entity148 , and @entity149 in @entity150			2
rip - off : the conmen sold mini-plots of land on @entity107 in @entity109 , @entity110 , for £ 10,000 each when they were valued at just £ 363.63 the couple had received titles for the land but seen no return by november 2007 , but were urged to buy more land in @entity160 , in @entity110			1
' they were expecting @entity122 to take steps to get planning permission and for an opportunity to sell at a profit when the land was snapped up by a developer ' , said mr @entity61			1
by march 2009 , the @entity168 were growing anxious but were met with excuses over the delay and encouraged to invest another £ 17,500 in the @entity109 site			0
@entity9 , as @entity30 , then told the couple some of their land was being bought up by an @entity176 investor , but another £ 100,000 was needed to seal the deal			1
the conmen strung them along with claims they were ' privileged clients ' , asking for increasing sums of money to ensure their investment returned a profit , until eventually they refused to pay any more and were told the money could not be returned			0
' mrs @entity186 felt that they had to keep paying or that they would lose everything ' , said mr @entity61			0
' they had been promised financial returns and got nothing			0
' they had been strung along and persuaded to make more and more payments			0
' landbanking fraud has become increasingly prevalent in recent years			0
companies divide land into smaller plots and sell it to investors on the basis that once it is available for development it will soar in value			2
fraudsters will use high - pressure sales tactics by cold - calling names and numbers from publicly - available shareholder lists			0
they can also use email , post , word of mouth or talk at a seminar or exhibition			0
in fact , the land is often in areas of natural beauty , historical interest or has little chance of being built on and the people behind these companies are actually highly - skilled criminals			0
the @entity221 estimates landbanking schemes have so far cost @entity12 investors more than £ 200million			1
although not all landbanking schemes are a scam , it is often not made clear to investors that there are restrictions on the development of the land or that it is otherwise protected			2
they offer this advice on how to protect yourself : - contact the local council where the land is located and asking them whether the land might ever be released for development			0
just because the person promoting or operating the scheme says it is guaranteed the land will be developed does not necessarily mean it will be			0
- if you have already invested in a scheme and are concerned , stop sending money to the firm and individuals involved			0
if you have given them your bank account details , tell your bank immediately			0
- contact the @entity254 with as much information as you can about your investment and the company involved , including their contact details and ‘ firm reference number ’ ( @entity261 )			0
source : the @entity221 ( @entity221 ) the scam eventually unravelled after probes by police , trading standards , and the @entity221 , as well as 2010 exposes in the @entity267			0
@entity268 showed plots of land in @entity271 , @entity272 , @entity273 , @entity274 , @entity275 , @entity276 , and @entity277 , were used in the scam , all of which were either green belt land or had no planning permission			1
raids of the trio 's homes revealed a host of fake passports , paperwork under aliases , and details of their victims			0
@entity9 's home computer had been used to search on @entity292 for ' @entity293 ' as the net tightened on the gang			2
the ringleader of the fraud is believed to have fled the country and is currently on the run			0
@entity9 , @entity8 , and @entity7 are now facing hefty spells behind bars after being found guilty of conspiracy to defraud			1
@entity9 , @entity7 and @entity8 , all of @entity304 , @entity110 , had denied the charges but were found guilty following a two - month trial			1
