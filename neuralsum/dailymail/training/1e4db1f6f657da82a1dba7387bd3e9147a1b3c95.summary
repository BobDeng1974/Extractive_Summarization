there is something about black and white photography that can instantly transport you back in time			2
their subjects often appear shrouded in mystery , with grey shading making them appear part of a shadowy world very different to the one we live in today			2
now a group of artists have begun drawing the dark veil back from these figures , to bring them out of the murky past and into vivid reality			2
digital artists are reviving the lost art of photo colourisation , which has been around for more than 175 years			1
pictured is ' the march on @entity21 ' that took place on 28 august 1963 in @entity21 as part of civil rights movement			0
here @entity25 gave his famous ' @entity27 ' speech the artists , many of which have become popular on @entity32 threads , are reviving the lost art of photo colourisation , which has been around for more than 175 years			1
' many people do n't know that colour photography dates as far back as the craft of photography itself , ' said @entity38 a student from @entity40 , who runs the popular @entity42			2
' we 're not trained to recognise objects in black and white , but seeing these images in colour completely negates that and we 're suddenly able to connect with that photograph			1
' we feel as if we 're there with those people , experiencing it			0
' from the moment the first photo was taken by @entity52 in 1826 , photographers began experimenting with ways to try and bring true - to - life colour into the frame			1

then , in 1861 , the first colour photo made its debut by @entity83 , a @entity84 mathematical physicist , when he snapped a photo of a tartan ribbon			1
meanwhile , in @entity89 a photographer named @entity88 used his training as a painter and lithographer to create shashin abura - e or ' photographic oil paintings '			1
the process involved cut cutting away the paper support of the photo and applying pigment to the emulsion with a drying oil , claims @entity101			2
today , while oil paintings , dyes and watercolours are still used to bring black and white images to life , technology allow more accurate ways of recapturing colour			1

pictured is colourised image of actor @entity115 originally photographed by @entity116 , a street photographer who is known for her candid shots of @entity119 life throughout the 1940s and 1950s ' most of us use @entity123 - i use @entity125 with a @entity127 tablet			1
that being said , there are many examples of people using @entity132 , or @entity135 - whatever you use , it 's all about the technique , rather than the program , ' said artist @entity38			0
' i liken colourisation to the game of @entity140			0
simple to pick up but extremely difficult to master and i have a very long way to go , ' added artist @entity143 when speaking with @entity79			2
' the basic formula in its variations is straightforward : just keep adding layers of colour onto the black and white image , and mask it off ' between the lines '			2
the more colour variation you add , the more ' real ' the final image is perceived to a point ( then you 're hitting diminishing returns )			2
' ' most of us use @entity123 , ' said mr @entity38 told the printing firm , who carried out extensive interviews with the artists			1

' the artists use the software to add layers of colour onto the black and white image , and blend the colours between the lines			1
but part of it is guesswork			0
' you make educated guesses much of the time , but those guesses are informed by a laborious level of research into the visual and historical context of the photograph , ' said @entity143 is a colour restoration expert who works for @entity193			1
' if people find this pretentious or overkill , then they 're missing the point , because @entity196 was n't ever photographed wearing a bright purple jacket			0

not everyone is convinced that colourising the history is a worthwhile endeavour not everyone is convinced that colourising the history is a worthwhile endeavour			0
despite the historical research put in , some claim it 's an insult to history as artists can never really know the true colour photographed			1
despite the dissenters , many artists claim they 've also received positive feedback from those who are able to appreciate the photos in a new and personal way			0
' people are enamoured with well colourised image because it makes an abstract concept , ' the bygone era in black and white ' , and renders it into a concept we all understand : well defined colour , ' said @entity238 who blogs at @entity239			0
' i 've heard my own work described as a ' visceral experience ' or ' relatable '			0
as one colouriser put it on his website , ' we do n't live in a black and white world , neither did they '			0

artists are reviving art of photo colourisation which is 175 years old
