an inmate who was killed in a ' horror movie - style ' botched execution last year chatted with prison guards and even suggested a vein in his leg for his lethal injection , new documents have revealed			1
@entity8 , who shot and buried alive @entity9 , 19 , in 1999 , was scheduled to be put to death by an untested cocktail of three drugs , including midazolam , in @entity14 on april 29			1
but after medical officials repeatedly failed to set up an intravenous line - ultimately , pumping the drugs into his femoral artery , causing them to leak into his tissue - he took 43 minutes to die			1
now , newly - released transcripts of interviews with officials inside the state 's death chamber have revealed grisly details of the moments leading up to the ' bloody mess ' that was @entity8 's death			1
the interviews , which are among 5,000 pages of documents unveiled by the @entity46 , show @entity8 causally chatted with the paramedic who was inserting his iv line			2
he told the paramedic his arm was scarred from previous drug use , but there still was a viable vein in it			0
' and he said if you will go right above the scars , i have a good vein , ' the paramedic said			0
although the official took @entity8 's advice and successfully inserted the needle , they did not have the right kind of tape to hold the line in place , so it came loose , according to the interview transcripts			1
@entity8 , a former intravenous crystal meth user who had dehydrated himself for three hours for the execution , then suggested that officials insert the needle through his leg instead , @entity67 reported			2
' he said , ' i 've got a vein in my leg , my right leg , ' the medic recalled in an interview			2
' and i said , " well , i do n't like to do those because they cause a lot of clots "			0
' he said , " does it really matter ? " ' @entity83 njection : @entity8 was scheduled to be put to death at @entity85 ( above ) ) by an untested cocktail of three drugs , including the sedative midazolam , on april 29			1
but after medical officials failed to set up his intravenous line - ultimately , pumping the drugs into his femoral artery - he took a huge 43 minutes to die lethal : now , newly - released transcripts of interviews with officials inside the death chamber have revealed gthe moments leading up to @entity8 's death			1
above , one of the drugs used in the execution , midazolam officials ultimately chose to put the iv into @entity8 's femoral vein through his groin , using a 1.25in needle that appeared to be too short for the procedure - the recommended length was 2.5in			1
' well , we 'll just have to make it work , ' the doctor told the concerned medic , the transcripts state			0
by the time the second drug , a paralytic , was pumped into @entity8 , it was clear something was wrong			2
the inmate , who was apparently ' very talkative until they raised the curtain ' in his execution and then he shut up ' , had been declared unconscious , but he suddenly started writing in agony			0
' one of the executioners said , " he 's trying to get up off the table " and i thought , " what ? " ' said the medic , who has not been identified			0
' the warden was very upset			0
nobody wants a prisoner in an execution situation to suffer			0
' @entity8 , 38 , also began clenching his teeth and groaning loudly , prompting officials to try unsuccessfully to stop the execution			2
more than 43 minutes after the killing began , @entity8 died			1
death row inmates typically take just 10 minutes to die from a lethal injection			1
the cocktail of drugs that @entity8 had been injected with had not been previously used in the @entity40			2
other witness interviews , unveiled to the @entity142 after the @entity143 successfully filed a lawsuit against authorities , also laid bare the scale of the fiasco surrounding @entity8 's execution			1
some witnesses said the killing resembled a scene from a ' horror movie '			2
meanwhile , prison warden @entity154 described it as a ' bloody mess ' as the inmate bucked up from the gurney when he was meant to be unconscious , the @entity153 reported			2
halted : after @entity8 's execution went awry , gov @entity158 ordered a halt to the second scheduled killing of @entity161 ( left ) , who sexually assaulted and killed 11 - month - old baby @entity163 ( right ) in 1997 @entity164 released a 32 - page summary of its investigation in september , which blamed most of the execution 's problems on a failed single iv line in @entity8 's groin			1
however , the agency did not release the documents connected to its probe until after the @entity143 's lawsuit			0
the investigation revealed a failed line caused the drugs to be administered locally instead of into @entity8 's blood , but the doctor overseeing the execution did not notice a problem with the site			1
this is because @entity8 's lower body was covered with a sheet , the transcripts state			1
the documents also reveal that the newly hired executive director of the @entity189 , @entity190 , was concerned about his lack of involvement in the execution preparations			0
prison warden : @entity154 ( pictured ) described @entity8 's execution as a ' bloody mess ' as the inmate bucked up and groaned on the gurney @entity190 told investigators he did n't even know the agency had acquired the drugs for the execution until he learned it from the media			1
' i found out that they had found a pharmacist and the drugs , uh through a news report , ' @entity190 said , according to a transcript of his interview			0
the testimony of @entity190 and others involved in the execution suggest there was nervousness and unease with two executions scheduled on the same night using a new three - drug formula that had n't been used in @entity14 before			2
' these were particularly concerning to me , ' @entity190 said			0
' a new protocol , one i was not familiar with really			0
' indeed , the unidentified paramedic recalled : ' there was an air of urgency there			0
the " quick quick , got to get it done , got to get it done and got to make sure that everything is done right "			0
' after @entity8 's execution went awry , gov. @entity158 ordered a halt to the second scheduled execution of @entity161 , who raped and murdered an 11 - month - old girl in 1997			1
@entity161 was executed nearly nine months later , on @entity232 , using the same three drugs in @entity8 's execution , but with a five-fold increase the amount of the first drug , midazolam			1
since @entity161 's execution , the @entity40 @entity39 has agreed to consider a challenge to the new three - drug method from a group of @entity14 death row inmates who claim the sedative wo n't properly render them unconscious before the second and third drugs are administered			1
a legal brief in that case filed this week by 16 pharmacology professors at @entity40 universities states that midazolam is incapable of rendering an inmate unconscious and is an inappropriate first drug to use			0
the court is scheduled to hear arguments in the case on april 29			0
@entity190 and other state officials have publicly acknowledged midazolam is not the preferred drug for lethal injection , but one that was selected when other more effective , drugs became unavailable			2
because manufacturers refused to sell them to states for use in executions			0
all execution officials ' names and identifying information were redacted from the @entity164 records .			0
