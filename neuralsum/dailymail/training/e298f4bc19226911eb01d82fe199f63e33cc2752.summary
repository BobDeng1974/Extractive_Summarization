advertisements for @entity1 featuring glamour model @entity2 have been banned for degrading women and treating them as sex objects			1
the lads mag model was seen wearing very little and flashing her cleavage in a series of provocative video ads that hark back to the 1970s			2
the deodorant is made by multi-national manufacturer , @entity9 , which is in the dock for sanctioning the images and demeaning women			1
' demeaning ' : @entity2 in one of the @entity1 adverts which the @entity16 says goes too far ' highly unsuitable for children ' : the @entity16 found the adverts crossed the line and are offensive to many @entity1 is marketed using tongue in cheek humour that suggests the men who use it instantly become more attractive , with beautiful women falling at their feet			1
however , in a ruling published today , the @entity16 ( @entity16 ) has accused the company of going too far			1
one internet video ad showed the model getting dressed , washing a car and eating an ice lolly			2
in each scene she was wearing different outfits all of which revealed her cleavage			0
a second showed the model stripping wallpaper , jogging , applying lip gloss , eating whipped cream off her finger and playing with a light sabre			0
on display near schools : another poster featuring a different model showering on a beach in just her bikini bottoms drew more than 100 complaints this @entity1 advert for anti-perspirant has got a watchdog hot under the collar a third featured various close ups of her cleavage , while on - screen text invited viewers to ‘ play with @entity2 ’ and gave the @entity1 website address			0
a fourth featured an image of the model in her underwear and bending over an oven door			0
the text stated ‘ can she make you lose control ? ’			0
a poster for the product , which featured another model taking a shower on a beach and wearing only bikini bottoms , drew more than 100 complaints with many upset that it was put up close to schools			0
it carried two controversial straplines , reading : ‘ the cleaner you are the dirtier you get ’ and ‘ @entity82 ’			0
in a ruling published today , the watchdog said : ‘ we considered that the various activities that ms @entity2 carried out were presented in a sexually provocative way , and that alongside the focus on ms @entity2 's cleavage … were likely to be seen as gratuitous and to objectify women			1
‘ we considered that was emphasised by the text ‘ can she make you lose control ? ’ … and the invitation to ‘ play with @entity2 ’ , which we considered would also be seen as degrading to women			1
‘ we therefore concluded that the ads were likely to cause serious and widespread offence			1
’ criticising the poster , the @entity16 said the language was ‘ clearly intended to imply that using the advertised product would lead to more uninhibited sexual behaviour ’			1
it added : ‘ we therefore considered that the poster would be seen to make a link between purchasing the product and sex with women and in so doing would be seen to objectify women			1
’ the @entity109 on @entity110 has announced an inquiry into the issue of body image and depictions in advertising			0
@entity118 - @entity117 mp @entity116 , who has campaigned on the issue , said : ‘ @entity1 ad campaigns have a well - known , if rather far - fetched , theme of the product somehow helping young men to have more confidence with the opposite sex			0
‘ sometimes this has resulted in light - hearted and humorous adverts			2
' however in this case the @entity16 has understandably found that using such sexually provocative images , coupled with the invitation to ‘ play ’ with @entity2 , crosses the line , and is offensive to many			1
‘ these images are highly sexualised , and unsuitable for children			2
’ in its defence , @entity9 said they had no intention to cause harm or offence			1
they said the products are designed for men aged 17 - 27 and ‘ had been had been popular over the years for its playful , sexy , tongue - in - cheek take on the ' mating game ' narrative ’			0
@entity9 said consumers had ‘ come to expect , and were comfortable with , the narrative , tone and content seen in their ads ’			1
it said the video ads ‘ were designed to be playful , sexy and humorous but not to cause offence ’			2
the @entity155 fashion giant has been censured over the use of ‘ dangerous ’ images featuring @entity159 nominated child actress @entity158			2
an advertisement for the label ’s @entity162 range showed the 14 - year - old sitting alone and apparently upset and crying on a railway track			0
the @entity16 ( @entity16 ) received a complaint that it was ‘ irresponsible ’ because it was suggestive of youth suicide			1
rapped : the @entity16 concluded that the @entity155 advert featuring @entity158 ( pictured ) was irresponsible for showing a child in a hazardous or dangerous situation instant fame : the teenager received an @entity159 nomination for her role in @entity175 ( pictured ) the watchdog rejected this concern , but has ruled the image broke industry codes because it showed a child in an unsafe location			1
the teenager achieved instant fame last year after she received an @entity159 nomination for her role in a remake of the classic @entity187			0
@entity155 defended the advertisement saying it was part of a ‘ serious , high - fashion campaign aimed at adult women ’ and was placed only in adult , high - fashion magazines such as @entity194			2
it said the image was meant to portray the actress in between takes of the film , while she was waiting for the next scene to begin			0
the firm said miss @entity158 was not crying , nor had she been asked to cry or look upset			0
rather , they said the ad pictured her with a ‘ wistful and thoughtful face ’			0
@entity155 also highlighted the fact that no - one was put in any danger because the images , which were shot by top photographer and film maker @entity211 , were taken on an abandoned rail track			2
however , the @entity16 said : ‘ because the ad showed @entity158 , who was 14 years of age only when the photo was shot , in a potentially hazardous situation sitting on a railway track , we concluded the ad was irresponsible and in breach of the @entity221 in showing a child in a hazardous or dangerous situation			1
‘ the ad must not appear again in its current form			0
