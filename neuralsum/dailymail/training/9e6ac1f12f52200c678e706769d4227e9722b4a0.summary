by @entity0 and @entity1 and @entity2 more than 100 days after the @entity4 flight went missing search authorities admit they have been looking in the wrong place			2
based on new satellite projections , the @entity8 - led search operation will now focus on a 60,000 square kilometre area further south in the @entity11			1
officials also said they are confident the @entity13 , carrying 239 people , was set to autopilot several hours before its demise into desolate and unmapped waters			1
deputy prime minister @entity18 said : ' it is highly , highly likely that the aircraft was on autopilot otherwise it could not have followed the orderly path that has been identified through the satellite sightings			1
mr @entity18 added that officials were confident the plane ran out of fuel earlier than they had previously predicted			1
mr @entity18 said the new search area is based on fresh analysis of existing satellite data from the missing @entity46 flight			1
the plane vanished during a flight from @entity49 to @entity50 on march 8 with 239 passengers and crew aboard			2
mr @entity18 added that the new search phase could take more than a year			1
it will take about three months to map the ocean floor before the search can begin			1
the new analysis comes days after @entity59 police said pilot @entity60 , 53 ( pic ) , is the main suspect in the disappearance ' we could be fortunate and find it in the first hour or the first day , but it could take another 12 months , ' he said			2
the new search area , about 1800km from the @entity8 coast , has been the subject of an aerial search previously , but efforts will now head below the waves , combing the ocean floor which is some 5km deep in parts			1
underlining the scale of the task , he said the previous search area covered just 330 square miles of seabed			1
the shift was expected as the head of the @entity32 , @entity31 , said last week it would move south			0
' this site is a most likely place where the aircraft is resting , ' he said			0
' the search is going to be painstaking â€“ of course we could be fortunate and find it in the first hour or the first day , but it could 12 months			0
' mr @entity18 said @entity87 remained dedicated to the task of solving ' this greatest aviation mystery in total history			0
' two vessels , one @entity92 and one from @entity94 engineering company @entity93 are currently mapping the seafloor along the so - called seventh arc , a travel path where the plane last made contact with satellites , where depths can exceed 16,000ft ( 5,000m ) in parts			0
the next phase of the search mission is expected to start in august and cost of a $ 60 million ( $ 56 million ) or more			1
the search is already the most expensive in aviation history			0
the news that the plane was on autopilot comes just days after @entity46 pilot @entity60 , 53 , was revealed to be the prime suspect behind the plane 's disappearance			2
@entity59 police made the announcement after discovering files on @entity60 's home flight simulator showing he practiced landing on small airfields , including several in the @entity11			2
the files had been deleted from the computer before officials seized it , but have since been recovered by detectives			0
@entity4 vanished during a flight from @entity49 to @entity50 on march 8 with 239 passengers and crew aboard the criminal inquiry completed intelligence checks on all of the people on board the flight to @entity50 via @entity49 , but the only individual arousing suspicion was captain @entity60			0
the father - of - three was found to have no social or work - related future plans , unlike the rest of the crew including his co-pilot , @entity136			0
the criminal inquiry , which is yet to rule out other reasons for the plane 's disappearance including a mechanical failure and terrorism , has so far only released its results to foreign governments and their investigators .			0

@entity8 deputy *pm* says it is ' highly likely ' plane was on auto pilot
he said officials were confident plane ran out of fuel earlier than predicted
search operation will focus on a 60,000 square kilometre area further south in the @entity11 based on new satellite projections
new search phase will begin in august and could take more than a year
