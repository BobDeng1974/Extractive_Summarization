unlucky : @entity12 of @entity17 holds up @entity15 tickets , one of which had all six winning numbers for the drawing on wednesday , may 15 , 2013 , but were purchased an hour late like so many others , she decided to take a chance and play in the @entity15 lottery on wednesday when the jackpot stood at $ 360 million			1
@entity28 draw : nobody won the $ 330 million @entity15 jackpot on wednesday night the next morning , @entity12 tuned into @entity32 's @entity31 for the winning numbers and found out that her ticket matched all six			1
confusingly for her , the news was reporting that no winning ticket had been sold			2
' i called my gas station where i bought the ticket and i said , ' i do n't get it			1
i have every number and yet they say there 's no winner , ' ms. @entity12 told @entity46			1
but the store that sold her the ticket of her dreams neglected to inform her that at 8pm ( @entity50 ) on wednesday night , she was already too late to enter that evenings draw			1
the numbers had already been announced			2
