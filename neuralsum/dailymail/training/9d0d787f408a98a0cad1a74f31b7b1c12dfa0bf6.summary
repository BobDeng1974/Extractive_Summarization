it should have been a time to savour the pinnacle of her career , but instead @entity5 's glittering world has turned to dust			1
just weeks ago , the celebrity agent was lovingly thanked by @entity8 as the actress accepted an @entity10 for best actress at a glittering @entity10 ceremony			1
now @entity14 's life - as a successful businesswoman and partner to a successful actor - has come crashing down as her husband @entity18 faces years in prison as a reviled child sex offender			1
it has also been claimed that @entity14 was told about her husband 's sexual approaches to children on the set of his sitcom @entity28 ! 20 years ago			1
her refusal to believe the allegations ended one of her oldest friendships			0
@entity5 ( left ) is seen leaving a @entity35 court last month with husband and former @entity28 ! actor @entity18 , who has been found guilty of sexual assault			1
they are pictured with daughter @entity40 ( right ) when @entity8 said in her @entity10 speech last month , ' to my agent in @entity44 , @entity5 , i love you so very much , ' few if any of the @entity47 royalty in the audience would have known the significance of the statement			1
@entity8 's public thanks to ms @entity5 came in the second week of the very public trial of @entity14 's husband on 11 child sexual assault offences against young females including a cast member in his career flagship @entity44 sitcom , @entity28 ! ms @entity5 had snapped up @entity8 back in 1992 upon the promising young actor 's graduation from @entity44 's @entity62 , and has represented her ever since , also acquiring @entity8 's husband , theatre director @entity63 , as a client			1
it has now emerged that ms @entity5 's star acquisition came at around the same time when stories about @entity18 sexual advances to a child tv star were known among the @entity28 ! cast , and the show 's casting agent @entity71 claims she approached ms @entity5 to inform her			1
following a jury 's conviction last week of @entity18 on ten child sex offences , ms @entity71 , herself a victim of sexual abuse as a child , has come forward			1
actor @entity18 has been convicted on child sex charges , after he was accused by former @entity28 ! actors and and the daughters of family friends of sexual assault @entity18 in character as the father , @entity86 , in the sitcom @entity28 ! , which ran on @entity88 from 1987 until 1994 ms @entity71 told the @entity90 's @entity89 she had been close friends with both @entity5 and @entity18 for years before she learned about @entity18 ' behaviour from members of the @entity28 ! production			1
she claims she approached ms @entity5 back then and was rebuffed			2
' my whole life ’s work had been to help people find healing and help , ' ms @entity71 told the @entity89			2
' that ’s why i told his wife because i thought that ’s my duty , everybody has to know			0
she denied it and that was the end of a very long friendship , that ’s what happens people deny it			0
' @entity18 is currently in @entity44 's largest maximum security remand prison , in western @entity35 , and awaiting sentence on ten charges which include seven counts of indecently assaulting a person under the age of 16 years , and two counts of sexual intercourse with a person under the age of 16 years			1
the utter destruction of his career ends a four saga of accusations - and denials by @entity18 , who even after his conviction yelled out in court , ' i am innocent '			2
clockwise from centre front : @entity18 , @entity129 , @entity130 , @entity131 , @entity132 , and @entity133			0
ms @entity133 accused @entity18 of touching her inappropriately while on the set of the show @entity18 entered a plea of not guilty on 11 charges relating to the alleged indecent and sexual assault of five girls , which are said to have occurred between 1985 and 1990 , and his trial began on february 24			2
@entity5 supported her husband through almost six weeks of often lurid testimony at the trial			2
@entity18 , the trial heard , touched girls as young as seven , gave one victim a teddy bear and called her a ' good girl ' after forcing her to perform a sex act			1
he also exposed himself on set and indecently assaulted some of his victims			0
ms @entity5 gave evidence at the trial , saying she was shocked at the accusations against her husband , and rejected the testimony of a former woman friend of the couple the woman said when her then seven - year - old daughter told her @entity18 would molest her during sleepovers at his @entity165 house in the mid- 1980s she refused to allow her to go back			1
soon afterwards , the woman said , @entity18 ’ wife @entity5 asked her why the girl was n’t sleeping over any more			2
' i said words to the effect of ' ask your husband ' or ' keep your husband away from my kids , ' the woman told the jury			0
' she said ' we will have to get him help '			0
' challenged about these allegations in the witness box , @entity14 denied saying this and then			2
' absolutely not , ' she said repeatedly and and denied lying to save her husband			0
i ’m under oath here , she did not say those words , ” ms @entity5 told the court			0
she told the court the first allegation she was aware of - that @entity18 had exposed himself to a young girl at their home in the 1980s - was ' bad enough '			2
' i love you so very much ' : @entity8 , who was represented by @entity5 , thanked the agent in her @entity10 acceptance speech she said police investigated and took no action			1
' it 's not as if i brushed it aside ... i saw no evidence to suggest it was true , ' she said			0
@entity71 claimed on @entity199 that she had acted 20 years ago to get @entity18 sacked from @entity28 ! after informing the show 's producers about the abuse			1
' we had to get him off the show because of these allegations , ' she said			0
asked if , at the time , she believed her ' dear friend ' could have done the kind of things he was accused of , ms @entity71 said : ' yes i did believe them [ the allegations ] , and i did know 20 years ago			1
' and even then , as a survivor of child abuse myself , i was , and have been , very public about it			0
' i think at the time i did n't realise that paedophiles are your friends			0
they are lovely , fantastic people			0
they are not greasy men in dirty coats			0
' that it could be someone who i was so close and intimately involved with was terrible			0
i told his wife and it was a terrible , terrible shock to be surrounded by child abuse			0
' @entity18 will be sentenced on may 2			0
