by @entity0 last updated at 10:20 am on 24th january 2012 @entity1 has revealed that his daughter @entity2 is a budding entrepreneur who sold mince pies to his protection officers for £ 1 each			1
at the launch of a new business campaign , the prime minister told how his eldest daughter asked to make the pies on @entity10 and then flogged them to his detectives			1
' eight years old , i think it 's a good spark of enterprise , ' he told a group of entrepreneurs during a visit to @entity19			1
budding entrepreneur : @entity1 with @entity2 ( left ) and son @entity2 holds the hand mr @entity1 's anecdote came as he risked another row with @entity25 by declaring that the country 's 35 - hour working week had been bad for its economy			1
the prime minister said it was a ' mistake ' for countries to think there is a fixed number of jobs that can be ' carved up ' equally between workers			1
during visit to @entity19 , mr @entity1 said : ' i do n't think the right way to think about an economy is that there 's just a fixed number of jobs and it 's a question of how you carve them up between young people , middle aged people and older people			1
mr @entity1 once again risked the ire of @entity47 after suggesting that a 35 - hour week for @entity25 had failed ' i think that 's the sort of mistake that other countries have made , when for instance , they 've introduced a 35 - hour working week			1
' they think ' well , let 's have a 35 - hour working week for everybody and then we share out the jobs that are available , what we find happens then is that your businesses become more expensive to run than anybody else 's , you lose out to the competition and you have less jobs in the economy			1
' @entity25 president @entity47 recently objected to the prime minister lecturing @entity65 over its debt crisis			2
' we are sick of you criticising us and telling us what to do , ' he said at the time			2
' you say you hate the euro and now you want to interfere in our meetings			2
' meanwhile , mr @entity1 announced that hundreds of empty @entity73 offices will be thrown open to small firms in a bid to kick - start the economy			2
mr @entity1 wants budding entrepreneurs to be offered cheap rent deals on vacant and under - used government buildings until they have established themselves			2
the prime minister said that it was wrong for so many of the buildings to be sitting ' idle ' when they could be used by small businesses			0
there are an estimated 300 vacant government buildings across the country – some of which have been empty for more than a decade			0
while the properties lie empty , some have been costing taxpayers large sums in rent , business rates and other charges			0
the prime minister also launched a campaign aimed at encouraging people to believe ' there is a business in everyone '			0
the business in you drive will see companies hold workshops and give advice on tackling some of the issues faced by would - be bosses , with the scheme highlighted in radio , newspaper and billboard adverts throughout the year			0
mr @entity1 said : ' i said 2012 has got to be the year we go for it , the year we light new fires of ambition in our economy , the year we get behind @entity120 's grafters , doers , hard - workers and entrepreneurs			0
' this is n't something we 'd quite like to do - it 's something we 've got to do because enterprise is critical to this country 's future			0
' @entity130 is what we do in @entity120			0
this is the year that , more than ever , we 've got to go for it			0
