by @entity1 correspondent published : 04:25 est , 31 march 2013 updated : 03:40 est , 1 april 2013 lower - priced shampoo can leave hair cleaner than much more expensive products , researchers have claimed			1
@entity7 scientists studied 20 brands and top of the shampoos was @entity13 ’s @entity12 shampoo which costs just £ 3.99 for a large bottle			1
advertising : @entity16 is the face of the cosmetics giant @entity13 which came out top in tests it left locks cleaner than products which cost up to £ 100 a tub			1
the tests were carried out by @entity25 , a researcher into nanotechnology - particles so small that 300 million would fit on a pinhead			2
dr @entity25 , who is also a scientist at specialist firm @entity28 , used one of the world ’s most powerful microscopes to measure how well a selection of shampoos cleaned hair			1
by comparing unwashed and washed hair , he was able to look at how effective the various products were at removing tiny bits of dirt and grease			1
and roughness of the hair provided clues to the amount of chemical residue they left behind			1
the @entity13 product left hair the cleanest			1
dr @entity25 told the @entity48 : ‘ a clean hair under the microscope looks like a smooth surface , whereas dirty hair is covered with particles of grease or dust			0
‘ what surprised me the most was that i could n’t see any difference between what the most expensive shampoos do compared with other cheaper ones			2
’ costly : the @entity62 shampoo is £ 100 for 355ml @entity13 ’s shampoo also left the fewest residues			1
in contrast , the tests showed @entity67 , which costs up to £ 100 for a large tub , to leave behind ‘ significant residues ’			1
another luxury product , @entity71 , also left sizeable deposits			0
however , hair care companies point that that leaving residues behind is n’t necessarily a bad thing			0
for instance , they could contain conditioning or anti-dandruff treatments			0
@entity80 said : ‘ cleansing is only one element of a high - performance shampoo			0
‘ adding moisture , treating the scalp and aiding colour retention are equally important			0
’ a spokesman for @entity88 said its product deposits amino acids - building blocks of proteins - on the hair			0
@entity94 , of the trade body , the @entity96 , said : ‘ these days the difference between shampoos is less about how effective they are at cleaning the hair and more about the additional benefits , which may be conditioning , protection from heat or other damage			2
‘ measuring the roughness of hair or deposits left after cleaning is just a part of the story			2
’ the @entity112 market in hair care products is worth almost £ 1.5billion , with home hair dyes proving particularly popular in recent years			1
shampoo is , however , the most popular product , accounting for almost a quarter of the sales			0
a spokesman for market research firm @entity119 said recently : ‘ in good times as well as in bad times , consumers do not stop buying and using shampoo , but they keep an eye on promotions such as “ buy one for £ 3.50 or buy two for £ 5 ”			2
‘ @entity112 consumers are keen on these kinds of offers , and they have proven successful			0
’ renewed interest in dry shampoo has also boosted sales .			0
