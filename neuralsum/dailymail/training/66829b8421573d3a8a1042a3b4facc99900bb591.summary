climate change experts have released maps of the world revealing how prepared different countries are to cope with the effects of climate change			1
in the maps , 192 countries are ranked by their ‘ vulnerability ’ and ‘ readiness ’ , to produce an overall judgement on their fate			2
the results reveal that @entity15 countries and the @entity16 are among the most likely to survive - but areas of @entity18 will be hardest hit			1
@entity15 countries like @entity25 and @entity26 , and also the @entity16 , score highly			1
@entity27 is best , scaling down to red being worst the maps were created by @entity21 - based company @entity20 , using data from the @entity32 in @entity33 , known as the @entity34			1
they took into account location , terrain , pollution rates and national resources when calculating which countries would be most affected			0
countries like @entity25 , @entity42 , @entity26 and @entity43 score well on the scale			1
but places like @entity46 , @entity18 and @entity47 all appear at risk from natural disaster - and are poorly equipped to cope , said @entity20			1
@entity50 , of @entity20 warned : ‘ @entity51 , earthquakes , blizzards , droughts and flooding are all real dangers for some of these areas , and this is compounded by a lack of national strategy to counteract the effects			0
’ @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 and the @entity66 produced some of the lowest scores , meaning these countries will be the biggest victims of weather disasters			0
most countries across @entity73 will be not be severely affected by climate change , according to the map			1
it takes into accounts many factors such as access to clean drinking water and the risk of heat waves but places in @entity18 ( shown left ) will be most affected by a warming climate , while some countries in @entity18 like @entity86 ( right ) will also also be severely affected by global warming the map is based on data compiled by the @entity90 , which has been monitoring 45 internal and external indicators of climate change exposure of 192 countries since 1992			1
the index is built on two variables ; ‘ vulnerability ’ and ‘ readiness ’ for which a country gets a separate mark for each			2
these scores tally up to produce an overall total indicating how a particular nation would fare			0
on the scale , the country best equipped to cope with the effects of climate change was @entity25			1
in fact , @entity25 has topped the ranking every year since the @entity34 began in 1995			2
@entity111 will also apparently be able to cope with the effects of climate change , thanks to high readiness scores for the @entity115 and @entity116			2
the results have been published every year since 1995 - with @entity25 coming top every single year @entity119 has a wide range of scores for different countries , owing to the vastly different climates and levels of infrastructure in various countries			1
surprisingly , @entity127 comes out fairly well in the map , despite being a notoriously hot country various islands such as @entity131 will be severely affected by climate change , perhaps due to the effects of rising sea levels			1
others like @entity136 , though , will apparently avoid some of the worst effects ‘ adaptation challenges still exist , but @entity25 is well positioned to adapt			0
@entity25 is the 4th least vulnerable country and the 5th most ready country , ’ according to the @entity141 - @entity34 website			2
@entity142 was @entity143 , third was @entity42 , fourth was @entity26 and fifth @entity43			0
the @entity16 came in seventh , followed by the @entity115 in eighth			0
lower down , @entity146 came in 17th and @entity147 in 32nd			0
at the bottom of the table @entity64 was deemed the country that would suffer the most from climate change			2
‘ it has both a great need for investment and innovations to improve readiness and a great urgency for action , ’ said the site			0
it was followed by @entity160 , @entity63 , the @entity66 and @entity161			0
on the site , detailed factors for each country can be viewed			0
these include the projected change of cereal yields , access to reliable drinking water and vulnerability to heatwave hazards .			0

@entity21 - based company @entity20 has revealed the countries best - equipped to cope with climate change
@entity15 countries like @entity25 and @entity26 and also the @entity16 , score highly in the map
but places in @entity18 will be most affected by a warming climate
the map uses data that tracks a country *'s* vulnerability and readiness to climate change
results have been published every year since 1995 - with @entity25 coming top every single year
