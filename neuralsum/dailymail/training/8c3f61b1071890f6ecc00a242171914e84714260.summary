the timing of the president ’s trip to @entity1 's @entity10 today for a series of weekend fundraisers could not have come at a worst time because it will be during the @entity14			1
according to @entity16 , the @entity15 will put the skies over @entity1 on lock down until saturday			1
travel : the timing of the president 's trip to @entity1 's @entity10 friday for a series of weekend fundraisers could n't come at worst time because it 's the @entity14 weekend @entity24 : the @entity15 will put the skies over @entity1 on lockdown during the president 's visit this weekend corporate planes and private charters and their jet - setting passengers , will be the hardest hit			1
the no - fly zone will last from friday afternoon and all day saturday			1
but it will feel like an eternity for the high - powered @entity37 types who regularly depend on small planes to fly them to the playground of the rich and famous			1
for those people @entity0 's timing is particularly bad , says the head of one aviation firm			2
@entity46 , president of the private aviation company @entity47 said : ‘ @entity48 were very upset about it and extremely inconvenienced			0
aviation : @entity46 , president of the private aviation company @entity50 said several people were upset about being grounded by the president ' they had plans , you know , several weeks ahead of time to get out to their vacations			0
’ she told @entity16 that the company expects to lose at least $ 10,000 while @entity1 airspace is shut down			2
‘ @entity14 in particular is important because it 's at the end of the busy season of the summer , ’ @entity46 said			1
‘ so it 's really our last chance to make as much as we can as a company and keep it in reserve for the slower months that are ahead			0
’ the temporary flight restrictions over @entity1 will have minimal impact on commercial flights			0
most are already sold out , and are not an option for stranded passengers			0
however , on fridays , as many as six flights an hour take off from a pier on @entity78 's east side			2
by plane , a trip to @entity80 takes just 35 minutes while flights to @entity83 and @entity84 , where mr. @entity0 vacationed earlier this month , last about an hour			0
it could leave many wealthy people seeking alternative modes of transport			0
no fly zone : this map shows the distance from @entity78 to the @entity92 , which by plane takes just 35 minutes while flights to @entity83 and @entity84 last about an hour by car , a trip to @entity80 from @entity78 takes about two hours without traffic			1
but during one of the busiest holiday weekends in the year that could increase drastically as large numbers of @entity1 head out of town			0
meanwhile , driving to @entity83 usually takes at least six and a half hours			0
there are estimates that it could take eight or nine hours in heavy traffic over @entity14 .			2

the president is *due* to fly to @entity1 's @entity10
the timing could not be worst as it is during the @entity14 weekend
the no - fly zone will last from friday afternoon and all day saturday
but it will be an eternity for high - powered @entity37 types who want to fly
by car , a trip to the @entity92 takes two hours from @entity78
