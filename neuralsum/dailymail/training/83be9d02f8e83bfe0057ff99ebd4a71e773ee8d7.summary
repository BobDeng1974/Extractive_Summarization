the extraordinary extent of @entity2 ’s flirtation with @entity3 and the determined efforts by the post-war @entity6 establishment to bury the evidence has been uncovered in a new book by the biographer of princess @entity10			1
author @entity11 says he spent years working through @entity13 files to demonstrate @entity2 ’s true sympathy with the @entity15 - to the extent that @entity3 planned to install @entity2 as a puppet king on the @entity6 throne			1
fearing the files were ‘ an unexploded bomb ’ which could bring down the @entity25 , prominent figures including @entity20 , @entity21 and even @entity23 supreme commander @entity22 had demanded that all evidence of @entity2 ’s dealings with the @entity28 be destroyed			2
@entity2 - or the @entity31 as he became known after the abdication - thought his brother , the @entity52 , was ‘ utterly stupid , that the @entity54 was an ‘ intriguer ’ and that @entity21 was a ‘ war monger ’			1
only the continued heavy bombing of @entity6 cities , he believed , would bring the country to the negotiating table with @entity44			0
as to @entity3 himself , the duke thought he was ‘ a very great man ’ and that it would be ‘ a tragic thing for the world ’ if the @entity15 were overthrown			0
@entity11 says the crucial documents in what became known as the @entity68 were originally contained on microfilm , hidden in a battered metal canister and buried in a remote @entity44 woodland			0
they were recovered by @entity23 soldiers , dubbed ‘ the @entity76 ’ days after the end of the fighting in 1945 , and despite the best efforts of the @entity6 establishment , to suppress them , copies still survive			0
@entity11 , who also had access to previously unpublished letters and historical documents , reveals how deeply @entity2 had felt ostracised and humiliated in the wake of his abdication in 1936 , and had become dangerously outspoken in his criticism of @entity21 and the war effort			2
military leaders had serious concerns about the @entity31 , right , and his wife @entity40 , left the couple , pictured , married at a private ceremony on june 3 , 1937 in @entity92 and honeymooned in @entity44 the @entity31 , pictured here making his abdication speech , believed @entity6 could be bombed to submission before his abdication , @entity2 had gone so far as to send @entity3 a telegram wishing him ‘ happiness and welfare ’ for his 47th birthday , a month after the dictator occupied the @entity102 in march 1936			1
the duke spent his honeymoon in @entity105 before the war and visited @entity44 in october 1937 as @entity3 ’s honoured guest			2
when he accepted an invitation to take a 12 - day visit to the @entity110			0
in october 1937 , he controversially gave a @entity13 salute to @entity3 and other leaders at @entity113 , @entity15 ’s mountain retreat			1
@entity11 ’s book reports that , encouraged by @entity2 ’s unguarded private utterances , the @entity44 promised to protect his rented houses and their contents in @entity119 and @entity120 , and hatched a sinister plot to entice the @entity31 and @entity122 to stay in @entity123 while they invaded and conquered @entity6			1
the @entity31 would return home as the @entity15 ’s puppet king			1
before @entity2 ’s abdication , @entity3 had tried to marry him to a young @entity44 princess			0
when that failed , says the book , but he then flooded @entity130 with a slew of @entity13 supporting aristocrats who were ordered to find out what their @entity134 cousins were thinking			1
@entity40 , too , came under suspicion from the @entity6 authorities , says the author			0
it was thought she had conducted an affair with @entity13 diplomat @entity140 , who had sent her seventeen carnations daily , one for each night they had spent together - hence the title of the book			2
some even suspected that @entity40 was a @entity13 spy			0
despite concerns , the @entity31 made trips to the @entity147 , pictured , during the conflict by september 1939 , @entity2 and @entity40 had been packed off by the @entity6 government to @entity92			0
@entity11 writes that there is strong circumstantial evidence that loose table talk from the @entity31 made its made its way from @entity119 back to @entity154 and influenced @entity3 ’s military strategy			1
when the former king was ordered to move to @entity123 , @entity3 is said to have offered the former royals a small fortune and a palace in @entity160 , in southern @entity123 , if they would stay there for the duration of the war			1
@entity2 was so tempted by the offer he telegraphed @entity21 to ask if there was any need for a prompt return to @entity130			0
@entity21 promptly ordered that he be moved to @entity167			0
@entity11 says the @entity28 were so sympathetic to @entity2 , they regarded him as a virtual prisoner of the @entity6 secret services who longed to escape and join them			2
@entity44 diplomats believed the @entity31 was ‘ the only @entity173 with whom @entity3 would negotiate any peace terms , the logical director of @entity173 ’s destiny after the war			1
’ 17 carnations by @entity11 is published by @entity179 , priced £ 20.00			2
