the @entity4 subscriber dialled the emergency services number to lodge a complaint when she could n't find a particular film on the channel 's movie box service			1
police say this is just one example of numerous ridiculous calls made to 999 which waste operators ' time and prevent them from dealing with real emergencies			1
which emergency service do you require ? police today highlighted time - wasting calls to 999 ( stock image ) other examples include a concerned mother who called 999 because her daughter 's hamster got stuck under the floorboards , while another called because her son ’s radio - controlled helicopter had crashed on a nearby shop roof and they needed help to retrieve it			1
@entity33 say up to one - third of the 999 calls they receive should never have been made in the first place			1
superintendent @entity37 , the force ’s officer in charge of communications said : ' these might sound amusing but there is a serious point to this			0
' while we are distracted with answering these calls we are not attending to other more important calls from the public which potentially could put lives at risk and reduce the service we provide and our response to incidents			2
' ridiculous ' : in one time - wasting phone call , a woman dialled 999 because she could n't find the film see wanted to watch on @entity57 ( stock image ) ' if it is clearly not a police matter do not use us a directory inquiry or advice service			1
we will and regularly do prosecute callers who repeatedly abuse the 999 system			0
' the simple message is you should only call 999 in an emergency when a crime is in progress , a suspect is nearby or life is in danger			0
for all other matters use the non-emergency number 101			0
