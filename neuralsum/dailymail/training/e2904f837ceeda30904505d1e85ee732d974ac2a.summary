@entity0 made the extraordinary claim yesterday that @entity2 could attack @entity3			1
the prime minister said he knows communist dictator @entity5 has access to missiles that can hit the @entity3			1
the threat showed that @entity3 must keep its trident nuclear deterrent to combat ‘ nuclear blackmail ’ , he said			1
he has insisted that @entity3 must renew it nuclear deterrent defence : the @entity3 has four vanguard - class submarines each armed with @entity25 missiles @entity0 described dictator @entity5 's behaviour as ' worrying and threatening ' but his claims were immediately disputed by experts who say @entity2 does not have missiles that can reach @entity30 – and can not mount nuclear warheads on them either			1
and they sparked comparisons with the claims made by @entity34 to justify invading @entity35 ten years ago			0
mr @entity34 produced a ‘ dodgy dossier ’ on @entity38 ’s weapons of mass destruction			0
it falsely claimed that @entity35 could hit @entity3 targets with chemical weapons in just 45 minutes and was used to fuel the rush to war			1
hackers broke into @entity47 ’s social media sites yesterday and posted a picture showing leader @entity5 with a pig ’s snout			1
@entity2 uses its @entity54 website ’s @entity52 feed and @entity56 stream to send out regime propaganda , such as photos of @entity5 with military chiefs			1
but as tensions rose on the @entity62 , these halted yesterday			0
instead , one showed a picture of @entity5 ’s face with a pig - like snout and a drawing of @entity68 on his chest			1
underneath , the text read : ‘ threatening world peace with icbms and nuclear weapons / wasting money while his people starve to death			0
’ another posting said , ‘ we are @entity82 ’ – the name of a hacker activist group			0
a statement purporting to be from the hackers claimed that they had compromised 15,000 user records on @entity87 and other sites			0
the prime minister has warned that it would be ' foolish ' for @entity3 to consider abandoning @entity25 because the country faces an increased threat of nuclear attack from regimes including @entity2 prime minister @entity0 speaks with navy personnel during his visit to the @entity15 off the west coast of @entity18 on the day he insisted @entity3 must renew it @entity25 nuclear deterrent @entity0 , speaking with commander @entity19 , said he will firm up his longstanding commitment to a £ 20billion like - for - like replacement for the submarine - based @entity25 nuclear deterrent mr @entity0 spoke out after @entity2 warned the ‘ moment of explosion is near ’ and declared its military has been cleared to attack the @entity108 mainland with nuclear weapons			1
as the tense stand - off and war of words in the region intensified , the @entity108 admitted intelligence reports showed the @entity2 could be planning to launch mobile ballistic missiles in the coming days and weeks			1
@entity117 ’s foreign minister @entity116 said @entity47 ’s military had moved to its east coast a missile with ‘ considerable range ’ that could threaten @entity108 bases in the region as well as @entity124			2
@entity0 boarding a helicopter in @entity126 in 2009 and on board the @entity15 off the coast of @entity18 on a visit to @entity18 , mr @entity0 branded @entity5 ’s behaviour ‘ worrying and threatening ’ and said @entity2 has ‘ extremely dangerous technologies ’			1
he added : ‘ the fact is … @entity2 does have missile technology that is able to reach us			2
they can hit the whole of the @entity108			0
‘ if they are able to reach the whole of the @entity108 they can reach the rest of @entity30 too – they can reach us too			2
that is a real concern			0
’ maintaining the @entity3 ’s submarine - based @entity25 nuclear deterrent was a necessary ‘ insurance policy against the risks that there are in the world ’ , he said			1
but international security experts last night cast doubt on his extraordinary claim about the threat posed by @entity2			0
they said @entity47 ’s most powerful weapon – test - fired in december – has a range of 3,700 miles			2
it can reach no further than @entity157 , and certainly not the @entity3			1
the poster here reads ' safeguard to the death ' as the @entity2 army said it had approval to attack the @entity108 with its nuclear weapons @entity165 , director of nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament at the @entity169 think - tank , said : ‘ the prime minister was certainly correct as to the growing nuclear threat from @entity2 and the uncertainties of the future			1
‘ but @entity2 does not have any missile capabilities that could hit @entity3 and it is difficult to envision circumstances when @entity2 ever would want to attack the @entity3 even if they could			2
’ @entity179 mp @entity178 said : ‘ @entity2 missiles would be lucky to reach @entity117 given their previous record			2
there ’s as much truth in this claim as there was in the claim that @entity35 could hit @entity3 interests in 45 minutes			2
‘ this is clearly utter fiction and wild exaggeration			0
’ while experts do not believe @entity2 has the capacity to strike at the @entity108 mainland , @entity108 bases in @entity117 , @entity124 and the @entity194 island of @entity195 could be within range of @entity47 ’s conventional missiles			0
@entity2 hold posters of their previous leaders , @entity203 , left , @entity204 @entity205 has responded to the mounting crisis by moving mobile missile defence shields to @entity195 , while @entity209 fighters are being moved to the @entity210			0
@entity108 defence secretary @entity211 acknowledged that @entity2 is a ‘ real and clear danger ’			0
on tuesday , @entity47 announced it would restart a plutonium reactor it shut in 2007			0
a @entity108 research institute said satellite imagery shows that construction needed for the restart has begun			0
diplomats and regional analysts believe @entity5 ’s sabre - rattling rhetoric and threats to restart his nuclear programme could be part of a strategy to gain concessions from other nations and to win much - needed political credibility among his troops and people			1
however , the fear is that the young , inexperienced and potentially reckless leader is in danger of setting off a chain of events that could lead to conflict .			0
