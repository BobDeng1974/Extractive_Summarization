@entity0 , @entity1 , @entity2 and @entity3 will all have to rethink their summer recruitment plans after @entity5 confirmed that he has signed a new contract with relegation - threatened @entity7 until 2019			1
@entity5 ' new deal is understood to be worth £ 6million a year plus £ 1.5m a year in image rights - equating to around £ 145,000 a week			2
it is an extraordinary step of faith by @entity5 to commit to @entity7 , who are 16th in @entity13 , in danger of relegation and with no prospect of qualifying for the @entity19 next season , except in the highly unlikely event that they were to win the trophy this season			1
@entity7 star @entity5 has signed a new four - year contract with the club @entity5 poses with @entity7 's director of football @entity26 ( left ) and chairman @entity28 even more remarkably the deal does not contain a specific release clause - an outstanding piece of negotiation by @entity7 managing director @entity26 , given that @entity5 had a £ 20m release clause in his former contract which could be activated this summer			1
' i am happy to have extended the contract , ' @entity5 said in a club video interview			2
' when i came here ( in 2012 ) i said i wanted to do things			0
i have the feeling that it 's not over even in this situation			0
' ' we fall together and we win together , it is a decision for life			0
i did not think about it that long for no reason			0
' in a statement to the @entity49 , the club confirmed that the £ 20m release clause had been removed and that there were now no further release clauses in the deal			1
the 25 - year - old @entity7 - born midfielder , widely considered one of the best in the world , would have been available for a bargain fee , with @entity7 missing out on cashing in on one of their biggest assets had the clause remained			2
@entity5 scored in 3 - 0 victory at @entity62 which lifted @entity7 off the bottom of the table now they can expect to receive at least £ 50m for @entity5 - and the prospect of at least another season from him			1
despite a clamour of interest from the leading @entity72 clubs , with @entity2 and @entity0 leading the chase , @entity68 ' next move has always been more likely to @entity74 , with @entity75 having been the club expected to sign him this summer			0
@entity5 , however , is understood to have been keener on a move to @entity78 - but that prospect was scuppered by @entity81 's transfer ban on the @entity83 club , meaning they can not sign new players until 2016 for breaching rules in recruiting young overseas players			0
signing a new deal at @entity7 means that he is immediately elevated into the realms of one of the elite world footballers in terms of wages - and can now wait 18 months to join @entity78 , where his friend @entity94 is the reserve - team goalkeeper whatever the plans for the future , for now @entity7 are celebrating their coup in persuading @entity5 , who was a @entity7 fan as a boy , to stay			1
@entity100 wants to build new @entity7 team around @entity103 midfielder @entity5 ' we never let ourselves be influenced by all the transfer rumours and we always saw a good chance that this exceptional player could consciously decide in favour of @entity7 , ' said @entity28 , chief executive at @entity7			1
' @entity5 can become an iconic player at @entity7 , like @entity110 was at @entity111 or @entity112 at @entity113			1
' ' the fact that he is has chose to lengthen his deal here at a time of crisis on the pitch shows how strongly he identifies with the club is and we 're very proud of that			0
' @entity26 said : ' @entity5 could have chosen any top club in the world			0
the fact that he has taken this decision shown that is heart is with his home town and his home club			0
' for @entity7 , who lost centre forward @entity131 to @entity132 last summer on a free transfer after they failed to lengthen his deal and also lost @entity134 to @entity132 , who activated his £ 30m buy - out clause in 2013 , the @entity68 deal represents the highlight thus far or a dreadful season on the pitch .			2

@entity143 *international* was linked with @entity75 , @entity1 and @entity3
