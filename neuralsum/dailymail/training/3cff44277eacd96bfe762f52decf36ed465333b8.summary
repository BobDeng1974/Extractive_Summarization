by @entity0 published : 11:20 est , 15 january 2013 updated : 11:37 est , 15 january 2013 a young girl who was diagnosed with kidney cancer after she fell off her bike on holiday , has celebrated overcoming the illness by flying like @entity6			1
five year old @entity7 , was enjoying a family holiday in @entity9 in august 2011 when she took a tumble			1
she was rushed to hospital after she developed internal bleeding			0
but the accident turned out to be a blessing in disguise , when doctors treating her discovered she had a @entity20 ' tumour			1
@entity7 ( pictured before treatment left ) , underwent a year of gruelling treatment for kidney cancer			1
she enjoyed a day at the pantomime ( pictured right ) where she met the cast and had a go at flying on a wire @entity7 with @entity28			1
her father thanked all the cast at the @entity31 for making the day special her father @entity32 , 44 , from @entity33 , said : ' that accident quite probably saved her life			2
' who knows how long it would have been before we started noticing any signs she was unwell with the tumour if it was n't for that accident ? ' as soon as she arrived back in the @entity44 she started chemotherapy treatment at the @entity46 in @entity47 to shrink the tumour before having surgery to remove it , along with her right kidney			1
she then started a four week course of radiotherapy and a 36 week course of chemotherapy			2
during @entity7 's treatment she needed blood transfusions and platelet therapy			1
she struggled with numerous infections and contracted @entity58 , which resulted in her being hospitalised for a month			0
@entity7 enjoys a magical flying trip above the stage with @entity28 as @entity6 ( right ) and @entity61 as @entity62 ( left ) a form of kidney cancer that affects around 70 children in the @entity44 each year			1
it most often develops in youngsters below the age of five			0
@entity20 ' tumours , also known as nephroblastomas , begins to develop when a baby is still growing inside their mother			0
however , it may not cause any symptoms until a few years after the child is born			0
@entity20 ' tumours usually only affect one kidney ( unilateral ) but in about seven out of every 100 children it can affect both ( bilateral )			0
most @entity20 ' tumours are quite large when they are found - very often much bigger than the kidney itself			0
fortunately , most of them have not spread to other parts of the body			0
the most common symptom is a swelling in the abdomen , which is usually painless			0
occasionally , the tumour may bleed slightly and this can cause irritation in the area of the kidney , which may be painful			0
children with the condition may have blood in their urine , or their blood pressure may be raised			0
the child may also have a fever , upset stomach , weight loss or a lack of appetite			0
however , the brave girl finished treatment in september 2012 and last month her family received the fantastic news that she was in remission			1
she will continue to have regular check - ups but for now the gruelling rounds of treatment are over			1
@entity7 was able to celebrate the good news by flying like @entity6 , thanks to a wish - granting charity			2
last week she met the cast at the @entity31 in @entity116 led by actress @entity28 , before having a go on a practice swing			0
she then met @entity118 , played by @entity120 presenter @entity119 , who gave @entity7 her very own costume to fly in			2
@entity7 then took to the skies with @entity62 and @entity6 whilst the rest of the cast from the pantomime production of @entity6 filled the stage to sing			2
she rounded off her fabulous day by watching the matinee performance of the show along with her mother @entity129 , father @entity32 and seven - year - old brother @entity131			2
mr @entity132 said the cast ' were all wonderfully attentive and made @entity7 feel very special			2
thank you for giving @entity7 a memory that will shine above the memories of her long treatment			1
' @entity7 's day out was organised by the @entity138 .			1
