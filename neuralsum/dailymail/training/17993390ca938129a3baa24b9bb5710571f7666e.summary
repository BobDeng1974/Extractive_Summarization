tax cut : prince @entity1 has benefited from the new 45p tax rate for top earners , despite his income going up prince @entity1 has benefited from the new 45p tax rate for top earners – paying less to the @entity6 despite his income going up			1
last year the heir to the throne saw his ‘ pay packet ’ from the @entity9 , a private estate which provides funding for the @entity1 , rise by £ 500,000			1
but , according to accounts released yesterday , in 2013/2014 he paid £ 4.1million in tax – a fall of almost £ 250,000 on his previous bill			1
his private secretary , @entity18 , said : ‘ he has benefited from the 45 per cent tax rate			1
’ @entity1 has voluntarily paid income tax on his earnings for more than 20 years			1
last year , @entity1 ’s total income and funding , which includes money from taxpayers towards travel on official duties , went up by 7.3 per cent to £ 21,678,000			2
the prince ’s official expenditure last year was £ 12.1million			2
he also used £ 2.1million of his income from the duchy on his personal expenditure – down by £ 250,000 on the previous year – which covers everything from the cost of his food and wife @entity39 ’s dresses to supporting his two sons			1
the 50p tax rate for high earners , which is claimed to have brought unprecedented levels of tax avoidance with minimal gain , was slashed by @entity47 in his april 2012 budget and brought in last april			1
at the time it was said the cut would affect 328,000 top earners with incomes above £ 150,000 a year			1
only yesterday was it confirmed that the future king was one of them			0
a @entity57 spokesman told the @entity58 last night : ‘ the prince has voluntarily paid income tax for more than 20 years			1
he pays whatever rate the government sets			2
‘ he then chooses to spend well over half of his income after tax in support of his official and charitable work			2
’ unfortunately for @entity1 , @entity68 has vowed to re-introduce the 50p top rate if it wins the next election			0
@entity71 has repeatedly branded the decision to cut the rate from 50p to 45p as a ‘ tax cut for millionaires ’			1
while the prince has been lauded for his decision pay income tax voluntarily , questions have frequently been raised about the amount of expenditure he has been able to write - off as taxable expenses on official duties – which amounted to more than £ 10million last year			1
the prince and @entity39 conducted 665 official engagements and entertained 9,493 guests , while staff costs were £ 6.2m and £ 326,000 was spent on official entertaining and receptions yesterday ’s accounts , released , unusually , on the same day as those of the @entity89 , also revealed that @entity1 employed 127.6 ( including part - time ) staff , including 1.3 butlers and three chauffeurs as well as 2.5 valets and dressers			1
he and his family – including @entity39 , @entity18 , @entity96 and @entity97 – received 74,961 and @entity1 himself wrote 1,959 personally			0
the prince and @entity39 conducted 665 official engagements and entertained 9,493 guests			0
staff costs were £ 6.2million and £ 326,000 was spent on official entertaining and receptions			0
his utility bills dropped by £ 2,000 to £ 184,000 for the year			0
@entity1 also spent £ 140,000 on tending his gardens and staff picked more than 200 kilos of crab apples from his gardens at @entity105 to make crab - apple jelly for his shop			2
a spokesman denied suggestions that the heir to the throne in any way enjoyed a ‘ lavish lifestyle ’			2
prince @entity1 spent more than £ 1.2million on official travel last year – including £ 250,000 on hiring a private jet to attend @entity117 ’s funeral			1
the heir to the throne was by far the biggest royal user of private jets and helicopters , covering 46,000 miles on official duties over the past 12 months			2
although his total travel bill was almost double the previous year ’s figures , the rise is somewhat artificial because many of his overseas costs in 2012/13 were covered by the countries where he was travelling			1
but yesterday ’s royal accounts still laid bare some expensive journeys			0
@entity1 and @entity39 ’s official tour of @entity131 last autumn , after which they travelled to the @entity133 in @entity134 , cost £ 433,020			0
similarly a tour last year to the @entity136 , also conducted by private jet , cost £ 243,180			0
‘ these trips just could not have been carried out by scheduled flights due to the number of countries visited and the sheer schedule of the engagements that had been packed in , ’ an aide said last night			0
questions are also sure to be asked about flights taken by the @entity147 when the accounts are laid before @entity149			0
‘ @entity158 ’ managed to spend £ 14,692 on a charter aircraft to take him to @entity152 and back for official engagements which , happily for the golf fan , included a trip to @entity156 at @entity157			0
a surprising addition to the list of high spenders was the @entity89 ’s cousin , the @entity163 , who racked up £ 25,575 on scheduled flights to and from @entity165 , @entity166 , on what is described only as an ‘ @entity169 visit ’			0
overall , travel costs for the @entity171 were down by 7 per cent to £ 4.2million			0
the @entity89 is hoping to reduce costs further by leasing a helicopter for the next 12 months .			0
