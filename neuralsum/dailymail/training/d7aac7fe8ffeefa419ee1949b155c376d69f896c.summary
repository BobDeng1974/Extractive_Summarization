by @entity1 reporter published : 16:18 est , 2 november 2012 updated : 16:22 est , 2 november 2012 torn : @entity2 raped and almost strangled to death @entity4 in 1984 before murdering five women , but @entity4 wants to spare her tormentor the death penalty @entity9 has spent the last three decades struggling to move past being raped and nearly strangled to death at the hands of a man who will go on to murder five other women			1
but when @entity4 , 50 , of @entity14 , heads to the polling place next week , she will cast a vote in favor of a law that will spare the life of her tormentor , @entity2			2
@entity4 was 22 years old and living in @entity22 , @entity23 , in 1984 when she woke up on the night of march 29 to discover @entity2 standing in her room gripping a knife with a red bandana concealing his face			2
for the next five hours , then - 28 - year - old @entity2 raped and throttled her until she passed out			2
@entity4 was certain of her impending death , but she managed to outwit her assailant by pretending to like him , the @entity28 reported			0
when he finally left in the morning , the young woman even kissed him goodbye and made him promise that he will call her			0
after leaving @entity4 , @entity2 went on a murderous rampage , raping and strangling five women in a matter of 18 days			1
their bodies were later discovered in closets after he was arrested			0
@entity4 's unflinching testimony helped the prosecution win two death sentences against @entity2			2
but 28 years later , the 57 - year - old convicted killer remains on death row at @entity41 where he writes a blog called @entity43 about his daily life			1
families of the five slain women have expressed outrage that @entity2 continues to live and called on the state to help them get the closure they deserve by watching him die			2
@entity4 , however , has not joined the chorus of angry voices demanding @entity2 's execution			0
although her position has left her feeling like a traitor to the five women who died at @entity2 's hands - and whom she refers to as ' sisters ' - the 50 - year - old woman has endorsed @entity62 34 to replace death penalty with life sentence without parole in @entity66 said it has been difficult to move past her traumatic experience while she waits for the phone call telling her that @entity2 's time is up			1
fate : @entity2 is on death row at @entity41 , but could be spared the institution 's death chamber ( pictured ) if capital punishment is abolished after next week 's vote			1
file picture @entity2 's sole survivor has long opposed capital punishment , and seeing the appeals process drag on for decades with no end in sight has only reinforced her belief that it 's hard to live a full life while you await someone else to die			0
yet , the 50 - year - old woman had been unwilling in the past to go public with her opposition to the death penalty out of respect for the families of @entity2 's victims : @entity93 , 25 , @entity94 , 25 , @entity95 , 34 , @entity96 , 24 , and @entity97 , 42			1
@entity4 told the @entity28 that her reluctance stemmed in part from feelings of guilt that of all the victims , she was the only who survived - a fact that left her wondering if she could have prevented the murders , or worse still , that perhaps she was the one who had somehow triggered @entity2 â€™s murderous rampage			0
when @entity2 was arrested a month after @entity4 's rape , prosecutors decided to try him first for that crime and then call her to the stand to testify against him in the murder trials			0
when the serial killer was convicted and sentenced to death , the murdered women 's families rejoiced while @entity4 stayed silent , feeling that it was not her place to oppose the court 's decision			1
blogger : @entity2 posts articles from his cell on death row in a blog called ' @entity125 ' but when she read over the summer that @entity62 was put on the ballot in @entity23 , she wrote a note in support of the campaign to abolish the death penalty - a move that has left some of the victims ' loved ones feeling betrayed			1
- @entity4 on @entity2 in @entity4 's opinion , however , commuting @entity2 's sentence to life without parole would take away his celebrity status which he has enjoyed while on death row and help bring closure			1
those who oppose the death penalty have said that aside for the obvious argument that institutionalized killing is no better than murder , doing away with death row is also a cost - cutting measure			1
@entity23 has spent about $ 4billion since capital punishment resumed in 1977 , yet just 13 inmates have been put to death			0
an independent analysis says the state would save between $ 100 million and $ 130 million a year by converting death sentences to life - without - parole , money supporters say could be put toward public schools and local law enforcement investigations			0
proponents of the death penalty , however , argue that the purported financial benefits of replacing capital punishment with life without parole are nothing more than smoke and mirrors			2
for @entity4 , it all comes down to one simple fact			0
' i do n't want blood on my hands like he has , ' she said .			0
