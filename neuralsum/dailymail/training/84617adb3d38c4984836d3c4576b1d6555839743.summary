@entity1 is launching three new handcrafted fizzy drinks tomorrow in an effort to snag a larger slice of the carbonated drinks market ' we are changing the game in terms of how to get a carbonated drink , ' @entity30 , brand manager for @entity31 , told @entity36			0
' like what @entity1 did to coffee 40 years ago , we think we can do in the carbonation space			2
' the @entity40 sodas will be carbonated fresh , as opposed to combining syrup with carbonated water like in most commercial machines			1
instead , the flavors and spices are combined in a large cheesecloth and steeped in hot water , akin to how tea is made			1
buyers can choose from light , standard or extra carbonation			0
@entity1 went out of its way in a press release to emphasize that no high fructose corn syrup or preservatives or artificial flavors will be used			0
a 16 fluid ounce cup ( ' grande ' to a barista ) will pack 100 calories or less , it said			0
the sodas start out at about $ 2.45 for a ' tall ' , compared with $ 1.80 for the same size coffee , according to @entity36			1
the sodas will be made with a machine developed by @entity1 and partner @entity66 that unlike commercial machines does n't combine carbonated water with syrup fizzio lemon ale is a ' refreshing , citrus - forward blend of real lemon juice with hints of apricot and ginger ' the three flavors are : for those counting grams of sugar , a ' tall ' lemon ale contains 21 grams , or about five packets worth , according to the @entity80			1
a ' grande ' contains about seven packets , while the ' trenta ' equals 13 , or about 52 grams			0

@entity13 will be made the old - *fashioned* way , by combining the flavors and spices in a cheesecloth and steeping them in hot water , just like tea
a ' tall ' will set you back $ 2.45 , a bit pricier than the $ 1.80 it costs for a similar portion of coffee
the beverages will go on sale at select locations in the @entity140 on wednesday
spiced root beer : ' the *nostalgic* taste of *classic* root beer with a **delicious*ly* *unexpected* *twist* *â€“* *cinnamon* , nutmeg , clove and star anise add a flavorful kick to this soda . '
**golden** ginger ale : ' a refreshing blend of real ginger , citrus and brown sugar , the @entity154 has a unique **golden** color and a complex , *delicious* taste that *harkens* back to the *original* @entity162 introduced at the turn of the 20th century . '
and @entity166 ale : ' a refreshing , citrus - forward blend of real lemon juice with hints of apricot and ginger . '
