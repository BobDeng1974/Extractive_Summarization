mr @entity1 told delegates he wanted to inspire and alert young minds to what happened during the war because it was ' the critical moment of our times , it was the cusp of history '			1
' i think it should be , i wo n’t say obligatory , but the minister of education in me says obligatory , for every child to go there and stand there and look at those graves , but not just our graves , to go to the @entity7 graves where actually they do n’t go , ' he said			0
' because they were sons and fathers just as our boys were			0
so i think that ’s important because we are living in this world where we travel , we are @entity76 , we feel together with these people but it is important for us to know where we come from			2
' corporal @entity80 of @entity81 the @entity82 practises his bagpipes today in @entity84 during a rehearsal for a reburial ceremony in @entity87 speaking at a conference for schools on how to mark the centenary of the @entity15 , mr @entity1 ( above ) said stories are able to get through to people in a way that history books are unable to do he also said that fiction and stories can teach people about different topics			1
' of course history has to be the basis of it , that ’s absolutely the case , but it is the case also that the records that are left behind , that is the diaries , the letters home , those voices which speak from the heart , from the front to those who are loved at home , or simply jotted down , or the poems that they wrote , they have a way of getting through to us as a history book might not be able to do			2
' he added : ' what i ’ve tried to do all my writing life and all my teaching life is to bring stories to children			0
and i think the critical thing about making stories that work for children is that the children have to somehow feel the reality of the story			0
' mr @entity1 said that teachers can stand in front of pupils and tell them about a major moment in history - such as the atrocity of the @entity133			1
' it ’s all huge , it ’s all too massive to comprehend such suffering and anyway for them , it was then , so whilst they might write an essay about it and somehow you ’ve told them that story , you have n’t touched them , and you and i all know the way to touch them - they read @entity147			0
' they go there and they know it then , and they care about it because they care about one person			0

above , a wreath of poppies at a cemetery in @entity29 , @entity30 the prime minister insisted that pupils must learn why war broke out , what it was like for those involved and how the conflict helped to shape modern society			0
and he suggested that schools should not ' shy away ' from teaching pupils about the realities of the conflict			0
he said that this year ’s centenary will be a ' hugely important national moment ' which will bring people together to reflect on the sacrifices made by many men and women			2
' i want to put children at the front and centre of those commemorations , so that they too understand the significance of the conflict and the debt we owe that generation			0
' the prime minister said pupils need to learn why war broke out , and how ' political alliances and rivalries ' could have such an impact on the lives of people around the world			0
he added : ' visiting the sites where it took place is a sobering reminder of those realities			0
' seeing the thousands of names that cover the memorials , the row upon row of headstones , brings to life the scale of the sacrifice			0
' as many people as possible should visit the battlefields , which is why the government is giving two pupils and one teacher from every state secondary school the chance to go to the @entity230 , mr @entity156 said			2
@entity44 : young lack ' sense of duty ' and focus on ' personal pleasure ' people today lack the same ' sense of duty ' that drove young people to fight in the @entity15 , according to @entity44			1
modern life is all about the ' pursuit of personal pleasure ' , a concept that would have been alien to young people during the @entity15 , the broadcaster suggested			1
speaking at a conference for schools on the war , mr @entity44 said that this attitude is one of the reasons he believes such a conflict will not happen in the future			1
people today lack the same ' sense of duty ' that drove young people to fight in the @entity15 , according to @entity44 ' there was what is notably absent now - another thing that i think makes this sort of conflict unimaginable in the future - there was a sense of duty , ' he said			1
' if you consider the way we lead our lives now , we lead our lives essentially in an atomised fashion , pursing personal pleasure			0
' it ’s all about personal choice ; do what you want , please yourself			0
' this was a world that was unknown to young people in 1914 , 1915 , 1916			1
