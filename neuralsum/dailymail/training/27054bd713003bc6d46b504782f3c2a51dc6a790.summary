when @entity2 ’s next door neighbour extended his home , good relations went out of the window			1
a furious mrs @entity2 has been left with a view of a brick wall – and claims it has knocked £ 100,000 off the value of her four - bedroom home			1
a similar house sold recently for £ 475,000			2
now the 52 - year - old wants @entity12 to demolish his extension , which sits just 24 inches from her window			1
no world outside : @entity2 fears she will never be able to sell her four - bed semi-detached house after her neighbour put up a brick wall just 24 inches away from her window no light : the brick wall blocks out all natural light , plunging her newly designed kitchen and dining room into complete darkness she said : ‘ the extension wrecked not only the view , but damaged my walls and now they tell me my home has subsidence problems			1
‘ my house used to be lovely and light but now it ’s dark and dingy			2
i have to have lights on in my kitchen all the time			0
‘ he has not even finished the outside wall			0
he says he has not got the money , but he does n’t care because he does n’t have to look at it			0
it ’s made our lives a living hell			0
’ dispute : mrs @entity2 , who lives at the property in @entity49 , @entity50 with her husband @entity51 , her two sons and her mother , says the issue is a ' joke ' and claims it has n't just affected her view but also damaged her walls shadow : the extension on @entity12 's home ( circled ) was added in 2010 , four years after mrs @entity2 completed her loft conversion the bottom pictures show the original designs that were submitted to @entity64			1
the top highlights ow the roof of the extension was higher than first approved a homeowner is required to get planning permission when they build something new , make a major change to their building or change the use of their building ( by reverting it to a building premesis for example )			0
a council can take action if a developer has planning permission but is not complying with the conditions that were approved			0
they may not be following the approved plans or could have failed to submit some formation before commencing development			0
mr @entity12 submitted planning applications , which were subsequently approved , but the completed project was bigger than the original plans			1
your right to light dates back to the @entity95 , and was updated in @entity96			0
any development can potentially block the light coming into your home			2
the most common problem is where light is blocked to a side window by a high wall , that may have been built without the need for planning permission			2
however @entity64 , the local authority in control of the area , state on their website that they will not become involved in right to light disputes			0
neighbours ' rights to light apply irrespective of having obtained planning permission or building under the permitted development rules			0
the right is automatically acquired if the light has been enjoyed through defined apertures of a building - windows - uninterrupted for 20 years			2
it can also have been granted by deed			0
action : the local council has ruled the extension was bigger than @entity127 applied for - but have not ordered him to tear it down because it only constitutes ' loss of light ' building problems : mrs @entity2 claims her neighbour 's extension has not only spoiled her view but has also caused subsidence issues the saga began after mrs @entity2 – who moved into the semi-detached house in @entity49 , north - east @entity50 , with husband @entity51 , 48 , and sons @entity142 , now 22 , and @entity143 , 21 , in 1999 – redesigned her home , adding a loft and roof conversion			1
but a few years later , mr @entity12 also added an upstairs room to his home – and his relationship with mrs @entity2 hit a brick wall			1
with just two feet between his new room and her new window , all natural light through her kitchen and dining room windows is blocked , leaving her with no view apart from the brickwork			1
@entity64 has ruled mr @entity12 ’s extension is bigger than it had been in the planning application granted in 2010 , but has not ordered him to tear it down because it constitutes only ‘ loss of light ’			1
mrs @entity2 , a carer , said : ‘ it is unacceptable that the council wants to wash its hands of the situation			2
it has a responsibility to sort it out			0
’ in 2012 , she took mr @entity12 to court in a civil case over the right to light , and he agreed to an out - of - court settlement of £ 30,000			1
neighbours on the other side of mr @entity12 ’s property , @entity176 and @entity177 , have also had problems with the building work			1
in april 2011 they found a huge crack down the length of their house			0
the work cost £ 13,000 to fix , which mr @entity12 paid for			1
the council said in a statement : ‘ the council is satisfied it applied the relevant planning policies and procedures correctly			0
the “ right to light ” is a private law right which is not , of itself , a qualifying factor when determining planning applications			0
‘ it is an applicant ’s responsibility to consider the relevance of the general law , including any possible right to light and party wall issues			2
’ mr @entity12 , 45 , who lives with wife @entity212 and their four children , said : ‘ i refute all the allegations , they are all false			1
there was a garage here before so she [ mrs @entity2 ] always had a reduced light			2
she ’s accepted the compensation and we ’re now being victimised when we had permission to build the extension			0
’ the row is due to be featured in an episode of @entity220 series @entity218 next month			0
close : mr @entity12 strayed from the original plans and in december 2012 @entity2 took him to court in a civil case and he agreed to an out of court settlement of £ 30,000 workmanship : picture shows parts of the extension crumbling away			1
mrs @entity2 , who works as a carer for her mother says the building has caused ' subsidence issues ' @entity233 view : the extension at the back of the house is close to mrs @entity2 's roof conversion , which she put up before mr @entity12 built the extension			1

@entity2 , 52 , who lives with her husband , two children and her mother , fears she will never be able to sell
her neighbour @entity12 , built the wall just 24 inches from the house in @entity49 , north east @entity50
the mother - of - two redesigned her home with a *massive* loft conversion and *installed* a new kitchen
but a few years later mr @entity12 put up his own extension which blocks out all natural light
