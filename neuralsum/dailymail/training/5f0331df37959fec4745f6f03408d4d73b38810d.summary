it comes at a premium price , but it seems organic food may not be worth shelling out for			2
researchers claim it is no more nutritious than food grown using pesticides and chemicals – and wo n’t benefit your health			0
many people pay as much as a third more for organic food in the belief that it is healthier and safer			0
however , dr @entity15 and colleagues from @entity17 , @entity18 , found no clear evidence of any significant added health benefits			1
is organic food healthier for you and worth the higher price tag ? they also found that there was no guarantee organic food would be pesticide - free – a key attraction for many consumers – though it did have lower levels			1
senior author dr @entity15 said : ‘ there is n’t much difference between organic and conventional foods , if you ’re an adult and making a decision based solely on your health			1
’ the results , published in the @entity38 journal , come from the biggest review yet of existing studies comparing the two types of food			0
however , @entity44 campaigners said the survey was not equipped to detect real differences			0
researchers sifted through thousands of papers looking into the health benefits of organic food			1
the review included studies of people with organic and conventional diets , as well as research into nutrient levels , bacterial , fungal or pesticide contamination			2
even if organic is n't healthier , it is still tastier in some people 's eyes researchers found no consistent differences in the vitamin content of various foods			1
they also found no difference in protein or fat content between organic and conventional milk			2
they were also unable to identify specific fruits and vegetables for which organic appeared consistently to be the healthier choice			0
certain organic foods produce higher greenhouse gas emissions than their conventional farmed counterparts co-researcher @entity80 , who is also an instructor of medicine at @entity17 ’s @entity82 , said : ‘ some believe that organic food is always healthier and more nutritious			1
we were a little surprised that we did n’t find that			0
’ the researchers did find organic produce was 30 per cent less likely to be contaminated with pesticides than conventional fruit and vegetables , but not guaranteed to be pesticide - free , while pesticide levels of all foods came within the allowable safety limits			1
two studies of children found lower levels of pesticide residues in the urine of those on organic diets , though for all those studied the levels were below allowable safety thresholds			1
a spokesman for the @entity106 said : ‘ this @entity108 study , of limited application in @entity110 , found organic food helps people avoid pesticides in their food			2
‘ however , the scientific methodology used for the review , while suitable for comparing trials of medicines , is not right for comparing different crops			0
’ organic farming may not be better for the environment , according to @entity123 scientists			0
they found organic milk , cereals , and pork all generated higher greenhouse gas emissions than their conventionally farmed counterparts			2
organic beef and olives produced lower emissions .			0

@entity17 team find no evidence of added health benefits
also found *customers* are n't always getting pesticide free produce when they *buy* organic
