by @entity0 sledging is not exactly new and it amazes me that some people have suddenly taken exception to @entity5 saying a few words			1
where were they when @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 played ? we do n’t want our players to be robots			1
we expect a lot of them and we want to see that playing for @entity19 matters			0
international cricket is serious and i would rather see players displaying emotion than going into their shells			0
i want to see @entity5 taking wickets and going past sir @entity26 ’s record as @entity19 ’s leading wicket - taker and it could well be that the way he acts and what he says on the field is what makes him the fantastic bowler he is			1
it is very much part of his game			0
what i would say is that there is a line that can not be crossed and @entity5 does come close to crossing it at times			1
so if i were @entity19 captain i would tell him today to be careful because he will now be a marked man			0
@entity5 must avoid incidents like exchanging words with @entity37 as the players left the field on the fourth evening at the @entity63 because he is on his last chance and @entity19 must ensure that he does not risk a ban again			1
the master : @entity9 was well known for having a few words on the pitch respect : @entity70 and @entity0 shake hands the middle of a @entity42 can be a hostile , lonely place and as a batsman it is you and your mate against 11 and if you could make an opposing batsman feel less comfortable out there with a word or two then that is legitimate to me			1
believe me , there are some who would rather get back to the dressing room than fight it out and it is those a side will target , not someone like @entity89 who would be woken up and motivated when anybody said something to him			0
@entity70 would call sledging ‘ mental disintegration ’ and if @entity9 would have a word with , say , the non-striker as he walked past him that was all part of the game as far as i was concerned			1
@entity38 have had some feisty characters over the years , certainly since @entity99 ’s day , and it strikes me that @entity100 and @entity101 are two of their players who you would not target for sledging			2
they are street - fighters			0
yet @entity5 is a product of the last 20 years and he would have grown up watching the great @entity109 sides , and others , sledging and not being punished for it			2
why should he be now ? if the @entity113 want to change that and crack down on sledging then let them make it crystal clear and outline exactly what they do not approve of in their code of conduct			2
otherwise , @entity5 should carry on			2
i have said that if physical contact is involved , that is different and we will never know now what happened between @entity5 and @entity101 in the @entity126 pavilion			1
but it was always going to be one man ’s word against another , with both sides backing their man , so it should never have got to the stage where the referee was bypassed and lawyers and a judge were involved			0
the @entity113 were right to back up the verdict yesterday and now we should all move on .			0

@entity5 cleared by @entity113 for any *wrong* doing after incident with @entity101
@entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 used to sledge in their career
@entity5 must be careful or risks *facing* ban
