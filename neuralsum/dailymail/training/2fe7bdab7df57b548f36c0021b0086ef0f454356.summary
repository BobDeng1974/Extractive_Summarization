by @entity0 published : 13:02 est , 13 october 2013 updated : 11:44 est , 14 october 2013 ' for the past few centuries , we [ in the @entity6 ] have defined beauty as tall , slender figures , femininity and white skin , ' thundered model @entity9 in a recent talk for the @entity13 series of lectures			1
' this is a legacy that was built for me , and that i have been cashing in on			0
' now , just weeks after the talk , which has already received 2.3 million @entity20 views , the @entity21 , 26 , has returned to the attack in a new interview with the @entity24			1
outspoken : the model during her @entity13 talk in which she described herself as a ' pretty , skinny , white woman ' career : despite appearing on the @entity33 catwalk ( left ) , she says modelling is ' not a career path ' in it , she urges girls not to become models , describing it as ' not a career path ' and criticises the effect that the relentless bombardment of images featuring young , skinny , white girls has on other women 's self - esteem			1
she 's also at pains to point out that even when you 're as genetically blessed as she is , you do n't always feel good about yourself			2
' i have received all these benefits from a deck that is stacked in my favour , and it does n't always make me happy , ' she explains			0
' if anyone were to think that looking like a model is the key to happiness , they just need to meet a group of models			2
' because they have the thinnest thighs , and the shiniest hair , and the coolest clothes , and are probably the most insecure group of women on the planet			2
' video source ted backstage : @entity9 with @entity71 and @entity72 at a @entity74 runway show in @entity75 undue attention : @entity9 says her views get more attention than they deserve because of her career @entity9 , who has modelled for more than a decade and has worked for @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity83 as well as @entity33 , has made more than $ 3million from her work according to @entity85			2
she also admits to having gained countless advantages from her looks , despite describing herself as the beneficiary of a ' legacy of gender and racial oppression ' during her @entity13 talk			1
' it 's hard for me to see it these days , ' she explains			0
' you do n't realise you are being treated differently , and you think maybe someone is being nice and altruistic , but it happens over and over again , and then you are with someone else and you realise it does n't happen for them			0
' i have no idea what advantages i truly get , but i know people talk to me and give me time of day because they like how i look			0
' she worries too about how her @entity107 talk was received , worrying that it might perpetuate the white , skinny beauty ideal she hopes to tackle			1
' i gave the talk because i wanted to tell an honest personal narrative of what privilege means , ' she reveals			0
' i work hard but my modelling career gives my views undeserved attention			0
' but while her views have certainly been attracting attention , as far as the women who feel under constant pressure to match up to unattainable ideals and many others are concerned , undeserved it is not .			1

the 26 - year - old says models are just as insecure as other women
criticised the pressure to look good and the ' pretty , white , skinny ' ideal
