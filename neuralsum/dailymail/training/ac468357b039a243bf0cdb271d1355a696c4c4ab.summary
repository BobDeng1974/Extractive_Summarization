there is no scientific proof of man - made global warming and a hotter earth would be ‘ beneficial for humans and the majority of other species ’ , according to a founding member of environmental campaign group @entity9			1
the assertion was made by @entity12 ecologist @entity11 , a member of @entity9 from 1971 to 1986 , to u.s senators on tuesday			1
he told @entity14 : ‘ there is no scientific proof that human emissions of carbon dioxide ( @entity18 ) are the dominant cause of the minor warming of the @entity22 ’s atmosphere over the past 100 years			1
if there were such a proof it would be written down for all to see			1
no actual proof , as it is understood in science , exists			1
’ heated debate : @entity11 , pictured here giving a speech in @entity29 , has claimed that there 's no scientific evidence for man - made global warming @entity11 pointed out that there was an @entity34 450million years ago when @entity18 was 10 times higher			1
he said : ‘ there is some correlation , but little evidence , to support a direct causal relationship between co2 and global temperature through the millennia			2
the fact that we had both higher temperatures and an ice age at a time when co2 emissions were 10 times higher than they are today fundamentally contradicts the certainty that human - caused @entity18 emissions are the main cause of global warming			1
’ even if the earth does warm up , @entity11 claims that it will be to the advantage of humans and other forms of life , as ‘ humans are a tropical species ’			1
@entity11 pictured talking about nuclear power in @entity60 , @entity61 , in 2011 in mayor @entity63 's office the largest warming to date has been at the northern mid latitudes , according to the @entity67 study ' there is no scientific proof that human emissions of carbon dioxide ( @entity18 ) are the dominant cause of the minor warming of the @entity22 ’s atmosphere over the past 100 years			1
if there were such a proof it would be written down for all to see			2
no actual proof , as it is understood in science , exists			1
' the @entity80 ( @entity80 ) states : “ it is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid- 20th century			2
” ( my emphasis ) “ extremely likely ” is not a scientific term but rather a judgment , as in a court of law			0
the @entity80 defines “ extremely likely ” as a “ 95 - 100 % probability ”			0
' but upon further examination it is clear that these numbers are not the result of any mathematical calculation or statistical analysis			0
they have been “ invented ” as a construct within the @entity80 report to express “ expert judgment ” , as determined by the @entity80 contributors			0
' when modern life evolved over 500 million years ago , @entity18 was more than 10 times higher than today , yet life flourished at this time			2
then an @entity34 occurred 450 million years ago when @entity18 was 10 times higherthan today			2
' there is some correlation , but little evidence , to support a direct causal relationship between co2 and global temperature through the millennia			2
the fact that we had both higher temperatures and an ice age at a time when co2 emissions were 10 times higher than they are today fundamentally contradicts the certainty that human - caused @entity18 emissions are the main cause of global warming			1
' today , we live in an unusually cold period in the history of life on earth and there is no reason to believe that a warmer climate would be anything but beneficial for humans and the majority of other species			1
there is ample reason to believe that a sharp cooling of the climate would bring disastrous results for human civilization			0
' the @entity80 states that humans are the dominant cause of warming “ since the mid- 20th century ” , which is 1950			1
from 1910 to 1940 there was an increase in global average temperature of @entity145 over that 30 - year period			2
then there was a 30 - year “ pause ” until 1970			0
' this was followed by an increase of @entity151 during the 30 - year period from 1970 to 2000			0
since then there has been no increase , perhaps a slight decrease , in average global temperature			2
this in itself tends to negate the validity of the computer models , as co2 emissions have continued to accelerate during this time			0
' the increase in temperature between 1910 - 1940 was virtually identical to the increase between 1970 - 2000			0
yet the @entity80 does not attribute the increase from 1910 - 1940 to “ human influence			0
” ' he said : ‘ it is extremely likely that a warmer temperature than today ’s would be far better than a cooler one			0
’ humans , he added , just are n’t capable of predicting global temperature changes			1
@entity11 said that he left @entity9 because it ‘ took a sharp turn to the political left ’			1
dr @entity174 , chief scientist at @entity9 , told @entity175 : ' on climate science , @entity9 accepts the consensus view put forward by 97 per cent of climate scientists , every national and international scientific institute and every government in the world – climate change is happening , it ’s caused mainly by human activity , and it ’s highly dangerous for the future well - being of people on this planet			1
' @entity11 has made several other assertions over the years that have been at odds with @entity9 's views			1
he has advocated logging , claiming it actually causes reforestation , and attacked campaigners for fear - mongering over nuclear energy			0
his latest comments came as two of the world ’s leading scientific organisations warned that man - made global warming is worsening and will disrupt both the natural world and human society			1
the @entity204 and the @entity205 , which is the national scientific academy of the @entity206 , are releasing an unusual plain language report on climate change that addressed 20 issues in a question - and - answer format			0
‘ people do have persistent questions all about climate change , ’ said study author @entity211 of the @entity212 in @entity213			0
‘ this is a one - stop shop for many of those questions			0
’ the report , released on thursday , addresses new issues such as the recent slowing in the increase of world temperatures and how heat - trapping gases are connected to extreme weather			0
increases in extreme weather , melting glaciers , rising seas and oceans getting more acidic are already happening , the 36 - page report said			0
and those changes ‘ are expected to increase greater warming and will threaten food production , freshwater supplies , coastal infrastructure and especially the welfare of the huge population currently living in low - lying areas , ’ the report said			2
the report said that while the rate of warming is slower in the 2000s than it was in the 1990s it does n't negate the 150 years of observations that show the world is warming			1
the report also says that more the 90 percent of the heat trapped by greenhouse gases lately has been absorbed into the oceans ' deep water , which for a while slows surface warming but not the long - term trend			1
there is enough evidence on the science to warrant action , sir @entity255 , president of the @entity205 , said in a news release			0
‘ we 've changed the chemical composition of the atmosphere ; that 's not a belief system			2
we know that beyond a shadow of a doubt , ’ @entity211 said in an interview			0
‘ we ignore this at our peril			0

@entity11 has *poured* cold water on **manmade** global warming *theories*
the @entity12 said that a hotter earth would actually be better for humans
he said that there 's ' no actual proof ' of **manmade** global warming
