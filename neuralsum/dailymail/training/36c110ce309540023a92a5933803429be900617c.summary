@entity1 bomb suspect @entity0 faces charges that could lead to the death penalty			1
the @entity5 administration has a range of legal options and has indicated it intends to move quickly to build a criminal case against the 19 - year - old			1
@entity10 does n't have the death penalty , but he is expected to be charged early this week with using weapons of mass destruction to kill people , a federal crime that does carry that sentence			1
investigators plan to first question him without informing him of his legal rights to remain silent and have an attorney present			0
the @entity22 officers waiting to interrogate him are part of a unit that questioned the most high - profile terror suspects at @entity26 , according to @entity28 defence sources cited by the @entity30 newspaper			1
several @entity43 lawmakers on saturday criticised the administration 's approach because they said it would afford @entity0 more rights than he deserves			1
the federal public defender for @entity10 called for the quick appointment of a lawyer to represent @entity0 because of serious issues involving his interrogation in the absence of a lawyer			1
prosecution of @entity0 in federal court would seem a natural course for an administration that previously won a life sentence against @entity60 of @entity61 for trying to blow up a packed jetliner using a bomb sewn into his underwear on christmas day 2009			1
death penalty ? the @entity5 administration has a range of legal options in the @entity70 bombings , and they could include seeking the death penalty against the 19 - year - old suspect in the case instead of reading tsarnaev his @entity77 rights , prosecutors planned to invoke a public safety exception created by the need to protect police and the public from immediate danger the administration also will put @entity85 's son - in - law on trial in january on charges that he conspired to kill @entity28 in his role as @entity90 's chief spokesman			1
as a @entity28 citizen , @entity0 could not be tried by a military commission under current law ; the only option for prosecuting an @entity28 is in civilian courts			1
a federal official with knowledge of the case said @entity0 was naturalized as a @entity28 citizen in september 2012			2
the official was not authorized to speak publicly about details of the case and requested anonymity			0
@entity0 was under armed guard at a @entity1 hospital and was reported in serious condition and unable to be interrogated saturday			1
he has yet to be charged but prosecutors appear to have no shortage of federal laws at their disposal			2
the most serious charge would be the use of a weapon of mass destruction to kill people , which carries a possible death sentence			1
three people died in the twin explosions in @entity1 and more than 180 were injured			0
@entity10 does not have the death penalty , and it remains to be seen whether the administration would try to persuade a jury to sentence @entity0 to death			2
outspoken : sens. @entity125 , @entity126 , and @entity127 , @entity129 - @entity128 , are part of a group of four lawmakers demanding not to read the teenager his @entity77 rights the state could try to bring charges against him , including for the death of @entity139 , the @entity140 police officer who authorities say was killed by @entity0 and his brother , @entity144			1
an early question that arose after @entity0 's capture on friday was how to conduct his initial interrogation			2
the administration said it would not immediately inform him of legal protections known as the miranda rights			0
instead , prosecutors planned to invoke a public safety exception created by the need to protect police and the public from immediate danger			0
the @entity158 's executive director , @entity157 , said the exception applies only when there 's a continued threat to public safety , like whether there is imminent danger from other bombs , and is ‘ not an open - ended exception ’ to the @entity77 rule			2
the federal public defender for @entity10 , @entity169 , said her office expects to represent @entity0 after he is charged and that he needs a lawyer appointed as soon as possible because there are ‘ serious issues regarding possible interrogation			1
’ but several congressional republicans said @entity0 's rights should be even more restricted than the administration intends			2
‘ i am disappointed that it appears this administration is once again relying on @entity77 's public safety exception to gather intelligence which only allows at best a 48 - hour waiting period that may expire since the suspect has been critically wounded , ’ senator @entity178 of @entity179 , the top @entity43 on the @entity180 , said in a statement hours after @entity0 was captured			1
joint statement : sen. @entity188 of @entity189 , left , as well as rep. @entity190 , @entity191 , right , both signed the statement saying there were valuable things that the suspect could reveal @entity178 ' concerns were echoed by senators @entity125 , @entity198 , @entity188 , @entity199 , and @entity127 , @entity200 , as well as representative @entity190 , @entity201 ‘ a decision to not read miranda rights to the suspect was sound and in our national security interests , ’ the four said in a statement			0
‘ however , we have concerns that limiting this investigation to 48 hours and exclusively relying on the public safety exception to @entity77 , could very well be a national security mistake			0
it could severely limit our ability to gather critical information about future attacks from this suspect			0
’ but representative @entity215 , @entity216 , a former federal prosecutor and member of the @entity218 , said the administration should ignore ‘ hasty calls to treat the suspect as an enemy combatant			0
’ ‘ this is not a foreign national caught on an enemy battlefield , but an @entity28 citizen arrested on @entity28 soil , ’ @entity215 said			0
‘ the @entity227 has demonstrated a far greater ability to successfully prosecute suspected terrorists in federal courts than the military commissions have thus far been able to show			0
nothing must be done to compromise the public safety , the ability of prosecutors to seek justice for the victims or our constitutional principles			0
’ while the @entity43 asserted that @entity0 can be held as an enemy combatant , the @entity240 has never resolved whether citizens or foreign nationals arrested on @entity28 soil can be held by the military , as opposed to civilian authorities			2
the court twice was prepared to take up that question in recent years , once while @entity249 was president and once since @entity5 became took office			0
both times , the administration moved the suspected terrorists , @entity28 citizen @entity254 and graduate student @entity255 , from a military brig to civilian confinement to head off the high court case			0
open investigation : law enforcement evidence technicians continue to investigate the scene of the @entity70 bombings on saturday			0
