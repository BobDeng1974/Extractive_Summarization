by @entity0 published : 19:21 est , 9 february 2013 updated : 07:51 est , 10 february 2013 food minister @entity1 yesterday declined @entity3 ’s offer of a tasty @entity5 spaghetti bolognese lunch , saying he would n’t be ‘ revisiting ’ @entity7 ’s infamous photo call with a beefburger			1
mr @entity1 insisted ready meals were safe following the withdrawal of @entity5 beef lasagne meals , which have been found to contain up to 100 per cent horsemeat			1
but he said it would be ‘ bad politics ’ to follow former @entity16 agriculture minister mr @entity7 ’s attempt to win public trust at the height of the 1990 mad cow crisis			1
mr @entity7 was photographed eating a burger and feeding some to his four - year - old daughter @entity21			1
in case he did n’t fancy @entity36 , we had a @entity5 cottage pie and @entity39 on stand - by to pop into the hall ’s microwave			1
the smiling @entity42 inspected our lunch offer and replied : ‘ how kind			2
’ but , betraying a certain lack of trust , he asked : ‘ is this the one that ’s been withdrawn ? ’ when we assured him it was spaghetti bolognese , purchased only two hours previously , mr @entity1 replied : ‘ listen , my concern is that we went through this with @entity7 and i think that was bad politics because it ’s not a question of what i think – it ’s what the public are happy with			1
@entity61 meal : @entity5 beef lasagne has been withdrawn but mr @entity1 would not eat another beef dish from the company ‘ i do n’t have a problem with the meal – the advice i get is that this food is safe			1
but put it all over the papers and it ’s “ minister re-visiting @entity7 ”			1
‘ i ’m not dodging it			2
i just think that was really , really bad politics at the time because people have got to take their own decisions			2
‘ we ’ve got to give them the facts based on all the evidence that we have			2
let ’s get that evidence			2
’ he added : ‘ what we ’re doing at the moment is reading the riot act to manufacturers and processors and saying , “ look , you ’ve got to test everything and give us an assurance			0
” ‘ it ’s the biggest test we ’ve ever had on beef products across the country			0
what we ’re uncovering now more and more are these instances in many other @entity96 countries and i think it points very heavily to real , big - time criminals			0
infamous photo call : mr @entity1 said he would n't be ' revisiting ' the @entity7 saga who was photographed eating a burger and feeding some to his daughter @entity21 , 4 , in an attempt to win public trust at the height of the 1990 @entity108 crisis pointing at our meals , he said : ‘ it ’s safe			1
that ’s the advice from the @entity112			0
but whether everything is as it ’s labelled is the big question			0
when we ’ve got the results that tell us we can be 99.9 per cent certain everything is as labelled , we can tell people			0
at the moment we ca n’t			0
we want this information by the end of the week			0
’ after his 30 - minute surgery , mr @entity1 said he had no idea what he would be having for sunday lunch at home			1
‘ i probably wo n’t be there because like everyone else in the department , l ’m flying all over the place trying to deal with this			0
’ with that , he jumped into his @entity133 and was gone .			0

@entity1 did not want to ' revisit ' @entity7 *'s* infamous photo
