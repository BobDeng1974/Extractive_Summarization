the number of children who have died from asthma attacks in the past two years has sky - rocketed , new figures have revealed			1
the latest @entity7 child death review found that in the last 10 years , 20 children have died from the respiratory disease but the alarming figure is that half of those deaths occurred in the past two years			1
it was also found , there were more deaths in 2010 , 2012 and 2013 than in previous years and more than two thirds of those children were male , twice the rate of girls for the same period			0
in most cases , it 's been put down to complacency , the children who died from asthma had factors that may have increased their risk of death			1
surprising figures in the past two years have seen the number of children dying from asthma attacks has increased in @entity7 the report states the majority of the children had more than one risk factor , while insufficient follow up after a hospital admission was a factor for eight children who did not visit a doctor			1
for four children , it was unclear who in the family was overseeing the child ’s asthma management			0
while in relation to the fatal asthma attack , in six cases there were indicators that the child or the child ’s family may not have recognised early signs that asthma symptoms were slowly worsening , or may not have fully appreciated the severity of the child ’s condition			0
@entity70 ceo @entity69 says the figures are surprising since there has been a downward trend in childhood related deaths in the last decade			1
' they show asthma is not being taken seriously , some deaths could have been prevented , ' she said			0
' the foundation strongly advises people to take asthma more seriously , making sure children have an asthma action plan in place and preventative measures are taken regularly ( because some people get caught out )			0
' ' when the child does start to expose symptoms , something must be done within minutes			0
' the increase in child deaths from asthma has been put down to complacency , including sub-optimal level of asthma control , insufficient follow up after a hospital visit and lack of action plans ms @entity69 says there is still a lack of understanding because asthma is a complex disease which impact people differently			1
' to find the right medication , to find the right dose is not the simplest thing in the world but education is key , ' she said			0
the @entity70 regularly conducts survey in a bid to get a reading of how well asthma is controlled and other key issues			0
' most people thought it was well controlled but three quarters of cases are not well controlled according to our asthma test			0
' @entity121 has the highest incidence of asthma in the world , with every one in ten @entity121 suffering from the disease			2
but over the last decade there has been a significant decrease in deaths			1
' there was 1000 deaths in the late 1980s and recently there 's been around 400 deaths , ' said ms @entity69			2
@entity134 ceo @entity69 says there is still a lack of understanding because asthma is a complex disease which impact people differently @entity121 has the highest incidence of asthma in the world , with every one in ten @entity121 suffering from the disease ' there 's still more work to be done			1
' the @entity70 has encouraged people on its website to take the asthma control test , a way to work out your level of asthma control			2
it asks five questions , including , how often you 've had shortness of breath , and the asthma score will assist health care professionals in helping sufferers to reach the best asthma control possible .			2
