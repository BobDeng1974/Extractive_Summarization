would n't it be great if you had a way of making your wildest wishes come true ? now one ' virtual genie ' company is granting hundreds of wishes to users through crowdsourcing technology			1
but there 's nothing virtual about the wishes			2
@entity13 offers users the chance to ask for anything they want , be it products , experiences , charity or causes , with the most popular wish being granted each day			1
ultimately the @entity23 team want the wishes and the people power behind them to be used to create a force for good , but that does n't stop one asking for a trip to @entity29			1
so far the start - up has made donations to charities such as the @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 and the @entity37 foundation , surprised @entity39 staff with gifts , lobbied ceos for equal pay , and negotiated high street discounts			1
make a wish : a new start - up called @entity46 has launched where users can make any wish they want - and the most popular one will be resolved established by 43 - year - old entrepreneur @entity51 , the site encourages users to ' like ' other people 's wishes through the webpage or via social media			1
@entity37 told @entity57 : ' i kept seeing evidence for groups of people coming together online to create outcomes for themselves that they would n’t have been able to achieve on their own … from @entity64 to the use of social media during the @entity67			0
' i know this sounds completely ridiculous , but i wanted to create a site where people could come and ask for literally anything and get a meaningful and freshly generated response			1
that was the brief and it took me a while to figure on how it was going to work , a bit longer to design , then about six months to build			0
' after six months of building , the former marketing director of @entity79 unveiled a simple website where users can ask for up to ten wishes for anything ranging from products , experiences , or causes			2
people who have made wishes can ask people to support them via @entity91 and @entity92 and the more people that ‘ me - too ’ them , the more chance they have of being granted			1
brains behind the operation : @entity51 , former marketing director of @entity79 , wants to use the critical mass of the users to help bring their dreams closer to reality ' whatever you ’re hoping for , someone else - somewhere - is going to be wanting the same thing ; the majority of our wishes are likely to be shared by other people			1
' the greater the number of people who want something , the more likely that thing is to be delivered , ' reads the site , which is soon to have an accompanying app. ' so @entity46 exists to link together people ’s hopes , dreams , ambitions and desires			1
it ’s designed to bring people together to create outcomes that are more likely to happen if lots of people are asking for those outcomes , rather than a single individual			0
' every 24 hours the most popular wish on the site is taken on by our team of expert deal brokers , researchers and negotiators who then use the power of the combined demand to create results on behalf of that newly formed community , ' said @entity37			1
that is n’t to say that wishes will be miraculously granted ; more that the site will work tirelessly to make this aggregated demand as influential as it can be			1
this might involve creating discounts on popular products that have been selected , it might involve lobbying people who can help change something unfair , or it might be about creating unique experiences available nowhere else			2
' i think people like it as a notion ; wishes have got a childhood iconography that is appealing at quite a deep level , plus they seem to respond well to the way in which the wishes get actioned - which is sometimes quite earnest and serious , then on other occasions is much more light - hearted and irreverent , ' said @entity37			2
the simple things : the crowning wish of the day was for free coffee so @entity37 and his team granted it consider it done ! one user wished that people who worked for the @entity39 got the respect they deserve			0
the team visited a variety of hospitals to take staff some presents if the most popular wish of the day is for a physical product - a camera for example – @entity46 will use that aggregated demand to create a discount on the users ' behalf			1
if it is a service needed , they will link wishers to the best supplier , using a trust rating , at the most competitive price			0
maybe it is a cause you feel strongly about , then the site will lobby those who could help directly , organise a meet - up or create a disruptive action to help			0
if it is advice that people need , @entity46 promise to commission an expert or collate the collective experience or wisdom of those who had dealt with similar circumstances or situations			1
perhaps an experience will be the most popular wish of the day , then they would create a bespoke one for that community as a unique one - off at the best possible price or perhaps for free			2
all in a day 's work : recently the @entity23 team paid for an elderly couple 's shopping for them after ' i wish i could help a stranger ' was voted the top wish has @entity37 ever wanted to resolve a wish he could n't ? ' no , ' he says plainly			0
' and we never will because we just stick to achievable actions			0
' we do n’t claim to magically fulfill wishes like some @entity220 fairy - godmother and we stick really clear of those kind of cheesy " then @entity223 jumped out of the cake and everyone started crying " style resolutions			0
we just do something positive each day in line with what people want ; we are not claiming any magic powers or miraculous abilities ; we just do things that are useful , helpful or funny			0
while he promises he will never carry advertising on the site , he imagines three distinct revenue streams : charging brands to be involved with the fulfillment of wishes as a pr / activation exercise , a constant offering in the style of @entity243 ; now the fastest growing media site of all time , and a premium offering where wishes get actioned more rapidly , almost like a concierge vibe			2
so where does @entity37 see @entity46 in three years time ? ' you ’re meant to have an insanely ambitious goal , right ? , ' he said			2
' well , here ’s mine ; to join together the world 's hopes and ambitions , collate and quantify them , then use their critical mass to help bring those dreams closer to reality			0
i hope three years from now we ’ve made significant progress towards that objective			0
' read all about it : users can easily track exactly which wishes have already been granted each day and read the personal stories that accompany them and the top three , according to @entity270 ... people voted for a gagging order on @entity273			1
we managed to dupe her into signing one by posing as obsessive fans ( like she has those )			0
one woman was in a truly desperate situation where she had had to flea a horrendously abusive situation and was living in a half way house with no furniture or toys for her child , whose birthday was the coming weekend			0
we sorted out things for her that made her cry with happiness .			0

@entity46 lets people make up to 10 wishes for anything they want
users encouraged to ' like ' their favourite wishes
most popular ones are resolved every 24 hours
site has made donations to charities , lobbied @entity304 and *retailers*
