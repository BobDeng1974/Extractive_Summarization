female genital mutilation is the practice in which some or all of the female genitals are removed , typically with a blade or a razor and sometimes without anaesthesia			0
this includes removing the clitoral and the fold of skin above it , and removing labia – the inner ' lips ' of the vagina			0
in the most severe form , the inner and outer labia are removed and the opening of the vagina is closed with a small hole so the woman can pass urine and menstrual blood			0
sometimes the vagina is then cut open for sex or childbirth			0
women sometimes bleed to death or can be left with horrifying health effects , such as infections , chronic pain , cysts , infertility and problems giving birth			2

' the practice violates a person 's rights to health , security and physical integrity , the right to be free from torture and cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment , and the right to life when the procedure results in death			0
' it is estimated that between 100 and 140 million girls and women around the world have undergone genital mutilation			2
each year around three million women are thought to be at risk			0
@entity15 ranges from the partial or total removal of the clitoris , to the removal of the entire clitoris and the cutting of the labia minora			2
in it 's most extreme form , all external genitalia is removed and the two sides of a woman or girl 's vulva are stitched together			0
