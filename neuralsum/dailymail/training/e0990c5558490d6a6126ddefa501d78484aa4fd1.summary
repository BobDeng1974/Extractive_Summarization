the @entity0 is recommending an end to the nation 's lifetime ban on blood donations from gay and bisexual men , a 31 - year - old policy that many medical groups and gay activists say is no longer justified			1
the @entity11 administration 's @entity0 said tuesday that it favors replacing the blanket ban with a new policy barring donations from men who have had man - on - man sex in the previous 12 months			2
the new policy would put the @entity18 in line with other countries including @entity21 , @entity22 and the @entity23 democrats in @entity25 quickly complained that the move did n't go far enough			1
senator @entity27 of the state of @entity29 , who will be @entity24 / ranking member of the @entity30 in january , called it ' a welcome step in the right direction			0
' activists , however , questioned whether requiring a year of celibacy from gay men before a donation amounted to a significant policy shift			1

the @entity0 said on december 23 that it will move to ease a lifetime ban on blood donations from homosexual men , allowing them to give but only after a year of abstaining from sexual activity ' @entity51 lifetime ban ' : gay males will be able to give blood in the @entity18 , but only if they have n't actually had sex with a man in 12 months ' this new policy can not be justified in light of current scientific research and updated blood screening technology , ' said @entity60 of the @entity61 , the largest @entity18 gay rights group			1
other activists said the new proposal would continue to stigmatize gay and bisexual men			0
' this new policy does not require heterosexual blood donors to be celibate for one year			2
some may believe this is a step forward , but in reality , requiring celibacy for a year is a de facto lifetime ban , ' @entity66 , a @entity67 - based nonprofit that supports @entity69 prevention and care , said after the announcement			1
@entity76 said she was ' disappointed that low - risk gay men are still being discriminated against with this outdated policy			2
' ' @entity81 who do n’t engage in risky behavior , regardless of their sexual orientation , should have the opportunity to donate blood and help in the effort to save lives , ' she said			0
fellow @entity24 sen. @entity88 of @entity89 agreed			0
' the @entity0 must continue to work towards implementing blood donation policies based on individual risk factors , ' @entity88 said in a statement , instead of singling out one group of people and turning away healthy , willing donors , even when we face serious blood shortages			0
' the lifetime ban dates from the early years of the @entity69 crisis and was intended to protect the blood supply from what was a then little - understood disease			1
but many medical groups , including the @entity103 , say the policy is no longer supported by science , given advances in hiv testing			0
gay activists say the ban is discriminatory and perpetuates negative stereotypes			0
the agency will recommend the switch in draft guidelines early next year and move to finalize them after taking comments from the public , @entity0 officials told reporters			0
@entity0 deputy director dr. @entity118 declined to give a timeframe for completing the process but said , ' we commit to working as quickly as possible on this issue			0
' @entity118 said some of the most compelling evidence for changing the policy comes from @entity21 , which put in place a one - year ban on donations over a decade ago			1
recently published studies showed no change in the safety of the blood supply after making the switch			1
additionally , studies conducted by the @entity18 government suggest gay and bisexual men are actually more likely to abide by donation guidelines under a 12 - month prohibition period			2
all blood donors take a questionnaire about their health and sexual behavior , but some gay men reportedly answer inaccurately to donate blood			0
the @entity0 made the announcement on tuesday , bring muted applause from gay rights groups and congressional @entity24 who want the agency to go further all @entity18 blood donations are screened for hiv but the test only detects the virus after it 's been in the bloodstream about 10 days			1
still , @entity0 officials said current research does not support reducing the donation ban below one year			0
according to government figures , men who have had sex with other men represent about 2 percent of the @entity18 population , yet account for at least 62 percent of all new hiv infections in the @entity18 the @entity0 's announcement follows years of government discussions re-examining the ban			1
last month a panel of blood safety experts convened by the @entity168 voted 16 - 2 in favor of doing away with the total ban			2
the panel recommended moving to the one - year ban that was formally proposed tuesday			0
the @entity0 implemented the lifetime ban in 1983 , when health officials were first recognizing the risk of contracting @entity69 via blood transfusions			1
under the policy , blood donations are barred from any man who has had sex with another man at any time since 1977 – the start of the @entity69 epidemic in the @entity18 the push for a new policy gained momentum in 2006 , when the @entity41 , the @entity187 , and @entity188 called the ban ' medically and scientifically unwarranted			1
' last year the @entity103 voted to oppose the policy			0
patient groups that rely on a safe blood supply , including the @entity193 , have also voiced support for dropping the ban .			2

gay males have been prohibited from giving blood in the @entity18 since 1983
*originally* the ban was meant to protect the blood supply from hiv / aids
@entity21 changed its policy in the same way 10 years ago and has n't seen a decline in the safety of its donor blood
