spherical fossils in @entity1 dating back 600 million years could be the remains of the planet 's earliest animals			1
the fossils are 60 million years older than the date skeletal animals appeared during a huge growth spurt of new life on @entity9 known as the @entity10			1
@entity12 scientists claim the fossils are too complex to be bacteria , and may instead be the embryos of an ancient unidentified creatures			0
spherical fossils in @entity1 dating back 600 million years could be the remains of the planet 's earliest @entity19 fossils are 60 million years older than the date skeletal animals appeared during a huge growth spurt of new life on @entity9 known as the @entity10 called @entity24 , the ancient fossils come from a rock layer in southern @entity1 called the @entity26 and contradict several longstanding interpretations of multicellular fossils			1
each fossil measures around 0.03 inches ( 0.7mm ) across and originated from what could have been a marine environment at the time			0
' this opens up a new door for us to shine some light on the timing and evolutionary steps that were taken by multicellular organisms that would eventually go on to dominate the @entity9 in a very visible way , ' said @entity41 , a professor of geobiology in the @entity43			0
called @entity44 , the ancient fossils come from a rock layer in southern @entity1 called the @entity26 and contradict several longstanding interpretations of multicellular fossils the @entity49 explosion , or @entity49 radiation , was the relatively rapid appearance , around 540 million years ago , of most major animal phyla , as demonstrated in the fossil record			1
about 580 million years ago , most organisms were simple , composed of individual cells occasionally organized into colonies			2
over the following 70 or 80 million years , the rate of evolution accelerated by an order of magnitude ( as defined in terms of the extinction and origination rate of species ) and the diversity of life began to resemble that of today			2
it ended with the cambrian - ordovician extinction event , approximately 488 million years ago			2
' fossils similar to these have been interpreted as bacteria , single - cell eukaryotes , algae , and transitional forms related to modern animals such as sponges , sea anemones , or bilaterally symmetrical animals			1
this paper lets us put aside some of those interpretations			0
' by cutting the rocks into extremely thin slicers , the scientists were able to shine a light through the fossils to see the formation inside , according to a report in @entity88			0
professor @entity41 found patterns in the fossils that suggests cell - to - cell adhesion and programmed cell death - qualities found in the cell of animals and plants			1
the fossils could represent the shift between single - celled life and multicellular animals , professor @entity41 said			1
professor @entity41 is now hoping to find more @entity44 , including fossils of the adult creatures that may have created the embryos			0
' we will have to be open - minded in terms of what can be expected , ' professor @entity41 told @entity106 at @entity88			0
' there are extinct animals or even offshoots of the lineages leading to animals that could be rather different from what we know as animals living today			0

called @entity24 , the fossils were found in rock in southern @entity1
they are 60 million years older than date skeletal animals appeared
but the cells are too complex to be belong to bacteria , the study claims
they may represent shift between single - cell life and multicellular animals
