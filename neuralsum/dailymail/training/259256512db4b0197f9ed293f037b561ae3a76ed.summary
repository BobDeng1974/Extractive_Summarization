published : 06:09 est , 16 november 2012 updated : 07:11 est , 16 november 2012 researcher have identified the furthest ever galaxy discovered in space - a staggering 13.3 billion light - years from @entity2			1
the galaxy was observed around 420 million years after the @entity4 when the universe was just 3 per cent of its current age			1
astronomers have calculated the galaxy is a 13.3 billion light - years from @entity2 with a single light - year representing 5,878,625 million miles			1
the object was observed 420 million years after the big bang the object is so small it may be in the first stages of galaxy formation , with analysis showing the galaxy is less than 600 light - years across			1
for comparison the @entity16 is 150 000 light - years across			2
the estimated mass of this baby galaxy is roughly equal to 100 million or a billion suns , or 0.1 - 1 percent the mass of our @entity16 ’s stars			2
it was spotted using @entity34 ’s @entity33 , @entity35 , and one of nature ’s own natural ' zoom lenses ' in space			1
scientists say the object is in the first stages of galaxy formation with analysis showing it is less than 600 light - years across			2
our galaxy , the @entity16 , is 150,000 light - years across with the @entity47 a third of the age of the newly discovered galaxy			0
@entity51 , from the @entity50 , said			0
' this object may be one of many building blocks of a galaxy			0
' over the next 13 billion years , it may have dozens , hundreds , or even thousands of merging events with other galaxies and galaxy fragments			0
' @entity61 , where the latest galaxy was spotted @entity51 and his collaborators spent months ruling out alternative explanations for the object ’s identity - such as red stars , brown dwarfs , and red galaxies - to conclude it was a very distant galaxy			0
the object , named @entity13 , is the latest discovery from a programme which uses natural zoom lenses to reveal distant galaxies in the early universe			1
the @entity77 survey with @entity33 ( @entity78 ) is using massive galaxy clusters as cosmic telescopes to magnify distant galaxies behind them , an effect called gravitational lensing			2
@entity86 , from @entity87 , @entity88 , said : ' while one occasionally expects to find an extremely distant galaxy using the tremendous power of gravitational lensing , this latest discovery has outstripped even my expectations of what would be possible with the clash program			0
“ the science output in this regard has been incredible			0

@entity99 was observed 420 million years after the @entity4
found by @entity34 ’s @entity33 , @entity35 , and one of nature ’s own natural ' zoom lenses ' in space .
