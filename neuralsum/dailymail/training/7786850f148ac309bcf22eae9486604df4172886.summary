as @entity1 's first female prime minister @entity0 was not only pioneering in politics but also in fashion , setting an example of how she believed women in power should dress			1
during her time as @entity7 in the @entity8 , she became famous for her power dressing suits , pussybow blouses and , of course , her treasured pearls			2
@entity13 , who died today aged 87 , summed up her style as ' never flashy , just appropriate			1
' signature style : @entity0 became known for her smart suits , practical heels and pearls the former @entity20 leader spoke of her fashion choices in an interview with dr @entity23 for @entity24 in 1985 , saying she did have to be conscious of her image but she was more concerned with feeling comfortable than stylish			1
she said : ' what you do is decide the clothes in which you are comfortable			1
you are going to a great occasion			2
it must be a style that you are comfortable in			1
must be a fabric that you are comfortable in , that hangs well , and you must know that you look appropriate for the occasion			1
never flashy , just appropriate			2
' she continued : ' it is not unfeminine to be well - tailored			1
indeed , it often perhaps concentrates on what you are going to say if you have got well - tailored things on because people no longer look at your clothes			1
' feminine touch : she said she often wore pussybow blouses because they were ' rather softening and pretty ' substance over style : the @entity47 said she always aimed to dress appropriately @entity0 admitted that what she wore ' became part of the job ' because she was ' representing the country '			1
she admitted to dr @entity23 that she did n't always get it right			2
she regretted wearing a blue and white striped hat in the @entity55 when she was the education secretary because she realised it was n't fitting for her role			2
' it was a very smart hat			0
the fact was it would have done for an actress , but it was not quite right for a politician			0
i learned that lesson ever since			0
if you are going to wear a smart hat , wear a very plain one , ' she said			0
the @entity70 ' signature style was one that she honed during her time as @entity7			0
growing up as the daughter of a grocer , she was used to being on her feet and helping in the shop			0
hats off : she was a fan of hats in the @entity79 but lived to regret some of her choices and did n't wear them as often during her time as prime minister grocer 's daughter : in her youth , the @entity47 , pictured , left , wore frumpier clothes this helped her become aware of the practicalities of fashion - comfortable shoes like her low heels were always preferable over high heels , no matter how stylish			1
her mother and father were also frugal which taught her to buy clothes and accessories that lasted - like her black @entity98 handbag that would last for decades			1
it still looked as good as new when it sold at auction at @entity101 for Â£ 25,000 in 2011			0
@entity102 researched @entity0 's fashion when writing the script for the film @entity13			1
the film depicts how the @entity47 was advised on how to make her image less frumpy on her bid to win power including giving up wearing hats and pearls			1
she refused on the latter because they were of sentimental value - given to her by her husband @entity113 when their twins were born			2
true blue : the former @entity20 leader said her party 's colour was always her favourite shade firm favourite : she 's continued to wear the colour often for public appearances , such as when she returned to @entity125 when @entity126 came to power @entity102 said when the film was released : ' the star - makers may have told her what to wear but she already knew how to dress - she was of that generation of women trained to appear in a certain way , hair set , with a proper hat , gloves , bag and shoes			2
the grooming was very regal , and her uniform had a regality about it			0
' @entity102 's belief that the former @entity144 ' knew how to dress ' is backed up by @entity145 , the design director of one of the politician 's favourite labels , @entity150			0
' she knows precisely what she wants and she 's particular about the fit of the shoulders , ' she said of designing some of her bespoke suits in the @entity8			0
@entity156 staple : her penchant for pearls endured over the decades while the @entity47 knew what she wore in the male dominated world of politics would help her to be taken seriously , she also did not want to lose her femininity			0
' you do not lose your feminine qualities just because you are a prime minister , ' she said			0
this is why she loved her pussybow blouse so much			0
' i often wear bows ; they are rather softening , they are rather pretty , ' she said			0
when it came to the colour of her clothes , she was always keen to tow the party line - maintaining that her favourite shade was always ' my party 's colour ' sapphire blue			1
follower of fashion : the baroness with designer @entity181 appreciated well - tailored clothes lasting appeal : a selection of her outfits were auctioned off at @entity101 in 2012 she often chose to wear this colour for public appearances long after she was voted out of power			1
her fashion choices were often replicated in the @entity8 and thanks to the release of @entity13 film , other elements of her style have revived in popularity including the @entity199 collar and midi length skirt			1
many people have championed her style over the years including handbag entrepreneur @entity203 who once told @entity204 , ' i am a lifelong fan of @entity0			0
' she said : ' @entity0 dressed as a strong woman and developed a style that was very much her own brand			2
the hair , the bow , the pearls and the handbag all became iconic			0

@entity13 always believed in wearing clothes ' in which you are comfortable '
she wanted to be well - dressed because she was ' representing my country '
she admitted her image became ' part of the job ' as *pm*
