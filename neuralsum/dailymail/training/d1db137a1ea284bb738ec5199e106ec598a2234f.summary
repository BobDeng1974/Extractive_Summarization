@entity0 made a robust case for its salary cap on friday after @entity3 claimed that seven @entity0 clubs have indicated they want the existing system scrapped			1
saracens say the the matter will be discussed at a @entity0 shareholders meeting on february 4			0
in a press release issued by the club , @entity3 said they are ' creating a consensus among @entity0 clubs to remove the salary cap , releasing the ' handbrake ' on @entity16 club rugby			1
' @entity17 , who has just agreed to sign for @entity18 , chose @entity19 over the @entity0 @entity0 introduced a salary cap in 1999			1
it is currently £ 5million per club , and will rise by £ 500,000 for next season , when clubs will also be able to nominate two marquee ' excluded players '			2
that decision was a unanimous one made by @entity0 shareholders earlier this year			0
the @entity0 's umbrella organisation described the salary cap as ' a progressive system whereby the maximum spend is linked to revenue increases from tv and other centralised commercial rights			1
' in a statement , @entity0 said : ' the salary cap ensures the financial viability of the member clubs and underpins the sustainable growth of the competition for all stakeholders			1
' in addition , the salary cap provides a level playing field for all clubs , ensures a competitive @entity0 rugby competition ; promotes home - grown players and supports the performance of the @entity16 team , and allows the recruitment of elite players from other countries through the @entity55 provision			1
@entity17 will become rugby 's highest - paid player in the world when he joins @entity18 ' @entity0 keeps the salary cap under constant review and consults with its shareholder clubs to ensure that its regulations remain the most appropriate and proportionate means of achieving its objectives			1
' comments made by @entity3 chief executive @entity66 on friday come ahead of next year 's @entity67 in @entity16 , after which many of the world 's top players are expected to base themselves in @entity71 on lucrative club deals			1
@entity73 star @entity17 has already agreed a £ 1.3million per year contract with wealthy @entity19 club @entity18 , while @entity76 back @entity75 is to join @entity77			0
any changes to the @entity0 salary cap would require a 75 per cent majority of shareholders			1
all @entity83 centre @entity84 is also reportedly fielding overseas offers from a number of different clubs ' the salary cap has served its purpose , ' @entity66 said			1
' it 's time to seize a golden opportunity to grow the game , to ensure a level playing field in @entity71 , to build the strongest league in world rugby and to let players earn market - related salaries			2
' the combination of @entity16 hosting the @entity67 in 2015 and sevens featuring in the 2016 @entity99 creates a historic , but fleeting , platform for rugby union to grow dramatically			2
we must release the handbrake and step on the accelerator			0
' the clubs need to encourage investment , to provide the spectacle and quality deserved by our broadcast partner , @entity110 , and title sponsor , @entity0			2
@entity16 hooker @entity112 revealed this week that he had turned down a big - money move to @entity19 ' it would be a pity if the world 's top players light up the @entity67 on @entity16 soil , and then leave to play club rugby in @entity19			1
if the salary cap is left to forbid the required investment , it will kill any hope of growth			1
' @entity66 said he understood the concerns of some clubs regarding wage inflation if the salary cap was removed			1
' @entity16 clubs must compete in the @entity130 against @entity132 and @entity19 clubs spending two or three times as much on players , ' he added			0
' imagine the likes of @entity136 and @entity137 being asked to compete with @entity138 , @entity139 and @entity140 under those circumstances			0
it would never happen , but it happens in rugby			0
' strong legal opinion suggests the salary cap , as applied , breaches @entity71 competition laws			1
' we understand some clubs fear the removal of the salary cap will cause wage inflation , yet , in reality , salaries are already being driven by the @entity19 clubs			1
we can either sit back and become a second - rate ' lowest common denominator ' league , or we can leap forward			0
' lastly , we must be fair to @entity16 international players , who are encouraged to play club rugby in @entity16 to be eligible for the national team			0
' their salaries should be determined by the free market , nothing less			0
it is simply unfair , inequitable and possibly illegal for their pay to be restrained by the artificial mechanism of an outdated salary cap			2
@entity3 chief executive @entity66 said the cap had to go for @entity16 teams to compete in @entity71 ' @entity172 moves on			2
the game needs to evolve			0
in the interests of @entity16 rugby , in the interests of building the best league in the world , in the interests of the sponsors and broadcasters , in the interests of the players ... it is time to # scrapthecap			0
' @entity187 chief executive @entity186 described friday 's developments as ' somewhat surprising			0
' @entity189 said : ' the comments regarding an abolition of the salary cap were somewhat surprising given we have recently had discussions on this very topic as a league			2
' the fundamentals of this regulation were approved recently at a shareholder meeting , and so i ca n't understand why the issue is being raised again so quickly			0
' if there is a genuine desire to have a fresh discussion on the salary cap , then we are more than happy to have a debate as a league , but in the right way , in the right forum			2
' as a club , @entity187 fully supports the salary cap - it is one of the elements which makes ours one of the most competitive leagues in the world			1
' every game counts in the @entity0 , and that has been more than evident this season			0
most of the great leagues globally have salary caps or systems in place to monitor spending			0

@entity0 's umbrella organisation hits back at @entity3 claim
@entity3 had said seven club support scrapping the salary cap
but @entity0 *adamant* that cap ensures game 's financial viability
clubs worried that top players will go abroad after 2015 @entity67
