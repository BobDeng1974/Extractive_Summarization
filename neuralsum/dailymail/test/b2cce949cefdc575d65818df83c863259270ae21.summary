a property developer in a wealthy @entity2 suburb believes his family are the victims of small - town vengeance which saw his son demoted in the local @entity8 to punish him for threatening the town 's overwhelmingly white ethnic makeup			1
@entity11 , a 50 - year - old from @entity13 , a town of 21,000 with a median household income of $ 200,000 , says his nine - year old was kicked off his team and put in a lower - ranking one just after he proposed developments involving affordable housing			1
according to a lawsuit filed by @entity11 , locals are so worried at the prospect of the town 's black population - currently 70 people , or 0.33 per cent - getting any bigger that they hit back through the medium of baseball			1
small - town fury : @entity11 , 50 , says his nine - year - old son was moved into a lower @entity8 team because his affordable housing homes threatened the ethnic makeup of the extremely white town as well as his son being booted to a lesser team in the league , @entity11 was also banned from coaching			1
the town and the @entity8 both deny that the goings - on of the @entity8 and @entity11 's housing plans are linked			1
in court documents they describe his grievance as ' an imaginary slight that has no connection to reality '			0
@entity50 @entity49 information says that @entity13 is 94 per cent white , with 620 @entity52 residents and fewer than 100 blacks			1
@entity11 said two proposals were rejected by town officials ; a 16 - apartment complex with five affordable units , and a 30 - apartment one with nine affordable units			2
he said : ' @entity13 is a little white enclave , sort of a holdout segregated town			2
the attitudes that people in @entity13 have are very exclusionary , demeaning			0
' when they go after your kids , they 've crossed the line '			0
the town has previously been investigated by the @entity69 over a policy which gave affordable housing priority to people who already lived and worked in @entity13			1
swanky : this photograph shows @entity13 's downtown area , complete with picturesque @entity77 architecture and expensive cars parked up in front of boutique stores the policy was dropped before the investigation finished			0
the lawsuit and a federal housing investigation reopened old wounds in @entity13			0
the town was made famous by the 1947 oscar - winner @entity87 , starring @entity89 , which depicted anti-semitic residents conspiring not to sell property to @entity93			0
@entity11 and his wife , @entity94 , filed the lawsuit in 2013 against the @entity96 those who were in charge when their son was demoted , in fall 2010			2
the demotion came just days after @entity11 filed an affordable housing application for property right next to the home of a former league official			1
several months later , @entity11 was banned from coaching in the league			0
lawyers for the @entity8 deny the allegations and have filed a motion to have the suit dismissed			0
according to court documents , league officials say they made a mistake placing the @entity11 's son on a higher - level team , after the housing application was filed , and corrected the error by moving him to another team			1
sceptical : deli owner @entity120 , pictured in front of his store , does not think the town is conspiring to keep out black people in the application they wrote : ' mr @entity11 is pursuing a baseless litigation as a means to harass and retaliate against defendants for an imaginary slight that has no connection to reality or to the civil rights laws that he purports to vindicate			2
' former @entity8 board members named in the lawsuit declined to comment			0
@entity11 made a total of three affordable housing applications , one of which was ultimately approved			2
the lawsuit includes allegations about city officials blocking affordable housing applications to keep blacks from moving into town , claims identical to those in another pending federal lawsuit against the town by a different affordable housing developer whose project was rejected			2
the @entity50 @entity69 in 2010 began investigating whether the town was violating the @entity155 with a zoning policy approved in 2009 that gave top priority for new affordable housing to @entity13 residents and other people with ties to the town , including town employees			1
the planning and zoning commission rescinded the policy later in 2010 , and the @entity69 closed the investigation in 2012 without taking any action , the @entity165 reported			0
unfortunate reputation : @entity13 was immortalized in 1947 by the likes of @entity89 in @entity87 , which depicted townsfolk conspiring to keep out @entity93 by not selling them property according to state data , 2.6 percent of @entity13 's nearly 7,100 housing units qualify as affordable			2
@entity2 governor @entity176 has called affordable housing one of the state 's most pressing needs and has committed hundreds of millions of dollars for more affordable housing			1
in 2010 , @entity13 won a four - year exemption to a state law making it easier for developers to build in towns with less than 10 percent affordable housing and town officials expect to win another after resolving a dispute with the state			1
the town says it is entitled to the exemption under a complicated formula involving existing affordable housing units			2
@entity13 first selectman @entity196 said the town has made significant efforts to increase affordable housing and its housing practices are n't discriminatory			1
' the @entity13 of today bears no resemblance to the allegations that the @entity204 ... are intending to propagate , ' she said			0
' these folks are developers and they 're looking to develop housing and make some money			0
' @entity208 , owner of @entity209 in downtown @entity13 , said he does n't believe the town is being discriminatory in rejecting affordable housing applications			1
' the town 's small , very tight knit , ' the resident of nearby @entity213 said			0
' that does n't mean we want to keep anyone out			0
it 's a small , little @entity77 town and i think they want to keep it that way			0
