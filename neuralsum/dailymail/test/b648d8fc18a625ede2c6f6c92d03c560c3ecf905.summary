mr @entity8 , who was the first @entity16 player to play a @entity18 match , made the comments when explaining why there were so few women in competitive chess			1
@entity8 has controversially claimed women were not suited to playing chess because it required logical thinking but critics immediately pointed out that he lost a high - profile game against a woman grandmaster			1
he told @entity29 in @entity30 : ‘ why should [ men and women ] function in the same way ? ‘ i do n’t have the slightest problem in acknowledging that my wife [ @entity36 ] possesses a much higher degree of emotional intelligence than i do			2
' likewise , she does n’t feel embarrassed in asking me to manoeuvre the car out of our narrow garage			0
‘ one is not better than the other , we just have different skills			0
it would be wonderful to see more girls playing chess , and at a higher level , but rather than fretting about inequality , perhaps we should just gracefully accept it as a fact			0

‘ let ’s just hope @entity8 did n’t crash his car on those days , trying to park it			2
' at least this resolves the age - old debate as to whether there ’s a direct link between chess - playing ability and intelligence			2
’ mr @entity8 responded to @entity90 ’s comments on @entity91 , writing : you seem to suffer from incomprehension			1
