by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 06:20 est , 13 may 2013 updated : 10:40 est , 13 may 2013 @entity3 , the flamboyant terrorist and self - proclaimed revolutionary who was once one of the @entity6 's most wanted men , today launched an appeal against his life sentence for orchestrating bombings that killed 11 people in @entity11 two decades ago			1
@entity3 , whose real name is @entity3 , is serving two life sentences in @entity11 for a triple murder in 1975 and for the bombings in @entity11 in 1982 and 1983			1
he 's been behind bars since 1994 after @entity11 agents seized him in @entity18			1
today , as he launched an appeal , he demanded new lawyers and accused the @entity22 state of seeking to sabotage his defence by not supplying promised financial support for his existing legal team			0
when the court agreed to provide him with two lawyers funded by the @entity11 state , a laughing @entity29 called out ' one blonde , one brunette ' - a remark for which he was rebuked by the court president			2
behind bars : @entity3 , whose real name is @entity3 , is serving two life sentences in @entity11 for a triple murder in 1975 and for bombings in @entity11 in 1982 and 1983 that killed 11 people and injured over 140 he was convicted of the triple murder in 1997 and the bombings in 2011 after a trial that captivated the world for months			1
but now his lawyer , @entity43 , who is also his wife , is demanding he be sent back to his homeland of @entity22 on the grounds that his capture was illegal because he was n't convicted of a crime until 17 years later			1
for the defence : @entity11 lawyer @entity43 , who is also married to @entity3 his alleged ties to attacks by far - left and @entity52 terror groups made him feared among governments in @entity54 and the @entity55 , but also brought him admirers including the late @entity22 president @entity57			1
in @entity11 @entity29 began an appeal against his life sentence for the bombings			1
the hearing began with him demanding a new lawyer			0
ms @entity43 told one of @entity22 's state - run radio stations that she hoped to meet government officials to discuss the matter			0
it has been 16 years since the @entity22 was handed his first life sentence for the 1975 killing of two unarmed policemen and one of their informers in the @entity11 capital			1
for many , his 1997 incarceration in @entity75 was the end of the story			0
but in 2011 , he was convicted of masterminding four attacks across @entity11 in 1982 and 1983 , which killed 11 people and wounded more than 140			1
but if there was any question that the ageing @entity3 felt any remorse for his crimes , the clenched - fist salute he delivered at the end of that second trial in 2011 made his position very clear : the @entity89 terrorist is still at war with the world			1
@entity29 ' long - running custody battle has , at times , been overshadowed by his love life , that saw him marry his lawyer , ms @entity43 - a petite and highly distinguished 58 - year - old barrister			2
the couple married in @entity75 12 years ago , with @entity3 handing over a platinum @entity100 ring in front of armed guards , before returning to his cell alone			1
indeed , his thoughts at the moment appear to be less concerned with the horrific crimes of which he now stands accused - including causing an explosion on an express train which killed five people — than his ' human right ' to consummate his marriage			0
while his wife claims that - legally - too many years have passed for him to be tried for the bomb attacks , @entity3 has been telling friends of his desire to assuage the ' burning passion ' he and wife both hold for each other			1
he regularly sends the previously married mother - of - three love poems from his cell			0
' ten years is a long time			0
we have every right to be together and to be free , ' said @entity3 , during a recent telephone conversation with a close friend from inside @entity75			2
he has since been placed in solitary confinement for phoning out of the prison without permission			0
' my wife has been waiting long enough and we deserve a honeymoon , ' said @entity3 during the call , adding : ' by the grace of @entity134 and wheeler - dealing between @entity11 and @entity22 , we 'll get one			1
' for her part , @entity136 says she is determined to remould her husband 's image as an unfeeling killing machine into that of warm human being who was ' illegally captured and imprisoned ' by ' politically - motivated ' police			0
' he is not a criminal , ' she has said , ' but a politician , like @entity148			0
' she has pledged to clear his name ' for all time ' and see him return to @entity22 as a released ' political prisoner '			0
she has her work cut out in pleading his case : for @entity3 's reign of terror stretches back to the early 1970s			2
war with the world : if there was any question that the ageing @entity3 felt any remorse for his crimes , the clenched - fist salute he delivered at a court appearance in 2011 made his position very clear rescuers and policemen are seen on the site where a bombed car exploded in @entity169 , near @entity170 in @entity171 on april 22 , 1982			1
the attack was attributed to @entity3 one person died and 63 were wounded in the 1982 @entity171 attack in front of the office of pro-iraqi publication @entity176 the son of left - wing millionaire @entity22 lawyer @entity179 , who named his three sons @entity182 , @entity3 and @entity183 after the leader of @entity187 's @entity186 revolution , @entity3 was a paid - up member of the @entity188 by the age of ten , and spent time as an undergraduate at @entity193 's @entity192 , established by the @entity194 as a training ground for revolutionaries from @entity197 , @entity198 and @entity199			2
by 1970 , he had volunteered for the @entity200 — which is thought to have first given him the codename @entity3 because of his @entity203 lineage — playing an active role for the group in the north of @entity207 during the @entity209 conflict against @entity211 's forces			2
he was also allegedly a part of an attempt on the life of @entity215 , the @entity216 chairman of @entity217 , in @entity218			0
in 1975 - the year he converted from @entity219 to @entity220 - he killed two unarmed policemen and one of their informers in @entity171 after they turned up at his hide - out flat on the @entity225			0
he shot them dead and fled through a window , leaving his fingerprints on both the discarded gun and a whisky bottle			0
in december that year , while still on the run , he became a household name after leading a six - man attack on the @entity233 of @entity234 , the @entity235			0
@entity3 , flamboyantly handsome in sunglasses and a @entity238 beret , took some 70 people hostage , including 11 government ministers			2
three hostages were killed , but dozens of others ended up being forced to fly with him to @entity243 , where a ransom - thought to have been in the region of £ 10 million was eventually paid for their return home			0
then in 1982 and 1983 he masterminded but with the fall of the @entity250 in 1989 , safe havens were harder to come by			2
@entity3 took refuge in @entity18 but was finally captured in the capital @entity253 in 1994 by @entity11 secret servicemen who injected him with a sedative , bound and blindfolded him and flew him back to @entity171 .			1
