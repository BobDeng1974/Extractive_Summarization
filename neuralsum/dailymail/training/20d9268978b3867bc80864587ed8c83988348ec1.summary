there has been much talk in recent months of certain ‘ faces that do n’t fit ’ in the @entity4 set - up ; talented match - winners who do n’t conform to the coaches ’ template			1
well , two of those faces , according to popular perception , will be at the national team ’s training camp next week and possibly beyond			2
maybe , just maybe , they can prove to the management that they fit the bill after all and are worthy of a role at the @entity16			0
wednesday ’s announcement of a training squad to prepare for the @entity20 opener against @entity21 is a diluted version of what was supposed to be unveiled			1
as recently as 10 days ago , @entity24 had been intending to name an elite group of 32 or so players for the entire campaign , but a sudden flurry of injuries have forced an abrupt change			2
@entity31 fly half @entity32 ( centre ) looks to take on the @entity36 defence at the @entity37 @entity32 impressed during his brief cameos for @entity4 against the @entity39 in the 2014 summer tour @entity32 is having a fantastic season at sale — the fly - half is in the @entity46 ’s top five for total points scored and conversions scored			1
points scored 1 - @entity49 ( @entity50 ) : 172 2 - a @entity51 ( @entity52 ) : 144 3 - @entity53 ( @entity54 ) : 127 @entity55 ( @entity56 ) : 136 5 @entity57 ( @entity43 ) : 112 5 @entity58 ( @entity59 ) : 112 conversions scored 1 - @entity53 ( @entity54 ) : 29 1 - @entity55 ( @entity56 ) : 29 3 - @entity49 ( @entity50 ) : 28 @entity61 ( @entity52 ) : 26 5 - @entity62 ( @entity43 ) : 21 instead , this will be a short - term selection , a quick fix in difficult circumstances			1
the coaches have had to hurriedly revise their outlook having lost @entity68 and @entity69 for the whole championship , and @entity71 and @entity72 for at least part of it			1
but while the @entity76 were at pains to clarify that the squad revealed on wednesday would apply only to the @entity21 game on february 6 , it is laden with significance			2
it represents the telling moment when @entity83 have embraced pragmatism and buried preconceptions			0
the proof is provided by the inclusion of two men — @entity32 and @entity89			1
the latter was presumed to have been consigned to history as a @entity93 player			0
the @entity94 was jettisoned by @entity95 when he took over in the aftermath of the calamitous @entity99 campaign overseen by @entity100			1
@entity101 was indelibly linked to that grim period , having reportedly quipped ‘ that ’s £ 35,000 down the toilet ’ when @entity4 lost their quarter - final against @entity106 in @entity107			1
at the age of 36 , his return is a stunning development which suggests a willingness among the management to revise their views about certain players			0
@entity101 has been in consistently outstanding form for several years and believes he is at the peak of his powers			0
his tour de force in @entity122 ’ victory over @entity124 earlier this month led to a swelling call for @entity4 to reconsider him			1
@entity94 8 @entity89 ( left ) chips a grubber kick past @entity52 fly half @entity51 last satuday @entity101 's last appearance in an @entity4 shirt was the @entity99 quarter - final defeat to @entity106 @entity89 is in excellent form this season , and though he has n’t played for @entity4 since 2011 , @entity24 could use the 36 - year - old ’s experience			1
@entity4 matches : 47 points : 25 tries : 5 won : 26 lost : 20 draw : 1 win % : 55 last appearance : october 8 , 2011 v @entity106 the opening has been created by the unfortunate loss of @entity68 for a minimum of six months with a broken leg			1
that started a search for specialist no 8 cover for @entity145 and @entity101 has been preferred to @entity50 ’s @entity146 , fellow chief @entity147 and others such as @entity54 ’s @entity149 and @entity151 ’s @entity150			0
his selection will disprove the notion that @entity95 is fixed on youth , rather than paying heed to the clear evidence of weekly performances			0
@entity101 has clawed his way back into favour through the force of his exploits for @entity122 and because of his evident desperation to represent his country again			0
‘ there is massive unfinished business for me as far as @entity4 is concerned , ’ he said last week			2
‘ my hunger to play for @entity4 is as strong as ever , probably stronger			2
i believe i am a much better player than when i was last capped			0
’ as for @entity32 , his prospects of a recall had appeared less remote , but his selection is significant nonetheless			2
the 27 - year - old fly - half has been regularly superb for sale but was overlooked for the autumn tests despite having performed with distinction whenever the opportunity arose in @entity175 last june			0
@entity56 fly half @entity176 ( left ) is set to start for @entity4 against @entity21 with @entity178 on the bench @entity4 will welcome back a host of players for the @entity20 including @entity182 ( left ) and @entity183 that trip marked his breakthrough after a long international exile , but his recent struggle for recognition opened up the prospect of a summer move to @entity192			1
now , however , as he finds himself in the mix to push for a @entity16 place , @entity32 is seemingly destined to sign a new deal at @entity43			2
he is likely to play for the @entity196 against @entity197 in @entity198 next friday before making a big push in training to install himself as third - choice no 10 behind @entity176 and @entity178 and ahead of @entity202 of @entity54			0
elsewhere , the most notable feature of the squad announced on wednesday will be the return of several players missing from the november campaign — @entity208 , @entity182 , @entity183 and @entity209			0
@entity211 ’s hot streak for @entity56 means he is retained in the squad with more chance of claiming a midfield berth than he had two months ago , while club - mate @entity215 will also be a starting contender			1
@entity50 ’s @entity216 is set to return at the expense of @entity218			0
the squad is supposedly for one match only , but the home encounter with @entity222 is only eight days after the @entity224 collision , so those who excel there will have every chance of keeping their places .			0

@entity32 has been *rewarded* for his superb form with @entity31
@entity89 has not featured for @entity4 since the @entity99
@entity211 ’s hot streak for @entity56 means he is retained in the squad
@entity68 and @entity69 will miss the entire championship
@entity71 and @entity72 are major injury *doubts*
