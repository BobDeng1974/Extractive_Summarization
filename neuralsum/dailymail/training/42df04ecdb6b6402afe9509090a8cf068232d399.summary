@entity7 's guilty verdict was overturned earlier this year - but now prosecutors have failed to file an expected appeal meaning she will be released in just weeks			1
known as @entity10 , 48 - year - old @entity7 's was found guilty in 1989 for the gruesome slaying of her toddler son @entity12 who was shot three times in the back of the head and dumped in the desert			1
ready for release : @entity7 , left , had her murder conviction overturned after spending more than 20 years on death row for the killing of her 4 - year - old son , @entity12 , right , in december 1989 spared : @entity7 would have been the first woman executed in @entity3 since the 1930s had her appeals run out but a @entity25 @entity27 judge has agreed with her lawyers that ruled that the conviction had been due in part because of a crooked cop who had a history of lying under oath			1
@entity7 's conviction was overturned on march 14th allowing prosecutors to launch an appeal to hold a retrial within 30 days			1
no application for a retrial has been filed which means she could soon be a free woman			0
the move marked a surprising turn in a case that made national headlines due to the brazen and disturbing nature of the crime			0
prosecutors said in december 1989 , @entity7 dressed up her son @entity12 in his favorite outfit and told him he was going to see @entity51 at a @entity53 mall during the holidays			1
instead , he was taken into a ravine in the desert by her boyfriend , @entity58 and another man called @entity60 and shot three times in the back of the head as part of what prosecutors said was a plot by @entity7 and the two other defendants to collect a $ 50,000 life insurance policy			1
@entity7 , who was not present at the crime , was convicted in 1990 of murder , conspiracy to commit murder , child abuse and kidnapping on the strength of testimony by @entity79 detective @entity78 , who said she confessed to the crimes			1
the detective testified that @entity7 told him she had contemplated having an abortion while pregnant with @entity12 and had complained to @entity83 about her son			1
@entity83 was hardly an ideal babysitter			0
he had @entity85 stemming in large part from an incident during the war when he shot and killed a young @entity90 boy who had climbed onto a truck transporting @entity83 and other @entity92 in @entity90 , according to court documents			0
in his 1985 personal journal , now part of court records , @entity83 wrote : ' losing sleep because of dreams in @entity90 [ sic ] seeing kids including my own and wondering if i 'm going to do something to hurt them , and remembering the ones i had to kill			0
' with @entity12 in the car , @entity83 picked up his good friend @entity58			0
the two men did not take @entity12 to see @entity51			0
instead , they drove @entity12 into the desert , where @entity83 emptied three bullets into the boy 's head			0
@entity7 was convicted in 1990 of murder , conspiracy to commit murder , child abuse and kidnapping in a plot to collect a $ 50,000 life insurance policy the @entity53 police department 's star interrogator , @entity117			1
@entity119 , was called in on his day off to separately question the three			0
in a matter of hours , @entity78 had secured a speedy resolution to the horrific high - profile holiday crime.the detective said she confessed to conspiring to the murder , although she protested her innocence and denied the claim			2
the three suspects were tried separately , convicted , and sentenced to die			0
@entity7 would have been the first woman executed in @entity3 since the 1930s had her appeals run out			1
the @entity131 had gone so far to issue a death warrant for @entity7 in 1997 , but the execution was delayed because she had yet to exhaust federal appeals			2
during her original trial , the prosecution failed to disclose information about a history of misconduct by @entity140			1
that record included multiple court rulings in four other cases that @entity78 either lied under oath or violated suspects ’ miranda rights during interrogations			0
prosecutors are required to provide a defendant ’s lawyers with material that might support a not - guilty verdict , including material that could undermine the credibility of a prosecution witness			2
there was no other witness or recording of the purported confession by @entity7 , who has proclaimed her innocence			1
in court proceedings and press interviews , @entity7 professed her innocence , claiming @entity78 had a history of lying under oath and had fabricated her confession			1
the trial amounted to ‘ a swearing contest ’ in which the judge and jury ultimately believed the detective over @entity171 , but they did n’t know of his record of dishonesty and misconduct			2
the ruling reversed a @entity25 @entity168 ’s ruling and ordered the lower court to require @entity3 authorities to turn over all relevant personnel records for the detective			2
key witness : @entity7 , left , was found guilty on the strength of testimony by a @entity53 police detective , who said the mother told him she had contemplated having an abortion while pregnant with @entity12 , right in 2009 , defense attorney @entity188 said his client maintains her innocence and was a loving mother who still grieves her son ’s death			1
‘ our main concern is the fact that i have a client that never confessed and a police detective who said she gave a confession , ’ @entity188 said then			2
‘ there was no tape recorder , no witnesses , nothing			0
’ in march the @entity205 reversed @entity7 's conviction in what chief judge @entity207 dubbed a ' troubling case			1
' he called into question what he said was @entity78 's possible ' misogynistic ' attitude towards vulnerable civilian women over whom he had power and noted @entity78 had a documented history of lying under oath			2
@entity207 's blistering 60 - page opinion and other court records shed light on the alleged police corruption , prosecutorial overreach and judicial carelessness that fused into a miscarriage of justice that might have sentenced an innocent woman to death			1
@entity7 testified she did n't know @entity12 had died until @entity78 informed her of his death in an interrogation room			0
she said she was ' in shock ' and ' reeling ' but the detective moved close to her and put his hands on her knees			0
she told the jury she had n't understood her @entity236 rights and had asked for a lawyer , but instead @entity78 continued interrogating her and twisted her words into a fake confession			0
' she was one of the worst witnesses i 've ever seen , ; recalls @entity53 journalist @entity242 , who covered the trial			0
although he destroyed his notes of the interview and failed to tape record it , @entity78 testified that @entity7 confessed she worried that @entity12 would grow up to be just like his father , a substance - abusing ex-con			1
that 's why she ' wanted @entity250 to take care of @entity12 , ' @entity78 testified			0
after @entity7 was convicted , her defense investigators spent 7,000 hours poring over court records			0
they discovered eight separate cases in which judges determined that @entity78 either had lied under oath or violated the constitutional rights of people he interrogated			0
but @entity259 , the judge , still decided that @entity78 was more credible than @entity7 court records indicate that neither @entity83 nor @entity58 would testify against @entity7			1
in overturning @entity7 ’s conviction , the appellate court did n’t find her innocent			2
' @entity7 may well be guilty , even if @entity78 made up her confession out of whole cloth , ' @entity207 wrote			2
' after all , it 's hard to understand what reason @entity83 and @entity58 would have had for killing a four - year - old boy			1
then again , what reason would they have to protect her if they knew she was guilty ? ' @entity7 , now 49 , was jailed the day after @entity12 's death			2
she is one of three women on death row in @entity3 and has been behind bars for 25 years and on death row for 22 years			0
the two men convicted in the @entity7 ’s case , @entity58 and former @entity171 roommate @entity83 , are also both on death row			0
@entity58 confessed during a police interrogation and led detectives to the boy ’s body , but neither @entity58 or @entity83 would testify against @entity7 .			2

' @entity10 's ' conviction due in part because of detective lying under oath
judge decided to believe police officer over mom of four - year - old son
@entity7 would have been the first woman executed in @entity3 since the 1930s
prosecutors failed to disclose lead detective , who claimed he obtained a confession , had past misconduct issues
