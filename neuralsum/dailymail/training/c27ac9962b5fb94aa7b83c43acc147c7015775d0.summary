by @entity0 , @entity1 published : 04:32 est , 28 february 2013 updated : 12:17 est , 28 february 2013 @entity2 has refused to publicly back the way @entity4 has handled scandalous allegations against former @entity7 chief @entity6			1
the prime minister was asked if he had full confidence in mr @entity4 's handling of the affair			1
speaking from @entity13 where he is attending a forum with @entity16 and @entity17 leaders , the prime minister said : ' obviously these are serious issues and serious matters and they need to be taken seriously			0
@entity2 refused to back @entity4 's handling of the ' very serious ' allegations ' the @entity7 have set up two inquiries into this issue			1
i think you have to let those inquiries take place and make sure , as i ’ve said before , they get to the bottom of these very important allegations			0
' his refusal to say he had full confidence in mr @entity4 comes after former @entity7 activist @entity34 said she would take her complaints about @entity6 to the police			1
@entity37 has launched an investigation into the allegations			0
mr @entity2 's remarks also follow revelations that mr @entity4 was warned a second senior @entity7 figure had made unwanted advances to women but did nothing about it			1

the complainant said mr @entity68 was a ' liability to women , the public and your party			2
' yet despite this , no investigation was ever held , according to @entity77			0
the letter was received months after mr @entity68 was arrested – but not charged – over allegations that he had made sexual advances on a constituent who had contacted him for help with a noisy neighbour			2
the alleged victim is now suing the mp over what she said was a ten - month inappropriate relationship , during which he is accused of placing his hand on her breast , exposing himself and kissing her without consent			0
the @entity7 have been rocked by allegations against former chief executive @entity6 ( left ) and mp @entity68 a @entity7 spokesman said last night : ‘ if we ’ve not replied to a letter , that ’s not acceptable and we ’ll look into why that happened			1
there was a police investigation into @entity68 but no action was subsequently taken			0
‘ there is currently a civil claim being made and it ’s not appropriate to comment further			0
’ three years ago mr @entity68 hit the headlines when his 25 - year - old researcher was arrested – accused of being a @entity109 spy			2
the @entity7 are already on the backfoot over claims that they ignored complaints from women of unwanted touching from the party 's former chief executive @entity6			1
when confronted over why he failed to act , mr @entity4 also took a swipe at the press , saying they should stop being ' self appointed detectives ' and let the experts investigate			0
his remarks backfired , however , with women complainants , saying he was blaming the free press while senior party figures had been sweeping the issue under the carpet for years .			0

@entity131 asked if he had confidence in his *deputy* 's handling of @entity6 scandal which has rocked the @entity7
