by @entity1 reporter published : 11:09 est , 2 september 2012 updated : 02:26 est , 3 september 2012 the cost of land to be used for development of the high - speed rail line between @entity6 and @entity7 has been dramatically reduced by the government			1
officials have cut the ' landscape value ' of some of @entity14 's finest countryside by as much as 90 per cent , it was reported			2
the new figures were only discovered after campaigners against the 109 - mile route going through the @entity6 green belt and the @entity19 - an @entity20 ( @entity21 ) - made a number of request under the @entity24			1
protest : a sign marks the spot where a new rail bridge is proposed to be built across the countryside for the new @entity30 high speed train link at the village of @entity32 in @entity33 officials use the ' landscape impact value ' to quantify in cash terms how much damage a development will do to @entity39 's green space and the environment			2
it is different criteria from the commercial or sale value of the land			2
in the official 2010 assessment of damage to the landscape , it emerged that the estimate by @entity30 which is building the line , was £ 4.3 billion			1
just under £ 1.1 billion was estimated for the @entity6 green belt and @entity21			0
but new figures issued by the @entity53 now reveal that the route 's damage would cost £ 978 million - down 78 per cent - and the @entity6 impact would be £ 114 million , down 90 per cent on the 2010 figure			1

they have based their figures on seven categories with urban parkland being the most valuable , followed by @entity72 and other unspoilt natural land and then green belt the third most valuable.in the new assessment , almost all the @entity6 green belt and @entity20 land along @entity30 ’s proposed route has been demoted , for valuation purposes , to the lowest category of ' intensive farmland ' worth just £ 103 per @entity82 , of the @entity83 , claimed that the move established a precedent that the ' most precious green space can be devalued whenever the government wants to build on it badly enough			1

' earlier today chancellor @entity100 signalled he wanted to speed up planning laws which would allow developers to build on the green belt as long as the green space is replaced by the local authorities			0
research by the @entity107 ( @entity107 ) published last week warned that green belt land around cities and towns was under threat from plans for at least 81,000 homes , as well as roads , industrial parks , mines and airport growth			0
there would be an expansion of @entity7 airport , proposals for freight terminals near @entity123 , @entity124 and @entity125 , an opencast coal mine at @entity127 , @entity128 , and a hotel and golf course in @entity131 , @entity132			0
a spokesman for the @entity53 described the @entity30 's 2010 estimates as ' crude ' because they did not include a number of factors including extra tunnelling			0
the estimate was ' not comparable ' to the recent more sophisticated exercise , it was reported .			0
