the young fan saved up birthday money and spent almost £ 100 on his favourite player 's shirt , only for the @entity12 midfielder to change his squad number a month later			1
afraid that he will now be teased , @entity13 is refusing to wear his shirt , and the club 's @entity15 refused to change the number for him free of charge			1
however , the club did not inform supporters of the planned change until sunday , august 17 - exactly a month after the new home shirt had been released			1
@entity4 has played under number 44 for three years after joining the club as a 16 - year - old			1
his young fan @entity36 has now refused to wear the @entity38 strip , which cost him £ 93.20 in total , fearing he may be teased about it			1
and despite pleas from his mother @entity43 , the club 's @entity15 have told him ca n't have a new shirt , as any printing is done at the shirt owner 's risk			1
mrs @entity48 , 45 , has now hit out at the club saying they have let the boy down			0
the mother - of - three , who lives in @entity53 , @entity54 , said : ' he 's united mad			2
he has spent all summer at football camp and it 's all he ever talks about			2
@entity57 dashed : @entity36 had spent months waiting to get his hands on the new kit but he says it is now ' ruined ' ' he could n't wait to get the new shirt and kept asking when i was ordering it			2
' he 'd only worn it two or three times when we found out he [ @entity4 ] had changed number			2
' we emailed and asked them if he could change it and they said no because there was a disclaimer with all printing			0
' a few weeks ago the club replaced a shirt where someone had spelt @entity76 wrong			0
' yet we have done nothing wrong and have been left out of pocket			0
if we had any idea it was going to change i would have made him wait rather than see him disappointed			0
' last - minute change : @entity4 joined the club at 16 in 2011 and played under the number 44 until this summer a short - sleeved home shirt from the @entity89 costs £ 42			1
but additional lettering costs £ 9.95			0
mrs @entity48 also bought shorts , priced at £ 20 , with an additional cost of £ 6 to print the number 44			1
and socks , which cost £ 12			0
she says the system needs to change as @entity36 is ' devastated '			0
' @entity36 wanted the third kit as well but i 've put a stop to that now			0
i 'm not going to let him spend money on a shirt that could be out of date straight away			2
