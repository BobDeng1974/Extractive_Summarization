by @entity0 published : 02:07 est , 21 september 2013 updated : 10:52 est , 21 september 2013 when freelance writer @entity1 logged on to her @entity4 service and saw that a picture of a cross-dressing man planting a kiss on a young woman had been uploaded – it gave her quite a shock			1
after all , she did n’t know who the pair were – and the image had been taken using an iphone stolen from her a few months ’ previously			2
and that was n’t the only picture the stolen @entity14 had synced to @entity4			2
dressed to impress : this photo appeared on @entity1 's @entity4 service after her @entity14 was stolen who are these men ? several ' selfie ' shots of strangers also appeared on ms @entity26 's @entity4 account several headshots of two men appeared along with a snap of a man sitting next to a @entity32 sign			1
the phone was taken from ms @entity26 , 30 , in june in @entity34 , south @entity35			1
she immediately reported the theft , had the phone blocked by provider @entity38 and lamented the fact that she would have to take an old phone with her on holiday to @entity42 shortly afterwards			1
she told @entity46 : ‘ it was stolen outside a cashpoint on @entity48 at the end of a night out			0
i had lost my friend and between the moment when i pulled the phone out to call her and the moment when i turned round to take money out of the machine , the phone was taken			1
we called the device which rang and then immediately went dead			0
smiles better : @entity1 during happier times with her @entity14 ‘ i had to take a handset from the dark ages on holiday			1
forget a camera , it did n't even have predictive text			0
i think the damage to my thumbs is reversible , but the emotional trauma , that i have to live with forever			0
' a small clue as to who might have the phone appeared the following morning , but it was n’t enough to crack the case			2
ms @entity26 said : ‘ the very next day i checked @entity4 - where all my contacts were stored - and noticed something funny in the notes section			0
a shopping list in @entity76 ! i called the police immediately but they said unless i knew where the phone was , there was nothing they could do and this was not enough to go on			1
’ however , the trail warmed up just recently when ms @entity26 received a new @entity14 and connected to @entity4 again			0
the batch of photos featuring complete strangers had been streamed to it , along with several new phone numbers			1
one number was labelled as @entity91 ! , @entity76 for ‘ my new number ’ – and ms @entity26 decided to call it			1
someone answered , but promptly hung up			0
@entity46 also rang this number , but again , the person who answered quickly ended the call			0
although ms @entity26 felt ‘ totally violated ’ when she saw the pictures , they have given the police something more to work with			1
@entity102 ! the @entity76 note that mysteriously appeared on ms @entity26 's @entity4 account going underground : the police have confirmed that they would like to speak to the people featured in the photos face time : this young man enjoys the sunshine , perhaps not realising that he using a stolen @entity14 it is not clear , however , which if any of the people pictured in the photographs now has the phone , or if they knew it was stolen			1
a @entity118 spokesman said : ‘ i can confirm that an allegation was made to police of a mobile phone theft that took place in @entity48 in the early hours of the 22 june			1
‘ officers would like to speak to the men pictured in the images in connection with the investigation			2
there have been no arrests			0
’ if you think you can help the police with this case call @entity133 on 0800 555 111			2
cloud is a free service that works with applications on an @entity14 , @entity137 , @entity138 , @entity139 or pc to automatically and wirelessly store customers ' content in @entity4 and automatically and wirelessly push it to all their devices			2
when anything changes on one of the devices , they all wirelessly update almost instantly			0
for example , when a photo is taken on an @entity14 - as in the case of write @entity1 - it is sent to the user ’s @entity4 account and then automatically downloaded to the user ’s @entity137 , laptop and computer , making it both a storage tool and a system to keep all data synchronised across multiple devices			1
the @entity4 service secures data by encrypting it when it is sent over the @entity163 , storing it in an encrypted format when kept on server and using secure tokens for authentication			0
this means users ' data is protected from unauthorised access both while it is being transmitted and when it is stored in the cloud			2
@entity4 uses the same level of security employed by major financial institutions – and never provides encryption keys to any third parties			0
because all the user ’s data is stored remotely by @entity4 , it means that if an @entity14 , @entity137 or computer is stolen , the contents will not be lost			0

theft victim @entity1 also found several headshots , a shopping list in @entity76 and new phone numbers on her cloud account
