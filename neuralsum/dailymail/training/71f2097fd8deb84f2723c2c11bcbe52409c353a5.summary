@entity0 has patented a smart contact lens that could see its @entity3 wearable computer fit inside a smart lens			1
the firm has already developed a contact lens for diabetics analyses their tears , warning them if their glucose levels are low			1
now it has revealed plans for a lens with a camera built in - opening the possibility of its @entity3 system being shrunk down significantly , offering features such as ' superzoom ' to wearers and even helping the blind see			1
the system can be wirelessly linked to a mobile phone for data access and to issue commands via audio , although it is unclear if the lens would be powered wirelessly or have a wired link to a battery			0
according to @entity39 , the system could even be used to help the blind see			2
' for example , a blind person wearing @entity0 's contact lens with a built - in camera may be walking on a sidewalk and approaching an intersection , ' it says			1
' the analysis component of the contact lens can process the raw image data of the camera to determine processed image data indicating that the blind person is approaching intersection with a crosswalk and establish that there is a car approaching the intersection			1
' the lens also has wireless capabilities allowing it to link to a smartphone , which can be used to process data and give the user audio commands			2
@entity0 also says the system will be able to detect faces , potentially allowing the blind to recognise people			2
the firm has already developed a smart lens capable of measuring the glucose level of diabetics			1
the technology could eventually allow @entity0 to shrink its @entity3 computer ( pictured ) into a contact lens @entity0 is testing a prototype for a smart contact lens that we built to measure glucose in tears continuously using a wireless chip and miniaturized glucose sensor			1
the smart contact lens can measure glucose levels in tears using a tiny wireless chip and miniaturized glucose sensor that are embedded between two layers of soft contact lens material			0
prototypes generate a reading once per second			0
@entity0 is also investigating the potential for this to serve as an early warning for the wearer , integrating tiny led lights that could light up to indicate that glucose levels have crossed above or below certain thresholds			2
' you ’ve probably heard that diabetes is a huge and growing problem — affecting one in every 19 people on the planet , ' @entity0 said in a blog post announcing the research			0
' but you may not be familiar with the daily struggle that many people with diabetes face as they try to keep their blood sugar levels under control			0
' uncontrolled blood sugar puts people at risk for a range of dangerous complications , some short - term and others longer term , including damage to the eyes , kidneys and heart			0
' a friend of ours told us she worries about her mom , who once passed out from low blood sugar and drove her car off the road ' the project 's co-founders , @entity128 and @entity129 , say they hope the technology could eventually become commonplace			2
how it works : the chip includes a sensor , chip and antenna to let wearers know when their glucose levels are dangerously low the firm is already in discussion with the @entity140 over the project ' we ’re now testing a smart contact lens that ’s built to measure glucose levels in tears using a tiny wireless chip and miniaturized glucose sensor that are embedded between two layers of soft contact lens material , ' they said			1
' we ’re testing prototypes that can generate a reading once per second			0
how they are made : the process starts with a tiny chip , which is then mounted on a ring with the antenna and sensor , and finally mounted onto the lens			0
the technology is sandwiched inbetween two lenses ' we ’re also investigating the potential for this to serve as an early warning for the wearer , so we ’re exploring integrating tiny led lights that could light up to indicate that glucose levels have crossed above or below certain thresholds			1
' it ’s still early days for this technology , but we ’ve completed multiple clinical research studies which are helping to refine our prototype			0
' we hope this could someday lead to a new way for people with diabetes to manage their disease			0
' the firm is in discussions with the @entity140 , but says ' there ’s still a lot more work to do to turn this technology into a system that people can use			0
it hopes to work with other medical firms to develop the lenses and other smart health monitoring devices .			1
