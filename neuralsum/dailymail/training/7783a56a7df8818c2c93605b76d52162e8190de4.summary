@entity0 was able to parade a glittering line - up of star supporters from the worlds of film , music and television when he first won power – and even his successor , @entity8 , managed to gain the backing of @entity11 and a supermodel			0
but with fewer than three months to go until polling day , @entity12 – who recently advertised for a new ‘ celebrity endorsement ’ adviser – appears to be struggling to win the backing of the celebrities his party could once count upon			1
the news comes after the previously ‘ staunchly @entity24 ’ tv presenters @entity21 said they could not picture him as prime minister			1
doctor who star @entity29 ( right ) has not given a view with fewer than three months to go until polling day , @entity12 ( pictured ) appears to be struggling to win the backing of the celebrities his party could once count upon @entity33 ( left ) had nothing to say when asked about her support of @entity12			1
a spokesman for @entity37 ( right ) said the @entity39 star ' does n’t align herself to any particular political party ' as the @entity24 leader prepares to woo the ‘ creative industries ’ by making a major speech on the arts tomorrow , @entity41 can reveal the results of its own investigation into @entity12 ’s celebrity problem			1
we contacted ten public figures who enthused about @entity24 at the last election			1
of those , only one – the transvestite comedian and veteran @entity24 activist @entity54 – said he would be backing @entity57 despite persistent approaches from this newspaper , previously pro-labour stars were conspicuously silent			1
among them was @entity27 author @entity26 , who gave £ 1 million to @entity24 in 2008 when mr @entity8 was leader			1
supermodel @entity62 ( left ) and business guru @entity63 ( right ) failed to respond to requests for comment over whether they will be backing @entity12 actor @entity67 ( left ) did not offer a quote when asked for his endorsement of mr @entity12			1
a spokesman for @entity71 said they had ‘ no idea ’ whether the @entity75 singer would be voting for mr @entity12 however , when asked about her current voting plans , her spokesman said : ‘ @entity26 is not planning to publicly announce who she will be supporting			1
’ it was a similar story with pop star @entity33 , who said in 2010 : ‘ i ca n’t not vote @entity24			1
’ however , when contacted last week , ms @entity33 ’s spokesman said : ‘ no comment			1
’ in 2010 , @entity39 star @entity37 pledged : ‘ i ’m more @entity24 than @entity24			1
’ this time , her spokesman said : ‘ @entity37 does n’t align herself to any particular political party			0
’ at the last election , @entity11 star @entity29 said : ‘ i would rather have @entity8 than @entity85			1
’ but when asked if the same applied to @entity12 , mr @entity29 ’s spokesman said : ‘ we ca n’t reach @entity29 for a comment			1
’ five years ago , @entity90 actor @entity67 backed @entity24			1
when mr @entity67 was asked last week for his endorsement of mr @entity12 , a spokesman said : ‘ we may have a quote for you later			1
’ ten minutes later , she said : ‘ sorry – no quote			0
’ former @entity97 boss sir @entity96 ( left ) failed to respond to requests for comment but transvestite comedian and veteran @entity24 activist @entity54 ( right ) – said he would be backing @entity12 at the last election , @entity75 singer @entity71 backed mr @entity8 , but this time a spokesman said they had ‘ no idea ’ whether mr @entity71 would be voting for mr @entity12			1
a further three @entity24 backers in 2010 – former @entity97 boss sir @entity96 , supermodel @entity62 and business guru @entity63 – failed to respond to requests for comment			2
only mr @entity54 vowed to provide public support for mr @entity12			1
@entity108 appears to be concerned			0
the party has advertised for a £ 33,000 - a - year endorsement officer ‘ to forge new relationships with celebrities ’			2
yesterday , @entity24 said its well - known supporters included the artist @entity114 , the actor @entity114 and the comic @entity115			1
a spokesman added : ‘ we have a great spread of celebrity and high - profile figures supporting @entity24			1
’ the @entity121 has named footballers @entity122 and @entity124 , cricketer @entity125 , artist @entity126 and sir @entity127 among its supporters			0
@entity131 even the man who 's paid to impersonate the @entity24 leader says he has a ' fake image problem ' if there ’s one thing that everyone knows , it ’s that @entity12 has an image problem , writes impressionist and comedian @entity138			1
even @entity24 supporters like me know it			2
it dogged him before his leadership and has only grown worse over the last five years			0
lots of @entity144 types bang on about how he needs to change his image to connect with the public , that his appearance and voice are a major barrier to people warming to him			0
he wo n’t change his image and neither should he , at least not in the way that some people think he should			0
i hope he does n’t , because as an impressionist , he ’s an absolute gift to me and if he becomes prime minister he ’ll keep me in work for at least another five years			0
poor political judgment is more damaging than a superficially bad image			0
@entity24 supporters who believe his problems are only skin deep need to ask themselves a simple question			2
if @entity12 radically overhauled his image , would it deliver a @entity24 majority ? the answer is , of course , no. ' absolute gift ' : @entity138 as @entity12 i ’m not saying that @entity12 does n’t have to change the way he handles himself , but there ’s a difference between an image problem and not being yourself			1
@entity12 behaves in that way that so many modern politicians do			2
the faux - concern , shown by a slightly ruffled brow			0
the synthetic body language , complete with the thumb - point			0
a lot of it was borrowed from @entity182 and most of @entity12 ’s physical routine is a poor imitation of @entity0			2
@entity12 should chill out a bit and be more of himself			2
being nerdy in itself is n’t the problem that people think it is			0
there ’s no merit in trying to label @entity12 as an underdog			2
this is politics , it ’s not the 3rd round of the @entity197			0
we want people who can lead and succeed			0
this is where @entity12 has a problem			2
he suffers from a lack of authority , caused by the lack of a coherent policy direction and bad judgment			0
take his recent attacks on business			0
when @entity12 launched his attack on tax dodgers he should have had a host of business leaders sounded out beforehand and ready to do media rounds as part of a co-ordinated campaign to prove that @entity24 has successful friends who think he should be prime minister			1
this did n’t happen for one of two reasons			0
either it was n’t planned properly – which shows bad judgment – or it was n’t possible because not enough successful business people were willing to support him			0
in terms of election manifesto , it does n’t feel like @entity24 has anything really big to say			1
the cost of living crisis is genuine but it ’s going to take more than freezing energy bills at an already high rate to reverse it			0
@entity12 should be talking about @entity234 beyond the deficit , about our hopes and dreams			2
@entity24 supporters like me want to hear about the jobs of the future and not just in an empty slogan			2
i want to know what they are and how @entity12 would get them here			2
the @entity247 has n’t made most people excited about the future , but @entity24 has completely failed to capitalise on this			2
i long to hear @entity12 talk the language of ambition – even if only in his nerdy voice – but he does n’t			0
like many other people , i long to feel inspired about the future of @entity234 and want to feel like the governance of the country is in safe hands			0
@entity85 or @entity258 do n’t fit the bill			0
but the brutal truth is , i doubt @entity12 does either			0
@entity138 is currently performing his stand - up show 24 - hour political party people around the country .			0
