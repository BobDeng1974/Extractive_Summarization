@entity1 boss @entity0 will persist with struggling midfield trio @entity2 , @entity3 and @entity4 as he refuses to shuffle his squad so late in the season			1
@entity0 had to answer questions about his three midfielders after the hard - fought 2 - 1 home win over @entity10			2
asked whether @entity4 is struggling , as he was substituted at half - time , @entity0 said : ‘ no , i do n’t think he had a bad performance , i just think he was not good enough , which is a huge difference			1
@entity4 tries a flick that does n't come off during a disappointing display against @entity10 on saturday @entity0 insists he will stick by his players despite the three midfielders ' decline in form recently @entity2 runs with the ball , but the assists have dried up for the @entity24 international in recent weeks ‘ for me football is not just mathematics			1
when some people write that @entity2 drops his level because the number of assists are not the same , the number of assists are probably not the same because the player that he assists does not score			0
’ ‘ @entity3 , he was suspended , and after the suspension he was injured celebrating in the final , so he went back and he was not in the best condition			2
‘ i always think stability is very important in a team , and it ’s not in april that you are going to make important changes			0
’ @entity41 was @entity1 's best player , scoring a penalty before @entity43 stunned the hosts with an equaliser from his own half			0
@entity47 sealed the points , after @entity41 laid the chance on a plate for him , and kept the @entity51 in command at the top of the table			0
@entity4 was withdrawn at half time but his manager insisted he was not struggling and will bounce back @entity3 holds off a tackle in midfield , but even the defensive midfielder has been short of his best			1

@entity2 has not been at his best since turn of the year
@entity4 was withdrawn at half - time in win over @entity10 on saturday
@entity3 ' not in the best condition ' according to @entity0
but @entity1 manager *determined* to stick with his stars in title race
