@entity1 batsmen @entity0 and @entity2 struck inspired centuries during a record fourth - wicket partnership at the @entity5 on sunday to help @entity1 claw their way back into the third test against @entity9 on day three			1
the pair united with @entity1 vulnerable at 147 - 3 in the morning and were finally separated at 409 - 4 after tea , having creamed 262 runs off @entity9 's hapless bowlers before spinner @entity14 had @entity0 trapped lbw for 147			1
@entity2 , enjoying an outstanding series with three centuries , pushed on to 169 before he was dismissed courtesy of wicketkeeper @entity19 's second brilliant catch of the day			2
@entity2 celebrates after reaching his century as @entity1 fought back against @entity9 in @entity5 @entity2 ( right ) and @entity0 put on a fourth - wicket partnership of 262 runs to frustrate @entity9 @entity0 hits out during his innings of 147 at the @entity5 as @entity19 looks on rahane bats as a seagull flies past him as @entity1 closed to within 68 runs of @entity9 's mammoth total his wicket brought stumps , with @entity32 nine not out and @entity1 having reached 462 - 8 , trailing @entity9 's mammoth first innings total of 530 by 68 runs with two wickets in hand			1
@entity2 lost three batting partners in quick succession , with debutant @entity42 holing out for three , captain @entity37 lasting 11 runs and spinner @entity39 dismissed for a duck			0
though @entity9 fought back admirably late in the session , they had no answers to the brilliance of @entity2 and @entity0 for over four hours , the pair lashing 39 boundaries between them on a warm , sunny day			1
@entity9 's main strike bowler @entity52 came in for some special punishment , leaching 27 runs in two overs after tea as his short - pitched assault was dismissed with arrogance			2
@entity14 eventually claimed the wicket of @entity0 , trapping him lbw for 147 @entity2 dives into his crease during his innings of 169 as @entity1 chased @entity9 's big total of 530 @entity52 and @entity2 exchange words on what was a largely frustrating day for the bowlers @entity2 had been knocked to the ground as @entity52 took a shy at the stumps @entity2 pulled @entity52 to the fence three times in one of the overs to have the large @entity73 contingent in the crowd of 42,000 roaring their approval			1
the @entity78 @entity77 ultimately had @entity2 caught behind but he ended the day with the ugly figures of 1 - 133			2
@entity9 had earlier taken two wickets in the first hour , but would rue two dropped catches in the middle session that could have ended @entity2 and @entity0 's stand much earlier			1
@entity84 contrived to spill the simplest of catches off his own bowling to reprieve @entity0 on 70 , while @entity88 grounded a sharp chance at first slip to grant @entity2 a life before tea			0
it took umpire @entity95 's intervention to split the pair , the @entity97 raising his finger for lbw when @entity0 missed a sweep - shot , though replays suggested the middle order batsman may have been hard done by			0
@entity37 gets down on his knees to play a sweep shot but he only made 11 runs before being dismissed @entity106 celebrates with his team - mates after taking the wicket of @entity37 @entity106 also removed @entity39 caught and bowled for a duck wicketkeeper @entity19 makes a remarkable diving catch to remove @entity111 the crowd at the @entity5 get into the spirit of the occasion with a @entity116 wave @entity42 lasted a flighty eight balls , dropped on the seventh by substitute fielder @entity119 at midwicket after an unsightly slog , only to be caught on the next @entity84 delivery at backward square leg by @entity125 courtesy of another appalling stroke			0
@entity37 survived for a streaky 11 before feathering an edge off @entity106 through to @entity19 , and the bulky paceman caught @entity39 off his own bowling soon after			0
@entity19 earlier notched his 250th dismissal with a brilliant , diving catch to remove @entity111 for 25 on the second ball of the day , having dropped him on 12 late on day two			0
@entity9 lead the four - match series 2 - 0 after wins in @entity135 and @entity136 and can seal it in @entity5 with a draw .			0

@entity2 hit 169 and @entity0 147 to keep @entity1 in contention
the *tourists* ended day three 68 ruins behind @entity9 's total of 530
the @entity1 pair put on a record fourth - wicket stand of 262 at the @entity5
@entity0 was eventually trapped lbw by @entity14
and @entity2 was caught by @entity19 off bowling of @entity52
