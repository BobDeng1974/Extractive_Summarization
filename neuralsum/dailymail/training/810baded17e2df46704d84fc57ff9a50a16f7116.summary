@entity3 celebrates a half century at @entity33 in 2012 as @entity0 comes to congratulate him ' everybody is allowed their opinion and i 've had plenty of people in the past saying things about me behind my back , that 's just the way it is			1
' we 're all big enough and strong enough to take it - it motivates you			0
' there are plenty of people who have doubted me in the past and he 's just another one of those little people who doubts me			0
' i 've proven them wrong and i 'll continue to do that - it spurs you on , proving people wrong is a big motivation for me			2
' @entity0 , who is currently doing @entity58 , added : ' there 's no anger			2
so many people doubt you all the time - especially with me being smaller than most			0

' i 've also scored runs in the past and hopefully i 'll do that in the future in international cricket			0
' @entity0 enjoyed an impressive domestic campaign for @entity72 and scored four centuries in his last eight games for the club			1

@entity0 posted this picture on @entity85 on friday showing his effort so far for @entity58 ' i scored a few hundreds at the end of the season and every one was in a different situation			0
' the tempo was different each time and i think we won every game bar one			0
' so i 'm winning games and that 's what i want to do for @entity1 , win games and finish games and put in those match - winning performances			2
' after their seven - match series in @entity24 , @entity1 will play four matches in a @entity103 with @entity104 and @entity105			2
@entity0 batting for @entity1 at @entity33 in 2012 ( left ) and as captain of the @entity107 in the summer the programme allows @entity110 's side time to establish some rhythm before the @entity7 starts in february and @entity0 is determined to show what he can do			1
' there are seven @entity114 for me to impress and show what i can do on and off the field so fingers crossed my name is in that @entity7 squad , ' @entity0 said			2
