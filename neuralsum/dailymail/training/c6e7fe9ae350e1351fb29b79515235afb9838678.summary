' ms @entity1 then blamed her husband @entity26 for the publishing the picture and denied the schoolgirl was dressing as fictional prostitute @entity30			1
@entity25 " @entity8 " was posted on @entity22 by her hsuband the inspiration : @entity1 's daughter wore a similar outfit to that of @entity25 ' character @entity30 but @entity1 later denied this was what she was aping ms @entity1 was apparently worried about what the picture might do for her career because she will be leaving @entity11 's @entity10 and is looking for new opportunities			1

a source told @entity55 : ' as far as @entity1 is concerned , this slip - up came at exactly the wrong time and she is really worried it will affect her career			1
' when @entity1 realised how bad the fall - out was , she was absolutely furious and since then , she and her aide — who she has been with for years — have not been working together			2

@entity1 's spokesman said : ' this story is untrue			2
@entity1 ’s change in @entity88 agencies has nothing to do with any fears over her career , but solely due to her being so devastated that a recent story involving her daughter went out of control and sick comments were being made towards her nine - year - old			2

the @entity11 's @entity10 judge claimed her daughter had dressed up as @entity117 , pictured at the @entity130 with @entity131 in 1991 under fire : it was n't long until followers reacted to her image on @entity22 , which led to it being pulled down @entity137 : one person was quick to target the @entity11 's @entity10 judge with some advice unimpressed : swathes of @entity22 users reacted negatively to the picture published on february 13 ' however my husband thought she looked more like @entity25 , without any thought to any interpretation			1
