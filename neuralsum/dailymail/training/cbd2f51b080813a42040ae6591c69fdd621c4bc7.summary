@entity0 has finally hit @entity2 's controversial foreign aid target , spending more than £ 11.2billion in a year			1
but the news came at the same time that it was revealed that millions of taxpayers ' money is helping to prop up the most corrupt regimes in the world			0
a study by the respected organisation @entity9 ( @entity9 ) reveals that virtually all of the countries with the most serious corruption problems receive lavish aid from @entity0			1
@entity0 sends £ 756,000 a year to the country detailed figures show that we sent funding to all ten of the worst offending nations in 2012			1
between them they received almost £ 500million from the @entity0 taxpayer			1
the prime minister 's goal of devoting 0.7 per cent of @entity0 's income to foreign aid was reached yesterday			1
the target required a 30 per cent increase in the foreign aid budget last year – making it more than the amount set aside for the entire @entity32			2
but the revelations about corruption will fuel concern that much of the aid never reaches those it is intended for			1
@entity39 mp @entity38 said : ' i am sure ministers take what precautions they can , but the situation in many of these countries is so bad that there is no way of knowing where the money ends up			0
' it all comes down to this ridiculous artificial target which means we have to send more and more money every time the economy improves , rather than having a real assessment of need			0
' it is a really dangerous system … it just plays into the hands of corrupt politicians and officials			0
' @entity9 identifies the @entity63 regime as the most corrupt and the @entity64 rates the country as one of the worst governed in the world			2
but in 2012 @entity0 gave the impoverished @entity69 nation £ 86.8million			2
@entity63 is one of a number of countries where aid is channelled through charities and agencies rather than central government in a bid to sidestep corruption			1
but a report in december found many of these organisations were forced to hand over large sums of cash to terrorist group @entity84 in return for protection			0
@entity0 also sent more than £ 200million to @entity87 – rated as the world 's third most corrupt regime			2
the money was given despite a report from the @entity92 two years ago which warned @entity0 aid was at risk of theft , corruption and fraud			1
the watchdog said ' significant improvements ' were needed to protect taxpayers ' money			0
newly formed @entity102 received £ 107million in @entity0 aid , but also has a dismal record for corruption			1
@entity9 ranks the troubled state as the fourth most corrupt			2
in 2012 @entity102 's parliament suspended 75 officials in a scandal involving the theft of £ 2.6billion from the fledgling country			0
@entity111 , one of the fastest risers in @entity9 's annual corruption index , received £ 38.5million in 2012 – a figure thought to have increased dramatically in the past year as the humanitarian crisis worsened			1
earlier this month the government suspended non-lethal military aid to northern @entity111 because of evidence it was falling into the hands of rebel groups linked to @entity122			0
other corrupt nations enjoying @entity0 funding include @entity125 and the @entity126 – 19th and 23rd in the index – which were both handed £ 139million			2
@entity129 , was given £ 197million despite being the 31st most corrupt			0
the @entity130 ( @entity130 ) said it has a zero tolerance approach to corruption and that there were ' rigorous checks to protect taxpayers ' money '			0
a @entity130 spokesman said : ' stopping terrorism , money laundering and tax evasion in the world 's most dangerous places is firmly in our own national interest			0
fighting poverty and corruption will help to end aid dependency more quickly			2
' around £ 750,000 of taxpayers ' money is given to @entity15 through the @entity149 but this goes to aid agencies , not the autocratic regime			0
a @entity149 spokesman said the @entity154 in @entity155 provides ' a very small amount of funding to individual community projects ' for ' vulnerable groups '			0
the huge rise in @entity0 aid is in stark contrast to other developed countries , most of which are slashing their aid programmes			1
@entity167 figures reveal that average aid spending is 0.29 per cent of income – less than half what @entity0 has budgeted .			1
