pub landlady @entity9 , 52 , who had lost her hair following treatment for breast cancer , was left bleeding from a head wound as she tried to eject care worker @entity14 , 19 , over a drunken scuffle at her bar			1
as mrs @entity9 attempted to restore order , @entity17 hit another woman over the head with a beer bottle before attacking the landlady with a friend 's high - heeled shoe , which left her requiring hospital treatment			1
pub landlady @entity9 ( left ) was left bleeding from a head wound after she was attacked with a stiletto heel by @entity14 ( right ) following a drunken fight at her bar the attack occurred after mrs @entity9 , who runs the @entity30 in @entity31 , near @entity32 , @entity33 , had just undergone her first mastectomy as part of her cancer treatment			1
mrs @entity9 has spoken of the ordeal after @entity17 , now 20 , was sentenced to 140 hours unpaid work with an 18 month community order after she pleaded guilty to assault			1
mrs @entity9 said : ' i ca n’t think why @entity14 did this or how she even knew i had cancer before she saw me			1
in a way i feel sorry for her because she is only 20 and now she has that terrible conviction on her record			0
' she was drunk and stupid and its very sad she should have behaved like this			0
everyone in the pub was mortified after the attack and i do n’t see why anyone would do that to anyone - let alone someone who clearly had cancer			1
' what ’s worse was that her mother who is lovely was going round the village asking if my attacker had been caught , before she found out it was @entity14			2
' the incident began in january this year when mrs @entity9 , who was diagnosed with her illness the previous september , was resting upstairs in her living quarters after the latest round of her treatment			1
the attack happened after mrs @entity9 , who runs the @entity30 in @entity31 , near @entity32 , @entity33 , had just undergone her first mastectomy she said : ' i could hear some silly girl screaming outside and a barman came up and said " i think you better come down "			1
he could n’t control it			0
' i found out the noise was coming from a girl around the front who said she had been attacked			2
i found out who the girls were who attacked this person and threw them out			2
' there was lads with them and it erupted in a massive brawl			0
i ’ve never had anything like that since and it had only happened once before			0
it ’s usually a quiet pub. mrs @entity9 said she managed to grab the stiletto after being hit with it and pushed @entity17 away ' i went outside to try and stop them			1
my head was really bad after all the chemo and the steroids i was on for it			2
my youngest son came out and i told him to phone the police			0
' about 20 lads were kicking hell out of each other and all i could hear was girls screaming like banshees			0
we had eldely customers inside and they were scared because of the fight and these girls shouting and wanting to fight			0
' ten years ago i would probably would have taken them on but i was so ill. this girl asked me " who the f * * * i was " and i said it ’s my pub. ' then she said " so you ’re the c * * * with cancer then ? " then she grabbed me			2
' mrs @entity9 told @entity17 to leave and one of the regulars @entity117 , 21 , tried to intervene - but was spat at in the fact			1
mrs @entity9 said : ' @entity14 picked up a @entity121 bottle and smashed it over @entity117 ’s head and you could see the blood pumping out			1
then one of @entity14 ’s friends had fallen over and her shoe had fallen off so she picked it up and hit me on the head with it			1
' i managed to grab it out of her hand and pushed her away but there was a lot of blood - presumably it looked worse because i was bald from the chemo			2
i actually was n’t in pain at the time - the pain came about three days later			2
' and of course the injury from the heel hitting my head was visible because i was bald			0
i just wanted to go back upstairs			0
' @entity17 ran off after police arived but was arrested later			0
she was also ordered by @entity145 magistrates to pay mrs @entity9 and @entity117 £ 300 each as well as costs of £ 210 at a hearing on august 22			1
@entity17 , now 20 , was sentenced to 140 hours unpaid work with an 18 month community order after she pleaded guilty to assault mrs @entity9 added : ' in the weeks before the attack i had lost all my hair			1
my nails fell out , my toenails fell off , my eyelashes fell out			0
' i was sick , i was tired and i could n’t work			0
i ’m still not working properly			0
i feel quite well now , but still very tired i need to have a preventative mastectomy in three weeks time			0
' i might be like this for two years because it was the most aggressive chemo you can have			0
what concerned me the most is people locally told us she was a care worker - what kind of person would do that to someone knowing they were poorly with cancer ? ' @entity17 was unavailable for comment .			2
