coral reefs are often associated with tropical climates and enjoyed by snorkellers for their multi-coloured beauty			2
but it would take a brave holidaymaker indeed to brave the one recently discovered by @entity7 researchers - it 's in the freezing waters of southern @entity9			1
the reef is comprised of what are called living cold - water corals and while there are several species of coral in @entity9 , this is the first time that an actual reef has been found			1
vibrant : cold water coral from the newly discovered reef off the coast of @entity9 the beauty of the depths : this picture of the reef almost cost the research team their camera the newly discovered living reef is located off @entity30 , south of @entity31 , and lies at a depth of 984 yards ( 900 metres ) in a spot with very strong currents , making it difficult to reach			1
this also means that so far little is known about the reef itself and what lives on it			0
the reef was discovered by accident when a @entity7 research vessel needed to take some water samples			1
when the ship sent the measuring instruments down to the depths , they came back up completely smashed			0
the newly discovered living reef is located off @entity30 , south of @entity31 , and lies at a depth of 984 yards ( 900 metres ) coral reef in @entity51 , @entity52 in @entity53			1
this is the kind of image conjured up when most people think of coral reefs fortunately , there were several pieces of broken coral branches on the instrument that showed what was responsible			0
' at first the researchers were swearing and cursing at the smashed equipment and were just about to throw the pieces of coral back into the sea , when luckily they realised what they were holding , ' says phd student @entity71 , of the @entity73			2
deep - water coral , also known as cold - water coral , tend to be found in deeper , darker parts of the oceans than tropical coral , ranging from near the surface to beyond 2,187 yards ( 2,000 metres ) where water temperatures may be as cold as 4 ° c.like tropical coral , they provide habitat to other species			1
they were first discovered by fishermen about 250 years @entity88 world 's largest known deep - water coral complex is the @entity89 in @entity90			1
it lies between 328 and 437 yards ( 300 and 400 metres ) below the waves and is approximately 25 miles long and 1.9 miles wide			0
another @entity7 research vessel returned to the site last autumn to try and lower a camera down onto the reef to explore it close up			1
the coral reef is on the continental shelf itself where it is very steep and where there are strong currents			2
' we got some photos eventually , although we almost lost them at the bottom of the ocean as the camera got stuck fast somewhere down in the depths , ' said mr @entity109			0
' it ’s been known for many years that coral reefs have existed in @entity90 and @entity112 and there is a lot of research on the @entity90 reefs , but not a great deal is known about @entity9			1
in @entity90 , the reefs grow up to 32 yards ( 30 metres ) high and several kilometres long			0
the great @entity90 reefs are over 8,000 years old , which means that they probably started to grow after the ice disappeared after the last ice age			0
the @entity9 reef is probably smaller , and we still do n’t know how old it is , ' he added , expressing the hope that at some point it will be investigated more closely			2
coral reefs are important areas for fish because it provides masses of food and lots of hiding places for fish fry			0
the @entity9 reef is formed from @entity138 stoney corals			2
other species of coral are also found in many parts of the west coast			0
however , they are all ' stand - alone ' corals and do not form reefs .			0

' cold - water ' coral discovered in @entity30 , south of @entity31
it is the first time an entire reef has been discovered in @entity9
it was discovered by @entity7 researchers *purely* by accident
