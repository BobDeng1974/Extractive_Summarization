attorney @entity10 made the request in court today , saying that the defense now has a diagnosis for @entity3 , though he did n't specify what it was			2
the judge said that he finds ' good cause ' to allow the change in plea , will not make his decision until may 28 - three days before a new hearing begins			1
@entity3 had bushy hair and beard at monday 's hearing			2
he did n't speak at all and entered the courtroom with his eyes downcast			0
back in court : accused movie theater gunman @entity3 , is led into the courtroom in this sketch @entity31 : @entity3 ' mother @entity3 , left , is escorted by a member of the defense team as she arrives for monday 's court hearing insanity plea : @entity3 ' attorney @entity10 speaks as @entity3 looks on in this court sketch the not guilty by reason of insanity plea is widely seen as @entity3 ' best - and perhaps his only - hope of avoiding the death penalty			1
but his lawyers have held off until now , fearing a wrinkle in the law could cripple their ability to raise his mental health as a mitigating factor during the sentencing phase			0
two judges have refused to rule on the constitutionality of the law , saying the attorneys ' objections were hypothetical because @entity3 had not pleaded insanity			1
the defense had little choice but to have @entity3 enter the plea and then challenge the law			1
@entity3 ' lawyers announced last week that he would ask to change his plea at monday 's hearing			1
defense : attorney @entity10 made the request in court today , saying that @entity3 ' lawyers now have a diagnosis for @entity3 , though he did n't specify what it was judge : @entity69 district judge @entity68 will rule on the plea change on may 28 prosecutors are seeking the death penalty against @entity3 , who faces more than 160 counts of murder and attempted murder charges			1
they say @entity3 , a former neuroscience graduate student , spent months acquiring weapons and ammunition , scouting a theater in the @entity80 suburb of @entity81 and booby - trapping his apartment			2
then on july 20 , dressed in a police - style helmet and body armor , he opened fire during a packed midnight showing of the @entity90 film ' @entity91 , ' prosecutors say			1
twelve people were killed and another 70 were injured			0
arrest : much of his actions have hinted that an insanity plea might be in the cards , especially after his first court appearance where he seemed out of it no motive has emerged in nearly 10 months of hearings , but @entity3 ' attorneys have repeatedly said their client is mentally ill. he was being treated by a psychiatrist before the attack			1
the insanity plea carries risks for both sides			1
@entity3 will have to submit to a mental evaluation by state - employed doctors , and prosecutors could use the findings against him			2
' it 's literally a life - and - death situation with the government seeking to execute him and the government , the same government , evaluating him with regard to whether he was sane or insane at the time he was in that movie theater , ' said attorney @entity119 , a past president of the @entity120			1
among the risks for prosecutors : they must convince jurors beyond a reasonable doubt that @entity3 was sane			2
if they do n't , state law requires the jury to find him not guilty by reason of insanity			0
' that 's a significant burden on the prosecution , ' @entity119 said			0
if acquitted , @entity3 would be committed to the state mental hospital indefinitely			0
a judge entered a standard not guilty plea on @entity3 ' behalf in march , and he needs court permission to change it			1
@entity119 said it 's a foregone conclusion the judge will accept the new plea to preclude appeals later			2
the mental evaluation could take weeks or months			0
changing their stance : @entity3 , pictured during a march court hearing , has now entered a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity tragic : the shooting at the multiplex left 12 people dead and injured 70 in july 2012 evaluators will interview @entity3 , his friends and family , and if @entity3 permits it , they 'll also speak with mental health professionals who treated him in the past , said dr @entity157 , a professor of psychiatry and adjunct professor of law at @entity160			1
evaluators may give @entity3 standardized personality tests and compare his results to those of people with documented mental illness			0
they will also look for any physical brain problems			0
@entity157 estimates he has conducted around 200 mental evaluations of criminal defendants , including some death penalty cases			0
' all cases are tough , ' he said			0
meticulous planning , as in the scenario prosecutors laid out against @entity3 , does n't necessarily mean a defendant is sane , @entity157 said			0
@entity157 said he helped evaluate @entity176 , who was found not guilty by reason of insanity in the 2009 shooting death of @entity180 in @entity181 , @entity182 , where she was attending college			0
