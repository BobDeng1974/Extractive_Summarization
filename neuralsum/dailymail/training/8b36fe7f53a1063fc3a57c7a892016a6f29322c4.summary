mr @entity1 's dad , @entity98 , told @entity99 had first planned to run the distance but the challenging terrain meant his son had to ditch the idea			1
' he ’s obviously going up and down mountains along the coast because there are n’t any beaches for him to walk down – it ’s all cliffs , ' @entity98 said			0
' at first , we did n’t think he was going to follow through with it but when he was four to six weeks out , it started looking like he was going to do it now			0
