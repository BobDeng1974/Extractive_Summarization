@entity46 ( @entity47 ) as @entity9 's @entity19 was craned back to the garage , the @entity49 driver was then involved in an altercation with a security guard en route back to the pits where he was asked to present his paddock pass despite being dressed in his @entity19 overalls , and wearing his helmet			1
the over-zealous security guard attempted to put his arm across the 29 - year - old asking : ' have you got a pass ' ? to which @entity9 maneuvered his way past and said : ' i 'm a driver ! ' the @entity37 of @entity36 , who was fastest in the opening session , posted the third quickest lap in the afternoon			1
despite their pre-season troubles , @entity5 's @entity38 was fourth , with @entity40 's @entity39 fifth quickest			0
despite his chaotic day , @entity9 was pleased with his progress			1
' i think we basically got a massive foundation in @entity72 and i can build on that in @entity74 and then see where we end up in qualifying , ' said @entity9			2
' it would have been great to have had @entity77 but i got enough running thankfully in @entity72 so i feel quite comfortable with the car			0
' i felt i was really on the back foot already			0
but i got up to the pace quite quickly and found a balance relatively fast as well so i 'm positive			0
' issues : @entity9 's @entity19 is craned away after he stopped on track inside five minutes of the first session @entity85 of attention : fans flock to take pictures of the @entity49 racer after his mercedes ground to a halt on friday @entity38 completed a session - high 40 laps , a triumph of sorts given @entity5 were one of the teams worst affected by testing gremlins throughout the winter			1
the reigning four - time champion sat out the opening 50 minutes of the morning session as his engineers changed the floor on his seemingly troublesome car , yet come the end of the day @entity38 was 0.756secs adrift of @entity107 , with new team - mate @entity41 in close attendance in seventh			1
surprisingly , @entity44 pairing @entity43 and @entity110 were eighth and 12th respectively , despite their pre-season standing as second favourites for the constructors ' crown			0
in trouble : @entity9 parked his mercedes after failing to complete a lap in the day 's opening practice session although the sessions were not as chaos - strewn as perhaps had been anticipated , there are two teams in serious trouble - @entity121 and @entity123			1
the two @entity125 customers managed a combined total of just 17 laps across the four cars			0
hardest hit was @entity121 's @entity129 who completed a solitary installation lap in the morning , only to encounter a fuel system issue that kept his car in the garage for the entire day			1
rookie team - mate @entity134 suffered electrical problems , with the @entity136 only managing one lap per session			1
on track : @entity2 ended the day with the second fastest time as @entity39 takes to the circuit on the slide : despite this off - track incident , @entity38 enjoyed a promising day at the office @entity123 ' pastor @entity144 did not take part in @entity72 after ending first practice with wisps of smoke floating from the cockpit of his car on only his second lap. team - mate @entity153 sat in the garage for the whole of @entity156 and although he made it on track in @entity72 for 12 laps , he ended it in the gravel after a brush with a wall			2
of those that did complete a time , @entity165 's @entity164 was slowest , five seconds down on @entity107 , although he at least ran for 29 laps after only completing four in @entity156			0
lighting up the timesheets : @entity9 was two tenths clear of team - mate @entity2 in the second session			2

@entity9 fastest in second practice session for @entity16 @entity15
