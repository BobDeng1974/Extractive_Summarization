@entity1 executive vice-chairman @entity0 endeavoured to explain on tuesday that the fallen @entity3 club remain a huge draw to players – by highlighting their social media standings			1
@entity0 will be laughed at in some quarters by trying to big up his club by revealing , for example , that new signings @entity10 , @entity12 and @entity13 saw their @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 standings rocket on the day they signed for @entity1 in august			1
with @entity1 out of @entity21 competition for the first time in years this season and currently struggling to impose themselves on this term ’s @entity3 , many fans would rather see some points on the board than listen to stories of social networking increases			0
@entity0 insisted @entity1 's new sponsorship deals will still stand the club in good stead @entity33 is having to re-tune his playing squad after last season 's failure however , @entity0 ’s comments came in a conference call with @entity1 investors to coincide with the release of the club ’s quarterly figures this morning and , as such , were meant to illustrate to shareholders perhaps frustrated by lack of progress on the field that , in global terms , the @entity48 club remain as prominent and high - profile as ever			1
@entity0 said : ' i want to share the impact on players ' profiles around the world by joining @entity1			0
