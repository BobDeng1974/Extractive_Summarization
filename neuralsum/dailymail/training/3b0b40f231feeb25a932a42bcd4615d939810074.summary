by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 18:08 est , 26 april 2012 updated : 19:13 est , 27 april 2012 under pressure : @entity3 leaves his home yesterday morning , where he told reporters he would be releasing all emails and texts to his adviser beleaguered minister @entity3 is to hand over all private texts and emails sent to his shamed special adviser in a bid to save his job			1
by giving them to the @entity17 , the @entity15 said yesterday he believed that his contacts with @entity19 would show that he handled the @entity21 takeover bid by @entity24 's @entity23 empire with ' total integrity '			1
it came as pressure was mounting for a @entity29 inquiry into claims @entity3 broke ministerial rules in his dealings with the @entity24 empire			1
' i will be handing over all my private texts and emails to my special adviser to the @entity17 and i am confident that they will vindicate the position that i handled the @entity21 merger process with total integrity , ' he told reporters outside his @entity43 home yesterday morning			0
a @entity45 sleaze watchdog has this afternoon called for a proper and swift investigation into the case			0
sir @entity48 , chairman of the @entity49 , said the ' obvious ' way for this to be done would be for prime minister @entity52 to call in his independent adviser on the @entity54 , sir @entity55			0
his intervention increases pressure on mr @entity3 and on the prime minister , whose official spokesman has repeatedly made clear that judgments on breaches of the ministerial code is a matter for mr @entity52 only			2
' there can be no doubt that the allegations that have been made about the boundaries and behaviours of ministers , special advisers and the civil service need to be properly investigated , ' sir @entity48 said			0
' it is important for public confidence in the integrity of government and also in fairness to the individuals concerned that this is done - and done reasonably quickly			0
' getting on with it : pm @entity52 has so far resisted an inquiry and left a school in his constituency today with cup cakes the children made for him yesterday @entity87 , the @entity15 ’s most senior civil servant , refused ten times to confirm his version of events when he appeared before mps			2
and as @entity92 continued to stand by mr @entity3 , a @entity94 grandee broke ranks to insist the prime minister ’s independent adviser on ministers ’ interests , sir @entity55 , should look into the affair			1
@entity101 , chairman of the @entity103 public administration committee , backed @entity105 ’s demands for the case to be referred to sir @entity55			2
he said : ‘ there was clearly something of a breakdown of good process and good governance			0
‘ we have a new cabinet secretary and he should demonstrate his independence and advise the prime minister			0
if he thinks there has been a prima facie case of a breach of the @entity54 , it should go straight to the independent adviser			0
’ there were also questions over why the affair has been left solely in the hands of the @entity17 into media ethics			0
@entity105 ’s culture spokesman @entity127 said : ‘ @entity129 ’s inquiry is of huge importance , but it is not in its terms of reference to look into breaches of the @entity54			0
‘ that is the job of the independent adviser and the prime minister will not allow him to look into this			0
’ mr @entity3 is fighting for his political life after evidence emerged of emails and texts between @entity19 , his special adviser , and a @entity24 lobbyist during discussions over whether to allow @entity23 ’s @entity21 takeover bid			1
business secretary @entity146 said mr @entity3 should be able to set out his side of the story ' as soon as possible			2
' but he refused to be drawn on whether he backed the call from mr @entity150 for the case to be referred to sir @entity55			2
threat : @entity24 , who appeared at the @entity17 this week , questioned @entity146 saying he was not a fair judge of the bid ' @entity3 has made it very clear that he wishes to state his side of the story			2
it is absolutely right that he should be given that opportunity as soon as possible , ' he told @entity160 ’s @entity161			0
mr @entity146 also insisted he dealt with the @entity21 takeover bid ' fairly and properly ' while it was his responsibility			0
the case was passed to mr @entity3 in 2010 after mr @entity146 was secretly recorded telling reporters he had ' declared war ' on company chairman @entity24			1
mr @entity24 told the @entity17 on thursday that he expected mr @entity3 to be a ' fairer ' judge of the bid than the business secretary			1
mr @entity146 retorted : ' as far as my own role in that whole case is concerned , i dealt with that case fairly and properly and when i go before the @entity17 , i will take the inquiry step by step through the process and explain exactly what happened and the public will then be fully aware of it			2
' on thursday night , @entity181 deputy leader @entity150 joined calls for an inquiry into whether the @entity15 breached the ministerial code of conduct			1
the senior figure said he could not understand why prime minister @entity52 had ruled out referring the controversy over the actions of mr @entity3 ’s special adviser to a regulator			1
deputy prime minister @entity191 has backed the no 10 stance but mr @entity150 questioned why there should not also be an probe by sir @entity195			2
pressure : text messages sent between @entity23 lobbyist @entity198 , left , and @entity3 were revealed , mounting pressure on pm @entity52 to launch an inquiry ' what i can not understand is why the matter of the ministerial code of conduct , which is to do with do you take responsibility for your special adviser , is not something the prime minister should immediately refer to the person who has been given the job of doing that , sir @entity200 , ' he told @entity215 ’s @entity214			1
asked whether @entity52 agreed with mr @entity150 that an inquiry into potential breaches of the ministerial code was needed , the prime minister 's official spokesman said : ' no. the prime minister made very clear on wednesday that he has full confidence in the way @entity3 handled the @entity21 bid			1
' responding to the announcement that mr @entity3 plans to hand over emails and text messages relating to the @entity21 bid to @entity129 , the spokesman said it was for the @entity15 to prepare and present his own submission			1
' incredible ' : labour leader @entity232 said it was ' incredible ' mr @entity3 was still @entity15 a spokesman for mr @entity191 said : ' @entity3 has made his statement to @entity236 and will provide more information to the @entity17			1
that process should be allowed to happen			0
' @entity105 claim the @entity54 was breached three times as mr @entity3 was supposed to be acting in a ‘ quasi-judicial ’ role determining whether or not to allow the £ 8billion bid			2
mr @entity19 resigned on wednesday insisting his contacts with @entity23 lobbyist @entity198 went far beyond what mr @entity3 had authorised			1
the @entity15 is confident that emails and texts between himself and mr @entity19 demonstrate he did nothing wrong , and is ready to hand them over to the @entity17 as he tries to clear his name			2
but there was confusion yesterday over his assertion that the senior civil servant at the @entity253 authorised mr @entity19 to act as a ‘ point man ’ with the @entity24 empire			1
as he appeared before the public accounts committee , mr @entity87 repeatedly refused to confirm that version of events			0
later the department issued a statement saying he had not felt it appropriate to provide further information ahead of its evidence to the @entity17			0
a spokesman added : ‘ the permanent secretary was aware that @entity19 was among a small number of individuals in the department who were in contact with @entity23 and was content with that arrangement			0
‘ the content and extent of his contact was done without authorisation , and were contrary to the clear requirements set out by @entity3 and the permanent secretary			0
’ labour leader @entity232 said it was ‘ incredible ’ that mr @entity3 was still @entity15 and accused mr @entity52 of using him as a ‘ firewall ’			1
he said : ‘ why is @entity3 still in his job ? because @entity52 has questions to answer , and @entity3 is , if you like , acting as a firewall , and if he goes the questions will then move to @entity52 ’s conversations with @entity288 , with @entity289 and others			0
’ while former @entity105 deputy leader @entity291 this morning backed mr @entity232 and told the today programme : ' @entity3 must answer in @entity236 not to the @entity17			1
' but former @entity94 leader @entity293 responded in the radio debate that mr @entity3 will now be called early by @entity129 and should then be given the chance to explain himself .			1

releasing his contacts with his adviser will prove he broke no rules in dealing with @entity24 empire , he said
but @entity94 grandee @entity101 says a probe into the @entity15 's conduct should be launched now
@entity181 deputy leader @entity150 says he ' can not understand ' the @entity307 's *decision* not to hold an inquiry
@entity307 responds by *reaffirming* his confidence in mr @entity3
