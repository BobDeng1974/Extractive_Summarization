yesterday the jury was played the tapes which reveal @entity3 fiercely barracking her former husband , insulting his new partner and brow - beating him over the points			2
she repeatedly tried to provoke @entity4 into confirming he committed the crime , but he was wary of what she was up to and resolutely denied it , telling her not to speak to the @entity218			2
at times in the phone calls played to the court , the former energy secretary repeatedly fends off his wife as she rants over his denials , but on other occasions he is more conciliatory			0
at one point he tells her : ‘ can i suggest , if you want to stop journalists door - stepping you , you stop telling ridiculous stories to the @entity218 ? ’ @entity3 also dishonestly denies having any involvement in the @entity268 rumours in a bid to find some common ground between them			2

she added : ‘ it ’s one of the things that ’s always worried me when you made me take them in the first instance			0
