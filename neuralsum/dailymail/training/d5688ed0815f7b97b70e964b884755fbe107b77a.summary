by @entity0 published : 06:33 est , 26 july 2013 updated : 20:05 est , 26 july 2013 a prolific sperm donor who advertised himself for ‘ breeding parties ’ has been ordered to pay £ 300,000 after fathering a child with a married client during a fling			1
the man , who claims to have sired 30 children , was ruled the legal parent of a two - year - old boy conceived after an affair			1
his claim that conception was the result of artificial insemination rather than ‘ ordinary sex ’ was rejected by the court , which heard he used his fertility to get women into bed			2
paying the price : a sperm donor who has fathered more than 30 children must pay £ 300,000 legal costs after an affair with a client , the high court found a judge heard that his activity on an unofficial donation website was designed ‘ to meet his own sexual needs ’			1
the man – known only as mr @entity35 – had also advertised online for a ‘ breeding party – a male - dominated orgy designed to get a woman pregnant ’			1
at @entity41 ’s @entity40 , mr justice @entity39 ruled that mr @entity35 faces £ 300,000 in legal costs as well as paying for the child ’s upkeep			1
he said the donor and the client – referred to as mrs m – had an ‘ intense extramarital affair ’ in 2010 after they met through a website			2
the woman had been told the chances of having a baby were ‘ pretty grim ’ because her husband had had a vasectomy and was 30 years older			2
in march 2010 , they met the donor in a cafe , but the husband was not happy with the plans and left			0
ruling : justice @entity39 called the man and woman ' untruthful , devious and manipulative ' but agreed her pregnancy was as a result of them becoming lovers however , three months later mrs m spent a weekend at mr f ’s flat , where she claimed they had sex			1
she continued to see him and , according to her , they had sex on a number of occasions			2
her husband – who she divorced in february last year – had been ‘ out of his depth and powerless ’ as the fling with mr f developed , the court heard			2
the matter came to court when mrs m claimed their meetings involved ‘ 15 days of sex ’ , while mr @entity35 said they involved ‘ 15 donations by artificial insemination ’			1
the judge said : ‘ i accept that mr @entity35 first became involved in licensed donation altruistically and even now , i do not discount a residual element of altruism in his make - up or forget that there are many much - wanted children alive today as a result of his efforts			1
‘ however , i am clear that in relation to his website activity his mainspring has been to meet his own needs , at least at a sexual level			0
’ mr @entity35 was also said to have ‘ engaged in sexual activity ’ with both members of a lesbia pair who had approached him via the website			1
but his prolific sexual activity with recipients amounted to a ‘ brazen flouting ’ of the rules of the website , said the judge			0
mr @entity35 was ‘ bound in his professional life by a clear code of ethics ’ , which made the risks he took ‘ the more surprising ’ , he said			1
‘ in one relevant period of two to three months alone , he was on his own account having sex with three women and providing artificial insemination to two others , ’ added the judge			2
‘ most of these contacts had to be kept secret from the other women involved			0
‘ the sheer logistical challenge alongside his professional life will have been a burden that he would have been likely to have laid down if he had not been driven on by some degree of compulsion			0
’ the judge said the case had revealed problems in controlling the ‘ informal trade ’ in fertility treatment			0
those seeking to conceive may be in a ‘ vulnerable state and not all donors are motivated by altruism ’ , he claimed			0
career : the man was a licensed sperm donor who apparently used his fertility to get women into bed ‘ some births follow treatment at licensed clinics and others originate from informal arrangements , ’ said the judge			0
‘ either way , those involved must often be confronted by profound feelings and powerful forces			0
‘ these include , relevantly to this case , a yearning for children , a need for friendship and a hunger for sex , forces that can overpower and defeat routine social conventions			0
’ he said the trade in informal donations – which is legal – is not regulated ‘ in any meaningful way ’			0
the website in the case – which was not named – charges high fees while projecting a ‘ rose - tinted account of successful , problem - free conception ’ , he said			0
its cardinal rule was ‘ artificial insemination only ’ , but mr @entity35 ’s public profile on the site was said to openly advertise him as offering ‘ artificial insemination and natural intercourse ’ .			1

the man - mr @entity35 - claimed that pregnancy was not a result of sex
but @entity40 ruled he had affair with woman who was originally a client
mr @entity35 even organised ' breeding party orgy ' online to make babies
must pay £ 300,000 costs to her and £ *13,000* to her scorned ex-husband
*paternity* costs for his *toddler* *daughter* will be *decided* at a later hearing
