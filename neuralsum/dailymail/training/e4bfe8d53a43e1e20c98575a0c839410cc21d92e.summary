pupils starting gcse courses this month will sit straight exams at the end of two years instead , but one more year group will face the flawed exams first			0
he admitted that this year 's gcse students had been treated unfairly mr @entity1 also said gcses could be scrapped by 2015 in favour of new exams modelled on o - levels , designed for the ' overwhelming majority ' , with some pupils sitting them at 17 or 18 instead of 16			1
but he insisted he was unable to step in to order the regrading of thousands of exam papers by pupils caught up in this year 's trouble with gcse @entity30			1
@entity32 , the exams watchdog , admitted in a report last week that grade boundaries were raised for the summer exams			0

the @entity1 was pressed on the gcse grading fiasco in the @entity47 yesterday and during a series of interviews			2
