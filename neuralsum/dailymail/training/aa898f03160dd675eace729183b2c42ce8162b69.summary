by @entity0 published : 07:12 est , 5 august 2013 updated : 19:39 est , 5 august 2013 mothers who stay at home with their children have made a ‘ lifestyle choice ’ and can expect no help with their childcare costs , @entity1 declared yesterday			1
the chancellor enraged campaigners by unveiling a plan to hand up to £ 1,200 a child to families where both parents work – even if they bring home as much as £ 300,000 between them			1
the scheme will be available to up to 2.5million families and will allow them to claim back 20 per cent of childcare costs			0
chancellor @entity1 left @entity21 ( left ) unimpressed during his visit to a nursery in @entity24 as he unveiled plans for cheaper childcare with the cost limit set at £ 6,000 a year per child , the scheme would be worth up to £ 2,400 for a family of four			1
the 1.2million parents who stay at home with their children will not get a penny			1
mr @entity1 said he had ‘ huge respect ’ for stay - at - home mothers and pointed out that the government will ‘ help ’ them with a married couples tax break in november			1
but he was accused of being patronising by saying those who put their children first had simply made a ‘ lifestyle choice ’			1
he told @entity40 ’s @entity41 : ‘ it will help those on tight family budgets who have to weigh up the cost of childcare when they are making difficult lifestyle decisions			2
‘ this is help for formal childcare			0
obviously it ’s not for stay - at - home mothers			1
' i have huge regard for mothers who want to stay at home and look after their children , that ’s their lifestyle choice			1
‘ i want to help those families too , i ’m not trying to be exclusive			0
’ but @entity59 , a mother who left her job as barrister to raise her two children , said : ‘ saying stay - at - home mothers have made a lifestyle choice is pejorative and patronising			1
‘ they are contributing to the economy , to society , to everything			0
staying at home is not a luxury , it ’s not a hobby			2
women who chose to stay at home make huge sacrifices			2
' the married tax allowance is something we have been calling for but their version is pretty pathetic when compared to the childcare vouchers			2
’ she accused the government of ‘ social engineering ’ and claimed ministers ‘ think that stay at home mothers are not conforming to what they want ’			1
eye - popping : critics have slammed the plans to offer taxpayer help to families earning up to £ 300,000 a year mr @entity1 faced criticism from mothers ’ groups because an existing , less generous , system of free childcare , which is due to be frozen from 2015 , helps families with children as old as 16			1
@entity102 , of parenting website @entity100 , said : ‘ in an ideal world you ’d want help with childcare costs up until the time you stop needing childcare for your kids – which is more like 15 than five			0
’ the chancellor defended the decision as the least bureaucratic way to implement the policy			2
he said : ‘ the administratively simple way to do that is to align it to one of the tax bands , one of the tax thresholds and at £ 150,000 there ’s a 45p tax rate kicks in			1
‘ we could either have done it at £ 150,000 or we could have done it at just over £ 40,000 which is when the 40p tax rate kicks in and i took the view that i did n’t want to stop families earning £ 42,000 getting the help for tax - free childcare			1
’ but @entity132 , secretary of mothers at @entity133 , pointed out mr @entity1 has removed child benefit from families where just one parent earns more than £ 60,000			1
she said single - earner families have suffered a ‘ series of blows ’			2
@entity142 mp @entity141 said : ‘ i want to see more support directed at families where one partner , one spouse , chooses to stay at home			1
’ the handouts will be available from september 2015 to parents with children aged five and under			2
what childcare provision is available now ? parents can surrender up to £ 2,915 a year from their gross salary which the employer will pay directly into the voucher account of a recognised childcare provider			1
if they sacrifice this level of salary , basic rate taxpayers can make tax and national insurance savings of £ 933			2
the @entity164 scheme is not available to the self - employed or to those whose employers have not signed up			2
both parents can claim separately , doubling the amount of tax they can save			2
the voucher scheme closes in september 2015 although those already in it can keep claiming			2
what ’s the new plan ? parents will receive a tax break worth 20 per cent of their childcare costs , per child , up to £ 6,000			1
that means they will receive £ 1,200 of free childcare for each of their children			0
there is no limit on the number of children who can be covered			0
when the scheme is introduced in september 2015 it will apply to all children under 5			0
by 2020 it will apply to all children under 12			0
how will it work ? to receive tax - free childcare , a working family will set up a voucher account with a government - approved provider			2
the family will pay money into their tax - free childcare voucher account			2
the government will top up the family ’s payment at a rate of 20p for every 80p the family pays in			0
the provider will then issue a voucher equal to the value of both these contributions			0
the family can then use this voucher to pay a qualifying provider for childcare			0
who will qualify ? the 2.5million families where both parents are in paid work and where neither is earning more than £ 150,000 a year			1
in addition , anyone on carer ’s allowance will be included , as well as parents who are on either maternity or paternity pay			0
the @entity225 claims 1.2million families will be better off moving to the new scheme and 1million families who could n’t get @entity164 will be able to access the new scheme			0
what does ‘ working ’ mean ? the government has asked for views on who precisely should qualify			0
it could be someone working a minimum of 16 hours a week , or someone working two days a week			0
in favour of vouchers : @entity242 with son @entity243 , four @entity244 and @entity242 believe the childcare vouchers are ‘ very important ’			0
mr @entity247 , 55 , a civil engineer , and his wife , 48 , a marketing consultant , from @entity250 in @entity251 , have both returned to work since the birth of their son @entity243 four years ago			0
their combined income is £ 150,000 and since @entity243 turned three they have received 15 hours of free childcare per week , with £ 240 in childcare vouchers each month			1
the help with childcare costs mean the money the couple would have spent on childcare can be put aside to pay for private school fees			0
mr @entity247 said : ‘ both of us really appreciate the childcare help because it pays for nursery and after school clubs for @entity243			0
‘ i think policies like this are very important for parents as working is really worthwhile			0
it ’s an idea i fully support			0
’ ' real downer ' : the @entity274 with daughters @entity275 and @entity277 @entity278 and @entity279 say the government ’s voucher system is another ‘ kick ’ for mothers who choose to look after their children			1
mrs @entity279 , 40 , gave up her job as an assistant head teacher seven years ago when her daughter @entity275 was born , and has stayed at home to look after their two - year - old daughter @entity277			1
the family felt penalised when they lost out on £ 2,000 a year in child benefit because mr @entity295 ’s business brought in more than £ 50,000 a year			1
they now stand to miss out on a further £ 1,200 because mrs @entity279 no longer works			0
mr @entity295 , 43 , who runs @entity298 coffee roaster in @entity299 , said he did not understand why the @entity300 were undermining stay - at - home mothers			1
he said : ‘ this government is using fiscal policy to penalise stay - at - home mothers			1
it seems to have a real downer on them			0
‘ it ’s just kick after kick for people like my wife who work hard for the good of their family			0

*online* voucher system expected to benefit about 2.5m households
even two parents who earn £ 150,000 a year each will get payments
but plan has been criticised as an ' insult ' to stay - at - home mothers
chancellor says *non-working* mums have made a ' lifestyle ' choice
vouchers available to both parents earning up to £ 150,000 each
critics brand policy ' *inconsistent* ' with other cuts for those earning £ 50,000
@entity142 mp @entity141 says ' clumsy ' policy gives the rich ' *unnecessary* ' help
