congressional republicans , led by @entity2 chair @entity1 , are planning another @entity4 coal - raking exercise for wednesday , hauling the tax agency 's commissioner in for a hearing about the nearly year - old tea party targeting scandal			1
committee staff say the @entity12 @entity11 and the rest of the @entity15 administration have n't shown them any sign that they 're investigating corruption in the awarding of income tax exemptions to nonprofit groups			1
an aide to one @entity23 committee member said monday that the @entity24 and the @entity25 were already dangerously close to causing a constitutional crisis			2
' they 've blown off the subpoenas , ' the aide said , referring to legal demands the committee issued to the @entity4 on august 2 and february 14			2
' if the @entity11 keeps dragging its heels too , and can just get away with it , why do we have an oversight committee in the first place ? it 's like the @entity24 has never heard of the separation of powers			0
but @entity61 himself is the official responsible for enforcing the contempt finding , rendering him essentially outside the reach of @entity69			2
and despite the @entity24 's assurance that the @entity11 is investigating the most politically fraught @entity4 scandal since the @entity73 administration , president @entity15 said during a @entity56 sunday interview that he was already sure there was ' not even a smidgen of corruption ' to be found – suggesting that he is n't reserving judgment until an investigation has concluded			1
in june 2013 , @entity24 press secretary @entity79 told reporters that the president thought political targeting by @entity4 officials was ' a problem			2
' @entity1 , a @entity51 @entity23 , is calling @entity4 top dog @entity42 to testify wednesday about what his agency has done to clean house			1
beginning in early 2010 , @entity4 officials routinely held up tax - exempt applications from conservative organizations , including ' tea party ' - named groups , whose positions differed from the president 's			1
some groups waited more than three years for their approvals , while politically liberal groups were fast - tracked			1
foot - dragging ? attorney general @entity61 has promised to investigate the @entity4 's actions , but @entity2 @entity23 say the @entity11 wo n't show any evidence it 's actually happening @entity15 sacked the then - acting commissioner , @entity99 , promising in the @entity100 that ' we will work with @entity69 as it performs its oversight role			1
and our administration has to make sure that we are working hand in hand with @entity69 to get this thing fixed			2
' ' @entity69 , @entity107 and @entity23 , owe it to the @entity12 people to treat that authority with the responsibility it deserves , ' he insisted , ' and in a way that does n’t smack of politics or partisan agendas			2
... the good news is it ’s fixable , and it ’s in everyone ’s best interest to work together to fix it			0
' the scandal has galvanized disparate parts of the @entity23 , with libertarian - leaning sen. @entity123 and others firing up more traditionally conservative constituencies with red - meat , @entity127 messages @entity15 nominated @entity42 to take the place of @entity130 , another interim commissioner , in august			1
he was confirmed during the week before @entity131			0
' we all hoped the new commissioner would be independent and at least make a move to toss out some of the bad apples , ' @entity133 's source said			0
' but this is looking like more of the same			0
the committee is doing all it can , but if these guys refuse to obey the law there 's not much anyone can do			0
' the @entity4 's complicity in the scandal that hamstrung hundreds of small tea party - affiliated groups exploded in may 2013 when @entity151 , then in charge of the agency 's ' @entity149 , answered a self - planted question about it during a professional conference			1
since then , she has refused twice to answer questions before the @entity2 , citing her @entity155 right against self - incrimination			2
the @entity4 promised nearly three weeks ago that it will turn over all of @entity151 's emails during the @entity15 administration to the @entity159 – the @entity2 expects to share in the bounty of disclosures – but no documents have shown up on @entity163			1
@entity1 and other @entity23 committee leaders released a report this month alleging that @entity151 ' believed the political participation of tax - exempt organizations harmed @entity107 candidates , she believed something needed to be done , and she directed action from her unit at the @entity4			1
' she was also involved , they wrote , ' in an " off - plan " effort to write new regulations in a manner that intentionally sought to undermine an existing framework for transparency , ' and then ' engaged in efforts to cover it up ' by publicly denying that the @entity4 was trying to change its evaluation criteria			0
still a target : @entity151 , who helmed the @entity4 's tax - exempt application office while right - wing groups were singled out for special scrutiny and held back for years at a time , has refused twice to answer questions before @entity69 the net effect of the proposed new regulations – an effort described in @entity4 emails as being developed ' off - plan ' and away from public view – would be to codify the procedures that @entity151 put into place , in a way that @entity23 congressional insiders say will permanently make it harder for conservatives to participate in the political process			1
' instead of fixing a clear form of discrimination , they 're trying to write it into stone , ' a second @entity23 aide said monday			0
' that 's why so many people have complained about it			0
' more than 143,000 comments were logged in response to the @entity4 's regulatory proposal , a historic number that 's second only to the @entity15 administration 's requirement under the @entity215 that all qualifying insurance plans must include coverage for contraceptives			1
committee staff said monday on background that the @entity4 has failed to turn over any requested documents about the proposed regulation			0
' you watch on wednesday , ' the second staffer predicted : ' @entity42 is going to bob and weave , and committee @entity227 [ ocrat ] s are going to try and change the subject over and over again			0
' ' this is probably going nowhere , again			0
unless the chairman has some new ammunition			0
i do n't know that he does			0
