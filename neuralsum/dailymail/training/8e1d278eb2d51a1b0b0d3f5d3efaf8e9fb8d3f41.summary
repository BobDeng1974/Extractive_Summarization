there are ways of quitting a job you hate ... and then there are ways of quitting a job you hate			1
and this is most certainly the latter			2
when video editor @entity8 decided she wanted to leave @entity10 animator @entity11 she did n't pop into her boss 's office to have a quiet word			1
instead , she posted a film on @entity16 of herself dancing around the open - plan workspace to @entity19 's hit single gone with subtitles explaining her grievances in detail			1
dead of night : the video begins with miss @entity8 setting up a camera in her company 's office at 4.30am dancing time : it then cuts to a shot of her dancing to the music of @entity19 's hit gone backhanded compliment : miss @entity8 says her boss is a ' brilliant writer ' and her ' respect for him is boundless ' and as if that were not enough , she also penned a 1,500 - word blog outlining her reasons , which she called @entity42 is @entity43 ( to me )			1
she writes : ' i work for an awesome company that produces news videos			2
' for almost two years i 've sacrificed my time , energy and relationships for this job , and my boss only cares about quantity and how many views each video gets			1
gripe : tactfully she never names the company for which she worked but pulls few punches in her reasons for wanting out blogged down : and as if the video were not enough , she also penned a 1,500 - word blog outlining her reasons , which she called @entity42 is @entity43 ( to me ) ' so i thought i 'd make one of my own to focus on the content instead of worry about the views			1
' oh , and to let my boss know i quit			2
' on her blog , miss @entity8 , who is from @entity67 , explains further : ' i got a job [ ... ] for an animation company where i was free to make jokes and put my personality into my writing			1
i loved it ! i found the perfect combination between comedy and journalism			2
i was having my cake , eating it and going in for seconds			0
' i dropped everything for work			0
i spent hours in the office perfecting my headlines , my voice overs , my stories			1
ironic ? since posting it online two days ago , her video has had more than 300,000 views ' i 'm gone ' : the video ends with her switching off the light and leaving the office ' but as the workload increased , i found i could no longer keep up			1
i came in earlier , i stayed later , i worked on weekends			0
scared i was nâ€™t pulling my weight , i went to my boss and told him how i felt			0
' " make deadlines , not art , " was his response			0
' after i admitted that i could not hit the deadlines needed to put out our long - form , satirical news pieces , i was moved to our serious stories			0
' but she says she did n't find that fulfilling and decided to leave for a different career			0
she adds : ' running away from something is never the solution			0
unless your problem is a mugger			0
go ! now ! ' but for this particular problem , the solution is rolling up your sleeves , sticking your hands in the motherboard and jostling the wires until things fall into place			0
