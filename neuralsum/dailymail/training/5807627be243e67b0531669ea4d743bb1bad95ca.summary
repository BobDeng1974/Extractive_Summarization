women are increasingly putting their husband 's career before their own , a controversial new study of @entity2 graduates has found			1
it canvassed over 25,000 male and female students , and found 40 percent of @entity8 and boomer women said their spouses ' careers took priority over theirs			1
they researchers also said only about 20 percent of them had planned on their careers taking a back seat when they graduated			0
. the team also say that in most cases , children were not the cause of the lapsed careers			0
the majority of women said they assumed they would have egalitarian marriages in which both spouses ' careers were taken equally seriously			2
researchers surveyed more than 25,000 @entity2 graduates altogether			1
they reported on @entity28 ( ages 49 – 67 ) , @entity8 ( ages 32 – 48 ) , and @entity31 ( ages 26 – 31 ) , also known as @entity31 they concluded that while women were well intentioned when they graduated , they ultimately ended up being held back by their partners			2
the new study of @entity2 graduates from @entity2 's @entity38 and @entity39 and @entity41 sociologist @entity40 interviewed 25,000 men and women who graduated from @entity2 over the past several decades			1
' in the end , we found not just achievement and satisfaction gaps between men and women , but a real gap between what women expect as they look ahead to their careers and where they ultimately land , ' they wrote			0
' the men and women who graduate from @entity2 set out with much in common — mbas , high ambitions , and preparation for leadership			1
' perhaps it 's time for more - candid conversations — at home , at work , and on campus — about how and why their paths unfold so differently			0
' the researchers found male graduates were much more likely to be in senior management positions and have more responsibility and more direct reports than their female peers			0
' setting aside those measures of success , since not everyone aspires to them , we found that women are less satisfied with their careers			1
the gap between men ’s and women ’s advancement to senior positions has endured , despite increasing numbers of women with the credentials and the experience to assume top roles across industries and institutions and despite the efforts of many organizations to develop their high - potential female employees			0
in the business world , women make up 5 % of @entity97 , and only a handful of them are women of color			1
the gap is narrower but still significant in professional service firms , where 20 % of ceos are women			2
and despite much interest in and attention to women on boards , women hold fewer than 20 % of board seats at @entity112 companies , and their representation has increased only incrementally in recent years			2
even fewer women of color ( below 5 % ) occupy source : catalyst ' whereas about 50 % to 60 % of men across the three generations told us they were ' extremely satisfied ' or ' very satisfied ' with their experiences of meaningful work , professional accomplishments , opportunities for career growth , and compatibility of work and personal life , only 40 % to 50 % of women were similarly satisfied on the same dimensions			1
' when they graduated , more than half of male hbs grads said they expected their careers would take precedence over their partners '			0
only 7 percent of gen @entity8 women and 3 percent of baby boomer women said they expected their careers to take precedence			0
researchers surveyed more than 25,000 @entity2 graduates altogether			1
' close to three - quarters of @entity8 and @entity144 men reported that their careers had indeed taken precedence — more than had originally expected this arrangement , the researchers wrote			0
' meanwhile , many women ’s expectations for career equality were disappointed			2
' though majorities of @entity8 and @entity144 women reported that they were in egalitarian or progressive partnerships , the remainder found that their careers took lower priority			0
' that figure — 40 % — is almost double the proportion who left @entity2 expecting a traditional arrangement			1
' more than 70 percent of @entity8 and boomer men say their careers are more important than their wives .			0
