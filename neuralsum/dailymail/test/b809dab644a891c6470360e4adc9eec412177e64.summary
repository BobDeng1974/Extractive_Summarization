@entity0 takes a look at 10 things we have learned from an entertaining weekend of @entity5 fixtures , as well as intriguing statistics from the @entity7			0
@entity8 might consider bringing in referee @entity9 to give his players some lessons on keeping up with play			1
the official sprinted more than half the length of the field to be 10 yards from @entity16 when he completed his hat - trick for @entity18 in the 4 - 1 demolition of @entity20			1
top marks for him – but none at all for @entity24 who was goal side of @entity16 before the breakaway began , yet way behind the official when the goal went in			1
@entity30 and @entity31 were also both stood nearer their own goal than the ref when @entity36 ’s clearance began the move , but nowhere to be seen when the ball hit the net			2
@entity16 raced past @entity24 before scoring his hat - trick goal against @entity20 @entity24 was goal side of @entity16 before the @entity18 winger went on to score his third goal referee @entity9 sprinted past @entity20 midfielder @entity24 during @entity16 's impessive run @entity16 starred in @entity18 's emphatic 4 - 1 win over @entity20 at the @entity45 2			1
@entity46 has responded to the challenge of fighting @entity48 for his place in @entity51 ’s defence and looks to be winning the battle			1
when it got tough for the @entity5 leaders at @entity57 it was @entity46 who responded best to ensure @entity58 ’ late striker was a winner			1
@entity46 made 15 clearances – as many as the rest of @entity51 ’s back four put together – and won 13 of 15 duels for the ball			1
@entity46 has managed to win back his starting spot alongside @entity67 after his brief absence @entity51 starlet @entity48 had deputised for @entity46 during the @entity71 international 's stint on the sidelines 3			1
@entity74 ’s decision to axe goalkeeper @entity75 after fining him for smoking in the showers at @entity77 has proved a pivotal point of @entity80 ’s season			1
the 1 - 0 victory at @entity82 was the sixth clean sheet the @entity84 had kept in 12 @entity5 games since @entity86 took over – one more than they ’d achieved in the previous 20			2
more important , @entity80 have won 11 of those matches to move from sixth in the table to second			2
@entity80 goalkeeper @entity86 has kept six clean sheets since replacing @entity75 4			1
@entity91 ’s recovery from a hamstring injury was supposed to be the boost @entity94 needed towards the end of the season but instead has marked the collapse of their campaign			1
@entity94 were in the middle of a 14 - game unbeaten run when their skipper came back to face title rivals @entity80 at the end of january – a game they lost 2 - 0			1
the 4 - 2 collapse at @entity107 made it 14 matches since then , of which @entity94 have lost eight			1
@entity111 star @entity91 has missed only one of them – a 2 - 0 win over @entity115 which saw one of only three clean sheets			1
@entity94 captain @entity91 has struggled for form during the past few weeks 5			1
@entity120 ’s ' @entity119 day ' provided a nostalgic trip back in time , with @entity120 ’s players wearing replica kit from the 1968 fa cup final and shirts numbered from two to 11 ( goalkeeper @entity126 wore no number , like @entity128 back then )			1
but there was one aspect that was completely out of keeping with the flashback to football ’s black and white days – every one of @entity120 ’s players wore coloured boots			0
four red pairs , two orange , two white , one blue , one yellow – and captain @entity139 ’s purplish pinky colour made up the modern footwear rainbow			0
@entity120 captain @entity139 wore multicoloured boots on ' @entity119 day ' at the @entity143 6			0
when @entity145 was sacked in early february , @entity144 had scored just 15 goals in 28 matches in all competitions			0
it ’s taken @entity150 just 10 games to overtake that total – @entity154 ’s winner at @entity155 was the 16th scored since his appointment			0
@entity144 striker @entity154 has returned to form since @entity150 's arrival at @entity159 7			2
@entity160 backed up manager @entity162 ’s faith by tucking away the penalty against @entity164 that put @entity77 on the path to a 2 - 0 win			2
@entity162 had to shout orders from the bench to let the @entity71 youngster take the kick as @entity172 striker @entity171 picked up the ball to head for the spot first			2
you could n’t blame @entity171 for wanting to jump the queue – @entity177 had never scored a @entity5 goal in 68 previous appearances for the @entity77 , and none of his four @entity71 under 21 strikes had come from the penalty spot			2
@entity77 manager @entity162 ensured @entity160 took penalty ahead of @entity171 8			0
reading midfielder @entity186 has timed his return to fitness perfectly after 16 horrible months recovering from a cruciate knee ligament operation			0
the @entity192 - born product of the @entity193 ’ youth academy got through 73 minutes of the 0 - 0 draw with @entity195 in his first start for 16 months – just in time to be available for saturday ’s @entity197 semi-final against @entity80			2
he has a good chance of playing at @entity200 after helping make the defence more solid			0
it was the first time @entity204 ’s side had kept a clean sheet in their last nine @entity207 games			0
@entity193 's @entity186 made his first start for 16 months against @entity195 on saturday afternoon 9			0
taking 50 points is normally a guarantee of safety from relegation in @entity212 – it ’s been enough to stay up for all but one of the last nine years ( @entity215 had 50 but went down on goal difference in 2010 ) this season looks like being different , though , after @entity219 ’s draw with @entity220 left both clubs plus @entity222 on 47 points with four games still to play			0
that means sleepless nights for @entity222 boss @entity227 who ’ll have bad memories of going down from the @entity207 with @entity230 despite finishing on 51 points			0
@entity222 are in danger of dropping down to @entity233 despite ascertaining 47 points in 41 games 10			0
@entity236 midfielder @entity235 has the curious middle name of @entity238 – and he ’s certainly all the fashion when it comes to taking set - pieces			0
the 22 - year - old is on his third loan of the season from @entity245 because @entity247 boss @entity246 admires his pinpoint accuracy with a dead ball			0
he showed why by setting up goals from both a corner and free - kick in a 2 - 1 win over @entity254 that put @entity236 back into the @entity233 play - off places			2
@entity236 midfielder @entity235 has taken @entity233 by storm since being loaned out by @entity245			0

@entity16 raced past @entity24 to claim his hat - trick
referee @entity9 was closer to @entity16 than @entity24 for final goal
@entity46 has won back his starting spot after brief spell on sidelines
@entity91 failed to impress in @entity94 's defeat by @entity267
@entity74 's decision to drop @entity75 has been justified
