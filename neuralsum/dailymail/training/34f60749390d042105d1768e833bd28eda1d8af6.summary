by @entity0 @entity2 scientists are seeking to unlock the secrets of 3,500 year old @entity5 graves where couples are buried together in a seemingly loving embrace - amid suspicions of a macabre explanation			1
these images show ancient burials in @entity12 village in @entity13 where experts have examined some 600 tombs			1
dozens contain the bones of couples , facing each other , some with male and female skeletons , their hands held together seemingly for eternity			1
@entity2 scientists have uncovered the bones of dozens of couples buried facing each other in @entity12 village in @entity13 ' archeologists are struggling for explanations and believe dna tests will provide the answers to these remarkable burials , ' said @entity33			1
one writer , @entity34 , described the scenes in the graves poignantly as skeletons in ' post-mortal hugs with bony hands clasped together '			1
one theory is that these @entity42 burials show the start of the nuclear family , but another version that after the man died , his wife was killed and buried with him			1
still another suggests that some of the couples were deliberately buried as if in a sexual act , possibly with a young woman sacrificed to play this role in the grave			1
other graves at the site in @entity57 in western @entity13 show adults buried with children			1
professor @entity60 , director of research of the @entity62 of the @entity13 branch of the @entity64 , said : ' we can fantasise a lot about all this			1
' we can allege that husband died and the wife was killed to be interred with him as we see in some @entity71 burials , or maybe the grave stood open for some time and they buried the other person or persons later , or maybe it was really simultaneous death			2
some graves at the site in @entity57 in western @entity13 show adults buried with children one writer described the scenes in the graves poignantly as skeletons in ' post-mortal hugs with bony hands clasped together ' work is underway to establish the ' kinship ' of these ancient couple burials using dna research ' when we speak about a child and an adult , it looks more natural and understandable			1
' when we speak about two adults - it is not so obvious			2
so we can raise quite a variety of hypotheses , but how it was in fact , we do not know yet			0
' work is underway to establish the ' kinship ' of these ancient couple burials using dna research			2
archeologists are struggling for explanations and believe dna tests will provide the answers to these remarkable burials , it was reported the graves contain the bones of couples , facing each other , some with male and female skeletons , their hands held together seemingly for eternity ' for example , we found the burial a man and a child			1
what is a degree of their kinship ? are they father and son or ... ? the same question arises when we found a woman and a child			2
it should seem obvious - she is the mother			0
but it may not be so			0
she could be an aunt , or not a relative at all			0
to speak about this scientifically we need the tools of paleogenetics			0
' we have a joint laboratory with the @entity139 , of the @entity140 of the @entity64 , and we actively work in this direction			0
we do such analysis but it is quite expensive still and there are few specialists			0
we are also solving other questions with help of paleogenetics			0
' with such couple burials , professor @entity149 , of @entity150 , has proposed they are linked to reincarnation beliefs possibly influenced by deeksha rituals in the ancient @entity156 sub-continent at the time when the oldest scriptures of @entity159 were composed			2
' the man during his lifetime donated his body as a sacrifice to all the gods , ' he wrote			0
' the ' deeksha ' was considered as a " second birth " and to complete this ritual the sacrificing one made a ritual sexual act of conceiving			1
' in other words , in death a man should perform a sexual act to impregnate a woman			1
' perhaps in the pre-vedic period relatives of the deceased often sought to reproduce the " deeksha " posthumously , and sacrificed a woman or a girl ( or a few ) , and simulated sexual intercourse in the grave , ' he said			2
professor @entity60 does n't rule out this version , yet makes clear it is only a hypothesis which needs more study			0
' it is again a suggestion			0
as a suggestion , it could be			0
this idea of @entity149 can be extended to @entity13 too , because significant part of the researchers think that @entity42 people were @entity194			2
' so this hypothesis can be extended to them			0
but , i will repeat , it is only a hypothesis			0

the ancient burials were found in @entity12 village in @entity13
dozens of graves contain the bones of couples , facing each other
some were found with their hands held together seemingly for eternity
archeologists struggling to explain why they were buried this way
one theory is some of the couples were buried as if in a sexual act
