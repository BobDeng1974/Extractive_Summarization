former @entity7 missionary @entity6 died after waiting more than an hour for an ambulance			2
her family made desperate 999 calls to @entity9 as they watched deteriorate until her heart stopped miss @entity6 ’s family say they have been left feeling let down by the authorities in the wake of her death			1
miss @entity6 lived with her mother and sister in @entity30 , south west @entity31 , and suffered from diabetes that caused a kidney infection in august last year			1
she was discharged from hospital but complained of nausea and a lack of appetite			2
her sister found her in bed at 11.45pm on september 16			0
she told the inquest , held at @entity41 on friday , miss @entity6 looked ' pale and grey ' and said she was not feeling well			1
she gave her two doses of insulin but her condition did not improve so , at midnight , her mother called 999			2
miss @entity6 was put in the @entity48 category , which @entity9 aims to attend within 20 minutes , although this standard is only achieved in around 65 per cent of cases			1
after 30 minutes , her mother called 999 again to find out where the ambulance was - but was told one had not been dispatched because of high demand.the case was not reclassified after the second call as her condition had not changed			2
however , by midnight miss @entity6 had lost consciousness so a third call was made to 999 - but she was still not reclassified			1
it was not until 1.19am that a paramedic arrived at the scene - by which time miss @entity6 ’s heart had stopped			1
she was taken to hospital but died on september 28 because of damage her brain sustained while her heart was not beating			1
the inquest heard if the ambulance had met its target time , miss @entity6 would have arrived at hospital as her heart stopped			1
miss @entity6 was described as mischievous , very caring , loving , creative and artistic although there is no data for survival rates following cardiac arrests in ambulances , it is accepted that survival rates are increased among those whose hearts stop in hospital			1
dr @entity80 , medical director at @entity9 , said : ' it has become apparent that we give a poorer response time in the last 12 months - our staff are exceptionally highly utilised			0
' it means there are always calls waiting for ambulances			2
four years ago we thought we were busy if we had 900 category a [ the most critical ] calls in a day			0
this weekend we had 1,400 on each day			0
there is a national shortage of paramedics			0
' coroner dr @entity92 said : ' even if the ambulance had come earlier , there is no way we can say she would have had a different outcome			2
yes , she would have had more specialist help on hand but the survival rates following cardiac arrest are still poor			0
” she recorded a narrative verdict , referencing ambulance delays and miss @entity6 ’s health problems			1
but she said it was not for her to investigate the state of the ambulance service and suggested people contact their mps to call for increased funding			2
following the hearing , miss @entity6 ’s sister @entity110 said : ' i feel let down			1
we ’re not out here for compensation or anything like that , we just want things to change but it does n’t feel like that ’s going to happen			0
everyone just seems to have accepted what happened			0
' @entity123 was a person who would do anything for anyone			0
she was mischievous , had a wonderful sense of humour , was very caring , loving , creative and artistic			0
' when she needed help , after helping others so selflessly , it just seemed that no one was available to help her in her time of need			0
' we were always extremely close			0
she was not just my sister , but my very best friend			0
as a family , the three of us have gone through some very hard times but we stuck together and helped each other through them all			0
we feel incomplete without her			0
