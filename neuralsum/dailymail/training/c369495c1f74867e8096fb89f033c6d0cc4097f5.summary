ah , you 've come for some @entity2 budgeting tips , ' says @entity3 as she greets me at the door of her home in @entity7			1
sure enough , two small homemade jam cakes straight from the oven are on the table as i enter her kitchen			2
she can smile about it now , but only just			2
in fact , i have come for one of her now - famous 4p porridge breakfasts			1
four days earlier , @entity16 of @entity17 sparked a major political row after declaring ' the poor ca n't cook ' at a @entity21 press conference			1
digging an even deeper hole , she added insult to injury by saying she had had a bowl of porridge costing 4p that very morning , so much better value than ' a bowl of sugary cereals which will cost you 25p '			1
it was n't just the patronising way it sounded			2
a year 's hard work of research into hunger and food banks by a parliamentary group sponsored by the archbishop of @entity51 no less – sitting right next to @entity3 when she put her size six feet in her mouth – went straight into the anaerobic food incinerator			1
' the world went mad , ' she says			2
' i had death threats			1
' where does she live ? let 's go and get her , ' that kind of thing			0
' @entity64 is a deeply unpleasant place to be			0
' in self - flagellating mood , she reads aloud one letter : ' you are callous , disgusting , bloody nasty and should be stripped of your title			0
' @entity3 relives her blunder in agonising slow motion			1
' i meant to say everyone we met at food banks told us how they wished we had not lost traditional cooking skills			2
but i had n't written it down and somehow it came out as ' poor people ca n't cook '			1
then i mentioned my 4p porridge			1
' i could n't believe it , we had produced a report with 78 recommendations and those four words became the story			2
' far from eating her words , so to speak , the @entity16 even produced a three - course dinner menu for @entity38 , that costs just 57p a head she went ahead with a long - scheduled @entity94 speech on world poverty the next day , but was so shaken , she removed the word ' poor ' from every section to avoid further ridicule			1
but it requires more than that to take the fizz out of @entity3 , a bundle of energy and fun – as she demonstrated by agreeing to cook porridge for me at her @entity17 home			1
and far from eating her words , so to speak , she even produced a three - course dinner menu for @entity38 , that costs just 57p a head			0
they do n't come more @entity44 than @entity3			1
husband , @entity113 mp @entity112 is the son of @entity115 - era cabinet minister @entity114			0
her grandfather was the 1st @entity117			0
she went out with film - maker @entity118 at @entity119 before marrying @entity112			0
@entity118 got playful revenge by planting a wallyish character called @entity112 in most of his films , including @entity123			0
a mother of two grown - up sons , she is the kind of @entity44 mp 's wife who went out of fashion years ago : she believes , having been born into privilege , it is her duty to give something back			0
good housekeeping and plain speaking are in her blood			0
her grandmother , @entity44 mp @entity138 got into trouble in the 1940s for saying : ' i feed my children on bread and dripping			0
' @entity3 says : ' she got the same bucketload over that as i did			1
' for all her wealth , no one can say @entity16 does not know her onions when it comes to living on the breadline			1
every year she takes part in a @entity153 , living on a pound a day for a week to draw attention to hunger in the @entity157			0
she is no blue - rinsed dinosaur and helped @entity159 recruit more women @entity44 mps via her successful @entity162			0
the @entity164 trolls are noisy , but not in the majority			0
for all her wealth , no one can say @entity16 does not know her onions when it comes to living on the breadline : every year she takes part in a @entity153 , living on a pound a day for a week to draw attention to hunger in the @entity157 and has previouslyprepared food in the @entity94 for a soup kitchen ( pictured ) a @entity175 probation officer wrote to her , expressing his disgust at seeing layabout couples on benefits ' hanging around outside courts all day in the sunshine eating steak and chips and drinking bottles of [ light perry ] @entity185 while stuffing ' @entity188 dummies ' [ sausage rolls or pasties ] in the mouths of babies in top - of - the - range buggies '			1
former labour commons speaker baroness @entity194 congratulated her			2
' @entity194 told me ' you 're completely right ' and that when she grew up , every week they would get ' a ninepenny rabbit ' for supper at the end of market day			2
' gaining confidence , @entity3 says : ' i looked up the dictionary definition of poor			1
it is ' lacking sufficient money to live at a standard considered comfortable or normal in a society			0
' it 's as close as saying ' i was right ' as she will go			0
naive maybe , hypocrite no. as she prepares a bowl of her 4p porridge with oats from @entity212 cooked in water , she makes a cup of filter coffee , using folded paper towels as a filter , not dearer , shop - bought filters			1
she scrounged her coffee mugs			0
' got them from a skip , ' she declares with a bargain - hunter 's pride			0
' i was at a conference and they said it was cheaper for them to throw them away than wash them up ! ' @entity3 freely admits her political shortcomings			1
' i 'm an amateur in a pro 's game			0
that 's why i made a cock - up			0
if i had n't had so much support from friends and others , i would have crawled under the duvet			2
' then i thought : i 'm not hiding under a tin hat , i 'm going to go out there and say what i believe : why it 's crazy that families throw away £ 40 worth of food a month , supermarkets throw away 68 per cent of salad bags and fields full of edible food are chucked because they look wonky			0
' i regret being so clumsy , but let 's face it , if i had n't , you would n't be here listening to me talking about the scandal of food waste , would you ? ' or eating a 4p bowl of @entity212 porridge with a spoonful of @entity212 honey.not bad , although i confess i prefer mine with decadent @entity261 raspberries and @entity263 yoghurt at 40p per bowl – and rising			1
it 's not on the menu in @entity3 's kitchen			1
her ' poor ca n't cook ' blunder took the shine off her 59th birthday on the day the food banks report was launched			1
friends handed her a birthday cake for a @entity275 celebration but she got one of them to carry it , in case she was spotted			0
' i could n't risk any ' let them eat cake ' comments , could i ? '			2

also said she *enjoyed* a bowl of porridge every morning which cost just 4p
@entity16 of @entity294 has even had death threats since the *statement*
