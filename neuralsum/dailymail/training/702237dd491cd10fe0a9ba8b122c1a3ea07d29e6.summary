by @entity0 @entity1 : 19:57 est , 22 december 2013 @entity2 : 04:01 est , 23 december 2013 as @entity4 takes his seat in the celestial commentary - box , alongside @entity7 , @entity8 , @entity9 , @entity10 and so many other wonderful broadcasters who became as synonymous with the sports on which they commentated as any actual participant , it is impossible not to reflect on the jabbering inanities that pass for so much television sports coverage today			1
@entity4 was the absolute antithesis of all the modern - day female sports reporters manifestly chosen for their looks rather than their depth of knowledge			1
he must have wondered what had happened to the legacy handed down by him and those other great pioneers of television sport when he watched those touchline dollies who sometimes graduate to presenting jobs , but might as well be fronting programmes about gardening or property make - overs for all the sporting passion they exude			1
sporting giant : @entity4 with @entity39 ( left ) and cricket legend @entity40 ( right ) he was the antithesis , too , of all the ex-footballers who appear to think that playing the game to a high level entitles them to pass off rank platitudes as keen insight			1
it must be said that there are some shining exceptions , among them @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52			2
but from too many of the others , we get banter when we crave analysis , words when we crave silence			2
@entity4 , who died on saturday aged 87 , would never have tolerated that			1
his priority was his audience , and it showed			1
yet he was also respected , even venerated , both by his colleagues and those whose deeds he described			2
the former athlete - turned commentator @entity65 has admitted , with obvious sincerity , that when @entity4 praised him for running well , it meant more to him than anything even his own coach might say			1
and many broadcasters who are now veterans themselves ascribe their success to watching the way @entity4 did it			1
all those who were lucky enough to work alongside him remember his volcanic eruptions of temper when his own high standards were not met			2
@entity82 sports commentator @entity4 at @entity84 's @entity83 ground in 1971 he suffered fools notoriously badly , and there is a great @entity88 clip of him ferociously haranguing a @entity82 cameraman who fluffed an opening link			1
he had spent his @entity91 as an army pe instructor , and one can only imagine what he said to those who shirked their squat thrusts			2
but he was hugely generous to those he admired , or in whom he saw promise , dispensing advice intended to propel them up the career ladder			2
the former @entity82 athletics commentator @entity102 once told me what @entity4 said to him , very succinctly and very firmly , at the beginning of his broadcasting career : ' this is television			1
the commentator should only say what the picture does not say			0
' as a guiding principle , that should be branded in the mind , if not on the forehead , of every tv sports commentator			2
instead , it is treated these days as just another dusty , irrelevant maxim , like @entity120 's original remit for the @entity82 to ' inform , educate and entertain '			0
sports commentator @entity4 's priority was his audience , and it showed listening to one of @entity4 's football commentaries now is indeed a kind of re-education			1
no banalities , no wasted words , and yet all the more potent for it			0
' @entity131 ... one - nil , ' was how he greeted one of the most dramatic of all @entity134 final goals , for under - dog @entity135 against the then mighty @entity137 in 1973			2
it was all that was required			0
he did n't go on to tell us that @entity131 shared a birthday with @entity143 , or whatever inconsequential fact might be trotted out today , because we did n't need to know			0
@entity102 also told me : ' i also used to listen to the way in which he used intonation			0
in his athletics commentaries you could tell the difference between a heat , a semi-final and a final just by the way he used his voice			0
' before a final he would be silent , and then he would simply say : " the @entity161 men 's 100 metres final " and the hairs would stand up on the back of your neck			0
' but such economy of style did n't mean a lack of preparation			0
on the contrary , nobody prepared more thoroughly than @entity4 , as i once heard from another of his proteges , the football commentator @entity171			1
' he told me to immerse myself in the game i was covering and i 'm still following that advice today , ' said @entity171			0
' that 's the way he brought me up			0
' what @entity4 brought both to the commentary - box and the presenter 's chair were iron - clad journalistic virtues			1
born in 1926 in @entity181 , @entity182 , he had been a reporter on the @entity183 and briefly edited another newspaper before joining the @entity82 in 1954 , so he knew how to tell a story concisely			0
that background in news was never more evident than in 1972 , when he reported live and unscripted , with utterly unruffled and eloquent solemnity , from the @entity189 in @entity190 , where 11 @entity192 athletes were taken hostage and then murdered by @entity195 terrorists			0
he would eventually cover 16 summer and winter @entity161 and six @entity196 , as well as presenting @entity197 and @entity198 with @entity4 for many years , but that broadcast from @entity190 was his finest hour			1
it proved the value of giving presenting jobs in television sport to trained journalists , another tradition that has evaporated in recent years , as our broadcasting companies fall over each other in the rush to hire former sportsmen and women , giving precious little thought , it sometimes seems , to whether they actually have the right qualities			0
@entity216 , @entity217 and @entity218 were bright and diligent enough to acquire them , but it 's still worth wondering whether a @entity4 or a @entity221 would reach the front of the career race today			1
they would have to wrestle past an awfully crowded field of ex-players to get there			0
and if they did n't get there , think what we would lose			0
what , in fact , we might already have lost			0
crucially , @entity4 did have some sporting pedigree of his own			1
as a fine middle - distance runner he had been an @entity161 hopeful in 1952 until injury denied him the chance of a trial , so he understood athletics from both sides of the track			2
an understanding and love of sport informed every one of his broadcasts , from that tour de force in @entity190 in 1972 to hundreds of episodes as quizmaster on @entity249 from 1979 to 1997			0
but it was underpinned by a newsman 's instincts , and of course it is ironic — and not a little unfair — that a man who put in so many hours of homework should have given his name to the on - air gaffe , thanks to the @entity262 column @entity260			2
frankly , when you 're performing live under the kind of pressure @entity4 faced every day of his tv career , the occasional fluff is inevitable			1
another irony is that such a consummate professional should have inspired one of the most bumbling comic creations of recent times , in the hapless form of the @entity275 character @entity274			0
long before he wound up on @entity276 , @entity274 was a @entity82 sports reporter , whose mannerisms ( and diamond - patterned pullovers ) were plainly influenced by @entity4			1
and before that , @entity4 was lampooned in latex by the satirical show @entity282 , excitably crying ' quite remarkable ! ' well , ' quite remarkable ' is as good an epitaph as any for @entity4			1
he was a true giant of broadcasting , and his passing offers a reminder that television sport now is populated by far too many who really do n't deserve a place in his long shadow .			0

@entity4 was ' the antithesis of modern - day female sports reporters '
' his priority was his audience , and it showed '
