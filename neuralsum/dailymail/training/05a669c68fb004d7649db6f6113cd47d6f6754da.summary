by @entity0 published : 10:23 est , 26 august 2013 updated : 14:19 est , 27 august 2013 a father has told how his ‘ innocent , beautiful ’ one - year - old son lost a leg to meningitis			1
@entity6 ’s son , @entity5 , one , contracted meningococcal meningitis and septicaemia in march , when he was just eight - months - old , and had to spend six weeks in hospital fighting for his life			1
the disease caused the lower part of his left leg to die meaning that it had to be amputated			1
@entity14 contracted meningococcal meningitis and septicaemia in march , when he was just eight - months - old , and had to spend six weeks in hospital fighting for his life @entity5 , from @entity16 , also lost the ends of all of his fingers and some of his toes			1
his parents realised that there was something wrong when he became lethargic and lost his appetite			2
as this is not unusual for a baby , they were not overly concerned			0
however , later that day his lethargy increased and he stopped reacting to his parents entirely			2
as a result , they rushed him to the local hospital where a doctor thought he might have bronchiolitis – a lower respiratory tract infection			2
he was not entirely sure of the diagnosis so suggested that @entity5 be taken to @entity34 , @entity16			0
@entity5 ( pictured with his parents , @entity36 and @entity6 , and his brother , @entity37 ) lost the lower part of his left leg , the tips of all of his fingers and some of the toes on his remaining foot @entity5 's parents realised that there was something wrong when he became lethargic and went off his food			1
he deteriorated rapidly and soon became unresponsive and developed breathing difficulties when he arrived , he started to deteriorate rapidly			0
mr @entity6 said : ‘ @entity5 was struggling for breath and his heart rate and blood pressure were low			0
‘ he started getting a few spots around his eyes and mouth and luckily for us the doctors could see his symptoms developing and they quickly suspected meningitis and acted accordingly			0
‘ he was put on numerous drips , and was sedated with help from a ventilator machine to regulate his breathing			0
@entity5 was rushed to @entity34 , @entity16 , where doctors diagnosed his meningitis and put him on a ventilator to regulate his breathing ‘ very quickly it became apparent that he was losing and leaking fluid internally , so they were forced to replace the liquids very quickly			0
’ within a few hours , @entity5 ’s body had swelled up and he was fighting for his life			0
his parents were told that he might not survive the night			2
mr @entity6 said : ‘ we were told to prepare for the worst but to take things minute by minute			1
at the hospital , @entity5 's parents were told to prepare themselves for the worst			1
as the disease took hold , he lost the circulation to his extremities which meant his lower leg and the tips of his fingers died ‘ what was easily the most horrific and scariest few hours of mine , and my family ’s , life , then turned into a waiting game as we could n't see @entity5 as the medical staff were working furiously to keep him alive			1
’ as @entity5 ’s body fought the disease , he lost circulation to his hands and feet and they quickly turned black			0
doctors made three cuts along his lower left leg in an attempt to ease the pressure , and to try and restore the circulation			1
@entity5 's left leg was amputated below the knee and the tips of his fingers and toes fell off without surgery			1
his parents say that he started to crawl again very quickly after leaving hospital despite this effort , it was soon clear that his lower left leg was dead tissue and that it was only acting as another hindrance to him as he battled for his life			1
as a result , the decision was made to amputate @entity5 ’s lower left leg below the knee			1
mr @entity6 said : ’ after the amputation , @entity5 started improving day by day , but the tips of his fingers and toes remained black and dead			2
over the next few weeks , he stayed in hospital improving all the while			2
‘ after ten days he was brought out of sedation and , after what seemed like an eternity , our little boy woke up			0
@entity5 's father , @entity6 said : ' i can only say the whole experience was surreal , horrifying and extremely concerning			0
' @entity5 is pictured with his brother , @entity37 ‘ his fingertips and toes gradually settled at being black , shrivelled and dead and we were informed they would probably fall away over time - it was just a hope for him to get as much back of them as possible			2
’ @entity5 finally left hospital after six weeks and returned home to recover			1
his father said : ‘ @entity5 started crawling again very quickly , and once his fingers tips had fallen away he started using his hands like nothing had ever happened - like he was n't missing parts of them			0
‘ in total he lost his lower left leg , the tips of all his fingers in varying degrees and half of his remaining toes - except the big one on which he just lost the nail			1
’ mr @entity6 said : ' i knew about the effects of meningitis beforehand from what i 'd seen on the news , but i never thought something so cruel could happen so indiscriminately to an innocent , beautiful child ' mr @entity6 added : ‘ i can only say the whole experience was surreal , horrifying and extremely concerning			0
‘ the thought of losing our baby was inconceivable and thankfully we got most of him back to where he should be , home			2
‘ i would n't wish this experience on anyone			0
i knew about the effects of meningitis beforehand from what i ’d seen on the news , but i never thought something so cruel could happen so indiscriminately to an innocent , beautiful child			0
’ ‘ i can never ever thank the medical staff who treated and saved @entity5 ’s life enough , i owe them everything			0
’ @entity5 is now learning to walk with a prosthetic leg ( pictured )			1
his parents hope he will be able to walk down the aisle as a page boy at his uncle 's wedding next year mr and mrs @entity182 have just secured @entity5 his first prosthetic leg and say that within 15 minutes of having it fitted , he stood up on it for the first time			1
