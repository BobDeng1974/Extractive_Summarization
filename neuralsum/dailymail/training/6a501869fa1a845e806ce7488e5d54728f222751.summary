and according to interviews with former scientologists and former @entity11 members , her fears appear to be well founded			1

they can also involve manual labour , wearing black clothes to mark you out from everybody else - and can go on for years			0
then there are the alleged beatings at the hands of leaders and @entity44 , two trailers which can hold up to 100 people forced to do group confessions all night			0
in one episode detailed in an piece in the @entity82 , those put in @entity44 were told that they had to play a game of musical chairs and only the person who won would be allowed to stay			0
as the @entity148 hit ‘ @entity150 ’ boomed out of the stereo , it took until 4am before there was a winner , by which time things turned violent with one chair being ripped in two			0
battle : @entity14 has filed for divorce from husband @entity7 and has asked for sole custody of @entity10			0

she claimed to have been pressured into having two abortions because rules state she could not have children , although they lost the case			2
@entity11 dates back to 1966 when @entity4 founder @entity93 sought to take his followers on sea breaks to continue his research into the ‘ upper levels of spiritual awareness ’			1
he bought several small ships and staffed them with a young crew of @entity61 and reportedly went looking for treasure he had hidden in a previous life			0
rough terrain : members are allegedly banned from leaving the isolated base , according to former members fun and games ? leisure facilities on the compound include basketball courts former @entity11 member @entity209 has claimed that she was once on a boat with @entity93 who showed her a map with crosses on it and claimed there was buried treasure under each cross			1

. feeling green : the compound has a number of leisure facilities including a swimming pool , a golf course and a baseball field devotion : the church at the @entity4 compound in @entity20 his wife @entity251 has denied it is a @entity4 school and said that it would be ‘ straight evil ’ to suggest she was putting money into a education establishment which also sought to convert children to any religion			2
donation : @entity57 , with wife @entity251 , gave $ 1.2million to the @entity239 but while it is secular , multiple reports across media organisations in the @entity262 and the @entity263 claim it does have ties to @entity4 and uses ‘ study technology ’ , which was created by @entity93			2
it also feeds into the $ 42,000 a year @entity272 in @entity273 where as many as half the pupils are @entity61 , the @entity269 reported			0
among the pupils there are @entity276 and @entity277 , 17 and 19 , @entity7 ’s children with ex-wife @entity279			0
@entity280 , a former senior executive in @entity4 told the @entity269 : ‘ @entity10 is coming to an age where she gets educated enough to get locked into the faith			0
