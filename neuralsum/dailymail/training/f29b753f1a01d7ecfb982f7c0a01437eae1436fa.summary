a short - sighted woman is suing high street optical chain @entity2 for £ 1million claiming that laser surgery ruined her dream of becoming a policewoman			1
@entity7 , 28 , spent £ 2,900 to improve her vision because her poor eyesight was preventing her from fulfilling her ambition to join the police , a court heard			1
but the procedure went disastrously wrong and has left her so sensitive to light she has to wear sun glasses in the shower , it was claimed			1
she is suing @entity29 , the company behind high street laser surgery chain , @entity2 , as well as the surgeon who carried out the operation , dr @entity23			1
her lawyers value her damages for pain , suffering and loss of earnings at £ 1million			1
@entity37 , miss @entity7 's barrister , told the judge she was 21 and working as a buyer for an antiquarian books dealer when she decided to have the photo - refractive keratectomy procedure at the @entity43 branch of @entity2			1
over the last few years , laser eye surgery has become a mainstream treatment for poor eyesight			1
a whole host of celebrities , including @entity49 , @entity51 @entity50 , @entity52 and @entity53 , have had the operation			0
laser eye surgery works by removing tissue from the cornea to change its shape			2
there are different types of laser eye surgery but @entity62 - which stands for @entity62 - is the most common			2
the procedure involves applying anaesthetic drops , after which a small flap is made on the surface of the cornea using a hand - held femtosecond laser device			2
the vast majority of operations pass off with no ill - effects			0
there are many advantages : there is little or no pain , recovery is quick and both eyes can be treated at once			0
however , the cutting of the flap requires skill and in one to four per cent of cases , this can cause problems			2
the flap can be damaged or even lost ; stray particles can get trapped under the flap ; there is a minor risk of infection ; there is even a small risk of penetration of the eye by the very fine surgical blade used to cut the flap , which could potentially cause blindness			0
the other problem is that , apart from being a doctor , no specialist qualifications are legally required to carry out laser eye surgery			2
he said : ' the procedure was intended to improve or correct her myopia			0
she wanted to join the police force			1
' mr @entity37 said she was left with severe photophobia by the laser procedure in february 2008 , which is an extreme sensitivity to bright light			0
it means she has to wear dark glasses the majority of the time			2
he added : ' she is in a considerably worse position than before treatment and is visually disabled			0
' he also said she had developed clinical depression as a result			0
mr @entity37 went on to say there was a failure by dr @entity121 to properly explain the treatment to @entity123 and warn her of the risks			0
from the witness box , miss @entity7 , of @entity125 , in @entity126 , said she had lost her job in the antique books trade and could not find alternative employment because her vision was so impaired			1
she said : ' i was in a good position in my life			0
i loved to read and i loved to look at art. i was unaware of the risks and i was never told of any of the risks			2
' she went to explain that , post surgery , her eyes were so bad she could n't cook for fear of burning herself and needed help to go outside and dress herself			0
but , @entity145 , representing @entity2 , put to @entity123 that she was clearly warned by dr @entity121 she risked being left with ' a very bad result ' because of the type of eyes she had			1
he also claimed that miss @entity7 was exaggerating her post-operative visual difficulties			1
the hearing involving laser surgery that went wrong is being heard at @entity24 , sitting at the @entity153 ( above ) ' you were able to see sufficiently well in 2011 , and now , to dress yourself , ' mr @entity155 said , accusing her ' putting it on ' and ' grossly exaggerating ' her problems			1
mr @entity155 told the judge that video surveillance evidence ' entirely contradicted ' her claims about the extent of her visual disability			0
outside court , miss @entity7 's mother , @entity20 , said : ' the laser eye surgery business is not properly regulated and anybody can walk in off the streets like my daughter and have their life ruined			1
' of course accidents happen , but people need to know the risks			0
' the hearing continues .			0
