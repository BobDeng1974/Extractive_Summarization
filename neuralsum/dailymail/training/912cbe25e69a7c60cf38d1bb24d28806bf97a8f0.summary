being on the receiving end of a bird 's droppings is meant to bring good luck , according to the superstitious			0
but @entity4 has n't had much joy for the last four months			1
her bizarre plan to make music based on bird poo , partly funded by the taxpayer , has run into difficulties - because of a lack of muck			1
since june , visitors to parks in @entity15 may have seen the self - proclaimed environmental artist laying huge , blank musical scores between trees and encouraging birds to do their business on them			1
bizarre : environmental artist @entity4 is trying to make music based on droppings , but the taxpayer - funded project has been hampered because birds have n't produced enough disinterested ? since june , miss @entity4 has laid huge , blank musical scores between trees and encouraged birds to do their business on them her plan was that the positioning of the splats on the stave would inspire a new musical work to be performed in the city 's @entity33			1
unfortunately , the birds have been rather less than co-operative , and the 47 - year - old is still waiting for sufficient offerings from the sky to create the piece			1
the performance was initially expected to be held this month , but @entity15 stressed it had never been scheduled for a specific date and denied the project was running late			0
miss @entity4 , whose previous work has included an attempt to create art from dog mess , came up with the idea , entitled @entity48 , while sitting in a park with friends			1
launching the project in june , she described how it would ‘ harness some of their ( the birds ' ) fundamental doings ’ to take ‘ by chance nature ’s calls and represent what comes naturally ’			2
she went on : ‘ i will be laying blank score - on a scale of great magnitude - underneath places where birds roost and feed			2
‘ as the birds go about their daily business , droppings will fall onto the score below			2
‘ each splat on the score will form a musical note , a cache of poo , an embellished score : bird s * * * music			0
’ the dropping marks were to be adapted by composer @entity75 , but finding birds prepared to take part in the project has proved harder than expected			2
‘ i thought it would be very straightforward first of all - they sit in a tree , they eat , they poo , you get the bird music and there you go - @entity86 , ’ miss @entity4 said			1
' but it ’s not like that at all			0
’ a film crew accompanied miss @entity4 for four hours last week , but the birds provided only one note - an @entity93 the artist said : ‘ i have had to learn about bird behaviour and find out when and where they nest and perch , so my bird - spotting skills have developed considerably			1
’ it 's oh so quiet : the bird dropping splats on the sheets are to be used for a new musical work to be performed at the @entity15 project : artist @entity106 , who has been helping miss @entity4 , records sounds of the wilderness next to an large piece of sheet music laid down to capture bird droppings perhaps @entity4 should have followed the old adage ' never work with children or animals '			1
but she is not the first musician to have tried to involve the animal kingdom in her work			0
the @entity119 song @entity120 , from the 1967 album @entity121 , ends with an extremely high note which only dogs can hear			0
the high note is said to have been dubbed into the track by producer @entity125 at the request of @entity127 , pictured			0
@entity130 ' critically - acclaimed 1966 album @entity131 includes animal noises and even has a picture of the band visiting a zoo on the front cover			0
and the video to dance act @entity139 's song @entity141 ? featured monkeys with superimposed human faces			0
miss @entity4 has been helped by artist @entity106 , who is recording sounds of the woodland for a planned exhibition			1
although sheets with a combined length of more than 400ft have been suitably soiled , another 160ft is needed before the composition can begin			0
miss @entity4 , from @entity151 , @entity152 , is studying for a phd at @entity154 and incorporates elements from natural landscapes or wild animals in her work			2
three years ago she invited walkers on a canal towpath to dodge dog mess , rewarding them with a sticker , a mug of tea and a biscuit if they succeeded			0
@entity48 is one of four projects she is working on as part of @entity15 ’s series of outdoor exhibitions , our @entity15 landscape : from @entity173 to today			2
it is understood to be partially funded through a £ 50,000 grant made by the @entity176 towards the gallery ’s major events programme			1
according to the exhibition ’s website the projects are also supported by the @entity182 in @entity183			0
@entity15 said no other public money funded @entity48 but declined to say how much of the @entity176 grant had gone towards it			1
it said the @entity187 @entity182 had supported the gallery ’s exhibition @entity190 : later paintings which inspired the @entity193 productions , rather than the projects themselves			0
a spokeswoman for @entity15 said : ‘ the project is ongoing because @entity4 is still collecting the bird droppings for the music			1
‘ it is our intention to have the transcribed composition performed at @entity15 by the composer @entity75 in the near future			0
’ prestigious : @entity48 is one of four projects @entity208 is working on as part of a series of outdoor exhibitions at @entity15			2

artist @entity4 has spent four months trying to collect droppings
she lays blank music sheets on the ground for birds to defecate on to
she hopes the positioning of the splats will inspire a new piece of music
@entity48 project is partly funded by an @entity176 grant
