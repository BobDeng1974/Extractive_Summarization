in @entity1 ’s perfect world football would be a non-contact sport			1
@entity4 , as described by @entity3 , would be a work of art un-desecrated by physical collision			1
supremely gifted players – like himself in his glory years with @entity10 – would be free to paint their masterpieces on the canvas of the pitch without fear of pain or injury			1
getting stuck in : @entity17 and @entity18 put in a challenge on @entity21 defender @entity20 possession would be gained by perfectly - timed nudging away of the ball from the feet of a rival , by interception , or by passing error or mis - control by the opponent			1
thus defending would become a fine art in itself			1
all the energy poured into thunderous tackles and aerial combat wold be channelled into pace , power - running and kaleidoscopic movement on and off the ball			1
the @entity38 president has long - envisioned the purity of such contests of supreme skills , high intelligence and creative imagination			1
that idealistic concept lies at the heart of @entity1 ’s unease with the robust , headlong , get stuck in , up - and - at - ‘ em football which is the commercial driving force of the @entity48			1
this makes for super-charged thrills for mass audiences , if not for the greatest league in the world which it fancies itself to be			1
@entity1 cherishes excellence above excitement and every four years since 1966 the @entity57 has come around to help him remind @entity58 that the game ’s supreme prize goes to the craftsmen , not the crash - bang - wallopers			1
now he is seeking legislation to tip the balance in favour of talent over intimidation			2
@entity1 ’s latest wheeze – for which he has the support of legendary referee @entity70 – is to punish players who inflict physical damage by keeping them off the pitch for as long as their victims need treatment			1
@entity70 , now @entity1 ’s head of refereeing , said this week : ‘ it is not fair for teams to gain a temporary one - player advantage by injuring an opponent			1
’ now , in that perfect world of @entity1 ’s there would appear to be some merit in the proposal			1
crunching : @entity86 captain @entity85 throws everything at @entity89 's @entity88 but in the real football world , which sadly is inhabited by at least as many cunning cheats as true sportsmen , it is not only riddled with complication but fraught with the possibility for exploitation			1
what better way to nullify a genius like @entity100 than for a lesser opponent to feign injury after a first - minute challenge with him and then keep both of them off the pitch for the remaining 89 minutes ? as it is referees have the devil ’s own job discerning whether a player has dived or been fouled			2
now they would have to decide not only if someone has been deliberately hacked down but if he really is badly hurt			2
and where would it end ? if @entity100 ‘ s supposed victim was to be out for months , would @entity117 ’s maestro continue to be sidelined until such time as that man recovered ? thunderous : @entity122 of @entity123 crashes into @entity125 midfielder @entity124 as with so many of @entity1 ’s ideas , this one is well intentioned but impractical to the point of naivety			1
with this man it seems you have to take the bad with good , the sensible with the eccentric			2
@entity1 is also coming round to favouring the idea of sin - bins , as employed in rugby for example			1
the rationale here is that it is better for such 10 or 15 - minute expulsions to benefit the opposing team during the game in question , rather than to impose cautions which remove the culprits from future matches			2
now this one makes better sense , since it would discourage not only the choppers but also the divers			2
but since @entity1 ’s long game would appear to be to eliminate the honest tackle , that would take such qualities as courage and commitment out of a game which is supposed to be played by heroes			1
if that were to happen monsieur @entity38 ’s @entity160 would become a bland , sanitised , aesthetic but eventually unexciting place to be			2
dislike : @entity1 ( left ) seems to want to do away with that staple of the @entity166 game , the hard challenge for more years than some of us care to remember this has been one of football ’s cardinal maxims : you win nothing with kids			1
in truth that should have been amended long ago to something like this : you win nothing without kids but they need some shrewd older heads to guide them			2
thus the real sanity of @entity183 ’s selection is not that it is the youngest @entity58 squad for more than half a century but that it contains that crucial mix of youth and experience			2
there have been mutterings among the most zealous reformers about the inclusion , for example , of 35 - year - old @entity193 in the party bound for @entity195			0
@entity196 : @entity193 's experience will be invaluable to @entity58 in @entity195 but while @entity198 comes from the in - between years which separate @entity193 and @entity200 from such youngsters as @entity202 , @entity203 , @entity204 and @entity205 , would he really have bridged the generation gap to better effect ? while @entity198 and has been unable to bale out that floundering @entity208 called @entity123 , @entity193 has helped keep @entity89 afloat			0
not only is he the most prolific midfield goalscorer of the era but his engine continues to run as smoothly and tirelessly as ever			0
if @entity204 promises to be @entity58 ’s @entity211 against @entity212 , then @entity193 is @entity183 ’s @entity196			0
@entity200 has been a similar driving force behind @entity215 ’s resurgence			0
but unlike the @entity58 captain , @entity193 has not yet had to modify his game to that of the creative anchor man in midfield			0
he can still lead the charge , as well as by example			0
mentor : @entity193 will be a good influence on @entity204 ( left ) and @entity205 if @entity58 are to prosper in @entity195 , the teenagers and 20 - year - olds to whom @entity183 has turned to invigorate the stagnate pool of @entity225 will need that experience to help them focus their energetic assaults on the best defences on the planet			0
@entity233 are never all about flat - out attack			0
often , these finals are played in draining heat and humidity			0
always , they are refereed to standards far stricter than those applied in the @entity48			0
there are elements of building for @entity243 2018 in @entity183 ’s choice			0
but if a more promising future is not to be undermined by a crushing retreat from @entity249 , then the wisdom of the ages must play its part at @entity195 2014			0
@entity251 has been presented with the most historic and prestigious individual honour in the @entity166 game			0
in years gone by the diving , biting antics which almost forced his deportation from the @entity48 would have precluded his election as @entity259 by we members of the @entity262 – his marvellous goalscoring talent notwithstanding			0
times have changed and standards altered			0
times are a changing : @entity251 has been named @entity268 despite his dubious past true legend : sir @entity271 was a superb footballer and a gentleman off the pitch striking example : @entity275 ( with trophy ) is another great of the @entity166 game iconic : @entity278 was the best @entity166 defender of all time and a former @entity262 winner to be fair to the @entity281 who will threaten @entity58 ’s progress in @entity195 , @entity251 has been making a conscious effort to reform himself at @entity215 of late			0
eventually history will judge him by how he wears the crown which has just been placed upon his head in @entity288			0
hopefully , when he surveys such names as sir @entity271 , sir @entity295 , sir @entity296 , @entity278 , @entity275 , @entity297 , @entity298 , @entity299 , @entity300 and , close to home , @entity200 among the galaxy of previous winners , the message that behaviour matters as much as brilliance will be driven home to @entity251			0

@entity1 and @entity70 are trying to make football a non-contact sport
gifted players would be able to stroll around free from *obstruction*
