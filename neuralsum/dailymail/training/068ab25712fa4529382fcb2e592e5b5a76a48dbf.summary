deputy prime minister @entity0 insisted @entity2 society has been shaped by migrant communities , but unveiled tougher action against illegal immigration @entity0 today dramatically admitted he was wrong to offer an amnesty to illegal immigrants			1
the @entity9 leader used his first speech on immigration since the general election in 2010 to ditch his party ’s policy of allowing foreigners to ‘ earn ’ @entity2 citizenship by living in the @entity2 for a decade without being caught by the authorities			1
he said the policy , included in his party ’s last manifesto , risked undermining public confidence in the entire immigration system			1
the deputy prime minister instead unveiled new plans to force foreigners arriving in @entity2 from ‘ high risk countries ’ to pay a bond of more than £ 1,000 which will only be repaid when they leave			1
but his attempt to reposition the @entity9 as taking a tougher line on immigration was at odds with warnings last night from his @entity35 colleague @entity34			1
the business secretary claimed attempts to slash net immigration were ' unattainable ' and risked causing ' enormous damage ' to the economy			1
@entity41 is due to set out the @entity43 approach to immigration on monday , after @entity46 leader @entity45 admitted his party made mistakes when it was in government			2
today mr @entity0 used a speech in central @entity51 to set out his vision of a ‘ tolerant @entity2 , zero - tolerant of abuse ’			1
he insisted that if immigrant workers suddenly ‘ downed tools , countless businesses and services would suffer ’ and the @entity59 ‘ would fall over ’ - but warned borders were ‘ grossly mismanaged ’ under @entity46			0
mr @entity0 argued that cash penalties for unscrupulous employers who knowingly hire illegal immigrants because they are cheaper must be increased			1
currently , the maximum fine is £ 10,000 per illegal worker			2
and he revealed he has asked the @entity66 to work up a ‘ system of security bonds ’ worth more than £ 1,000 for people from ‘ high risk ’ countries , which could be piloted by the @entity72 ( @entity72 ) as early as the end of the year			1
he told the @entity75 think tank : ‘ in certain cases , when a visa applicant is coming from a high risk country in addition to satisfying the normal criteria @entity72 would be able to request a deposit – a kind of cash guarantee			0
‘ once the visitor leaves @entity2 , the bond will be repaid			2
but the deputy prime minister dramatically ditched the @entity9 ’ long - held but controversial policy to offer an amnesty to illegal immigrants			1
he said : ‘ at the last election we suggested that any illegal immigrant who had been here for 10 years should be able to earn their citizenship			1
‘ we called it an earned route to citizenship			2
our opponents dubbed it an “ amnesty ”			0
@entity2 people needed to know that immigration rules are ' reasonable , just , and properly enforced , mr @entity0 told the @entity75 think tank ‘ we felt it was an honest and pragmatic solution given the chaos in the @entity66 and the obvious failure by @entity46 to identify where thousands of illegal immigrants were			1
‘ better surely , we asked , to get them to pay their taxes and make a proper contribution to our society , than to continue to live in the shadows ? ‘ but , despite the policy ’s aims , it was seen by many people as a reward for those who have broken the law			0
‘ and so it risked undermining public confidence in the immigration system - the very public confidence that is essential to a tolerant and open @entity2			1
‘ that is why i am no longer convinced this specific policy should be retained in our manifesto for the next general election			0
’ the speech comes as the government toughens its stance on immigration with a range of new measures aimed at bringing down net migration to the tens of thousands			0
@entity72 officials will conduct interviews with more than 100,000 student visa applicants from ' high - risk ' countries outside the @entity150 to crack down on bogus students			0
and a ; genuine entrepreneur ' test has been introduced to tackle the rising number of foreign nationals attempting to enter @entity2 by fudging their bank accounts			2
but in the wake of criticism from politicians and the higher education sector , some immigration rules were recently loosened in a bid to give additional flexibility to businesses and allow top international students to pursue careers in @entity2			1
mr @entity0 said the immigration must ' command public confidence '			2
he added : ' for a diverse society like ours to function successfully , for different groups to integrate and co-exist , @entity2 citizens must believe that the rules by which migrants come and settle here are reasonable , just , and properly enforced			1
prime minister @entity41 also floated the idea of immigration bonds and @entity179 plans to announce a pilot scheme targeted at ' high risk ' individuals the @entity183 revealed in march that home secretary @entity179 was planning immigration bonds as the next stage of reform , having succeeded in cutting net migration to its lowest level for a decade			1
the cash would only be repaid when people leave the country and demonstrate that they have not drawn on particular services , such as non-urgent @entity59 care or elements of the welfare state			0
business secretary @entity34 warned attempts to reduce net migration were ' unattainable ' mrs may plans to announce a pilot scheme targeted at ‘ high risk ’ individuals from ‘ two or three nationalities ’ starting later this year			1
they or family members already in the @entity2 would be required to put up a sum running into thousands of pounds as security that they will abide by the rules			2
the 1999 @entity209 allows the @entity2 to require a financial security from temporary migrants , which can be forfeited if they fail to leave the @entity2 after the expiry of their visa			1
prime minister @entity41 also floated the idea of immigration bonds last year			2
one @entity43 source said mr @entity0 appeared to be ‘ purloining conservative ideas ’ in an attempt to shift perceptions of his party ’s position on a key issue			0
in another blow , @entity9 business secretary @entity34 gave an interview pouring scorn on the @entity43 aim of reducing net immigration from the hundreds to the tens of thousands			1
‘ it is n’t @entity231 policy , it is @entity43 policy			0
and it ’s also not true because that policy purely relates to @entity236 people			0
we have obviously no control over the @entity150 and that is actually where much of the movement comes , ’ mr @entity34 told @entity228			2
‘ the reducing to under 100,000 is not government policy and it would be unattainable without , if it was attainable enormous damage would be done , notably through overseas students , which is one of the biggest components			0
’ the business secretary said attempts to tighten the visa system had created the impression , particularly in @entity252 , that ‘ @entity2 is closed ’			1
mr @entity0 praised the diversity of the country 's population and says that @entity2 is made up of rich and varied backgrounds ‘ we want overseas students , they are good for us , they are not bad for us			2
they bring in lots of money			0
' we want to have lots of visitors from all over the world coming here without hassle , an easy flexible visa system and we have lots of highly specialised people in engineers , top managers who we need in our companies and they ’ve got to be able to come and go freely otherwise we are not going to be able to compete internationally , ’ mr @entity34 added			1
‘ so i do have to keep banging the drum for that			0
’ mr @entity0 insisted that the @entity9 ‘ will never seek to outflank our opponents ’ on immigration ‘ because we think that ’s what people want to hear ’			1
‘ that kind of low populism patronises the @entity2 people			2
and it is an insult to the many migrants who have contributed to our country , ’ he said			0
‘ @entity2 society has been shaped by migrant communities in ways more profound than any cliché about chicken tikka masala , or @entity287 , or @entity289 builders can ever express			2
' i ’m the son of a @entity292 mother - she , herself , raised in @entity293 ; a half - @entity294 father ; husband to a @entity296 wife			0
like millions of @entity297 , if you trace our blood lines back through the generations , you end up travelling around the globe			0
’ but he savaged @entity46 for leaving an immigration system in ‘ disarray ’			1
‘ i can not stress enough just how chaotic it was			0
the first thing they did , after coming into office , was stop checking if people were leaving the country			0
they got rid of exit checks			0
they were n’t counting people in and they were n’t counting people out either , ’ the deputy prime minister added			0
‘ since we came into government , net migration has fallen by a third			0
we ’ve capped immigration from outside @entity320			0
and within the @entity150 , we have kept the transitional limits on @entity322 and @entity323 , until the point where every member state has to remove them			0
' a @entity66 source said : ‘ we look forward to support for all our immigration policies and getting down to the tens of thousands			1
