@entity0 also joined the @entity14 arm of the worldwide @entity92 last year			1
during that march , energy bills were burned , fireworks were shot at @entity106 and there were 15 arrests , following scuffles with police			2

today , it seemed the group were hoping for a similar result			0
on its website before the march , one of the group members wrote : ' what i 'd like to see is a massive @entity11 blockade of @entity182			2
only thing that gets through are @entity185 and ambulances			0
' fireworks and smoke were seen rising out of @entity22 as the protest got underway this evening the crowd tried its best to carry out the wishes of the organisers , which asked for a massive blockade of @entity182 the group - which uses the @entity5 masks as its trademark - said it fights against mass surveillance , austerity and infringement of human rights the protest was held on the night of @entity128 's @entity5 , and many of the marchers wore the white masks of the man who plotted to blow up parliament in 1605 protesters chanted anti-establishment slogans as they milled around , while others climbed on to the base of @entity103 let off fireworks the group also warned it would have ' bigger banners , louder voices , more people and a louder system '			1

protesters waved banners and placards during the march the protesters came up with a number of creative ways to express their messages of discontent the group said in its manifesto that it fights again mass surveillance , austerity and infringement of human rights anti-capitalist protesters held up signs saying ' expect @entity271 ' ' we are @entity11 ' and ' we are everyone ' rather than communicate directly with local authorities , @entity11 sent a message to the government the protesters made their way through central @entity14 , going to @entity109 , @entity110 and @entity111 and it added that they have imposed @entity280 of the @entity281 across @entity3 between 5pm today and 2am tomorrow , which provides powers to remove masks when police fear a crime will be committed			1
@entity287 said : ' @entity288 deals with around 4,500 protests and events every year			0
these can range from a single protester to hundreds of thousands of people walking through the capital 's streets			2
' officers work with organisers to ensure that people are able to carry out their right to peaceful protest whilst ensuring @entity301 can go about their daily business			0
' last year â€™s @entity14 march saw more than 2,500 protesters take to the streets , in a rally which saw fireworks thrown at @entity106 and a total of 15 arrests			1
rather than communicate directly with local authorities , @entity11 sent a message to the government , and to global world leaders : ' to oppressive governments , we say this : we do not expect our campaign to be completed in a short time frame			2
however , you will not prevail against the angry masses of the body politic			0
