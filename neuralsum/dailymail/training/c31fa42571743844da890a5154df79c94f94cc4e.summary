the @entity0 is now the world 's biggest supplier of oil overtaking the world number one , @entity5 , according to latest output figures			1
a surge in @entity0 oil output , which includes natural gas liquids and biofuels , has swelled 3.2 million barrels per day ( bpd ) since 2009			1
the spike in oil production is the fastest expansion over a four - year period since @entity5 's output surge from 1970 - 1974 , energy analysis firm @entity12 said in a statement			1
lead supplier : the @entity0 has overtaken @entity5 as the world 's leading supplier of oil , including crude , natural liquid gas and biofuels			1
pictured , a well pumping oil in an field near @entity28 , @entity29 it was the latest milestone for the @entity0 oil sector caused by the shale revolution , which has upended global oil trade			1
while still the largest consumer of fuel , the rise of cheap crude available to domestic refiners has turned the @entity0 into a significant exporter of gasoline and distillate fuels			2
last month , @entity42 surpassed the @entity0 as the largest importer of crude , according to the @entity0 government , as the rise of domestic output cuts the @entity0 dependence on overseas oil			1
' ( the @entity0 ) growth rate is greater than the sum of the growth of the next nine fastest growing countries combined and has covered most of the world 's net demand growth over the past two years , ' @entity50 wrote			1
while the @entity0 trails several other nations for crude oil production and stockpiles imported crude at the @entity62 , pictured , near @entity63 , @entity64 , on the @entity65 , it has ramped up production of shale ' the @entity0 position as the largest oil supplier in the world looks to be secure for many years , ' it added			1
total liquids produced by the @entity0 , which @entity12 defined broadly to include supplies such as crude oil , condensate , natural gas liquids and biofuels , should average 12.1 million bpd in 2013 , pushing it ahead of last year 's no. 1 supplier , @entity5			1
output from the @entity82 state also rose last year , but the gains lagged those from the @entity0 , the consultancy said			0
shale production remains a controversial industry in the @entity0 however , due to fears over the impact on the environment			2
pictured , artist and musician @entity91 at a gas drilling site in @entity93 during an ' @entity94 ' tour of gas drilling sites in @entity97 and @entity93 @entity12 said the increase in oil from shale , which has been centered in areas such as @entity102 in @entity103 and the @entity104 in @entity105 , has seen @entity0 supply grow by 1 million bpd in 2012 and again 2013			2
the @entity0 still lagged both @entity5 and @entity108 in production of just crude oil by abut 3 million bpd , @entity12 noted			2
rounding out the top 10 oil suppliers were @entity42 , @entity113 , @entity114 , @entity115 , @entity116 , @entity117 , and @entity118			0
fracking involves injecting a mixture of water , sand and chemicals into the ground at high pressure to crack shale rock holding oil and gas reserves deep underground			0
it generates around 43 per cent of oil and 67 per cent of the current natural gas production in the @entity0			1
first , engineers drill down through up to 10,000 feet of earth to reach a shallow layer of shale			0
they then turn their drills sideways to bore thousands of feet horizontally then vast amounts of sand and chemicals are pumped into the hole under high pressure - a technique called hydraulic fracturing - which creates fissures in the shale			0
the fissures allow the gas locked in the shale to escape back along the pipe and up the well to the surface			0
fracking in the @entity0 first began in 1949			0
according to the @entity0 @entity151 as of 2013 at least 2million oil and gas wells in the @entity0 had been hydraulically fractured			2
concerns there are fears , however , that toxic chemicals used in fracking may contaminate underground water supplies , a problem which will only grow as fracking proliferates , environmentalists warn			0
case studies have shown that residents living near some fracking sites can ignite water that comes out of their taps			0
tests in @entity167 found high levels of methane , ethane , diesel and phenol in water supplies which could have been caused by nearby fracking			0
concerns also surround increases in earth tremors , believed to be caused by injecting fluid at high pressure into geological structures .			0

@entity0 oil output has surged in last four years overtaking the world leader
total oil supplies include natural gas liquids , crude and biofuels
ramping up of shale production played major part in output surge
@entity0 is world 's largest fuel consumer , but @entity42 is biggest crude importer
