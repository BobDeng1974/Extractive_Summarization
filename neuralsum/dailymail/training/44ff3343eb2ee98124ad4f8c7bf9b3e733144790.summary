an 11 - year - old with severe tinnitus is finally able to get a good night ’s sleep after discovering listening to birds relieves his symptoms			1
@entity5 has suffered from the condition - which leaves him with a constant high - pitched ringing in his ears - since he was a toddler			1
every night the noise kept him awake for hours and left him tired and groggy in the morning			1
@entity5 ( pictured with his mother , @entity9 ) has had tinnitus since he was a toddler and struggled to sleep because the ringing in his ears disturbed him but scientists at @entity13 , in @entity14 , have developed a special birdsong box which drowns out the noise , helping @entity5 to finally get some rest			1
his mother @entity9 , 36 , said since putting the recording in his bedroom @entity5 has become ‘ a much happier little boy ’			1
she said : ‘ when he was little @entity5 was very sensitive to loud or unusual noises , would wake frequently , crying in the night and he used to hold a pillow to his ear			1
‘ at first we thought it was an ear infection or something he ’d eventually grow out of			2
but it just seemed to get worse as he got older			0
dr @entity28 ( right ) , at @entity13 , gave @entity5 a ' bird box ' ( left ) which plays recordings of birds singing			1
this gives his brain something other than the tinnitus to focus on meaning it is easier for him to sleep ‘ before the bird box , he would just lie in bed just listening to the screeching for hours on end			1
it ’s so worrying as parents seeing your son like that			0
‘ but now he actually looks forward to going to bed , which was unheard of			0
it ’s given him extra life			0
tinnitus is a term that describes any sound a person can hear from inside their body			2
it is often described as a ringing in the ears but the sounds that can be heard include buzzing , humming , grinding and hissing			1
sometimes the sound beats in time with the person 's pulse			0
the condition can cause sleeping problems and depression but , in itself , it is not harmful			0
the underlying cause is not known but it can be caused by earwax , an ear infection , stress , a head injury or exposure to loud noise			0
there is no single cure for tinnitus but sometimes it can be addressed by treating the underlying cause - for example , through removing earwax build - ups			2
tinnitus is often worse in quite environments so some people benefit from listening to soothing sounds , such as the sound of the ocean			2
the condition is most common in people over the age of 65 but it can affect people of all ages			0
about 10 per cent of the population are thought to have the condition , though most have it mildly			0
source : @entity92 ‘ he ’s got so much more energy and his schoolwork has really improved			0
‘ after using it , he was able to sleep through the night for the first time in 11 years			1
’ @entity5 , from @entity98 , @entity99 , was referred to @entity100 ’s by his gp			1
at the hospital he met hearing specialist dr @entity28 who prescribed the sound box			0
the device is a small box with a digital recording of common garden birds singing which @entity5 can play and control as he wants			1
he has also been taught techniques to help manage the condition , like focusing on a particular sound so that his brain learns to ignore the tinnitus			1
@entity5 said : ‘ it ’s very high pitched and it ’s always the same noise			1
it ’s very annoying but most of the time i ignore it			0
‘ but there ’s no other sounds at night , so i used to just lie there listening to it			2
‘ now i turn on my bird box and i can get to sleep			1
i do n’t have to listen to the noise at night anymore - it really helps			2
i ’m so happy it ’s working			0
’ tinnitus is the sensation of a sound in the ear , often a hissing , whooshing or ringing noise			2
there is no known cure for the condition			0
it is not common in children , but experts are reporting a steady increase in the number of youngsters with the condition			0
medics still do n’t know what causes tinnitus			2
there are some contributing factors like ageing , earwax , respiratory and ear infections , exposure to loud noise and high blood pressure but the underlying cause is often unknown			0
@entity5 ( pictured with his mother , @entity9 ) says he has now had the first good nights ' sleep of his life and his mother says his school work has improved dramatically as a result dr @entity28 said : ‘ a third of people i see have some hearing loss and tinnitus is strongly associated with that			1
‘ in another third of cases , the tinnitus appears to have started at a time of great stress , bereavement , redundancy , illness , or some other major life event			2
‘ in another third we do n’t know the specific cause			0

@entity5 has heard ringing in his ears since he was a toddler
it kept him awake at night meaning he was always tired
*doctors* gave him a recording of birds singing which he can play at night
this allows him to sleep as the bird song gives his brain something to focus on other than the tinnitus
