@entity11 's owner @entity10 said that ms @entity4 tried to shoo the wildebeest away harmlessly when it attacked her			1
he told @entity24 : ' i radioed her and said i saw the lady so @entity27 said , " well , i 'll just bring them down in my car			0
" ' so she brought them down and when she got out of the car she was walking the kids to the wagon			0
the wildebeest came over and she shooed it			0
' however , the wildebeest reacted violently and attacked ms @entity4 , who works as a book keeper at the zoo			1
mr @entity10 said : ' she hit [ the ] ground , it picked her up again and threw her up in the air , and i was getting off the tractor at the time and i ran and got between her and the wildebeest			2
' it happened because she got out of her car and i guess for that matter , it could have happened to the mother and child ? oh yes , yes			0
' mr @entity10 said it was the first time that anyone had been attacked while at the park			0
@entity51 , where ms @entity4 was attacked is just north of @entity52 in @entity9 @entity3			1
