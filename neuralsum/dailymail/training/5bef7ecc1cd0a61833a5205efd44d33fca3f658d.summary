the eyes of a turkey are not the most obvious place to look for sadness , empathy and pride			0
but these moving images show the dignified twilights of farm animals who made it through most of their natural lifespan to reach old age			1
the selection of images , showing animals as young as five and as old as 33 , were taken taken by photographer @entity17 , and often involved spending hours with the animals before they would be comfortable enough with her to pose for the photographs			1
her project , which was also compiled into a video , was dreamed up as a way to cope with the deaths of her grandmother and mother , who both suffered from dementia			0
she said : ' i am creating these photographs in order to take an unflinching look at aging and mortality			0
... photographing geriatric animals enables me to immerse myself in my fear of growing old			1
i have come to realize that these images are self - portraits			0
' or at the very least , they are manifestations of my fears and hopes about what i will be like when i am old			0
@entity51 is @entity52 , a five - year - old turkey , and right in @entity54 a 28 - year - old @entity56 horse deep : the animals depicted have a steady gaze and powerful stare in common			2

@entity17 says the images were born of seeing her own grandmother and mother suffer from dementia			2
