it was a strong look for a damp wednesday morning			0
but as @entity3 power - walked her way up the @entity5 this morning in top - to - toe black , she looked every inch the businesswoman on a mission			0
earlier this week the younger @entity3 girl had stepped out in town wearing a rather more relaxed jeans and jumper combo			0
clearly today she meant to make her mark			0
@entity16 of @entity17 's sister , who paid a visit to upmarket @entity19 , dressed to impress in a long - line black @entity21 coat with that 90s nipped - at - the - waist , single - breasted style sister @entity23 seems to like so much too			1
power brunch : @entity3 looked sharp for a morning visit to @entity19 restaurant @entity27 lady in black : @entity3 accessorised her all - black outfit with her monochrome @entity34 tote and £ 151 @entity36 sunglasses underneath was a simple black @entity40 cashmere bell - sleeved shift dress by @entity41 by @entity42 , £ 470 , which she matched to suede @entity45 boots			1
a touch of luxe was brought by her very covetable @entity34 handbag - the £ 795 @entity50 tote , which is , of course , sold out - apologies to avid ( and wealthy ) @entity3 fashion followers			2
a surprise bargain flourish came with @entity3 's necklace , the £ 15 @entity54 from @entity55 , sold out but being reintroduced in a slightly different take later this month			1
it is not clear who @entity3 was meeting today , but given the number of professional pies she has her finger in - newspaper columnist , magazine contributing editor , food writer , author , party planner - it could have been to talk about any one of a thousand ventures			0
yesterday it was revealed that the @entity3 effect was still going strong , after a pair of £ 150 boots she wore twice in january sold out in just 12 hours , just as the @entity34 tote had done before it			2
the suede boots , made by independent @entity80 - based brand @entity79 , disappeared from shelves within a day of @entity3 's appearance in them - and have now attracted a growing waiting list , with more expected in - store on the 24 january			2
what a gem : @entity3 wore the @entity54 statement necklace , @entity55 , £ 15 , which has now sold out - but a similar one will be in store later this month speaking to @entity88 founders @entity89 and @entity90 said : ' it 's an absolute delight to have @entity3 wearing @entity92			1
' @entity93 has always been a popular boot but the impact of @entity3 wearing them has been extraordinary			0
' the boot sold out online in about 12 hours - overnight basically - and nearly half the orders we have taken came from overseas , particularly the @entity99 ' when someone with @entity3 ’s influence is wearing your product it opens up a whole new audience , all over the world			2
' because she dresses in a way that is effortlessly stylish , people find her looks to be very accessible and therefore they trust the brands that she wears			0
bag lady : @entity3 carried the £ 795 @entity50 tote , which also sold out after @entity3 stepped out carrying it old favourite : @entity3 's coat is by @entity115 and cost £ 295 when it was released last season			1
@entity3 was previously spotted wearing the coat last november for an evening event lady who lunches : @entity3 looked chic in navy and white as she spent the afternoon out and about in @entity19 earlier this week - carrying the same @entity34 tote sell out ! @entity3 's bag on the @entity34 website - but bad luck if you want to buy one as the version @entity3 has - the @entity125 - is out of stock			1

*duchess* of @entity17 's sister spent afternoon in @entity19
