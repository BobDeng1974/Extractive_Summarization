an original manuscript containing sir @entity2 's laws of motion is being made publicly available online , along with other historic works by the great scientist			1
@entity6 today published more than 4,000 pages of @entity2 's most important works on a new digital library website			1
they include the scientist 's own annotated copy of @entity13 - and handwritten notes where some of his most famous theories first came to life			1
groundbreaking : this annotated sketch of work on optics by sir @entity2 is among 4,000 pages of his historic documents which have been put online by @entity6 first published in july 1687 , ' @entity13 ' not only contains the laws of motion , but also @entity2 's law of universal gravitation			1
it is widely regarded as one of the most significant works in the history of science			1
over the next few months the university library will upload thousands more pages , making almost the whole of its @entity2 collection available for anyone to view and download			1
work on the @entity37 ( http://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk ) began in 2010 with the @entity2 collection being photographed during last summer			0
up to 200 pages were captured each day , although major conservation work had to be carried out on several manuscripts and notebooks before they could be digitised			2
the programme also aims to upload works by other famous scientists from @entity47 to @entity48			2
prized : sir @entity2 's first edition copy of his @entity13 , widely regarded as one of the most significant works in the history of science the college notebook - used by @entity2 between 1664 and 1665 - contains notes from his reading on mathematics and geometry , showing particularly the influence of @entity60 and @entity61 later the @entity37 will incorporate other collections including the archive of the @entity64 and the papers of @entity47			1
university librarian @entity66 said : ' over the course of six centuries @entity69 's collections have grown from a few dozen volumes into one of the world 's great libraries , with an extraordinary accumulation of books , maps , manuscripts and journals			2
the college notebook also shows evidence of @entity2 's own mathematical thinking including his study of infinite series and development of binomial theorem and the evolution of the differential calculus ' these cover every conceivable aspect of human endeavour , spanning most of the world 's cultural traditions			2
' digitisation of the @entity2 papers was made possible by a Â£ 1.5million gift from the @entity98 , which supports education and the arts			0
@entity101 , digitisation manager at the @entity69 , said : ' we are launching our collections to the world with perhaps some of the most important papers and documents in the history of science			0
genius : but not all of @entity2 's peers would have wanted his work being made public as some critics felt they were n't even worth being printed ' in addition to his @entity13 and notebooks , we 've included his ' @entity116 ' - a very large notebook @entity2 inherited from his stepfather and filled with notes and calculations when he was forced to leave his studies in @entity6 during the @entity122			1
' with plenty of time and paper to hand , @entity2 was able to make significant breakthroughs , particularly in his understanding of calculus			0
' anyone , wherever they are , can see at the click of a mouse how @entity2 worked and how he went about developing his theories and experiments			0
' @entity2 's copy of his @entity13 shows how methodically he worked through his text ; marking alterations , crossing out and annotating his work in preparation for the second edition			1
' before today , anyone who wanted to see these things had to come to @entity6			0
now we 're bringing @entity69 to the world			0
' @entity2 's @entity145 is recognisably different from our own , but his maths - building on work done by @entity61 - is exactly the same as what mathematicians use today			0
here , he describes the curve of a mathematical function @entity2 's ' @entity116 ' contains much of the mathematician 's work on calculus - which he began in 1664 while away from @entity6 due to the plague not all of @entity2 's peers would have approved of the work being shared so openly			0
several manuscripts contain the words ' not fit to be printed ' hand - written by @entity163 fellow @entity162 , who was asked to go through @entity2 's papers after his death and decide which ones should be published .			0
