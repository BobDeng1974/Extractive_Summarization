with production credits that include @entity4 blockbusters such as @entity5 and @entity6 , to much - loved @entity8 tv series such as @entity9 , a small @entity1 business has celebrated another year as the world 's most sought - after expert in fake snow			1
@entity14 's company @entity13 , which he founded 31 years ago , specialises in delivering more than 300 varieties of snow - both real and artificial - for the world 's biggest film and tv productions			1
his innovations in snow that is suitable for massive film crews and fictional situations has made his company @entity4 's first port of call for winter creations when the on screen temperature drops and they ca n't wait on the weather			1
a frosty looking scene in @entity32 , created with the help of @entity1 company @entity13 a still picture taken from the production of @entity36 , in which mr @entity38 's company was used to make the animals and creatures appear frozen the company also created the breezy snowflakes which feature in the opening battle scene of @entity44 , directed by @entity45 a scene from the tv series @entity48 helped create - showing soldiers walking through a frozen town during the @entity51 @entity53 movie ( pictured ) was particularly challenging because of the sheer scale of snow required for the production			1
the film depicts earth during an apocalyptic climate event mr @entity38 started out 31 years ago supplying old newspapers for the film @entity62			0
he said : ' in our first year of trading we turned over Â£ 958 which was n't a lot and we 're now in 25 countries , including places like @entity69 , @entity70 and @entity71 , but also places like @entity72			2
' he states the service is ' all down to continuity '			0
a week spent in fake artificial snow was not going to make cast and crew sick , nor turn to slush due to hundreds of people tramping over it days on end			1
the company also provides snow very specific to what is needed			1
' @entity85 - that was quite a challenge - just the scale of the snow			2
then you get things like @entity90 , when they wanted really amazing ice shapes and special features , so again that 's a challenge			2
when we did the @entity97 movies , we 'd never worked with actors six inches high before			0
' everything we do is a challenge			0
' the artificial snow is created from ingredients such as paper , wood pulp , starch , polymer and biodegradable plastic , while real snow can be customised to appear , for example , as light snowflakes , or a thick and heavy downfall			1
the @entity112 of films also utilised @entity13			1
pictured in a scene from @entity115 a picture taken from the production of @entity118 , in which the company 's snow was used to cover a frosty ship scenes in @entity123 , such as the one pictured , were also filmed using snow supplied by the @entity1 company the @entity129 film @entity127 , starring @entity130 , also hired @entity13 for the car chase scene pictured a scene from the movie @entity133 , which hired @entity13 to recreate a picturesque and chilly afternoon landscape ' we 've got over 300 different types of artificial snow			1
or you can make real snow , that 's kind of a little bit bigger and whiter			2
even when we make real snow - even now , it 's just one kind of snow but we can make it in different varieties			1
' some machines mix nitrogen with water that atomizes with compressed air and that we 'll shoot out like what you see on the ski slopes			0
' normally on a movie set we 'll be using seven different types of snow to achieve what the director wants			2
some will be very white in the background while snows in the foreground will be much better looking close up and will be durable so the actors leave footprints when they walk			0
' other snows might sparkle when the camera goes close to it			0
other snows might be really white so it goes slushy on the paths when cars drive through			0
others bulk up so you have three feet ( deep ) snow a man can fight his way through			2
' he has even used snow that has a tinge of yellow - so it did n't make a white fridge being advertised appear off - coloured			0
however the 31 years spent perfecting the different types of snow were not always easy			0
' there were mistakes , there was trial and error and there were alleyways			0
we 've had the whole gambit			0
we 've invested lots and lots of money on things that have come to absolutely nothing then we 've invested in something that came to be the best thing ever			0
' we have to understand what the customer expects and then you have to deliver			0
when a director says " i want snow " , you have to start a conversation and say : " well , what snow do you need ? " ' @entity13 also works on advertisements and live events			1
pictured is a @entity210 advertisement staff from @entity13 celebrating the year 's success			1
