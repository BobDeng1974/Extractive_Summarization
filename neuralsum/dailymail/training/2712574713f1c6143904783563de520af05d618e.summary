by @entity0 breast cancer sufferers are to be denied a new ' wonder ' drug that has been proven to extend life by six months			0
rationing watchdog @entity4 is set to block routine use of the medicine on the @entity8 for those with the most aggressive form of the disease on the grounds of cost			1
known as @entity15 or @entity15 , it is the first treatment that can destroy cancerous cells while sparing healthy tissue			1
breast cancer victims have been denied new ' wonder ' drug that can extend life by six months			0
pictured here is a patient having a breast scan in hospital as a result , it dramatically reduces the traumatic side - effects usually associated with chemotherapy , including hair loss			1
up to 1,500 women a year in @entity31 with advanced her - 2 positive breast cancer could benefit			2
the medicine , which costs £ 6,000 a month , will be the eighth breast cancer treatment turned down by @entity4 because of cost since 2011			1
it says the £ 90,000 bill for treating a patient over 15 months is simply too great			0
@entity4 's decision was attacked by a cancer sufferer who claims it has extended her life by more than two years			1
@entity43 , 44 , who was given six months to live in 2011 , said she is now living a normal life with her partner and two sons , taking holidays and working part time			0
' it 's a wonder drug as far as i 'm concerned , ' she said			0
' you would n't know that i am ill. i 'm devastated to think that women in my position might be denied it in future			0
' @entity15 combines @entity56 , another breast cancer drug , with a potent chemotherapy agent which acts only when it reaches cancer cells			2
it blocks signals that encourage the cancer to spread , and breaches the tumour 's outer defences , allowing it to be destroyed from within			0
because its action is so precise , healthy tissue is spared from unnecessary damage , while the cancer is delayed from returning and side - effects are significantly reduced			1
trial results show it provides on average six months ' extra life , but some women having once - monthly infusions are living far longer			2
professor @entity78 , professor of cancer medicine at @entity79 and lead triallist for the drug in the @entity31 , said the @entity4 draft guidance was a ' huge blow ' because it could revolutionise cancer care			1
' for the first time in 20 years as a consultant i 'm seeing people with advanced disease taking an effective drug with little toxicity , ' he said			0
@entity4 is currently consulting on draft guidance recommending the drug is not transferred to the @entity8 budget			1
whatever the outcome , patients in @entity96 can apply to get it from the @entity99 , set up to fund medicines not routinely available on the @entity8			1
but the fund does not operate elsewhere in the @entity31 , and it is due to be wound up in 2016			0
dr @entity103 , of charity @entity104 , said : ' the drug appraisal process in @entity96 , and the cost of drugs , must change if prospects for patients are going to improve			0
' sir @entity109 , @entity4 chief executive , said he hoped @entity110 , which makes the drug , would use the consultation period to consider if there was more it could do			2
he said : ' we had hoped @entity110 would have recognised the challenge the @entity8 faces in managing the adoption of expensive new treatments by reducing the cost of @entity15 to the @entity8			2

@entity4 is set to block routine use of the medicine on the @entity8
it can destroy cancerous cells while sparing healthy tissue
as a result , it dramatically reduces side - effects of chemotherapy
