just hours after his top secret summit with the next @entity3 manager @entity2 in @entity4 , @entity0 was back at @entity5 to cast his eye over the club 's next generation of talent			1
@entity3 's class of ' 14 were in action against @entity12 in the final of the @entity14 , but @entity0 's long day ended in disappointment as they went down 2 - 1			1
he pulled off an outstanding save early on to push away a rasping shot from @entity12 's @entity43 but his positioning could have been better when @entity45 flashed in the equaliser on 22 minutes			1
@entity39 is n't likely to be going anywhere soon and is actually younger than @entity34			0
needs to head off on loan again next season , like he did at @entity51 in the first half of this campaign , otherwise he 's going to be starved of match time			0
understudy : @entity34 is third - choice goalkeeper at @entity3 behind @entity39 and @entity40 @entity56 ( defender ) an enterprising performance at right - back from the @entity60 , who is n't shy in getting forward in support of the attack as is expected at @entity3			2
gave @entity64 all kinds of problems with his twisting runs and trickery during the first - half and was then pushed further forward			2
deserves to be elevated to the first - team squad though and can provide competition for @entity73 as his game becomes more mature			2
all action : @entity56 hurdles the challenge of @entity12 's @entity45 during an energetic and enterprising performance @entity78 ( defender ) the centre - back only graduated to the under - 21 team during the latter part of the season and so is n't fully established at this standard			1
like his fellow defenders , was a little stand - offish when @entity12 attacked with pace and perhaps could have done better in closing down @entity45 and @entity43 for the two goals			1
showed attacking credentials when nearly winning a penalty just before the interval			0
will improve with another year at under - 21 level			1
surrounded : @entity78 takes on @entity12 's @entity64 during the @entity5 final @entity25 ( defender ) an @entity102 regular and fairly experienced after loan spells in the @entity98 with @entity99 , @entity100 and @entity101 , it 's a big year ahead for @entity25			1
with the departures of @entity105 and @entity106 leaving a vacuum at the heart of @entity3 's defence , a few solid performances could propel him into the first team on a regular basis			0
not the finished article , but there is a case for giving the 21 - year - old an opportunity to prove himself			2
@entity117 ( defender ) like @entity56 , showed a willingness to push forward on the left - side but also found himself pinned further back after half - time when @entity3 needed impetus			0
his loan spell at @entity125 early this season was blighted by a thigh injury , though he recovered to become an under - 21 regular after @entity128			1
likely to be sent out on loan for experience again when the new season comes round			0
replaced by @entity132 after tiring late on			0
hands on : @entity3 captain @entity117 seen here challenging @entity135 's @entity134 in the semi-final @entity137 ( @entity138 ) probably @entity3 's greatest threat in the second half , @entity137 was prepared to run at the @entity12 defence and covered plenty of ground up and down the right touchline			2
at just 18 , he has time on his side and will inevitably feature in more under - 21 matches for @entity3 next season			1
@entity0 and @entity2 will keep an eye on his progress			1
willing : @entity137 covered plenty of ground on the right flank as he tried to inspire @entity3 in attack @entity153 ( @entity138 ) the @entity154 was up against two very talented @entity12 midfielders in @entity156 and @entity43 but was n't fazed and showed a willingness to get stuck in			2
this was best demonstrated when he clattered @entity159 and earned a booking just before half - time			0
his season in the under - 21s was also punctuated by a spell at @entity125 , though he only got on the field four times			0
another spell in the @entity168 seems likely next season			0
sandwiched : @entity153 tries to manoeuvre between @entity159 and @entity170 @entity171 ( @entity138 ) @entity173 - born midfielder who has drawn inevitable comparisons with @entity175			1
featured heavily for the under - 21s and in the @entity177 this season and put in a decent shift against @entity12			1
will continue with the under - 21s for another season and could be worth a look in the @entity183			0
on the move : @entity185 leaves @entity64 flat on his back as he breaks forward @entity187 ( @entity138 ) it was a disappointing night for @entity187 as he struggled to inspire the @entity3 attack			0
he would have hoped to create a continuous stream of chances but openings proved few and far between , especially in the second - half			0
he is tipped for big things and is clearly capable , but he wo n't be stepping up to the first team anytime soon			0
another year of experience for the 18 - year - old in the youth competitions will increase his influence on games			0
quiet night : @entity187 was unable to provide forward thrust for @entity3 @entity202 ( forward ) @entity3 's stand - out player in the first - half , especially with a nicely - taken goal early on , but lost his cutting edge after the break when often forced to take the @entity12 defence all by himself			1
when @entity202 turned his man to curl home @entity3 's goal on 12 minutes and when he marauded down the wing early on , you could have closed your eyes and imagined it was a young @entity0 with the no 11 shirt on			1
@entity0 would have been impressed watching on in the stands and will be willing to give him first team opportunities next season			2
@entity202 sadly was n't able to maintain his performance after half - time and lost two one - on - one battles with the quick @entity170 when he could have been clear			2
was ultimately replaced by @entity224 and appeared to be carrying a knock			0
did enough to impress though			0
on target : @entity202 capped a good display with the opening goal , a well - taken curling effort @entity24 ( forward ) the 18 - year - old lived out many a @entity3 fan 's dream when he scored twice on debut against @entity235 last week , but he was off the pace for the most part here as he struggled along while clearly carrying a hamstring injury			1
he showed good awareness to set up @entity202 for the goal but otherwise could n't carve out any chances			2
in the end , he limped off for the lively @entity243 with a quarter of the match left			0
@entity24 will be in and around the first team next season having shown his potential already and could make an effective impact sub for @entity0 and @entity18			1
leading the line : @entity24 intercepts a pass from @entity12 defender @entity251			1

@entity0 watched under - 21 final defeat to @entity12 *alongside* @entity175
came just hours after @entity2 offered him *assistant* manager role
@entity202 caught the eye with well - taken early goal
highly - rated striker @entity24 limped off with hamstring injury
