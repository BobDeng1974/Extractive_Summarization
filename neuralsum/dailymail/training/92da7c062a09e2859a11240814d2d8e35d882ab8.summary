amish mafia revealed by @entity2 reality show of the same name focuses on @entity5 and his three ‘ foot soldiers ’ who carry out his dirty work ' @entity10 ' deals with adultery , extortion , accidents , and financial issues within close - knit religious community within the rolling hills of rural @entity19 , sects of @entity17 live out a seemingly modest existence , caring for their families and living lives of deep religious significance			1
but beneath the veil of their seemingly idyllic lifestyle lies something much more sinister – an @entity17 mafia , which serves as vigilante justice for the community and exposes infidelity , blackmail , and extortion plots			1
the provocative information has been revealed by @entity2 's upcoming reality show , ' @entity10 , ' which focuses around the organization 's leader and his three henchmen			1
a secretive group of @entity17 mafia have been unveiled by @entity41 a new reality show @entity5 @entity5 , left , is the @entity17 insider who holds the power and serves as protector of the community - for a price			1
they are seen busting an @entity17 bishop out for motel sex and have no tolerance for infidelity either in one scene from the pilot episode , two ' mafia ' members stake out a prominent @entity17 bishop who was asking a taxi driver to take him to see a prostitute			2
the two men barge in on the bishop , camera in hand , to get photographic evidence of the bishop 's sin			0
they then kindly let the woman cover up before letting her go on her way			0
while an @entity17 woman explains the conservative traditions of the lifestyle – long dresses , muted colors , no being photographed , no complicated machinery – a man loads a machine gun			0
this is the world of @entity5 , a mennonite who was never baptized , and therefore never a member of the church			1
because of this , @entity5 is able to live in both communities , living amongst his people but also seeing that his idea of justice is served			1
@entity5 , a mennonite was never baptized and therefore never a member of the church			1
he is able to live in both communities , living amongst his people but also seeing that his @entity89 of justice is served ' @entity5 is a man who straddles both worlds , ' the show 's executive producer , @entity90 , explained to the @entity93 earlier this month			1
' he genuinely feels as though he is a help to the community , and yet he has a propensity for violence and intimidation			2
' she said that it took she and others two years to gain the trust of the elusive vigilantes			0
@entity104 is most noted for her production work on reality shows like ' @entity107 , ' ' @entity108 , ' and ' @entity109			1
' she was not immediately available to speak with @entity111 , a @entity2 representative said			1
the show opens with an ominous disclaimer , which reads : ' @entity114 denies the existence of the @entity10			1
to ensure the safety of innocent @entity17 , select re-enactments of events must be used			0
' the show depicts the gang as a violent crew , although they are still religious in their peace - loving church			1
the @entity17 church denies the mafia exists at all because the @entity10 does n't have direct dealing with the church , they do not have to operate within its jurisdiction			1
they use cell phones , drive @entity130 , and tote guns to carry out what they believe is the law			2
@entity135 , a mennonite , is described as ' military foot soldier ' in the pilot episode , set to air december 12			2
many @entity17 sects are wary of ' @entity142 ' laws , and will not report crimes to recognized authority figures			0
that leaves it to @entity5 and his cronies to seek justice for the meek and the mild			1
the @entity136 division is slightly less strict than many @entity17 sects , which the show says allows him to do @entity5 's ' dirty work			1
' in addition , @entity5 and his three mafia members – @entity155 , @entity135 , and @entity156 – can not be punished by church elders			1
their philosophy is an @entity89 , a tooth for a tooth			0
in the case of a woman whose buggy was destroyed by a reckless driver , @entity135 took the matter into his own hands			0
he tracked the man who hit the @entity17 woman 's buggy and fired a single shot through the empty car 's window			0
some scenes - and body art - is more reminiscent of @entity177 than depictions of the @entity17 previously shown in popular culture the owner was unharmed , but the message was clear			2
another time , @entity5 sent @entity155 and @entity135 to stake out the house of a married @entity17 woman who was believed to have had an affair			1
the man was trying to extort the married woman to have sex with him , because her own husband had left her , causing financial struggle			2
divorce is forbidden within the community , and a spouse must wait until their partner dies before re-marrying			2
@entity155 and @entity135 stopped the man , who was driving his buggy down the road , and confronted him on the street			0
' you will not go back there , ' @entity135 said			0
' @entity5 will kick your a * *			1
' the two saw to it that the woman would be supported from funds from @entity5			1
the pilot does not explain why the gang are comfortable using modern conveniences like automobiles , cell phones , and cameras , which are typically shunned but these men still have to answer to the local jurisdictions			0
the @entity216 did not offer any comment regarding @entity5 's criminal record			1
@entity5 is pictured in a 2009 mug shot			1
though his charge and other vital information has been blackened out , @entity5 entered a guilty plea for his crime			1
another case from 2007 shows he negotiated another guilty plea for five separate charges			0
@entity5 oversees the community 's insurance , known as ' @entity229 , ' but is also in charge of the community 's finances and keeping the general peace			1
his three ' soldiers ' also have lengthy criminal records			2
@entity111 's request for comment to the @entity238 to confirm their records was not immediately returned			0
there is no explanation in the pilot as to why @entity5 and his gang are comfortable using modern conveniences like automobiles , cell phones , and cameras , which are typically shunned by conservative practicing mennonites			2
in fact , a disclaimer at the beginning admits that some of the show is actually reenactments - done to protect the identities of innocent @entity17 it is also unclear why various members of the @entity17 and @entity136 communities agreed to be on camera , as it goes against their beliefs of appearing vain			2
some local @entity19 residents with deep interest in the @entity136 and @entity17 communities said that they had never heard of such a thing as the @entity17 mafia			0
' my own view is this is trash tv , ' @entity268 professor @entity267 told @entity271			0
' to call these shows documentaries is a fraudulent lie			0
' @entity267 has been a top researcher on the @entity17 's way of life			0
' there is big money to be had , ' he continued , ' and they pay these people big money to be on the show			0
' he told @entity271 that some members of the community have indeed been charged with crimes , but that going so far as to say there is a vigilante mafia is overboard			2
' i 'm not saying @entity17 are perfect saints and walk on water , ' he continued			0
' but this [ show ] is a twisted portrayal of the @entity17 community			2
' @entity294 district attorney @entity293 added that to his knowledge , there has not been a spike of crime in the @entity300 community in reason years			0
the show comes on the heels of @entity305 's ' @entity304 , ' which has come under fire for deceiving viewers about the five @entity17 and @entity136 men and women it featured as they moved to @entity310			0
in the finale , cast members were given the opportunity to come clean over their questionably @entity17 lifestyles – which , before the show , included modeling careers , skimpy clothes , divorce , and arrests			0
however , many of them touted the fact that they were anything else but normal			0
@entity10 premieres on @entity2 on december 12 at 9pm est. watch the trailer for @entity2 's ' @entity10 '			1
