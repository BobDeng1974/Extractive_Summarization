here , @entity23 tells one nominee ’s story ... @entity26 believes the word ' hero ' is n't an adequate accolade for the doctor she feels gave her back her life			1
' he was almost warrior - like , ' she says			2
' he did n't pity me as some hopeless case			2
he made it clear he was taking my cancer on			1
' and take it on he did			2
three years later , thanks to the tireless compassion of professor @entity41 , from the @entity42 , @entity26 is still alive			1

@entity26 with dr @entity41 - for whom she has voted in the @entity50 awards - at his @entity54 practice the pair met in august 2010			1
@entity26 , a lawyer for an investment bank , had been busy preparing for her wedding day in two months ' @entity58 then a routine check - up brought all her plans to a terrible halt			1
@entity26 was told the breast cancer she thought she 'd beaten three years earlier had not only returned , but had now spread to her liver and bones			1
' the consultant said i probably had less than two years left to live , ' says the 33 - year - old from @entity14			2
one minute i was planning my life , the next i was facing the prospect of dying			1
' i felt like in the doctors ' eyes i was a lost cause			2
my fiance , @entity72 , was with me and afterwards we just clung to each other			1
' fast forward three years and @entity26 is happily married and continuing to work full - time			1

' the timing was awful , ' she says			2
' the oncologist i usually saw was on holiday			2
not only was i going to die , but the person who might be able to buy me a little time through treatment was n't even there			2
' @entity26 was given two years to live by doctors when her breast cancer spread to her liver and bones , then she met professor @entity41 who she believes saved her life seeing her so upset , one of the doctors told @entity26 about professor @entity41 , a leading oncologist who had a reputation for ' never giving up ' , and rang him on her behalf			1
half an hour later they were talking on the phone			2
' i will never , ever forget that phone call			2
this calm , reassuring voice said : " forget two years			0
" ' he made me feel like i was back in control			0
it was so different from the way i had been spoken to before			0

' i was blown away by his determination to give me my life back , he insisted i carry on as normal			1
it was as if cancer was an irritation that would have to fit round my life ' ' what makes him such an outstanding doctor - and human being - is he has always seen me as a real person			1
not just doing the job , saving a life , but recognising medicine is about giving the patient the strength to go on			1
' i can text him any time about the most trivial things - recently i wanted to know if i could get an eyebrow tattoo since i have lost mine permanently as a result of the chemo			0
i was worried it might get infected but he came back to me to say there 'd be no problem			0
it was n't vital but it mattered to me , and when you have cancer , the little things that can boost self - esteem are vital			1
' when it came to her treatment - a combination of hormonal therapy , chemotherapy and other drugs - he 's involved her in every decision , even discussing dosages			0
@entity26 's cancer is , in her words , ' sleeping ' - kept under control with @entity161 , a drug which aims to suppress the cancer 's growth , supplemented once a fortnight by a visit to professor @entity41 , who administers intravenous treatment with chemotherapy and anti-oestrogen drugs			1

the former magazine publisher , 44 , from @entity14 was diagnosed with advanced colon cancer 12 months ago			1

@entity173 says : ' i was devastated			0
i expected to wake up from the operation and the cancer would be gone			1
that 's when i thought i 'd die			2
but one of my doctors got in touch with professor @entity41 and he called that night to say it was going to be fine , that chemo would shrink the tumour			1
he said in this non-negotiable way : “ i can deal with this			0
” ' @entity26 's cancer is , in her words , ' sleeping ' - kept under control with @entity161 , a drug which aims to suppress the cancer 's growth a few days later doctors tried to put a tube into @entity173 's chest for intravenous chemotherapy and burst her lung - it was 9pm on a saturday and professor @entity41 was at home but ' came racing to the hospital to reorganise my care and supervise the pain regime i needed , ' says @entity173			1
' he held my hand and promised me things would be all right			0
you can not imagine what a difference this made			0
i was in pain , terrified , shocked by having failed surgery			0
this man made me feel i was more than just another patient			0
i almost felt i was his only patient			0

professor @entity41 knows i need to be here for my children and he often refers to my boys when he encourages me about the future			1
' i listen to him and i trust him			0
brilliant consultants may be able to perform extraordinary feats of medicine , but i 've never met one who was also such a rare human being			0
' @entity287 , 55 , a businesswoman from @entity288 , first saw professor @entity41 in 2010 when it was discovered her breast cancer had spread to her liver			1
she assumed she was ' finished '			0

' my patients are human beings			0
i want them to live and feel control			0
' the treatment is a mixture of the new , the tried and tested and the groundbreaking			0
it is the tailor - made mix professor @entity41 puzzles and labours over - which may explain his refusal to accept the prognoses of other doctors			1
' but i understand not all of them will make it			0
if this happens , i find it very touching when a family come to me and say they are grateful for the care i gave their loved one despite the outcome			0
' his ambition is simple : ' i want to make cancer feel more like a long - term disease , similar to diabetes , in that if you 're not cured from it then at least you can live with it			2
' for @entity26 , it 's this that makes professor @entity41 a real health hero			1
