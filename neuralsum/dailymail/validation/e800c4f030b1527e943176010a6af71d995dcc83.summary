the new @entity1 season gets underway in the early hours of sunday morning when @entity2 plays host to the opening race of the campaign			1
ahead of the curtain raiser , @entity6 assesses the sport 's hot topics ... so , it looks like @entity11 is going to waltz to back - to - back titles … there ’s no question that @entity15 are set to pick up in 2015 where they left off last year			1
@entity11 and team - mate @entity18 clocked up more miles than any of their rivals over the winter , and they were the quickest , too			1
@entity11 won 11 of the 19 races last year , and you fancy if he sorts out his performances in qualifying , he ’ll be tough to beat			1
@entity11 appeared in a relaxed mood as he signed autographs for punters ahead of the season opener @entity11 ’s popped up at a host of celeb parties over the winter … is there any danger he ’s taken his eye off the ball ? the reigning champion has helped to raise @entity40 ’s profile away from the track after attending a number of showbiz functions during the off - season			1
from the @entity46 catwalk to the red carpet at the @entity48 , @entity11 's never been far from the limelight			2
his high - profile split from @entity51 has hit the headlines , too			0
but the @entity48 , now somewhat of the elder statesman on the grid having celebrated his 30th birthday at the turn of the year , appears to have adopted a new - found maturity in recent times , and his desire to match @entity61 ’s feat of three world titles appears to be his sole focus heading into the new campaign			2
at least , he 's telling us that anyway			0
@entity11 poses in his @entity15 overalls on thursday as he prepares to defend his world championship @entity18 , posing for pictures with fans on thursday , will renew his title battle with team - mate @entity11 so , what can @entity18 do to stop him ? @entity18 out - qualified @entity11 12 - 7 last term , but his race displays left much to be desired ; indeed he converted just three of his 11 poles into victories in 2014			1
if the @entity76 sorts out his race pace , he ’ll give @entity78 a run for his money			0
at 3 - 1 with some bookmakers , he ’s certainly worth a punt			0
and what about the rest of the grid ? @entity86 , powered by @entity15 once more , are set to be @entity11 and @entity18 ’s nearest challengers			1
@entity88 was one of the stand - out performers last term , and his team - mate @entity91 is among the most experienced out there			0
@entity93 , boosted by the arrival of @entity95 from @entity96 , have seemingly turned a corner in pre-season testing and look primed to bounce back from two years in the doldrums			0
@entity100 , the only @entity101 driver to win a race last year , should be confident after a number of impressive displays in 2014 , but his @entity105 - powered @entity96 still lacks what it takes to challenge @entity11 and @entity18 on a consistent basis			1
@entity86 driver @entity88 was among the stand - out performers in 2014 , and he is set to take the challenge to @entity15 once more @entity100 poses with models at the @entity112 ahead of his home race in @entity2 i noticed you have n’t mentioned @entity116 … i thought they were going to be back at the front after renewing their partnership with @entity121 ? well , that was the plan , but it looks as though it will be some time before either @entity125 or @entity126 get a sniff of the podium let alone win a race			1
the @entity131 - based outfit , struck by a host of reliability issues managed fewer miles than any other team in testing and they were well off the pace , too			0
@entity126 , retained by @entity116 after a surprise u-turn from the team 's hierarchy at the end of last year , has already called for patience , and reckons just getting to the finish on sunday , should be considered a positive result			1
@entity126 is set for his 16th season in @entity1 , but @entity116 are likely to struggle from the offset and @entity125 , their marque signing , wo n't be there ? no. the @entity149 suffered a mysterious crash in testing which left him concussed and in hospital for three days			2
@entity153 captured the 134mph smash , but the footage has never been released adding to the mystery surrounding the incident			0
the former @entity93 man is confident he will back for the second race in @entity160 , but his participation is yet to be confirmed by @entity116			2
@entity162 , dropped by the @entity164 team at the end of last year , gets his chance in @entity2 this weekend			0
@entity125 waves to the media after he is released from hospital following a crash in testing with a combined age of 68 , @entity125 and @entity126 form the eldest pairing on the grid , but what about this kid @entity177 ? he is n’t old enough to drive a road car yet is he ? not in his native @entity181 , no. son of @entity182 , the former @entity183 driver and team - mate of @entity185 , @entity180 is just 17			2
he has been partnered at @entity96 's junior team @entity186 with rookie @entity187 , who at the grand old age of 20 is somewhat of a veteran			0
@entity177 will become the youngest driver in @entity1 history on sunday , and it ’s a record which is unlikely to be broken after the @entity193 raised the minimum age limit to 18 in the wake of @entity177 ’s controversial appointment			1
@entity197 ( left ) and @entity187 will form the youngest driver pairing in grand prix history so , what else do i need to look out for this season ? following one of the grandest overhauls of the sport ahead of the last campaign , the rules and regulations are relatively unchanged for 2015			1
ugly nosecones are thankfully a thing of the past , the @entity209 is back on the calendar for the first time in more than two decades , and drivers have been stopped from changing their helmet throughout the season			2
@entity217 are gone , but @entity218 , now in the guise of @entity220 , have survived and after hiring @entity221 , three @entity48 will line up @entity222			0
we ’ll also see the introduction of the ‘ @entity225 ’ ... under new regulations , @entity11 will be forced to stick with the same helmet design ( above ) throughout 2015 what ’s that all about then ? in the wake of @entity232 's horror crash at last year 's @entity233 @entity209 , a ' @entity225 ; concept has been introduced			1
@entity193 race director @entity234 will deploy the system immediately after any incident which requires double waved yellows , but is not deemed severe enough for the @entity225 itself			0
the aim is to neutralise the race track and slow drivers down after @entity232 , who remains unconscious in hospital , was adjudged to have been going too fast when he crashed into the back of a tractor sent to recover @entity246 ’s @entity245 at the rain - lashed race in @entity233			0
so , what time shall i set my alarm for on sunday ? @entity251 and early ! another recommendation following @entity232 ’s crash was to bring forward the start - time of a number of races outside @entity256			2
sunday 's @entity257 @entity209 gets underway at 5am ( 4pm local time ) , one hour earlier than last year , to avoid any danger of the race ending in darkness			1
you can follow the coverage of every lap on @entity265			0
@entity40 will screen the race live with highlights on the @entity268 .			0

@entity11 and @entity18 to renew their title battle in 2015
reigning champ @entity11 starts as championship favourite with @entity15 expected to boast clear *advantage* for second *successive* campaign
@entity116 have endured *difficult* winter and face tough start to the season
