by @entity0 published : 07:36 est , 3 april 2013 updated : 19:06 est , 3 april 2013 returned : @entity1 spent £ 1,000 on a nine - month court case to win back her cat it was a bitter custody fight that took nine agonising months and cost £ 1,000			1
at the heart of it ? a black and white moggy called @entity8			2
the tug - of - love saga began seven years ago after the cat disappeared from @entity1 ’s home			1
the teaching assistant , who had received the week - old kitten as a present two years earlier , searched high and low for her pet and put up missing posters , but to no avail			1
meanwhile , unbeknown to her heartbroken owner , @entity8 had set up home in a greenhouse in the garden of a property a mile away			1
when @entity23 and @entity24 moved into the house in 2007 , they discovered the sleeping cat and assumed she was a stray			1
so the couple fed and cared for her , fitted a cat - flap on the greenhouse and named her ‘ @entity36 ’ in an affectionate reference to the sorry state they found her in			2
fast forward to march last year , however , and a trip to the vet revealed that the cat had a microchip identifying miss @entity1 as her owner			1
she was overjoyed to hear that her pet was safe and well			0
but things changed after she called the @entity43 to thank them for caring for the cat – and they refused to give her back			1
miss @entity1 said : ‘ i got a call from my local vet who said a cat had been brought in and scanned and it was my cat			2
‘ i was amazed , i had given up hope of finding her but i thought it was a miracle she had turned up safe and well			0
' i was given the telephone number of the woman who had cared for her so i phoned her up and said i wanted my cat back and offered to pay her for her trouble			1
‘ she said she was sorry but her husband did n’t agree , they were going to look into their legal rights			0
’ miss @entity1 made inquiries and was advised that a cat remains the property of its original owner unless it is intentionally abandoned			1
back home : @entity1 can finally cuddle her cat @entity8 at their home in @entity70 , @entity71 , seven years after the cat ran away cat fight : @entity74 , pictured in the greenhouse where @entity8 lived for three years , refused to give the cat back to ms @entity1 after discovering she was the owner , but lost custody in court like catnip : brandy the cat is seemingly unaware that she had two women fighting for her love for nine months ‘ luckily , i found a solicitor who had been through the same thing and took on my case , ’ she said			1
‘ it was a huge battle , i felt like i had lost her for a second time			2
’ she launched a civil action at @entity90 and the case was finally settled in january – when , curiously , @entity92 and mrs @entity74 , both 52 , claimed @entity8 had gone missing again			2
a week later , the cat was handed in anonymously to an @entity95 rescue centre before being reunited with miss @entity1 , 42 , at last			2
she said : ‘ i 'm just happy to have her back , it 's incredible			0
she 's still the same cat , she 's very cute although she does n't go out as much now			0
it 's cost me money to get her back but it was worth every penny			0
missing : the poster that went up when @entity8 was lost seven years ago ‘ i have effectively been given custody of @entity8 and i am determined not to lose her again			1
‘ it is just a shame i had to go to court to get her back			2
' the couple who took @entity8 in defended their decision to fight her owner in the courts for custody over the cat , saying they did it ‘ out of love ’			1
@entity23 and @entity24 , both 52 , took the cat in after moving into their home in @entity124 , @entity71 , in 2007			1
the couple , who have three short - haired cats of their own , fed @entity8 who they believed was a stray			1
medical secretary @entity23 , who has two grown - up children , said : ‘ we moved into our house and we were made aware that a cat was living in our greenhouse			2
‘ the neighbours said it was feral and it was in a bad way so i fed her and looked after her and eventually bonded with her			0
i considered her my pet in many ways			0
‘ we paid for her flea powder and food and just accepted her as one of our own			0
' ‘ when i took her to the vet last year when she had a sticky eye i was horrified when they scanned her and said she belonged to a woman living nearby			0
‘ i did n't want to give her up to be honest			0
‘ we 'd given her a good home , good food and plenty of space to run around			0
i did n't feel it was fair on her to be moved again even if @entity1 was her rightful owner			1
‘ we took legal advice because we felt that strongly but in the end our solicitor told us we did n't have a leg to stand on			0
‘ one day the cat went and was handed into the @entity95			0
‘ @entity1 has the cat back but i really wish the cat was back her			1
the greenhouse seems empty without her			0
‘ the fact it went all the way to the courts is ridiculous but i suppose @entity1 and i both loved her and wanted the best for her			0
