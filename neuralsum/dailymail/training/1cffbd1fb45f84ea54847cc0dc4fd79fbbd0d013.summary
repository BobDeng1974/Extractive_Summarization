by @entity1 reporter security company @entity2 has been putting up asylum seekers in four - star hotel rooms because of a shortage of beds in specialist hostels			1
migrants stayed in the £ 100 - a - night four star @entity10 in @entity11 , @entity12 , for over a month			2
far from the prison - like conditions detention centres are famed for , the plush rooms come complete with satellite tv , free broadband and 24 hour room service and guests can use the onsite @entity20 health club			2
security company @entity2 booked more than 400 rooms at the four - star @entity10 , @entity11 , for migrants to stay in after accommodation ran out at specialist hostels more than 400 rooms were booked by @entity2 at the @entity10 and nearby @entity26 between mid-march and late april			1
the company is well - known for its failure to provide enough security staff at the @entity30 and holds the lucrative government contract to accommodate asylum seekers until their applications are decided on			2
and on top of providing half - board , four - star accommodation they failed to tell the police and council of the change as is specified in their contract			1
although the exact cost of the accommodation has not been disclosed , bed , breakfast and an evening meal at the @entity10 can be more than £ 100 - a - night			2
asylum seekers in @entity11 would normally stay at @entity49 in @entity50 which has 250 beds			0
a @entity2 spokesman said : ' we were short of accommodation in the region and they ended up in there			1
i 'm not sure why this hotel was chosen in particular			0
although the exact cost of the accommodation has not been disclosed , bed , breakfast and an evening meal at the @entity10 can be more than £ 100 - a - night ' we 're not obliged to tell the @entity63 we just do it as a courtesy and i do n't know if we did in this case			0
' it was far fewer than 400 rooms and they were only there for a few days			1
i do n't know exactly how many or exactly how long though			0
' any extra expense was born by us though , not the tax payer			0
' the @entity73 said they were aware @entity2 had used a hotel in @entity11 for temporary accommodation for ' a short period of time ' but this had now ended			1
a @entity73 spokesman said : ' the @entity80 has a proud history of granting asylum to those who need it and providing safe and secure accommodation while applications are considered			0
' we continue to consult with our providers and local authorities to monitor existing agreements and ensure that performance levels are sustained , and community cohesion issues assessed			0
