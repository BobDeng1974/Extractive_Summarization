by @entity0 @entity1 , pictured , needed an urgent transplant after her liver turned green and swelled to twice its original size a teenager was left with yellow eyes and a green liver after developing a disease so rare that experts still have no idea what is wrong with her			1
@entity13 , from @entity14 in @entity15 , first noticed a problem when her eyes went a funny hue			1
she went on to visit hospital every week for six months as doctors tried to work out what was wrong			1
medics discovered the 19 - year - old 's liver had swelled to twice its size and turned green , immediately putting the teenager on the transplant list			1
liver specialists , who performed the operation , are still baffled by the mystery illness			1
she said : ' i went to my gp about something else but had noticed my eyes were yellow			1
' the doctor was pretty concerned that i might have hepatitis and did a blood test straight away			0
' i went to a special jaundice clinic where they tried to investigate the most obvious reasons why my eyes might be yellow			1
' when they first mentioned the word " transplant " i was terrified			2
the thought of being operated on freaked me out			0
' because i did n’t really know what was wrong with me i did n’t know if the transplant process would be the same as for other people			1
' finally it was decided that she should be put on the organ donor list - and her listing was backdated six months			2
after first being listed on december 5 , 2013 , she received a phone call on december 29 to say there was a liver waiting			2
the teenager said : ' the caller said an ambulance would be round in an hour to pick me up , but it was there within 10 minutes			0
we actually beat the liver to the hospital in the end			1
' the liver was split - which means i got the large right lobe and a child was given the smaller left lobe			2
they both grow to become fully functioning livers			0
' she was taken to @entity74 , in @entity75 , where the seven - hour operation began at 7am on december 30			2
her liver was green because of all the bile she was n’t managing to process			1
@entity13 remained at @entity81 for 12 days , and then was transferred to @entity82 in @entity14			1
she said : “ the first few days i was n’t allowed to get up and could n’t eat			0
when someone has a split liver they ca n’t eat for four days to protect the connection			2
' when i left hospital it was a case of trying to get my strength back , but it took me a while because i had lost most of my muscle mass and slept so much in hospital			2
' but i realised how lucky i am - i just though that i could be dead - so i ’d better get up and do stuff			0
@entity13 was transferred to @entity82 , pictured , in @entity14 after having her liver transplant			1
doctors say they still do not know what has caused the 19 - year - old 's illness ' i ’ll be on immune support medication for the rest of my life to make sure the liver does n’t reject , and i have just come off steroids which they give younger people to make sure it does n’t reject			1
' i do n’t really know how i managed to get through it all			0
i wanted to protect my family and friends so i tried not to talk too much about it			0
' my friends were 17 when i got ill and i thought that they might not be able to deal with it , but my boyfriend @entity115 got most of my moaning			2
' the 19 - year - old , who will begin a degree at @entity120 in september , said : ' i ’m really looking forward to starting at university - this time last year i did n’t think i would be able to			0
' i got ill just before my 18th birthday so i could n’t go out and have a drink to celebrate			0
' it 's more important to me now to get what i want out of life and not just plod along ' ' but i ’m never going to be able to do that now , which bothers me , but when you put it in perspective it does n’t really matter			0
' @entity13 said the experience had inspired her to make sure she has a successful future and refuses to lead a ' mediocre ' life			1
she said : ' it ’s more important to me now to get what i want out of life and not just plod along			0
i do n’t want to be mediocre anymore			0
' i ’m in the process of writing a letter to thank my donor ’s family and show them that i ’m making the most of it			0
i ’m so thankful - i ’m only alive because of someone else			0
' and a family that are grieving - that they could think of someone else at that time is amazing			0
' @entity151 , 35 , is a liver transplant and @entity154 nurse at @entity82 , and has worked closely with @entity13 throughout her treatment			1
she said : ' it took so long to work out what was wrong with @entity13 basically because she is the first one to have it			1
we still do n’t really know what it is because it ’s so rare			0
' she has been remarkable the way she has dealt with everything , and the donors should be thanked for their gift to people like @entity13			2
