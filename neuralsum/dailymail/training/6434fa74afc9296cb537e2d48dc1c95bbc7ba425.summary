by @entity0 @entity3 supremo @entity2 is in line to be the next chairman of the @entity6 , it emerged last night			2
the former track star and @entity9 chief is the frontrunner to replace @entity10 , who stood down three weeks ago after heart surgery			1
@entity12 refused to comment on the report first made by @entity14 but @entity16 sources last night confirmed @entity17 is the leading candidate			1
@entity16 sources claim that @entity17 , pictured , is the leading contender to replace @entity19 as chairman of the @entity21 @entity23 mayor @entity22 appeared to inadvertently confirm the story when he said that @entity17 was a ‘ first - rate choice ’			1
mr @entity22 said : ‘ i think it ’s fantastic news for the @entity6 and @entity29 broadcasting			1
@entity2 is a great leader , i ’ve worked with him a lot over the last few years and i think he ’ll demand very high standards of the @entity6			2
‘ i think he ’ll be exactly in the right tradition of @entity29 broadcasting			0
’ yesterday lord @entity17 , 57 , did not deny he was linked to the role , saying only that he was ‘ very flattered ’ to be considered a contender			1
he said : ‘ i think you will find that whenever any job at the moment comes up i seem to be slated in for it			2
‘ either the mayor of @entity23 , @entity42 , @entity43			0
i ’m very flattered , thank you , but i ’ve actually just got off a plane			2
i have absolutely nothing more to say			0
’ after @entity10 stood down , it was suggested that @entity48 wanted a woman to fill the role , with dame @entity51 , the former chief executive of @entity54 company @entity52 , heavily tipped			0
lord @entity17 ’s appointment would be popular among @entity17 mps who remain concerned about left - wing bias within the corporation			1
unlike @entity10 , he is seen as a ‘ true @entity17 ’ in his beliefs			1
@entity2 , who is rooted in the real world and renowned for his common sense would be an ' inspirational choice ' @entity17 was a @entity17 mp for five years before losing his seat in the 1997 general election , returning to politics for a short time as @entity67 ’s chief of staff after receiving a life peerage in 2000			1
a double @entity3 gold medallist in the @entity70 , he has also already had a working relationship with @entity6 director - general @entity72			0
in 2009 , @entity72 , then chief executive of the @entity73 , was asked to chair a board to direct the @entity76			0
this gave @entity72 a seat on the board of the @entity80 , which @entity17 chaired			1
lord @entity17 would move into the job following a string of highly damaging scandals at the corporation			1
the @entity6 was lambasted for its handling of the @entity88 scandal that broke after the presenter ’s death in 2011			0
in november 2012 @entity91 quit as director - general after a disastrous @entity94 programme wrongly implicated @entity95 in a child sex abuse scandal			0
the @entity6 has also been criticised after details emerged of shocking payoffs worth tens of millions of pounds to senior @entity6 managers			0
technological changes have also led to question marks about the future of the licence fee			0
the @entity6 ’s royal charter , which secures its funding from the compulsory licence fee , which currently costs £ 145.50 , is up for renewal at the end of 2016			0
as @entity2 , he became a household name in 1980 when he won the 1500 metres olympic gold medal – a feat he repeated at the @entity113 in 1984			0
@entity17 peer @entity10 stood down as @entity21 chairman after three turbulent years in charge			1
he said he could no longer do the job because of ill health his victory over his great rival @entity121 in @entity122 in 1980 is still seen as one of the great @entity3 stories			2
he claimed the gold , crossing the line , arms aloft , only days after losing to @entity121 over 800 metres , which was seen as @entity17 ’s specialism			1
after retiring from athletics , he was elected in 1992 as a @entity17 mp for the @entity132 constituency of @entity133 and @entity134 until his defeat in the 1997 election			2
he was chairman of @entity29 ’s triumphant bid to host the @entity9 , and took the same role in the committee organising the @entity113 , which were widely seen as one of the most successful in recent years			2
the formal selection process for the chair of the @entity6 – for which @entity10 was paid £ 110,000 a year for a three - day week – will be overseen by culture secretary @entity143 .			0

@entity17 peer refuses to deny reports he has been chosen to head @entity21
@entity9 mastermind says he is flattered by reports linking him to job
