an armed officer with a @entity1 on duty when @entity3 , accused of murdering two policewomen , appeared in court three people are shot every day by police armed with 50,000 - volt taser stun guns , figures revealed last night			0
the potentially deadly devices were deployed in almost 4,500 confrontations last year , more than ever before			1
spending on the weapons and their accessories doubled to £ 1.2million and police chiefs are considering whether to extend the availability of the devices even further			1
one chief constable said the murder of two women officers in @entity19 last week throws the use of @entity1 into a ‘ new light ’			1
@entity22 , who leads the @entity24 force , said the weapons are an ‘ obvious ’ alternative to arming more officers with conventional firearms			1
he said : ‘ officers feel the @entity1 gives them an extra bit of protection from some of the circumstances they find themselves in			1
’ police are investigating whether one of the two @entity19 officers may have tried to use a @entity1 to defend herself last week			1
a bright yellow @entity1 was found out of its holster and close to where pcs @entity38 and @entity38 lay			0
debate continues over the merits of the controversial @entity44 - made weapons			0
the potentially deadly devices were deployed in almost 4,500 confrontations last year , more than ever before there are around 12,000 tasers on the streets of @entity48 , mostly used by trained officers			1
the @entity50 , which represents the junior ranks , wants the government to spend millions to increase the number to 36,000 , enough for all officers on duty			1
but critics claim the latest figures reveal a dangerous ‘ arms race ’ is taking place and warned that increased availability could reduce control of their use			1
serious questions have been raised after the weapons were used in incidents involving the mentally ill , elderly and vulnerable			0
the latest figures were revealed in a series of requests to every force across @entity69 and @entity70 under the @entity71			0
one of the weapons was found out of its holster close to the bodies of @entity38 ( left ) , and @entity38 the two police officers murdered in @entity19 they show that @entity1 were deployed at least 4,461 times last year compared with 3,219 times in 2010 , an increase of almost 40 per cent			1
the weapons were fired into suspects at least 1,081 times , an average of almost three occasions every day , compared with 744 times in 2010			0
there were huge variations in how often the weapons were used			0
@entity88 of the list was @entity90 , where they were fired 195 times , and the @entity93 , with 101 times			0
in smaller and rural forces , including @entity98 , @entity99 and @entity100 , the number of discharges remained in single figures			0
meanwhile separate figures showed that forces doubled their spending on the weapons , ammunition and related equipment to more than £ 1.2million a year			2
the sum rose from £ 571,894 in 2009/10 to £ 1,255,483 in 2011/12			0
the true figure is likely to be far higher because the @entity93 , which accounts for around a third of police spending , could not supply any details			0
@entity113 deputy chief constable @entity112 , who has national responsibility for taser use , said the devices have avoided the need for conventional guns in some situations			2
concerns : critics claim the latest figures reveal a dangerous ' arms race ' is taking place and warned that increased availability could reduce control of their use he said : ‘ in more than half of cases , the mere threat of its use has been enough to deter violent individuals and ensure a peaceful resolution of the incident			1
‘ every chief constable makes a decision , based on an assessment of the risks in their own area , to train and deploy a proportionate number of officers to use @entity1 so that the public are kept safe and their officers are protected as far as possible			2
’ but @entity147 said @entity1 should be used only where there is a threat to life or of serious injury and by a restricted number of highly - trained officers			2
a spokesman said : ‘ tasers can be a better option than guns but both in the @entity48 and the @entity44 people have died after being shocked with them			0
‘ @entity147 does n’t want to see the @entity48 hurtling even further down the slippery slope towards arming all officers with @entity1 , or worse towards a situation like that in the @entity44 where they have been widely misused			2
