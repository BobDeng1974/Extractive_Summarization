' we assess that the opposition has not used chemical weapons			2
' @entity150 is a type of nerve gas			0
the report further reveals evidence that the regime had been preparing chemical weapons in the three days prior to the attacks and protected themselves using gas masks			2
' @entity3 chemical weapons personnel were operating in the @entity161 suburb of ' @entity162 from sunday , august 18 until early in the morning on wednesday , august 21 , near an area that the regime uses to mix chemical weapons , including sarin , ' the report says			1
the report also cited evidence that the attacks were launched from regime - controlled areas into opposition territory or contested areas			0
several senior officials related before the release of the report that the intelligence was ' not a slam dunk ' in terms of tying @entity6 's regime to the use of chemical weapons			1
the term ' slam dunk ' is a reference to the then - cia director @entity185 's assurance in 2002 that assessments showing that @entity186 had weapons of mass destruction was a ' slam dunk			0
