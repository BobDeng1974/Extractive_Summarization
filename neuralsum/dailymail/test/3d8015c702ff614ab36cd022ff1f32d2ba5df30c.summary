an apartment house where only high - paying tenants can use the gym may be illegally discriminating , city human rights officials warned this week			1
it 's the latest salvo in an ongoing struggle between property developers to build or maintain rent - stabilized apartments alongside luxury units that go for thousands of dollars more a month			1
other building have installed so - called ' poor doors ' for use by rent - stabilized tenants while full - rent residents get to use the front door			1
@entity17 @entity16 obtained pictures of the sign posted by property managers that warned only certain residents of the building were allowed access to the gym			2
the @entity25 said in a notice filed thursday that there 's enough evidence of age discrimination to merit a hearing on the @entity33 complex 's fitness room			1
the rent - regulated tenants excluded from the gym are largely over 65 , while market - rate tenants are n't , according to a complaint last year from tenants ' association president @entity38			1
she said friday she was hopeful the landlord would now let rent - stabilized tenants pay a reasonable fee to use the gym and have it continue to be free for their higher - rent neighbors			1
@entity38 said tenants previously offered to do that but were rebuffed , spurring her complaint			0
' you really should n't have to do all this to live a happy life , ' said @entity38 , 75 , who has lived in the building since 1972			0
market - rate apartments go for $ 3,500 a month for one - bedroom units , which advertise granite counter tops , stainless steel appliances and close proximity to @entity82			1
the landlord , @entity84 , had no immediate comment friday			0
@entity84 has said the gym was built last winter to entice market - rate tenants			2
' any impact on rent - regulated tenants arises out of their length of tenancy in the building , ' not their age , ' and involves that person 's choice to remain in a rent - regulated unit at lower rent , ' the landlord 's lawyer , @entity88 , wrote in a filing last year			1
the building advertises one - bedroom apartments for $ 3,500 a month that feature granite counter tops and stainless steel appliances while city law prohibits discrimination based on age , it 's silent on the subject of rent - regulation status			1
stabilized tenants get valuable benefits of their own , like lower rent , @entity88 noted			2
the building 's courtyard , laundry room and some other amenities are open to all residents , he added			2
@entity33 is among several @entity16 buildings that have spurred an outcry over separate entrances for lower - paying residents - dubbed ' poor doors ' - or playrooms , roof decks and other amenities reserved for market - rate renters			1
galled by seeing such arrangements in developments that often enjoy tax and zoning breaks for including affordable housing , some officials have sought to require more equal treatment			0
just this week , city councilman @entity133 proposed to require buildings to let affordable housing tenants use amenities			0
public advocate @entity137 and several council members , including @entity133 , supported @entity38 's complaint			0
@entity140 said friday she was heartened by the rights commission 's finding			0
' this will send a clear message : this is really just unacceptable , ' she said by phone			0
' when you stigmatize individuals based their status as rent - regulated tenants , it was just inherently wrong and inconsistent with the general principles that we all hold dear			2
' developers say the arrangements reflect business considerations , not prejudice , and ultimately contribute to more economically integrated environments			0
attracting higher - paying residents with amenities helps make it feasible to incorporate affordable housing in highly desirable areas , according to developers			0
@entity38 , meanwhile , says she 's eager to get into the gym .			0

ruling by the @entity16 @entity25 is a blow for @entity33 on @entity63 's @entity62
*60percent* of the tenants pay *reduced* rent - stabilized rates
the rest pay market rates of $ 3,500 a month for a one bedroom apartment
most rent - stabilized tenants are over age 65
this is the latest battle between property developers who get taxes breaks for building rent - stabilized units and the city
