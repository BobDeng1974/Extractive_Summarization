by @entity0 last updated at 7:48 pm on 27th december 2011 this is the dramatic moment police drew a taser as they battled to gain control of the frenzied crowd surrounding the scene of a fatal stabbing on @entity9 's @entity8 yesterday			1
as hundreds of shoppers look on in horror at paramedics trying to revive the teenager outside a branch of @entity15 , several distressed onlookers appeared to try to push past the line of police			1
and as emotions ran high , officers had to physically restrain a number of youths , including one teen who appeared desperate to push through towards the victim following the @entity26 attack			1
on the video soundtrack , what sounds like the distinctive rattle of the electronic gun can be heard over the shouts of shoppers and police , as the youth gesticulates wildly with officers			1
tragic : the 18 - year - old victim , @entity60 , poses in a grey hoodie in a social networking profile picture the black youth who the @entity3 was aimed at did not appear to be physically harmed by the gun , and he was eventually forced back into the crowd			2
a @entity67 spokesman initially confirmed that an officer had discharged a taser			2
but tonight the @entity70 denied that the weapon was fired in anger			2
responding to the @entity75 footage , commander @entity73 said : ' one of the first units to come across the incident were officers from the @entity70 's @entity79 who were driving past			1
' on arrival they were confronted by certain elements of the crowd who were extremely agitated and officers had to protect the victim and those administering emergency first aid to him			0
' officers can be seen in the footage pushing the crowd back and one officer is shown to remove his taser from its holster , although at no time was it ever deployed			0
' clearly in those initial early stages , officers would have been unaware of what had occurred and where the suspects might be and their priority would have been to prevent further injury or loss of life to those in the area			0
' after police shut off the first crime scene , @entity26 bargain hunters and tourists were going up to the cordon to take pictures and ask officers what had happened			1
shoppers could be seen going in and out of nearby shops , such as @entity114 and @entity115 , but a number of stores were forced to close			0
other officers keeping order at the crime scene have to shove other youths back away from the victim , who lies lifeless on the floor as paramedics try in vain to save his life			1
met police officers can be heard several times on the footage yelling at the assembled crowd to ' get back ' and ' move away ' as the horror unfolds in front of central @entity9 's @entity134 tube station			1
it is thought the 18 - year - old may have been stabbed in a row over a pair of trainers			0
witnesses said the teenager was amongst a group of black youths , thought to be rival gangs , fighting over the trainers at the @entity146 branch on @entity8			1
hours after the murder , police rushed to a second incident near @entity150 – 700 yards from @entity146 – where a young man had been stabbed in the leg			1
at the scene were a bloodied pair of jeans and a pair of @entity158 trainers			2
investigation : part of the road was cordoned off on one of the busiest shopping days of the year after the stabbing fatal stabbing : the scene outside @entity146 on @entity8 where the man was stabbed to death last year , police fired @entity3 over 1,500 times , an average force increase of 130 per cent and 70 per cent up on the previous year			1
the electronic weapons , which are only used by trained firearms officers , send out a 50,000 volt shock from either two darts or by placing the stun gun directly on the body			0
in the year ending march 2011 , some police forces used @entity3 800 per cent more than in the previous year , according to the @entity180 investigation			2
earlier this year the @entity70 said it was considering increasing the number of @entity3 it issues to officers			0
met police commissioner @entity184 said the force was considering having one of the controversial firearms in every police car , so they can be deployed more quickly			2
mr @entity184 had commented last week that fewer people are being tasered by police			1
but @entity192 questioned his comments in light of the figures			0
critics say the electronic stun gun can be fatal and changes the nature of policing			0
police were investigating whether there was any link between the two stabbings			2
detective chief inspector @entity204 , who is leading the murder inquiry , said yesterday : ‘ this is probably the busiest place in the @entity207 right now on the busiest shopping day			0
’ the crimes brought a large area thronged by tens of thousands of shoppers to a standstill and closed many stores			0
@entity67 said @entity8 has today fully reopened to pedestrians , buses and other traffic , while a small crime scene remains in place outside the @entity146 store			1
police commanders had to bring in extra officers to hold back crowds of bargain hunters incensed their spending spree had been interrupted			2
yesterday ’s murder happened at about 1.45pm – the height of the shopping frenzy			0
the sprawling @entity146 store , near @entity134 , was packed with shoppers frantically sifting through piles of sales goods			1
witnesses said a group of young men began arguing over a box of trainers before the victim was stabbed in the chest			0
it is believed the group may have been on @entity8 on a shoplifting spree and were arguing over who stole what			0
one said the killer said ‘ wallah ’ , an @entity249 slang term for ‘ i swear to @entity250 ’ , before plunging the knife into his victim			0
the stabbed youth pushed his way through the crowd of shoppers , many of whom did not realise what had happened , before collapsing on the pavement outside			0
emotions running high : police officers block a member of the victim 's family from getting too close to the scene murder weapon ? a lock knife found at the scene of the stabbing @entity269 : police tape keeps shoppers at bay as police investigate the stabbing			1
