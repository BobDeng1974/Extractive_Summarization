' a lot of things went wrong			2
we are all human beings			2
we all go through a lot at certain time of our lives			2
i think i have learned from it			2
i went through a lot of family issues			2
as i said earlier on , now it is behind me and i am back on the football pitch			1
i am very glad to be back			1
' @entity0 , 31 , returned as a late substitute at @entity52 on sunday , his first appearance for nearly two months , during which he returned to @entity55 to address family problems			1
while he was out 21 - year - old @entity13 has reinforced his position as @entity2 's first - choice striker			1
@entity0 said : ' i 'm very happy and pleased for @entity13 , who has been doing fantastic			1
in football , we all have our moments			2
he is a young lad that came out and at the moment , i think he is the only one that can save our season , like i did the last season			1
' two years ago , it was @entity68			2
so you know , football is always changing			0
i am very happy for him , very pleased for him			0
he is a young lad			0
he is learning through his difficult moment as well but he is fantastic player			1
@entity75 four still possible - @entity76 @entity0 has fallen out of favour with @entity2 boss @entity76 and had been criticised by fans @entity0 had not featured for @entity2 since the end of january in the 2 - 1 @entity81 defeat by @entity22 @entity2 's defeat by @entity5 left them six points adrift of the top four places ' if he keeps scoring two goals every weekend , he can help us into the top four			1
but do n't get me wrong , now people are starting to get to know him and what he can do and what he can not do , his positives and negatives on the pitch			0
' but he is an intelligent lad and he just has to find his way again and bounce back			1
we all have a huge faith and believe in him			0
hopefully , he will drag us out of the top seven and put us in the top four			1
' and for me , sitting on the bench , as a player , i have been there before			0
i just have to work hard on the pitch and come back and play football			1
football is a fun game			0
today , you are zero			0
tomorrow , you are a hero and the most important thing is you , what makes you happy , keep believing , keep doing your thing on the pitch			0
' @entity0 was in demand on transfer deadline day in january , when he rejected a move to @entity113 but almost joined @entity114 before @entity2 chairman @entity115 blocked the loan transfer			1
' that is already behind me , ' said @entity0			1
' i am still at @entity2 so for me , the most important thing is now @entity2 and help the team achieve our target which is to finish in the top four			1
do n't get me wrong , it 's going to be hard but at the moment , just let me focus on my game and how i can help the team			2
@entity0 was given the captain 's armband for the second leg of the @entity129 semi-final against @entity131 in january @entity0 posted this picture to @entity133 days before the @entity5 match , with a message saying it is not important what people think of you , but who you are ' why not ? i am part of the squad			1
and for me , the most important thing â€¦ i 'm not 21 years old any more			0
i am 31 and i look at things differently			0
as i said , i am available			0
we have a lot of fantastic players in the squad and the manager has a choice to make			2
' if i am in , like when i came in for ten minutes i run around , i did what i can do and whenever i am selected , i just have to help my team and show respect for them and show respect for the club			0
' the summer is a long way to go			0
we 've got what , nine games to go ? which is almost two months			0
so we 've got plenty of time			0
at the moment , i 'm a footballer , i 'm a professional ... keep doing my work , keep doing my job as professional as i can			2
at the beginning of the last season , everyone wanted me out ; at the end of the season , they wanted me to stay			0
i just have to keep believing in myself , keeping doing my thing			0
' i travelled to @entity175 to be a footballer and today , i am a footballer			0
already , i am very glad because obviously in my country , only @entity177 knows how many people would love to wear the @entity2 shirt today and play for @entity2			1
so whenever i have a chance to wake up and be alive , i always thank @entity177 for that and for me , all the rest is a bonus			0
keep enjoying my life , keep enjoying myself			0
' @entity0 was booed onto the pitch at @entity52 by travelling @entity2 fans , upset with what they consider a casual attitude and comments made earlier in the season that the team would rather play away than at @entity193			1
@entity0 came close to leaving @entity2 in january but chairman @entity115 blocked a move to @entity114 the striker returned to favour under @entity197 last season and scored 11 goals after january he added : ' i do n't know if i have been punished or not but what i know is , i 'm me , i 'm being me , and if i have to say it and correct the future for the club , i will do it			1
do n't get me wrong , this club has given me the chance to play again in @entity207 and i 'm so grateful			0
' if @entity2 won the cup a few weeks ago , i 'm part of the club that won the @entity211 in 2015			1
@entity2 did n't win it			1
me and the fans are in the same boat			2
so today , obviously , i am very disappointed and i think the fans are disappointed as well			2
at the end of the day , somebody will say something that people will misunderstand and take the wrong way but i have nothing against the fans , i always love the fans			2
' i do n't want to get involved in that any more			0
it 's behind and for me now , it 's just play football and enjoy my life again			0
as a @entity19 boy , who has suffered a lot and today he 's in @entity175			1
as i tell you before , my junior brother , my senior brother , my uncle , i think they would love to be in my position today , being a footballer , being a striker for @entity2 , trust me			1
even just travelling with the team , a lot of my family members , a lot of my countrymen , would love to do that			0
for me , let me just enjoy it and embrace it			0
