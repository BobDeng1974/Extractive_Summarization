@entity0 has been the recipient of private tuition by @entity3 coach @entity2 in a bid to find the net more often , and boy is it paying off			1
so far this season the pair have spent hours together after training perfecting the fine art of finishing ; nobody was more pleased to see @entity0 score the equaliser and his 19th of the campaign to turn this fixture just after the break than @entity17 ’s right - hand man			1
@entity3 fell behind to @entity19 ’s 20th - minute strike , thanks to a terrible mix - up between goalkeeper @entity22 and @entity23 , but their talisman spearheaded a comeback which saw them rise to fourth in the @entity27			1
@entity19 ( left ) celebrates with team - mate @entity28 after he opens the scoring for @entity30 @entity0 ( far left ) equalises for the home side in the 52nd minute with a sublime header @entity33 is overjoyed as his 67th minute goal put @entity3 ahead for the first time in the game @entity0 cleverly flicked beyond @entity37 before @entity33 careered from right back to meet substitute @entity39 ’s cross to head in the winner so , what ’s changed for a striker who previously saw goalscoring as an infrequent hobby rather than a career ? ‘ wonderful management and coaching , ’ @entity17 joked			1
‘ he ’s got the no 9 on the back now			0
he ’s reaping the rewards for working hard - extra training on fridays			0
‘ it would have been a travesty had we lost that one			0
we contrived to give a goal away but deserved it			0
’ @entity30 's @entity60 ( left ) gets physical with @entity3 winger @entity61 @entity3 midfielder @entity62 drives forward with the ball under pressure from @entity65 the age of a £ 5billion @entity67 is still over a year away , but @entity3 are insistent that they will grace it well before then , becoming one of the three top - flight newbies next season			2
monies on offer to promoted clubs remain astronomical next year , of course , and the @entity3 want a piece of those riches			2
when you boast a striker such as @entity0 , that ’s always a distinct possibility			2
@entity0 earlier struck a post ; so too did @entity83 , making his third full debut for the club for whom he began his career , while @entity30 manager @entity88 opted not to speak afterwards .			0

@entity19 fired the *visitors* into the lead in the 20th minute
@entity0 headed in @entity94 's equaliser in the 52nd minute
@entity33 guided in @entity39 's cross to put @entity3 ahead
