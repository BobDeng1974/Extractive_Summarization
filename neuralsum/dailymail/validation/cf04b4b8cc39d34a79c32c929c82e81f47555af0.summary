an 11 - year - old missed out on all the secondary schools she wanted and instead has been offered a place at an academy which was previously in special measures			1
@entity5 , of @entity6 , was one of thousands of children in @entity8 who were left disappointed after they missed out on their first choice secondary school place when they were notified yesterday			1
her parents listed four schools in order of preference for their daughter but missed out on them all			2
instead the 11 - year - old , who is due to start year seven in september , has been offered a place at @entity19 and @entity20			1
the school became an academy last november after it was placed in special measures in 2013 following a damning @entity25 report which rated it ' inadequate '			1
@entity5 's mother @entity27 , 31 , said : ' @entity5 was really engaged in the whole process of deciding what school she wanted to go to			1
she went to look at all the schools			0
@entity5 , 11 , missed out on all four of her choices for @entity6 secondary schools and was instead offered a place at an academy previously in special measures			1
her mother @entity27 is appealing the decision ' we put a white board up in the kitchen and after each open evening she weighed up the pros and cons and gave the school a score out of ten			2
that 's how she decided which schools she would choose			0
' we are not wholly surprised that she did n't get into the university school as it looked so amazing that we were expecting it to be inundated with applicants			0
but we thought she would at least get one of her other choices			0
@entity6 was one of the worst areas where children missed out on their first choices as secondary school places were confirmed yesterday			1
a third of children in the city missed out on their first choice school compared to just two per cent in @entity60			1
councils notified parents of their children 's fate yesterday by email or letter , meaning some families will not receive the news for several days			2
@entity5 was rejected from her first choice @entity70 ( top left ) , which is being built , her second @entity72 ( top right ) , which is closer to her home than the place she has			1
she was refused her third @entity75 ( bottom left ) and her fourth , @entity77 ( bottom right ) the 11 - year - old applied for four schools - three of which were within 2.5 miles of her home but was rejected and given a place at @entity19 and @entity20 which was put into special measures in 2013 ' it is such a worrying time , all we want is the best for our daughter			1
we are going to appeal and fight this all the way			0
' the decision to offer @entity5 a place at the academy came despite the site being further away from her home than her second choice school			1
she was also rejected from @entity95 in @entity96 , despite having a foster sibling already at the school			0
her parents have vowed to appeal the decision			2
they decided to put just four choices on the form instead of take advantage of listing six options because they thought this would be enough			0
they listed @entity107 , @entity108 ; @entity72 , @entity109 ; @entity75 , @entity110 and @entity95 , @entity96 , as their choices			0
@entity5 was rejected from all four of her secondary school choices , despite her second preference being closer to her home and one of her choices being at a school where one of her foster siblings is a pupil she has been offered a place at @entity19 and @entity20 , put in special measures in 2013 the couple 's first choice for their daughter , currently a pupil at @entity127 's @entity126 in @entity109 , was the new @entity107 , which is opening its doors for the first time in september			1
a spokeswoman for the school said it had received a staggering 1,100 applications for its 150 places , with 377 pupils putting it as their first choice			0
@entity5 's parents have been told their daughter is currently in 177th place on the waiting list for a place at the sought - after free school , which is financially backed by the university and which has promised it will provide a private education standard without charging fees			1
the @entity149 intake will consist of 75 pupils living around its site in @entity153 , @entity108 , while another 75 will come from homes near @entity155 , @entity156 and the @entity158 railway stations			0
@entity159 , @entity160 's director of people , said : ' if you have applied for an academy , foundation , grammar , voluntary aided or free school and want to appeal against their decision , then you must contact that school directly for details of their appeal arrangements			2
' under the admissions system , families list their school preferences and are then allocated places according to the schools ’ admissions criteria			0
many children living in big cities were left disappointed yesterday , and this graph shows the percentage of children who got their first choice secondary school when the places were announced on monday factors can include proximity to the school , faith or ability – with some schools specifying how many bright , average and low ability pupils they will admit			1
a spokesman for the council said : ' the school admissions team has processed over 15,000 applications for secondary school places this year			2
parents in @entity6 can submit up to six preferences , including grammar schools , and we always advise that parents are realistic when making their preferences			2
' the advice from the local authority is that parents include at least one preference for a nearby school where their child would have got in under the distance criterion in the past			0
for the vast majority of families the reason they do not get the first preference is because other children better met the school 's admission criteria than their child			0
' yesterday more than half a million pupils were notified of their places and a number of appeals are expected .			0
