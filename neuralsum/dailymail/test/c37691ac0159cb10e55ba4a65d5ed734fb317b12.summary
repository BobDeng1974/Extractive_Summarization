@entity1 ’s son has inadvertently waded into the row about the @entity4 ’s kitchen as he declared it ‘ the best ’ in his house			1
the unwitting admission from five - year - old @entity8 , to be broadcast tonight , came as mr @entity1 yet again wheeled out his children for the cameras			1
it is the fourth time they have appeared on screen during the campaign – once for a @entity16 profile , again for an interview on @entity19 ’s @entity18 , a third time for a campaign visit in @entity22 over @entity23 , and again this evening on @entity19			2
and it led to accusations that mr @entity1 lives an ‘ @entity47 ’ lifestyle last night as he was forced to admit that he needs two kitchens because the family nanny lives in the basement of his @entity53 ‘ mansion ’			1
however , mr @entity1 , who is filmed attempting to make scrambled eggs , claims controversy about his kitchen ‘ makes me laugh ’			2
he tells @entity19 ’s political editor @entity58 : ‘ this is the kitchen we use , i mean there ’s a kitchen downstairs			2
our nanny lives downstairs and it ’s sort of a basement area , a basement flat			0
she uses the kitchen downstairs and we use this kitchen			0
’ but the revelation that he keeps the help downstairs will do little to bolster mr @entity1 ’s claim that he is in touch with struggling families			2
@entity74 mp @entity73 : ‘ this exposes @entity1 for the hypocrite and champagne socialist that he is			2
he claims he is on the side of working people but the reality is his home life is like a scene from @entity47			0
’ @entity8 , @entity1 's eldest son , tells the camera the spartan kitchen – that last month sparked such controversy for mr @entity1 – is the ‘ best ’ in the £ 2.7million home in a personal interview with @entity19 ’s tonight programme , mr @entity1 also brushes aside controversy about embarrassing pictures last year of him struggling to eat a bacon sandwich			1
but mr @entity58 reveals he has been asked not to film mrs @entity90 eating the eggs her husband has cooked			0
the @entity4 leader indicates that spin chiefs have also told him not to be filmed eating , saying : ‘ apparently i ’m not allowed to eat them			0
’ mr @entity1 ’s kitchen hit the headlines last month when he was filmed in it by the @entity16			1
in the personal interview , mr @entity1 also brushes aside controversy about embarrassing pictures last year of him struggling to eat a bacon sandwich ( pictured ) critics questioned whether the small , utilitarian room could really be the main kitchen in a large @entity53 home that will qualify as a ‘ mansion ’ for the purposes of @entity4 ’s proposed @entity108			1
@entity110 columnist and @entity1 family friend @entity109 then intervened to say that the home ’s real kitchen is ‘ lovely ’			1
she said the room in which mr @entity1 was filmed was a ‘ functional kitchenette by the sitting room for tea and quick snacks ’			0
mr @entity1 ’s decision to again make prominent use of his sons @entity8 and @entity122 , four , to bolster his image is also likely to raise eyebrows			1
the boys are seen playing in a park and heard chatting with their parents			0
@entity128 and @entity129 have allowed much more limited media access to their children			0
a @entity4 source said : ‘ @entity37 and the children are the most important people in @entity1 ’s life and it is right that the public see he is a father and a family man			0

@entity1 came under fire last month for having two kitchens in £ 2.7m home
in an @entity19 interview , he admits that he has a second kitchen for his nanny
comment led to accusations @entity149 ' lifestyle
@entity8 , five , added to row by saying spartan kitchen was ' best ' in the house
