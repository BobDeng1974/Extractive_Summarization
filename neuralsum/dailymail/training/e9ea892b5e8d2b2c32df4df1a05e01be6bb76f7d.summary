by @entity0 published : 09:59 est , 9 august 2013 updated : 09:59 est , 9 august 2013 @entity1 has announced that it will be launching a mission in 2016 to lay the groundwork for asteroid mining - an activity that could add trillions of pounds to the world economy			1
the @entity9 spacecraft will arrive at the asteroid @entity10 in 2018 with the aim of collecting cosmic samples to return to @entity13			1
scientists hope the mission will accelerate technology that will soon enable humans to mine asteroids for precious metals			0
@entity1 scientists claim the high concentration of raw materials found in asteroids - such as ingredients for fuel and precious metals like iron and platinum - could supply @entity13 with vital stockpiles of natural resources			1
asteroids range in size from a few yards to hundreds of miles across			0
scientists believe that even a small , house - sized asteroid should contain metals possibly worth millions of pounds			0
@entity1 's @entity9 spacecraft will arrive at the asteroid @entity10 in 2018 with the aim of collecting cosmic samples to return to @entity13			1
scientists hope the mission will accelerate technology that will enable humans to mine asteroids for precious metals for instance , something called an ‘ s - type ’ asteroid could contain significant amounts of metal including iron , nickel and cobalt , as well as trace elements such as gold , platinum and rhodium			1
‘ a small , 10 - meter s - type asteroid contains about 1,433,000 pounds ( 650,000 kg ) of metal , with about 110 pounds ( 50 kg ) in the form of rare metals like platinum and gold , ’ said @entity68 of the @entity69 , @entity70 , principal investigator for @entity1 's @entity9 asteroid sample return mission			1
162385 ( 2000 @entity78 ) profit $ 3.44 trillion 4034 @entity79 profit $ 2.51 trillion 65679 ( 1989 @entity80 ) profit $ 1.77 trillion 7753 ( 1988 @entity81 ) profit $ 1.38 trillion @entity82 £ 870 billion the problem is it currently costs hundreds of millions and sometimes billions of pounds to build and launch a space mission			0
another obstacle is the lack of experience in mapping and analysing the resources in asteroids to extract material from them			2
the @entity9 ( origins , @entity94 , @entity95 ) mission aims to gain this experience			2
the spacecraft , scheduled for launch in september 2016 , will arrive at the asteroid @entity10 in october 2018 and study it in detail before returning with a sample of material from its surface			1
video : an artist 's concept of how @entity1 's @entity9 spacecraft will explore asteroid @entity10 , take a sample , and return it to @entity13 for analysis its primary purpose is scientific - since asteroids are relics from our solar system 's formation , analysis of the sample is expected to give insights into how the planets formed and life originated			1
the spacecraft will also measure how the push from sunlight alters the orbit of @entity10 , to help understand the risk of asteroids impacting @entity13			1
@entity1 has designed triple redundancy into the mission - if the first attempt fails , the team can try two more times to get at least 60 grams of sample , and up to 2,000 grams			0
‘ the mission will be a proof - of - concept – can you go to an asteroid , get material , and bring it back to @entity13 ? ’ said mr @entity68			1
‘ next , people will have to industrialise it so that the economy works out , so for the recoverable value in any given asteroid , you 're spending half that to bring it back			0
’ a computer generated image of swarms of low - cost robotic spacecraft that will enable extraction of resources from asteroids			2
in addition to mining for platinum and other precious metals , both @entity1 and other private ventures plans to tap asteroids ' water to supply orbiting fuel depots , which could be used for robotic and human space missions last year a team of scientists , with the backing of @entity165 and @entity166 film maker @entity163 , unveiled plans for a private space venture that would mine asteroids			2
the company , called @entity171 , is initially focusing on developing and selling extremely low - cost robotic spacecraft for surveying missions			0
within five to 10 years , however , it expects to progress from selling observation platforms in orbit around @entity13 to prospecting services			2
it plans to tap some of the thousands of asteroids that pass relatively close to @entity13 and extract their raw materials			1
not all missions would return precious metals and minerals to @entity13			0
in addition to mining for platinum and other precious metals , both @entity1 and other private ventures plans to tap asteroids ' water to supply orbiting fuel depots , which could be used for robotic and human space missions			0
one single asteroid in our solar system - @entity195 - has $ 95.8 ( £ 60 ) trillion of mineral wealth inside it - nearly the same as the annual gdp of the entire world			0
this is according to @entity201 , a website based on publicly available information that aims to catalogue the enormous wealth in the solar system , and also how little is currently known about what lies out there			0
the site has based most of its estimates - graphing profitability against accessibility - on information from @entity1 's @entity212 on what is actually inside asteroids is much thinner on the ground - hence @entity171 aims to spend much of its early budget on scanners to work out what 's out there.the site 's charts weigh up how easy it is to get to an asteroid versus how much wealth there is there - often minerals such as platinum , but in the case of @entity231 , hydrocarbons such as oil.the site was founded by student @entity232 , using publicly available data .			0

@entity9 will launch in 2016 and arrive at the asteroid @entity10 in 2018
it aim is to better understand the *behaviour* and *composition* of *asteriods*
asteroids could supply @entity13 with vital stockpiles of natural resources
