@entity0 , the man who was tricked into believing his wife 's two children were his for years appearing on this morning a man who discovered that the son and daughter he raised into their teenage years were not his was last week awarded £ 25,000 in damages after suing his ex-wife for deceit			1
today @entity0 appeared on this morning to talk about the landmark case and insisted he has ' no regrets ' about ordering the dna tests that ultimately destroyed his relationship with his children @entity15 and @entity16			1
mr @entity0 was a devoted father and family man until his marriage broke down			1
after the divorce he paid regular child maintenance for more than four years to his ex-wife @entity21 , from his salary as a factory manager			2
but in 2008 mr @entity0 ordered dna tests after hearing rumours about his daughter ’s paternity – and the results showed that each child was fathered by a different man			1
following the results , the children cut off all contact with him			1
he claims his ex-wife turned them against him			0
today on this morning mr @entity0 spoke of his devastation at discovering the children he has raised as his had in fact been fathered by two different men			1
he said : ' it was like a bereavement , words ca n't say how i felt			0
i would n't wish any bloke to go through what i 've been through			0
' i 've been robbed of having my own family ... i ca n't have children now			2
' last week mr @entity0 ’s solicitor , @entity47 , said : ‘ the court treated it as akin to bereavement , awarding a similar sum to the one you would receive if your child died in an accident , which is £ 11,800			1
‘ i think in this case , the county court judge went further than that because of the level of deceit and the fact that mr @entity0 ’s new wife is too old to give him children , so he has lost his chance of fatherhood			1
’ this morning host @entity67 asked mr @entity0 if he has since doubted his decision to pursue the dna tests			1
mr @entity0 replied : '' i think the children need to know who their real father is			1
' i have always said i will always be there for them as their step - dad and i wish that they will contact me in the future			2
' i wanted justice ... money does n't mean anything ... i just wanted justice ... to see the deceit laid bare			0
' i have no regrets			2
' mr @entity0 told hosts @entity67 and @entity86 that he has no regrets about ordering the paternity tests happy family : @entity15 and @entity16 are all smiles during a swimming session with loving ' father ' @entity0			1
both children were fathered by different men speaking last week mr @entity0 , 46 , from @entity94 , said : ‘ it ’s like a bereavement because i have lost the children i believed were mine			1
‘ i treated them both as if they were my own			0
i was there at their births , went to their nativity plays and helped them with school homework			0
‘ i ca n’t stop thinking about the children as they were my life			2
i always wanted children and grandchildren and now it ’s too late in life for me			2
‘ the children were the most important people in my life , and now they have gone			2
wedding day : @entity0 with @entity115 at @entity116 in june 1990			1
after the couple divorced in 2004 , @entity115 was granted custody of the children and mr @entity0 paid a total of £ 15,600 in maintenance ‘ but i had to do the dna tests			1
there was a whispering campaign going on that the children were n’t mine and i needed to know			2
i could n’t live with the uncertainty any longer			0
’ mr @entity0 started dating @entity115 , now 44 , in 1989 when they were both fruit - packers at a factory near @entity129 , @entity130			1
they moved into a caravan together and in 1990 married at @entity116			0
they had 60 guests at the reception at a village hall			0
' she has never even said sorry ' @entity16 was born in 1992 , with mr @entity0 present at the birth and signing the birth certificate			1
two years later @entity15 was born , with mr @entity0 still having no reason to suspect that @entity115 had been unfaithful			1
mr @entity0 said : ‘ my life seemed complete			1
we had moved into a house , i was happily married , had a good job and two healthy children – what more could i want ? ’ but by 2004 the marriage was struggling			1
mr @entity0 explained : ‘ @entity115 was disappearing for several days without telling me where she was going			1
i only found out from used train and coach tickets i discovered			0
‘ i would collect the children from school as usual and walk into the house and it would be empty with no note or anything			0
@entity115 would go to places such as @entity157 or @entity158 , and if i asked why she had gone there she would say , “ nothing to do with you			0
” ’ so sad : @entity0 and his second wife @entity162			2
his relationship with @entity16 and @entity15 has ' all gone ' when the couple divorced in 2004 , @entity115 was granted custody of the children and for the next four years mr @entity0 paid £ 300 a month maintenance for both children			1
his total bill was £ 15,600			0

‘ i confronted @entity115 on the phone but she insisted i was @entity16 ’s father			0
finally i said i wanted dna testing			0
’ the dna test was done by mouth swab and when the result came back mr @entity0 was stunned			1
he said : ‘ when i saw the letter stating that i was n’t @entity16 ’s father i just broke down			2
‘ when i phoned @entity115 we had an argument and she just said , “ what did you expect			0
” she did n’t even say sorry			0
’ mr @entity0 did n’t tell @entity16 but he described in court documents how her attitude changed towards him			2
he said : ‘ she did n’t come to see me and if i saw her in the street she would make obscene gestures with her fingers and on one occasion even kicked my car			0
’ @entity16 also posted a cruel message on @entity197 that read : ‘ i hate you so much , i reali [ sic ] loved you so when you called me your little angel i take it you was just saying it and you start all that after 16 years you have ruined mine and adams life i hope your happy for what you have put us through ! ! ’ mr @entity0 also decided to have a dna test done to check @entity15 ’s paternity			1
‘ i still have no idea who is @entity15 ’s father , ’ he said			0
‘ for nearly 17 years i cared for @entity16 as my daughter and for @entity15 for over 14 years and now it ’s all gone			0
