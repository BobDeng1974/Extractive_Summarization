a second military healthcare worker has been flown back to the @entity1 after suffering a suspected needle injury while treating @entity4 patients in @entity5			1
@entity6 today confirmed the worker has been admitted to the @entity8 in @entity9 for monitoring			1
a spokesman stressed that at this time ' they have not been diagnosed with @entity4 and do not have symptoms '			1
it comes after another healthcare worker arrived back in the @entity1 on saturday for @entity4 monitoring amid fears they were exposed to the virus when treating patients in @entity5			1
but officials were quick to stress the two incidents are not thought to be related			0
@entity20 said there is no risk to the general public			2
professor @entity32 , @entity20 's director for health protection and medical director , today said : '' we can confirm that all the appropriate support is being offered to this individual and that strict protocols have been followed to transfer them back to the @entity1			1
' we would like to emphasise that there is no risk to the general public 's health			0
' our thoughts are with both of the healthcare workers , and their families , affected at this time			2
' both healthcare workers will remain at the @entity8 in @entity48 for the remainder of their 21 - day incubation periods			1
the virus has an incubation period of between two days and three weeks			1
the @entity8 has the capacity to assess and monitor the latest returning healthcare worker alongside their colleague , admitted on saturday			1
being pricked by a needle is a cause for concern because the virus is spread through contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person			2
the individual is likely to have been exposed to the virus but has not been diagnosed with @entity4 and does not have symptoms			1
pictured is the @entity67 at @entity8 the medics are being treated at @entity9 's @entity8 ( @entity73 ) , where @entity1 nurses @entity69 ( left ) and @entity70 ( right ) were treated in a specialist isolation unit there are currently no specific drugs to cure @entity4 , nor any approved vaccines to prevent the disease			1
two experimental vaccines are currently being trialled on human volunteers in the @entity1 , @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 and @entity84			2
the medics transferred to the @entity8 in @entity9 are currently being monitored and health officials have stressed they have not been diagnosed with the disease			1
in the event they do begin to show symptoms they will receive supportive care			0
the @entity8 is the only @entity92 in the @entity1 to house two high - security containment beds			1
they are located inside isolation ' bubbles ' - specially - designed tents with controlled ventilation allowing medics to provide clinical care while containing the infection			2
three other hospitals - the royal @entity100 and @entity102 , @entity103 and @entity104 - are designated centres for escalation if more patients are diagnosed with @entity4			1
there are around 50 other designated @entity4 beds at these three centres			2
initially medics work to re-hydrate patients using oral and intravenous fluids			2
specific symptoms such as diarrohea and fever are treated directly , to try and improve her chances of surviving			0
@entity120 , the @entity1 nurse who survived @entity4 , was treated with the experimental drug @entity121			1
it is a blend of three laboratory - made antibodies designed to neutralise the virus			2
two @entity81 aid workers , dr @entity127 and @entity128 were also given the drug after they were infected with the virus while working in @entity82			0
they too , subsequently recovered			0
but experts do not know if those given the drug were saved by it , or whether luck played a part			0
around 45 per cent of those infected in the current outbreak have survived without treatment			0
meanwhile at least two other patients treated with @entity121 have died , possibly because help got to them too late			0
@entity121 , developed by @entity81 biotech company @entity142 , is manufactured in the leaves of genetically modified tobacco plants			0
in september , shortly after being discharged from the @entity8 , mr @entity70 , travelled to the @entity81 to undergo a blood transfusion to help an @entity81 colleague who was being treated for the virus			1
it is thought the blood of those who have survived the disease may contain antibodies , which can prove effective in fighting the disease			0
minister for the @entity156 @entity155 , said despite two similar incidents with a short space of time , ' both appear to be unrelated '			0
he said : ' our personnel receive the highest standard of training and briefing prior to deployment , including on the use of the specialised @entity167			0
' on a visit to the country before @entity171 i witnessed first - hand the bravery and commitment of the personnel who are doing such a fantastic job in @entity5			1
' their efforts are deserving of the highest praise and we wish all the best for their 2 colleagues who are now in the @entity1			2
' he stressed admitting the healthcare worker to the @entity8 is an ' entirely precautionary measure ' , adding the priority is the ' wellbeing of the individual involved '			1
their family has been informed and ' will receive all possible support from the government ' , mr @entity155 added			0
on saturday the first military healthcare worker , suspected of coming into contact with the virus via a needle injury , was admitted to the @entity8			1
the injury is thought to have been inflicted while the individual was treating a patient near @entity5 's capital @entity198			1
it is thought the medic was working at the @entity202 treatment centre , 40km from @entity198 and that the injury happened within 48 hours of their being flown home			2
that is the window of opportunity to fly someone who has had known exposure to @entity4 back to the @entity1 , as they are not yet contagious			1
the virus has an incubation period of between two and 21 days			1
@entity20 said the individual arrived back in the @entity1 on an @entity215 flight after being exposed to the virus in a ' frontline care setting '			1
it is believed the military transport , bringing the patient back as a precautionary measure , arrived at @entity222 in @entity223 in the early hours of saturday morning			1
the latest medic is likely to have been flown home in similar circumstances			0
the @entity202 complex includes an 80 - bed treatment centre managed by @entity229 and a 12 - bed centre staffed by @entity232 medics specifically for health care workers and international staff responding to the @entity4 crisis			1
the patients are being treated at @entity9 's @entity8 ( @entity73 ) , where @entity1 nurses @entity69 and @entity70 were treated in a specialist isolation unit			1
they were each diagnosed with the disease after helping treat patients in @entity241			2
the @entity8 , said in a statement : ' we can confirm that a second @entity1 military healthcare worker has been admitted to the @entity8 today following a needlestick injury while working in @entity5			1
' the individual has been admitted to the @entity8 for assessment			1
' the individual is likely to have been exposed to ebola virus but has not been diagnosed with @entity4 and does not have symptoms			1
' it is thought the first medic , who was flown home on saturday , was working at the @entity202 treatment centre ( pictured ) , 40km from @entity198 there is one known case of a @entity1 person becoming infected with @entity4 following a needle stick accident			1
@entity259 contracted the virus when he accidentally pricked his finger while taking a sample from an infected guinea pig at the @entity264 at @entity265 in @entity266			0

the @entity273 said the epidemic has entered a ' second phase ' with the focus shifting to ending the outbreak			0
the first symptoms of @entity4 include a fever , headaches , joint and muscle pain , a sore throat and intense muscle weakness			2
patients typically develop these symptoms after five to seven days , but can appear between two and 21 days of a person becoming infected			2
after these symptoms develop people experience diarrhoea , vomiting , a rash , and stomach pain before liver and kidney functions deteriorate			0
if untreated , @entity4 then causes internal bleeding and patients can bleed from their ears , eyes , nose or mouth			1
the first trial of an @entity4 vaccine to take place in the region worst hit by the epidemic is starting today in @entity82			2
in a densely - populated neighbourhood of the capital @entity321 yesterday musicians launched the clinical trial			0
guests clapped , danced along and nodded as they sang lyrics which explained the purpose and intent of the ebola vaccination trial			0
the singing was part of a campaign to overcome @entity82 ' reluctance to embrace the vaccines amid conspiracy theories			0
a health worker tests lab samples at @entity338 in @entity321 , formerly an ebola holding centre			0
the first vaccine trial to take place in the region worst affected during the epidemic has started in @entity82 the actual trial begins in the @entity82 capital today on the first group of volunteers			0
the vaccination trial is a product of a partnership set up by the governments of @entity82 and the @entity81			0
appearing at the launch event yesterday , @entity82 vice president @entity351 said the vaccines are ' very important for @entity82 and for the world '			0
the vaccines contain a trace of ebola virus that helps trigger an immune response against the virus , according to a document from @entity361 , the acronym for @entity363 in @entity82 , as the @entity81 - @entity82 collaboration is called			0
mr @entity351 urged @entity82 ' to take courage because it is going to work '			0
