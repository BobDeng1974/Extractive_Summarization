a schoolteacher from @entity1 has returned from her trip to @entity3 with a remarkable up - close photo of a great white shark that has been making waves on social media			1
@entity9 , 25 , an art teacher from @entity10 , traveled halfway across the world to volunteer as a scientific data collector for @entity13 - an organization dedicated to animal conservation and eco-tourism			1
@entity17 , a lifelong shark enthusiast and amateur photographer , was enjoying cage diving in @entity21 off @entity22 one day hoping to catch a glimpse of the much - maligned sea creatures - and she did n’t have to wait long			1
@entity25 ' muisc : @entity9 , 25 , an art teacher from @entity1 , took this incredible picture while cage diving in @entity21 , @entity3 shark selfie : @entity17 , pictured here with a much smaller shark , traveled to @entity3 to volunteer as a scientific data collector for @entity13 bait : the female shark was lured with two fish heads being pulled on a rope around the cage the daredevil teacher had her new @entity38 trained on the surface of the water when a hulking female shark appeared directly in front of her , its enormous maw bristling with razor - sharp teeth open wide			1
in @entity17 's photo , which has since become a viral sensation , the steel - grey beast emerges from emerald - colored waters , lured by a pair of fish heads tied to a rope as bait			2
‘ i was n't even a little bit frightened , ’ @entity17 boasted to @entity54 about the fateful moment			2
‘ when you 're there and you 're in their presence , it 's not scary			0
they 're beautiful and graceful , and you can see how intelligent they are			0
’ the art teacher said she took about 30 shots with the camera in burst mode , but none was as dramatic as that one toothy picturet			1
best in show : with her @entity38 camera in burst mode , @entity17 took 30 snapshots , but only one stood out behind bars : @entity17 photographed the graceful sea creature from the safety of a partially submerged cage @entity78 : the art teacher described herself as a life - long shark enthusiast matter of perception : @entity17 noted that the fish eye lens on her camera made the shark appear closer to the cage than it was in reality ' i knew immediately that that photo was going to do something , ' @entity17 told @entity93			1
upon her return home , @entity17 hung her now - famous picture of the shark with its mouth agape in her classroom at @entity101 in @entity102 to inspire her young students			2
the vivid snapshot has been shared thousands of times on social media sites and has been the subject of fawning news articles , blog posts and tv segments			0
but @entity17 also has been subjected to criticism from shark advocates over the use of bait in the taking of the photo			2
speaking to @entity118 , the @entity1 educator explained that the fish heads used to lure the shark were pulled around and out of the way of the cage to make sure the sea creature did n't lunge and the steel bars			0
courting controversy : some people have criticized @entity17 for using bait to lure the hulking fish , but the shark enthusiast pointed out that precautions have been taken to make sure the shark stays away from the cage ‘ that ’s one thing that we learned right off the bat , is that you never want the shark to make contact with the cage , ’ she noted			0
‘ and you also do n’t want the shark to eat the bait			0
you do n’t feed the sharks ; that ’s not what we want to do			0
’ @entity17 added that the fish - eye lens on her camera made the shark appear closer to her than it was in reality , which was about 3 feet from the cage			1
she said the shark came out of nowhere , and she was simply at the right place and at the right time with her trusty @entity38 at the ready			0
‘ i ’d been waiting for this kind of experience my whole life , ’ @entity17 told @entity153			0
the makers of @entity38 took notice of @entity17 's ringing endorsement of their camera and featured her photo on their @entity163 account , which helped the shark - tastic snapshot go viral .			1
