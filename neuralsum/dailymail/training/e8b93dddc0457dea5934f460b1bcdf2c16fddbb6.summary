@entity0 has made it his ambition to give @entity3 the perfect send - off — and birthday present — by leading @entity6 to @entity8 glory			1
@entity6 ’s captain will move to @entity10 , to either @entity11 or @entity12 , once his contract expires at the end of this season and , as it stands , his last game is scheduled to be against @entity17 in the @entity18 at the @entity19 on may 24			2
the @entity8 final , however , is staged on may 30 this year — the day @entity3 turns 35 — and @entity0 believes there could be no better way for his captain to end his lifelong association with @entity6 than by walking around @entity25 clutching one of the game ’s biggest prizes			1
he has twice won the @entity8 before in 2001 and 2006 and lost another final in 2012			1
@entity3 is expected to start monday 's third - round clash against @entity46 side @entity34 , with @entity0 showing how seriously he is taking the competition by naming a strong side			1
he certainly does not want this to be the last time @entity3 plays in the @entity8			1
‘ our aim was always to win a trophy this year and even more so now with that added incentive , ’ said @entity0			0
‘ to have a captain who has been a monumental figure for this club leaving there ’d be no greater tribute than to reach a final , particularly an @entity8 final			1
‘ to see him lift a trophy , that is what dreams are all about			0
it would be a great way for him to end his career and certainly we do n’t want @entity17 to be our last game of the season			0
’ it has been an emotional time for @entity3 and the strain he has been under was illustrated during a 13 - minute interview with @entity6 ’s television station that was aired on saturday evening ; there were a couple of occasions when he had to pause to compose himself			2
@entity3 spoke to @entity6 's in - house tv channel in an exclusive interview released on saturday evening @entity3 revealed he had a chat with @entity0 about his future at the club before deciding to leave @entity3 took the decision to leave after @entity0 explained to him his amount of playing time would be ‘ managed ’ next season , the midfielder admitting he would find it hard to accept being a squad player , given he has been a fixture in the team throughout his career			2
‘ i ’m bright enough to realise that it is the right thing for everyone , ’ said @entity3			0
@entity0 is now looking at others to step into the leadership role at the club			0
@entity33 will almost certainly become club captain when @entity3 hands over the armband — ‘ it was one of the reasons i made him vice-captain , ’ according to @entity0 — and there are others , such as @entity99 , in whom the manager sees potential			0
@entity99 is edging closer to signing a new long - term contract , and @entity0 added : ‘ hopefully they can become that type of leader and character that makes up successful teams			0

@entity6 face @entity34 in the @entity8 third round on monday night
@entity3 has won two @entity115 with @entity6 in 2001 and 2006
