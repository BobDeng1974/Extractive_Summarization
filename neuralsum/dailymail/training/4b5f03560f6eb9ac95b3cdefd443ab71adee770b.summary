@entity0 has revealed that @entity1 had to be driven down in a limo to @entity3 for @entity6 's @entity5 fourth round clash on sunday			1
the 25 - year - old came off the bench to net the winner for the @entity6 against the @entity11 high - flyers to send them through to the next round			1
however , @entity1 's inclusion was a surprising one considering he withdrew from the @entity15 squad to take part in this month 's @entity17 , after aggravating a back injury he picked up on international duty in november - which consequently ruled him out for three @entity24 games			1
the 60 - year - old has now been forced to defend the east @entity38 side 's handling of the injury , insisting he done ' nothing wrong ' by playing him in the cup tie against @entity43 's men			2
when questioned after the game @entity0 told @entity45 : ' he 's still unable to fly			0
the 25 - year - old has been in excellent form since joining the @entity6 - scoring 10 goals in 16 appearances @entity43 's side gave a good account of themselves in the narrow defeat to the @entity24 side ' we had to drive him ( @entity1 ) down in a limo on saturday afternoon , but other than that he said he can get out on the pitch and just see how he goes			2
' today ( sunday ) was about putting him on the bench with the hope we did n't have to use him , but in the end bringing him on was the most important tactical decision for us			0
' i spoke with the chairman and said he looks alright			0
we do n't think we 're doing anything wrong with what we 've done and how we 've approached it			0

@entity6 got the better of @entity11 high - flyers @entity3 on sunday as they *progressed* to the @entity5 fifth round
@entity1 came off the bench to score the winner for the @entity6
the 25 - year - old withdrew from the @entity15 squad to *compete* in the @entity17 after aggravating a back injury for @entity6 on *january* 1
the *initial* injury was picked up on international duty in november , incensing @entity6 boss @entity0
but the 60 - year - old has defended his decision to include @entity1 against @entity3 despite his *recent* injury *struggles*
