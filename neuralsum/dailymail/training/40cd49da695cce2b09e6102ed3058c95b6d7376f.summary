click here for our brilliant @entity2 service including @entity5 's heat map ... maybe @entity6 is the genius he often purports himself to be after all			2
here at a rapturous @entity9 , @entity8 made one of the biggest calls of this @entity12 and saw it take his team in to a semi-final with @entity16 on wednesday			1
having seen his team pour all over @entity17 for 120 minutes but fail to score , @entity8 sent on @entity19 goalkeeper @entity18 to face the penalties			1
@entity18 had barely had time warm up and the man he replaced , @entity22 , had made a save in the 118th minute to keep his country in the competition			1
but @entity8 is a coach who always seems to know what he is doing and @entity18 saved the second @entity17 penalty from @entity29 ’s @entity28 , and then the fourth from @entity30 , to take @entity31 through			1
it was all that the @entity33 deserved , too			2
not only did they produce a nerveless shootout performance to score through @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity5 and @entity39 , they were relentless all night in the face of some remarkable misfortune			1

attendance : 51,179 * @entity129 ratings by @entity131 * @entity5 was the star of the 120 minutes			0
four of the @entity17 back five were booked for fouling him			1
not once did he dive			0
@entity38 , meanwhile , hit the frame of the goal twice - once in the 119th minute - while @entity17 goalkeeper @entity134 made a string of great saves			1
this @entity12 has another great story to add to the list and another great game			1
this one had the right ending , though			0
this tournament has a semi-final to savour			0
@entity8 ’s team were superior in the first half , too			0
they dominated possession and , with @entity38 perhaps playing his best football of the @entity12 to date , they created enough promising positions to have taken a firm grip on the game			1
what was missing was good decision - making and timing			2
all too often the @entity33 managed to break on the @entity17 backline only to let themselves down when it mattered			1
it was unlike them as , on the whole , they have shown a clinical edge in front of goal			0
@entity165 was guilty early on			0
having started the tournament so brightly with his explosive performance against @entity170 , the @entity167 striker looked frustrated after failing to take an opportunity fashioned beautifully by the industry of @entity39 and the vision of @entity174			0
@entity174 ’s pass found @entity165 with only the keeper to beat but he could not manage it			0
the impressive @entity134 blocked to keep @entity17 level			1
@entity134 also saved @entity38 ’s follow up from the edge of the area and , later , was equal to a free - kick from the same player			2
flying high : @entity37 is forced to jump over @entity134 as the goalkeeper claims the ball aerial duel : @entity31 defender @entity186 feels the full force of the ball as he beats @entity111 in the air fall to the floor : @entity28 takes a tumble under @entity174 as @entity192 watches on bend it like @entity38 : the @entity31 frontman unleashes a curling effort at goal which evades @entity64 battle : @entity90 challenges @entity17 's @entity198 frontman @entity112 on the edge of the area @entity109 scores 0 - 1 @entity202 persie scores 1 - 1 @entity28 misses - @entity18 saves 1 - 1 @entity5 scores 2 - 1 @entity108 scores 2 - 2 @entity38 scores 3 - 2 @entity111 scores 3 - 3 @entity39 scores 4 - 3 @entity30 misses @entity204 saves that apart , @entity134 did not have to excel but @entity31 really should have worked him more			1
an early run by @entity5 looked dangerous but was ended by a tackle from @entity108			0
@entity5 did not go to ground			0
the @entity210 player remained dangerous and whenever @entity31 advanced it was @entity5 who was at the heart of things			1
more than once he seemed about to make a decisive intervention only for things to break down or an offside flag to go up			0
@entity134 did make one more save of note in the first half , blocking from @entity91			0
@entity17 seemed happy to wait for chances			1
they looked dangerous at set - pieces and came close after the half - hour when @entity109 headed down a free - kick and an overhead kick from @entity107 forced @entity165 to hack clear			2
eyes on the prize : @entity28 brings the ball down on his chest under the challenge of @entity90 under pressure : @entity231 makes a pass as @entity31 frontman @entity38 chases the ball down one for the cameras : @entity17 goalkeeper @entity134 stretches through the air to make a save @entity237 confidence was growing and who could blame them ? since the interval , @entity31 had threatened only sporadically			1
@entity165 and @entity5 combined midway through the half but the centre - forward ’s return into @entity5 ’s path was underhit and @entity17 cleared			1
@entity165 was having a poor night			0
@entity8 then brought on @entity245			2
he was offside when bringing a save from @entity105 before @entity38 smacked a post with a free - kick			2
@entity165 then brought a low save from @entity134			2
on both occasions , @entity17 were fortunate to see the ball rebound to safety			1
even @entity165 could not be blamed deep in added time , when his far - post shot from a @entity90 cross rolled up @entity64 ’s shin and on to the bar			2
it was an astonishing end to a 90 - minute period that belonged to the @entity33			1
into extra time and @entity86 saw a header saved then @entity107 had to hack clear from his own line			0
nothing they could do , it seemed , could save them from the ordeal of a penalty shootout			1
and even then @entity17 almost won it at the death , @entity271 weaving through to shoot against @entity22 , before @entity38 struck the bar with two minutes left			1
second best : @entity5 loses out as @entity17 's @entity109 gets a strong foot on the ball stretching : @entity17 's @entity70 does his best to rob the ball from @entity37 hot pursuit : @entity39 turns with the ball in an attempt to avoid @entity111 ' challenge in control : @entity112 takes the ball in the air as @entity31 's @entity283 centre back @entity86 watches on			1

@entity31 are through to the @entity12 semi-finals after a penalty shootout victory against @entity17
@entity18 was brought on in the last minute of *extra-time* just for the penalty shootout
@entity19 goalkeeper saves two of five spot - kicks to send @entity31 through
