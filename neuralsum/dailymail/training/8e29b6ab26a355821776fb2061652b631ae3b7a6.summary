@entity7 , 26 , has designed a weight - activated seat sensor which notifies a parent 's mobile phone when their child is still in their baby seat			1

it will cost £ 36 ( $ 60 ) what 's more , if they have n't noticed the notification on their phone , the device - called @entity25 - will then tell their emergency contacts within five minutes			2
the small sensor - just 1.5 inches ( 3.8cm ) round and as thick as a few coins , will cost £ 36 ( $ 60 ) when its @entity37 crowd funding campaign ends in september			2
mr @entity7 , founder of @entity38 who made the device , became a father to @entity40 for the first time just over four months ago			0
he said : ' on average , one child dies in a hot car every nine days in the @entity45			1
with @entity25 , we aim to make that number zero			0
