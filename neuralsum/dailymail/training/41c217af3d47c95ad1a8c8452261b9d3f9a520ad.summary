by @entity0 they have only just met , but this monkey and gorilla are already the best of friends at their home in @entity8 zoo			1
soon after they were introduced , keepers noticed the newly arrived red - capped @entity11 mangabey whisper something into three - year - old gorilla @entity15 's ear			1
there 's no telling what the little mangabey was telling the gorilla , but who knows , he could have been revealing the secret location to a stash of bananas			1
guess what : a red - capped mangabey , left , appears to hug and whisper into three - year - old gorilla @entity15 's ear can you believe it : soon after they were introduced , the newly arrived red - capped @entity11 mangabey had an in - depth conversation with @entity15 how many bananas : there 's no telling what the little mangabey was telling the gorilla , but he could have revealed all about a stash of bananas @entity41 , team leader at the @entity42 said : ' it has been very exciting to watch the red - capped mangabeys and the gorillas getting used to each other over the past few weeks			1
' when the time came for them to meet face to face things could not have gone better			0
the younger gorillas in particular are very curious about the mangabeys and keen to get to know and play with them			0
' ' to introduce and keep these two species in the same space and ensure that they live harmoniously together is a challenge but so far it has been very successful , ' the zoo says			2
the mangabeys will be sharing the @entity59 with the @entity61 ’s gorilla family			0
the distribution of western lowland gorillas and red - capped mangabeys in @entity11 overlaps			1
they are a bachelor group which was formed to assist the @entity67 breeding programme for this species			0
lovely to see you : the two primates hit it off immediately according to zoo staff and have remained close see you later : the little red - capped mangabey takes a stroll in his new surroundings after his chit chat with his gorilla mate wearing a crown of red on top of their heads , the red - capped mangabey is a small primate with a distinctive face , white eyes and white fur framing the face			1
they are mostly found in coastal , swamp , mangrove , and valley forests , from western @entity94 , east and south @entity95 , and throughout @entity96 , @entity97 , and the @entity97 - @entity99 border by the @entity101 shore			0
the petite monkey , also known as the ' collared mangabey ' ( @entity103 ) is tall and slender and typically lives in large groups of 10 to 35 individuals including several males			2
mangabeys appear equally at home 30 metres up in the trees and on the ground and have a unique calling pattern in the form of cackles and barks which are used to keep the group in contact and signal their position to other groups			0
a throat sac gives resonance to their wide range of calls and is well developed in the males , but females also have small sacs – giving rise to loud cackles , whoops ( da - ooo ) , ‘ baddas ’ and @entity128 diet consists of fruits and seeds , but they also eat leaves , foliage , flowers , invertebrates , mushrooms , dung , and @entity140 monkey has no defined breeding season but reaches sexual maturity at five to seven years			2
due to loss of habitat and being hunting for bushmeat they are listed as vulnerable on the @entity148 's @entity147 .			0

a monkey and gorilla walk into @entity8 zoo - and become the best of mates
the red - capped @entity11 mangabey only recently arrived at the zoo
but before long , the pair appeared to be hugging and having a chit chat
