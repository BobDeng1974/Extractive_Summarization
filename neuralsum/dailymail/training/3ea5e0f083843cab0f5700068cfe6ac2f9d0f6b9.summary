by @entity0 published : 19:32 est , 14 may 2013 updated : 01:38 est , 15 may 2013 rule change : migrant workers from @entity3 and @entity4 will soon be eligible to work elsewhere in the economy the cost of @entity9 - grown fruit and vegetables could soar by 15 per cent because of a shortage of migrant farm workers , government advisers warned yesterday			1
a third of the country ’s 67,000 seasonal farm jobs are filled by @entity3 and @entity4 , who are not allowed to work elsewhere in the economy			1
but that restriction will be lifted in january , so citizens of the two countries will be free to take up jobs in hotels , restaurants , coffee shops and care homes			0
the @entity25 said ministers faced a choice between allowing a new wave of migrants from outside the @entity30 to replace them , or seeing prices rise			1
the cost of celery , strawberries and salad leaves could leap by 10 or 15 per cent , advisers said			1
the committee said it did not believe @entity9 workers would be prepared to take the farm jobs			1
chairman @entity40 said the way the benefits system works meant a person working long hours in a field could receive as little as £ 100 extra per month			0
they would also face the problem of having to return to benefits , as most work lasts for only six months each year			2
temporary curbs were imposed on @entity3 and @entity4 in 2005 to protect the @entity9 labour market , but they expire in december and , under @entity30 laws , can not be extended			1
the present @entity52 allows 21,750 @entity3 and @entity4 to come into @entity9 for half the year			1
when this ends , professor @entity53 said farmers expect many of them to move to other roles because of the ‘ intensity ’ of harvesting			0
the jobs can be physically demanding , with workers bending down 4,000 times during a typical eight - hour celery - picking shift			0
the academic added : ‘ the @entity65 have graduated to jobs in hospitality , and into the care sector and construction			0
one could see the @entity3 and @entity4 doing something similar			1
’ the present @entity30 labour rules allows 21,750 @entity4 and @entity3 to come into @entity9 for half the year professor @entity53 said it was up to ministers to decide what to do next			1
one option , which the @entity76 is urging the government to pursue , is to introduce a new seasonal agricultural workers scheme for migrants from countries such as the @entity81 or @entity82			2
this would help to keep down the cost of @entity9 food , but would create a significant political headache for a government committed to reducing migration			2
the workers would mostly be coming into the @entity91 - dominated shires			0
the impact of the new rules is not expected to be felt immediately , but the report said prices were likely to rise within one or two years			2
it gave the example of one firm , which charged an average of 75p for an iceberg lettuce between 2007 and 2012			0
in 2008 , when there was a shortage of staff , this leapt to 86p			0
professor @entity53 said that if the labour supply ‘ dwindled ’ when @entity3 and @entity4 get full @entity30 rights in january , operators may have to ‘ drive wages up ’ to secure staff			1
he said : ‘ in those circumstances , therefore , it ’s possible that supermarkets would charge higher prices			0
’ a @entity116 spokesman said : ‘ we are grateful for the @entity25 ’s report and note its conclusion that there is little evidence the supply of seasonal labour will decline in the next one or two years			2
‘ we shall consider the @entity25 ’s advice very carefully			0
but in general we want to encourage employers to recruit from the resident labour market where possible			0

@entity3 and @entity4 make up third of @entity9 *'s* seasonal farm workers
will be allowed to work elsewhere when @entity30 labour rules change in 2014
government advisers believe prices could rise by up to 15 per cent
