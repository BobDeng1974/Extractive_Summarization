cloudy skies prevented the gathering of pagans , druids and partygoers , from basking in the sun as they marked the summer solstice			2
by sunset last night , 2,000 people had arrived at the stone circle to begin an overnight vigil			1
their numbers swelled before the sun reappeared just before 5am			2

' approximately 70 cannabis street warnings were issued			2
as with previous years , the passive drugs dogs proved very effective			0
' the success of the event depends largely on the good nature of those attending and we are pleased that people could enjoy solstice in the spirit of the event			2
' the summer and winter solstices are one of the few chances to walk among the stones and dance within the stone circle , which is usually cordoned off to visitors to protect the site from further erosion			1
those gathered performed chants and music during the celebrations , with some also taking part in handfasting ceremonies where they promise to love each other for a year and a day , or for how long love will last			2
the solstice , which means the sun is standing still , was also marked by about 500 people at @entity91 , @entity21 , and a small crowd armed with golf umbrellas at @entity94 in the @entity95 , who kept watch for the sunrise at stone circles there			1

part of the road running alongside will be permanently closed as part of a long - awaited refurbishment of the @entity135			0
the closure and grassing over of the @entity137 will make @entity1 fully part of the landscape again , allowing visitors to relieve the walk between the stone circle and the prehistoric avenue that used to be the approach to the monument			1
it is part of work which includes the creation of a new visitor centre around 1.5 miles away from the monument , with a cafe , shop and museum showing artefacts and exploring theories about @entity1 , as well as three replica neolithic houses			0
@entity157 , also known as the @entity158 , from the @entity159 , wore a helmet of fake cameras and a makeshift robe for the night as the sun rose behind the clouds just before 5am today , druids conducted a ceremony at @entity1 the grey cloudy morning did not affect the mood at @entity1 , where visitors played music and performed rituals a woman plays the flute inside the megalithic stone circle during the early hours of this morning in @entity21 crowds were still celebrating the solstice at dawn despite keeping vigil overnight at @entity1 @entity179 , @entity1 director at @entity180 , said the closure of the road was ' a real milestone in terms of the history of the site '			1
she said that the current setting of the stones meant visitors could not fully enjoy and appreciate the site			0
@entity180 had wanted to close the road since it was nominated as a world heritage site and inscribed in 1986 , she said			0
' it really is a historic moment , ' she added			0
druid leader @entity193 led celebrations and called for peace in the north , south , east and west people meditated shortly after the 4.52am sunrise at @entity1 , where thousands gathered to mark the solstice pagans and druids were joined by partygoers wanting to experience the atmosphere of the solstice celebrations dancing and drumming was among the overnight activities as people stayed awake to greet the morning a couple of partygoers danced together in a rare chance to be among the @entity1 stones druids and pagans celebrated sunset last night before further celebrations this morning despite cloudy skies , thousands of people gathered at the 5,000 year old stone circle in @entity21 to see the dawn in the first stage , work will begin to remove tarmac on the road and grass it over			1
once a new visitor centre opens in december , a longer section of the @entity137 between @entity1 and the new facilities will be shut to traffic and become the route for visitors walking or travelling by shuttle to the stones			0
the cramped existing car parking and visitor facilities , first built in 1968 , will be removed and the area returned to grass			0
ms @entity179 said : ' when you are in @entity1 in the future , when grass is established , you will be able to make the link between the monument and the rest of the heritage landscape to the north , accessing the avenue , the route by which the monument was approached when it was used as a place of great ceremony			0
' a woman sat cross-legged to enjoy the last of the sunlight at @entity254 last night @entity255 performs with a hoop at the sunset celebrations at the @entity254 last night about 500 people attended a gathering at @entity91 , 22 miles away from @entity1 sunset celebrations began a night of partying and rituals to mark the solstice at the @entity254 visitors took part in the sunset celebrations at the @entity254 , heralding the longest day of the year closing the road was ' absolutely fundamental to all the improvements we 're making to the setting of the monument and all the improvements we are making to the visitor experience ' , she said			1
more than a million people visit @entity1 every year			2
@entity277 and @entity278 , from @entity279 , @entity280 , visiting on a coach tour just before the solstice , agreed that closing the road to link up the landscape was a good thing			2
ms @entity285 said of the monument : ' it 's amazing			0
i ca n't decide which theory i believe and i think it 's amazing how they ( the stones ) got here from @entity294			0
' in the @entity95 , this group of early risers braved wet weather to gather at the @entity94 stone circle near @entity299 the ancient stone circle at @entity94 is 5,000 years old			1
the need for umbrellas did not deter people from marking the solstice at the @entity306 site over in @entity308 , dance company @entity307 performed with visitors to welcome the sun but concerns have been raised that the changes to the site will have a bad effect on coach tours , which stop at @entity1 as one of a series of destinations			2
there are fears that some tour operators may bypass the site because of the extra time involved in transferring groups from a more distant visitor centre by shuttle to the monument			0
the busy @entity326 , which runs on the other side of @entity1 , will remain as plans to put the road into a tunnel proved too expensive			0
the refurbishment was due to be finished in time for the @entity332 , but was delayed as a result of @entity335 cuts which left @entity180 seeking to fill a £ 10million funding gap			0
it was met by an increased grant from the @entity339 and other sources			0
dance company @entity307 performed for visitors at @entity342 in the remote @entity343 in @entity308 @entity307 held their hands up to the sky , although this year heavy cloud cover meant that today the sunrise was not visible the forest was an atmospheric setting for the dance troupe 's celebration of nature the ancient ceremony of celebrating the solstice was set against the backdrop of the @entity342 , which specialises in astronomy - a perfect place to watch the sky festival goers set up camp at the observatory , where they could view the sunrise using solar viewing glasses and powerful telescopes cloud cover meant the exact moment of the sunrise itself could not been seen at the @entity342 drummers helped to create the exciting atmosphere in the forest , with projections of woodland scenes behind them @entity376 skiers set off from @entity377 on the @entity378 as thick fog covered the hills brave skiiers zoomed through the snow and fog on the @entity378 mountain range some even more kilts despite the chilly conditions on @entity377			1
