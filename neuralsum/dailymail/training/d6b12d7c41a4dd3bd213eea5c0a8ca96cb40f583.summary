@entity0 is set to launch an app for her style blog loves giving advice to girls with pale skin @entity6 and @entity8 's style by @entity9 published : 12:49 est , 2 december 2012 updated : 02:59 est , 3 december 2012 she is the fair skinned fashion blogger whose time on reality tv show made in @entity12 has made her synonymous with on - screen drama and friendship faux pas			1
but now @entity16 is ready to be taken seriously and is using the positive ( and the negative ) comments to make her mark on the fashion world			2
with her highly successful fashion blog at @entity21 about to be launched as a smartphone app and a place on the panel of styling website @entity25 , @entity0 has the fashion world at her feet			1
made in @entity12 star and blogger @entity16 is focusing on her true passion for fashion ' i always watch @entity33 and 90210 and you can never find out what outfits the stars are wearing so i set up my blog so viewers can access the outfits i wear on the show			1
' i get lots of comments and questions about what i wear and also what make - up i use for my pale skin so i wanted to create something accessible for viewers			1
it 's all so exciting and happening so fast , ' she told @entity50			2
the star firmly established herself on the e4 show but after putting herself in the public eye and showcasing her drama filled life for millions of viewers every week , the 22 - year - old has finally learnt to deal with the public negativity			0
she said : ' @entity58 has calmed down a lot			0
there are often offensive comments but we 've all learnt to be strong and tolerant and now we deal with it			0
no stranger to the spotlight , @entity0 is now on the panel of styling site @entity25 and has plans to turn her blog into an app ' we have realised that the people who write that stuff are just looking for a reaction			1
' but one thing @entity0 is constantly complimented on , by both viewers and her co-stars , is her immaculate sense of style			1
' my style is n't very girly			2
i love tailoring , structuring and lines			0
you 'll never catch me in puffy dresses , they do n't suit me			0
' but i 've learnt what does look good one me , i know tailored trousers suit me and blazers			0
i love sexy pointed heels and you do n't need to get your legs out to look sexy , it 's all about how you feel in an outfit , ' she said			2
she particularly rates frenemy @entity16 's style			1
' i think @entity6 dresses the best in the show			1
i think she and i have a similar style , we are both obsessed with hats			2
' she really reates co-star @entity16 's style and says they both love hats and as for the boys , she loves @entity107 ' style but think @entity16 is the one who can pull any look off with ease			1
but one co-star whose fashion footsteps she wo n't be following in is @entity112 - who recently unveiled a clothing line with @entity114			0
' i do n't think i 'd do what @entity112 did			0
i am very specific about who i 'd work with			0
if i did a collaboration i 'd want full input and because i love fashion so much i 'd never just take any opportunity that comes my way			0
' instead , @entity0 is focusing on developing her app and relishing in an ( almost ) drama - free season of made in @entity12			1
a love of fashion clearly runs in the family and her twin sister launched an underwear line called @entity129 ' this season is really fun			0
it 's nice to be removed from the drama , i was only involved before because i was supporting @entity112			2
' the dynamics have changed and my friendship with @entity6 has been a natural progression , we hang out outside of filming and have lots of mutual friends , ' she said			1
one girl she wo n't be forging a firm friendship with is newcomer @entity16 who recently caused a stir by refusing to attend @entity0 's dinner party with @entity16 and later showing up with his friend @entity143			1
' i do n't have an issue with @entity16 , we just are n't friends			0
i did n't know her before and i 'd say were not at all similar , ' said @entity0			1
@entity0 recently stepped out with a male friend but says she is a private person and would n't bring a boyfriend onto the show while her co-stars are busily immersed in on - screen love triangles and drama , @entity0 believes that love should be something saved for when the cameras stop rolling			2
' i am quite a private person and believe that you need to maintain something that is yours and yours only , someone to go home to			0
' as for romance , well ... we will have to wait and see			0
' for pale skin use @entity165 stick to add colour use a pale bronzer in winter only bright lipsticks are great for pale skin a killer pair of ankle boots are essential invest in a huge clutch bag for a day to night look @entity175 's are hot right now and keep you warm			1
