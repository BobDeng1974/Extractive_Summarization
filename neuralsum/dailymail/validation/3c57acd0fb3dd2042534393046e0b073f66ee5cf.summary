the @entity0 is back and so is the question that used to annoy him but now just brings a smile			1
age , for the striker who scored more @entity6 goals than @entity7 and @entity8 , has always been more than a number			1
that is possibly because @entity12 once joked @entity13 was a ‘ @entity14 25 ’			1
and because @entity16 claimed the striker told him he was 25 when he signed for @entity17 10 years ago			1
@entity18 striker @entity13 insists he has never been concerned with the questions marks over his age so , how old is he ? the profiles say 32 ; the sceptics are ruder			1
the big man among @entity18 ’s big dreamers says he ’s heard it all before			1
‘ it was always like this , ’ he says			1
‘ but it does not bother me			1
@entity29 has had it as well			2
' i just laugh about it — people joke and that is it			2
if i was lying i do n’t think i would be playing now			2
’ thankfully for @entity18 and the @entity37 , the jibes have not got the better of him			1
@entity13 scored the goal that saw off @entity40 in the fifth round to set up the tie against @entity43 , guaranteeing at least one side from outside the @entity6 will be at @entity45 in the semi-finals			1
for the neutrals , the hope is that @entity43 can trip up another bigger club			1
for @entity13 , there is the hope that he can make it to @entity45 for the first time after a mangled achilles tendon kept him out of @entity55 ’s 2009 final defeat against @entity56			1
the @entity14 striker scores @entity18 's second goal during the @entity37 fifth round defeat against @entity40 saturday ( kick - off 12.45pm )			1
tv : @entity62 1 ( from 12pm )			2
if he does , it will complete a quite surreal journey that spans almost three years since he left @entity67 — ending 10 seasons in @entity69 — following relegation to the @entity71			2
his absence has seen him scream at confused @entity74 footballers and gain a sweaty taste of football in @entity77			2
‘ no regrets , ’ as @entity13 says			1
and yet there were times in @entity74 , at @entity81 in the days before @entity82 rocked up , where he quite literally had no idea what was going on			2
‘ when i was there ( after leaving @entity67 ) , we had a @entity88 coach ( @entity87 ) and he spoke in @entity89 , ’ @entity13 says			1
‘ a guy that speaks @entity69 , he had to translate into @entity69 and then another guy had to translate from @entity89 to @entity74			2
the manager is supposed to speak for like five minutes but we are there for nine minutes			2
@entity13 , seen here celebrating a goal against @entity96 in 2004 , scored 43 goals for @entity98 @entity13 made sure @entity18 reached the @entity37 quarter - finals with this goal against the @entity101 @entity13 felt he was away from @entity69 football for too long and jumped at the chance to return ‘ it ’s so difficult to speak with your team - mates			1
you do n’t know how to tell him to pass			2
you just scream at him and when you scream , he knows that he has to give you the ball			2
‘ when you want to go shopping or to a restaurant , you have to have it written in your phone in @entity74 and you have to show it			2
everywhere you go , you have to take your phone and show it to the taxi driver			0
‘ but when @entity82 came in , it was great to work with him again			0
i worked with him at @entity116			0
he is always really calm			0
he just wants you to enjoy the game			0
@entity13 has scored more @entity6 goals than @entity7 ( above ) and @entity8 the frontman also scored 35 goals in 103 games for @entity17 between 2005 and 2007 ‘ sometimes when i played two or three games and did n’t score , he never said to me , “ you did n’t score ”			1
he ’d just walk towards me and say , smiling : “ it ’s been a while since you scored ”			1
’ after 18 months in @entity74 , @entity13 wound up at @entity127 in @entity77 last year			1
he is confident that despite having to train in the middle of the night , they can host a good @entity130			0
‘ i had a good offer in @entity77 , ’ he says			0
‘ it was another experience so no regrets			0
believe me , they can get a good @entity130 there			0
but when it is hot , it is hot			0
we had to train at 9.30pm in summer			0
you finish training at about 12 and then go home at 12.30am and then bed at about 4am			0
you have to stay home all day because it is really , really hot			1
you ca n’t train when it ’s 50 degrees , it is too much			0
’ the 32 - year - old had offers from @entity148 , @entity74 and @entity77 ahead of his move to @entity18 he adds : ‘ in winter it is good , we can train at 4pm			1
we played matches at 7.30pm or 8pm and they have to stop for water breaks once or twice			0
’ on deadline day last month he came back to the country where he first arrived in 2003 , when @entity156 took a punt on a striker playing in @entity159			1
‘ even when you play the big teams , @entity156 makes you believe , ’ he says			0
‘ he ’ll say , “ the defence is not good			0
come on , just kill him ”			0
if you ’re scared , like you ’re going to play against @entity164 , he ’d say , “ @entity164 ? he ’s s * * *			0
’ the memories of his first @entity69 stint make him happy			0
now his hope is to finally reach @entity45 on his second chapter			0
‘ every player wants that , ’ he says			0
you ’re never too old to dream			0
the veteran striker believes former boss @entity156 ( left ) ' makes you believe '			0

@entity13 has faced doubts about his age for the *majority* of his career
32 - year - old sealed deadline day move to @entity18 in *september*
he scored winner against @entity40 to help @entity18 into @entity37 quarter - finals
@entity14 is hoping to help @entity18 to *victory* against @entity43
