@entity0 announced a record annual profit of around £ 18.4million on thursday — paving the way for @entity3 to further strengthen his squad in january			1
the current @entity6 leaders also reported a record turnover of £ 319.8m for the year up to june 30 , and will comfortably pass @entity9 ’s @entity8 ( @entity8 ) test thanks to the funds brought in by the sale of @entity13 and @entity14 , plus their share of the new £ 1bn television deal			1
this is the second time in three years that @entity0 have posted a profit and is further proof of the club 's emergence as @entity24 football ’s leading club on and off the pitch , confounding the belief that years of wild spending under @entity28 would backfire			1
@entity0 are set to announce a report profit of £ 20m for the year ending on june 30 2004 - loss £ 74.7m 2005 - loss £ 131.6m 2006 - loss £ 77.1m 2007 - loss £ 65.6m 2008 - loss £ 69.2m 2009 - loss £ 45.8m 2010 - loss £ 69.2m 2011 - loss £ 70.7m 2012 - profit £ 1.4m 2013 - loss £ 49.4m 2014 - profit 18.4m although they turned a £ 67m loss into a £ 1.4m profit in 2012 , this is the first real sign that @entity0 are making progress without having to rely on the wealth of their billionaire @entity37 owner , and the cash bounty could enable @entity3 to bring in new recruits when the transfer window re-opens in order to cement what is already looking like becoming a successful title challenge			1
chairman @entity45 said : ‘ the club is naturally pleased to record a significant profit for 2013/14			2
by reaching the @entity49 semi-final and maintaining a challenge in the @entity6 until the final week of the season we demonstrated that , while improving our financial figures , we remained competitive in football ’s toughest club competitions			0
‘ we financed player purchases from sales as the squad for this current season was shaped , and our philosophy since mr @entity28 acquired the club in 2003 has been to build upon success on the pitch			2
' that is evident in the partnerships we signed and in our fanbase growth which contributed to the new record turnover figure and the profit made			2
we have done all of this at the same time as creating one of the world ’s leading football community programmes through the @entity73			0
@entity13 was sold to @entity74 in january in a £ 38million deal @entity14 left @entity0 for @entity76 this summer in a £ 50million move ‘ going forward , we have ambitious plans to build a pioneering global commercial programme , partnering with innovative and market - leading organisations from around the world			1
in the era of @entity8 , we must progress commercially to continue the circle of success to invest in the team and get results			0
’ meanwhile , the club are unlikely to move to a new stadium for at least seven years			0
after failing with a £ 300m bid for the site of the @entity93 power station , they are now looking at the possibility of expanding @entity95 , despite the fact it could prove far more costly			0
even if they agree on a new site , estimates suggest it would be five years before work began and a further two years to complete .			0
