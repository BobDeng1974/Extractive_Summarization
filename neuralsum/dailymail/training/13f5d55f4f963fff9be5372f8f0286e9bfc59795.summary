by @entity0 a parenting magazine editor has spoken out about the surprising backlash that ensued after she put a breastfeeding woman on the cover			1
@entity5 , who has edited @entity6 for 20 years , selected a powerful cover photo for the summer issue showing a topless mother in a @entity11 mask nursing her toddler son			1
' i thought the image invoked the unrealistic notion of the " @entity16 " who can do everything and countered it with the vulnerability of being partially naked with a small child , ' she wrote on the @entity21			0
too much ? @entity5 , the editor of parenting magazine @entity6 , has spoken out about the surprising backlash that ensued after she put a breastfeeding woman on the cover ( pictured ) but when she posted the cover on her @entity26 in the lead - up to the issue 's release , some people took issue with the picture , claiming it was too indecent to line the shelves of magazine vendors			1
facebook censors even attempted to remove the photo from ms @entity5 's timeline , despite the fact that she had previously posted a @entity40 cover with a much more visible nipple , and there was no backlash at all			1
' i was left to assume that it 's the breastfeeding that some people find offensive , ' she wrote			0
the photo is a self - portrait by artist @entity48 , who said its aim was to show the unique relationship between mother and child , ' where each being is complete by themselves but they are reinvented and strengthened by the relationships they establish with each other			1
' compromise : ms @entity5 was forced to produce two versions - an uncensored one for her subscribers and select bookstores , and one for vendors that had a red dot over the woman 's nipple ( pictured ) but vendors refused to see it that way			1
one distributor explained her reasoning to ms @entity5 , telling her : ' this is n't @entity73			2
open breastfeeding is not okay			0
' others asserted that it was n't the act of breastfeeding that was offensive , it was the fact that the child pictured is four , which is generally considered by @entity79 as too old to be nursing			2
but ms @entity5 feels that this belief is a product of our society 's ' squeamish ' attitude towards breastfeeding in general , since the average worldwide weaning age is between two - and - a - half and four - and - a-half			1
unfair attitude : ' nursing mothers face this every day when we try to feed our children in restaurants or in other public places , ' said ms @entity5 ( pictured ) by contrast , the average age a child is weaned off of breastfeeding in @entity79 is three months			2
' @entity79 attitudes about breasts and breastfeeding have to be at least partially to blame , ' she wrote			0
in any case , ms @entity5 was forced to produce two versions of the magazine - an uncensored one for her subscribers and select bookstores , and one for vendors that had a red dot strategically placed over the woman 's nipple			1
even though she says she ' did n't want even to entertain the ridiculous suggestion that it was in any way obscene , ' ultimately she decided that a censored issue was better than no issue at all			0
what 's more , she hopes the photo and the controversy it ignited will help start a larger conversation			0
' right now this is about an image of an artist breastfeeding on the cover of a magazine , ' she wrote			2
' but nursing mothers face this every day when we try to feed our children in restaurants or in other public places			0
' the two versions of @entity133 's summer issue were released on @entity134 .			0

when @entity6 editor @entity5 posted a photo of the cover on her @entity26 page , vendors *threatened* not to sell
the cover , a self - portrait by artist @entity48 , shows her wearing a @entity11 mask while nursing her toddler son
