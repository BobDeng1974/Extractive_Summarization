by @entity0 @entity1 has said he wants to spend ten years as deputy prime minister – and would refuse to prop up either of the main parties in a minority government			1
the @entity5 leader said if both @entity6 and the @entity7 failed to win a majority in next year ’s election , he would accept nothing less than another @entity11			1
he spoke as a @entity13 poll yesterday showed support for the @entity5 is at a feeble 9 per cent ahead of the @entity16 elections on may 22 – meaning the party could lose all 11 of its meps			1
coalition partners : @entity21 @entity20 and @entity5 @entity1 this lack of popular support suggests that if the @entity5 do enter a second coalition , they may be disproportionately represented in @entity26			1
mr @entity1 described coalition as a ‘ fascinating laboratory ’ of ideas and said : ‘ i ’d very much like to continue in government			2
’ figures close to @entity20 and @entity32 have privately said they wish to rule alone in the event of another hung parliament			0
but mr @entity1 said : ‘ my party would not be interested in propping up a minority government without coalition			2
it is n’t a role i would see as right for myself or the @entity5 ... we ’ve only just got started , and a ten - year period for us in government means we could make a majority contribution			1
the last thing i want to do is give up this job			0
’ he criticised @entity6 and the @entity7 for wanting to go it alone , saying : ‘ it ’s swashbuckling stuff , but when it comes down to it a minority government would be unstable			0
@entity50 , chief secretary to the treasury , spoke out against minority government last week - saying it was unstable ' we are still living in difficult times and difficult times require strong government , capable of taking tough decisions and with the majority in @entity26 to make sure they happen			0
’ the 2010 election ended in a hung parliament , meaning no party had a majority among @entity63			0
as a result , the @entity7 and @entity5 formed a @entity11			1
if there is a hung parliament again in 2015 , one option would be another coalition			0
the next step down would be for @entity6 or the @entity7 to form a minority government and enter a ‘ confidence and supply ’ agreement with a smaller party			0
the smaller party – the @entity5 – would not have ministers in the @entity77 , but would promise to help the government and to support it in a vote of no confidence			1
without this support , a minority government would be unable to get things done and could be forced to resign in a no confidence debate			0
mr @entity1 ’s comments indicate he would force a second election if he failed to get a coalition			2
he told a sunday newspaper that he wanted the @entity5 to be a ‘ political force in the life of this country – not just a think - tank ’			2
it means there will be no return to the @entity96 of the 1970s , when @entity5 @entity97 kept a minority @entity6 government in power			2
last week @entity50 , the chief secretary to the treasury , also spoke out against minority government , saying it is ‘ unstable ’ and would ‘ not be in the national interest ’ as it could not take tough decisions to protect the recovery			0
he will be in charge of negotiating with the main parties in the ‘ likely ’ event of a hung parliament , and said the @entity5 would be willing to form a coalition with either @entity6 or the @entity112 .			1

@entity1 claims he wants to spend ten years as deputy prime minister
@entity116 would *n't* take less than @entity11 if neither main parties won a majority
