by @entity0 published : 19:00 est , 13 june 2013 updated : 19:31 est , 13 june 2013 a year ago when @entity1 & @entity1 were heading for the finals of @entity4 ’s @entity3 , the worst they expected to be thrown at them were barbs from @entity7			1
his initial reaction , on seeing them , was that things could not get any worse			2
he then suggested @entity12 should dump @entity13 and go solo			1
at this year ’s final , @entity13 , seated without @entity12 , saw the egg - hurling incident during classical singers @entity17 and @entity19 ’s performance , but thought it was all part of the act and viola player @entity22 was throwing flower petals at the judges			1
hitting the high notes : the classical duo were one of the show 's underdog stories that captured the nation 's imagination ‘ i thought , “ oh , this is different			1
our act could have done with something like this last year			2
” then i realised it was egg on @entity7 ’s jacket			1
‘ i saw @entity17 and @entity19 afterwards			2
they were quite upset about it			2
they felt people would watch it to see the egg girl rather than watch them , but they were happy to have got as far as they did in @entity47			2
’ ‘ thankfully it was only eggs , ’ adds @entity12			1
‘ if the situation was more serious and they had a gun or something else that could do harm and i was there , i am a large guy , i would literally have fallen on them and they ’d be out of commission			2
’ for @entity1 , their own experience of the show has been life changing , but for 18 - year - old baritone @entity12 in particular , who had severe depression during his childhood , it may have helped to save his life			1
at their first audition in april 2012 they sang @entity69 and @entity71 ’s duet @entity70			2
@entity13 says : ‘ the difference between walking on stage with his head down and walking off with his head high was like watching a film			1
afterwards i thought , “ is this the same person ? he ’s so happy ! " ‘ i was probably bouncing around the room , ’ he says			2
‘ i had not felt that elated for a very , very long time			2
’ what a difference a year makes : @entity12 lacked confidence when he appeared on the talent show last year			1
he had suffered from depression upstaged : @entity22 took centre stage on this year 's final when she threw eggs at judge @entity7 ‘ that ’s when we realised , hang on , it was a good thing we applied , ’ says @entity13			1
‘ this will be good for us			0
’ @entity12 says : ‘ a year ago i had no direction in life and now it ’s insane the change that has happened			1
' i have grown out of my teenage angst			0
i am the same person but i feel different			0
like @entity98 , i have regenerated			0
’ @entity12 weighed 20st when he appeared on @entity47 , but he says now : ‘ i am on @entity101 and i have lost about 40lb , it is all on track and i ’m really happy			1
' my depression came from dealing with life			0
i feel i am better equipped for that now after the adventures we ’ve been through and all the stuff that ’s happened			0
‘ when i look back i understand why i felt that way			0
when you are in that mind - set it feels impossible to get out , you are upset about everything all the time , nothing seems bright or good			2
' being able to look back at that is something i thought i ’d never be able to do and i am just so glad i can			2
‘ no one thing triggered it , but it was pretty much about school — i never enjoyed it			0
‘ stress and how i deal with it has been a big part of my life			0
that ’s why i left school			0
i was n’t sure i could handle the stress of this , either , but it has turned out for the best			0
‘ i no longer see a psychiatrist and i feel stable and able to cope — which is crazy considering where i was a year ago			2
second place : @entity12 and @entity13 lost out on the top prize , but went on to sign with @entity7 's record label chart success : the pair 's first album reached no. 5 in the charts			1
they are going on their first tour and will be releasing a second album in october ' i am still on @entity140 , but my dosage has gone down considerably			0
the irony is that being in the spotlight has helped			0
’ though she plays it down , @entity13 is his guardian angel			1
you could see it in their first appearance where she rested a comforting hand on his shoulder , and sang his part when he joined in too early			0
‘ watching somebody come from such a low place to where he is now made me think i ’ve really had it easy , ’ she says			0
‘ he ’s made me appreciate things much more			0
’ says @entity12 : ‘ @entity13 has taught me to take no nonsense — she most certainly does not			1
‘ in the business we are in you could so easily get messed up and you just have to have the strength of will to stand your ground			0
’ turning to @entity12 , @entity13 adds : ‘ before going on the show i was probably one of the most unemotional people you could ever meet			1
i think you have only ever seen me cry twice			0
‘ i ’m not cold - hearted , i just could n’t express emotion except through my music , but the past year has made me more vulnerable and more able to be emotional in front of people			1
’ @entity13 faced a crisis of confidence at the start when @entity7 suggested @entity12 dump her because she would hold him back			1
@entity12 told him : ‘ we ’ve come on here as a duo			1
we ’re going to stay as a duo			0
’ she says : ‘ what happened in the first audition knocked me back			0
competition : last year 's winner was @entity187 and her dog @entity187 , who beat @entity12 and @entity13 to the top prize of performing at the @entity190 ‘ before we went on stage at the semi-finals , i could n’t stop crying and could n’t work out why			1
i realise now it was a panic attack			0
usually before we do a performance , @entity12 is very nervous and i ’m there relaxed in a chair ’			1
@entity12 and @entity13 met at school in @entity199 , @entity200 , when they were both 11			1
‘ we are like brother and sister , ’ @entity13 says			1
‘ i ’ve had a few marriage proposals , ’ adds @entity12 , not believing anyone could really be interested in him			1
‘ i ’ve stopped counting how many			0
i know it ’s in jest			0
i have n’t had a girlfriend for a very long time , two or three years			0
’ both live at home with their parents			0
@entity13 is funding a house extension and @entity12 is paying for his family ’s garden to be landscaped			1
meanwhile , they are excited about their second album @entity216 , which is due out in october			0
and next week they begin their first tour — backed by a 16 - piece orchestra , all playing live — with , they hope , no egg throwers among them			1
though if there is one , they ’d better steer clear of @entity12			2
@entity1 are on tour from june 22 - 29			2
for tickets , go to @entity227			0
