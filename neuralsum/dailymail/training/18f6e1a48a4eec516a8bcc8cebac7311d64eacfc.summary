as an @entity2 ‘ fan ’ , i ’m still buzzing about that win over @entity4 , while the coach in me is trying not to get too carried away			1
there is no question , however , that the result was huge leap forward for @entity11 ’s team - the night we started to see their @entity14 team and gameplan take shape			1
what a start to 2015 , which is @entity18			2
@entity2 were comfortably better than @entity4 and would have won by more save for a few errors			1
but most important of all , friday was also the night we saw a sea change in @entity2 ’s mindset and attitude and that ’s what excited me the most			1
it was like seeing boys suddenly becoming men			2
it all started with @entity31 and that stand - off in the tunnel before the game when he refused to lead @entity2 out until he got an assurance that @entity4 would follow within a minute			1
@entity2 captain @entity31 ( left ) set the tone for the match with his pre-match stand - off in the tunnel @entity31 cops a big hit from @entity4 hooker @entity41 during a massively physical 80 minutes in @entity42 @entity31 is congratulated by @entity2 forwards coach @entity43 following friday 's big victory @entity47 ( left ) , @entity31 ( centre ) and @entity46 worked brilliantly as a backrow triumvirate 8.00pm : @entity2 , led by @entity31 , leave their changing room and stand in the tunnel			1
8.01pm : meanwhile , in their half , the @entity52 replacements line the corridor waiting for the arrival of their starting xv			0
@entity31 , not keen to cede the advantage to @entity4 by waiting on the pitch , stands his ground in scenes reminiscent of 2003 when @entity61 refused to move to accommodate @entity62 on the red carpet in @entity64			1
8.02pm : referee @entity65 urges @entity31 and his side to take to the pitch			1
@entity68 has a word with his captain but he is unmoved , ball under his arm			0
8.03pm : the @entity74 cameras flick between disgruntled - looking @entity52 substitutes and @entity31 , who stares straight ahead with unblinking focus			1
8.04pm : @entity31 gives the nod to the panicking officials			1
@entity65 confirms if the @entity52 do n’t follow inside a minute , he has licence to head back to the dressing room			0
@entity2 leave the tunnel , on their own terms , and are greeted by boos from the crowd			1
8.07pm : two minutes after the scheduled kick - off time , @entity85 leads out @entity4			1
8.10pm : after two emotional anthems the game finally kicks off , five minutes late			0
@entity2 would n’t have been the first team to be left hanging out there for three or four minutes while @entity4 cranked things up and choreographed their big emotional entrance			1
they must spend days rehearsing all this nonsense			0
i loved that stubborn defiance even if some of my commentating colleagues thought it disgraceful ! it was brilliant , great theatre but very significant			0
let me assure you that all sorts of things kick off behind the scenes at @entity105 matches and you need to stand your ground			2
otherwise you will get trampled over or even bullied			0
one of my concerns about this @entity2 team had been that they are just a bit too ‘ nice ’ and accommodating , which can win you friends but sometimes lose you matches			1
for example , they let others dictate the itinerary of their summer tour of @entity118 which left them without half of their best players for the vital first test , which was always the key game			0
they are only now recovering from that			0
so , inwardly , i was cheering loudly when @entity31 played hardball and refused to make life easy for the @entity105 officials and tv people trying to hurry @entity2 on to the pitch for the scheduled 8.05 kick - off			1
there was more than a hint of @entity61 and memories came flooding back of @entity64 2003 , when @entity61 refused to move to the other side of the halfway line for the presentations with the @entity138 president			2
it ’s what champions do			0
no more @entity142 @entity31 ’s stance was absolutely justified as he sought assurance from the referee that @entity4 would be made to follow him out within a minute or he would take them back down the tunnel			1
and there was a bigger message there as well			0
‘ this is 2015 , this is our year , we are @entity2 and we are not going to be pushed around			2
no more mr @entity153 ’			0
@entity2 head coach @entity11 hailed his side 's 21 - 16 win against @entity4 as the best of his career fantastic			1
that ’s exactly the approach @entity2 must assume this year and i sensed a new bloody mindedness in their attitude on friday night from one to 15			2
this was just brilliant and the essence of competitive sport			0
it was a huge night for @entity31 and he came through with flying colours			1
@entity47 and @entity169 were my main contenders for man of the match but the @entity2 skipper was just half a stride behind them along with @entity175 and @entity176			1
he absorbed all the lessons and hurt from two years ago when @entity2 were humbled and made them into a positive			2
@entity31 led well and as a player he never falters , he goes the full 80 minutes and has an astonishing capacity for work			2
i have never doubted his place in the team , only his position , because i am sure he could go equally well at blindside or even no 8			0
but that debate is now over : openside flanker it is			0
@entity2 scrum half @entity169 controlled matters beautifully from the base against @entity192 's side as for @entity47 , his display at blindside is indicative of @entity2 ’s new approach			1
@entity47 is an aggressive , in - your - face player , the sort the opposition love to hate			1
he is pro-active and positive , whereas in the past @entity2 have been too defensive			2
with him and @entity31 in unison and @entity46 going well for the full 80 - the first time he has completed a @entity202 , which again was a big statement - the @entity2 back row definitely outplayed their much vaunted opposite numbers			1
the @entity205 connection behind the scrum it was n’t error free but it looked much livelier and i applaud the fact that the young @entity205 trio of @entity211 , @entity176 and @entity175 were picked for what they can bring to @entity2 ’s attack regardless of any perceived defensive frailities			1
when it comes to @entity202 rugby , players invariably raise their defensive games anyway			0
the @entity205 boys were all rock solid in the tackle and @entity175 , as well as taking his try brilliantly , has the all - round defence you would expect from somebody who plays regularly at full - back			1
@entity205 wing @entity175 ( left ) scored his first international try for @entity2 in friday 's win the 20 - year - old is mobbed by his @entity2 team - mates after scoring against @entity4 at the @entity233 @entity175 and @entity68 are developing a good rapport down the right and @entity176 ’s try is exactly what you would expect from a player with flair and a bit of x-factor			1
these young guns just need a platform			0
they are not miracle workers and they wo n’t produce magic every time , but give them enough possession going forward , over a period of time , and they will conjure up something very nice			2
@entity251 impresses me more with every game			0
he is not playing by numbers , @entity2 are letting him run the show and under intense pressure he produced a mature performance			2
that big match - clinching penalty at the end will have done his goal - kicking confidence a power of good			2
players remember moments like that when they present themselves again			0
( from left to right ) the @entity205 quartet of fly half @entity211 , lock @entity269 , winger @entity175 and centre @entity176 brought their excellent club form to the @entity233 medical matters away from @entity2 for a moment , i was a concerned with the handling of two @entity4 injuries			1
@entity276 picked up a horrible bloody cut to his face and clearly need to come straight off and get the wound sorted with haemostats , stitched and bandaged up properly			0
@entity281 was on the bench as a straight blood replacement and it was a nonsense delaying the game and trying to treat @entity276 on the pitch			0
the referee should have insisted he leave the field of play			0
as for @entity291 , to these eyes he clearly picked up a concussion in the second half after an accidental clash of heads with @entity41			0
the slow motion showed him go limp , which is usually the giveaway sign , and he looked very groggy			0
yet he was allowed to continue			0
@entity291 copped a boot to the face from @entity269 in the first half and then appeared to be knocked out after a clash of heads with @entity41 ( above ) but , incredibly , the @entity52 winger finished the match on the pitch i welcome the news that the world governing body - @entity309 - are demanding a report from the @entity311 on the assessment of @entity313 during the game			2
he also suffered a kick in the head in the first half and went off for eight minutes			0
it ’s not a matter of establishing any ‘ guilt ’ - if there is any - but we must make sure rugby has its protocols correct and we are implementing them properly			2
unfortunately , rugby seems to believe it is leading in this area but still lags behind other sports in its approach to player welfare when it comes to injuries			0
there is nothing more important than an individual ’s health and we have too many players getting injured now			0
why ? @entity2 's stars celebrate their brilliant win against @entity4 in the changing rooms			1

@entity2 's 21 - 16 victory againt @entity4 was a huge step forward for this side
we started to see @entity11 's gameplan take shape in @entity42
@entity31 laid down a *marker* with his stand - off in the tunnel
@entity47 and @entity169 were my contenders for man of the match
@entity175 and @entity176 were also outstanding
