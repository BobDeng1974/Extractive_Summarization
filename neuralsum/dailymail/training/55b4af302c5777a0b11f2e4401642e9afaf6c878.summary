@entity5 was just six months old when his right eye began to look shiny , due to a tumour called a retinoblastoma			1

deadly : @entity5 was just six months old when his right eye began to glow , due to rare cancer called retinoblastoma glowing : his mother @entity9 caught a glance of the tumour when he turned his head at an angle , unaware that she was looking at a potentially lethal disease ordeal : @entity5 's cancer was so advanced that the only treatment available was to have his whole eye removed , to ensure the disease did n't spread any further she said : ' it was like a cat 's eyes that you see on the road			1
you would look at him and see it , and then look again and it was n't there			0
' only i noticed it to begin with and then others began to pick up on it			2
we thought it was just light reflecting in his eye			2
' people sometimes pick it up on photograph as the person appears to have a white eye , rather than a red eye that you might otherwise see			2
' but after being referred to a specialist eye clinic , doctors confirmed @entity5 was suffering from retinoblastoma , a type of eye cancer that affects just 40 - 50 children each year in the @entity57			1
the disease generally develops in children under the age of five , however some are born with it			0
it develops in the cells of the retina , the light - sensitive lining of the eye			2
symptoms of retinoblastoma can include an abnormal appearance of the pupil , which tends to reflect light as a white reflex			0
surgery : @entity5 aged 11 months , covering from the operation to remove his eye at @entity77 rare : @entity79 , the type of cancer that @entity5 ( pictured here with mother @entity9 ) was suffering from , affects just 40 - 50 children each year in the @entity57 replacement : after losing his right eye , @entity5 ( with father @entity87 ) was fitted with an artificial one some children have a squint , however less common signs are a deterioration of vision , a red and irritated pupil without infection or a change to the colour of one iris			1
' i sobbed my heart out when they told us , ' said mrs @entity102			0
' they said we were very lucky to spot it			0
' the only treatment available at this stage of development for @entity5 was to have his whole eye removed to ensure the cancer did n't spread any further			1
the youngster , from @entity111 , underwent the operation at @entity77 when he was just 11 - months old			0
his father @entity113 , 34 , said : ' it seemed harsh and it was tough making the decision to take out our son 's eye but we had to be blunt about it			0
' they had to put him under and remove the eye , but it meant the cancer would be totally gone			1
' while retinoblastoma is easily treated if caught early , failing to remove the eye in time can cause it to spread down the optic nerve			1
@entity5 will be given replacement artificial eyes as he gets older and his eye socket expands hope : @entity5 's mother @entity9 is now trying to raise awareness of the rare condition ' @entity5 had a category d tumour so it was very big , ' said his mother , a pe teacher			1
' they only go up to category e so we knew it was something we just had to do			0
' they fitted @entity5 with an artificial eye so that the nerve endings can be attached to it			1
it 's a small porous ball which a shell is fitted on top of , like a big contact lens			0
' as @entity5 's cancer was retained within his eye , he did n't have to undergo any follow - up treatment such as chemotherapy			1
he will be given replacement artificial eyes as he gets older and his eye socket expands			2
mrs @entity102 said : ' it 's amazing how they can make bespoke eyes for your child			0
if felt like i had got my son back seeing him with two eyes again , it was all a very surreal experience			0
awareness : the family now wants other parents to check their children 's eyes ' the artificial eyes are very realistic and they will make as many as we want until we find one that looks as good as possible for @entity5			1
' she is now using her experiences with @entity5 to help raise support for the @entity175 ( @entity176 ) , a charity dedicated to supporting families affected by retinoblastoma			1
' i just want other parents to go and get their children 's eyes checked and make the disease more widely known , ' she said			0
@entity5 's father @entity87 , a finance director , added : ' if @entity9 had n't spotted his eyes shining , it could have been a very different outcome			2
we feel so lucky that everything has worked out so well			0
