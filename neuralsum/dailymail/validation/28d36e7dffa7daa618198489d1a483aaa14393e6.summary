@entity0 insists @entity1 have the characters in their dressing room to put the club 's reputation as perennial bottlers to bed and qualify for the @entity8			1
spurs face @entity14 at @entity15 on saturday , six points behind fourth - placed @entity10 but with two of their top four rivals in @entity13 and @entity10 set to face each other at @entity17 on sunday			1
and @entity0 says he is desperate to change the perception of @entity1 as the sort of team that fail to live up to their expectations after defeat by @entity24 in the @entity26 final this month			1
@entity0 is sick of @entity1 being known as bottlers and wants to help change their reputation @entity1 lost 3 - 0 at @entity30 against @entity10 last weekend to dent their top - four hopes ' we can change the reputation , i really think so , ' @entity0 said			1
' we have a really young team and people can still develop into something better			0
hopefully , it will go in the right direction and , definitely , we have to show we can be a team to cross the line			0
' it helped that we played the final , with the pressure			0
everybody got in the mood and i do n’t think anybody wants that feeling of losing again – exhausted and still just moaning because we could have done better			0
that helped everyone to take a look at what is needed at the top level and in important games			2
' while many are almost counting @entity1 out of the race for the @entity8 after a run of form that has seen them take just seven points from a possible 15 in a crucial period in the @entity62 , @entity0 still believes @entity64 's young side can find themselves at @entity67 's top table next season			1
@entity1 have already lost the @entity26 final to @entity24 this season earlier this month at @entity70 @entity0 , @entity71 and @entity72 ( @entity73 ) look dejected , knowing they had beaten @entity24 earlier this year ' we ’ve still got nine games to go , ' he told the @entity77			1
' you lose one game and you are supposedly out of it			0
you win one and you are in again			0
so , hopefully , we will keep winning and we will see where we are			0
' everybody who has played in the @entity8 knows that the feeling is different			2
right now you sit at home and you watch it on the tv , and then you speak about it the next day			0
it ’s just about the @entity8 , " did you see this ? did you see that ? " it gives you such a boost to play in the @entity8			2
' the former @entity98 playmaker wants to get back into the @entity8 after experiencing it in @entity100 @entity64 's young team are rank outsiders in the race for the top four but still hold some hope			1
