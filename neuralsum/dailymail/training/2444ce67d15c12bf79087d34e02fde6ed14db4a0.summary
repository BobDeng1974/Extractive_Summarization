by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 05:31 est , 8 january 2014 updated : 11:04 est , 8 january 2014 @entity4 could become home secretary in a future coalition , friends have claimed the @entity8 ’ economic guru has ’ given up ’ his dream of being chancellor of the exchequer , admitting that the larger coalition party should take charge of the @entity13			1
aides moved today to insist the business secretary was not eying @entity17 's job , as @entity19 @entity18 predicted he would be a ' complete and utter disaster ' if put in charge of the country 's borders			1
@entity8 @entity4 would like to home secretary to change the direction of the coalition 's immigration policy which he fears his damaging business and universities as the @entity8 shadow chancellor in opposition , many had assumed mr @entity4 would have taken a job at the @entity13 when the coalition was formed in 2010			1
but his relationship with conservative @entity36 was so bad he was instead handed the @entity37			0
he regularly launched attacks on mr @entity36 ’s economic strategy , most recently warning the chancellor ’s flagship help to buy scheme to get more people on the property ladder risked fuelling a new house price bubble			0
however , mr @entity4 has also been outspoken about the @entity19 target of cutting net migration to the tens of thousands , warning of the impact on attracting highly - skilled immigrants and foreign students			1
one source told @entity1 that mr @entity4 would be open to the @entity55 job ' because of the migration thing ' and suggested he had ' given up on the @entity13 '			1
another source insisted mr @entity4 did not want mrs may 's job but added : ' he has real concerns about the way the rhetoric on immigration is affecting business and universities			1
’ however , the idea of the senior @entity8 taking charge of @entity69 's law and order was dismissed as laughable but the conservatives			0
@entity19 mp @entity71 said : i think @entity4 is an idiot			1
if you want to have unlimited immigration then i am sure @entity4 would be a completely brilliant home secretary			2
' but for the vast majority of the public it would be a complete and utter disaster			2
’ fellow conservative @entity82 thought the idea was a joke : ‘ is it @entity85 yet ? i thought we had only just had @entity81			0
’ deputy prime minister @entity86 has complained of having to intervene in policy rows with home secretary @entity17 on an ' almost daily basis ' mr @entity4 reignited coalition tensions on immigration yesterday after warning @entity92 ’s target would not be met			1
he said : ' setting an arbitrary cap is not helpful , it almost certainly wo n’t achieve the below 100,000 level the @entity19 have set , so let ’s be practical about it			0
’ meanwhile , mr @entity86 no longer views as mr @entity4 as a threat to his leadership , but expects him to play a key role in the next election campaign			1
‘ @entity4 has been put back in his box , ’ said a senior @entity8 source			2
another source close to mr @entity86 said : ‘ the danger to @entity86 ’s leadership has passed , he is in a stronger position than he has been at any point in the coalition			0
if the @entity8 demanded the @entity55 in a coalition deal with @entity111 , shadow home secretary @entity112 would have to be found another job ‘ at the end of the day @entity4 will be part of the team up to the election and beyond			1
’ there is little chance of mr @entity4 becoming home secretary in this coalition , but it could be a key demand of any future coalition talks			0
making the @entity55 a dealbreaker for a future - power sharing deal would be hugely contentious for both @entity111 and the @entity125			2
it would mean the @entity125 ditching mrs may or @entity111 leader @entity128 not keeping @entity112 in the job she currently shadows			0
mr @entity4 has repeatedly clashed with current home secretary @entity17 , warning curbs on numbers coming to @entity69 would cause ‘ enormous damage ’ particularly to universities which rely on income from overseas students			2
the @entity8 have grown increasingly frustrated with the @entity19 - dominated @entity55			1
deputy prime minister @entity86 complains of having to intervene in policy disputes with mrs may ‘ on an almost daily basis ’			0
the political battles escalated when @entity8 @entity141 , who claimed @entity142 covered up the death of government weapons adviser dr @entity144 , implicated the security was made a @entity55 minister by mr @entity86 in october ’s reshuffle			2
with @entity111 ’s poll lead over the @entity125 narrowing , a hung parliament looks increasingly likely in 2015			0
mr @entity86 is being urged to consider demanding control of one , big government instead of spreading ministers too thinly across @entity154			0
a @entity156 source said : ' @entity17 is an excellent home secretary			0

@entity8 business secretary has given up hope of becoming chancellor
but now has eye on the @entity55 after row with @entity125 over immigration
reignited tensions with warning @entity19 net migration target not realistic
@entity169 say they no longer see @entity4 as a leadership threat
@entity19 *mps* predict @entity4 in charge of borders would be an ' utter disaster '
