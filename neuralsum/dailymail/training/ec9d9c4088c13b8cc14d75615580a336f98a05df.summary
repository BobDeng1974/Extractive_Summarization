a mother who was told by doctors that her unborn son was so ill she should have an abortion is celebrating after her baby boy has made a miracle recovery - and come home from hospital for the first time			1
@entity9 ignored doctors who told her that her baby had ' no chance ' of survival , and refused to terminate her pregnancy , @entity15 was born with his heart on the wrong side of his body , disconnected valves , and twisted bowels - and @entity9 was assigned a bereavement midwife			1
' happy chappy ' : @entity9 and @entity23 with their firstborn @entity15			2
the 17month - old recently left hospital @entity15 's mother was assigned a bereavement midwife , but the baby boy battled through but after more than a year of medics battling to save baby @entity15 , the 17 - month - old tot has finally left hospital for good - and has gone home to live with @entity9 and dad @entity23 for the first time			1
@entity9 , 22 , from @entity34 , @entity35 , said : ' doctors told me time and time again that @entity15 would have no chance , and i should consider an abortion			1
' but he 's an angel sent from above			2
he 's my first child and i just felt i wanted to keep him			2
' @entity9 and @entity23 , 25 , were told repeatedly by doctors that @entity15 ' had no chance '			1
but the problems they forecast did not materialise , although @entity15 was kept in hospital for several weeks after his birth in september 2011 and had to be returned there in december 2011 , where he has stayed until being allowed home on wednesday			1
@entity9 was even given a bereavement midwife after the birth , but little @entity15 was a fighter			1
he still has a number of health problems and his airways are kept clear with a tracheostomy attached to a ventilator , which he had to use all the time			0
one of his kidneys has also not properly formed and is inside his abdomen			0
it has to be checked every fortnight because it can stop and start working at any time			0
@entity15 is on a ventilator at all times to help him breathe @entity9 said she it was heartbreaking watching her friends with their own children , knowing that @entity15 was still in hospital			1
she and @entity23 , who are both full time carers for @entity15 , are looking forward to spending more time with their little boy			2
they were told @entity15 might never walk but @entity9 said they constantly have to keep an eye on him as he can crawl and tries to stand up			2
she added : ' he 's such a happy chappy			0
he loves @entity76 from @entity77 and is always bouncing about			0
' he needs watching constantly as sometimes he tries to pull out his tubes			0
it 's challenging but i would n't have it any other way			0
' i look past the tracheostomy now , i do n't see it any more			0
if it was n't there , you would never know			0

@entity9 was *offered* a termination after doctors said baby had ' no chance ' of living a full life
she refused and gave birth to @entity15 who had heart on wrong side of his body
he spent first 17months in hospital but has now been allowed home
