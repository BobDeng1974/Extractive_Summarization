scientists believe the first complex conversation between humans took place around 50,000 to 100,000 years ago			1
much of it , they say , involved cavemen grunting , or hunter - gatherers mumbling and pointing , before learning to speak in a detailed way			0
but in a new study , one linguist argues that human language developed rapidly with people quickly using complex sentences that sound like our own			1
scientists believe the first complex conversation between humans gradually took place around 50,000 to 100,000 years ago			1
much of it , they believe , still involved cavemen grunting , or hunter - gatherers mumbling and pointing , before learning to speak in a detailed way ' the hierarchical complexity found in present - day language is likely to have been present in human language since its emergence , ' says @entity26 , professor of linguistics at @entity28			1
most scholars believe that humans first started using a ' proto - language ' , which was a primitive kind of communication with only a gradual development of words and syntax			1
but according to professor @entity26 , single words bear traces of syntax showing that they must be descended from an older , syntax - laden system , rather than from simple , primal utterances			1
' since we can find syntax within words , there is no reason to consider them as ' linguistic fossils ' of a prior , presyntax stage , ' he adds			2
in a new study , one linguist argues that human language likely developed rapidly with people quickly using complex sentences that sound like our own			2
pictured is a reconstruction of of @entity58 men			0
remains from this species have been dated between 300,000 and 125,000 years ago professor @entity26 has a different theory about what created human language			1
he says humans combined an ' expressive ' layer of language , as seen in birdsong , with a ' lexical ' layer , as seen in monkeys who utter isolated sounds , such as alarm calls			1
the ' integration hypothesis ' suggests that whatever first caused them , these layers of language blended rapidly			0
in his paper , professor @entity26 writes that a single word today can be ' internally complex , often as complex as an entire phrase , ' making it less likely that words we use today are descended from a presyntax mode of speech			1
' nationalisation ' for example starts with ' nation , ' a noun ; adds ' - al ' to create an adjective ; adds ' - is ( a ) ' to form a verb ; and ends with ' - tion , ' to form another noun , albeit with a new meaning			0
' hierarchical structure is present not only in single words , but also in compounds , which , contrary to the claims of some , are not the structureless fossilised form of a prior stage , ' he says			1
the researchers arrived at their conclusions by conducting a series of experiments in teaching students the art of ' @entity108 stone - knapping ' the very first rudimentary communcation between our ancestors took place much earlier , say one group of scientists			0
earlier this year , researchers argued that cavemen initially began communicating 2.5 to 1.8 million years ago - and they were talking about @entity117			1
the international study found stone tool - making drove the evolution of language among our human ancestors in the @entity125 savannah			2
it suggests communication among our earliest ancestors may have been more complex than previously thought , and that tool - making helped drive evolution			2
the researchers , who included scientists at the @entity132 and @entity133 , arrived at their conclusions by conducting a series of experiments in teaching students the art of ' @entity108 stone - knapping '			0
this is when butchering ' flakes ' are created by hammering a hard rock against certain volcanic or glassy rocks , like basalt or flint			0
@entity108 stone - knapping dates back to the @entity144 period in eastern @entity125 , and remained largely unchanged for 700,000 years until more sophisticated @entity146 hand - axes and cleavers were developed			2
in testing five different ways to convey @entity108 stone - knapping skills to more than 180 college students , the researchers found that the demonstration that used spoken communication – versus imitation , non-verbal presentations or gestures – yielded the highest volume and quality of flakes			0
the same analysis applies to words in romance languages that have been described elsewhere as remnants of formless proto - languages			0
in @entity166 , ' porta asciuga - mani ' - literally ' carry dry - hands , ' but today colloquially meaning ' towel holder ' - is one such case , where a compound derived from old words has a clear internal structure			0
researchers think the integration hypothesis could generate a productive set of research questions			0
@entity177 , a professor of linguistics at the @entity179 in @entity180 , @entity166 , who edited the paper , calls it a ' very interesting ' critique of the idea that human language developed gradually			2
however , professor @entity177 suggests there is an ' intuitive difference ' between cases where words assemble to form either a compound word or a sentence			0
he believes it is possible that studies of the concept of ' symmetry - breaking , ' a potentially distinctive part of sentence formation , ' may offer new empirical data to test the hypothesis and shed light on the birth of human language			1

complex human conversation began around 50,000 to 100,000 years ago
professor @entity26 notes single words bear traces of syntax
he says this shows the words came from an older , syntax - laden system
he believes humans combined an ' expressive ' layer of language , as seen in birdsong , with a ' lexical ' layer , as seen in monkeys
