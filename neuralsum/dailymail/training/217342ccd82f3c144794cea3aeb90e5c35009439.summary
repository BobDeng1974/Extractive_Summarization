by @entity0 for the @entity1 @entity2 will today tell @entity4 voters not to use their referendum to rid themselves of the @entity7 - led government ... because he says he ’ll win the general election			1
the @entity10 leader will claim the @entity7 are ‘ on their way out ’ in an attempt to persuade his party ’s traditional voters to reject independence			1
the latest opinion polls show up to 30 per cent of @entity10 ’s natural supporters may be ready to switch allegiance and back @entity21 ’s plan to break up @entity22			1
pledge : pro-union campaigners @entity2 and wife @entity24			2
the @entity10 leader will today make a series of pledges to shore up support for the @entity29 vote many are thought to have been wooed by the @entity32 ’s message that a vote for independence would mean @entity4 would no longer be ruled by @entity36 @entity7 ministers sitting in @entity37			1
now , in a speech at @entity39 in @entity40 , mr @entity2 will make a series of pledges in a bid to shore up the no vote			2
the tone of the speech is in marked contrast to the pro-union campaign so far , which has seen the @entity7 , @entity10 and @entity48 working closely together			1
it is understood the new tactic was signed off by @entity7 strategists within the @entity53 campaign			2
winning over undecided @entity4 in @entity10 heartlands such as @entity55 is seen as crucial to reviving the no campaign , which has seen its lead slip from 22 percentage points to just six in one month			1
mr @entity2 will say that ‘ as prime minister ’ in eight months ’ time he will tax bankers ’ bonuses , raise the minimum wage , introduce a new higher rate of tax and abolish the so - called bedroom tax			2
‘ the @entity32 want to tell you we ca n’t defeat the @entity67			1
they are wrong , ’ he will say			0
‘ change is coming in the @entity22 – the @entity67 are on their way out			1
they are losing their mps , they are defecting , divided and downhearted			0
a @entity10 government is within our grasp			1
with that election in just eight months ’ time the change @entity4 needs is on its way			0
electing a @entity10 government is the way to change @entity4			1
’ poll shock : @entity21 , pictured with @entity81 - branded cakes , has seen his side rocket to 47 per cent of the vote he will claim : ‘ we will abolish the bedroom tax			0
abolish it in @entity86 , in @entity55 , but also in @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity89			0
’ the attack on the @entity67 comes after the leader of the @entity4 conservatives played down her party ’s chances at the next election			1
during a tv debate on tuesday , @entity96 said : ‘ @entity98 [ a @entity7 victory in may ] is n’t looking likely by the polls , but we are trying our best			0
’ the comments were read as an attempt to persuade @entity4 to stay in the @entity22			2
mr @entity2 , @entity103 and @entity104 were accused of complacency at @entity58 ’s questions yesterday , as the main parties were urged to ‘ drop everything ’ and fight for a no vote			0
@entity7 mp sir @entity110 said : ‘ if we were to lose the @entity113 , it would be not only a disaster for @entity4 , but a national humiliation of catastrophic proportions			1
‘ i say gently to the three party leaders that perhaps we have been a bit complacent up to now			0
i urge them , over the next two weeks , to drop everything else and stand shoulder to shoulder to fight for the @entity113 that we love and believe in			1
’ mr @entity103 replied : ‘ the leaders of the parties in this @entity123 have all put aside their differences and said that , in spite of the political differences we have , we all agree about one thing : not only is @entity4 better off inside the @entity22 , but the @entity22 is better off with @entity4 inside it			0
’ of the 650 mps in @entity37 , 59 represent @entity4 seats ; @entity10 , which accounts for 41 of these , would be the hardest - hit by a @entity81 vote			1
without @entity4 , the @entity67 would have had a 21 - seat majority at the 2010 election			1
@entity10 still would have won majorities in 1997 , 2001 and 2005			1
the @entity135 ’ campaign has been boosted by two polls in the last week , which both suggested 47 per cent of decided voters will back independence , compared with 53 per cent who will vote no. mr @entity21 ’s former policy chief yesterday claimed that @entity32 insiders now believe they can win the referendum by snaring 55 per cent of the voters			2
both sides in the independence battle are stepping up pressure in the central belt , dominated by @entity148 , as shown in this map of the 2010 general election result this could lead the @entity22 into a eurozone - style crisis , @entity152 has warned			2
its analysts said @entity4 independence was still unlikely , but ‘ could have severe consequences ’ for the @entity22 and @entity4 economies			0
‘ the most important specific risk , in our view , is that the uncertainty over whether an independent @entity4 would be able to retain sterling as its currency could result in a [ @entity167 - style ] currency crisis occurring within the @entity22 , ’ wrote @entity159 , a senior economist at the bank			0
he also warned that an independent @entity4 would face much higher borrowing costs , and be forced to cut public services			0
separating @entity4 from the rest of the @entity22 after a @entity81 vote could take years , a former cabinet secretary has warned			0
@entity173 told @entity174 it would be ‘ a bigger task than i ever had to face ’ , adding : ‘ it is a major exercise trying to unpick a constitutional settlement built up over 300 years			0
’ @entity173 , who was the top civil servant from 2002 to 2005 , cast doubt on @entity32 leader @entity21 ’s claim that it would only take 18 months for @entity4 to become fully independent			2
‘ i very much doubt it , ’ @entity173 said			0
‘ he wants it done in a year and a half			0
the rest of the @entity188 ... why should they dance to that deadline ? ’			0

*labour* leader will say conservatives are ' on their way out '
he will hope to persuade traditional @entity10 voters to stick with the @entity113
if it were *n't* for @entity199 , @entity67 would *'ve* won majority in 2010
