by @entity0 published : 10:34 est , 5 march 2013 updated : 13:10 est , 5 march 2013 a pointer called @entity2 has been identified by historians as the first ' pedigree ' dog			1
the team , from the @entity7 , found a description of the dog in an 1865 edition of the @entity12 journal , @entity13			1
it is believed that this was the first time that an attempt had been made to define a dog breed standard based on the animal ’s physical form			1
@entity20 , who wrote under the pseudonym ' @entity22 ' , paved the way for the pedigree dog breeds we know today with his description of @entity2 ( pictured ) @entity20 , who wrote under the pseudonym ‘ @entity20 ’ , paved the way for the pedigree dog breeds we know today by creating a system of giving scores for different parts of the dog ’s body			1
his aim was to solve the bitter disputes that were brewing over the seemingly arbitrary decisions of judges at dog shows which could see a dog win a class one week and then come last the next			1
in september 1865 , @entity20 published a classification for the @entity1 which gave its head and neck 30 points , frame and general symmetry 25 , legs and feet 20 , quality and stern 15 , and colour and coat 10			2
the historians who discovered @entity2 are based at the @entity53 and the @entity54 – both at the @entity7			0
professor @entity55 , who was involved in the research , said : ‘ the standard set by @entity2 must surely be one of the most important milestones in the 6,000 - year - old relationship between canines and man			2
the pointer - experts say it may have been the first ' modern ' dog breed defined by its physical form ‘ as dogs came to be defined as ' breeds ' , they were bred for greater conformity to breed standards , which meant more inbreeding , and more health problems as dogs were bred from a smaller gene pool			2
‘ @entity20 ’s classifications set in chain a process where dogs were re-imagined , redesigned and remade			0
’ @entity20 's aim was to solve the bitter disputes that were brewing over the seemingly arbitrary decisions of judges at dog shows ( @entity2 is pictured ) dr @entity82 added : ‘ @entity20 was so impressed by @entity2 when he saw drawings of the dog – and heard it had won a prize at a @entity88 show – he devised the classification			1
‘ there ’s a historical theme in the way many of these breeds were created			0
for example , though bull baiting had been banned in 1830 , the @entity94 was bred to form considered to be ideal for grappling with a bull , for example , a protruding lower jaw to grab the soft nose of bull			0
’ before the 1860s , types of dogs were defined by what they did , not how they looked			0
pointers were gun dogs , valued and bred for their ability to find game and , though a recognisable type , came in a variety of sizes and colours			0
but in the show ring they were expected to have a defined shape that aspired to the ideal set out in the breed standard			2
@entity2 signalled a new age where dogs were increasingly bred for their form and from their pedigree			0
the emphasis on conformation to breed types spread rapidly to other countries , where @entity129 dog shows were emulated and @entity129 dogs imported as foundational breed stock			1
dr @entity132 said : ‘ @entity22 ’s classification is n’t used today , its principle of defining a breed and judging by conformation will be the main criterion in the show ring at @entity139 ’s this week			0

@entity2 was described by @entity20 in an 1865 edition of @entity13
it is believed to have been the first attempt to define a dog breed standard
@entity147 was aiming to end *disagreements* over the judging at dog shows
