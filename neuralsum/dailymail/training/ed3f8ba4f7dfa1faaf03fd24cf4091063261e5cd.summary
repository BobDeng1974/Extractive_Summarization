it ’s a lesson women the world over have had to learn the hard way			0
wear the wrong pair of high heels , and that fierce strut could be transformed into a weak hobble within a matter of hours			0
now one @entity10 - born artist has come up with a solution that could prevent women from kicking off their heels in frustration			2
the graduate took a look at impact absorption , studying traction , durability and shoe weight , before adding different springs , rubber components , pneumatic hydraulics and metal rings			1
as the wearer takes a step , each of these components works together under their body weight to create a natural balance in movement			1
the @entity46 graduate developed her designs as part of the @entity50 collection			0
‘ i wanted to create pieces of art based in a functional concept , using high technology processes and handcrafting , ’ she told @entity51			2

‘ i wanted to create pieces of art based in a functional concept , using high technology processes and handcrafting , ’ she told @entity51 ‘ technically , the challenges were to achieve the quantity the movement required according the body weight without losing stability , ' she said the graduate took a look at impact absorption , studying traction , durability and shoe weight , before adding different springs , rubber components , pneumatic hydraulics and metal rings			1

‘ the [ is a new system developed for the industrial partner that i worked with , allowing regulation of the absorption effect depending on body weight , ’ said ms @entity16			1
as the wearer takes a step , each of these components works together under their body weight to create a natural balance in their movement the engineering components were developed alongside an unnamed industrial partner , allowing regulation of the absorption effect to be changed depending on body weight			1
each design is handmade ms @entity16 ’s designs are n’t subtle , and she did n’t intend them to be			2
‘ the principal functions of footwear are often sacrificed in fashion , ' she said			0
‘ the mechanism can be bespoke according to bodyweight			0
the final outcomes are a representation of introducing mechanical concepts to traditional footwear			0
’ the artist made the shoes by hand using traditional tools such as machine cutting and leather work , alongside modern technology including laser cutting and 3d printing			0

hydraulic heels were created by @entity17 - based artist @entity16
she studied impact absorption , alongside weight , traction and durability
heels include springs , rubber balls , pneumatic hydraulics and metal rings
as the wearer takes a step , each of these different components work together under wearer *'s* body weight to create a balance in movement
while the designs are currently part of an art project , ms @entity16 hopes they may inspire a commercial product in the future
