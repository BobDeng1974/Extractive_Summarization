by @entity0 last updated at 4:03 pm on 20th january 2012 dramatic footage of a @entity3 crew member telling passengers to ' go back to your cabins ' has emerged			1
the plea came despite the luxury liner being fatally holed and underlines the chaotic situation in the moments after the ship struck rocks			1
holidaymakers wearing red life jackets can be seen milling on the deck of the @entity3 in the mobile phone footage which was posted on @entity19 newspaper @entity18 's website			2
emergence of the footage came as a cook from the ship said captain @entity24 had ordered dinner at 10.30pm - nearly an hour after the liner struck rocks at 9.41pm			1
scroll down to see the videos ... calling for calm : this crew member may have asked passengers not to panic , but it came after the ship had struck rocks chaos : a crew member tried to calm passengers down who stood in the ship 's corridors wearing lifejackets disaster : an incredible aerial shot of the doomed @entity3 shows just how far it has listed onto its side questions have already been raised as to the slow response from captain @entity24 in waiting more than an hour to abandon the stricken 290m @entity3			1
and the footage confirms passenger accounts of how they were told to return to their cabins sending some of the victims to certain death			0
the film also again underlines how @entity57 and his crew were still insisting that the situation was all down to a ' electrical black out '			1
but by then he knew that the ship had suffered a 70m gash in its hull after hitting a reef off the coast of the @entity19 island of @entity67 as he sailed past too close in a mad moment of showing off			2
debris : a bench engraved with the name of the grounded @entity3 has washed up on the shore rescue effort : firefighters approach the stricken cruise liner as stormy weather sees the search being called off over fears the ship could slip from its rocky resting place busy : @entity19 firefighters have scoured the doomed @entity3 as they try to find the 21 missing people service : @entity84 , @entity67 parish priest ( centre ) prays with @entity87 bishop @entity86 during a @entity88 on the harbour next to the @entity3 further light has been shed on what happened to the youngest person still missing from the doomed @entity3			1
@entity93 , five , and her father @entity94 have not been accounted for since the ship ran aground last friday			2
but a children 's entertainer has revealed the @entity99 girl was part of a group of eight youngsters he took charge of after they were separated from their parents in the chaos			2
@entity107 , who was at the time dressed as @entity109 , shepherded them to a quiet corner , organised them into a chain and led them hand in hand to the deck			0
he told the @entity117 : ' we heard the signal to abandon ship			2
we went down to @entity121 , the pickup area , where i divided them up according to which muster station they belonged to and helped them find their parents			0
' but some of the children , including @entity130 , whose mother ( top right ) was pictured on @entity67 yesterday , became lost in the chaos			0
the female crew member is seen telling passengers in @entity19 : ' the situation is under control			1
go back to your cabins			0
we ask you that you all return to your cabins			0
' once the electrical problem is sorted out everything will be back to normal shortly			0
we are resolving the problem			0
' however , just 30 minutes after the video was shot cowardly captain @entity57 eventually gave the order to abandon ship			1
but by then it was too late as the ship had begun to list too far over for the lifeboats to be launched safely and passengers had to make their way down the superstructure of the hull using rope ladders			2
this morning the search was called off after movement was detected by lasers pointed onto the ship and it was deemed too dangerous for the dive teams to carry on the hunt			1
there are still 21 people still missing , who are believed to be lying in muster stations on decks submerged below the water			1
a total of 11 people have been confirmed dead			1
the main concern for teams working on the ship is the weather , as although they have been lucky in the week following the tragedy the forecast is for strong winds			2
relentless : scuba divers have searched large swathes of the stricken ship over the last five days as hopes fade of finding any more survivors looking : divers have had to postpone their efforts several times amid fears they could become trapped shipwreck : the main concern for teams working on the ship is the weather , as although they have been lucky in the week following the tragedy the forecast is for strong winds the ceremony of the ' salute ' ( inchino ) - where captains sail dangerously close to shore - appears to be widespread among captains of @entity19 cruiseships			1
@entity202 publication reported ' it has become frequent in @entity203 to be dazzled by the sight of one of @entity207 's giant ships blaring its horns a few hundred metres from shore '			2
@entity19 environment minister @entity212 spoke out about the manoeuvre , and made it clear it will no longer be tolerated			0
the fear is that it could whip up waves around the @entity3 and shift it further - even possibly dislodging it from the rock shelf it is resting on			1
fire brigade spokesman @entity222 said : ' the search was suspended at around midnight because movement was detected			1
' it was thought best to pull the dive teams out and we are now deciding the best course of action			0
' the revelation that @entity57 had ordered dinner at 10.30pm - less than an hour after the liner struck rocks at 9.41pm - was made by ship 's cook @entity234			1
claims : @entity238 ballerina @entity24 ( left ) was seen ' cavorting ' with captain @entity24 on the bridge defended : captain @entity24 ( left ) has been defended by @entity24 ( right ) illuminated : the @entity3 lights up the @entity242 coast last night as rescue efforts were suspended once again he told @entity246 tv station @entity245 : ' we wondered what was going on			1
' at that time , we really felt something was wrong			0
' the stuff in the kitchen was falling off shelves and we realised how grave the situation was			0
i have had 12 years of experience as a cook on a cruise ship			2
' i have even witnessed fires , so i was n't that scared			0
but i did wonder , though , what the captain was doing			0
why was he still there ? ' investigators are looking into the role played by the owner of the @entity3 as the order to abandon ship was delayed by 68 minutes			1
they are looking in particular at the requirement that , once the order is given , each passenger is entitled to € 10,000 euros in compulsory compensation			0
it would mean a € 30million bill for the 3,000 tourists			0
@entity207 declined to comment on the compensation allegations			0
but it has labelled itself as an ' aggrieved party ' in what could be one of the biggest maritime claims in history			0
it has also suspended captain @entity24			2
prosecutor @entity283 has also said that the only suspects were @entity24 and the second officer @entity285			0
suspension of the search comes after it was revealed @entity238 ballerina @entity24 , 25 , was seen cavorting with @entity57 on the bridge of the ship in the minutes before his cruise liner foundered on rocks			1
@entity19 authorities believe @entity57 - dubbed captain @entity295 - may have been distracted from his command by trying to impress the dancer who they now consider to be a ' key witness '			1
miss @entity300 , who has a two - year - old daughter , had worked as a translator for the @entity3 but was on holiday on the ship at the time of friday night ’s disaster			2
she has now defended the captain , who she told @entity238 tv had ' saved over 3,000 lives '			1
she also said she was summoned to the bridge to help translate for the evacuation of @entity313 passengers			0
prosecutor @entity283 declined to comment on @entity19 media reports that ms @entity300 was being sought as a witness			0
@entity57 is under house arrest and faces possible charges of manslaughter , abandoning ship and causing a shipwreck			1
he admitted he made an unauthorised detour from the programmed route that caused the vessel to slam into a reef and capsize off the @entity242 island of @entity67			0
hard at work : the ship is at risk of completely sinking in the next few hours yesterday an audiotape of the doomed vessel 's first communications with maritime authorities showed the ship 's officers continued to report only an electrical problem for more than 30 minutes after hitting the reef			1
seven of the 11 dead were also identified yesterday by authorities - four @entity339 passengers , one @entity341 and one @entity19 passenger and one @entity344 crew member			1
@entity19 passenger @entity345 , who would have been 86 next week , was buried in @entity346			0
