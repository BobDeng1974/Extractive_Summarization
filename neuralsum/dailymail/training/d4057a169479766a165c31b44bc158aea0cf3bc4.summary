@entity0 is to switch back to a conservative approach after admitting to an attempt at creativity that failed ahead of this weekend 's inaugural @entity5 @entity4			1
looking for any edge he can gain over @entity8 team - mate @entity7 in their battle for this year 's formula one world title , @entity0 tried something different in the second practice session at the @entity14			1
after finishing just 0.065secs quicker than @entity7 at the end of the first run , @entity0 ended the second almost a second down on the 29 - year - old @entity17			1
reflecting on his day 's work , and a circuit he rates as ' very enjoyable ' and ' cool to drive ' , @entity0 said : ' that was a very productive day from an engineering point of view			2
' the team decided to go two different ways in terms of set - up			0
i took a very creative set - up for my car in the second session , which did n't work out			2
' so we will go back to the conservative way for tomorrow , because we saw @entity7 was very quick with that			1
' @entity0 admitted after the practice that he will revert back to a conservative approach for qualifying @entity0 crosses the finish line during his session practice session ahead of the @entity5 @entity4 @entity7 , who holds a 10 - point lead over @entity0 after a run of three successive victories , immediately appeared at home on the track			1
a happy @entity7 said : ' i like the new circuit			2
it 's got really good grip and great corners , with a lot at medium speed			0
' as for the car , that felt really good			0
we 've quite a good balance , so there are a lot of boxes ticked , but we still have work to do to see if we can improve for tomorrow			0
' as for @entity76 's @entity75 , the only other driver in with a shout of denying @entity7 or @entity0 the title , it was a tough day at the office			1
the @entity81 , 73 points behind @entity82 , finished down in 13th , almost 2.5secs off the pace			0
worse still was the fact @entity75 's second session ended seven minutes early as he was forced to pull his car to the side of the track with an engine issue he suspected was looming anyway			0
@entity90 , who drives for @entity8 , during his friday practice session at the picturesque @entity14 track @entity75 said : ' it was our last friday with that engine , so it 's not a worry that she turned off at the end there			1
' we tried a few settings and we 're not so fast here , the straights are long and we 're suffering a bit			0
' @entity75 revealed he has not been focused in the wake of @entity107 's accident in @entity108 on sunday that has left the @entity109 fighting for his life			1
' after what happened in @entity108 , you try and do the best you can , ' added @entity75			2
' i would be lying if i said other things were n't on my mind , but you do what you can to make sure you 're 100 per cent committed to driving and that 's the best way for our job and our headspace			0
' it 's the best way , but it was tricky and not as easy as i expected			0

after the first practice session , @entity0 was 0.065 seconds ahead of his @entity8 teammate @entity7
but after a creative approach to the second practice session , @entity0 finished nearly a second down on the @entity24 driver
@entity0 admits he will now switch back to a conservative approach
the @entity28 world has been *rocked* by the crash of driver @entity107 in @entity108 last week , who is still in a *critical* condition in *hospital*
