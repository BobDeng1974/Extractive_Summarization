@entity1 , 25 , was nearly three times the drink drive limit when she drove for around seven miles at a snails pace along the @entity5 towards @entity13 , @entity14			1
when she was eventually stopped after seven calls to police from other motorists @entity1 stunned officers by admitting she thought she was on her way to @entity20 , around 55 miles away in the other direction , to speak to an ex-boyfriend			1
she travelled for much of her 38 minute journey along the hard shoulder ' at walking pace ' and she had so much to drink that she could not remember what she had done			0
@entity1 , from @entity27 , @entity28 , admitted dangerous driving and drink driving at @entity31 and could have faced up to two years in jail			1
she was given a six month sentence suspended for 18 months and was banned from the road for two years			1
she was also ordered to pay Â£ 350 costs			0
judge @entity36 said she could go free because of her previous good character and the fact she was an ' impeccable person and popular teacher '			1
after the case @entity41 , of the @entity42 said : ' the judge 's ruling is an abysmal decision and as far as i am concerned sends out totally the wrong message			1
i would call for a minimum five year ban and a jail sentence			1
' a short suspended sentence shows the courts do not take drink driving seriously enough			1
driving on the wrong side of the road can have catastrophic consequences			1
' this woman is a teacher and is a role model to young people			1
what sort of message does the sentence send to those pupils ? ' earlier @entity64 , prosecuting , said the alert was raised on may 12 at midnight after police received seven telephone calls saying @entity1 was travelling in her @entity68 along the @entity5 heading towards @entity13 on the wrong side of the carriageway			1
she added : ' an officer was deployed and it transpired that the vehicle was first seen in the vicinity of @entity75 of the @entity76 at 11:37pm , seven miles from where eventually she was stopped			1
' a pc @entity81 travelled in the third lane and saw the defendant travelling towards him at walking pace , the vehicle was stopped and the defendant appeared dazed and confused and smelt strongly of intoxicants			1
' she provided a positive breath test at the roadside of 97mg in 100 ml of breath			0
in interview she could give little explanation as to how she came to be travelling on the wrong side for such a long period			2
' she said that earlier in the day @entity1 had travelled from @entity94 to @entity95 and had been drinking on the train			1
she had then gone for a meal in @entity98 , @entity95 , and drunk more alcohol before setting off in her car			0
mrs @entity64 said : ' @entity20 is a journey which she says she had taken many times because her boyfriend lived there			1
there was no accident but the aggravating features are the length of time travelling in the wrong direction , she was on the road from 30 odd minutes , and the level of drink consumed			1
' @entity1 admitted dangerous driving and drink driving at @entity31 ( pictured )			1
she was given a six month sentence suspended for 18 months and was banned from the road for two years in mitigation the court heard @entity1 works for charity @entity118 , which trains graduates to become inspirational teachers working in areas of deprivation			1
she was working with several schools in @entity95 , mainly in @entity124 , alongside staff teachers to raise aspirations of pupils as well as their grades			0
defence lawyer @entity129 said : ' on that morning she had absolutely no intention of driving that day			2
she had travelled back on the train to @entity95 , she lives in @entity98			0
' it is a miracle there was no accident or even a near miss. it could have had terrible consequences not only for others but also yourself ' - judge @entity36 ' she had a couple of drinks on the train but had no intention of driving , she then went for a meal with her sister			2
following an argument , she had little recollection of anything after that , whatever possessed her to get in her car she does n't know			0
' she is genuinely remorseful and grateful for the court allowing her to graduate			0
she is clearly an excellent student with @entity118			0
she is clearly an asset to the education system and parents say she has turned their children 's behaviour around			0
she is a popular teacher			2
' she is aware that there is a custodial risk			0
she can see that it is such a serious offence which clearly crosses the custodial threshold			0
i ask you to suspend any custodial sentence			2
' there was no excessive speed , she travelled little over seven miles the wrong way but it had taken her 38 minutes to do so			2
she has no recollection of the travelling			0
' she must have travelling extremely slowly because it has taken her so long			0
there was no accident , she must have been crawling along the hard shoulder , it is an unlit road			2
' one can only assume she was on the hard shoulder			0
thankfully there was no accident and no one has been hurt , she could have killed others and herself			0
' the impact of an immediate custodial sentence would be highly catastrophic			2
she has not touched alcohol since the offence			0
' @entity186 , judge @entity36 , told the teacher : ' it is clear that you were driving for some considerable distance while completely unfit to do so			1
' it is a miracle there was no accident or even a near miss. it could have had terrible consequences not only for others but also yourself			0
' it was a serious case of dangerous driving			2
the other side of the coin is that you are an impeccable person and have become a popular teacher			2
it is clear you have a great deal of support and it is very much to your credit that you recognise the problems you have and have been addressing that			0
' this case clearly crosses the custodial threshold but i have come to the conclusion to suspend because of your good character			0
