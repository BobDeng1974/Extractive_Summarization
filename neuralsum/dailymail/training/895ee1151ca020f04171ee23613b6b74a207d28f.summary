the prime minister attacked the ‘ snobbery ’ of those who denigrate qualifications such as golf course management and music studies			2
he said that , in fact , these courses could lead to decent jobs - and were therefore just as valuable as many of the more academic subjects offered by colleges			2
aiming for the future : prime minister @entity1 with apprentices @entity18 and @entity20 at the @entity21 where he told an audience that the nation needed more young people with vocational qualifications mr @entity1 , who never used the term @entity3 degrees , made his comments at an event celebrating apprenticeships in @entity30			1
he said that , too often in the past , @entity31 has pushed students into university when what the country needed was more people with vocational qualifications			1
the prime minister praised @entity39 , which does much more to ensure that people get the type of education suitable for them			2
speaking at a @entity45 plant , he said : ‘ for many years there ’s been a snobbery in this country about some degrees			0
investment : @entity1 argued that the introduction of tuition fees meant students were now much more picky about which courses they go on - because they have to contribute more towards them ‘ they were called music studies or golf course management and people thought there must be something wrong with these degrees			1
‘ frankly we ’re now going to find out which degrees really benefit people			0
it will get rid of that snobbery			0
’ mr @entity1 said the introduction of tuition fees meant students were now much more picky about which courses they go on - because they have to contribute more towards them			1
this means students weigh up which courses will benefit them in the long run - meaning that only the best will survive			1
courses such as golf course management could turn out to be the ones most likely to land people a good career , he said			1
‘ because there are some students who make a bigger contribution on fees , i think quite rightly students are more fussy what it is they ’re putting themselves in for , ’ mr @entity1 said			2
‘ they ’re saying before i sign up for this degree i want to know how many lectures i ’m going to get , what quality teaching i ’m going to receive , and whether this degree will help me get a good job			0
‘ that ’s a very good thing			0
“ where does this leave me in terms of a qualification that will help me to get work ? ”			0
