by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 04:28 est , 1 october 2013 updated : 04:55 est , 1 october 2013 regrets : dame @entity3 told an audience at @entity5 of things she missed @entity7 must find a way of convincing the public that delving into private data is of paramount importance to national security or risk fueling the popularity of ' self - seeking twerps ' @entity15 and @entity17 , the former head of the organisation said			1
dame @entity3 , who was director general for @entity7 between 1992 and 1996 , said that terrorists are using increasingly sophisticated methods to communicate and conceal their plans , and so intelligence services must have the tools to keep one step ahead of them to avoid atrocities like the @entity28 mall massacre			1
to do this , she said , they must be allowed to gather data on a large - scale - but the public need more assurances that this is necessary and is being carried out with proper supervision			1
speaking at the @entity5 on monday , the @entity35 reports the real - life former 'm ' , as saying : ' it is very important for our intelligence services to have the kind of oversight that people can have confidence in , so that we can be quite sure that in giving them these powers we know that they are being properly supervised and scrutinised in the way they use them			1
' it may be that we need something more complex to convince the nation that the intelligence services are actually working on their behalf and not acting against them			1
' she argued that many mistakenly believe that whistleblowers @entity15 and @entity17 , who have released classified information to the public domain , are revealing something scandalous			1
she added : ' i think adequate oversight could explain to us all that in a way that is not being explained and therefore @entity15 and @entity17 would be seen for what they are - self - seeking twerps			1
' the mother - of - two also told how she sometimes regrets juggling her hectic career with her young family , as she often regretted missing out on ‘ sports day ’ and ‘ school plays ’ because of the real life drama in the office			1
dedicated to her job , @entity75 claimed she would later be wracked with guilt as she explained to her children why she had n’t made an appearance			1
criticism : dame @entity3 has labelled @entity81 founder @entity15 as a ' twerp ' for releasing classified information into the public domain she said : ‘ i had so many moments where i would worry about being late for the sports day or late for the meeting because i was at sports day			2
‘ it was perpetual really , you take a day off because your child is in the school play and then some drama will happen at the office			2
‘ i still had to go home and explain to my child why i did n’t make it			2
‘ there were a number of things i missed - i wish i could go back too			2
‘ when they were growing up relied hugely on nannies and grannies			2
’ now a thriller writer , @entity75 was the first female and first public director general of @entity7			1
@entity75 said women today still struggle to juggle their homes and their work , claiming she is disappointed and unimpressed by the lack of progression for helping working mothers			2
she added : ‘ i look at women in the work place now and i feel incredibly sad that the environment has n’t changed more			0
‘ it should n’t still be difficult for women to juggle their family and their work life in 2013			0
the same problems should n’t face women today			0
‘ i thought by the time my daughters were to be mothers that they would n’t be faced with the this problem			0
‘ the government has previously promised to sort out child care and but it has failed			0
the 78 - year - old was director general of @entity7 between 1992 and 1996			1
she relied on nannies for her children this snap was the first photo taken of @entity75 after she became @entity7 head , trying to keep a low profile ‘ there has been various promises that every borough , every town was going to have child care and they have n’t followed that up and it ’s a great same			1
‘ it is still just as difficult as it was back in our day to have satisfactory arrangements			0
‘ and for our generation it is very sad to see and disappointing after everything we worked to change			0
‘ i really thought the world would have adapted better by now			0
‘ i think having women in senior positions is very important			0
having a female home secretary is important			0
it is important women are in these positions to understand what women need in their homes			0
’ @entity75 was invited to the festival to promote her latest novel @entity161			0
a grandmother to five grandchildren she separated but never divorced from her husband @entity164 in 1984 .			0
