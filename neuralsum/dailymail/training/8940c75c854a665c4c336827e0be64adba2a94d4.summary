it reveals how the cost of divorce for a married couple , or a separation for a couple who were living together , has ' soared ' since it carried out the same investigation eight years ago			1

by 2014 , it has jumped to around £ 44,000 per couple , a rise of 57 per cent			1

a common extra bill is the cost of childcare as a result of separation , typically costing £ 4,300 a year , such as a mother needing to return to work or take a second job			1
one in eight women said they ' worked longer hours or took a second job ' following a break - up			0
one in ten , who did not work before the split , got a job			0
the report reveals how separating couples are also prone to ' splashing out ' on items to treat themselves during such a difficult period in their lives			1
one in eight ' took a holiday to celebrate their newly - single status ' , typically spending nearly £ 2,000 on the trip			2
others buy ' new clothes , jewellery and have a makeover ' to try to cheer themselves up or sharpen up their look if they are feeling downcast about their appearance , typically spending £ 1,500			0
the report was based on interviews with 616 adults who have been married or co-habited with a partner within the last decade , but subsequently split up			2

the percentage of so - called ' double divorcers ' has almost doubled since 1980			0
