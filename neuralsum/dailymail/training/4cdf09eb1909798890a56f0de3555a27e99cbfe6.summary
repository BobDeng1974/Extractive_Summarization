by @entity0 for @entity1 fears of a massive volcanic eruption in @entity4 have been fuelled by yet another earthquake which has shifted 50million cubic metres of molten rock towards another volcano			1
it has been reported that a magnitude 4.5 quake hit a volcanic system close to the @entity13 volcano in the early hours of this morning with experts warning it could link up with the @entity17 volcanic system and cause a huge eruption			1
it comes after an earthquake reached a magnitude of 5.7 yesterday , potentially leading @entity4 to yet again bring the warning code to red level			1
experts say it is difficult to predict if volcanoes will erupt , however they say 50million cubic metres of molten rock has moved over the last 24 hours			1
professor @entity42 , from the @entity43 told @entity44 : ' we know there is a lot of molten rock sitting under the ground beneath @entity17 , which is a major volcanic system			0
if this molten rock hits that , we know it is likely to trigger it to erupt			2
' but who knows , it may just stop			0
it is still at five kilometres depth , and it is possible it could freeze there and not a lot more will happen			0
' if it keeps going north , it keeps feeding molten rock and it hits the @entity17 system and triggers that - then goodness knows what will happen			2
it could make a lot of disruptive ash all over @entity4			1
' on sunday , @entity4 lowered its warning code for possible volcanic disruption to the aviation industry to orange from red , the highest level on the country 's five - point alert system , after concluding that seismic activity had not led to a volcanic eruption under the glacier			1
trembling times : although the earthquake has not caused an eruption , there are fears of a repeat scenario of the @entity35 ash cloud in 2010 bad boom : the 2010 eruption of a volcano under the @entity35 glacier , pictured , severely disrupted @entity37 air travel for several weeks after ash spewed into the atmosphere red alert indicates an eruption is imminent or underway with a significant emission of ash likely			1
@entity100 scientists believe the earthquakes are a result of magma flowing out from under the crater of the volcano , causing a change in pressure			1
‘ we still ca n't say whether it will cease , continue like this for a while or erupt			0
it 's impossible to say , ’ @entity108 , a geologist at the @entity109 said			0
there have been thousands of smaller quakes over the past week at @entity13 , and areas around the volcano , in the centre of the @entity118 island nation , have been evacuated			2
however , before an eruption air travel will not be affected , a spokesman for the @entity123 @entity122 said last week			2
' the ( @entity123 ) @entity100 will be monitoring what 's occurring			0
they will be sending out forecasts about the atmosphere and any ash in the air , ' he said			0
' if the eruption does occur we will issue what 's called a notice to airmen informing them of the conditions			0
it 's then up to the airlines with their safety teams and experts whether to fly			0

yet another earthquake hits close to the @entity13 volcano in @entity4
quake has caused 50million cubic metres of *underground* magma to move
raised fears it could link up with another volcano causing a huge eruption
warning code currently on orange level but could be brought to red
it is feared an eruption could lead to a repeat of the 2010 ash cloud chaos
the @entity35 eruption disrupted around *100,000* *international* *flights*
