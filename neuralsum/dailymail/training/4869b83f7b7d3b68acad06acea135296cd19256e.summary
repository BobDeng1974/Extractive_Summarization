by @entity0 published : 11:47 est , 8 may 2013 updated : 19:50 est , 8 may 2013 rags to riches : @entity3 boss @entity2 who won his application to strike out a compensation claim by his ex-wife in the 21 years since his divorce from @entity8 , former hippy @entity2 has built one of the @entity11 ’s biggest green energy companies and made millions			1
meanwhile miss @entity8 – a woman said to have a penchant for penniless men – has struggled financially			0
yesterday her attempt to claim a £ 2million share of mr @entity2 ’s fortune was thrown out by a court after a judge said the @entity21 traveller turned wind farm tycoon was not ‘ her insurer against life ’s eventualities ’			1
senior family judge @entity27 added that she had left her claim – amounting to around £ 100,000 for every year since she divorced him in 1992 – far too late			1
the judge , sitting with @entity31 and @entity32 in the @entity33 in @entity34 , allowed mr @entity2 ’s appeal against the @entity37 ’s refusal to strike out miss @entity8 ’s claim			2
lord @entity31 said : ‘ in the family context , there is no statutory bar to bringing a claim for financial relief ten , 20 or even 30 years after the divorce			0
‘ nevertheless , the court should not allow either party to a former marriage to be harassed by claims for financial relief which are issued many years after the divorce and have no real prospect of success			1
' it must be an abuse of the court ’s process to bring such proceedings			0
the present case is a classic example of such abuse			0
’ the court heard that the couple married in 1981 , when miss @entity8 already had a daughter from a previous relationship , and lived largely on benefits			1
they had a son but separated after only three years			0
mr @entity2 , 51 , was later living in an old ambulance when he made a wind turbine out of retrieved and recycled materials to generate his own energy			2
mr @entity2 with his £ 1million electric supercar : his ex-wife @entity8 claimed she tried and failed to get him to pay her maintenance and child support grand : the £ 3million , 18th - century fort occupied by @entity2 , who had faced a £ 125,000 legal bill from that grew @entity3 , which he founded in 1995			1
mr @entity2 ’s legal team argued that when he and @entity83 were divorced his unlikely business empire was years in the future and he had hardly a penny to his name			1
the money he subsequently made has allowed him to indulge his love of sports cars and he now lives in £ 3million , 18th century @entity90 , near @entity91 , @entity92			1
he has remarried and has a four - year - old son			2
living the high life : mr @entity2 , centre , now runs a successful business @entity3 which is worth several million in contrast @entity83 , 53 , of @entity97 , is said to have travelled to a hearing in the case last month by getting up early to use the bus and sleeping in the bus station			2
lord justice @entity27 said yesterday of @entity83 , who found a new partner in 1993 with whom she had two children : ‘ @entity105 has been the experience of all the wife ’s adult life			0
both the men with whom she has entered into family life were seemingly equally impecunious			0
‘ her husband was the most improbable candidate for affluence			0
she can no doubt appeal to his sense of charity but in my judgment he is not to be compelled to boost her income			0
’ ' considerable enterprise ' : mr @entity2 in the @entity120 set up a wind energy business with a new girlfriend that developed into @entity3 , now a massive player in the @entity11 's eco energy sector , with over 70,000 customers			2

@entity2 today won court battle against wife claiming financial support
he says he had *practically* no income when the couple divorced in 1992
now he lives in a £ 3million 18th century fort in @entity91 , @entity92
the pair have a son and a step - daughter born in her first marriage
