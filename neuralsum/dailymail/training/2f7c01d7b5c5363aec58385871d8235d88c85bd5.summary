the wrinkled man , who said he was 90 - year - old @entity8 , stunned passers - by as he leapt between pillars and bounced off walls in the sleepy @entity13 town of @entity14			1
little did they know that they were in fact watching 27 - year - old professional freerunner , @entity18 , performing stunts for a video he was making			1
a cardigan , specs and balding head with wispy hair were enough to make the athletic young man completely convincing			2
@entity36 , who is a professional free - runner , then took to the streets of his home town of @entity14 , @entity13 , dressed as his character mr @entity8			1
mr @entity18 is a member of the well - known freerunning group @entity18 , who filmed the stunt to make a video to encourage people to exercise			2
he said : ' the prank worked best when we performed it just once or twice and quickly moved on , leaving people looking puzzled			0
' the guys i was with told those who asked that i 'd invented free - running and was still obsessed with staying healthy and in good shape			0
mr @entity18 put some work into fooling his audience , puffing and panting and pretending his back hurt not what the shoppers of @entity14 were expecting : mr @entity18 ran up a wall and did a backflip not your average 90 - year - old : mr @entity18 filmed his stunts for a video that will encourage people to exercise @entity18 as he usually looks , left , and how he looked with the prosthetics and make - up applied , right ' at the bottom of the escalator i really built up the tension , making it look like i would struggle to even walk up it			1
' i think it ’s fair to say people were more than a little surprised when i then climbed it on my hands			0
' @entity78 , also known as parkour , involves performing gymnastic stunts on street furniture and buildings , and has its origins in late 1980s @entity84			0
mr @entity18 , who has been freerunning for 13 years , also visited a local gym , where he impressed personal trainers with his dead - lifts , flips , and pull - ups			2
he said : ' " @entity8 " added to the illusion by limbering - up before each jump and dramatically holding his lower back as if it was stiff whenever he landed			0
leaping over benches at the shopping centre , mr @entity18 drew some gasps from the afternoon crowds mr @entity18 has been a freerunner for 13 years - he said he enjoyed doing stunts dressed as a 90 - year - old quite sprightly ! @entity18 has been a freerunner for 13 years and says anyone can do it after his make - up session mr @entity18 made a fairly convincing arthritic old man - until he did a backflip ' the reaction we got from the public was incredible : people of all ages were clearly fooled and dumbfounded			1
' some just stared for several seconds questioning if they could believe their eyes			0
' video director @entity113 , 24 , said : ' a few elderly people bought it , and it was funny how the younger generation really fell for it as well			0
' we filmed their reaction and they were wondering who the old guy was jumping off benches			0
' mr @entity18 's exploits were filmed in his hometown of @entity14 for his professional freerunning team @entity18 it took three hours with a professional make up artist to transform the young athlete into an old man			1
