an @entity1 at one of @entity4 's largest universities has promoted a video claiming the execution of drummer @entity7 in @entity8 was a hoax cooked up by the state , it was revealed today			1
hours after the death of the soldier , 25 , a @entity14 student group at @entity15 ( @entity16 ) circulated a @entity18 film arguing the crime was manufactured using ' fake blood '			1
the six minute video called ' @entity8 false flag b * * * * * * *			1
masses are in a state - sponsored trance ' , has been viewed by 300,000 people , and says that @entity27 detectives investigating the murder were @entity29 who were in on an @entity31 conspiracy			1
the film even claims that traumatised witnesses were in on a hoax , taunting those who tried to comfort @entity7 as he lay dying by saying : ' these women look very traumatised lol ( laugh out loud )			2
' @entity15 has previously admitted it would consider ending the sale of alcohol on campus in case it offended @entity14 students			2
see an edited extract of the video below message : this video promoted by members of the @entity48 claims that the death of @entity7 was a state conspiracy using ' fake blood ' problems : the @entity1 is run by students from @entity15 ( pictured ) , which has distanced itself from the film last year border officials also stripped the institution of its right to sponsor @entity60 students , leaving thousands at risk of deportation , amid fears many were on courses there just to get a @entity4 visa			1
members of its @entity68 , who also posted the video on its @entity73 page , have previously called non-muslims ' evil ' and heaped praise on the @entity76			0
the video shows news coverage on the day of @entity7 's death , including his alleged killers covered in blood and holding weapons			1
over the pictures are subtitles , arguing his death was a conspiracy , including one asking : ' where is the blood on his hands that is seen on most of the other videos ? '			2
as a reporter describes the scene in @entity8 the film says : ' now add some fake blood and a fake media whore ( reporter ) talking s * * * , stating the obvious just in case you do n’t get it and we got the made up news lol			1
' it later says : ' i need proof and not fabricated ‘ bs ’ ( b * * * * * * * )			2
' it then cuts to a police officer telling the public to ' move back '			0
the subtitles then say : ' yes listen to the masonic copper , move back before you film anything incriminating against their false flag charade			2
' conspiracy : the film has been seen by more than 300,000 people and argues the killing was ' fabricated ' hoax : the film , that appeared on the @entity123 , pinpoints several moments they say proves the terror attack was bogus a witness then describes what he saw , and the subtitles say : ' makes sense to you ? sounds staged to me ! ! ! ... are you buying this ? '			1
the film 's maker then goes on to pinpoint areas where fake blood was smeared by conspirators			1
it raises more questions about whether @entity4 's universities are being targeted by religious extremists bent on radicalising students			0
tragic : drummer @entity7 died in the street as he walked back to his barracks in @entity8 , but @entity147 says the @entity148 teaches that there should be no sympathy for non-muslims poignant : a woman looks at floral tributes left for @entity4 soldier @entity7 where he died almost a fortnight ago ' that a video like this was shared by students the day after a soldier was killed like that on @entity162 ’s streets is deeply concerning , and highlights the ease with which social media allows material like this to be accessed , ' @entity154 , of anti-extremism think - tank student rights , told the @entity167			1
' we ’ve seen in the past how students can be led towards violence by online material , and for this reason university authorities should be increasingly aware of this kind of activity			0
' the @entity15 today tried to distance itself from the video			2
' the university is committed to ensuring all its students are free to study in a safe and secure environment , ' a spokesman said			0
' the views expressed by individual students or student societies , including on social media , do not represent those of the @entity15			0
' today the university added : ' @entity188 , and its @entity1 , would like to make it clear that the views represented on the @entity18 videos referred to in the media do not represent the views of the @entity194 or its @entity1			0
' the @entity195 and @entity1 understand that these videos were not produced , edited or posted to @entity18 by members of the @entity1			0
links to these videos were , however , posted on the @entity73 site by an individual user and we apologise for the offence this has caused			0
' the links were removed from the @entity73 site on friday may 31			0
@entity194 and its @entity1 condemn the events in @entity8 in the strongest possible terms			0
