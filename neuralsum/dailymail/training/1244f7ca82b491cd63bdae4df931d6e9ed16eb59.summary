the head of the @entity1 has described the destruction of @entity3 as ' beyond description ' as he visited the city today following the war between @entity7 and @entity8 this summer			2
@entity9 was shown entire neighbourhoods of @entity3 which were flattened during bombing by @entity7 , just as efforts at rebuilding the city got underway			2
@entity9 was also shown @entity15 tunnels used to attack @entity7 soldiers , calling them ' shocking ' , and adding that @entity7 citizens should not have to live under the threat of missile strikes			1
@entity9 said the destruction he saw in @entity3 was ' much more serious ' than what he witnessed in the @entity27 territory in 2009 in the aftermath of a previous @entity7 - @entity15 war			1
@entity9 said the tunnels were ' shocking ' adding that @entity7 should not have to live under the threat of @entity15 missile strikes the @entity1 leader said he came to the territory with ' a heavy heart ' and told @entity7 and @entity27 officials that ' there is no hope for the long - term stability of @entity3 without addressing the underlying causes of the conflict			1
' two months after the war ended in a stalemate , border restrictions remain largely in place , but today marked the arrival of the first construction materials allowed through @entity7 's blockade			1
@entity7 has agreed to a un-monitored system to allow the entry of construction materials , and over the weekend the international community pledged $ 2.7 billion in reconstruction aid			0
@entity7 , which controls the main cargo crossing into @entity3 , called tuesday 's effort a ' pilot ' initiative , still wary that building materials could be used by @entity15 to rebuild its military infrastructure			1
the @entity1 is monitoring the use of construction materials that pass through the @entity7 border crossing , to ensure the materials are not diverted for @entity15 military purposes			2
@entity69 , the @entity70 coordinator for goods imports to @entity3 , said 75 trucks of cement , aggregates and metal supplies were entering @entity3 - double the daily average in 2013			0
in another move aimed at reconciliation , the @entity7 army said it will allow @entity3 farmers to sell produce to the @entity82 for the first time since @entity15 took over @entity3 in 2007			0
the export ban was one of the most painful restrictions crippling @entity3 's economy , because the @entity82 used to be the tiny coastal territory 's main export market			0
in a sign of growing international support for the @entity27 , @entity9 met with ministers of the new @entity27 unity government in @entity3			0
learning curve : during his visit , @entity9 also visited schools that are being run by the @entity1 as part of a relief effort to help support the thousands left homeless by @entity7 's bombing campaign this summer @entity9 talks to @entity27 @entity102 who was wounded in @entity7 attacks on @entity3 peace : @entity9 used the visit to appeal to both sides to address the underlying reasons for the conflict in order to prevent it from happening again though @entity7 has denounced the @entity27 government because it is backed by @entity15 , @entity111 governments have signaled a willingness to work with it			1
later , @entity9 also visited southern @entity7 communities that have been battered by years of @entity3 rocket fire and consoled the family of a 4 - year - old boy killed during the war			0
the military also gave him a tour of the one of the underground tunnels that @entity15 built to attack @entity7 civilians - the discovery of which prompted @entity7 's ground invasion in @entity3			2
@entity1 vehicles are seen parked outside a school while @entity9 visited while in @entity3 today flattened : whole neighbourhoods in @entity3 were destroyed during @entity7 bombing this summer in a conflict which left 2,100 @entity27 dead on the mend : rebuilding efforts began in @entity3 today after the first shipment of construction materials were allowed through by the @entity7 blockade @entity9 's visit came amid fresh waves of criticism of @entity7 policies as @entity140 's parliament voted monday to recognise an independent @entity27 state			1
while the prime minister abstained , and half of @entity145 did not vote , the symbolic gesture was designed to send a message to @entity7 about its approach in @entity3			0
the vote should have no tangible effect on @entity140 foreign policy			0
but @entity140 's ambassador to @entity7 warned it symbolizes a trend that should worry the jewish state			0
healing : @entity7 has also lifted a ban on @entity3 farmers selling produce on the west bank which they have not been allowed to do since @entity15 took control of the city in 2007 rebuilding : while @entity7 are fearful that building materials will be diverted by @entity15 to rebuild military infrastructure , they have agreed to allow in cement and metal under @entity1 supervision change : @entity7 's slackening of import and export rules around @entity3 reflect a wider global political change towards sympathy with @entity8 following the conflict this summer			1

@entity9 said destruction of @entity3 is ' much more serious ' than in 2009 conflict
@entity15 tunnels were ' shocking ' and *condemned* missile strikes on @entity7
