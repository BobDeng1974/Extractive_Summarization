bigger is better for car passenger safety claims a new study that has identified the @entity3 500 as the most dangerous car to have a crash in			1
the @entity7 research shows that the sub-compact car has the highest insurance rates for policies that pay for injuries to passengers in an accident			2
it claims that even though small cars like the @entity3 can score well in crash tests , the sheer size of bigger vehicles will ultimately better protect passengers from injuries			1
drive safely : the @entity3 500 , pictured in a crash test carried out by the @entity20 , has the highest rates for @entity7 motor insurance policies which cover crash injuries to passengers an @entity24 : but an expert from the organisation nevertheless warned drivers to avoid the smallest cars if passenger safety is their priority , since bigger vehicles offer more protection ' if safety is a priority , you should avoid the smallest cars , ' said @entity35 , spokesman for the @entity20 ( @entity20 )			1
' the laws of physics are always in play in crashes			0
' smaller , lighter cars are safer than they used to be , but all things being equal , people riding in bigger , heavier vehicles get more protection in crashes			0
' in a head - on crash , the vehicle that is heavier will drive the lighter one backward , increasing crash forces for the people in the lighter car and reducing forces for those in the heavier one , said mr @entity35			0
he added : ' smaller cars also have less crush space in front to manage the energy of a crash and help " cushion " the occupants as the vehicle comes to a stop			0
' safest choice : the @entity65 1500 during a crash test			1
in a head - on crash , heavier vehicles drive lighters one back , increasing forces for the people in the lighter car and reducing forces for those in the heavier one the research by @entity76 , a @entity7 insurance price comparison website , analysed rates for @entity79 ( @entity79 ) and @entity80 ( @entity81 ) policies , which cover payouts to injured passengers			1
using insurance rates for more than 750 vehicles in our annual car insurance comparison study , the study picked out the vehicles with the lowest and highest costs for @entity79 and @entity81 coverage			2
the @entity93 has good crash test ratings and it is an @entity24 , but these insurance costs , based on the amounts of claims made , should reflect the real - world safety of the vehicle			2
the way they are driven also effects the figures , however			0
@entity103 of the list of safest vehicles was the @entity7 - made @entity65 1500 pick - up truck			1
vehicles from the @entity108 truck marque filled four spots in the list of the top five safest			0
' @entity113 design proves to be no match for @entity7 brawn when it comes to passenger safety , ' the research noted .			0

@entity113 - designed car has highest rate for passenger injury insurance
it scores well in crash tests , but loses out to bigger vehicles in real life
@entity65 1500 pick - up truck named safest for passengers
