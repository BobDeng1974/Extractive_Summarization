@entity0 are getting older , but not this old : @entity2 records show that 6.5 million people in the @entity0 have reached the ripe old age of 112			1
in reality , only few could possibly be alive			0
as of last fall , there were only 42 people known to be that old in the entire world			0
but @entity2 does not have death records for millions of these people , with the oldest born in 1869 , according to a report by the agency 's inspector general			1
only 13 of the people are still getting @entity2 benefits , the report said			1
but for others , their @entity2 numbers are still active , so a number could be used to report wages , open bank accounts , obtain credit cards or claim fraudulent tax refunds			1
' that is a real problem , ' said sen. @entity27 , @entity28 ripe old age : social security has not updated the deaths of 6.5 million people , new data has shown , meaning all those social security numbers remain active			1
seen here is @entity36 on her 116th birthday last year			0
she is the oldest known person in the @entity0 ' when you have a fake @entity2 number , that 's what allows you to fraudulently do all kinds things , claim things like the earned income tax credit or other tax benefits			1
' @entity27 is chairman of the @entity46 , which plans a hearing monday on problems with death records maintained by the @entity51			1
the agency said it is working to improve the accuracy of its death records			1
but it would be costly and time - consuming to update 6.5 million files that were generated decades ago , when the agency used paper records , said @entity59 , a senior adviser to the agency 's deputy commissioner for budget , finance , quality and management			1
' the records in this review are extremely old , decades - old , and unreliable , ' @entity59 said			0
the internal watchdog 's report does not document any fraudulent or improper payments to people using these @entity2 numbers			1
but it raises red flags that it could be happening			0
for example , nearly 67,000 of the @entity2 numbers were used to report more than $ 3 billion in wages , tips and self - employment income from 2006 to 2011 , according to the report			1
one social security number was used 613 different times			2
an additional 194 numbers were used at least 50 times each			0
people in the country illegally often use fake or stolen @entity2 numbers to get jobs and report wages , as do other people who do not want to be found by the government			1
thieves use stolen @entity2 numbers to claim fraudulent tax refunds			1
the @entity94 estimated it paid out $ 5.8 billion in fraudulent tax refunds in 2013 because of identity theft			1
the head of the @entity98 's tax division described how it 's done at a recent congressional hearing			0
problem : @entity2 does not have death records for millions of people with birth dates stretching back as far as 1869			1
seen here is president @entity106 signing the @entity2 bill on august 13 , 1935 ' the plan is frighteningly simple â€” steal @entity2 numbers , file tax returns showing a false refund claim , and then have the refunds electronically deposited or sent to an address where the offender can access the refund checks , ' said acting assistant attorney general @entity116			1
in some cases , she said , false tax returns are filed using @entity2 numbers of deceased taxpayers or others who are not required to file			2
the @entity51 generates a list of dead people to help public agencies and private companies know when @entity2 numbers are no longer valid for use			2
the list is called the @entity128 , which includes the name , @entity2 number , date of birth and date of death for people who have died			2
the list is widely used by employers , financial firms , credit reporting agencies and security firms			2
federal agencies and state and local governments rely on it to police benefit payments			0
but none of the 6.5 million people cited by the inspector general 's report was on the list			1
the audit analyzed records as of 2013 , looking for people with birth dates before 1901			2
president @entity106 signed the @entity2 in 1935 , and the first old - age monthly benefit check was paid in 1940			0
many of the people cited in the inspector general 's report never received benefits , though they were assigned @entity2 numbers so spouses and children could receive them , presumably after they died			2
the agency says it has corrected death information in more than 200,000 records			2
but fixing the entire list would be costly and time - consuming because @entity2 needs proof that a person is dead to add them to the death list , said @entity59 , the agency official			0
@entity59 noted that the inspector general 's report did not verify that any of the 6.5 million people are actually dead			1
instead , the report assumed they are dead because of their advanced age			0
' we ca n't post information to our records based on presumption , ' @entity59 said			0
' we post information to our records based on evidence , and in this case it would be evidence of a death certificate			2
' ' some of those records may not even exist , ' @entity59 added			0
nearly all the @entity2 numbers are from paper records generated before the agency started using electronic records in 1972 , @entity59 said			0
many of the records contain errors , with multiple birthdates and bits of information about different family members			0
' we did transcribe paper records into the electronic system and over time that information 's been purified , ' @entity59 said			0
' but our focus right now is to make sure our data is as accurate and complete as it can be for our current program purpose , ' said @entity59			0
' right now , we 're focused on making sure we 're paying beneficiaries properly , and that 's how we 're investing our resources at this time			0

social security has not updated the death records of 6.5 million people
only 13 of those millions of people are actually getting benefits
the other active numbers could be used to report wages , open bank accounts , obtain credit cards or claim fraudulent tax refunds
allows a huge *vulnerability* for fraud , said sen. @entity27 said
the @entity94 estimated it paid out $ 5.8 billion in fraudulent tax refunds in 2013 *due* to identity theft
