this is despite the fact they do n't have to worry about bombs , blackouts and rationing , says psychologist @entity12			1
he adds that today ’s adults spend twice as much time fretting about their lives as those who lived through the @entity4			1
@entity2 adults today are self - obsessed and ' consumed ' with negative thoughts about their own personal problems from work and money to relationships , a psychologist has claimed the book , @entity23 , also claims that @entity24 have forgotten how to ' look on the bright side of life '			1

the problem is that today 's adults are ' consumed ' with negative thoughts about their own personal problems from work and money to relationships , he believes			1
in contrast , during the war there was a more positive attitude because it helped people to deal with what were much more serious problems all around them , said mr @entity12			2
psychologist @entity12 claims we now worry more about our daily lives than those who lived through @entity4 ( pictured in @entity48 ) - and are also more stressed and likely to have anxiety problems his book , described as ‘ a handbook for personal development ’ , is based on his analysis of several hundred patients he has treated for stress or anxiety related issues			1

‘ yet records show they were able to keep things in perspective , which often meant looking on the bright side - even at the most difficult of times			1
‘ resilience was then a cornerstone of the @entity2 character			0
‘ @entity24 , on the other hand , are consumed with anxiety , most of which is brought on by non-life - threatening issues like employment , finance and relationships			0
‘ compared to the war , we 've never had it so good - but based on anxiety levels you would n't know it			0
’ stress is now the most common reason for absence from work and has also been linked with increased rates of associated illnesses from dementia to high blood pressure , he said			0
the positive attitudes of wartime @entity24 has led to mr @entity12 drawing up a stress - busting programme called @entity106			2
it encourages the churchillian ' indomitable spirit ' of the @entity29 in dealing with problems and how to develop a positive attitude			0
mr @entity12 said : ‘ maintaining a realistic , positive attitude to the problems that come our way got @entity2 through its darkest days			2
‘ @entity114 was the perfect embodiment of this			0
