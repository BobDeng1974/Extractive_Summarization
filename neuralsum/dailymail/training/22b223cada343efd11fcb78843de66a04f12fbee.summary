@entity1 's authorities have been warned that they risk creating a culture of diving in the game , due to the way that acts of foul play are being refereed			0
last month , this column highlighted the spectre of ‘ simulation ’ – as it has become known in football – taking hold as players seek to con officials into awarding penalties and dishing out cards			0
now , that threat has been reinforced by @entity18 ’s director of rugby , @entity17 , in light of a contentious incident last saturday			1
@entity22 's @entity21 ( left ) escaped a citing last weekend because of @entity24 's lack of reaction the @entity18 were incensed when no action was taken against @entity21 of @entity22 for punching their flanker , @entity24 , in the face at @entity29			1
@entity24 was on the receiving end from @entity31 when @entity18 faced @entity22 having sought clarification , @entity17 was stunned to be informed by the @entity33 that referee @entity34 was entitled to down - play the offence on the basis that the victim did not appear to be hurt			1
in return , he expressed concerns that this out - look will lead to the spread of diving			0
‘ in law , i am told that a punch is down to the referee ’s interpretation , so the referee will decide whether it is a hard or a soft punch , ’ said @entity17			1
‘ the referee and the @entity50 at the weekend decided that the punch to @entity24 ’s face did n’t hurt him and was n’t hard			1
‘ i had an email from @entity54 ( @entity33 disciplinary officer ) and @entity56 ( citing officer ) who said it was n’t even a level - one citing , which is when it should have been a yellow card			0
one of the comments that alarmed me the most is that @entity24 did n’t need treatment and did n’t go to the floor			2
‘ well , it did n’t really hurt @entity24 so it is alright			1
how do you know it has not cracked his cheekbone or his jaw ? the 50 year - old bloke sat in the @entity50 caravan outside is dictating whether someone gets hurt when they get punched			1
‘ the encouragement would be that if you get punched then go to the floor , get treatment and the player will get sent off			2
so now the law - makers are actually encouraging you to dive and i said that is the thin end of the wedge			1
’ the @entity33 have re-affirmed their conviction that this particular case was handled correctly – with the citing commissioner concluding that a penalty was sufficient for a weak punch which made minimal contact and did not provoke any response from @entity24			1
the union have also noted that @entity18 did not make an official complaint about the matter and the governing body reject the notion that this sort of episode will provoke increasing levels of play - acting			0
@entity17 fears that the laws could leave to the type of diving seen in football , shown here by @entity105 however , asked if he feared that this officiating issue would lead to coaches instructing their players to engage in simulation , @entity17 added : ‘ you would n’t , but it is getting to that point			2
’ this policy towards the appraisal of foul play must be amended urgently			0
@entity17 ’s point is valid , as diving is a minor , occasional problem for now , but this situation could lead to it becoming a real blight on the game			2
the notion that a full - blooded punch to the face that causes no immediate , obvious damage is more acceptable than a glancing blow that happens to draw blood is absurd			2
the game is in an officiating hole due to guidelines issued to referees which remove the common - sense element of discretion , especially when it comes to the safety - first minefield of dangerous tackles			2
but in this case , the discretionary powers appear mis - placed			0
it would be disastrous for rugby if taking a tumble and feigning an injury was the only guaranteed route to justice			0
last weekend , @entity146 was congratulated on reaching the @entity148 @entity147 by his perennial @entity150 adversary , @entity149 , who said : ‘ see you on the dark side ’ – in reference to their mutual code switch			1
@entity149 has played union before and will slot straight back into the @entity157 set - up , whereas @entity146 is preparing for an accelerated education in the 15 - man game as he targets a @entity162 call - up by @entity163			1
@entity149 will go straight back into the @entity157 side as he moves back to @entity165 for the @entity162 @entity146 , tackled by three men , is also making the switch to @entity165 in time for the @entity168 he may wish to make the transition under the radar but there is no chance of that			2
@entity174 have released the first in a series of promotional trailers , entitled ‘ @entity178 ’ as they prepare to welcome the league icon later this month			2
with the backdrop of a @entity184 arena and a heart - beat soundtrack , it shows @entity146 in explosive action and heralds his credentials ; both his physical stature and his sensational recent match stats			1
he is depicted as an unstoppable force of nature and his new club will hope that they soon have similar footage of @entity146 scattering opponents in their colours			2
the transition will be televised			0
while they await their high - profile new recruit , @entity174 have more pressing business on friday night as they face @entity201 in an intriguing @entity203 encounter at the @entity204 both clubs are among the early front - runners in the league and destined to feature in the title tussle next may			1
both have recently ‘ nilled ’ leading rivals in stunning fashion – @entity174 beating @entity18 45 - 0 and @entity201 ’ winning 39 - 0 away to @entity212			1
there is unlikely to be a solitary zero on the scoreboard by the end of this match			0
saracens have made a superb start to the season but will be in for a tough test against high - flying @entity174 @entity174 have promoted @entity221 to start at full back and @entity163 wing @entity223 is poised to make an injury comeback from the bench			1
@entity201 must operate their fabled ‘ wolf - pack ’ defence without the influential presence of @entity230 , who has a minor calf injury , while @entity232 is also absent again			0
this column – without overwhelming conviction – predicts a narrow @entity174 win			2
while @entity149 and @entity146 prepare for life in union , maverick @entity148 back @entity236 may be on his way to league after the latest in a sequence of personal controversies			1
having had his run - ins with the authorities several times before and struggled with alcohol - related issues , the gifted @entity244 play - maker has been dropped by the @entity246 for tomorrow ’s @entity248 clash with @entity249			0
@entity236 is alleged to have fallen out with a member of the @entity148 staff after playing @entity256 this follows allegations of a heated row with a team official on a flight from @entity256 to @entity262 – an incident that has been referred to @entity148 ’s ‘ integrity unit ’ and has side - tracked head coach @entity265 from the primary task of preparing his side to face the @entity268			1
the up - shots are that @entity249 have surely their best chance yet of securing a maiden tournament win and @entity236 ’s future is in jeopardy			1
it would be a shame if the game were to lose such a precocious talent , but the benefit of the doubt can only be applied so many times … @entity236 is a fantastic talent but he has already been given the benefit of the doubt several times @entity163 ’s coaches were awarded new contracts through to 2020 , just days after @entity285 left the @entity287 - based @entity286 – reportedly with a view to being available if a @entity290 job comes up after the @entity162			1
the @entity256 who guided his country to global glory in 2007 has been interested in coaching @entity163 before			0
the role has great cachet and if @entity297 ’s team collapsed in a heap next year ( highly unlikely ) , the @entity33 would need to assess whether there were viable alternatives before dispensing with the current coaches , at great expense			0
@entity303 and his assistants have been given new long - term contracts ahead of the @entity162 these days , every union is expected to conduct a ‘ worldwide search ’ for the right man , amid a perception that there are always various stellar options overseas			0
in truth , @entity285 is one of very few , but his gold - plated cv does n’t boast a forensic knowledge of @entity317 rugby			0
his compatriot , @entity318 , has surely been away from the game ’s front line for too long to be a contender again			0
@entity150 coaches are an export trade in their own right , but it is unlikely the @entity33 would try to poach @entity326 from @entity327 or @entity328 from @entity329			0
the grass is not necessarily greener elsewhere			0
@entity162 winner @entity285 left the @entity286 in the hope that he could take over a @entity290 side after 2015			0

referees and @entity335 deciding on severity of a punch by player 's reaction
@entity24 was punched by @entity22 's @entity21 last weekend
no action was taken because @entity24 did not seem hurt
@entity17 says ' the law - makers are actually encouraging you to dive ' and calls it ' the thin end of the wedge '
@entity146 given a big *introduction* by @entity174 ahead of his codes change
@entity236 could move the other way towards @entity354
