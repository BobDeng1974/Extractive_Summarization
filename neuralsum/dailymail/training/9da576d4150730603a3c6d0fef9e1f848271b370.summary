by @entity0 @entity1 has refuted @entity3 ’s claims that she ‘ could n’t find anybody ’ to make a dress for her to wear to the 2012 @entity6			1
the @entity8 - based fashion designer - who won the fourth season of @entity10 in 2007 - told the @entity11 that he ‘ met with her people ’ and attempted to collaborate with ms @entity3 , 43 , on an @entity6 gown			1
‘ quite frankly she was quite difficult to work with , ’ mr @entity1 said of actress , who had been nominated as best supporting actress for her role in bridesmaids			2
and she was not comfortable with them in the end			0
’ ms @entity3 ended up wearing a pale pink dress by @entity23 for the event instead – a choice that won her mixed reviews from fashion pundits			1
mr @entity1 ’s comments follow those made by ms @entity3 in the june issue of @entity44 in which she said : ‘ two oscars ago , i could n’t find anybody to do a dress for me			1
i asked five or six designers – very high - level ones who make lots of dresses for people – and they all said no. ’ recent looks : ms @entity3 wore a leather dress to the @entity49 premiere of her new film @entity51 last week ( left ) and a sequined cardigan and jumpsuit by an unknown designer to the film 's @entity8 premiere on june 26 ( right ) since then , though , it seems she has won over the fashion set			1
just last week , she won praise for her appearance at the @entity55 in @entity49 for which she wore a leather - and - chiffon dress with leopard print @entity63 heels			2
on june 26 she wore a sequined cardigan over a black silk jumpsuit to the film 's @entity8 premiere			0

in the interview the mother - of - two , married to @entity71 since 2005 , also alluded to the possibility of her creating a plus - size fashion label			0
‘ when i go shopping , most of the time i ’m disappointed , ’ she said			2
providing criticism : mr @entity1 first rose to fame in 2007 as the winner of the fourth season of @entity10 ( pictured ) the venture would represent her longstanding interest in fashion			2
as a teenager , she had aspirations of attending @entity8 ’s @entity87 – a dream that her parents ultimately refused in favor of a more academic education			0
their efforts appear to have been in vain though			0
she briefly attended the @entity95 before dropping out to move to @entity8 and try her luck at a stand - up comedy career			0
ms @entity3 was also friends with the now - famous footwear designer @entity99 and the pair remain close today .			1

the 2007 @entity10 winner , who attempted to collaborate with ms @entity3 in 2012 , claims that the actress ‘ wanted some specific things that i thought would not look good on her body ’
ms @entity3 last month claimed that ‘ two @entity6 ago , i could n’t find anybody to do a dress for me ’
