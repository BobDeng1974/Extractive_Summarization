a publicity stunt that involved releasing thousands of butterflies at a @entity3 science exhibition to raise awareness of conservation backfired badly - after thousands of the insects were killed			1
the incident took place in @entity9 in central @entity3 's @entity10 during the @entity11 , organised by a museum in the city			1
during the event more than 10,000 rare butterfly specimens of various species from around the world were on display			0
poorly thought - out : thousands of butterflies were killed during a conservation event in @entity21 , @entity3			1
the insects were released but many injured by crowds eager to hold them ironic : the aim of the butterfly release was to highlight conservation efforts shredded : this picture shows the badly - damaged remains of the butterflies the organisers also released thousands of butterflies to promote the idea of environmental awareness			1
but , instead of protecting them , visitors started to fight to capture the flying butterflies , causing many of the creatures to be crushed or injured			2
amazingly , something similar happened during an event to showcase the natural beauty of land earmarked for a new property development earlier this month			0
a company bought land on the outskirts of the city of @entity48 in @entity3 's @entity49 and hoped to attract potential buyers by highlighting the area 's natural environment , far away from the smog of the city			2
the region of rolling hills and woodland is named @entity58 , and so the developers decided that a @entity60 would be the perfect way to showcase the region			0
visitors started to fight to capture the flying butterflies , causing many of the creatures to be crushed or injured the incident took place in @entity9 in central @entity3 's @entity10 during the @entity11 , organised by a museum in the city @entity69 expired : a woman holds a pair of the fragile insects up to the camera children grabbed the brightly - coloured butterflies			1
they event featured a vast array of different species a butterfly lands on the arm of a toddler attending the science exhibition the only problem was most butterflies hatched in the area in early spring and the last ones had already died around june			1
so instead they contacted specialist breeders and arranged for thousands of butterflies from more than 800 different species to be shipped in			2
some were released by members of the public , while others were kept in special netted tents for the amusement of visitors			0
however , not only did many of the butterflies get injured in transit and die shortly after they were released , but others succumbed to the unseasonal weather and expired after a few days			2
so instead of the sight of butterflies fluttering over the valley or being snapped by happy visitors , @entity3 social media was flooded with images of dead and dying exotic butterflies falling from the sky or being trampled underfoot			0
it sparked a wave of protest from @entity3 's small but increasingly vocal animal rights activists who said the whole idea was ' cruel and pointless '			0
the pr agency that organised the stunt said they had asked visitors not to touch or play with the butterflies , and that the only reason they were dying was because they had a short lifespan .			0

the insects were released at a science show in the city of @entity9
aim was to increase awareness of conservation efforts to protect butterflies
but the crowd tried to grab them as they flew away , killing thousands
