he famously renounced his hereditary title so he could remain an mp			1
but 50 years after @entity3 relinquished the @entity4 of @entity5 , his son has reclaimed the title so he can take a seat in the @entity9			1
the maverick socialist ’s eldest son , @entity10 , will become the latest of @entity13 ’s ‘ red princes ’ to enter @entity14 if he successfully contests a hereditary by - election next month			1
@entity17 ( right ) has applied to reclaim the @entity4 which his father @entity18 ( left ) gave up in the 1960s to continue his career as an mp			1
they are pictured with @entity10 's daughter @entity22 in 2007			0
@entity3 died in march this year the 63 - year - old former @entity13 official , whose younger brother @entity25 is shadow communities secretary in the @entity26 , is thought to be keen to take up a role on the opposition benches in the @entity29			1
@entity3 , who died aged 88 in march , fought to change the law so he could become the first peer to renounce his title			1
after inheriting the title @entity5 on the death of his father in 1960 , mr @entity3 , who was already an mp , was disbarred from the @entity36			1
he successfully campaigned for the law to be amended , allowing him to renounce his title and retake his @entity39 seat in 1963			2
at the time , he said : ' i am not a reluctant peer but a persistent commoner			0
' his son @entity10 , a lobbyist for the @entity44 , who will now be known as the 3rd @entity5 , was today accepted on the @entity46			1
the majority of the hereditary peers are not allowed to sit in the lords owing to the @entity50 that capped their numbers			0
but when one of the 90 to still retain a seat dies , the other peers of the deceased ’s political party then vote for their new candidate in a by - election			0
there are currently two vacancies following the death of @entity62 of @entity63 and the retirement of @entity65 last month			0
both peers were crossbenchers , so if @entity68 stands in the by - election to replace them next month , he will be elected onto the crossbenches , but will then be able to move to @entity13 ’s opposition bench			2
last month it emerged that not a single penny of @entity3 ’s £ 5m estate went to the @entity13 , the poor , or any radical causes he supported in his will			1
instead , mr @entity3 , who throughout his political career was contemptuous of elitism and the privilege of inherited wealth , left almost his entire fortune to his four children			1
his eight - bedroom ancestral home , understood to be worth millions , had been left in a trust for his family , which is thought to have avoided them having to pay inheritance tax on it			0
family affair : a @entity3 family portrait taken in april 1961 , as @entity18 battled to keep his seat in the @entity26 after being disqualified for holding a peerage			2
he was pictured at his @entity96 home with his wife , @entity98 , and four children ( left - right ) : @entity25 , 7 , @entity100 , 2 , @entity101 , 4 , and @entity10 , 9 , who has now sought to reclaim the hereditary title while his brother @entity17 is currently seeking a route into the @entity9 , @entity103 has already carved out a long political career			1
now shadow communities secretary , he served in the @entity109 and @entity110 governments after being elected mp for @entity112 in 1999 – a position he has held for 15 years			0
since being elected , he has also served as secretary of state for international development ( from 2003 to 2007 ) and as the secretary of state for environment , food and rural affairs ( from 2007 to 2010 )			0
however , @entity25 is not the only @entity3 to have been a successful mp – his father @entity18 was an mp for nearly 50 years , serving in the @entity117 and @entity118 in the 1960s and 1970s			1
@entity18 stood for @entity39 between 1950 and 2001 but was forced to stand down when he inherited a hereditary peerage on his father @entity122 ’s death			2
air commodore @entity122 was elected as a @entity124 and @entity13 mp several times between 1906 and 1942 and was also secretary of state for india ( from 1929 to 1931 ) and secretary of state for air ( from 1945 and 194 )			1
in 1942 , he was raised to the peerage as @entity5 , of @entity129 in @entity130			0
at the time , the wartime coalition government was short of working @entity13 peers in the upper house			2
upon his death in november 1960 , his son @entity18 inherited the peerage , becoming the 2nd @entity5			0
the peerage prevented him from continuing as mp for @entity39 but he fought to remain in the @entity36 before campaigning for the ability to renounce the title			0
@entity18 was the first peer to make use of the @entity50 , which was given @entity142 in july 1963			0
as well as @entity122 , @entity18 and @entity25 , the @entity143 have long been members of @entity14			0
@entity10 and @entity25 ’s great - grandfather , sir @entity145 , was a @entity124 mp from 1892 - 95 and 1904 - 10 and , another great - grandfather , @entity146 , was a national liberal mp from 1911 - 18			1
recently , @entity10 ’s 25 - year - old daughter @entity22 became a @entity13 councillor in @entity149			1
she was elected to the @entity151 ward of @entity152 and is standing to become mp in @entity154 in 2015			0
born @entity3 , @entity3 became @entity156 's youngest mp when he was elected in 1950 aged 25			1
his father @entity122 had been raised to become the 1st @entity158 under @entity159 and become secretary of state for air under @entity161			0
when his older brother was killed on active service in @entity164 , @entity3 became the heir to the viscountcy			1
lord @entity3 ’s daughter @entity22 , 25 , has already earned herself a mocking royal title – @entity169 – as she threatens to become the fifth generation of the family to enter @entity14			2
she is standing for @entity13 in @entity154 next year			2
like her fellow youthful @entity13 parliamentary hopefuls the ‘ @entity178 ’ @entity173 , son of @entity175 , and @entity176 , son of former home secretary @entity177 , she is believed by some to have been able to launch her political career thanks to her ancestry , rather than her ability			2
already a @entity149 councillor , and holding the record of being the youngest every parliamentary candidate when she was just 17 , she denies any nepotism , but has boasted : ‘ i was born during the @entity13 conference in 1989			0
my birth was announced to the floor			0
' @entity189 , @entity190 at the @entity191 , which maintains official registers of coats of arms and pedigrees , said lord @entity3 had been entered onto the @entity46 after proving his right to succession			1
he said : ‘ @entity3 ’s elder brother was killed in the war and @entity3 did not want to accept the peerage because he wanted to continue to sit in the @entity36			2
‘ until the hereditary peers as a body were abolished you could not sit in the @entity36 if you had a title			0
‘ so @entity3 brought in this bill to renounce peerages but it was framed such that it was renounced by whoever but not for their successors			0
‘ his younger son @entity25 is an mp but the elder son is not , he presumably wishes to go to the @entity9 to participate in politics as an hereditary peer if he is elected			1
’ lord @entity3 did not respond to requests to comment .			0
