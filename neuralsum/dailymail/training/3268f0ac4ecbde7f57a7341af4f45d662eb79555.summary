other tricks in her repertoire include kung fu moves , putting rubbish in the bin , making a bed and loading the dishwasher			2
the pair have been together since @entity5 was born in june 2011 and from a young age started her training ' you would n't believe what @entity5 can do , she 's amazing , ' said the owner from @entity45			0
' from fetching me things , to helping me undress and emptying the washing machine			2
i 'd be lost without her			0
' ' @entity5 is already a @entity64 and she loves doing her tricks so i thought , why not do a trick a day for a year ?

' she plays dead , does the meerkat where she stands on her back legs , and does a handstand on her front legs , all sorts of things			0
' the owner , who has trained to become a @entity100 , hopes @entity5 's extraordinary skills will raise £ 1,000 for @entity49 , a charity that provides training to pet dog owners so they can turn their beloved pooch into a qualified @entity107			0
