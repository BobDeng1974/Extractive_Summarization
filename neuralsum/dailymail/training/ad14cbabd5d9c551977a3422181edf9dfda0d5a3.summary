a railway passenger was left stunned after she needed a staggering 14 tickets just for a simple return train trip			0
project manager @entity3 , 28 , booked the easy journey from @entity5 to @entity7 online , only to be bamboozled by a huge pile of paperwork			1
when she arrived at the station she was shocked and confused when the machine spewed out 14 separate tickets for the £ 16.50 trip - plus a receipt			2
confused : @entity3 and her bike needed more than a dozen separate tickets just to travel 200 miles by train barmy : @entity3 holds the wad of 14 tickets - which cost her £ 16.50 - and a receipt that flowed endlessly out of the machine the pile included two tickets for herself , four seat reservations , four tickets for her bike as well as four further bike reservations			1
this stack of tickets was needed to cover @entity3 changing trains at @entity33 and for her return journey home			1
ms @entity3 has said the amount of tickets was ' confusing ' as she did not know which one to show at the barrier or show the guard on board the train			1
and now the @entity42 say they are looking at reducing the amount of tickets passengers need as a result			0
the 28 - year - old , from @entity5 , @entity47 , said : ' when i was at the machine the tickets would just not stop coming out			1
odd : the passenger , 28 , only needed to travel from @entity5 station , pictured above , to @entity7 station , below , but it was complicated by a mammoth pile of paperwork ' at first i thought there was something wrong because there were 15 bits of card			2
' there were ticket reservations for me , ticket reservations for my bike , and because we changed trains and it was a return trip there more and more tickets			2
' 2x passenger tickets 4x seat reservations 4x cycle tickets 4x cycle reservations total = 14 tickets she added : ' it ’s confusing because with 14 tickets i was n’t sure which one i needed for the automatic barrier			1
' when the guard came on board to check my ticket he had to go through them all and help me give him the correct one			0
' i think it ’s also really wasteful , especially at a time when people are becoming more conscious of the environment			0
' i do n’t see why we ca n’t have an oyster card like in @entity95 or a bit of paper with a barcode on it			0
' fourteen - ticket journey : return trip from @entity5 to @entity7 and back was 200 miles a spokesperson for the @entity104 said : ' train companies have been involved for some time now in a series of projects to improve the information they provide to passengers including a redesign of tickets to make them easier to understand			2
' a lot has been done to make things as straightforward as possible for passengers and we are committed to doing better			0
' too much : the machine continued to spew tickets and now train operators are looking to reduce the number needed to travel			0

@entity3 had two tickets for herself plus four seat reservations and eight other tickets for her bike
the 28 - year - old *'s* experience *prompted* a *review* by rail *bosses* who admitted the paperwork was ' *excessive* '
