the mother of a 17 - year - old girl who was shot and killed by @entity3 police earlier this week is calling for an independent autopsy because she does n't trust the official investigation @entity6 made the demand after her daughter @entity8 was shot on monday - the fourth time in seven months a @entity10 officer fired at a vehicle after perceiving it as a threat			1
the request came yesterday as the @entity15 and an independent city official who monitors the agency disclosed that separate investigations were underway into policies regarding officers shooting at moving vehicles			2
' ' i want to know , how did this happen ? i want to know everything			0
' she also has five other children , including a four - year - old son , to worry about			0
police have said the two officers involved in the shooting , @entity48 , a 16 - year - veteran , and @entity50 , a nine - year - veteran of the force , fired after @entity52 drove a stolen car into one of them			1
@entity50 suffered a fractured leg			0
a passenger in the car disputed that account , saying police opened fire before the vehicle struck the officer			1
police have admitted no one in the car , which contained five people , was armed			0
@entity48 and @entity50 have been placed on routine administrative leave pending the investigation			2
@entity52 's mother said her daughter made a mistake by ' grabbing ' a car that did not belong to her but did n't deserve to pay with her life			0
she said : ' how much do they need to investigate ? ' ' it 's all done			0
all i want is justice			0
' a passenger in the car , who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of safety concerns , said @entity52 lost control of the vehicle because she was unconscious after being shot			2
the passenger said officers came up to the car from behind and fired four times into the driver 's side window as they stood on the side of the car , narrowly missing others inside			1
mrs @entity6 criticized the way police handled her daughter after she was shot			1
she said : ' they dragged her on the floor and threw her down like a piece of garbage , ' mrs @entity6 held her four - year - old son @entity98 while she talked with reporters in her home in @entity101 a shrine in remembrance of @entity8 's life was set up at her family 's home			1
she leaves behind five siblings a passenger in the car said @entity8 ( pictured left and right ) lost control of the vehicle after being shot the shooting occurred amid a national debate about police use of force fueled by racially - charged episodes in @entity117 , @entity118 , and @entity119			1
investigators in the @entity10 case will be relying on witnesses and police accounts because the department has only just started to buy body cameras for its officers and @entity50 and @entity48 were not yet outfitted			1
@entity10 does not use in - car dashboard cameras			2
prosecutors promised a thorough probe of the shooting as a group of angry protesters demanded swift answers and called for a special prosecutor to investigate the death earlier this week			2
a vigil in the alleyway in which the teenager was shot dead was also held			1
protester @entity141 waves a sign before a meeting with officials from the @entity146 's office @entity149 ( center ) and @entity151 ( right ) , senior chief deputy district attorneys with the office of the @entity146 , talked to @entity152 ( left ) and other activists on tuesday the @entity155 @entity154 has held that officers may not use deadly force to stop a fleeing suspect unless the person is believed to pose significant physical harm			2
policies vary and some departments have banned or discouraged the practice			0
the police department and independent monitor @entity164 are both looking at how national standards compare to @entity10 's policy			1
the city currently allows officers to fire at moving cars if they have no other reasonable way to prevent death or serious injury			0
@entity10 's policy urges officers to try to move out of the way rather than fire			1
it states : ' an officer threatened by an oncoming vehicle shall , if feasible , move out of the way rather than discharging a firearm			0
' experts say shooting and disabling a driver can send a car out of control			0
@entity186 , executive director of the @entity187 , said : ' if you were to shoot at the driver you would have an unguided missile , basically			0
' candles and bouquets were left near the scene of the fatal police shooting in an alleyway in northeast @entity10 flowers were put out , candles were lit and a rosary was draped over a portrait of @entity8 at her home			1
