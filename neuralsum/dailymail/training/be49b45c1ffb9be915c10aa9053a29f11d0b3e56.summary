by @entity0 @entity1 asked @entity4 blog @entity2 about the club 's stuttering start under @entity7			1
the @entity9 outfit were unbeaten throughout pre-season but lost their opening @entity13 match 2 - 1 at home to @entity15			1
this was followed by a 1 - 1 draw at @entity18 on sunday before suffering an emphatic 4 - 0 defeat at @entity21 side @entity22 in the second round of the @entity24			1
@entity2 ' @entity25 gives his insight as to what 's wrong at the @entity28			0
@entity4 have struggled to start the new season like they would have imagined after an impressive tour of the @entity31			1
the pre-season tour saw victories over @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity37 but the new season has popped up with defeats against @entity15 and @entity22			2
@entity7 is the only one that can explain what has changed in a matter of weeks , but when the 3 - 5 - 2 formation was introduced to the current @entity4 squad in @entity45 , they put seven past @entity47 's former club @entity46			1
throughout the tour , @entity4 played with a high intensity , attacked quickly in numbers and moved the ball exceptionally well			0
food for thought : @entity4 boss @entity7 has had a poor start in his new job winning smile : @entity57 ( left ) and @entity58 ( right ) lift the @entity59 thumped : @entity28 were thrashed 4 - 0 by @entity22 in the @entity24 second round on tuesday night @entity61 blames injuries , errors and luck then , once returned in @entity65 , a friendly against @entity67 was organised on request of @entity7			1
while they won thanks to a last minute winner by @entity71 , @entity4 performed poorly and the @entity73 side looked a much more comfortable unit			1
there was undoubtedly great excitement ahead of the new season under a manager full of experience at the top level			0
@entity61 was also coming in with a change of philosophy and a similar aura to sir @entity84			0
serial winner : sir @entity84 enjoyed a trophy - laden spell whilst in charge at @entity9 back in july , @entity61 warned fans that it would take him three months to fix @entity4 and get them into shape			1
' every club where i have been , i 've struggled for the first three months , ' said @entity61 , speaking in @entity94 ' when we survive the first three months , it will be the same as for me as it was at @entity97			2
at @entity97 , after the first three months , we were sixth or seventh and we were third in our @entity99 group			0
' slow starter : @entity61 admitted his reign at @entity97 started poorly in his first three months there too bereft of ideas : @entity105 was sacked as @entity4 boss in april with the club languishing in seventh i trust @entity61 more than i ever did under the management of @entity105			1
he is a proven winner that even has a nack for overachieving with average players			1
when you look at the @entity117 national team from the @entity118 , it was hardly a side full of world beaters aside from one or two			2
at @entity4 right now there are lots of deadwood and players that are struggling with confidence since @entity105 ' reign			2
in terms of giving @entity61 time , he needs it more than ever			2
it can easily be argued that taking over from @entity105 has been more difficult than taking over from @entity84			0
the squad has withdrawn its bite and it 's an even bigger ask to expect it back in one season			0
meanwhile , the new system requires specific types of players in each position			0
the back three does seem an issue but that was always going to be the case when you lose players like @entity146 , @entity147 and @entity148			0
thus far , two defenders have been brought in but @entity4 's defensive crop of selections lack that experience that proves vital in tough times like these			0
big miss : @entity4 have failed to replace defenders @entity146 ( left ) and @entity147 ( right ) top talent : summer signing @entity157 looks like a fantastic addition to @entity4 's midfield in midfield we remain light			2
@entity157 has looked fantastic but is nowhere near the finished article			0
a signing such as @entity165 or @entity166 would accommodate him superbly and might even allow @entity7 to play his preferred formation : 4 - 3 - 3			1
and while these reasons go a long way to explaining why it was always going to be a difficult to start to life under @entity7 , i doubt many fans expected struggle of this magnitude			2
all football clubs go through transitions but that 's not an excuse for losing games			0
@entity4 need a big win to give @entity61 's players a boost			1
on the move : @entity186 midfielder @entity165 ( right ) has been linked with a move to @entity4 this summer			0

@entity4 have made a poor start under new boss @entity7
@entity4 have failed to win a @entity13 game and were thumped 4 - 0 in the @entity24 second round to @entity22
@entity61 has always started slowly at a new club and just needs time
@entity117 is a proven winner and with a few more signings he can mould the club into his own image bringing back confidence to the side
united travel to @entity184 on *saturday* in their @entity13 encounter
