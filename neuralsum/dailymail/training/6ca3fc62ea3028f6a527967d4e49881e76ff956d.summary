any mother would stick their neck out to defend a child			1
but this giraffe goes beyond the call of duty for her calf , taking on an entire pride of lions - and winning			1
the tall creature , filmed at the @entity11 in the @entity13 reserve , @entity14 , was caught on camera as the ravenous predators saunter towards it			1
when the beasts , moving as one , start to bolt towards her , she fends them all off by aggressively waving her long legs towards them			2
a tense stalemate follows , after which the lions remember that discretion is the better part of valour and move on			2
the encounter was captured by tourists @entity48 and @entity50 on a visit to the @entity52			0
get back ! the giraffe sends the lions into a panic after lunging forward with its legs the patient hunter : the lions then try to approach from behind , but are repelled turnaround : the dramatic confrontation , in a @entity14 safari park , continued for around half an hour the couple , from @entity62 , @entity63 , often visit the park but say this is the most incredible encounter they have seen			1
mrs @entity50 said : ' this was remarkable , going on for almost half an hour as the mother protected her calf ferociously from the young pride			2
' it was heart - in - the - mouth stuff as we felt we might be witnessing something brutal as the casual menace of the sub-adult lions showed little signs of abating			0
' eventually the giraffes got away and we breathed again			0
' kicheche co-owner and photographer guide @entity80 said : ' @entity82 managed to keep the camera still during all this drama			0
' i am supremely jealous of this encounter but also very happy for them , next time they come over i will stick to them like glue			0
