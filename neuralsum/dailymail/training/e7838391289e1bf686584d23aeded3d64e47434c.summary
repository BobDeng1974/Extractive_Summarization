by @entity0 perhaps @entity2 ’s fashion police were snoozing on the beat			0
showing her black lace bra in a backless , thigh - skimming dress , @entity5 made it into the exclusive royal enclosure – which is supposed to have the strictest dress requirements of all			1
the tattooed 23 - year - old dismissed the tough new sartorial regulations as ‘ pretentious ’ as she evaded the dress code assistants patrolling the turnstiles yesterday			1
dismissive : @entity5 , 23 , said the new regulations at @entity2 were ' pretentious ' she was in breach of two rules – giving a glimpse of her underwear and wearing a dress not of ‘ modest length ’ , both strictly prohibited in the prestigious enclosure			1
but it was the former private schoolgirl ’s nose ring and heavily tattooed arm which were more likely to provoke controversy			2
getting away with it : @entity5 showed her black lace bra in a backless , thigh - skimming dress while not against the regulations , they could cause a stir among the well - heeled guests at the genteel race meet			1
and one can only wonder what the @entity37 and the @entity38 , who were in attendance for the second day , made of the less than distinguished attire chosen by some racegoers			1
organisers have introduced a tough new dress code this year after increasing numbers of visitors were accused of falling on the wrong side of propriety			2
the revised regulations demand hats in the royal enclosure and fascinators in the grandstand			1
bottom - skimming skirts , strapless tops , halternecks and spaghetti straps are banned			1
fashion officers patrol the gates to hand out free pashminas , ties and fascinators to anyone who breaks the rules – while those who require a hat must pay a £ 50 cash deposit to encourage them to return it			2
yesterday , arts graduate @entity70 , who attended @entity72 ’s boarding school in @entity73 , @entity74 , now part of £ 29,000 - a - year @entity76 in @entity2 , said : ‘ i knew my dress was too short so i tugged it down just before i went through the gates			1
‘ i saw the stewards as i went into the enclosure , but i just thought “ whatever , i ’m having a good time , you have a good time ”			2
‘ i feel a bit bad about showing my bra at the back – but not really actually because you ca n’t please everyone			0
‘ i like that everyone gets dressed up for @entity2 but i think it ’s a little bit pretentious			0
‘ then again , you do n’t want everyone running around in here in mini-skirts and crop tops			2
’ when asked about her tattoos , which feature heavily down her left arm and include roses , ivy and a pocket watch , @entity70 , of @entity103 , south @entity104 , said : ‘ i did n’t even think twice about my tattoos			0
i do n’t think it ’s an issue these days at all and i think they are nice			0
’ the portrait artist shares her passion for inking with fellow racegoer @entity110 , 34 , who attracted attention at @entity2 on tuesday after removing her leather jacket to reveal heavily tattooed arms beneath a classy red dress and cherry - shaped headpiece			1
enjoying the day : the @entity37 wore pink while the @entity38 opted for a traditional grey top hat competitor : the @entity37 's horse @entity119 ran on day two of the race meet yesterday , the office worker , of @entity123 , south @entity104 , insisted her tattoos – which include two naked ladies and an octopus – were ‘ tasteful ’			1
she said : ‘ it is interesting that it has caused a stir			0
i had a really good day at @entity2 and no one made any untoward comments to me about my tattoos			0
‘ my tattoos were done by an amazing artist and i think mine are very tasteful , very artistic			0
they are a work of art. ‘ if i had badly done tattoos or offensive tattoos then i would certainly cover them up for the races			0
’ she described her tattoos as ‘ art nouveau ’ , saying they included a ‘ naked woman lying on her side ’ and the top half of a ‘ naked @entity144 lady ’			0
how the @entity145 revealed on wednesday that @entity2 's rules were being flouted both of the women were , she said , ‘ covering up their extremities ’			0
while the body art on show may have raised some eyebrows , plenty of racegoers passed the dress code test with flying colours yesterday – no doubt helped by the fact that many appeared to have followed in the immaculately shod footsteps of the @entity161			1
the grandstand was packed with women in knee - length shift dresses , skirt suits and nude court shoes that were similar to @entity161 ’s favourite @entity168 heels			2
it came days after the @entity161 , the @entity170 and the @entity171 all wore nude court shoes to the @entity173 service at @entity174			0
nurse @entity175 , 29 , of @entity176 , @entity177 , wore a pair of nude sling - back patent shoes with a blue and orange dress and nude - coloured hat for her visit to the races			1
she said : ‘ this is the first time i have worn nude heels but it went with my dress and there were so many in the shops			0
‘ i did n’t consciously choose them because @entity161 wears them but i suppose she has had an influence on women ’s fashion			0
she is certainly always very well dressed			0
’ and as always , the @entity37 showed racegoers how it should be done , wearing a powder pink hat and matching coat and dress to the event yesterday			1
her choice was welcomed by radiotherapist @entity202 , 23 , who remains on track to win £ 25,000 on a £ 5 bet with @entity205 if she guesses the colour of the @entity37 ’s hat every day of @entity2			1
she correctly predicted that the @entity37 would wear blue on tuesday			2
miss @entity202 , of @entity209 , said : ‘ i ’m in shock to be honest			0
it ’s crazy that she ’s actually wearing pink			2
i do n’t want to get carried away because there ’s still three days to go			0
’ glamorous : prince @entity215 's erstwhile paramour @entity214 ( left ) looked chic in a @entity217 dress at @entity2 , while @entity218 ( right ) was neat in white wool skirt suit too short ! the new regulations mean that high hemlines are banned in the @entity223 and @entity224 enclosure stylish : @entity225 wore a fabulous hat and white dress with a blue band			1
@entity229 wore a three - piece suit with skinny tie hoping for a winner : @entity171 , @entity171 cheers on the horses as @entity235 looks on emotional rollercoaster : @entity171 , @entity171 , could hardly bear to watch at one point but she appeared delighted as the runners in one race crossed the finish line star names : @entity243 racing driver @entity242 attended with his girlfriend @entity244 ( left ) while actor @entity245 was also among the spectators glitzy : steps singers @entity248 and @entity250 were among the elegantly dressed ladies at the event in harmony : retro girl band @entity255 retro girl band entertained visitors in matching red dresses and hats too revealing : six women handing out fliers and stickers for a local strip club were asked to leave not enough excitement ? a smartly - dressed racegoer dozes off on a bench			1
