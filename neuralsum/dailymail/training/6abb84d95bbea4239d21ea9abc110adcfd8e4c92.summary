by @entity0 published : 05:10 est , 22 may 2013 updated : 09:25 est , 22 may 2013 as princess @entity6 stepped out last night with her boyfriend of three years , the growing resemblance between her beau and her father was more striking than ever			2
when she picked barman @entity10 as her boyfriend , it 's unlikely princess @entity6 realised he would eventually become the spitting image of his potential father - in - law @entity13			1
the pair were pictured leaving the launch party of mr @entity16 's in @entity17 last night looking more in love than ever after spending the evening with @entity19 and @entity20 along with their partners @entity21 and @entity24			1
@entity6 and her boyfriend @entity10 stepped out last night ( left ) baring a strong resemblance to a young prince @entity13 and @entity26 in 1986 upon the announcement of their engagement ( right ) princess @entity6 's boyfriend @entity10 ( right ) looked remarkably similar to a young @entity13 ( left ) in his smart , dark outfit the pair , who have been dating since 2010 , looked very much in love as they shared a joke leaving the launch party of mr @entity16 's @entity6 looked elegant in a long sleeved white mini dress with a black belt emphasizing her waist			1
the dress featured a black lace panel at the front and the 23 - year - old princess accessorised with summery black cork - soled wedges which made the most of her slim , tanned legs , and a black handbag			0
she held hands and shared a laugh , with 26 - year - old @entity10 who buttoned up against the cold in a classic dark wool pea coat with the collar pulled up			0
underneath he wore dark suit trousers and shoes , in the same discreet and smart fashion so often seen on @entity6 ’s father @entity13			2
and with his curly dark hair and pale complexion , the similarity between @entity10 and his potential future father - in - law was undeniable			0
the couple are in fact distant cousins , sharing common ancestry , but @entity10 , 26 , keeps his feet firmly on the ground working as a waiter in @entity17 with his curly dark hair and pale complexion , the similarity between @entity10 ( left ) and his potential future father - in - law ( right with ex wife @entity70 ) is undeniable @entity10 may be working as a waiter and a barman , but his heritage is in fact exactly what you would expect from a royal escort			1
he was educated at pricey public school @entity78 and has an aristocratic background			0
in fact , so blue is his blood that he and @entity6 are actually distant cousins , with two of their closest common ancestors being @entity84 , the 2nd @entity85 ( died 1909 ) and @entity86 , 1st @entity87 ( died 1820 )			2
@entity88 and boyfriend @entity89 also attended the launch party last night @entity20 ( brother of the @entity92 ) and @entity24 joined the @entity94 crowd at the opening of mr @entity16 's in @entity96 @entity6 , who recently graduated from @entity97 with a degree in @entity100 literature and history of art , is clearly besotted with @entity10 , whom she has introduced to her family			1
@entity10 has even been on holiday with @entity6 ’s mother @entity104 of @entity105 and her sister @entity106			0
though her parents divorced when she was just 6 years old , both @entity6 and her sister remain close to their father , who is fourth in line to the throne .			0
