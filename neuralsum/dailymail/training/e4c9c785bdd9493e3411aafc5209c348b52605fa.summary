@entity1 babies struggle with their native lingo and find it easier to understand @entity4 , a new university study shows			1
boffins from the @entity8 ( @entity8 ) conducted research on 48 @entity1 babies of 15 - months - old and were astonished to discover they ca n't distinguish certain vowels			1
yet when they heard the same words in a @entity4 accent they found them easier to understand			2
' tie me kangaroo down ? ' @entity1 babies are baffled by the accent and find @entity4 easier to understand associate professor @entity17 , who led the research with the university 's dr @entity19 , says : ' @entity22 infants are more likely to understand words spoken in their native languages			1
' we wanted to find out what accent they would be most comfortable when learning the words			0
' but surprisingly our study found the normal home - ground advantage does n't always apply for babies exposed to @entity1 @entity32			2
' researchers from the @entity8 split 48 babies into two groups to teach them words @entity1 @entity32 is easily recognised by its distinctive vowel sounds and rising inflection so to test the tots researchers divided them into two groups			1
one half of the group listened to @entity1 @entity32 and the other 24 @entity4 @entity32			2
' we tried to see whether children had more difficulties if they heard words spoken in one accent as opposed to another accent in @entity32 , ' adds professor @entity17			0
the babies in each group were shown an object , and heard the name for the object repeated over and over , spoken by a speaker of @entity1 @entity32 or @entity4 @entity32 the babies in each group were shown an object , and heard the name for that object repeated over and over , spoken by a speaker of @entity1 @entity32 or @entity4 @entity32			1
they were also taught a made - up word , ' deet ' and showed picture associations for easy recognition			0
shortly afterwards they were then tested again to see if they noticed when the sound changed to ' dit ' and ' doot ' and the babies listening to the @entity1 speaker did n't notice the vowel changes			1
but the infants listening to the @entity4 @entity32 speaker picked up the change in the word			0
researcher dr @entity19 , from the @entity74 's @entity73 , says that by the age of 15 months babies ' brains understand sounds , and picking up new words and the new vowels can be confusing			2
researcher dr @entity19 from the @entity83 says that by the age of 15 months babies ' brains understand sounds , are picking up new words and the new vowels can be confusing ' some @entity1 @entity32 vowels , such as the ones in " sheep , " " ship " and " shoot " are very close to one another , ' adds professor @entity17			1
' as opposed to the same @entity4 @entity32 vowels which are more distinct			0
we now know these @entity1 @entity32 vowel differences are not easy to learn			0
' mothers instinctively emphasize the different vowels when they talk to their babies and professor @entity17 says the research can help with teaching the language to immigrants			0
surprisingly the babies understood the @entity4 accent better than the same words said in @entity1 ' the @entity1 accent may make it a little harder for @entity1 infants to master some vowels , ' she says , ' but it does n't make a difference in the long run			1
' for adult migrants to @entity1 who are just starting to pick up the language , they may take a bit longer to master @entity1 @entity32			0
' the researchers are now going to re-create the study with @entity4 babies to see which accent they understand better , and they 're also going to test older infants			2

university study finds @entity1 babies *prefer* @entity4 accents
the 48 bubs tested were confused by the sound of @entity1 vowels
*pronunciation* of words like sheep , ship or shoot could be *misunderstood*
