@entity0 was mocked last night for calling on @entity1 to let her know every time @entity3 jets took off to bomb @entity5 militants in @entity6			1
party sources said the @entity9 deputy leader made the request at an emergency shadow cabinet meeting last week			2
it had been called to finalise the party ’s position before last friday ’s commons vote authorising military action against @entity18 fanatics			0
’ last night , even her party colleagues were quick to brand the request ‘ farcical ’			0
one senior @entity9 mp said : ‘ the idea that someone gives @entity0 a ring as our @entity32 are given the final order to go into action in @entity6 is just bonkers			1
‘ once political authority is given for military action , it ’s largely down to the military			0
’ even ms @entity0 's party colleagues have branded her request as ' farcical ' @entity44 mp colonel @entity43 , ex-commander of @entity46 forces in @entity47 , said : ‘ the idea of informing politicians not even in the government when a military operation is about to take place is daft			2
’ last night , a source close to ms @entity0 said : ‘ she was just concerned that everything should be done to ensure that the bombing did not unintentionally kill civilians			0
’ party sources also claimed that @entity59 , a key adviser to @entity60 , had urged him to persuade the government to put a time limit on the military action in @entity6			1
a source said : ‘ @entity43 wanted @entity9 to insist on a so - called “ sunset clause ” on the bombing but he was overruled			1
’ the prime minister last week told mps that the battle against the @entity5 militants could take ‘ not months but years ’ .			0

@entity0 ' surprised everyone ' by making the request of the *pm*
which even her own @entity9 colleagues *labelled* as ' farcical '
@entity60 was also urged to put a ' sunset clause ' on bombing @entity6
