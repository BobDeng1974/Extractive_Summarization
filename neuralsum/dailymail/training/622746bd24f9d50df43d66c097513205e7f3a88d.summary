by @entity0 when it was first manufactured in 1948 , the @entity1 was seen as an innovative car that could be driven by a peasant			0
nicknamed the ' @entity1 ' , it has now become a classic , known for being easy to drive , cheap and simple to maintain			2
that 's why a group of motoring enthusiasts have clubbed together to modify 16 of the vehicles and race them in some of the world 's most stunning locations			1
their first excursion , the @entity15 , was a 2,000 mile , 12 - day trip around @entity17 , encompassing the @entity18 , a number of souks , the @entity21 and the magnificent sunsets			1
the cars have a measly 29 brake horse powers and can reach speeds of up to 75mph , but were still able to tackle the gruelling terrain			1
@entity27 , 60 , from @entity28 , @entity29 , who organsied the trip , said : ' they are iconic cars			2
they are not fast , but people still love seeing them on the road			0
we just wanted to do something different			0
they are easy to drive and they hold onto the road well			0
' the race , held over numerous stages , was won by former @entity43 , @entity44 , who helped @entity45 win the @entity47 title in 1976			1
the @entity55 classic , also known as a ' @entity1 ' , has a measly 29 brake horse powers held up : a convoy of the @entity50 slow down as a local walks his two camels across the desert			1
their journey took in various terrains including sand , gravel , mud and tarmac surface : the team , who wanted to do something ' completely different ' , aimed to visit the roads less travelled @entity74 - covered mountains : the fleet of 16 cars , which were modified using parts bought off @entity78 , were set different tasks on different days of the race			1
they included time trials and average speed tests one draws out the name of the car in letters as the sun sets over the desert the first design by @entity91 in the early 1930s was for a low - priced , rugged ' umbrella on four wheels '			2
the aim was that two peasants would be able to drive 100kg of farm goods to market at around 40mph , wearing clogs and across muddy unpaved roads if necessary			0
but when it was first manufactured in @entity55 in 1948 , it was considered technologically advanced , innovative and stood out with its unconventional appearance			2
it featured four - wheel suspension , front wheel drive , inboard brakes , and even detachable body panels			2
@entity109 journalist @entity108 described it as : ' the most intelligent application of minimalism ever to succeed as a car			0
' the @entity1 also became a huge commercial trimpuh after just a couple of months on sale , there was a three - year waiting list			0
production was increased from four units per day in 1949 to 400 units per day in 1950			0
some of the early models were built at @entity127 « n 's plant in @entity125 , @entity126			0
after nearly 50 years , the last was produced in 1990 and driven out of a @entity128 , @entity129 where manufacturing had moved			0
more than 5 million were produced			0
upgrade : the group of motoring enthusiasts and former racing drivers installed roll cages into the cars which have a top speed of around 75mph after dark : drivers park one of the 66 - year - old cars on a hill in order to watch the sunset over the desert rubble : the cars took on narrow roads surrounded by rocks			1
the route included passes over the @entity18 and the @entity21 @entity149 : the cars , which are nearly 70 years old , had to navigate sharp turns surrounded by steep drops spectators : locals greeted them as they wove through a remote village			0
a support crew followed the vehicles to make sure they stayed on the road difficult terrain : the cars are parked up as the team climb to the top of a sand dune in the middle of the desert			0
the team carried wheel - rims - 102 in total - tyres , engines and gearboxes during the trip overtake : on the tarmac roads they covered during the trip , they passed other forms of transport , including a donkey being led by a local wildlife : the team met companions during the trip , including a monkey on the side of a road			2
the team said they had limited mechanical problems during the journey entrance : one of the cars passes through a gate outside the desert town of @entity195 , en route to the sandy roads of @entity17 architecture : another vehicle passes through the archway of a desert town			1
special stages tested the cars ' abilities to maintain an average speed over a distance causing a splash : a lead car drives through a puddle on one of @entity17 's rural roads			1
the race was won by former @entity43 , @entity213 , who helped @entity45 to an @entity215 victory in 1976 winding road : a sign warns the drivers of the potential obstacles that lie ahead on the stage			1
the cars were painted red and white for the trip and given special branding team photo : each of the drivers stand out of the @entity1 's open roofs as they stop at a hotel for the night weaving : the team had to dodge ruined , derelict buildings in the desert as they braved temperatures in excess of @entity234 speed : even though the car struggles to reach 30mph , it was captured dashing across the desert by one of the group 's photographers convoy : the team follow each other on one of the rare , two - lane , tarmac roads dissecting a remote part of @entity248 in a flash : the group behind the @entity251 said they wanted to explore the relatively untouched routes around @entity17 break : @entity213 , who rose from a cleaner to @entity255 in the @entity47 setup , steps out of the car to refill the petrol tank motor racing legend : mr @entity44 ( left ) raises a glass after his victory in the 12 - day rally			1
the group will return to @entity17 for the rally next year			1
