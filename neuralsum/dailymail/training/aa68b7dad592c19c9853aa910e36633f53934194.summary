@entity0 may be using thousands of miles of underground tunnels to hide a nuclear missile arsenal that is far bigger than current estimates , according to researchers			1
they spent three years translating secret military documents , scouring the internet and studying satellite images for clues – and concluded that @entity0 may have as many as 3,000 missiles , compared with general estimates of between 80 and 400			1
the researchers at @entity15 , led by a former senior @entity13 official , concentrated on a 3,000 - mile network of tunnels dug largely in @entity19 province by the @entity20 , a secretive unit responsible for protecting the country ’s nuclear weapons			1
stockpiling : missiles being test - fired at an undisclosed location			0
a group of university students have uncovered evidence that @entity0 may have many more nuclear weapons than previously thought capabilities : after translating secret military documents , forums and studying images of a network of tunnels in @entity0 , the students believe the country could have as many as 3,000 warheads in 2008 , thousands of radiation technicians were sent to the region after it was hit by a huge earthquake			1
when tv pictures showed oddly collapsed hills across the province , officials eventually admitted there was a network of tunnels underneath , dubbing it their ‘ @entity50 ’			0
the 363 - page study , as yet unpublished , has been discussed in @entity52 and circulated among defence officials			0
it was commissioned as ‘ homework ’ by the students ’ professor , @entity56 , a prominent @entity58 defence strategist during the @entity59			0
‘ it ’s not quite a bombshell , but those thoughts and estimates are being checked against what people think they know based on classified information , ’ said a defence department official			0
critics have questioned the study ’s use of internet research , including blogs and even a @entity0 tv drama about artillerymen			1
concerns : a @entity0 naval vessel fires missiles during an exercise off the @entity80 peninsula nuclear analyst @entity81 said the tunnels might encourage the @entity0 to have fewer rather than more missiles in the belief that they were better protected			2
nuclear non-proliferation campaigners have also attacked the report , saying it will undermine efforts to reduce atomic weapon stockpiles			0
but @entity91 of the @entity92 , an international security think - tank , said the report highlighted ‘ the uncertainty about what @entity0 has ’			2
might : @entity0 's military has been expanding rapidly and in 2009 it admitted the existence of 3,000 miles of underground tunnels force : new recruits for the @entity101 stand at attention in @entity103			1
the study also shows how the military transports missiles through its tunnel network professor @entity56 said : ‘ i do n’t have the slightest idea how many nuclear weapons @entity0 really has , but neither does anyone else in the arms - control community			1
‘ that ’s the problem with @entity0 – no one really knows except them			0
’ @entity0 has long been the most secretive of the five nuclear powers recognised by the international @entity116			2
while @entity117 and @entity118 have bilateral treaties that ensure their stockpiles are monitored , the @entity0 have simply claimed they keep a small number of missiles for ‘ minimum deterrence ’			0
the @entity118 has 5,000 nuclear warheads , and @entity117 8,000			2
underground : the study began after the 2008 earthquake in @entity19 province revealed strangely collapsed hills that were believe to have tunnels underneath them			1

@entity15 student spent three years translating secret military documents and blogs
focus of research centred on 3,000 miles of underground tunnels dug by @entity141
@entity143 *launched* after 2008 earthquake in @entity19 revealed existence of collapsed tunnels
study claims @entity0 could have as many as 3,000 nuclear warheads - far more then current estimates of between 80 and 400
