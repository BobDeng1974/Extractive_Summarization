by @entity1 reporter published : 23:37 est , 19 july 2013 updated : 07:05 est , 20 july 2013 @entity2 says @entity4 's future is bright , saying that her hometown may be " bankrupt monetarily but we are well - funded in spirit and what it takes to come back '			1
the ' @entity2 ' had her publicist release a hopeful statement in light of the city 's bankruptcy on thursday			1
she says ' between new and dynamic leadership with the @entity15 , the private sector and a little help from @entity18 , @entity4 's best and most glorious days are still ahead '			1
preach : @entity2 had some encouraging words for her hometown , saying that from a little help from various friends they will be able to bring themselves back extreme : @entity4 's emergency financial manager @entity25 explains his decision to make the city file for bankruptcy living problems : it can take police nearly an hour to respond to a 911 call and despite razing close to 10,000 vacant houses , three times as many still stand with windows smashed and doors ripped off the @entity15 car manufacturers - @entity38 , @entity39 , and @entity40 - were the companies that helped drive the @entity42 city to its glory days in the 1950s and 1960s			1
now the city is a shadow of its former self , with a host of overwhelming bills that forced the mayor to declare the region bankrupt			2
for decades , @entity4 paid its bills by borrowing money while struggling to provide the most basic of services for its residents			2
it can take police nearly an hour to respond to a 911 call and despite razing close to 10,000 vacant houses , three times as many still stand with windows smashed and doors ripped off			0
at night , many streets and even freeways are dangerously shrouded in darkness because tens of thousands of street lights do n't work			0
the 1950s proved to be the truly bustling time for the car factories , like the @entity40 plant seen here in 1954 proud of their products : the @entity73 , seen here in 1960 , was a spectacle and a way for the workers of the city to display their efforts before it broke : even in 1993 the car industry was still in place , even though it had deteriorated to a shadow of its former self the city was about to default on a good chunk of its $ 14billion - plus debt , but now it will get a second chance in a federal bankruptcy court - led restructuring			1
@entity4 's budget deficit this year alone is estimated at $ 380million , and @entity25 , its state - appointed emergency manager , chose bankruptcy over diverting money from police , fire and other services to make debt payments			1
the move conserves cash so the city can operate , but it will hurt @entity4 's image for years			1
it also leaves creditors with pennies on the dollar and places in jeopardy the pension benefits of thousands of city retirees			0
while the drastic move may seem quick , it took decades of decay to bring down the once - mighty industrial giant that put the world on wheels			0
simmering problems : mobs overturned cars at a 1943 race rally , as tensions between white and black residents came to a head - and not for the last time different issues : this 1984 riot came out of celebration when the @entity126 beat the @entity127 in the @entity128 the city grew to 1.8 million people in the 1950s , luring them with plentiful jobs that paid good wages to stamp out automobiles for sale across the globe			0
but like many @entity138 cities , @entity4 's fall began late that decade as developers starting building suburbs			1
then came the 1967 riots that accelerated the number of white residents who moved to the cities north of @entity144 , considered the region 's racial dividing line			0
rapper @entity148 starred in the movie he created about the infamous road , bringing the notion of the tough streets surrounding @entity144 to a national audience			0
at the same time , auto companies began opening plants in other cities , and the rise of autos imported from @entity159 started to cut the size of the @entity138 auto industry			2
@entity4 's property values fell , tax revenue dropped , police could n't control a growing murder rate , and many middle - class blacks fled the city for safer suburbs with better schools			1
back when it was booming : the ' @entity172 ' smokestacks ( seen here in 1996 ) were a poignant display of how pivotal industry was to the heart of the city native sons : singers @entity148 and @entity180 are both from the city , and @entity148 made a movie about the infamous eight mile road by 2009 , the auto industry collapsed along with the economy as a whole , eventually pulling the city down with it			2
government corruption under former mayor @entity188 only made things worse			0
in the 2000 census , @entity4 's population fell under 1 million in as the exodus continued			1
today it 's barely above 700,000			0
unlike a business that declares bankruptcy , the city faces a number of structural and logistical challenges that may impede a speedy recovery			0
structural issues : with so many abandoned and ransacked buildings , city administrators will likely have trouble bringing people back to the areas needed to have a flourishing city bust : after its boom years @entity4 began a steady decline industry : factories such as the @entity211 , which helped @entity4 become wealthy , are now abandoned whereas companies can cut departments and outsource to cheaper regions , @entity4 ca n't send its decaying neighborhoods elsewhere			1
thousands of retired city workers could lose at least part of their pension benefits			0
concessions could be forced upon dozens of city unions , including pay and benefit cuts			0
creditors whom @entity4 owes more than $ 14billion will have to take pennies on the dollar			1
desolate : the once - thriving city is struggling to convince residents to stay that said , free of these financial burdens , @entity4 will be able to concentrate its limited dollars on services such as basic police and fire protection			2
better services could bring more people and lure more business investment			0
already the downtown and an area to the north called @entity242 are seeing business and residential growth - signs that @entity4 has a future .			2

@entity4 filed for bankruptcy as it is more than $ 14billion in debt
@entity252 's ' glory days ' were when car companies had booming plants and factories in @entity4 , producing millions
now there are only about 700,000 living in the area ; city was forced to raze 10,000 empty homes because they were unsafe
