one of the biggest concerns for owners of electric cars is that their battery could run out at any moment , leaving them stranded with no recharging station nearby			0
so - called ' range anxiety ' is a fear that has apparently plagued some owners of @entity13 ’s @entity12 vehicle , but now ceo @entity14 has revealed he has a solution			1
in a tweet he said he would reveal a way to tackle the issue at a conference on thursday , and while no further details are known , it seems the smart money may be on either navigation software that shows the best route to a charging station or an update that boosts the car 's battery power			1
@entity28 - based @entity13 is to announce a software update on friday			1
@entity14 revealed it would be for the ' entire model s fleet ' in a tweet			1
this suggests it may be a trick to boost the battery power of the car ( @entity12 pictured in a promotional shot )			1
others have suggested it could be new turn by turn navigation software in the @entity42 said : ‘ @entity13 press conf at 9am [ @entity43 , 4pm gmt ] on @entity45			1
‘ about to end range anxiety … via @entity48 software update			1
‘ affects entire @entity12 fleet			0
’ running low on fuel and making a desperate search for the nearest station could soon be a thing of the past			2
earlier this month @entity56 unveiled its latest app that not only shows how far you can travel on the power you have remaining , it bases its predictions on your unique driving style			0
the @entity62 also lets drivers remotely access their vehicles meaning they can set the cabin temperature on a cold morning before they leave their house			0
the app was announced at @entity68 in @entity69 and currently works with a selection of @entity56 ’s electric and hybrid cars			0
that @entity14 says this is a software update seemingly rules out one theory , namely more of @entity13 ’s ‘ supercharger ’ stations being added			1
however , the fact that it affects the entire @entity12 fleet may also pour cold water on the ‘ turn by turn navigation ’ theory			2
this is because not every car has the ability to have such a feature , so unless @entity14 is planning to upgrade those that are not with new hardware , this may seem unlikely			0
several outlets have been reporting that the answer may lie in some trickery with the car ’s software that can boost the battery power			1
in a survey for @entity99 in 2012 , 77 per cent of respondents said limited range was their biggest concern with electric cars			0
the official range of the @entity12 at the moment is up to 310 miles ( 500km ) , which is apparently not enough to quell range anxiety for some drivers			2
that @entity14 says in his tweet ( shown ) this is a software update seemingly rules out one theory , namely more of @entity13 ’s ‘ supercharger ’ stations being added			1
however , the fact that it affects the entire @entity12 fleet may also pour cold water on the ‘ turn by turn navigation ’ theory - as not all the cars have this ability only certain models of @entity13 's @entity12 car have the ability to charge their car quickly at the company 's supercharger stations , which @entity13 lets owners of the @entity12 use for free			1
however , the stations are quite few and far between , especially in the @entity125 , at the moment @entity127 noted that , last year , @entity13 upgraded its @entity129 electric car , increasing its range from 245 to 400 miles ( 395 to 645km ) on a single charge			2
this was via a lithium battery pack upgrade and , at the time , @entity14 tellingly tweeted : ‘ should mention that a battery pack upgrade is not coming soon for the @entity12 , but it obviously * will * happen long - term			2
’ @entity14 has since deleted that tweet , though - perhaps in anticipation of this latest announcement			0
‘ @entity14 said that all @entity12 cars will get the update - if so , that points to battery optimisations , a power - saving mode or smarter navigation , ' added @entity144			2
software updates to the @entity12 are n’t unprecedented , either ; in january , an update increased the speed of the top - of - the - line @entity148 via use of ‘ insane mode ’ - enabling the car to go 0 to 60mph ( 97km/h ) in 3.2 seconds , compared to the usual 5.9 seconds			0
but aside from speculation , there is n’t much that can be done except wait to see what exactly @entity14 will reveal on friday			0
