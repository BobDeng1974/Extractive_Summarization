@entity0 has brushed aside concerns over his form ahead of @entity5 's @entity4 opener against @entity6			1
the @entity5 captain has scored just two runs in his past four innings , including consecutive first - ball ducks against @entity6 , ahead of saturday 's clash at the @entity12			1
' ( i 'm ) not really that concerned , ' he said			2
@entity0 says he is n't too concerned by his recent patchy form as @entity5 prepare to open their @entity4 campaign against @entity6 at the @entity12 on saturday @entity0 tries a bit of rugby on the training ground at the @entity12 ahead of @entity5 's @entity4 opener the @entity5 skipper appeared to have some acumen for the oval - ball game ' i went through a bit of a bad patch before @entity25 and i feel , since i started with the @entity26 at the @entity27 , i 've started to turn things around			1
' i 've had a couple of low scores but i 'll look to cash in on saturday if i manage to get past 10 - 20 balls			1
' the left - hander is taking comfort in the fact that it was only at the start of the tour that he defiantly hit a century against @entity6 at the @entity37			1
' i think it is four or five games since i scored a hundred so i do n't have to look that far back to actually reconnect with what works well for me , ' he said			2
' i took a lot from that hundred i scored at @entity37 , particularly because it was against @entity6 , and the first game is a big game against @entity6 so i 'll take a lot of confidence from that game			1
' @entity0 ( middle ) shares a joke with @entity49 ( left ) and @entity50 during @entity5 's training session on thursday coach @entity52 ( right ) joins in the hilarity as @entity49 , @entity0 and @entity50 crack the jokes @entity55 runs with the ball during a game of touch rugby in training at the @entity12 on thursday he added : ' i find it really easy to reconnect with the past and what i do well and can be very individually focussed when the chips are down			1
' i 've done that in the past on a number of occasions when i 've gone through low scores			0
i know that i have done it and come out the other side			0
' if @entity0 was looking to move on quickly from the subject , he was given little chance to do so			2
the first question from the home media focused on his bizarre dismissal in wednesday 's four - wicket warm - up defeat to @entity78 in @entity37			0
@entity0 somehow managed to direct his third delivery , a full toss from leg - spinner @entity81 , to slip and he was reluctant to re-live the moment 24 hours on			2
. ' my dismissal was i played a shot that i played , maybe , thousands of times , ' he said			0
' usually it results in the ball going over 45 on the leg - side			0
it caught the top edge and went to slip			0
' asked if that was a concerning to get out given his form , he added : ' no '			0
@entity96 takes over possession as @entity5 make their final plans for saturday 's @entity6 opener @entity0 cracks a joke with bowlers @entity103 , @entity96 and @entity104 in training @entity0 takes a catch during fielding practice at the @entity12 on thursday @entity0 was equally as brief when asked to discuss news from earlier in the day that his opposite number , @entity110 , would definitely miss the match as he continues his much - talked about return from hamstring surgery			1
' it does n't really bother me , ' he said			0
' whatever team they put out does n't really bother us			0
it 's really important that we focus on what we do			0
' @entity0 confirmed that @entity5 would not name their team until just before the match , although they are likely to call upon at least six @entity4 debutants			1
with a sell - out 90,000 @entity12 crowd set to be baying for @entity126 blood it promises to be a baptism of fire for @entity5 's young guns			2
they do have prior @entity12 experience , however , with only @entity132 and @entity133 having not played a competitive match at the ground , and @entity0 believes that not only can his players handle any white - hot atmosphere , but that they have played in more hostile venues			2
' it is certainly going to be a challenge , ' he said			0
' in regard to the ground it is quite a big stadium			0
the majority of our guys have played here before - there 's only two that have n't - and the guys that have played here before say that although it is a fantastic venue to play when you are in the middle you are so far away from the crowd			0
@entity96 and @entity132 go through their stretching exercises during the training session @entity5 's fielding coach @entity156 is challenged by @entity133 during the touch rugby match @entity158 returns the ball during a fielding drill at the @entity12 as @entity5 get ready for the @entity4 @entity5 gather for a team talk on the outfield ahead of their training session ' it 's a big @entity165 oval , so in regards to places where we 've played before where it is quite intimidating , it 's not on top of you			1
' @entity0 then sought to pour the pressure on @entity6 - and co-hosts @entity175 who @entity5 meet in their second group game - by suggesting such a large home following could be detrimental			1
' they 've had a good run of it , as have @entity175 for a while , which probably makes @entity6 favourites and @entity175 second favourites and with that brings a lot of pressure , ' he said			2
' i know sometimes it is a nice pressure to have , in front of your own fans , there will be 90,000 fans cheering them on - but if it goes against them it will be interesting to see how they react			0
' regardless of the crowd @entity5 will need to arrest a poor recent one - day record against @entity6 in their own backyard - they have lost 13 of their past 15 games - if they are to begin the tournament with a win			1
more recently they lost all three games in the tri-series , including a 112 - run defeat in the final , but @entity0 remains confident his team can pull off an opening - night shock			1
' if we can produce what i believe is our best cricket on saturday we 'll be able to beat @entity6 , ' he said .			1
