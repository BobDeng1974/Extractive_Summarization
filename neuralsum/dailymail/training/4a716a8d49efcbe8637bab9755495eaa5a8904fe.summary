by @entity0 published : 12:39 est , 3 march 2014 updated : 14:02 est , 3 march 2014 a three - year - old heart patient died following a major delay in getting a key hospital appointment because of a glitch with a new @entity7 computer booking system , an inquest has heard			1
@entity9 was born with a congenital cardiac defect , but underwent surgery not long after his birth and made a good recovery			1
medics treating the little boy said he would still need regular tests to check on his progress but @entity18 heard that @entity9 did not have a crucial scan for 20 months after his first major operation			1
@entity9 , three , died after a computer glitch meant he did not have a check - up for 20 months			1
he was born with a heart condition and underwent surgery when he was nine months old it also heard that the delay came after a new computer booking system called @entity28 was rolled out			1
once an appointment had been made and a detailed check - up was carried out , doctors found @entity9 needed open heart surgery			1
during that procedure he suffered a stroke			0
further complications then followed and and he died in the arms of his parents @entity38 and @entity39 at @entity41 ’s @entity40 a few weeks later			2
a tearful ms @entity38 told the inquest she expected her son to get a check - up in early 2011 - but said she was left feeling ' dejected ' and ' alarmed ' when the appointment did not go ahead until the summer of 2012			1
she told the inquest of the moment she kissed her son goodbye			2
she said : ' he was a kind and gentle boy with a great understanding of the world			0
' as we read @entity9 his favourite stories , he died in our arms			1
' @entity9 was born with a restricted pulmonary artery - causing blood to easily flow away from his heart to his lungs			1
@entity9 had an operation at @entity60 and he was recovering well initially			1
however , his heart then began to struggle but this was not picked up because he went for so long without a check - up ms @entity38 said the condition was picked up during her 20 week scan			1
he was born 39 weeks into her pregnancy , on june 15 , 2009 weighing @entity66			2
but despite his heart problem ms @entity38 said her child continued to flourish , and had required little medical intervention			2
his parents were also told to expect for their son to undergo around three operations by the time he was aged five			2
on march 3 , 2010 , @entity9 had his first surgical procedure - open heart surgery at @entity60			1
he was discharged six days later , and referred to the @entity74 at the @entity75 ( @entity75 ) in @entity76 for check - ups			1
the inquest heard the first of these took place in @entity41 in october 2010 , and an echocardiogram , also known as an ' echo ' , was carried out			0
ms @entity38 said she was told the procedure would next be carried out early into the new year			0
she added : ' we left the hospital comfortable knowing this information			0
' however , at the next appointment , which took place in @entity76 the following april , ms @entity38 said she was ' surprised that no echo ' was undertaken			0
the doctor told @entity9 ’s parents he had n’t expected to see the youngster and swiftly moved them on without performing an echo scan			1
but despite expecting to return six months later as instructed , they were not given an appointment until 14 months later			2
he underwent surgery at @entity60 on august 7 , 2012			0
distraught ms @entity38 said she begged a district nurse to help but she still struggled to get vital appointments at the @entity75 in @entity76			0
reading a statement , she said : ' we were expecting an appointment in the @entity103 ( 2011 ) - something we took to mean january - but we still had n’t received one by march			2
' we got @entity106 , our community nurse , to call the hospital			0
she called them on the 12th march , 20th march , 8th may , 28th may and the 29th may			0
' we were then given an appointment for 14th june but we already had commitments then so it was rescheduled for 21st june			0
@entity9 was due to have his check ups at @entity75 , @entity76 , but they became sporadic			1
a report has suggested a new computer - based patient booking system introduced at the @entity75 in 2011 was to blame by the time @entity9 's failing health was diagnosed he was very weak and he had to have more heart surgery			1
he died a month later following complications			1
an inquest into his death is due to open at @entity120 ( pictured ) on monday ' when we got there dr @entity121 said that he had expected to see us a lot earlier than this			2
' after doing an echo scan he told us he did n’t want to shock us but he wanted @entity9 to have heart surgery that spring			1
' we were shocked , we had n’t been expecting this			0
it was n’t meant to happen			0
' @entity9 had a cardiac catheter inserted in july , before undergoing surgery in august			1
' just hours before his operation @entity9 was dancing around the ward and telling the nurses all about @entity136 - we had to remind him to quieten down , ' ms @entity38 said			1
' many of the nurses on the ward could not believe how energetic he was considering the surgery he was about to have - he was a happy and healthy boy			2
' after the operation , on august 9 , as they began bringing @entity9 out of sedation his left arm started flailing			2
' we were ( later ) told @entity9 had had a stroke and several cardiac arrests			2
' his condition continued to deteriorate and on september 6 , his parents were recommended for treatment to be withdrawn following the onset of a second cardiac arrest			0
experienced medic dr @entity121 broke down in tears as he recalled that moment during his evidence			0
' it is not ideal to take a child off ( life support ) ...			0
. but it was the right decision '			0
dr @entity121 said the decision to operate had been prompted after the discovery that @entity9 's heart valves had thickened and become blocked			1
' had i seen this in january i would have gone ahead with the same treatment			0
' would it have made a difference ? logically the earlier you catch something then the result might be better			0
' but i have no evidence in this case when you are looking at a patient with this condition			0
' yes i would have seen the obstruction ( earlier ) , but i ca n't say whether that would have changed the outcome entirely			0
' @entity9 's cause of death was given as complex congenital heart disease and said to be ' multifactorial '			1
among the four main findings in his post mortem included sepsis ( infection ) and clotting abnormalities			0

@entity9 was born with a heart condition - had surgery at nine months
he was recovering well and was meant to have regular check - ups
a computer glitch meant he did not have an appointment for 20 months
by the time he finally had a scan his condition had deteriorated a lot
