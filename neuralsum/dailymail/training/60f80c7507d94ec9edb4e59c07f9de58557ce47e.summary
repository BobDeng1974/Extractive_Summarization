by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 07:56 est , 20 november 2012 updated : 12:18 est , 20 november 2012 lord @entity2 said older peers would be willing to stand aside , if they were given a ' retirement gratuity ' elderly peers are offering to retire from the @entity6 - but only if they get a huge pay - off equivalent to a year ’s expenses			1
the extraordinary proposal is being actively discussed in the corridors of @entity11			0
it even appears to have the backing of a @entity15 cabinet minister , after lord @entity16 revealed he is keen to create a ’ retirement scheme ’			1
under existing rules , peers are not able to retire from the @entity6			2
the only way the number of people sitting eligible to sit on the red benches can be reduced easily is if they die			1
there are around 770 peers able to sit in the @entity6			2
one in five is over 80 and around half are over 70 years old			0
some 20 per cent have been in the @entity6 for more than 20 years			0
with scores of new appointments made by successive governments , many of whom are comparatively young , numbers have ballooned			0
now peers are openly discussing the idea of older members being eased out , but only if they are handed a bounty worth potentially more than £ 40,000			1
lord @entity2 said : ‘ a number of noble lords of mature years have indicated that they might consider the possibility of honourable voluntary retirement given an incentive — say , in the form of a retirement gratuity equivalent to the expenses that they had claimed in the previous year ? ’ the @entity6 has swelled to some 760 peers , with an average age of 69 peers are able to claim £ 300 for each day they attend			1
with the house sitting for around 145 days a year , it means they could claim up to £ 43,500			1
lord @entity2 warned that without a golden goodbye , elderly peers would not be persuaded to step aside			1
‘ some have indicated that , in the absence of such an incentive , it is likely that they would continue to stay in the @entity6 indefinitely			0
’ @entity60 ’s attempt to introduce elected peers was abandoned in the summer , after @entity62 made clear he could not persuade his @entity15 mps to back it			2
@entity15 cabinet minister @entity16 said he was open to the idea of peers being able to retire but @entity15 cabinet minister @entity16 encouraged those wanting a pay - off to retire from the red benches to come forward			1
around 40 peers have died since the general election , he said			0
‘ it is likely that we will lose a similar number between now and the next general election			0
i have heard it whispered in the corridors that the @entity6 is increasingly keen to debate and discuss some form of retirement scheme , including an age limit			0
i very much welcome all those who wish to come forward with such thoughts			0
’ @entity84 peer @entity83 introduced a @entity85 earlier this year which would allow peers to retire			1
it would also anyone who had been to jail from returning to the red benches and give authorities tougher powers to suspend members			1
but so far it has not been backed by the government and stands little chance of becoming law			0
instead , two @entity15 peers jailed for expenses fraud are back in the @entity6 , and claiming public money again			2
from april to june @entity102 , the former @entity103 leader of @entity104 , received £ 8,481			0
and lord @entity105 claimed £ 2,100 for seven days in june .			2

lord @entity2 says ' mature ' peers would be willing to quit the red benches for a ' retirement gratuity '
payout equal to a year *'s* expenses could be worth more than £ 40,000
cabinet minister @entity16 says he is open to the idea
