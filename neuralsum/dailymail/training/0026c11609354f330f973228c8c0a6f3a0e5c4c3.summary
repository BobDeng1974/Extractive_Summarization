if you 're prone to feeling low and lethargic , a device that can change your mood at the touch of a button may be a godsend			2
scientists have developed a headset that uses electrical impulses to alter your mood by using a smartphone – and it should be on sale next year			2
the device currently consists of a set of electrodes connected to a phone and produces a short - lived energising effect that feels a little like drinking a can of @entity16 , @entity17 reported			1
scientists have developed a headset that uses electricity to change your mood by using a smartphone – and it should be on sale next year			2
the device currently consists of a set of electrodes ( illustrated with a stock picture ) connected to a phone to administer an almost imperceptible shock the start - up behind the device , called @entity29 , said it can also be used to produce a calming effect stronger than drinking a few pints of beers or taking a pill with drowsy side effects			1
co-founder @entity35 , a professor at @entity36 , explained that the time the relaxing feeling lasts , which can feel similar to mediation , varies from person to person			1
the device works by using a type of transcranial direct current stimulation ( @entity43 ) where a barely imperceptible electrical current is applied when a user presses a button on the smartphone			1
the device produces a short - lived energising effect that feels a little like drinking a can of @entity16 the skin is mildly shocked behind the ear for an energising effect and on the temple and the back of the next for the relaxing effect			1
whereas previous @entity43 research has focused on using electricity to affect the outer part of the brain , the headset targets specific nerves and muscles just beneath the skin to create the strong effects			2
@entity65 , a professor of biomedical engineering at @entity67 , recently used a prototype of @entity29 ’s device for a 100 - person study looking at the device ’s calming effects			2
the experiment was funded by the company , which has recently raised $ 13 million ( £ 8.2 million ) in venture capital to bring its products to market			0
professor @entity65 said the study showed ‘ with a high degree of confidence ’ that the device has an effect , although the results were variable			0
‘ for some people - not everyone - the effect is really profound , ’ he said			0
‘ within minutes , they ’re feeling significantly different in a way that is as powerful as anything else i could imagine short of a narcotic			0
’ professor @entity35 is also working on a device that uses ultrasound to affect the brain without surgery or drugs			0
this technique could affect deep areas of the brain , associated with emotions and motivation and will be able to target areas measuring millimetres across			0
he hopes that it could one day be used to treat psychiatric disorders and shed light on how the brain works			0
professor @entity35 will work with @entity105 , a professor of psychiatry and behavioural science at @entity108 to investigate how the gadget might treat depression , post-traumatic stress disorder and @entity112 ’s			0
the device currently consists of a set of electrodes connected to a phone			1
electrodes are attached to different parts of the head , depending on the desired effect			0

the skin is mildly shocked behind the ear for an energising effect and on the temple and the back of the next for the relaxing effect			1

device is currently a set of electrodes connected to a phone
it uses electricity to change a person *'s* mood and can produce a temporary energising effect , or a calm feeling similar to drinking a few pints of beer
co-founder of the start - up from @entity36 said the feelings differ from person to person and last for a varying *length* of time
it works by applying a barely imperceptible electrical current to the skin
skin is mildly shocked behind the ear for an energising effect and on the temple and the back of the next for the relaxing effect
