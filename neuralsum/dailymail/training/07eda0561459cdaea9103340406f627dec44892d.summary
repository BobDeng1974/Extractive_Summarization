' i knew i was in the wrong body , so it just felt wrong			1
' making the transition to a woman is the best decision i ever made - i wish i ’d done it sooner			2
' now , dressed in heels and and mini-dress and with long curly hair , it is hard to believe that @entity4 , was once a male model who worked for the likes of @entity19			1

' but the pretty red head had known since an early age that she ’d been born in the wrong body			1
@entity4 said : ' i think i was about seven when i realised i should have been born a girl			2

i ’d paint my toes as i knew it was the one thing i could do without people noticing			0

' everyone knew from fairly early on that i wanted to be a girl - i even announced it on @entity84 when i was 18			0
@entity4 says she is finally proud of the person that she has become and would like to do tv as well as model ' but everything finally fell into place about four years ago - i was in a relationship with a woman and i was finding it really difficult			1
' i knew i was n’t being true to myself , and i realised i was mentally ready to make the transition			0
@entity4 says even as a young child she felt she was in the wrong body ' i was nervous about people ’s reactions - especially from people in the industry - but everyone ’s been really supportive			1
