by @entity0 follow @ @ draper_rob some will take to @entity1 to fill in the down time			2
others will be downloading tv hits such as @entity5 and @entity6			0
and their manager , well known for his literary tastes , will in all likelihood curl up with a @entity11 or @entity12 novel			2
but however @entity15 ’s 23 players choose to pass the time between training and performing at the @entity17 in @entity18 next month , manager @entity13 says he is not expecting to hear complaints from his squad about boredom or homesickness			1
with 29 days to go until the squad depart for their @entity25 training base before moving on to @entity27 , and with the @entity15 squad to be announced on monday week , @entity13 has sent the clearest message yet regarding the attitude and behaviour he expects from his team in @entity18			1
despite the fact that the previous campaign in @entity48 was marred by grumbles about the remote training ground in @entity51 , where players had little to do , @entity13 will have no sympathy for any squad members who suggest they are unhappy			1
that is partly because @entity15 have reversed their policy of using secluded training bases and are staying in the beachside @entity60 in @entity27 and training at @entity62 , beneath the landmark @entity64			1
principally , though , it is because @entity13 does not buy into the idea that players can not cope with long periods of enforced inactivity between training and games			1
‘ it ’s a complete nonsense , ’ said @entity13			1
‘ it ’s one of those silly excuses that people use			0
you really can not have that attitude			0
‘ i do n’t think it ’s our job to keep the players occupied			2
i think when you sign up for the @entity17 you sign up for the @entity17 as it ’s going to be			2
not bad for some : @entity15 's @entity83 hotel has spectacular views of @entity64 broadening horizons : @entity15 players visited @entity88 's factory museum during @entity89 in @entity90 / @entity91 1 does he go with 107 - cap @entity93 ( below , right ) or the youthful verve of @entity95 , 19 ( right ) , voted the best left - back in the country ? 2 with @entity98 out , does @entity13 bring in @entity99 or @entity100 as back - up for @entity102 — or take seven defenders and trust @entity104 or @entity106 to step in ? 3 could @entity107 squeeze in after an impressive few months at @entity108 ? 4 in midfield , does @entity13 go for @entity110 to steady the ship or @entity112 to add to his attacking options ? 5 up front , does he pick @entity115 — if only for the fact he has never missed a penalty — or give @entity118 , now with @entity119 , one last hurrah ? ‘ you know from may 19 , hopefully through to the final , you ’re going to be away , you ’ll be with another group of players and maybe there will be only one training session a day , so there will be a lot of free time			1
‘ you ’re not going to be with your wife , you ’re going to see your kids			0
this is something you sign up for			0
and once you sign up for that , you should n’t then be saying : “ oh , i ’m missing my family ; oh i ’m bored			0
what can you do to help me ? ” because there ’s nothing we can do to help you			0
’ @entity15 have lurched between polar opposite approaches to the base camp in past @entity17 finals			1
in @entity143 2006 , they resembled a travelling circus , when wives and girlfriends took over @entity147 , with daily parties and regular contact with players making @entity15 a laughing stock to other nations			1
circus : the @entity15 wags came out in force during the 2006 @entity17 in @entity147 , @entity143 @entity156 : @entity15 players complained of boredom under @entity160 's strict regime in @entity48 2010 current @entity15 coach @entity161 was part of that squad and criticised the arrangements			1
in @entity48 , manager @entity160 picked one of the most remote training grounds possible in @entity51 , with all facilities on site , so there was no need or even any temptation to go off site — although for several players that proved too stifling and lacking in stimulation			1
at @entity89 under @entity13 , the @entity175 instigated a policy of staying in city - centre hotels and allowing players more freedom			1
squad members were regularly seen strolling through @entity181 and eating out at nearby restaurants			0
in @entity27 , as well as the usual array of @entity1 games , table tennis , pool and tv downloads , players will be allowed to unwind over a round of golf on the 18 - hole course adjacent to their @entity83 base			1
‘ we ’ll put on the same as every other team , ’ said @entity13			2
right on course : a round of golf is likely to be a popular pastime among players in @entity18 ‘ there will be leisure activities , they ’ll get free time in the afternoon			1
if they want to have a game of golf , listen to their music or watch a video on tv , they can			0
‘ but what we ca n’t reproduce is that you go to training in the morning and then you go home to your wife and family and do whatever you want to do for the rest of the day			0
so i ’ve got no truck with that whatsoever			0
‘ if i got the 30 players together and told them , “ @entity226 , we ’re going to be living together , we ’re not going to be training every minute of the day , there ’ll be free time and you ’ve got to find a way of using that free time			2
out of you 30 here , put your hands up if you do n’t fancy that ? ” — there would n’t be one			0
get on with it ! the @entity15 manager argues that players must have boredom to deal with in everyday life ‘ they ’re all going to say , “ yeah , we understand that , we want to go			1
it ’s been my dream			0
all my life i ’ve dreamed it ”			0
‘ unfortunately , no one will say that in advance , and then some of them will go to the @entity17 and play badly and say to you guys , “ i was bored ”			2
and you ’ll write , “ poor fella ”			0
‘ it ’s like a soldier signing up for the army , then saying , “ i ’m a bit bored sitting around these barracks every day with nothing to do ”			0
they must have plenty of boredom in their lives but they cope with it			2

@entity13 does n't expect @entity15 players to complain of boredom
@entity15 will be based at a beachside hotel in @entity27 , @entity18
@entity267 *moaned* about @entity160 's secluded regime at @entity17 2010
the @entity15 manager sees boredom as ' an excuse '
