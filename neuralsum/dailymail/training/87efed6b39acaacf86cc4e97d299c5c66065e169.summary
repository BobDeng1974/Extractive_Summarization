a couple of @entity2 men , who were desperate to move a fridge despite lacking ropes , were caught taking the saying ' when there 's a will , there 's a way ' just one step too far			1
one sure - footed @entity12 man was seen perching atop a black @entity13 over the weekend while holding a large fridge in place on the roof of the vehicle			1
