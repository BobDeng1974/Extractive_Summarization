it 's a photograph that captures a collision of worlds ; in the foreground is one of the @entity6 's richest society heiresses and , on the table behind her , three of the most famous people on the planet - @entity9 , @entity11 and their daughter @entity13			1
whether @entity14 , the @entity15 heiress to the @entity17 farm equipment dynasty , was aware of exactly who was photobombing her image when she smiled next to her baby daughter is anyone 's guess			1
the social media moment was taken outside @entity24 , @entity27 's favourite a-list @entity26 restaurant , close to where @entity28 owns an organic farm and restaurant			1
sir @entity51 's net worth has been estimated at over £ 2.8billion by @entity56			1
the family is also behind the popular @entity59 food brand			0
@entity28 is no stranger to @entity48 having dabbled in @entity27 when she co-produced @entity62 's modern classic @entity61			0
she was also formerly a show - jumper , and previously owned her own record label in the early 2000s			0
more recently , she has run an organic farm and restaurant , one @entity69 , in @entity41			1
completely unaware that one of the world 's most famous families were going to be caught in her family snap , @entity28 can be seen with a wide smile , even slightly distracted by the view behind			0
when caught off guard by @entity28 at the high - profile establishment , @entity11 's famous family did n't appear to be quite the picture of domesticated bliss that the reality tv star would like you to believe			1
while the @entity85 personality may be no stranger to a selfie , it wo n't be the type of flattering snap that she 's used to as she was pictured reaching down to pick something up from the floor			0
@entity14 , pictured with her mother @entity52 , is heiress to a vast fortune @entity14 might not compare to the @entity95 family in terms of global fame but the @entity17 heiress has certainly led a fascinating life			1
the 39 - year - old is the daughter of billionaire sir @entity51 and his wife , @entity52 , @entity53			0
sir @entity51 's net worth has been estimated at over £ 2.8billion by @entity56			1
the family is also behind the popular @entity59 food brand , the namesake of the farm in @entity108 where @entity28 grew up			2
@entity28 is no stranger to @entity48 having dabbled in @entity27 when she co-produced @entity62 's modern classic @entity61			0
she was also formerly a show - jumper , and previously owned her own record label in the early 2000s			0
more recent ventures include one @entity115 , which @entity28 purchased in 2010			0
the @entity41 farm and restaurant supplies bio dynamic organic produce using ' compost - improved soil '			1
it also offers tours to @entity48 ' inner - city children			0
a fatigued @entity11 was in full mummy mode as @entity13 wriggled around in her high chair at the table			1
meanwhile @entity9 , looked transfixed by the mum - of - one appearing to grimace as he watched his wife reach under the table with a stern look on her face			2
after all , 37 - year - old rapper @entity9 had spent the afternoon pandering to their toddler as they played on the sands in @entity41			1
@entity9 was beach - ready in a sleeveless vest - albeit in black - with practical trainers while @entity138 looked cute in a pair of denim shorts and a white vest			2
most of @entity11 's most intimate moments from the last seven years - from her pregnancy to her 2013 divorce - have been documented on her @entity143 reality show with sisters @entity150 , @entity151 , @entity152 and @entity153 , as well as mother and manager @entity155 and step father @entity149			2
@entity11 is usually partial to a few photograph filters to brighten or smooth her skin and has even been accused of using @entity158 to alter the appearance of her famous figure in the pictures she 's posted			2
but this particular moment was perhaps the most candid of them all when she and her husband of one year were captured in their most raw form			0
polished as always , @entity11 was arguably unsuitably dressed for a day on the sand on sunday			2
she had dressed up in her strappy sandals and a military green midi dress , which clung to her famous curves , deciding to watch her daddy and daughter duo from the restaurant , outside her car			0
her hair was looking slightly frazzled after treating it to a third dye job this week to keep the platinum shade from revealing her brunette roots			0
she had her hair , which she has referred to as a ' full - time job ' recently , pulled back into a low - fuss ponytail at the nape of her neck			0
and as if styled for a red carpet appearance , @entity11 was carrying a snakeskin clutch bag in her hands , which was far from a traditional baby bag used to tote everything a 21 - month - old might need for a day at the beach			1
@entity11 may be a style icon to some , but her younger half sister @entity193 has admitted that @entity138 is actually her main source of fashion inspiration			2
speaking to @entity199 ! magazine recently , the youngest of the @entity193 family said of her icons : ' to keep it in the family , i love @entity11 and @entity9 ’s style			1
' they definitely inspire me			0
@entity13 probably inspires me the most			0
@entity11 and @entity9 – i ’m obsessed with their style ! @entity11 ’s always in the latest stuff , so i always look to her for advice			1
@entity9 and @entity11 seemed unaware that they 'd been caught in someone else 's photo adorable : @entity9 acted like the doting dad as he spent time by the sea with @entity138 on sunday afternoon mum mobile : @entity11 was seen in her car in @entity218 on monday and appeared to be chatting on her phone as she sat at the wheel busy bee : the mum of one was recognisable just by her peroxide locks as she peeped over the steering wheel			1

@entity14 is heiress to the @entity17 farm equipment fortune
the family is said to be worth £ 2.8billion and also own @entity231
@entity9 , @entity11 and baby @entity13 were dining in @entity24 in @entity41
