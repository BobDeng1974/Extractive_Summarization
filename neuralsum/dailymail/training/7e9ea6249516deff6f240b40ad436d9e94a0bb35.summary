’ @entity102 is a fault in the development of the spine and spinal cord which leaves a gap in the spine			0
it occurs when something goes wrong during the first month of an embryo 's development meaning the spinal column does n't close fully			0
exactly why this happens is not known but the most significant risk factor that has been identified is a lack of folic acid before pregnancy and in the very early weeks of pregnancy			0
symptoms of the condition include learning difficulties , paralysis of the lower limbs and incontinence			0
@entity125 is the least serious type of spina bifida and causes just a very small opening in the spine			0
this opening tends to be covered with skin so the gap is not visible externally , as it can be with other forms of spina bifida			0
however , this skin often contains a hairy patch or a birth mark			1
it usually does not cause any symptoms meaning most people are unaware they have the condition			0
@entity102 affects about one child in every 2,500			0
source : @entity143 mr @entity10 ’s tail is a result of the birth defect @entity102 , which can result in lower - back growths or , as in mr @entity10 ’s case , a tuft of hair , which can grow into a tail if left uncut			1
@entity102 occurs when the spinal column does not close all of the way down – it is one of the most common permanently disabling birth defects			2
it is highly likely that mr @entity10 was born with a form of spina bifida called spina bifida occulta			1
a spokesperson for @entity160 , a spina bifida charity , told @entity162 that it is quite common for children with spina bifida to have a hairy patch on their back			2
mr @entity10 's uncle , @entity170 , said : ‘ with age , his tail has also been growing longer			1
so , we realised very early that he has the blessings of @entity69			0
’ despite having found fame as a revered @entity174 , mr @entity10 admits it was n't always easy			1
he said : ‘ when i was young , kids in the village used to make fun of me and my tail			2
' they used to laugh			0
they used to pull my tail just for fun			2
’ and he revealed that his tail was also a turn - off for the ladies - with his family saying over 20 women rejected his romantic advances before he met wife @entity189 , 38			1
he said : ‘ a few women rejected my proposals			0
i had gone to see a girl once			0
she immediately noticed that i have a tail			2
' she refused to marry me there and then			0
she said to my face it was because of my tail			2
’ mr @entity10 married @entity189 , 38 , in 2007 , before the couple had a daughter , five - year - old @entity199			1
