@entity1 's boss recently admitted the social network ' sucks ' at dealing with trolls and now the site is making good on its promise to clamp down on these abusive accounts			1
reports from @entity8 claim the site will start banning users who violate its rules by tracking email addresses and phone numbers			1
this means that if an offender attempts to sign up for other accounts using these details @entity1 will be able to intervene			1
reports claim @entity1 will start banning trolls and abusive users by tracking email addresses and phone numbers			1
when people sign up they are required to give an email address , but adding a number ( pictured ) is optional			0
to solve this issue , @entity1 may ban accounts accused of abuse until they provide a phone number when people sign up to @entity1 they are required to provide an email address , which is then validated			1
adding a phone number is an optional step and is predominantly used if people want to receive text notifications or setup two - step verification			0
under the reported plans , once a user is banned these email addresses and phone numbers will be stored and cross-referenced each time a new user signs up to the site			1
it is not known how this information will be stored and how specifically it will be used and @entity42 has contacted @entity1 for more information			0
stories of abuse , threats and internet trolls have become commonplace on @entity1 in recent years			1
@entity49 ’ daughter , @entity48 , left the social platform last year after being sent disturbing images in the wake of her father ’s suicide			0
feminist critic @entity55 was threatened with rape , sexual violence and death by @entity1 trolls during the ' @entity61 ' saga after she criticised the way women are portrayed in video games			2
in the @entity66 , journalist @entity65 also received rape threats after she voiced her support for the campaign to introduce @entity70 as the new face of the £ 10 note			0
@entity1 users @entity73 and @entity75 admitted sending the messages to ms @entity65 and both were jailed last year			2
although this is a positive step , the system is unlikely to catch trolls if they sign up for accounts with multiple email addresses			1
similarly , as adding a phone number is optional , this wo n't always be possible to track			0
but the @entity8 continued @entity1 may temporarily ban accounts accused of abuse until they provide a phone number to get round this issue			1
earlier this month , an internal memo sent by @entity1 's chief executive @entity89 revealed the 51 - year - old thinks his site ‘ sucks at dealing with abuse and trolls ’			1
in the memo , mr @entity89 said he is embarrassed by the way the company handles abuse and that it must take stronger action in the future			1
mr @entity89 ’s comments were posted on an internal forum among @entity1 employees , after one employee raised the question of what more could be done to tackle online abuse			1
in december , a blog post titled ' building a safer @entity1 ' revealed @entity1 is working on ways to make it easier to block and report abuse			1
the site has since improved the reporting process to make it more mobile - friendly , and it now requires less initial information			0

more recently the site posted a follow - up blog updating users on its new safety features			2
@entity42 has contacted @entity1 for more information about how users details will be stored under the @entity136 1988 , any ' indecent or grossly offensive ' message that causes ' distress or anxiety ' to the recipient can lead to prosecution			1
the maximum punishment is a fine not exceeding level four on the standard scale - i.e. no more than £ 2,500			0
since the 1988 law came into force before the widespread use of the internet , e-mail and social networking , prosecutors have used a number of different laws to charge @entity1 trolls			2
student @entity156 , who sent a series of racially abusive tweets after footballer @entity159 collapsed , was charged under the @entity160			0
two men jailed for inciting riots last summer were found guilty under the @entity163 , and @entity164 , who joked he would blow @entity166 airport ' sky high ' was charged under the @entity168			0

more recently , the site posted a follow - up blog updating users on its new safety features			2
@entity182 , @entity1 's vice president of @entity183 said : ' over the last six months , in addition to the product changes , we have overhauled how we review user reports about abuse			1
' overall , we now review five times as many user reports as we did previously , and we have tripled the size of the support team focused on handling abuse reports			0
' we are also beginning to add several new enforcement actions for use against accounts that violate our rules			2
these new actions will not be visible to the vast majority of rule - abiding @entity1 users - but they give us new options for acting against the accounts that do n’t follow the rules and serve to discourage behavior that goes against our policies			1
the safety of our users is extremely important to us			0
it ’s something we continue to work hard to improve			0
' in recent years @entity1 has come under fire for failing to protect its users from trolls			2
@entity49 ’ daughter , @entity48 , left the social platform last year after being sent disturbing images in the wake of her father ’s death			0
she made an appeal to her followers to report two users on @entity1 ( shown above )			0

reports claim @entity1 will start banning users who violate its rules
it will then add these user 's addresses and phone numbers to a *blacklist*
this means if an offender attempts to sign up for other accounts using these details @entity1 will be able to intervene
@entity1 boss @entity89 recently said site ' sucks ' at dealing with trolls
in an internal memo he also took *responsibility* for @entity1 's *problems*
