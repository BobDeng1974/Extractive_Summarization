the world is eagerly awaiting sharper images of @entity2 after @entity3 went into orbit around the comet last week			1
but one image has already caused excitement among space enthusiasts after the outline of a human face was spotted on the edge of the icy comet			1
the @entity14 's youth portal , @entity15 , spotted the optical illusion and pointed it out on @entity17 last week			1
the @entity14 's youth portal , @entity15 , first spotted the face seeing faces in unusual and random objects is nothing new			1
the phenomenon is called @entity32 is the psychological response to seeing faces and other significant and everyday items in random stimulus			1
it is a form of @entity38 , which is when people see patterns or connections in random , unconnected data			0
human eyes can spot faces within their environment and it helps them recognise friends in a crowd , work out how fast a car is travelling , and see patterns			0
click on the image below to view @entity3 's current position @entity51 by @entity3 's @entity53 narrow - angle camera on 3 august from a distance of 285 km. the image resolution is 5.3 metres / pixel close up detail focusing on a smooth region on the ' base ' of the ' body ' section of comet @entity2			1
the image was taken by @entity3 's @entity53 narrow - angle camera and downloaded today scientists claim we also tend to use this ability to ' enrich our imagination ' and recognise meaningful shapes , even when they 're not there			2
for instance , the @entity73 1 @entity72 orbiter in 1976 sparked infamous claims of a ' face on @entity72			1
' in 1976 @entity76 sent two spacecraft called @entity73 1 and @entity78 to the @entity80 region of @entity72			1
both spacecraft took images of the planet 's surface and beamed them back to @entity76 scientists on @entity86			0
one image , taken on 25 july 1976 by @entity73 , showed what appeared to be a face in the rocks			1
this ' face on @entity72 ' image was taken about half - way between the @entity94 and @entity95 in @entity80			1
when the image was seen by @entity73 chief scientist @entity98 , he dismissed it as a ' trick of light and shadow '			2
but another image taken at a different angle also appeared to show a face in the planet 's surface , and was found by @entity106 and @entity107 , two computer engineers at @entity76			2
this ' face on @entity72 ' image was taken about half - way between the @entity94 and @entity95 in @entity80			2
when the image was seen by @entity73 chief scientist @entity98 , he dismissed it as a ' trick of light and shadow '			2
@entity3 is currently in orbit within 62 miles ( 100km ) of comet @entity2 which is travelling at 34,000 mph ( 55,000 km per hour )			1
described as ' the sexiest , most fantastic mission ever ' , the probe will spend more than a year analysing the comet to help uncover the secrets to life on @entity86			0
as well as the ' alien face , ' there are already a number of fascinating features shown on recent images by the probe			0
' i was impressed that on the neck that connects the two parts of the comet there is something like the side of a mountain , ' mission director , @entity134 , told @entity135			0
' it 's like looking at the @entity137 on a very high wall			0
it makes you feel like you want to climb it			0
' and on one of the few areas that seem to be flat there are boulders 20 to 30 metres wide , they look like houses			0
' they are there in complete isolation			0
in the coming days we can say more about what these features are			0
' images of comet @entity2 taken on july 14 , 2014 , by the @entity53 imaging system aboard the @entity3 spacecraft have allowed scientists to create this three - dimensional shape model of the nucleus a timeline of @entity3 's journey to comet @entity163			1
the probe was launched in march 2004 from @entity165 in @entity166			0
in january this year , after three years , @entity3 woke up from hibernation to chase down its comet images reveal close - up details of the comet , which scientists hope to better explain in the coming months			2
@entity174 's ' head ' is at the left of the frame , which is casting shadow onto the ' neck ' and ' body ' to the right			0

face was spotted by the @entity14 and posted on @entity17
it is an example of a common psychological response known as @entity32
this illusion is caused when a vague object is seen as something *distinct*
for instance , @entity73 1 @entity72 sparked infamous claims of a ' face on @entity72 '
@entity3 went into in orbit within 62 miles ( 100km ) of comet @entity2 last week
