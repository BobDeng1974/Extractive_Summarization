our men shouted back " all right "			0

' a @entity33 looked over the trench - no shots - our men did the same , and then a few of our men went out and brought the dead in ( 69 ) and buried them and the next thing happened a football kicked out of our trenches and @entity33 and @entity76 played football			1
