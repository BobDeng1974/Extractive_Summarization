by @entity0 these are the first behind - the - scenes pictures of @entity2 being re-created 37 years on - as the animated star returns to our screens tomorrow			1
animators at @entity7 in @entity8 have spent five months creating 15 episodes using 150 clay models			2
remarkably , the team have used the original ‘ morph scales ’ which ensure each model contains exactly 162g of clay to create the perfect figurine			0
in truly modern fashion , the comeback was made possible by a crowdfunding campaign which raised £ 110,000 from 2,500 fans in a month to fund the new animations			0
@entity2 was first created in 1977 at the hands of @entity20 , and was famed for its clever use of plasticine stop motion animation			2
this method involved moving the model in small increments between individually photographed frames , creating the appearance of movement when the frames were played back - to - back at high speed			2
@entity2 first hit tv screens in 1977 and appeared in one minute ' shorts ' interspersed throughout children 's tv shows presented by @entity54			1
the character was known for living in a box , and was later joined by a white - coloured friend called @entity58 , allowing the two to interact			0
they often changed shape completely , and could be rolled , squished or bent into various shapes			0
while the original show was axed in 1997 , there were several small @entity2 scenes created over following years before mr @entity20 's recent kickstarter campaign funded a whole new series			1
mr @entity20 and the creators also went on to find fame for their @entity69 winning @entity72 films and tv series			0
the series has been produced using the same traditional animation techniques used in the original series , which was axed in 1997			0
the films were shot in the same studio as the original programmes with the same painstaking stop - frame animation and hand sculpting tools			0
co-founder of @entity7 , @entity20 : ' morph is one of the first characters we created and we all love him at @entity7 ! ' i ’m amazed and humbled that even though it has been close to 40 years since his creation , the little guy still has such a passionate following , especially on @entity90 and @entity30			1
' we ’ve had so many people over the years asking for him to make a comeback and it ’s been hugely exciting to work with his fans to bring @entity2 back in some brand new short films which we will release online for everyone to enjoy			1
' as well as @entity2 ’s new episodes , the character will also be used to introduce the programme ‘ @entity102 ’ , a show created with deaf or visibly impaired children in mind			1
there was an issue as to whether @entity2 was up to the task , as although he has a thumb , his fingers are merged together , limiting the amount he can sign			2
luckily he can sign ' hello and welcome to see hear ' , so will introduce the show on wednesday 18th june on @entity113			0
director @entity114 working on @entity2 - which returns to our screens 37 years after it first appeared @entity119 's new series was shot in the same studio and using the same method as the old episodes @entity20 created the new models using the original @entity2 scales to ensure each one weighs exactly 162g			1
