by @entity0 published : 05:12 est , 18 march 2014 updated : 05:12 est , 18 march 2014 climate change will wreak havoc on the world and its population , causing mass migration , malnutrition and war , according to a leaked official report			1
an official publication by the @entity12 's @entity11 ( @entity11 ) , which will be made public at the end of this month , paints a bleak picture of how global warming will affect the globe			1
the draft report , the second of three by the @entity11 , was written by hundreds of respected scientists and offers the most comprehensive look ever at the impact of climate change on the planet			1
a leaked @entity12 report warns climate change will mean more devastating floods , as happened in @entity25 in 2010 based on thousands of studies , the paper predicts that by the end of the 21st century , ' hundreds of millions of people will be affected by coastal flooding and displaced , due to land loss ' , it was reported today			1
it warns that such forced mass migration will lead to violent conflict , particularly in @entity35 , while the flooding will result in a two per cent drop in crop yields every decade for the rest of the century			0
as a result , the @entity12 report says , millions more children under the age of five will suffer from malnutrition , while people in many regions will be at greater risk of water - borne diseases , injury or death from flooding , heatwaves or fire			1
the global economy will suffer , too , with global gdp predicted to drop by $ 1.4trn ( Â£ 841billion ) as a result of rising temperatures			0
according to a report in the @entity61 , the report shows that the effect of this predicted climate change on @entity64 will be comparatively small , and will include rising food prices , worse air pollution leading to increased asthma and hay fever			2
also under threat are some of @entity71 and @entity73 's rare coastal habitats and peatlands , and @entity64 's grouse moors			0
the report , by the @entity11 's @entity77 , will be considered by the @entity11 in @entity78 , @entity79 , on 25 - 29 march			1
the first report came out last september , a third report , by @entity77 , will be published in the second week of april , and a final , sythesis report will be discussed in @entity83 in october this year			0
mass migration : flooding will force people to migrate , leading to violent conflict , the report says ( stock image ) by the end of the 21st century , ' hundreds of millions of people will be affected by coastal flooding and displaced , due to land loss ' , the report predicts			2
rising sea levels will mean coastal flooding , submergence and coastal emergence , it says , with the worst hit areas east @entity35 , south - east @entity35 , and south @entity35			0
existing health problems will be made worse by the changing climate until around 2050 , the report says , after which people will face the threat of injury , water - borne disease , and death from flooding , heatwaves and fire			1
flooding and heatwaves will lead to mass migration , a key cause in conflict			0
the report says increased poverty and decreasing food supplies will increase the likelihood of violent conflicts , as will migrating fish stocks from one country 's territory to another , and changes in water sources and sea ice			2
air pollution , as shown in @entity127 , @entity128 , will increase as a result of climate change , the @entity11 report says the @entity11 report suggests that a rise in average global temperature of @entity133 from pre-industrial levels may lead to a drastic drop in global gdp			2
even small increases of around @entity139 will mean a reduction in yields of maize , wheat and rice in tropical and temperate regions , the report warns , with an average reduction in yields of two per cent per decade for the rest of the century			0
meanwhile global demand is set to increase			0
coastal habitats in @entity71 and @entity73 , such as machair and peatlands , may be under threat from climate change , along with @entity64 grouse moors			2
the draft report says that ' freshwater - related risks of climate change increase significantly with increasing greenhouse gas emissions ' , and says competition for freshwater will increase as renewable ground water and surface water resources dwindle			1
rare habitats , such as this machair grassy plain in @entity167 , @entity168 , may be threatened , the report warns			0

draft report by @entity12 's @entity11 leaked
it is due to be published in @entity78 , @entity79 , at the end of this month
offers most comprehensive look yet at impact of climate change on planet
report paints a bleak picture of how the world may be affected in *future*
flooding , heat and migration will affect food stocks and provoke conflict
humans will be at risk of water - borne disease , injury and death , it says
