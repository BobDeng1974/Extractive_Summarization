by @entity0 @entity1 : 13:25 est , 26 december 2013 @entity2 : 15:19 est , 26 december 2013 with its white spiderweb design and 18 rotors humming gently , it looks like it was plucked straight from a science fiction book			0
this is the world 's first electric two - seater helicopter , which could soon be flying over your house after online investors raised £ 1 million in just three days			1
instead of a traditional combustion engine , it uses an battery pack on the back of the aircraft to power the 18 rotors arranged on top			1
since then they have raised £ 1m technology : when completed the @entity23 will be able to fly up to 6,500ft weighing not more than 450kg flight of fancy : although the maiden flight was unmanned , the inventors hope to get people on board soon its inventors say it will be the most environmentally - friendly helicopter ever created			1
they also claim it will be the world 's safest because it is unlikely to crash if a rotor fails			0
the design is so unusual that authorities in @entity49 , where it is being developed , have had to invent a new class of aircraft for it to get a license to fly			1
when the @entity54 is completed , it will be able to fly at 6,500ft for up to an hour weighing a maximum of 450kg including crew and kit , about half the weight of a @entity59			1
after the successful test flight last month , inventors @entity61 , @entity62 and @entity63 put out an online plea before @entity66 for money from internet investors			1
their ' crowdfunding ' attempt on the website seedmatch.de was so successful it smashed all records in @entity49 - earning them 500,000 euros in just two and a half hours			2
by the time they reached their total of 1.2 million euros ( £ 1m ) in three days , nine hours and 52 minutes , they had been handed money by 750 different investors ranging from 250 to 10,000 euros			1
engineering : the team in @entity81 has taken several years and millions of @entity82 to advance the design this far success ! the inventors sit inside their creation , with one wearing a t - shirt bearing the craft 's odd design coming to @entity91 ? anyone with a pilot 's license can fly the craft , which is being primed for mass production mr @entity62 , the managing director of @entity97 , the firm behind the aircraft , said : ' there are already numerous requests for the @entity23 from around the world			1
' the money raised will now serve to optimize the first prototype of the @entity104 and , as part of the testing scheme , conclude a comprehensive test flight program for this new aviation category			1
' after that , we will build a weight - optimized prototype of the @entity104 [ to prepare for mass production ]			0
' with multiple flights lasting several minutes reaching the nearly 22m [ 72ft ] high ceiling , including a number of smooth takeoffs and landings , the @entity23 concept exceeded all expectations			0
' the result of the first flight created a euphoria among the entire project team			0
' the idea has been several years in the planning and previously won a 2 million @entity82 ( £ 1.7m ) grant from @entity49 's federal ministry of economics and technology			2
test flights were conducted in @entity81 , @entity49 , including of a 16 - rotor prototype last year with room for just one brave pilot			2
prototype : a test version of the helicopter last year had room for just one precariously - placed pilot for the test version , the @entity140 , the pilot had to sit in the open air on top of a metal ball containing the batteries soaring success : the @entity23 's inventors celebrate after their prototype made its maiden flight weighing just 80kg including the batteries , it was so small that the helmet - wearing pilot had to sit in the open air between the blades strapped into a tiny chair			0
anyone with a private pilot 's licence in @entity49 will be able to fly the revolutionary aircraft once it hits the mass market			2
its inventors claim it is also simpler to fly than a traditional helicopter , with just one joystick controlling almost every aspect of flight			0
the project has been handed a provisional airworthiness certificate and its inventors hope it will get the sign - off from aviation authorities in the near future			0
a statement by the firm said : ' the @entity23 is an absolutely novel aircraft which can not be assigned to any existing aviation category			0
' the greatest challenge after technical realisation is to be able to place such an aircraft on the market			0

*otherworldly* design uses a battery pack instead of a combustion engine
inventors raised £ 1m in just three days after test flight last month
when finished it will weigh half of a @entity59 and fly up to 6,500ft
it is so unusual that @entity49 officials had to invent a new class of aircraft
