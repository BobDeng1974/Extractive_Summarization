it has been described by guests as a night spent living like the @entity2			1
but the owners of this @entity4 were actually emulating the @entity5 - not the @entity6 - when they built an elaborate thatched hut , complete with open log fire , for adventurous guests			2
ambitious farmer , @entity10 , 49 , has hand - built a primitive wooden roundhouse in @entity12 , which comes complete with a six - ton thatched roof to protect guests from rain			1
food is available on arrival , if requested , and candles are on offer for lights pop the kettle on ! take advantage of the fire , or get a meal cooked for you upon your arrival by the hosts			0
the hut is designed to allow ventilation when the smoky fire is lit forget electricity , the only luxuries you will experience are candles , an open stone hearth fire , a single cold tap and a composting toilet			2
mr @entity10 had dreamt of creating the b&b since he was a teenager , after watching a @entity50 documentary of a small community recreating an @entity5 settlement			1
he made the decision to make his dreams a reality and created @entity17 using materials found purely on his farm			0
the project was a family venture , with mr @entity10 , his wife @entity61 , 42 , and their children @entity60 , 23 , @entity63 , 21 , may , 18 , and @entity64 , 14 , spending six months and a total of 2,500 hours manpower to create the dwelling			2
they helped to construct the walls from from a sand and lime mixture , and even now it is completed , @entity61 and @entity63 help out with running its everyday bookings			0
he said : ' you have in the back of your head a little dream that is there all through your life			0
' we are farmers and we were looking at ways to try and diversify what we do and lots of farms have converted barns but we wanted to try something completely different			0
' we thought it can not be that hard but my grief , you would n't believe the work			0
' if we had known in the first place we probably would n't have started it but the roundhouse turned out far better than we thought			0
' the hut is 30 metres in diametre , with a six ton roof made out of 14in thick water reed thatch			0
the walls were made by mr @entity10 and his son @entity101 , 25 , who trained with the @entity102 and featured on @entity104 's @entity103 @entity105 essentials ! switch off from the busy world , and enjoy a simple night stay in @entity12 - but do n't expect a luxurious experience ! all the furniture in the roundhouse was made from mr @entity10 's 214 - acre farm			1
all members of the family helped out on the project , which had been mr @entity10 's dream since he had been a teenager although it is a @entity5 roundhouse , many guests have said they felt it is similar to @entity118 and @entity120 's home in the 1960s cartoon , the @entity2 the hut took mr @entity10 , his wife @entity61 , 42 , and their children @entity101 , 23 , @entity63 , 21 , may , 18 , and @entity64 , 14 , six months to build , which is a total of 2,500 man hours historic roots ! allegedly the land which the roundhouse sits on today was home to the @entity131 people who inhabited the area from at least the @entity5 up to the early @entity134 period mr @entity10 admitted feeling anxious that the wooden structure would fill up with smoke from the fire			1
the father of four said : ' the terrifying thing about it was we were not sure that the whole idea would work at all because the fire may have smoked the place out , we had to build the whole thing before we could try it out - thank heaven our fears were unfounded			0
' the house sleeps two to ten guests and @entity2 wannabes will be relieved knowing the farm can provide meals if they do not wish to try their chances on the stove			2
although guests will be experiencing primitive living , it will set them back £ 170 a night to experience life as a @entity159 resident			1
bookings can be made through the @entity162 website or from the owners at @entity164			0
inspiration for the home came from a fly on the wall documentary called @entity168 on the @entity50 in 1978 , where a small community recreated an @entity5 settlement a fear the family had in recreating their homes was ventilation and there were concerns the smoke from the fire would fill the roundhouse , thankfully the smoke passes through the thatch , allowing meals to be cooked on the hearth the painstaking reconstruction of an @entity5 roundhouse was achieved by @entity10 in the heart of the @entity12 countryside the whole family helped out , including daughter @entity63 , ( left )			1
the @entity10 's cobbled the doorway , ( right ) , to create an attractive welcome to the property release your inner @entity2 in the roundhouse , which sleeps two to ten guests , and can be booked for £ 170 through the @entity162 website @entity198 style			1
animal skins are optional for a snug night in the wooden retreat			1
mr @entity10 wanted to turn back the clock for guests the six ton roof was created with 28ft long timbers from surrounding woodland and a thatcher put in the 14inch thick water reed thatch daughter @entity63 did sketches of what the hut could look like , ( left ) , which look remarkably similar to the end product , which is now accepting bookings for hotel guests , ( right )			2

since he was a teenager , @entity10 dreamt of turning back the clock to create an *authentic* roundhouse
animal skins and candles are provided in the primitive @entity221 in the heart of @entity12
despite being of an @entity5 design , guests have described the experience as like a night in a @entity2 *episode*
