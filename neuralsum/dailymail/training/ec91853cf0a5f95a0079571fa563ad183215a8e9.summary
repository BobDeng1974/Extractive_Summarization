how about this for a slice of good fortune ? when a woman forgot to pack her dinner she managed to avoid going hungry by dialing out for pizza			2
while there is nothing unusual in that , what made this takeaway particularly unique was the fact peckish passenger @entity12 was partway through a four - hour train journey to @entity15 when she picked up the phone			1
and after two knock - backs , she finally managed to track down a pizza firm willing to rise to the challenge			2
she said : ' we never thought it would work , but we needed some dinner			2
the train set off at 5.50pm and was n't getting in until 10.30pm			1
' i asked the train conductor when we were getting in at each station , then started calling all the pizza places on the way			0
' two said ' no ' , but @entity41 at @entity42 in @entity43 loved the idea			0
i said to him " i 've got a mission for you " and he got very excited			0
' there was just a 50 second window for @entity41 to deliver the piping hot pizza to the @entity50 set designer when their two - carriage train - which did not have a buffet car or a trolley - pulled in to @entity43 station			1
military precision : lucie gets ready to make the leap onto the platform at @entity43 station where her pizzas are waiting for her that 's service : pizza hut delivery man @entity63 hands over the goods to @entity57 during the 50 - second stop as the train pulled in at 6.54pm , @entity41 was waiting for her with her dinner - one deep pan pepperoni pizza , one thin - crust chicken and mushroom , plus barbecue chicken wings and a side of garlic and herb dip			1
she had handed over the ' dough ' earlier when she placed the order by telephone			1
it set the trio back just over Â£ 35 , and to cap it all was delivered in exactly 30 minutes - normally the average wait for a pizza delivery is 40 minutes			1
ms @entity12 jumped onto the platform , grabbed the goodies , and was back in her seat in less than 50 seconds ready to tuck into her teatime treat			1
she said : ' there were so many ways it could have gone wrong			0
we paid over the phone so @entity41 could have taken the money and not come			2
timing : lucie achieves the handover in the 50 second allotted time frame , while @entity41 waves goodbye food on the go : @entity57 's food was delivered an hour into her four - and - a - half - hour journey ' i do n't know how he got on the station - we offered to pay for a ticket for him , but he did n't need it			1
' but when he was there the whole station was cheering			0
by the time i got to @entity15 all my friends were texting me saying i was on the front page of @entity113			0
' i do n't even know how i got there but everyone was posting it and commenting on it			0
i just ca n't believe we managed it			0
' after posting pictures of their dinner on @entity125 , ms @entity12 and her friends became an online hit			1
general manager of @entity128 , @entity129 , said : ' when we got a call from a customer to deliver pizza to the @entity28 to @entity15 train we simply could n't resist the challenge			2
' the train was held at @entity43 station , which is in our delivery area , for less than a minute but our delivery driver got the pizzas to the train hot and bang on time			1
' back on board : @entity57 proudly shows off the fruits of her labour			0
two pizza firms had turned her down before @entity42 agreed to her request			0

@entity12 avoids going hungry on the 5.50pm from @entity28
the set designer ordered two pizzas to be delivered during a brief stop
she handed over the ' dough ' earlier when she placed the order by phone
the delivery man even delivered quicker than the 40 - minute average wait
