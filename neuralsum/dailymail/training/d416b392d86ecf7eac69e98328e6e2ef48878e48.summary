@entity1 ’s premature death may not have been caused by his lifestyle alone , but brought on by an undiagnosed genetic condition , a new documentary claims			1
after tracking down a sample of @entity1 ’ hair and analysing its dna , scientists found evidence that the singer was genetically prone to migranes , obesity and heart disease			1
the @entity15 documentary series , which also investigates relics said to hail from famous and infamous names such as @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20 , sheds new light on the death of the @entity23			0
new evidence : an analysis of the a sample of what is claimed to be @entity1 ' hair , scientists have found that he was genetically prone to heart muscle disease as well as obesity , glaucoma and migranes in his later years , @entity1 became addicted to junk - food and prescription drugs , which resulted in the former sex symbol becoming hugely overweight , and he died of cardiac arrhythmia at his home @entity40 , in @entity41 on august 16 , 1977 , aged 42			1
he was also known to have suffered from headaches and bad eyesight , however all of these things may have been in his genes			0
in the first episode of @entity49 , presenter @entity47 tracks down a sample of @entity1 ’ hair from a friend of his barber			2
@entity54 claims barber @entity55 captured hair falling from @entity1 ’ head in a towel placed on his shoulders during his regular trims , and has since stored the hair in a bank vault			2
after analysing @entity1 ’s dna , scientists found a gene mutation known to cause hypertrophic cardiomyopathy – a heart muscle disease that usually occurs in men between the ages of 20 and 40 , causing which causes the thickening of the heart and weakening of the heart muscle			1
death of a @entity23 : @entity1 , pictured in 1977 , performing in one of his last concerts , was addicted to junkfood and prescription drugs in the latter years of his life and died of a heart attack in his home @entity40 professor @entity81 who extracted @entity1 ’ dna from the hair said it was the best genome he has done			1
‘ this genome of a dead person who has died a long time ago is the best genome we have ever done , ’ the professor of biochemistry and @entity86 , @entity84 said			0
‘ in fact we can actually decipher nearly 90 per cent of his genome … this is the blueprint of genetic information of what makes a person			0
’ after extracting the genome , the dna sample was sent to medical geneticists in @entity99 who found several mutations in @entity1 ’ dna			1
mutations , known as ‘ variants ’ can both benefit and harm , and in @entity1 ’ case the combination of his ‘ variants ’ may have been fatal			2
‘ @entity1 and his doctor have both been blamed over the years for his premature death , and it was thought his overeating or overdosing on drugs had killed him ’ , presenter @entity47 says			0
‘ whilst those addictions would not have helped , this new evidence suggests @entity1 may have had a flaw in his dna and his early death was his genetic destiny			1
’ @entity119 : @entity1 , pictured in his prime in 1958 , carried a gene mutation known to cause hypertrophic cardiomyopathy , a heart muscle disease , which may have remained undiagnosed the analysis , carried out by dr @entity125 , director of the centre for @entity127 at @entity128 in @entity129 found four major chromosome mutations			1
as well as mutations known to cause migranes and glaucoma , two issues which were known to have blighted the junkfood - addicted @entity1 ’ life in his later years , they also found evidence that he was genetically prone to obesity			1
@entity1 , a junk food addict who relied heavily on prescription drugs , was known to have suffered from headaches , bad eyesight and ballooned in weight towards the end of his life			0
most importantly however was a mutation on @entity148 which is known to cause hypertrophic cardiomyopathy			0
@entity1 displayed many of the symptoms of this disease towards the end of his life including – irregular heartbeat , fatigue , fainting , high blood pressure			0
dr @entity125 said : ‘ we know that @entity1 had a strong family history of heart failure , and we know that he died suddenly , and at autopsy his heart was indeed thickened , which is another word for cardiomyopathy of a particular type			2
so this was a very good fit with @entity1 ’ clinical picture			0
‘ there had been so much speculation about cause of death , and so much ill spoken of his lifestyle , and we had this intriguing finding that possibly @entity1 actually had a medical illness , and all of the stuff about how he killed himself with his lifestyle might have been very unfair			0

@entity1 died of a heart attack in august 1977 , aged 42
dna from his hair offers new theory as to the cause of his death
scientists found that he was genetically prone to heart muscle disease
analysis also found ' mutations ' causing obesity , glaucoma and *migraines*
