by @entity0 published : 22:32 est , 19 november 2013 updated : 03:18 est , 20 november 2013 it showed a disappearing feature of the @entity6 landscape - and even included ' glamour ' spots of @entity7			2
but it would appear that even with that enticing sell , the ' @entity9 ' failed to lure in buyers			2
the calendar has failed to sell a single copy - with just 41 days until the @entity14			2
and even the publisher admitted some people found it ' naff , nerdy and boring ' - but he hoped there was a specialist interest on old phone boxes			1
the allure of chipped phone boxes in the calendar has failed to draw in a single customer since it went on sale publisher @entity26 , 61 , was responsible for unlikely seasonal hit roundabouts of @entity28 2012 - and was hoping to repeat his success			1
but he admitted he might have misjudged their target market with his latest ' niche ' calender			1
the @entity9 2014 - priced at £ 9.99 - features 12 months of dilapidated boxes			2
but it has failed to shift a single copy since going on sale in september			2
the calender features phone boxes in @entity7 ' glamour spots ' including @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42			1
the iconic phone boxes - largely unused - sit in overgrown grass or crisp winter snow - one is in front of a graveyard			2
they have ' unique features ' including chipped paint , broken glass , graffiti and signings warning ' coins not accepted here ' even with the inclusion of ducks and graveyards featuring in the calendar , consumers have not been persuaded to part with £ 9.99 for the photographs in its advertising it says ; ' we must immediately seek out and record the most iconic phone boxes on the planet before they all become extinct			0
' government cuts , neglect , vandalism , lack of investment and mobile cell phones have all lead to the sad demise of these revered , scarlet solid structures of communication			0
' all of our lives they have been with us			0
' reassuring , comforting , well built , weather - proof , iconic , dependable , indestructible ... ... until now ! ' in the not too distant future our grandchildren will find this calendar in their attic or cellar ( do we still have those ? ) scratch their heads and think ...			0
what did people do inside those things ? ' but not a copy has been bought - with @entity91 and @entity93 calendars are leading sales ahead of the @entity14			0
disappointed @entity26 said : ' we now feel the need to confess and state , we may have crossed a boring bridge too far			1
' but , are we not all fed up with @entity98 , six - pack fireman , @entity100 , @entity91 and dare i say @entity93 ? people seem more interested in peeling back the months of @entity93 's sporty calendar than phone boxes in @entity7 buyers appear more willing to pin up the @entity91 boys then have the phone boxes adorn their homes ' we have created a calendar that is considered to be so hum - drum , so naff , so nerdy , so dull , so parochial that not even the most patriotic @entity7 person wants to buy a copy			0
' in short we have not sold one calendar and we are past mid-november in the shopping - run up to @entity113			0
' frustrated @entity26 added : ' looking at the front cover with a somewhat dilapidated red telephone box , coupled with two strutting @entity117 ducks in the obscure town of @entity119			1
' on @entity121 , maybe i can somewhat understand the lack of interest amongst the paying public out there			0
businessman @entity26 , of @entity126 , near @entity127 , started making calenders in 2003			1
he had a huge hit with 12 roundabouts in @entity126 - which sold 100,000 worldwide - but his best seller is a road kill calender			1
@entity26 , who runs the @entity133 , has also made calendars featuring prisons , graveyards and hospitals			1
@entity26 added : ' we pride ourselves on capturing slices of @entity6 life in calendar form that most people would n't take the time to appreciate			1
' case in point are our wonderful @entity146 which sell all around the world			0
' people now look upon these amazing round pieces of road - architecture and see them in a new light , an oasis on a sea of tarmac so to speak			0
' but the ' stunning and unique @entity7 calendar ' which went on the market in september has now flopped .			0

' @entity159 ' calender flops
publisher @entity26 , 61 , was responsible for unlikely seasonal hit roundabouts of @entity28 2012 and hoped to repeat success
