by @entity0 published : 03:53 est , 24 december 2012 updated : 06:15 est , 24 december 2012 choosing the best way to propose is never easy - but in the modern age , with twitter and other social networks running much of our social lives , it can be even tougher deciding how to pop the question and keep your plans quiet			2
however , for @entity13 , an @entity14 entrepreneur , @entity12 's status updates gave him the perfect vehicle to propose			1
mr @entity13 , 36 , decided to propose to girlfriend @entity17 , who is 30 , using @entity12 in a unique way			1
@entity13 , right , used @entity12 's status updates to propose to girlfriend @entity17 , lift - hacking her laptop so she was asked if she wanted to change her relationship status ' when i decided to propose to my girlfriend i knew it would be geeky , ' he said ' @entity24 geeky , i 'm not that hardcore , but something geeky nonetheless			1
' i threw around a few ideas , i knew i wanted to surprise her out of the blue , i wanted to do something that required investment ( and not just half - ass it ) , but i did n't want it to be too grandiose ( we 're both not into those kinds of things )			0
mr @entity13 eventually decided on @entity12 , and set about writing some code that would hijack her laptop , allowing him to fool her into thinking she was receiving real @entity12 messages when , in fact , they were written by him			2
' since this was a marriage proposal , the obvious place to mess with her on @entity12 was the relationship status			1
' @entity13 's proposal hijacked his girlfriend 's @entity12 feed , fooling her into thinking she was receive real requests			1
first , he asked her for some basic information he then asked her to confirm her relationship status - with a menu that showed married , whatever menu option was chosen each time @entity17 selected single , it showed her this message the software , controlled by @entity13 , then asked her to select her husband , showing a selection of their friends the image then changed to a picture of @entity13 - at which point he appeared in front of the screen with a ring ' she was floored : ) , ' wrote mr @entity13			1
' she had no idea till that second what was going on - luckily for me , she said yes ! ' ' a few minutes of mushiness ensued while we collected ourselves and indulged in the moment , and then i explained to her how the whole thing worked			0
' to top all this off , the next thing i obviously had to do was update my @entity79 with the good news and that was how my @entity82 found out i proposed			0
' when i called her to tell her the good news she answered saying " i need to discover on @entity79 that you proposed ? "			0
she was a great sport about it			0
' ' from the moment i decided i want to propose till the actual proposal was a bit less than 2 weeks , ' mr @entity13 told @entity90			2
' the actual development took about a week , and a few more days before that for creating the design and specs for how it should behave			0

@entity13 hijacked his girlfriend @entity12 *account* to ask for her in marriage hand in a unique way
the 36 - year - old @entity14 entrepreneur wrote a program for her *computer* that asked her to change her relationship status to ' married '
