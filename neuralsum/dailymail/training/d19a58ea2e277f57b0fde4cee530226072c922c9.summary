' it 's the first time in many of these leaks that there are really strong allegations not of egregious tax avoidance , but of tax evasion , and that is incredibly serious			2
' for you to sit there and say , as you are doing , that ‘ we could n't get the money in in the same way as the @entity186 and @entity188 did ’ and ‘ we did n't litigate because we wanted to get the money in ’ and yet you did worse on the money - it leaves me believing that you are not serving the @entity135 taxpayer			0
