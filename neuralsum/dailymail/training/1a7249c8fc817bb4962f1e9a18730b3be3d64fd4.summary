@entity1 midfielder @entity0 was sad to see @entity2 leave for @entity3 , but does not believe it represents the end of the club 's rise to prominence			1
saints excelled under @entity2 last season , finishing in eighth place in the @entity12 and drawing admiring glances across the board for their style of play			1
such success was always likely to attract interest from elsewhere and , like their former manager , the likes of @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24 have all been linked with high - profile transfers this @entity26 scroll down to see @entity2 confirmed as new @entity3 manager belief : @entity0 reckons that @entity1 can continue to progress without @entity2 unveiled : @entity2 has made the move from @entity1 to @entity3 @entity30 captain @entity0 , who found out about @entity2 's departure while on international duty in @entity33 , admits it is a tough time but expects the structure that exists at @entity36 's to continue yielding benefits			1
' it 's a blow for everybody to lose him , you ca n't really get away from that , and the players all loved working for him , ' said @entity0			2
' he pushed us on from where we were at before he came in ; everyone personally improved , results improved as well and things were looking bright for the future			0
' it 's disappointing but at the same time i do n't think it will affect the club in terms of progression because there is still a lot of growth left in the team			2
' the club has come a long way in the last five years and the blueprint has been evident under each and every manager			0
' there is no reason why that should stop now and everyone will want to get going forward to achieve our goals			0
' moving : @entity23 and @entity22 are two of @entity1 's young stars that have been tipped for a move outgoing : and @entity24 would have been another were it not for his injury whether @entity1 continue to grow and defy expectations is likely to depend in large part on how successful they are in rebuffing interest in their star assets from the likes of @entity82 , @entity83 and now @entity2 's @entity3			1
dream moves for the likes of @entity23 and @entity22 to @entity86 and @entity87 have been mooted for some time now , but @entity0 is not treating their departures as a done deals			1
' i 'm sure the owners will be doing their utmost now to get the best person possible in and ensure the we can keep the squad together , ' he said			0
' there 's obviously rumours even before the manager left and that was well documented but that was based on us having a really good season			2
' you ca n't stop that and it 's always difficult if a top four club comes in to keep a hold of them , but i always felt all the players bought into what the club is trying to achieve and everyone is happy there			2
battler : @entity0 fighting @entity115 's @entity114 ( left ) and @entity116 for the ball ' i hope that is still the case and all the lads really enjoy working with each other and trying to push the club forward			1
' @entity0 will lead his country out against @entity126 's @entity125 opponents @entity33 on friday , and has vowed to pass any nuggets of information on to his friends in @entity131 's squad			0
' nobody has asked me just yet to get information on @entity33 but i was texting @entity22 , just talking about the games coming up and how things were going , " he said			0
' if there is anything i can tell him , @entity136 or @entity23 to help them then of course i will but i have no doubt they will be well briefed when it comes to their game with @entity33			0
