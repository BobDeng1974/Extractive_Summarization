by @entity0 published : 20:40 est , 9 march 2013 updated : 02:59 est , 11 march 2013 an @entity2 actress has been refused permission to live in the @entity4 with her @entity4 husband after immigration officials ruled that he was too poor to support her			1
@entity7 , who appeared in @entity10 ’s inspector @entity8 last year , says the enforced separation is taking a toll on her health			2
her visa was rejected because her rock singer spouse @entity15 earned just £ 7,221 last year – well below the £ 18,600 threshold required by new immigration laws			1
@entity2 @entity7 has been denied a @entity4 visa because her @entity4 husband is too poor to support her she earned more than that , but @entity21 officials considered only her husband ’s earnings			1
last night , @entity25 mp @entity24 criticised the ‘ discriminatory ’ rules , saying they ‘ put a price on love ’ , and he pointed out that @entity31 citizens can now bring @entity33 spouses to the @entity4 more easily than @entity4 nationals can			1
@entity7 ’s lawyer has already appealed the decision , citing controversial human rights legislation that protects the right to family life			1
the 26 - year - old actress said : ‘ it was devastating when i received the rejection			2
we only got married a few months ago and all we want to do is share our lives together			2
i felt like the acting was just taking off , but now it ’s all had to be put on hold			2
’ @entity15 , 27 , added : ‘ the decision has taken its toll on my personal and mental health			1
a lot of it ’s down to not being able to sleep			0
it ’s extremely frustrating but , more than that , i ’ve lost faith in the way i live my life as a @entity4 citizen			0
i feel at my wits ’ end			0
’ their treatment by the @entity61 contrasts with that of other @entity31 citizens living here , who can apply for an @entity66 family permit for @entity33 spouses to join them – which has no minimum income requirement			0
@entity4 citizens living elsewhere in the @entity31 can also apply for the @entity66 family permit , then use that visa to settle back in the @entity4			0
@entity4 immigration officials deemed rock singer @entity15 too poor to support his @entity2 wife @entity7 but because @entity15 already lives in @entity4 , his wife must apply for a settlement visa , which has the financial requirement			1
mr @entity24 , who sits on the @entity77 , said : ‘ this is a discriminatory policy because it means a @entity4 national can not bring a wife or husband to @entity4 from outside the @entity31 unless they have certain level of wealth			1
‘ it is also strange that the government should introduce stricter rules for @entity4 citizens than those in force for @entity92 citizens			0
’ @entity7 ’s lawyer @entity93 said : ‘ @entity15 and @entity94 will fight this unfair decision on the principle of fairness			1
their private and family life is being destroyed by the harsh application of the new immigration rules			1
’ the couple wed last september in @entity104 ’s @entity103 , as @entity94 was establishing herself as an actress and singer			0
but two months later she was forced to return to @entity2 after her @entity108 visa expired			0
she applied for a @entity4 settlement visa , but this was rejected based on her husband ’s earnings			1
she had been offered a £ 26,500 - a - year job as an estate agent in @entity115 , but the @entity21 did not allow that to be taken into account when considering the income threshold , introduced last july			2
@entity94 even has some high - level backing for her case			0
senior civil servant sir @entity121 , former chairman of the @entity122 and a long - standing family friend , said : ‘ @entity94 is an asset to the @entity4 , fully able to support herself and happily married to a @entity4 national			2
it is tragic that unthinking application of the new rules is keeping them apart			0
’ the @entity131 said : ‘ under the free movement directive , @entity133 nationals are able to bring family members to the @entity4			0
however , they do not have unrestricted access to the @entity4 – they must be working , studying or be self - sufficient			0

@entity15 *'s* £ 7,000 earnings deemed *insufficient* to support @entity139
she earned more than her husband , but immigration officials overlooked this
