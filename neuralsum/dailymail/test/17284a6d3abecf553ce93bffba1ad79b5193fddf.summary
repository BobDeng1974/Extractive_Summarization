pensions minister @entity0 has now urged people to not make rash decisions he is the @entity3 who famously said we should be free to blow our life savings on a @entity6			1
but after liberating a nation to spend their money as they wish , @entity0 has now urged people to take their time rather than make rash decisions			1
yesterday the biggest pension reforms in a century were launched , allowing over- 55s to cash in their pension pots rather than being forced to buy a fixed monthly income			1
but as @entity19 finally arrived , the government appealed for caution , perhaps fearing that some people will quickly exhaust their funds and be forced to rely on the @entity23			2
mr @entity0 said over- 55s ‘ do n’t have to rush this ’ and insisted there was ‘ a case for waiting and seeing ’			1
he said april 6 was the ‘ starting gun ’ and not a ‘ deadline ’ , adding : ‘ we want people to make informed choices			2
this is n’t a mad scramble rush to do something this morning			0
’ asked about his flippant remark last year that people should be able to buy a @entity6 with their pension , he admitted ‘ you will pay a hell of a lot of tax ’ if you do			2
while the first 25 per cent of any withdrawals from pensions are tax - free , savers will have to pay income tax on the remainder			0
those who withdraw their pension in one go face hefty bills if they are pushed into a higher tax bracket			0
official forecasts show that the @entity50 is set to receive an additional £ 370million of income tax in the next year as a result of the changes			0
research by consumer group which ? shows that buying a £ 228,000 @entity72 would incur a £ 126,000 tax bill if you withdrew the cash in one go – enough to buy a @entity77			1
but a study by insurer @entity78 found that a third of over- 55s were unaware of the tax implications of withdrawing all their money at once			1
spokesman @entity85 said : ‘ people could lose out on thousands of pounds of their hard - earned savings			0
’ @entity88 leader @entity88 - who was out campaigning with the energy secretary @entity89 in @entity90 , @entity91 , today - has hailed the pensions reforms and yesterday dr @entity94 , the government ’s champion for older workers , warned that people who withdraw their cash could be hit with a ‘ triple tax whammy ’ – on their withdrawal , on any new investment and because the money no longer had tax - free status			2
she urged caution , and said that right now she would advise pensioners to ‘ do nothing ’			0
the new reforms will allow 2.1million over- 55s to withdraw all or part of their funds rather than being required to buy an annuity			1
studies show many will use at least part of their money to go on holiday , pay off debts , renovate their homes or help their family financially			0
however it could take time for people to get their hands on their pension pot. while all firms must allow people to take their entire lump sum , many will not allow partial withdrawals			2
this means many customers will have to switch companies , incurring exit fees and involving time - consuming paperwork			0
@entity134 , of the @entity135 , said she would advise pensioners ‘ not to book the cruise right now ’			0
experts fear pensioners could be vulnerable if they do not receive proper advice regarding pension plans now that over- 55s can cash in their pensions and spend them instead of being forced to buy an annuity ( file image )			1

over- 55s are now able to cash in their pensions instead of buying annuity
pensions minister @entity0 said people should buy whatever they want
he said : ' if you want to enjoy it , why should *n't* you be able to do that ? '
now , mr @entity0 is urging people to take time and not make rash decisions
