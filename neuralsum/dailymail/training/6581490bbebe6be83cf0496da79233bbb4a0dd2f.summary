by @entity0 a mayor has been accused of running his town ‘ like @entity3 ’ after trying to expel a councillor from a debate for tweeting			1
@entity6 continued to air his views on @entity8 after @entity9 told members not to use the network in meetings , so the mayor told the independent @entity14 councillor to go and called police when he refused			1
two police community support officers arrived , but councillor @entity6 knew that , by law , only a fully qualified police officer could eject a member from a council meeting , so continued to stand his ground			1
the steps of @entity14 town hall : councillor @entity6 only left after a police officer came from 20 miles away because there were no free officers in the town to attend , it was another 20 minutes before a policeman arrived from 25 miles away , in @entity30 , @entity31			1
amid farcical scenes , the officer admitted no law had been broken , so councillor @entity35 could not be arrested			2
instead he asked councillor @entity35 to leave , which he agreed to do , and he was escorted out of the @entity37			1
several other opposition councillors then followed him out the door in protest at his treatment			0
last night the meeting was likened to a pantomime , with the mayor saying his grandchildren were better behaved than some members			2
councillor @entity6 said @entity14 was being run like ‘ @entity3 ’ by @entity47 , who were using the ban to stifle any criticism of their policies			1
he said calling the police was a ‘ joke ’ and such ‘ heavy - handed ’ tactics were a complete waste of tax - payers ’ cash			2
‘ we are meant to live in a democracy and operate open and transparent politics to engage the public , but this behaviour is more akin to @entity3 than @entity64 , ’ councillor @entity6 said			1
‘ the mayor requests that members do n’t tweet from meetings because , they say , we should be concentrating fully on what ’s going on			2
‘ but that ’s just a smoke screen , what they really mean is they do n’t want anyone tweeting anything critical of their policies because they want to be in control of the messages seen by the public			0
‘ it ’s a complete joke			0
‘ it was n’t my intention to disrupt the meeting but i thought it was important to stand my ground			0
they were making it up as they went along and i knew that they could n’t just throw me out			0
‘ calling the police was heavy - handed and a complete waste of taxpayers ’ money			2
i knew they were behaving unlawfully and i had to stand up for freedom of speech			0
’ councillor @entity6 said he ‘ could n’t help ’ taking to the social network when the council leader began referring to a recent survey claiming than 99 per cent of all @entity14 residents were happy with the council ’s performance			1
he tweeted : ‘ leader says 99 % of residents are happy with council			0
i bet 99 % or not happy in @entity107 and other areas			0
’ councillor @entity6 added : ‘ i just did n’t believe it , so i passed a comment on @entity8			1
‘ they must have put a council officer in the chamber to watch me because the next thing i knew she was pointing to my phone and the chief executive was informed			0
’ the offending tweet : councillor @entity6 believes an official must have been watching his @entity8 feed councillor @entity35 also accused the @entity47 administration of ‘ double standards ’ after it emerged another councillor , @entity47 ’s @entity123 , also tweeted during the meeting			1
she was not thrown out because she supposedly only passed comment on councillor @entity35 ’s ‘ disgraceful behaviour ’ once the meeting was stopped , while she was waiting for him to be removed			2
mayor @entity9 told councillor @entity35 : ‘ i have got grandchildren who do n’t behave like you do			1
’ while leader lord @entity130 later lamented that it was ‘ the most atrocious meeting ’ he had ever been to			0
councillor @entity6 said he would be complaining to local government minister @entity132 about the council , although stopped short of saying he would take legal action against them			1
mr @entity132 announced plans in november to introduce legislation giving people the right to report , film , blog and tweet from council proceedings			0
the changes - part of the @entity148 and @entity149 - would ‘ unlock the mysteries of local government , making it more transparent for all , ’ he said			0
but so far @entity14 has resisted implementing such plans			2
the council is one of @entity47 ’s safest local councils in the country , with 63 of the 75 councillors affiliated to the party .			0

@entity14 councillor @entity6 ignored a @entity8 ban in meetings
mayor told the independent to leave when he *flouted* the rule
mr @entity6 only left after a police man came from 20 miles away
