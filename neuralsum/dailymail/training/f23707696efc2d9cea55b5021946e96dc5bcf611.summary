by @entity0 published : 18:33 est , 18 august 2013 updated : 03:00 est , 19 august 2013 influence ? it has been unveiled that the @entity4 's staff have been working in key government departments prince @entity6 has been accused of planting ' moles ' in the heart of government after it emerged members of his staff had been working full - time in @entity14 departments			1
one of his employees was seconded to a policy team at the @entity17 for around a year			1
another aide working for the heir to the throne spent two years at the @entity21 , which deals with cross-cutting issues across the whole of government and is based next to @entity25			1
a third was based there for six weeks			0
the allegations sparked further allegations that the @entity4 was meddling in government and abandoning the traditional of royal neutrality in politics - with one mp describing him as a ' constitutional crisis in waiting '			1
the @entity36 , which exposed the existence of the seconded staff , said that some current and former ministers in the two departments knew nothing of the appointments			2
the revelations come a week after the @entity44 disclosed that the @entity4 has had 36 private audiences with cabinet ministers since the election - one a month			1
alongside seven meetings with the prime minister , he also met a disproportionately high number of ministers from departments representing issues of personal interest to him , including the environment , alternative medicine and town planning			0
it raised questions over whether the @entity4 was lobbying for his pet issues			1
but @entity61 robustly defended the summits , saying it was his right and duty to meet any minister ' he chooses '			0
they also said some meetings were requested by the ministers rather than the @entity4			1
and last night they defended the presence of the prince 's staff in government , denying claims that the secondees were doing the @entity4 's work in government			1
a spokeswoman said the three secondees were junior members of staff , aged in their 20s , who would not have come into contact with the @entity4 very often			1
she pointed out that the staff made their own requests for experience in government departments for their own professional development reasons			2
prince @entity6 has a keen interest in rural affairs and the environment @entity93 mp @entity92 , member of the @entity95 public administration committee , said news of the secondments suggested the prince was a ' constitutional crisis in waiting '			1
' planting his civil service moles proves an intention to abandon royal political neutrality , ' he said			0
' he clearly does n't accept the principle of an independent and politically neutral monarchy			0
i am astonished that he should have had his people in the civil service in this way with ministers not even being aware they were there			0
' constitutional monarchs should be above politics			2
what is he doing except to advance his own agenda ? it 's outrageous			0
' @entity115 , another @entity93 backbencher , said the @entity116 needed an explanation as to why this had been allowed to happen			0
' it raises constitutional questions about the influence the monarch - in - waiting has over policy and there will be questions in the @entity116 when it returns , ' he said			1
it is not the first time concerns have been raised over the @entity4 's influence on the political process yesterday one minister in one of the two departments affected said he had no idea that a member of the @entity4 's staff was working there - and demanded to know if they had any influence on policy			1
he told the @entity36 it was ' undemocratic ' and said : ' there are urgent questions that need to be answered about who agreed it			0
' it raises questions about whether prince @entity6 is exceeding his position as constitutional monarch in waiting			2
there is a question about what they are doing and whether they are influencing policy			2
' later this year , the public administration committee will conduct an investigation into the @entity4 's constitutional position which means ministers have been forced to seek his permission to pass at least a dozen government bills			1
the committee will ask whether there is a risk that the requirement of royal consent ' could be seen as politicising the monarchy '			0
a spokeswoman for @entity61 would not provide the identities of the secondees or say what tasks they had undertaken			0
she said staff from departments such as the @entity174 are often seconded with the @entity4 's office			1
' we have had two secondments to government departments in the past two years , ' she said			2
' the secondments were suggested on the basis of professional development and the paperwork was arranged by the relevant @entity184 departments			0
' one secondment was one year and the other was for two years			2
both have some to a natural conclusion			0
there was no official feedback mechanism and no regular meetings were attended with the @entity4 's household			2
' the secondments were on a like - for - like basis			0
one secondee has now left @entity61 and the other is due to return shortly after a sabbatical			0
' over the past five years , in addition to the two secondments already discussed , there has been one other secondment , for six weeks to the @entity21			1
we have no new secondments planned at present			0
' @entity17 said the @entity4 's aide was not involved in any issues related to the @entity209 , his landholding from which he made Â£ 19million last year .			1

one of his employees was seconded to a policy team at @entity17
