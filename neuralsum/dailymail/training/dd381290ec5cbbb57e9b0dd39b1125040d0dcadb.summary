@entity0 is still struggling with the biggest decision of his career so far as @entity4 coach – to start , or not to start , with @entity5			1
@entity7 viewers will miss the first 15 minutes of saturday 's game due to broadcasting regulations			1
in the build up to the midweek match with @entity11 , @entity0 told reporters before the game that @entity14 would definitely be playing - effectively revealing his starting line - up			2
' no , i ca n't play that game today , ' he said on friday when asked if wanted to repeat the early shout on who was in and who was out			2
@entity0 ( background ) confirmed that @entity5 will make his debut in the match against @entity24 on saturday @entity5 looked relaxed in training with @entity26 ( right ) and @entity27 ahead of his debut in saturday 's @entity28 @entity5 joins his teammates in a training session at @entity31 in @entity4 on friday @entity0 confirmed that @entity5 will ' get some minutes ' for @entity4 on saturday against @entity24 @entity5 ( second right ) is the centre of attention as he trains with his team - mates prior to saturday 's match @entity5 ( second left ) looked relaxed in training with @entity38 ( left ) , @entity26 ( right ) and @entity39 @entity5 ( left ) has featured for @entity4 's reserve side since his £ 75million move from @entity42 over summer the @entity43 will play his first competitive match after serving a four - month ban for biting @entity46 ' @entity5 will get minutes but i ca n't say how many , ' he said			1
' this is a great chance for him to incorporate himself in the team			0
how many minutes he will get i ca n't say			0
' when asked if it was better for a player to start a game or come on in the second half after such a long lay - off , he against batted away the inquiry saying : ' every player is different for some players it 's better to play from the start for others to come on in the second half			2
' @entity5 's anxiety to kick - off his @entity4 career lends itself to throwing him in from the first kick but @entity0 has also practiced with a four man midfield this week , with @entity66 back in the side alongside @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70 behind a front two of @entity39 and @entity26			1
if @entity0 opts for that tactic his formation will mirror @entity74 's who looks set to play @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 and @entity79 in midfield having confirmed @entity81 will miss the game with a buttock injury			1
@entity24 's @entity81 will not feature in this season 's first @entity28 as a buttock injury has sidelined the @entity86 @entity87 ( left ) stretches alongside @entity79 ( centre ) and @entity89 in a @entity24 training session @entity24 defender @entity91 stretches out as he prepares to face the creativity of @entity4 @entity91 ( left ) and @entity87 looked focused in training ahead of the season 's first @entity28 clash @entity87 ( left ) and @entity79 ( right ) look focused in training ahead a tough test on saturday against their bitter rivals @entity99 ( left ) competes with @entity100 defender @entity89 in an aerial duel during @entity24 's training session goalkeepers @entity103 ( right ) and @entity104 ( left ) warm up in a training session on friday @entity74 ( left ) will not have @entity81 at his disposal for saturday 's game against @entity4 due to injury @entity24 : @entity103 ; @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity91 , @entity89 ; @entity77 , @entity79 , @entity76 , @entity78 ; @entity87 , @entity111 @entity4 : @entity112 ; @entity113 , @entity27 , @entity38 , @entity114 ; @entity115 , @entity69 , @entity68 ; @entity5 , @entity26 , @entity39 ' the absence of @entity81 does not change the way we will play the game			1
we have our ideas and follow them			0
we do n't change , ' said @entity0 , who despite the bravado will know @entity24 are a different proposition without @entity81 , leaning more on possession and less on explosive counter attacks			1
there was one thing both coaches agreed to be unhappy with – the kick - off time			0
the game has been scheduled for 6pm local time to reach a wider global television audience at prime time			0
@entity74 has complained most vehemently after his side had to travel back from @entity42 after their later midweek @entity135 game			1
' @entity74 is right when he says the kick - off time is not ideal , ' said @entity0			0
' it is a problem for all of us but everything works around the interests of television			0
it is a lot better for all of us playing later			0
' the @entity4 coach also said that he was not worried about provocation from @entity110 on saturday as @entity5 plays his first competitive game since biting @entity148 's @entity46			1
he said : ' there is physical contact in football and we accept that and there is also a referee to make sure there is fair play			0
i 'm sure it will be a great game and a good spectacle			0
' on @entity5 , @entity74 said : ' i am not here to judge the behaviour of @entity5			2
i rate him a lot as a player , he is a fantastic player , he scored a lot of goals in @entity167 but whether he plays or not does not change our tactics for the game if they are with @entity5 or without @entity5 – it is good news for football that @entity5 can play in the @entity175 league			2
' @entity176 ( left ) looks at @entity24 's inventive midfield while @entity178 ( right ) focuses on @entity0 both as ( left ) and @entity181 's front pages lead on @entity74 's approach to saturday 's game			1

@entity5 will make his debut for @entity4 in their @entity28 clash with @entity24 on saturday night
but @entity24 's @entity81 will not feature as the @entity86 is suffering from a buttock *muscle* injury
@entity5 has not played a competitive game for @entity4 since his £ 75million move from @entity42
