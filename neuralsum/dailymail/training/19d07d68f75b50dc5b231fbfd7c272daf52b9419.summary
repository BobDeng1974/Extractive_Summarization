by @entity0 published : 10:58 est , 9 april 2013 updated : 01:48 est , 10 april 2013 a @entity2 paedophile has been given thousands of pounds by a human rights court – and released on to the streets			1
ministers have spent more than a decade trying and failing to deport @entity6 , who is thought to have cost taxpayers more than £ 600,000 in jail costs and legal aid			1
but yesterday @entity11 judges ordered the @entity13 government to pay the convicted child rapist thousands of pounds in damages and legal costs			1
human rights : the court in @entity11 found that the decision to re-detain @entity6 in 2008 was not lawful because the required reviews were n't carried out the court said @entity6 was ‘ wrongfully detained ’ for two and a half years , breaching his right to liberty			1
ministers had decided he should remain in jail while awaiting deportation because he presented a ‘ high risk ’ to the public			2
but it emerged he was released from prison in january this year because there was no prospect of him being deported any time soon			0
he has spent around 13 years in jail and received tens of thousands of pounds in legal aid to help him thwart deportation			1
last night @entity36 officials were still insisting they would ‘ continue to seek to deport ’ him – despite having failed to do so since 2002			0
@entity6 , who was born in 1975 , arrived in @entity13 in may 1995			2
his asylum claim was rejected , but he was given leave to remain in @entity13 until february 2000			0
@entity39 : the court ordered the government to pay @entity6 , who is being held at @entity42 ( pictured ) , £ 1,277 in damages , and a further £ 5,960 to cover legal costs in 1998 he was convicted of rape and indecency with a child and sentenced to eight years in prison			1
in may 2002 @entity49 , then home secretary , ordered his deportation – but @entity6 made the first of several appeals			1
while in prison he was assessed as presenting a ‘ high risk ’ of sexual offending if let out			0
as a result he was detained after his sentence was completed while ministers tried to deport him			0
they were thwarted because no airline was prepared to fly him , or any other @entity2 nationals , back home against their will			2
@entity6 refused to return home voluntarily			2
in september 2006 he was given permission to apply for a judicial review of the decision to keep him behind bars			0
he won his initial case , but the @entity69 ruled that his detention between december 2004 and june 2006 was lawful because he could have returned to @entity2 voluntarily			2
he was let out in april 2007 but arrested again a year later after breaching his bail conditions by failing to report to police			0
ministers struggle to return @entity2 nationals home , even those convicted of heinous crimes , because of another ruling by the @entity78			1
yesterday the same court overturned the @entity13 court ’s ruling and said his detention was unlawful because regular case reviews did not take place			0
the @entity11 judges ordered the government to pay £ 1,277 ( 1,500 euros ) in damages and £ 5,960 ( 7,000 euros ) for legal costs and expenses			1
it is thought he has received between £ 20,000 and £ 30,000 in legal aid in @entity13 , while taxpayers have also had to cough up £ 45,000 a year for jail costs			1
a @entity36 spokesman said : ‘ we are extremely disappointed with the court ’s decision and are urgently reviewing our options			0
‘ we will continue to seek to deport this individual who has shown a complete disregard for the laws of this country			0
‘ we believe it is right that dangerous individuals are kept in detention , wherever possible , in order to protect the public			0
