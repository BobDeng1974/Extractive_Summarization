diversity : @entity1 , vice chancellor of @entity2 , said students ' values were changing a university is considering ending the sale of alcohol on campus due to concerns from @entity11 students			1
@entity2 could take action because a ‘ high percentage ’ of its students thought drinking was ‘ immoral ’ , according to its vice chancellor			1
professor @entity1 raised the prospect of an alcohol - free campus after gauging the changing values from the influx of new students			2
he said it would be unwise to ‘ cling ’ to a ‘ nostalgic ' view where the vast majority wanted alcohol to be available and instead take account of diverging views			2
he told @entity28 : ‘ i was raising the issue of changing values in student populations and the question of how a responsible university responds			0
‘ @entity2 is a highly diverse university ethnically and in religious terms			2
' ' our students come from all over the world and they come with changing balance of values			2
‘ so the issue of how we cater for those values while still remaining true to being a @entity43 university is one of the constant issues any responsible university would be considering			0
‘ we do have a high percentage of @entity11 students – we estimate it may be around 20 per cent for our university			1
' and therefore as most @entity11 do look on drink as something which is n’t an acceptable part of everyday life , seeing how do we provide an environment that can respect that , while also respecting values of people such as me who do drink , and who believe drink in moderation is acceptable part – in fact sometimes a good part - of a social community			1
’ sensitivity : the @entity64 , one of @entity2 's two bars , could be alcohol free as the institution attempts to respect the changing values of students professor @entity1 first raised the subject during a speech to the @entity75 ' annual conference in @entity76 on 3 april			1
@entity2 was founded in 2002 - an amalgamation of two longstanding institutions , the @entity78 and the @entity79			1
it has around 30,000 students from 190 countries who attend campuses in north @entity84 , on @entity85 , and the @entity86 near @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity90 tube stations			1
he added : ‘ here ’s the problem for @entity84			0
the majority of our students in @entity84 primary schools now have a home language other than @entity99 – in other words they come from a very diverse ethnic base			0
‘ as we go through the next 10 or 20 years in @entity84 , we are going to find these cultural values and their differences become more and more important in society			0
’ professor @entity1 said he would work with the student body to move towards having areas on campus where ‘ one serves alcohol and others do n't ’ , but could foresee a time when the university was an alcohol - free zone			0
he added : ' that 's what education 's actually about , modeling diverse behaviours so we create liberal students in a liberal intellectual environment			0
' he questioned whether the university should subsidise student bars , although it was not an issue he felt ‘ too strongly ’ about , adding : ' this is about how best you use limited resources to cater to the broadest range of students ' .			0

@entity2 is trying to be sensitive to views of its 30,000 students - 20 per cent of whom are @entity11
