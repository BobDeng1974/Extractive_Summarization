@entity8 , from @entity9 , has two life passions - skateboarding and photography , and in particular , photographing skateboarders			1
discouraged by the ' meaninglessness of most digital images ' he has found a technique that he says reconnects him to the process of truly capturing a person 's character in a picture			1
using the traditional collodion process , mr @entity21 now plans to journey across the @entity24 in his newly converted motorhome - turned - dark - room , to capture the people he finds most fascinating - skateboarding ' lifers ' - people from all walks of life who have devoted their lives to their love of the street sport			1
@entity42 , @entity43 , a lifelong skateboarder in @entity9 seeing into the soul : mr @entity21 says using collodion to photograph his skateboarding subjects allows him to see into their souls			1
pictured , @entity49 , from @entity50 , @entity51 , in a wet plate collodion image he says his collodion black and white pictures ' see beneath the skin ' of his subjects , because of collodion 's ' sensitivity to see the uv light '			1
' what better way to see these people in their rawest form and capture the real person inside , ' he said			0
in a video posted on his own website , mr @entity8 says he has been devoted to both skateboarding and photography since the age of 10			1
he bought his first skateboard at around the same time as picking up his first camera in a flea market			0

two passions : mr @entity21 says he bought his first skateboard the same time as his first camera in a flea market , aged 10 and been fascinated by both ever since			0
@entity42 , @entity79 of @entity80 , @entity51 , a lifelong skateboarder ' @entity82 ' , from @entity83 , @entity84 , captured in 2004 using a wet plate collodion image , made by @entity86			1
wet plate collodion photography , invented in 1851 , has experienced a resurge in recent years as photographers turn to this antiquated method for its moody , even haunting , images ' one of the things about photography that i have always loved is looking at old prints and wondering the story behind the photo			2
' looking at a good portrait should feel like you are catching a glimpse of a person 's soul and gives you an immediate insight into their life			2
' the best way of doing this , he says , is to revert back to using collodion to take pictures			2
' in this digital world we get further and further away from the real meaning of photography			0
' escaping from this disconnect , mr @entity21 has invested his ' heart , soul and life savings ' into this dream			0
this circa 1856 collodion photo provided by mr @entity21 shows @entity122 at age 25 with his wife , @entity124 , age 19 , at a sitting in @entity127 , @entity126 he has bought and converted a motorhome to act as his transport , home , and dark room			1
and now he 's hitting the road , to find and photograph skateboarding ' lifers '			0
' to some , these poeple might be misconstrued as outcasts , but they are often some of the smartest people i have met , ' he says			0
' lifers are a breed of people that eat , sleep and breath skateboarding just becasue they love it			0
processing : using the collodion technique takes time and effort , unlike digital photography			2
mr @entity21 , pictured , has returned to this process to reconnect with the physical art of photography after being inspired by other local photographers ' pictures @entity157 investment : he has bought and converted a motorhome into a dark room and now mr @entity21 is driving across the @entity24 to find and photograph lifetime skateboarders using the centuries - old technique ' regardless of age , social status or yearly salaries , lifers dedicate their lives to skateboarding and the lifestyle it has to offer			1
' from our neighborus with backyard pools all the way to the legends that have skateboarding what it is today , lifers are the backbone of the skateboarding community			0
' now he is asking for help to support his dream to ' capture the essence of a true lifer '			0
anyone wishing to follow mr @entity8 's project can do so here .			2
