a father told last night of his anguish and betrayal after discovering a friend had stolen his wife and his identity ... and vanished for 25 years			1
@entity6 was left to bring up his two young children alone when his wife @entity8 went missing in 1988			1
the trail remained cold until police took a second look at the missing persons inquiry two years ago and traced mrs @entity13 150 miles away in @entity14 – where she was found living with mr @entity6 ’s former friend @entity15 – a wanted paedophile			1
@entity15 was due to stand trial for child sex offences in may 1988 , when he ran away at the time his wife had gone missing , mr @entity6 did not realise his friend had also vanished			1
but he began to wonder whether they could be together and his suspicions were confirmed in 2007 when he found out by chance @entity15 had applied for a passport in his name			2
yesterday , mr @entity6 spoke of his ordeal after @entity15 was finally convicted of the historical sex offences for which he had fled justice			1
mr @entity6 , 59 , said : ‘ in all those years i never once heard from my wife and neither did my children			1
we had no idea where she was			0
‘ all i could do was get on with my life , which was very difficult with two children under six			0
’ @entity15 – then known as @entity34 – fled with @entity8 in may 1988 , three weeks before he was due to stand trial for ten child sex offences			1
@entity13 , now @entity15 , ran off with her best friend 's husband and left her two young daughters behind the pair , both now 61 , changed their surnames by deed poll to @entity15			1
mr @entity6 , from @entity44 , @entity45 , told how officials missed an opportunity to bring the couple to justice seven years ago			1
by then , long after suspecting the pair were together , mr @entity6 had remarried for a second time			2
@entity52 also took her husband 's @entity54 guitar , which was similar to this one owned by the former @entity57 star , @entity56 he applied for a passport to go on holiday with third wife @entity60 , 63 , but was told a document had already been issued in his name			2
when officials printed off a picture of the man who obtained the passport , mr @entity6 confirmed it was @entity15			1
but it appears @entity70 officials failed to report the matter to police , allowing the couple to remain on the run			2
@entity75 heard last month how @entity15 – who had abandoned a girlfriend and daughter when he fled – worked on farms in @entity14 picking fruit			1
he used mr @entity6 ’s birth and marriage certificates to obtain a passport to travel to @entity84 to pick olives			2
he later also obtained a driving licence in mr @entity6 ’s name			0
mr @entity6 heard nothing about his former wife until a cold case review tracked her to @entity91 in 2012			1
@entity15 was formally arrested the following year			2
he stood trial for the historical sex offences last month , after the pair had pleaded guilty to conspiracy to pervert the course of justice from 1988 to december 2013			1
they will be sentenced next month			0
after @entity15 was arrested , his victim made a fresh statement detailing how she was abused by him from the age of eight			0
mr @entity6 believes his wife met @entity15 while working at a bar , but said he had no inkling they were having an affair			1
he said : ‘ one night @entity8 told me she was going to a party			0
we had a babysitter as i was going out to the pub. when i came home she was n’t back			0
' the next morning i realised some of her clothes were gone			0
' whatever @entity15 has done , she has gone along with him for the last 25 years			2
i hope they have a nice time in jail			0
’ @entity15 ’s daughter described her father as a ‘ complete monster ’			0
@entity122 , 30 , said : ‘ i was five when he went missing			0
all i can remember is he put on his big boots and was gone			0
' all i would want would be to ask why			0
why did you walk out on us , why did you abuse your victim ? he is a bad , bad man			0
