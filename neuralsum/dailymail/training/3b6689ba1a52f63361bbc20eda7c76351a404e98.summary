by @entity0 last updated at 1:10 pm on 15th february 2012 allies of @entity3 president @entity2 have started a smear campaign against the country 's new opposition leader - by questioning his sexuality and mocking his @entity9 roots			2
a torrent of abuse was directed at @entity12 just minutes after his landslide win at the @entity15 's primary election on sunday			1
and it shows no sign of stopping - indicating that the battle for power in the october 7 presidential election will be fiercely fought			1
smear : allies of @entity2 ( left ) are trying to discredit @entity12 ( right ) who on sunday was named as the leader of the opposition with @entity2 himself uncharacteristically quiet , senior officials and state media have led the attack , denouncing @entity12 - a 39 - year - old state governor who wants to be @entity3 's youngest leader - as ' bourgeois ' and ' fascist			1
' @entity32 leader @entity31 , a former military comrade and longtime staunch supporter of the socialist president , said : ' now we know who is the candidate of imperialism , of capitalism and the right wing			0
the anti-patriotic candidate has a face			0
he wo n't have an easy election campaign			2
' @entity12 - the grandson of @entity9 who survived the @entity43 in @entity44 - defines himself as a centre - left ' progressive ' who admires @entity49 's ' modern left ' model of free - market economics with a strong social conscience			1
the attacks against him foreshadow a tough election battle in the polarised @entity56 @entity55 member nation , where @entity2 has strong support among the poor and denounces opponents as representatives of a discredited , super-rich elite			2
celebration : @entity12 ' supporters go wild after he won the opposition presidential primary election in @entity65 , @entity3 , on sunday the most furious accusations have come from state media commentator @entity67 , who often targets @entity2 's foes on his late night tv show , @entity69			1
@entity67 insulted opposition leaders and then read out a purported police document reporting @entity12 was caught in a car having sex with another man in 2000			1
@entity12 denied the allegation and said the document was falsified			1
another state radio commentator , @entity78 , wrote a vitriolic profile of @entity12 , highlighting his @entity9 family background and titled @entity81 is @entity82			1
@entity12 , a practicing @entity83 , has not responded to the profile			1
one cartoon , retweeted today by a senior @entity2 aide , showed @entity12 in pink shorts with a @entity88 on his arm , squaring up to a much larger , muscular @entity2			1
he often talks emotionally of his grandparents ' escape from @entity93 repression			0
@entity12 comes from a wealthy family but pointedly spends more time in a t - shirt in shantytowns than in his office , and he is seeking to project himself as above the mud - slinging			1
there is a way : @entity12 won nearly two - thirds of the 3 million votes cast in sunday 's primary @entity12 , who won nearly two - thirds of the 3 million votes cast in sunday 's primary , said : ' i was n't elected to fight with anyone but to solve problems			1
' the only confrontation i want is against violence , unemployment , corruption and other problems in @entity3			0
' much of the official ire against @entity12 has focused on sunday 's primary , saying the overall numbers were inflated to give an impression of massive opposition turnout - even though the state electoral authority supervised the poll			1
@entity2 ’s 14 - year - old daughter @entity118 sparked outrage last month when she posted a picture of herself online peering out from behind a wad of dollars			0
@entity123 , @entity124 and other social media sites seethed with resentment from people who said they had been unable to change bolívares , the local currency , because of government limits on the amount of dollars that can be bought at the official , fixed rate			0
some @entity123 users mocked her photo by taking photos of themselves flaunting everyday items , calling the craze # rosinesing			0
others contrasted the image of @entity141 peeking behind the bills with her father 's rhetoric against capitalism and consumerism			0
some satirised the photo by substituting the dollars for cooking oil , coffee , sugar and other staples that occasionally become scarce in @entity3			0
the photo is the second time @entity155 has made headlines for allegedly flaunting her family 's lavish lifestyle , the first being when she posted a photo of herself meeting pop star @entity160			0
critics claimed this showed a glimpse of the family 's exalted lifestyle			0
@entity2 supporters have also demanded to know the source of @entity12 ' campaign financing , implying @entity170 interests have been backing him			1
the @entity15 candidate has responded that his books are open for all to see			1
adding to the charged atmosphere , the @entity173 ordered the opposition yesterday not to burn voter registration books from sunday 's vote - a measure they had promised to counter fears there could be retribution			2
the government for years discriminated against @entity3 whose names were on a list of people who requested a recall referendum on @entity2 's rule , blocking them from jobs , state loans and in some cases even entrance to government buildings			0
opposition leaders said the court 's order was issued too late , and the lists of voters ' names had already been burned			0
@entity12 has criticised one - sided coverage by state media , accusing it of routinely ignoring protests about crime and water shortages while extensively reporting ' every time a mango falls on a roof ' in the state of @entity206 where he is governor			2
he travelled to the @entity208 island of @entity209 yesterday to visit a shrine and give thanks for his primary victory			2
@entity12 says his religious conviction grew during four months in jail in 2004 after a riot outside the @entity217 embassy which he was accused - but later acquitted - of fomenting			2
analysts say the finally united opposition - which in the past has been crippled by in - fighting and failed to dislodge @entity2 via mass street protests or a string of votes - has its best chance in 13 years of unseating him in october			0
yet the president still appears to have the edge , thanks to high popularity among the poor , a formidable party machine and an extraordinary pre-election spending spree on welfare projects like allowances for single mothers and pensioners			0
recent polls show @entity2 would win about 60 per cent of the vote in october , though analysts say that could change if @entity12 runs a dynamic campaign			1
he plans to start a tour of @entity3 from next week			0
the @entity243 political risk consultancy said @entity12 was a competitive candidate because he was young , less connected to the country 's old political class and the governor of an important state who enjoyed high approval ratings			2
' we do n't think this will be enough to defeat @entity2 , but it points to the fact that the election could be tighter than most anticipate , and that there could be some volatility in terms of expectations in the run up to the election , ' it said .			0

@entity12 , 39 , won @entity15 primary election on sunday
@entity265 claims he was caught in car having sex with another man in 2000
torrent of abuse started just minuted after landslide victory
indicates fight for october 7 presidential election will be ' rough '
