by @entity0 published : 16:46 est , 4 october 2013 updated : 17:53 est , 4 october 2013 the @entity2 's finish area will again fill with spectators , some carrying bags			1
more bomb - sniffing dogs also will be roaming around			0
less than seven months after the attack on the @entity10 , runners and fans will pack the streets of @entity13 's five boroughs next month			0
the increased security will be unmistakable , from barriers around @entity16 to added checkpoints			2
marathon organizer @entity19 , though , decided it would be impractical to ban bags from the finish area			1
spectators are encouraged to bring no more than one per person , no larger than the size of a purse			1
safeguards : organizers of the @entity2 have announced they will be upping security at finish line come november 3			1
above , a picture of the finish line at 2009 's race when @entity19 president @entity36 describes the race - day scene the group wants to celebrate , it 's the same qualities that make the massive event vulnerable			1
' it is that intersection of spectator and neighbor and volunteer and the runners of @entity13 and from around the world , and everybody coming out cheering for each other , inspiring each other , that makes it the marathon , ' @entity36 said thursday , a month before the november 3 race			1
for a major marathon in the @entity56 , those images are , for now , distant memories			2
last year 's @entity2 never happened			1
the damage from @entity59 forced its cancellation , but not before many @entity13 decried city and race officials ' initial plans to go on with the event			1
and not before thousands of entrants from around the world flew to the city , encouraged by those first assurances that the race was on			0
back on the road : last year the marathon was cancelled due to the damage caused by @entity59			1
above , marathoners cross the @entity74 into @entity75 then on april 15 in @entity77 , two bombs exploded near the finish line , killing three people and injuring more than 260			1
less than 24 hours after the bombings , @entity19 staffers met			0
they vowed not to scale down the size and spectacle of their race that so appeal to fans and runners alike			0
@entity19 's operations team later spent two days huddling with its counterparts at the @entity77 and @entity91 marathons ( @entity91 's race is october 13 )			0
the organization also hired an outside consulting firm to audit its security practices and shifted some personnel from general logistics to security matters , said @entity99 , the race 's technical director			2
key staffers and volunteers will receive new training in emergency management			0
the 2001 marathon took place less than two months after the september 11 attacks , so security has been heightened ever since			1
now it will be tightened even more			0
never again : the increased security is being put in place in light of the bombings at the @entity10 finish line last april securing the start at @entity116 is straightforward because of its location â€” @entity119			1
the bridges on the race course are similarly restrictive			0
but the finish is in @entity16 , a sprawling public space			2
barriers will be erected around it , and people can enter only through a few designated checkpoints where bags will be searched			2
there will be additional checkpoints to reach the marathon course			2
@entity36 said banning bags from the bleachers around the finish area was considered , but organizers decided spectators needed to carry clothing and provisions for themselves and the runners they plan to meet afterward			1
runners will be prohibited from wearing hydration vests			0
brothers in crime : above , surveillance footage near the finish line of last year 's @entity10 shows alleged bombers @entity146 , left , and @entity148 , right , @entity149			1
investigators say they hid their ieds in their backpacks security along the course will be handled by the police			0
@entity157 spokesman @entity156 did n't want to go into details thursday			0
' we will advise of traffic conditions , road closures and security measures at the appropriate time , closer to the event , ' he said			2
@entity36 said @entity19 had heard little concern from entrants about security risks			0
and the ire many runners expressed about the handling of last year 's cancellation seems to have cooled with time and the announcement of the refund and guaranteed entry options .			0

the organizers of the event have bumped up security following the @entity179 last april
the @entity2 will be held on november 3
bags will be allowed at the finish line , but only one per person and they ca n't be larger than a purse
last year , the marathon was cancelled following the *destruction* caused by @entity59
