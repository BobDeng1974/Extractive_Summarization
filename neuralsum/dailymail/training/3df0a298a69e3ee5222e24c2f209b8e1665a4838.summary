living in fear of a partner or family member does not stop over @entity3 it ’s a time for family gatherings , celebrations and present - giving			1
however , excessive alcohol consumption and money worries over @entity3 contribute to a peak period for domestic abuse			1
for thousands of women , men and children up and down the country , the festive period remains a time where their own home is not safe			1
living in fear of a partner or family member does not stop over @entity3 , and statistics reveal incidences of domestic violence increase over the holidays			1
during the last quarter of 2013 , there was a 15.5 per cent rise in victims suffering abuse at home			2
and it is estimated that one in four women will experience domestic violence in their lifetime			1
in the @entity36 , two women are killed every week by a current or ex-partner , and many police forces across the @entity36 see a spike in reports around @entity3			1
@entity41 , chief executive of national domestic violence charity refuge , says : ' @entity3 can be an incredibly difficult time for women and children experiencing domestic violence			1
‘ @entity3 is meant to be a time of joy , a time of generosity , a time of caring			1
but for too many women and children , the 25th december will be yet another day of living with fear , intimidation and violence			1
' the physical , economic , and psychological abuse suffered by victims of domestic violence can make it incredibly difficult for victims to leave			1
@entity57 * , 35 , explains how she was a ‘ successful , independent businesswoman ’ when she first met her ex-husband @entity58 , who started being violent to her when she fell pregnant			1
' i was n't sure about him at first , but he pursued me relentlessly , charming me with gifts , flowers and surprise trips abroad , ’ she said			2
@entity3 is a peak time for domestic violence , according to statistics ' he was at the top of his profession and he bowled me over			1
' he wanted to get married and have children straight away			2
it was exciting and romantic - i thought i had met the love of my life			2
' it 's only now , looking at back at the whole picture that i can see that this was controlling behaviour and his inability to take no for an answer			2
' after we had moved in together , he kept starting arguments			2
i put it down to the stress he was under at work			2
@entity41 , chief executive of national domestic violence charity refuge , says : ' every couple has arguments and disagreements – we all say and do things we later regret			1
' domestic violence is systematic , purposeful and patterned behaviour designed to control another person			1
' if a woman is forced to change her behaviour because she is frightened of her partner 's reaction , then she is being abused			1
' domestic violence can be physical , emotional , psychological , financial or sexual			1
' abuse tends to become more frequent and more severe over time ; even if you are not being hit , you may still be being abused			1
if your partner is excessively jealous or possessive , or if he controls where you go , who you speak to , how you dress or wear your hair , these are all warning signs of domestic violence			1
' ‘ we had been together for about a year when one of these rows ended with him threatening me with a kitchen knife			2
‘ i decided to leave him , but when he agreed to go to relationship counselling , i gave him another chance			2
' like many abusers , @entity58 began isolating @entity57 and making her economically reliant on him , encouraging her to leave the business that she ran with a colleague			2
she said : ' the moment the business had a bad time he was encouraging me to sell up and leave it , promising he would take care of me and support me			2
‘ there were subtle pressures to force me under his economic control and take away my independence			2
’ ' the next year , we got married and i fell pregnant			1
that was when the violence started			1
' we were arguing after we had missed our flight for a holiday			0
suddenly he hit me and threw me across the room			1
' as with many cases of abuse , the violence outburst was not a one - off , and @entity58 became increasingly abusive towards @entity57			1
' throughout the pregnancy , i had to explain away the bruises from his punches and kicks			0
i told the midwife i had fallen down the stairs , ’ she said			0
' anything could set off a violent outburst from @entity58			0
i was constantly walking on eggshells			0
' but whenever i tried to leave , he would reel me back in , telling me that he would change and that he wanted us to be a family			0
’ emotionally manipulated and abused by @entity58 , @entity57 felt unable to leave him and isolated from friends and family			0
arguments can often happen in front of the children - and escalate out of control ' they [ abusers ] are very clever			0
he made me believe it was things i was doing wrong that was setting him off			0
' after the birth of our second child he had a massive falling out with my family and gave me an ultimatum ; him or them			0
we had just had a baby and i was desperate to keep the family together			0
so i was totally alone			0
' the violence was sporadic and i began to question whether i was causing it			1
i did n't have the term domestic abuse in my head at all			1
‘ it sounds silly but i thought domestic abuse meant having a black eye			1
because i was n't turning up at the school gate covered in bruises everyday it was n't domestic violence			1
' despite his promises to change , @entity58 became worse after the birth of the couple 's second child			0
for more information visit @entity189 ' one day a normal conversation suddenly turned into a frenzied attack , ’ @entity57 explained			0
‘ he punched me to the ground , kicked me in the back , and then threw me across the room - all in front of our two - year - old and the baby			2
' it was only after this incident in the presence of the children that @entity57 called the police			0
however , it took several more attacks and calls to the emergency services before @entity57 found the strength to leave permanently , getting legal help to set up restraining orders			2
' the police were not very supportive , it was like they were just ticking things off their check list and rolling their eyes , ’ she said			0
' eventually the police put me in touch with @entity219			0
one of their outreach workers , @entity222 * , started helping me			2
' the very act of being believed allowed everything to just come pouring out			0
' we talked about everything i had been through and she helped me to understand that @entity58 's behaviour was all about power and control			0
just that initial emotional support was so important			0
' but then she also calmly helped talked me through the practicalities , navigating the next stage			0
with her support , i made a plan to stay safe			0
' @entity222 supported me as i went through the divorce and child contact proceedings			0
thanks to her i was able to start rebuilding my life away from @entity58			0
' i was devastated when the crown prosecution service said there was n't enough evidence to prosecute him , but i have had to move on			0
' now things are so much better			0
it is n't easy to break away from a violent partner ; i do n't think i could have done it without @entity219 's support			2
‘ i would urge anyone who is living with fear and intimidation at home to visit @entity219 's website and find out more - you are not alone and there is life on the other side of domestic violence			1
' @entity41 , chief executive of national domestic violence charity refuge , said : ' people often ask , “ why do women stay with violent men ? ”			1
' the answer is complicated			0
there are a huge number of practical and psychological barriers to leaving an abusive partner			2
' victims of domestic violence are frequently isolated by their abusers : systematically cut off from friends and family			1
it can be incredibly hard for women to reach out for help in situations like this			0
if a woman is forced to change her behaviour because she is frightened of her partner then she is being abused			1
this list may help you to identify whether you are experiencing domestic violence : ' the grinding impact of emotional abuse can chip away at a woman 's sense of self			1
she may begin to believe her abuser when he tells her , day in , day out , that she is worthless , that no - one will believe her , that no - one cares about her but him			0
' abusers manipulate their victims carefully and purposefully ; they switch readily between charm and rage , like @entity297 and mr @entity297			0
' @entity298 can be a paralysing force : many women stay with their abusers because they are terrified of what will happen if they leave			0
this is a well - founded fear			0
domestic violence takes a staggering death toll , killing two women every week , and the vast majority of domestic homicides happen when a woman is trying to separate from her abuser			1
' some women may not be able to support themselves and their children financially on their own			0
refuges and other support services are being closed across the country as a result of ongoing funding cuts – reducing the number of escape routes available to women and children			0
' domestic violence will not end unless we stop asking “ why does she stay ? ” and instead ask the right questions : “ why does he abuse ? ” and “ what can we do as a society to end domestic violence once and for all ? ”			1
