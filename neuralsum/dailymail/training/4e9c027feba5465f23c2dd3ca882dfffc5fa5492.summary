a ' wonder ' paint made from graphene could banish rust forever , scientists claim			2
by combining it with oxygen they say they can create graphene oxide that , when applied as paint , provides an ultra-strong and non-corrosive coating			1
and the breakthrough could apparently revolutionise the medical , nuclear and even transport industries			1
scientists at @entity14 say @entity15 can be combined with oxygen to create graphene oxide and then applied as paint ( stock image shown )			1
this provides an ultra-strong , non-corrosive coat to metals , bricks and more			1
when exposed to water vapour the paint acts as a ' molecular sieve ' graphene is a one atom thick sheet of carbon that has often been heralded as a ' miracle material '			1
this latest study by scientists from @entity14 created coatings for metals or even bricks that behave like graphite in terms of chemical and thermal stability			1
but they also become mechanically nearly as tough as graphene , the strongest material known to be in existence today			0
the team led by dr @entity43 and @entity45 laureate sir @entity44 demonstrated previously that multilayer films made from graphene oxide are vacuum tight under dry conditions			2
graphene is the world 's thinnest substance , transparent but stronger than steel - a conductive super-material made of carbon just one atom thick			0
there is a surge of interest in it to replace semiconductors in next - generation computers , touch screens , batteries and solar cells			0
graphene was aired as a theoretical substance in 1947			0
but for decades , physicists thought it would be impossible to isolate , as such thin crystalline sheets were bound to be unstable			0
the problem was resolved in 2004 by a pair of scientists who used ordinary sticky tape to lift a layer from a piece of graphite			0
that layer was itself pulled apart using more tape , and the process repeated until just the thinnest of layers remained - a graphene sheet			0
if exposed to water or its vapour however they act as molecular sieves , allowing passage of small molecules below a certain size			2
the findings could also have huge implications for water purification			0
this contrasting property is due to the structure of graphene oxide films that consist of millions of small flakes stacked randomly on top of each other but leave nano - sized capillaries between them			2
water molecules inside these nanocapillaries and can drag small atoms and molecules along			0
in an article published in @entity106 , the team showed it was possible to tightly close those nanocapillaries using simple chemical treatments , which makes graphene films even stronger mechanically as well as completely impermeable to everything : gases , liquids or strong chemicals			0
for example , they demonstrated that glassware or copper plates covered with graphene paint can be used as containers for strongly corrosive acids			1
@entity15 ( artist 's illustration shown ) is the world 's thinnest substance , transparent but stronger than steel - a conductive super-material made of carbon just one atom thick			0
there is a surge of interest in it to replace semiconductors in next - generation computers , touch screens , batteries and solar cells the exceptional barrier properties of graphene paint have already attracted interest from many companies who now collaborate with the @entity14 on development of new protective and anticorrosion coatings			1
dr @entity43 said : ' graphene paint has a good chance to become a truly revolutionary product for industries that deal with any kind of protection either from air , weather elements or corrosive chemicals			1
' those include , for example , medical , electronics and nuclear industry or even shipbuilding , to name but the few			0
' another author on the research dr @entity163 added : ' graphene paint can be applied to practically any material , independently of whether it 's plastic , metal or even sand			1
' for example , plastic films coated with graphene could be of interest for medical packaging to improve shelf life because they are less permeable to air and water vapour than conventional coatings			1
in addition , thin layers of graphene paint are optically transparent			2
