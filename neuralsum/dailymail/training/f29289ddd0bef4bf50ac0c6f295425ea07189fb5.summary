@entity0 are employing the international pr agency — @entity2 — used by @entity3 2018 ’s doomed @entity5 bid to crisis manage the build - up to the next global tournament in @entity9 in 2018			1

@entity34 select committee chairman @entity32 has asked the @entity35 to answer ‘ serious ’ questions about the intelligence			0
but @entity0 have no qualms employing @entity2 , who were willing to take on the difficult brief — especially with the @entity9 - @entity42 situation — after some rivals pulled out			1
@entity0 fancifully first described their outside - agency recruitment as purely involving brand assistance			2
but it is all about damage limitation around the @entity5 in @entity9			2
world champion @entity48 , who has split with @entity51 ’s @entity50 , is not expected to sign for another @entity53 management team			1
he will rely on himself and his lawyer to negotiate his next multi-million pound driving contract with @entity56 and on specialist consultants in other areas			0
@entity48 celebrated with the @entity59 after winning in @entity60 to clinch the world title the @entity62 like to look after their own , judging by their £ 280,000 funding of a new , three - court indoor tennis facility at exclusive @entity68 public school @entity66 ’s in leafy @entity69 — hardly an inner - city area deprived of tennis facilities			2
the grand opening last week featured an exhibition match between @entity66 ’s old boy @entity74 and @entity75			0
current pupil @entity76 — 12 - year - old son of former @entity62 chief executive @entity77 and a highly promising @entity79 junior — had a hit with the two stars			0
the @entity62 say the investment in further improving @entity66 ’s high - performance tennis centre was made during @entity76 ’s regime			0
they add there is now a new strategy in place under @entity88 that scrutinises every facility spend in far more detail			0
@entity92 personnel ca n’t seem to help making inappropriate comments on social media , despite the huge annoyance of their bosses			1
presenter @entity97 , who hosted @entity92 ’s sports women of the year awards , posted a studio photograph of himself and colleague @entity101 on @entity102 with the message : ‘ discussing tactics ahead of tonight — @entity106 , you distract the ugly one , i ’ll move in on her fit mate			2
’ regular @entity92 freelance @entity109 , who boasts about her serial swearing on @entity111 , told her followers : ‘ f * * * * * * * @entity113 has left my luggage in @entity115			2
’ @entity92 ' @entity97 is one of host of presenters who have made inappropriate comments @entity120 wins by a head the contrast is extraordinary in the way @entity120 owners have been embraced by @entity3 horse racing — to the extent the @entity127 take tea with the @entity129 at @entity130 while also bankrolling yesterday ’s glitzy @entity132 annual awards			1
at the polar opposite is @entity3 football ’s widespread mistrust of the way @entity120 won the bid to stage the 2202 @entity5			1
the best grace and favour house in @entity79 sport has to be the 10 - bedroom lodge at @entity130 complete with expansive garden			0

the @entity148 is going to be utilised for corporate hospitality			0
@entity32 recently wrote to @entity35 chairman @entity150 for clarification from the governing body @entity32 , chairman of the @entity34 select committee , surprised his own government department when he demanded the @entity35 explain the blindingly obvious — why they did n’t include hearsay , rumour and gossip but kept to proven facts in their fully co-operative response to the @entity5 bid corruption investigation			1
