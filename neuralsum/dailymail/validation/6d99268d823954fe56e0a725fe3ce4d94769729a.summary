there 's an old adage - if you want something done right , do it yourself			0
well , that was certainly the case for @entity8 player - manager @entity7			0
with his side 2 - 1 down in the second - half to @entity11 and @entity12 in the @entity13 , defeat was looking likely			2
@entity7 though , was n't prepared to just stand back and take one ; so , in a bold tactical move , the 37 - year - old subbed himself into the game , and minutes later , he scored an equalising goal with a header from a corner			1
@entity8 player - manager @entity7 comes on as a sub to score an equalising goal for his side @entity7 's header makes the score 2 - 2 between @entity8 and @entity11 and @entity28 as if that was n't incredible enough , when the @entity8 goalkeeper was forced off the field with injury and with no replacement available from the bench , @entity7 stepped into his position			1
amazingly , he managed not to concede , even after his side gave away a clumsy penalty in the 81st minute			0
@entity7 guessed correctly and saved the shot to keep @entity8 in it at 2 - 2			2
the @entity39 would then go on to score a late winner and @entity7 has since become a viral sensation			0
after an injury to the @entity8 goalkeeper , @entity7 went in goal and had to face an 81st minute penalty amazingly , the 37 - year - old managed to save the shot and keep the scores level , before @entity8 nicked a winner			1

@entity8 boss @entity7 made a very *effective* substitution
the 37 - year - old brought himself on to score an equaliser with @entity8 2 - 1 down
after an injury to the @entity8 goalkeeper , @entity7 then went in goal
he managed to make a *superb* penalty save to keep the scores at 2 - 2
@entity8 would go on to beat @entity11 and @entity12 3 - 2
