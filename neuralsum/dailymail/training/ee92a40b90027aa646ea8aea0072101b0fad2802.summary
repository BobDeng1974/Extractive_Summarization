the couple did not know about mr @entity8 's epilepsy			1
the inquest heard the four were travelling along @entity39 , @entity15 when they approached the ' give way ' junction leading onto the @entity14 on 10 june last year			2
but mr @entity8 failed to stop or turn and instead carried straight on , narrowly missing two cyclists before hitting a wall straight ahead			1
@entity43 told the inquest that he had noticed a change in his friend 's behaviour prior to the crash			2
he said : ' i was aware that he had become somewhat non-responsive			0
he accelerated and was driving faster than you would normally think appropriate but then slowed down and all seemed to be well again			0
then he accelerated inappropriately when he came up to the junction			0
' in reference to his epilepsy , mr @entity8 told the court : ' i obviously should have contacted the @entity10 but i do not remember anyone ever mentioning it			1
' scene of the crash : the court heard mr @entity8 failed to stop at a junction and drove straight into a wall in @entity15 , @entity16 mrs @entity63 told the inquest at @entity65 : ' the epilepsy goes back to the 1980s , and was dealt with by medication , after which his seizures were rare			1
' she mentioned an occasion where he was playing squash and blacked out , leading to an overnight stay in hospital			0
@entity75 , a collision investigator for @entity76 , said all the evidence pointed to mr @entity8 having some sort of seizure before the tragedy			1
a spokesman for @entity76 said that after discussion with the cps and medical experts a decision taken not to prosecute mr @entity8			1
' we have written to the family of the victim to explain our decision and offer our condolences			0
' @entity91 , @entity92 and @entity16 coroner , said the accident highlights the potential danger of taking to the wheel after being diagnosed with conditions such as epilepsy			0
he recorded a verdict of accidental death and said he would be writing to the @entity10 and @entity101			2
' i will write about the apparent lack of importance put on notifying the @entity10 about medical conditions , ' he said			2
' i think doctors ought to take an active stance in relation to anyone who may have a problem and should also be required to notify the @entity10			2
' explaining the decision not to prosecute mr @entity8 , a @entity83 spokesperson said : ' there was clear medical evidence that the suspect suffered an epileptic seizure and was not in control of the vehicle at the time of the crash			1
@entity120 is a defence to the charges of causing death by dangerous driving , dangerous driving , causing death by careless driving and careless driving			0
as such , we concluded that none of these charges could be brought			0
' the defence of automatism would not apply if the suspect had driven with the knowledge that there was a real risk of a seizure , but blood tests confirmed that he had been taking his medication as appropriate , so he was fit to drive , and there is often no indication in advance that a seizure will take place			0
it could not be proved that the suspect had willingly driven dangerously			0
' we also considered whether the suspect should be charged for failing to notify the @entity10 about his condition , which is punishable by up to a £ 1,000 fine			0
there was sufficient evidence to prove this offence but we concluded that it would not be in the public interest to proceed as this offence will not be repeated ( the suspect ’s licence was revoked ) , the driver was unaware of the need to notify the @entity10 and the victim ’s family did not support a prosecution .			0
