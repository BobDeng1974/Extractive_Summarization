there 's nothing like the presence of some @entity3 to ruin a perfectly good party			1
on tuesday night , the comedian @entity5 was thrown out of @entity7 ’s @entity6 after - show for making jibes about the event ’s sponsor , @entity11 , and the fashion company ’s historic links to the @entity4			1
while on stage , @entity5 told the gathered celebrities and politicians , ‘ if anyone knows a bit about history and fashion , you know it was @entity11 who made uniforms for the @entity3			1
’ he then added , with less than subtle irony , ‘ but they looked f * * * ing fantastic , let ’s face it , while they were killing people on the basis of their religion and sexuality			1
’ but it has emerged that @entity5 himself is not averse to a spot of the designer 's sharp tailoring - having apparently been snapped wearing a jacket by the @entity40 fashion firm in february			1
according to the comedian ’s @entity55 feed , the two men exchanged angry words , with @entity51 saying , ‘ what you did was very offensive to @entity11			1
’ brand replied , ‘ what @entity11 did was very offensive to the @entity61			1
’ although @entity11 has made no public comment , its executives are doubtless furious , not least because the £ 250,000 spent sponsoring the event seems to have bought nothing but another round of bad publicity about the company ’s past			1
of course , @entity5 ’s claim is not new — such stories about the fashion label ’s murky past have been doing the rounds for years			0
after the war he was punished as a @entity4 supporter			0
he died in 1948 but the connection between @entity11 and the @entity3 has been peddled so often , and with so many variations , that the true story is almost completely obscured			1
brand ’s outburst this week provides a perfect opportunity to set the record straight			1
the first myth to torpedo is that @entity11 designed the smart black uniforms for the dreaded @entity87 although it is tempting to suppose that the evil glamour of these outfits must have been the product of a fashion designer , there is no truth to it at all			1
in fact , the uniforms evolved from earlier @entity99 styles			0
the designs continued to evolve with modifications from the foundation of the @entity87 in 1925 to its disintegration two decades later			0
the infamous black uniform itself came into being in 1932 and is said to have been designed by an artist and senior ss officer called @entity108 , who worked with a graphic designer called @entity110			0
neither man worked for @entity11			1
so , if @entity5 was implying , as i infer from his remarks , that @entity11 created the @entity4 uniforms , he is plain wrong			1
perhaps @entity5 meant that @entity11 simply manufactured them			2
in which case he ’s right			0
but there ’s more to it than that			0
to answer the question fully , it is vital to know a little more about @entity11 himself			2
@entity11 was born in 1885 , to parents who owned a lingerie and linen shop in the small town of @entity127 , 20 miles south of @entity128			2
after serving in @entity129 , @entity11 established his own clothes factory in 1924 , which produced traditional outfits			1
it was certainly not designing couture , and its clothes , such as raincoats and sportswear , were functional			0
among one of @entity11 ’s earliest clients was a textiles distributor called @entity140 , which commissioned @entity11 to produce some brown shirts for an organisation called the ‘ @entity143 ’ , later , to become better known as the @entity3			1
style : @entity11 is now a global fashion powerhouse by the @entity146 , the growing @entity4 had become a good client			2
and when the party supplied @entity11 ( as it did other manufacturers ) the production templates for its uniforms , it appears that @entity11 did not see the relationship in anything but commercial terms			1
after all , @entity11 produced uniforms for many organisations , including the police and the postal service , and the apparently apolitical @entity11 was happy to make clothes for whoever paid their bills			1
however , on april 1 , 1931 , @entity11 took a step that would see his name — and brand — forever associated with @entity165			1
he joined the @entity4 and was given the relatively low membership number of 508,889			0
@entity11 ’s reasons for becoming a @entity4 comparatively early were twofold			1
first , as a businessman , it made commercial sense , as it made it easier for @entity11 to win contracts from the @entity3 who were increasingly coming to dominate every aspect of @entity40 life			1
second , @entity11 believed that @entity176 was the only man who could lift @entity40 out of its economic doldrums			2
such a businesslike attitude was not exceptional			0
there were certainly better men who refused to do business with the party , but though @entity11 was happy to sign contracts with them , he was not a rabid @entity4			2
he was simply a pragmatist			0
dubious : @entity11 became a @entity4 as it made it easier for him to win contracts partly thanks to his membership of the party , the @entity3 were good to boss			1
by 1933 , he was able to advertise that he made clothes not only for the @entity87 , but also for the @entity192 and the @entity193 — the paramilitary wing of the @entity4			2
then in 1938 , business skyrocketed when @entity11 won contracts to make army uniforms			1
by 1940 , the company was turning over some @entity199 , compared to 200,000 reichsmarks in 1936			0
however , it was still far from being a major manufacturer			0
in 1940 , @entity11 was employing some 250 workers , which made it a small to medium - sized firm			1
like many , @entity11 found it hard to find employees during the war , and this is where the story does turn truly dark			2
brand was kicked out of the awards after making the comments about @entity11 's links to the @entity3 unable to fill roles , the company found itself employing forced workers from the occupied countries			1
during the course of the war , @entity11 used 140 such labourers and for a period of around eight months from october 1940 , the workforce was swelled by 40 @entity227 prisoners - of - war			1
although @entity11 ’s factory was not part of a concentration camp — and his labourers were not prisoners — the conditions were dreadful			1
one former boss labourer , a 17 - year - old @entity235 called @entity236 , was forced to work in the factory from 1942 to 1945			0
he recalls the hygiene being very poor			0
‘ in the barracks there were lice and fleas			0
’ he describes the food as insufficient given the hours they had to work			0
during air raids , the workforce was not allowed into shelters , but had to stay in the factory			0
another labourer , @entity249 , recalls being rounded up the @entity250 from her town in @entity252 in april 1940 , and forced to work at @entity11 at the age of 19			2
she remembers the medical facilities as woeful			0
‘ there was no special treatment for children and pregnant women , ’ she says , ‘ and there was no way to visit a doctor			0
if we had a disease , we had to treat ourselves			0
’ the most poignant story is that of a @entity252 woman called @entity265 , who was sent to work at @entity11 in october 1941			1
in december , @entity265 fled back home to help her father raise her siblings , but she was captured by the @entity250 and sent to @entity269 and @entity270 , where she was dreadfully beaten			0
however , when @entity11 found out where she was , he used his contacts in the @entity4 to get her returned to @entity127			2
although his motivation for trying to save her is n’t clear , he did seem to feel some responsibility for his workforce			0
but when she returned , the factory foreman worked her mercilessly , and she had a breakdown			0
@entity265 was finally given three months ’ leave , and allowed to see a doctor , but on 5 july 1943 , she gassed herself with an oven			2
boss then did an almost unprecedented thing : he paid for the funeral expenses , as well as travel costs for her family to attend			0
though this was a noble gesture , it would have been more decent and caring for @entity11 to have ensured his forced labourers were treated more humanely in the first place			2
still , by the standards of some employers , @entity11 did treat his labourers reasonably well — and paid them somewhat less meanly			2
after the war , @entity11 was ‘ de-nazified ’			1
he was classified as an active supporter of @entity165 , was fined 100,000 marks , and was stripped of the right to vote and run a business			0
however , @entity11 appealed , and he was eventually classified as a ‘ follower ’ , a lesser category , which meant that he was not regarded as an active promoter of @entity165			1
@entity11 died in 1948 , but his business has lived on , albeit still stained by its association with @entity165			2
in 1999 , the company finally agreed to contribute to a fund that compensated former forced labourers			0
the true story of @entity11 , his firm and its relationship with the @entity3 , is rather less straightforward than @entity5 would have it			1
he certainly did not design the @entity87 uniforms , though he did produce them			0
it is , however , shameful that @entity11 , like so many other manufacturers , used forced labourers from occupied countries			2
ultimately , @entity11 was not an evil man , but he did not do enough to stop evil happening			0
that is an important distinction and may not be one appreciated by a man as unsubtle as @entity5 .			0

brand was thrown out of @entity7 ’s @entity6 after - show
he told crowds : ' it was @entity11 who made uniforms for the @entity3 . ’
but pictures have emerged of him wearing designer 's clothes months *ago*
