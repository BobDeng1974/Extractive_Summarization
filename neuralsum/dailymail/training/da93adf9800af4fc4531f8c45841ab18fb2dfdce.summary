photoshoots are complicated at the best of times			2
you often have little time to get the perfect shot and there are so many moving parts			0
so imagine throwing 99 primary school children into the mix. and then deciding to put them all in @entity11 shirts surrounding @entity12			1
this was going to be a challenge			0
putting the kids in shirts rather than caps – as we did when we took a similar picture for @entity21 ’s 100th cap – was a fairly late decision			1
that gave us just a couple of days to find and get 99 shirts to @entity26			1
of course we wanted the kids to be able to keep them too			0
@entity12 with 99 schoolkids all wearing @entity11 shirts donated by @entity30 three of the children dressed in their @entity11 shirts signed by the captain ahead of his 100th cap the 99 children listened as @entity12 returned to where his education - and footballing journey - all began a big thanks goes to @entity40 for providing the @entity42 @entity11 kits for the shoot			1
for more info go to @entity45 we tried a lot of shops but getting the right sizes and delivery in time proved impossible			0
we needed half red and half white too to make the perfect picture and that was an added challenge			0
step in , @entity54 at the last minute with a phone call that rescued the shoot and stopped us from having to disappoint the brilliant people at @entity59 and @entity61 's @entity60 – and @entity12			1
they agreed to provide all the kits and managed to send them up from their base in @entity67 in @entity68 in time for the shoot			2
after that it was the crazy game of organising all the shirts into colours and sizes and getting the right children in the right tops			2
we laid them all out on tables in the formation we wanted and then the kids filed in and put on the right tops			0
the hardest part ? making sure the kids stayed in the right order as they filed into the gym for the photo			0
luckily , they were incredibly well behaved , looked fantastic in their tops and got them all signed by @entity12 at the end			1
a day they will never forget			0
