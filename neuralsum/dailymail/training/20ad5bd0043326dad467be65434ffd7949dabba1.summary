@entity8 is the place to feel happy : seven of the top 10 countries in the well - being poll hailed from the @entity18 , with @entity19 rounding out the top 10			1
six of the 10 worst were from @entity22 the five elements of the poll were : purpose - liking what you do each day and being motivated to achieve your goals ; social - having supportive relationships and love in your life ; financial - managing your economic life to reduce stress and increase security ; community - liking where you live , feeling safe , and having pride in your community ; and physical - having good health and enough energy to get things done daily			1

adults in @entity8 were found most likely to be thriving , with six of the world 's top 10 coming from the region , which was in keeping with a previous @entity51 poll which found them to have the most positive outlook on life			1

more surprisingly , @entity98 and @entity99 were also very low down the list			0
the results of the poll also showed how people 's perceptions could sometimes differ from reality - for instance , @entity101 and @entity102 both came in the top 10 for physical well - being , despite being two of the world 's most obese nations			1
this comes largely down to a lack of education about health			0

just 18 per cent of people internationally considered themselves to be thriving in terms of their sense of purpose , while in @entity135 and the @entity136 and @entity22 , it was just 13 per cent			2

the @entity4 ranked 15th for social well - being , 18th for sense of purpose , 21st for financial well - being and 25th for both physical well - being and community			1
@entity51 - @entity51 research has shown that those have a higher well - being rating are happier , healthier , work better and are more able to recover from problems than those with a low ranking			0
