@entity1 @entity0 : bishops should ' highlight moral questions which underpin debate ' @entity6 bishops will today urge 4million worshippers to vote for political candidates who promote marriage			1
cardinal @entity10 will say that stable families and help for the frail and elderly are key planks in advice about the general election for the church ’s five million @entity17 followers			1
the right reverend @entity0 , @entity1 , said yesterday : ‘ no - one expects bishops to offer a political programme at election time but to highlight the moral questions which underpin the public debate			1
' faced with the unprecedented scale of family breakdown and its immense human and social costs , this election debate surely can not ignore support for marriage			0
' at the very foundation of society is respect for the sanctity of human life			0
we must n’t forget the newly - elected parliament in 2015 will decide the legality of assisted suicide in our hospitals and care homes with far - reaching consequences for the way society regards the sick and the elderly			0
' it contrasts with the widely - criticised manifesto by @entity50 bishops last week which made no mention of marriage			1
instead the @entity50 said families could best by helped by outside organisations like housing associations or credit unions			2
nor did the @entity50 bishops choose to remind voters of the difficulties of elderly people needing care nor the scourges of drugs and pornography			1
the @entity50 election letter was the first attempt to sway voters by the @entity50 bishops and was widely criticised for its focus on inequality and the alleged evils of the market economy , consumerism and the legacy of @entity75			1
@entity6 bishops , however , have regularly given advice to churchgoers on the central issues they should consider in advance of each general election			2
the @entity6 advice , to be launched by cardinal @entity10 , has been prepared over three months by a team of four bishops and will strongly remind voters of the need to help stabilise families			1
it comes at a time when family campaigners and some @entity90 have been calling loudly for bigger tax breaks to reward couples who marry , and an end to the tax and benefit penalties piled on mothers who choose to stay at home to raise their children			0
faith : the proposals will be launched by @entity10 , pictured centre with newly - ordained priests in 2011 a bill to legalise assisted suicide is currently being considered in the @entity105			2
the bill , put forward by former labour lord chancellor @entity107 , would allow terminally ill patients to be prescribed poison if two doctors approve			0
a small tax break for married people was introduced last week in line with a promise made by @entity115 in the 2010 @entity117 manifesto			0
the concession means married couples and civil partners who are not higher rate taxpayers will be able to transfer £ 1,000 of their tax free allowance to their spouse or partner			0
it will adde £ 3.85 a week to the incomes of 1.6 million people , but analysts believe that in practice the gain will be even less for more than a million people , because for them @entity134 benefit reforms will take away £ 2.50 of the gain			0
@entity6 bishops will distribute half a million copies of their letter to parishes .			2

advice *drafted* by bishops and launched by cardinal @entity10
@entity1 defended advice , saying it is question of morals
it comes after similar letter by @entity50 focused on inequality
