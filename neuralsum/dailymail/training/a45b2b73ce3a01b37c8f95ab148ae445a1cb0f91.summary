it was better late than never for @entity1 as he started @entity4 ’s @entity3 boot camp an hour after the rest of his team - mates on tuesday morning			1
while the majority of @entity9 ’s squad – @entity11 ’s first opponents in @entity12 on june 14 – started their first day of pre-tournament training in sunny @entity14 at 10.30am local time , @entity1 stayed indoors - perhaps the gym - before making his long - awaited appearance at 11.40am			1
holding a bottle of water as temperatures reached 80 degrees , @entity1 sauntered on to the practice grounds before doing a few laps around the perimeter of the practice pitch			0
feeling blue : @entity25 ( left ) and @entity1 sprint training : @entity1 is put through his paces late arrival : @entity1 strolls on to the training pitch at @entity4 's @entity31 complex acclimatising : the sweltering conditions in @entity4 should prepare them well for @entity12 options : @entity9 will not name his final 23 - man squad until june 2 key man : the former @entity38 striker was @entity4 's star performer at @entity39 getting shirty : the heat is too much for @entity1 as he removes his training top all smiles : the striker looks relaxed as he eventually joins in with the rest of the squad although the former @entity38 star has n’t been in great form for @entity49 this season and is regarded as ' crazy ' by most of @entity4 , there is no danger of @entity9 leaving him out of the final 23 because of his exploits at @entity39 when he and @entity25 were the major contributors to @entity4 reaching the final			1
monday ’s atmosphere at the @entity58 football ’s national technical centre in @entity31 – think @entity59 at @entity60 but a lot hotter – was full of intrigue with @entity9 ready to wait until the final deadline date of june 2 before whittling a provisional squad of 30 down to 23			2
particularly anxious are the strikers			0
former @entity66 star @entity65 is battling with @entity68 ’s leading scorer @entity67 - whose pitchside sprints on monday belied his name – and @entity71 to get on the plane with @entity1			0
@entity9 may even take them all if he takes an @entity75 like gamble			0
experienced : @entity76 striker @entity71 , 31 , is in the preliminary squad sweltering training conditions on monday were tough going – good preparation for the @entity11 clash which takes place in the jungle city of @entity83			2
@entity4 ’s 30 - man squad includes four survivors from 2006 , most notably @entity25 and goalkeeper @entity86 , and visitors to @entity31 could n’t miss two giant pictures in reception of their last @entity90 win ; the first a team line - up before they played @entity93 , the second of goalscorer @entity95 being mobbed by jubilant team - mates			1
@entity4 do n’t expect to repeat that achievement in @entity12 this summer but they will always cling to hope with wildcard @entity1 among them .			0

@entity1 starts @entity4 's *bootcamp* an hour after his team - mates
striker will be included in squad because of @entity39 *performances*
@entity9 will wait until june 2 to name his @entity90 squad
@entity4 's first @entity90 opponents are @entity11 in @entity83 on june 14
