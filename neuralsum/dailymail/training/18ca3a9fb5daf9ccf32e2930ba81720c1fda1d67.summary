when it ’s cold outside there ’s something irresistible about a warm , fluffy jumper			0
never more so than this season , as these sweaters are the height of fashion , lining the rails of every clothes shop on the @entity10 @entity9			0
some of these snuggly knits are made from cashmere , others from merino wool or mohair			0
but there is one fibre that is softer and fluffier than all the rest : angora			1
these sought - after knits are produced from the fur of the angora rabbit — giant balls of fluff with tiny faces peeking out , bred for their long , soft wool			1
it ’s warmer than wool and the fibre is also exceptionally fine — just 11 microns ( 11 thousandths of a millimetre ) in diameter — which means angora is softer than cashmere			1
it is also far cheaper than the luxury fabric , with angora jumpers on sale in @entity52 for £ 36 and scarves in @entity54 for just £ 30			1
but an investigation this week revealed these bargain knits may be coming at an immense cost to the animals that produce this fluffy angora wool			1
the images , taken at an undisclosed location in @entity62 , shows angora rabbits in cages the rabbit is bent across the woman 's knee before being trimmed of its fur using scissors animal rights group @entity71 ( @entity71 ) released a gut - wrenching exposé into the angora industry in @entity62 , which is responsible for 90 per cent of the world ’s supply of angora wool			1
investigators went to ten different angora farms and witnessed , they say , appalling abuse of animals at all ten locations			1
at half of the farms a particularly barbaric form of live plucking is used to remove the fur			2
@entity71 , which is campaigning for shoppers to boycott angora , is not naming the farms to protect its sources , but has documented its hard - hitting findings in video footage			2
be warned , neither the still images nor the video make for easy viewing			0
the woman holds the rabbit by the ears while trimming its fur at the @entity62 angora farm shocking truth : the animals are constantly injured from throughout the plucking as they struggle to break free torture : the @entity62 fur traders use the plucking technique as it results in better quality fur and more money terrified white rabbits , screaming with fear , are stretched prone on wooden boards and held by the neck while that much - prized soft fur is plucked by hand — though scalped might be a more appropriate term			1
hair is wrenched from the follicles until only raw , pink skin remains			2
in other scenes , the defenceless creatures are tethered with rope by the front and back legs while they are sheared by men armed with metal scissors , who pay little attention to the cuts they are inflicting on the animals			0
there can be little doubt that in this footage , rabbits are treated in a horrifying manner			2
‘ after their fur is yanked out , the gentle , sensitive rabbits are left in shock , able only to lie motionless inside their tiny , filthy cages , ’ says @entity71 spokesman @entity135			2
animal cruelty : the angora rabbits are alive throughout the plucking and are kept for several years , plucked every few months , before their throats are slit locked up : the cages injure the rabbit 's feet and the insanitary conditions see many of them , such as this one , suffer infections and illness rather than simply trimming the fur with clippers , as many breeders do , the factory workers are seen wrenching the fur from the root , causing the rabbits incredible pain			1
the reason for this cruelty ? simple economics — and expedience			0
@entity36 has a trade value of £ 22 to £ 28 per kilogram , but the longer hair that comes from plucking , as opposed to shearing , can sell for more than double that			1
as for speed , one only needs to watch the footage to discover how quick removing the hair in this manner is			2
@entity36 breeders in the @entity10 told the @entity171 that plucking a rabbit without causing harm takes up to two weeks of gently removing loosened hair , not the minutes it takes to rip hunks of fur from a terrified animal in the factories visited in @entity62			1
shearing a rabbit takes up to an hour when done with care — but again , the process recorded on these videos was terrifyingly swift			0
this process is repeated every three months for the two to three years of the animal ’s life			0
angoras can live for five years , or even as long as ten years when well looked after , but farmed rabbits have a much shorter lifespan , which can be as little as two years			2
yet it is not just the manner in which these animals — which are more commonly kept as pets in @entity10 — have their fur harvested that has sparked animal welfare concerns			0
pictures show forlorn looking rabbits with tattered and partially shaved fur cowering in tiny cages in half - covered sheds			2
pain and suffering : the terror in the animal 's eyes is unmistakeable as a worker with a @entity62 angora trader stretches it out and yanks out its fur ‘ the rabbits are kept in tiny filthy cages , surrounded by their own waste , ’ says mr @entity135			1
‘ the cages offer little protection from the elements			0
they are forced to spend their entire miserable lives standing on the thin cage wires that constantly cut into their sensitive footpads , never having a chance to dig , jump or run around			0
’ once the rabbit ’s health fails , they are of little use to breeders			0
those who survive the brutal conditions in these rabbit farms are killed by having their necks broken , and are hung upside down and have their throats slit before their flesh is sold to local markets , @entity71 says			0
there are thought to be more than 50 million rabbits on angora farms in @entity62 , producing more than 4,000 tonnes of fur a year			1
left to recover : after the rabbit had had all its fur yanked out it is thrown into a cage to regrow its fur in complete solitude it is by far the world ’s biggest producer , followed by @entity251 , @entity252 , the @entity253 and @entity254 , which produce the bulk of the remaining 10 per cent of the supply chain			0
while plucking of angora rabbits does occur in other countries , the @entity171 has not found any reports of the particularly barbaric form witnessed in these @entity62 factories being employed elsewhere			1
there is no doubt that @entity62 has a woeful record of factory farming and animal cruelty , particularly when it comes to producing clothes for the fashion industry , many of which end up on sale on @entity274			1
in 2009 , campaigners exposed how down used in jackets and other items was being ripped from the bodies of live geese by @entity62 suppliers			1
two years later it emerged that raccoon dogs were being skinned while still alive to produce imitation sheepskin boots			0
no hope : this young bunny is in the process of regrowing its fur while recovering from an eye infection in a naked steel cage in @entity62 , there are no penalties for the abuse of animals on farms and minimal , if any , standards to regulate their treatment			1
a new law was drafted in 2009 , but has not been implemented			0
the @entity10 once had its own angora industry , but it died out after @entity299 and now remains only as a cottage industry , with producers unable to compete with the cheap angora from eastern countries such as @entity62			1
‘ we ca n’t compete with the @entity62 , so it ’s very much a niche market , ’ says @entity304 , who breeds and produces angora on a small scale on her farm in @entity308 and has raised rabbits for the past 30 years			1
‘ i ’m one of the few left , there are no commercial producers in the @entity10 any more			0
as an animal , they are lovely and very easy to keep and the fibre is absolutely gorgeous			0
’ her rabbits ( all lovingly tended to , nails clipped , and coats combed ) mostly live on the barn floor and are clipped , not plucked , every 14 to 16 weeks			1
@entity36 rabbits regularly moult , which allows breeders to harvest their hair in this manner			1
‘ that ’s the most labour intensive part , ’ says the mother - of - four			0
she says that , far from screaming and struggling to escape , the rabbits become quite ‘ soporific ’ as they are groomed and clipped , a process that can take an hour for each one			2
if a rabbit is not clipped , she says , its fur can become matted , ‘ almost imprisoning ’ the animal			0
ms @entity304 , who runs @entity335 , sells her rabbits ’ fibres to independent wool spinners in small packs of nearly an ounce for £ 3			2
a single angora rabbit , well looked after , may produce about just over 1lb of fur a year from three to four clippings , which is blended with other fibres to make a 50 per cent angora yarn — enough to make two and a half jumpers			2
a single jumper would cost £ 64 to make with £ 8 balls of yarn , a far higher price than the mainstream fashion industry can tolerate with its insistence on large profit margins			0
on the @entity10 @entity9 , the @entity171 found angora products on sale in every store we visited , most of them displaying labels saying ‘ @entity359 ’			2
while this does n’t necessarily mean the wool was sourced in @entity62 , the vast majority of angora sold in @entity10 comes from that country			1
of the retailers approached by the @entity171 — which included @entity54 , @entity52 and @entity366 — only @entity367 told us where they sourced their angora : @entity62			1
among the store ’s offerings this season are a £ 39.50 roll - neck jumper , made from 38 per cent angora , and a three - quarter sleeve cardigan in the palest of pinks , made of 55 per cent angora , for £ 49.50			0
a spokesman said : ‘ we put animal welfare at the heart of our business and are committed to the highest standards in all our supply chains , including angora wool			0
’ the store said live plucking did not meet their high welfare standards , while @entity366 also condemned the practice and @entity52 said only shearing and combing were acceptable			0
‘ as a condition of doing business with us , all our suppliers must adhere to our strict animal welfare policies , ’ said the @entity367 spokesman			0
while this may be the case for some stores , this week ’s horrific images of rabbits will surely be enough to give many @entity10 shoppers pause for thought when they stop to stroke the fluffy angora jumpers on offer on our @entity9 this winter .			1
