by @entity0 ' @entity2 ' filmmaker @entity1 did n't think twice when internet trolls sent her a mean email about her weight , or mocked her movie , but she never expected to get death threats			1
she was told by fellow ' body - positive ' filmmakers and writers that once she launched a @entity10 for a doc on body image , she should expect her share of criticism			1
' @entity2 's ' film description calls it a ' feature - length documentary that exposes how popular culture fosters fat prejudice and then offers an alternative way of thinking			1
' internet trolls threatened filmmaker @entity1 with rape and murder when she announced a documentary , ' @entity26 , ' on body shaming so far the film has made $ 32,862 of its $ 38,050 goal on @entity10 , with 25 days to go			1
some of the backlash was harmless			2
there were people who told her her time would be better spent getting off the sofa and putting away the donuts			0
she does n't even touch donuts because of a gluten allergy , and exercises with a trainer three times a week			0
' i can laugh at those people because [ they ] believe the stereotype that fat is a simple concept , ' @entity43 , 35 , told @entity48			1
i ’m going to help educate you by making this film			0
' @entity43 's film has raised $ 32,862 of its $ 38,050 @entity10 goal and she plans to include a mini-documentary on her harassment on the dvd but it did n't take long for things to escalate from jokes about her eating habits to full - scale harassment			1
anonymous people began calling her home with rape and death threats			0

a troll even took her video promo for the film , and spliced it with new footage to load on @entity85 under the title : ' cakes : the @entity88			0

@entity43 tried to get the video removed by filing a complaint for copyright infringement			1
the troll struck back , sending her a tweet telling her to retract the complaint ' or else			0
' in a way , all the attacks did was help convince her the project was important			0
while her own experience with online harassment wo n't be part of her finished film , she will likely include a short of the battles as a dvd extra			2
' i really do feel like we do live in a culture that ’s brutally cruel to fat people of all ages — children and adults alike , ' she said			0
