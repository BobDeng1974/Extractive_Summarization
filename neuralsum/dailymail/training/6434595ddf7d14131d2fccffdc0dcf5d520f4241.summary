' i know that with 4 - 4 - 2 the stats are giving the positive results , but when you analyse the game i have twitched my ass on the bench because we were out of balance			1
' the expert analysis of @entity11 manager @entity10 captured the imagination this week when he admitted playing his 4 - 4 - 2 formation resulted in a very unhappy derri√®re			1
but does that deserve a place in the @entity17 for bizarre managers ' quotes ? let 's compare			2
@entity11 manager @entity10 complained about 4 - 4 - 2 leaving him ' twitching my ass ' @entity22 seeing as we all knew he 'd make an appearance , we may as well get the special one out of the way immediately			1
but how do you choose from one of his many press conference quips ? well , firing a parting shot at owner @entity33 for not investing in the squad before being forced out of the club in 2007 , @entity22 said : ' no eggs , no omelette			2
and it depends on the quality of the eggs			2
' in the supermarket , you have eggs class one , class two , class three			2
some are more expensive than others and some give you better omelettes			0
so when the class one eggs are in @entity51 and you can not go there , you have a problem			0
' @entity54 manager @entity22 is never far from a memorable quip during press conferences @entity57 perhaps best remembered for his infamous ' fact ! ' rant against then - @entity11 manager sir @entity60 , but @entity57 was another who had a thing for breakfast ingredients			1
the former @entity64 manager answered @entity66 's remarks on @entity68 's involvement in the club by saying : ' @entity71 liquid in a bottle has to be milk , ' - apparently , a @entity75 phrase which means things are so obvious for everyone to see ( except perhaps the meaning of the saying itself )			1
@entity57 then followed this up when accused of having a poor transfer record and inheriting a poor squad by exclaiming : ' some people can not see a priest on a mountain of sugar , ' - which again means something akin to stating the obvious ... without actually doing so			1
@entity57 ( right ) made some memorable speeches during his time as @entity64 manager sir @entity60 and so to @entity60			1
he was n't against using food to make a point , either			0
before a @entity97 game against a notoriously tricky @entity99 side , the @entity95 @entity11 manager indulged in an opening course of mind games : ' when an @entity102 tells me it 's pasta on the plate , i check under the sauce to make sure			1
they are the inventors of the smokescreen			0
' former @entity11 manager sir @entity60 was not immune to making an infamous quote @entity110 @entity110 was @entity64 's greatest ever manager , and will also be remembered by @entity112 fans for his cutting put downs of hated rivals @entity114 , which included this collection of pearls : former @entity64 manager @entity110 liked to add to the rivalry between the @entity118 and neighbours @entity114 @entity120 @entity120 was never short of sharing a few words			1
the former @entity123 manager was n't even scared to engage @entity60 in a war of words			1
@entity120 , before the then - @entity11 manager had claimed a second @entity97 , said : ' for all his horses , knighthoods and championships , he has n't got two of what i 've got			1
and i do n't mean balls ! ' and the testicular references did n't end there as , when discussing the influx of foreign players into the @entity139 game , he said : ' i ca n't even spell spaghetti never mind talk @entity102			1
how could i tell an @entity102 to get the ball ? he might grab mine			0
' @entity120 was never short of sharing a few words as the @entity145 manager proved @entity146 never short of a decent quote			1
@entity146 , in between being ' more chuffed than a badger at the start of mating season ' , had this to say about an ' ugly ' result against @entity152			1
please note , it should be read with that typical deadpan @entity155 accent for full effect			0
' to put it in gentleman 's terms if you 've been out for a night and you 're looking for a young lady and you pull one , some weeks they 're good looking and some weeks they 're not the best , ' he said			1
' our performance today would have been not the best looking bird but at least we got her in the taxi			0
she were n't the best looking lady we ended up taking home but she was very pleasant and very nice , so thanks very much , let 's have a coffee			1
' @entity146 has become renowned for memorable quotes during his managerial career in @entity139 sir @entity177 the late , great sir @entity177 was rarely short of a quirky comment			1
so , try these on for size : @entity182 legend sir @entity177 had a few quotes up his sleeve at @entity185 @entity186 @entity186 was another manager who must have missed the media training classes , much to the delight and amusement of anyone listening ... here are just a few examples that left reporters wishing they had chosen a different profession			2
reporter : ' bang , there goes your unbeaten run			0
can you take it ? ' @entity186 : ' no , i 'm just going to crumble like a wreck			0
i 'll go home , become an alcoholic and maybe jump off a bridge			2
@entity203 , i think i can take it , yeah			0
' reporter : ' so , @entity186 , in what areas do you think @entity208 were better than you today ? ' @entity186 : ' what areas ? mainly that big green one out there ... ' and , probably the finest one word answer in the history of football interviews			0
reporter : ' @entity186 , can we have a quick word please ? ' @entity186 : ' @entity217			0
' [ walks off ] @entity186 is among the best for leaving journalists stunned during interviews after and before matches @entity222 @entity222 usually gives well rehearsed and educated answers to questions from the press , even if it sometimes appears as he is struggling to keep a straight face			0
but the @entity228 has occasionally drawn into using strange metaphors , especially when baited by enduring rivals			0
in response to @entity60 's jibe that @entity233 were n't deserving double winners in 2002 and @entity11 were the better team , @entity222 simply answered : ' everyone thinks they have the prettiest wife at home			1
' and , he also reverted to the female form when describing his inability to convince a homesick @entity242 to stay at @entity243			0
' it 's like you wanting to marry @entity246 and she does n't want you , what can i do about it ? i can try to help you , but if she does not want to marry you what can i do ? , ' he said			0
the answer being to let @entity242 leave and sneak @entity254 from @entity256 's youth academy			0
@entity233 boss @entity222 usually gives well - rehearsed interviews but has been known for his own quips ... @entity259 quit football to preach about @entity261 and star in soft porn films click here for the full story and finally ... it not just football managers that are renowned for memorable quips during press conferences			1
sometimes , it comes down to the players			0
step forward , @entity259 himself			0
greeting the journalists before him in the wake of a lengthy ban for his kung - fu kick on a @entity279 supporter in 1995 , @entity259 read out the following statement before abruptly leaving			2
' when the seagulls follow the trawler , it 's because they think sardines will be thrown into the sea			0
' quite what you make of the @entity259 's musings should be determined by you but as @entity186 - yes , him again - later said : ' if a @entity228 goes on about seagulls , trawlers and sardines , he 's called a philosopher			2
i 'd just be called a short @entity296 bum talking crap '			2
@entity259 launches a a kung - fu kick at @entity279 supporter @entity299 in 1995 stewards attempt to restrain the forward after his assault on the @entity279 supporter @entity259 reacted angrily to abuse from a @entity279 fan after he was sent off during the match at @entity307			2

@entity10 : @entity11 playing 4 - 4 - 2 leaves me ' twitching my ass ' because the team are ' out of balance '
the @entity315 manager gave the memorable quip on *thursday*
@entity11 drew 0 - 0 in the @entity319 *fourth* round against @entity320
@entity322 look at how it comes to nine others in our *top* 10 list
' if @entity114 were playing down the bottom of my garden , i 'd draw the *curtains* . '
' when i 've got nothing better to do , i look down the league table to see how @entity114 are getting along . '
' this city has two great teams - @entity64 and @entity64 *reserves* . '
' @entity340 has done very well for us , considering his age . we have *introduced* some movement into his game because he has got two good legs now . last season he played with one leg . '
' home **advantage** gives you an **advantage** . '
' look at those olive trees ! they 're 200 years old - from before the time of @entity355 . '
