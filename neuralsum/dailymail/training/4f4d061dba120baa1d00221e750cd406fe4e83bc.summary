by @entity0 - parkinson last updated at 4:25 pm on 21st september 2011 caravans from the @entity4 travellers ' site have upped sticks and set up an illegal camp 55 miles away leading residents to fear that many more are on their way			1
around 20 families have moved from @entity11 to @entity12 , close to @entity13 in @entity14 , after gaining access to a 100 - hectare piece of land			1
those who stayed at @entity4 , where travellers have been in a ten - year battle with @entity20 , were given a last - minute reprieve from the @entity22 after a judge ruled that the proposed measures ‘ may go further ’ than the terms of the enforcement notices			1
one of the travellers at the site said there were another 40 caravans on their way as people in @entity13 feared there would be a similar situation to that in @entity11			1
scores of caravans from @entity4 are expected to move to @entity12 in @entity13 ( pictured ) the 100 - hectare site neighbours a golf course , horse riding centre and various other outdoor pursuits venues although travellers own the @entity11 site near @entity44 they only have planning consent for half the site			1
however , the whole area is strewn with mobile homes and they have been in a battle with the local council for the last ten years			1
the @entity13 site is described as an ' athletics track ' and ' riding centre '			1
nearby there are golf and rugby clubs , and a children 's playground			2
travellers first started pitching up on monday night and it has been alleged that one man arrived in a mobile home , using bolt - cutters to break through the park gates , according to the @entity65 one of the travellers , @entity67 , 29 , claimed he had lived at @entity4 for seven years			1
he said : ' i moved to @entity13 rather than wait for the bailiffs because my health was suffering			2
my son and daughter were already in schools in @entity11			2
then we had to move and lose it all			2
' we came to @entity13 because we 've been here before			2
the word has now spread back to @entity4			2
there 'll be 20 to 40 more caravans coming from @entity4			1
we have nowhere else to go			2
' people living near the site have criticised the police and local council for not responding more quickly			1
one neighbour said : ' i used to look out of my bedroom window and see a beautiful park			0
i 'm sure the gypsies wo n't cause trouble			0
let 's hope it stays that way			0
' a spokesman for @entity95 said : ' the council was made aware of the encampment and immediately started the standard legal procedure for eviction			1
we expect to move them on very soon			0
' around 60 caravans from @entity4 ( pictured ) are expected to pitch up at the site in @entity13 the travellers started moving from @entity4 to @entity12 on monday night last stand : @entity106 ( centre ) appealed to prime minister @entity108 to stop the eviction in scenes bordering on farce , the eviction of @entity4 began with an all - day stand - off and ended with yet another legal hitch in a local council ’s efforts to clear @entity118 ’s largest illegal site earlier this week			1
on one side were protesters and travellers insisting they shall not be moved			1
on the other , bailiffs and a small platoon of blue - uniformed officials spouting health and safety concerns through a loudhailer that did n’t work			1
@entity128 : for @entity20 to have had to battle on behalf of their residents for ten years to get the illegal caravan site on @entity4 evicted is absurd			1
the cost to the council of the whole operation could be up to £ 8million			0
planning enforcement should be nothing like as long or as costly			0
sorting out this mess will not be easier			0
but rather than attack the government for making the situation worse it should be recognised that they are restoring some semblance of sanity			0
@entity143 will help and the government should press ahead with it			0
read more here but this long - awaited first stage in the @entity147 was abruptly halted when a judge sitting 50 miles away granted a last - gasp injunction to delay further action			1
now the operation to clear the site has been put on hold until at least the end of the week after mr @entity155 ruled at the @entity22 in @entity156 that the proposed measures ‘ may go further ’ than the terms of the enforcement notices			1
@entity20 was thrown into disarray last night as its lawyers scrambled to read through the injunction			0
leader @entity162 hurriedly left a television interview for an urgent briefing			0
he did n’t explain the ruling when he returned to give a brief statement an hour later but said he was ' extremely disappointed and frustrated ' by the decision			0
he added : ‘ the motion was put forward to the @entity22 without notice , which meant the judge only had one side of the story and therefore has given the council until friday to go back to the @entity22 to make its argument			2
‘ i am absolutely clear that , in this issue on friday , the court will find in the council ’s favour and the clearance will be able to continue			0
’ the latest twist came as it was revealed that the travellers on the site at @entity184 in @entity11 have been offered a total of 38 local authority homes to move from the site			1
danger : a sign of the barricade at @entity4 warning that the 18 - year - old girl attached by her neck will be killed if bailiffs open the gate @entity20 has suggested a variety of temporary flats and houses over the past six months in an effort to resolve the decade - long stand - off			1
but they were turned down for reasons including because they smelled of smoke or were made of bricks and mortar , ' contravening ' the travellers ' desire to spend their life on the road			1
a council spokesman said the injunction provided a ' blanket ban against the removal of any and all property ' from the illegal camp			0
a source later said they believed it might refer to the @entity22 order earlier this year which stated the eviction could go ahead and the concrete driveways , ‘ hard standings ’ , the caravans stand on could be removed			0
the source added they understood this failed to refer to fences and some other structures on the hard - standings , creating a legal loophole			2
news of the injunction brought whoops of delight from travellers and supporters			2
one , who gave her name as @entity238 , said : ' thank @entity239 for @entity241 justice			0
' the travellers and troublemakers had manned the ramparts of their barricade from before dawn as police , the local council and bailiffs set up camp beside the main entrance			1
fifty - one plots containing homes built without planning permission are set to be cleared from the six - acre site , along with their remaining residents , in an operation which could cost £ 18million			1
like opposing armies , the two sides emerged into daylight in different uniforms – the authorities a mixture of orange , yellow and blue , versus the travellers ’ preference for track - suits			1
for hours they could be seen making their separate preparations for war			0
and every sign was that this is going to be a long campaign			0
dangerous protest : an 18 - year - old known only as @entity277 , right , is attached to a scaffolding pole with a bike lock around her neck			2
she and fellow protester @entity281 , left , are also handcuffed together inside the barrel reinforcements : bailiffs move onto the site as the tense stand - off grew if anyone needed confirmation , it came with the arrival of a stout traveller humping a consignment of supplies towards the gate			1
about 200 rolls of toilet paper in jumbo packs were pushed through a gap in the barricade to eager waiting hands			0
the delivery was followed by supplies of high carbohydrate and energy foods such as crisps , peanuts and @entity307			0
nearby , a traveller in a distinctive white homburg was holding court with reporters			0
' do n’t give them your name , @entity316 , ' a woman shouted from behind			0
one traveller who gave his name as @entity320 added : ' we have got to take a stand			0
if we do n’t , this will just carry on with other traveller communities			0
' other families complained they had nowhere else to go – an argument weakened by the discovery that some have luxury homes back in @entity330			2
their resistance , which has received support from the @entity333 , @entity334 and the @entity335 , is in defiance of officials who insist they are breaking the law			0
a woman dressed as a witch took up position with a walkie - talkie to a lookout platform on the ramparts			2
' they ’re coming ! ' someone shouted , and all eyes turned towards a cluster of hard - hatted bailiffs being escorted by police towards the blocked gate			1
protesters filled flour bombs and distributed missiles as they advanced , pageant - like , up the main approach			2
from here , the platoon leader expressed health and safety concerns about the barricade , straining now under the weight of opposing forces			0
a sign on the outside said a woman had secured herself to the gate by a noose – and warned that if it was forced open , she would be killed			1
shouts of ‘ racists ’ drowned out most of the bailiff ’s remaining words , and cheers accompanied his retreat			0
had his megaphone been working , the travellers might have heard him saying something about trying to resolve the stand - off swiftly and peacefully			1
neither outcome looked likely .			0

around 20 families are already at the site as another 40 make their way there
local residents fear there will be a repeat of the scenes in @entity44
travellers ' made their way onto the field by using bolt - cutters to open gate '
