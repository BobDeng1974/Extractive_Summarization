plenty of us enjoyed pinging rubber bands at unsuspecting school friends as children , but now one man has taken inspiration from his youth to create what he believes to be the ultimate office weapon			1
the @entity10 is able to fire 672 rubber bands up to 26 feet ( eight metres ) at a rate of 14 shots a second from its 16 barrels			1
while such a weapon could no doubt inflict pain on a human target , the design student behind the toy is trying to raise money so that he can sell his wooden contraption to the public later this year			2
design student @entity32 , 18 , based his contraption on the @entity34 - one of the world 's first rapid - fire weapons			1
originally invented by @entity37 , the forerunner to the modern machine gun is known for its use by the @entity42 forces during the @entity43 in the 1860s , which was the first time it was employed in combat			0
mr @entity32 spent a year developing the toy - which he believes is the world ’s most advanced rubber band gun - using skills he honed building model airplanes			1
the @entity53 student is raising funds on @entity55 and has attracted $ 70,000 of pledges more than the $ 5,000 he set out to gather , demonstrating the demand for such a @entity60 weapon			0
the gun is expected to go on sale this year for $ 140 ( around £ 80 )			1
the rubber band machine gun , invented by design student @entity32 , is powered by five aa batteries and can be reloaded with more ammunition in minutes string is wound onto the drum of the gun , passing through cuts in the barrels then up to 672 rubber bands are stretched over the string and the 16 barrels			1
an electric motor powered by five aa batteries reels off the string			0
this pulls off the rubber bands one by one , releasing them into flight with a range of up to 26 feet or eight metres			1
' everyone loved having rubber band fights as kids and now children of all ages can enjoy practising their shooting skills with a @entity10 , ’ mr @entity32 said			0
he explained that the automatic machine gun is made from birch plywood and cut out using a @entity88 ( computer numerical control ) machine , which allows a user to enter a design using a computer that is then cut out using a router			2
the gun comes in three colours : original birch , burnt wood and black			0
mr @entity32 said : ‘ with my @entity100 everyone can feel like @entity101 , launching a rubber storm , and throwing a pound of rubber bands into their opponent			0

‘ i have spent the last year developing the gun and the last stage of it was to invent the " fast charger " which means you can reload the rubber bands very quickly			2
' he claims there is nothing else like it on the market .			0

the rubber band machine gun is able to fire 672 rubber bands up to 26 feet ( eight metres ) at a rate of 14 shots a second from its 16 barrels
it was created by an 18 - year - old @entity170 design student who was inspired by the working of the @entity34 - an early rapid - fire weapon
the gun is set to go on sale early this year for around $ 140 ( £ *85* ) and comes in three colours
