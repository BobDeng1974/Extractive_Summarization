by @entity0 published : 14:35 est , 9 april 2013 updated : 14:41 est , 9 april 2013 a shoot featuring @entity2 playing nurse to a baby tiger , lion and gibbon has sparked anger from animal rights activists			1
the @entity10 spread , titled @entity11 , was styled by @entity12 and will appear in all 26 international editions of the magazine			1
but @entity15 argues that the endangered animals are being treated like props			1
in a statement published on @entity20 , the organization singled out the young gibbon as being particularly vulnerable			1
fashion gone wild ? @entity2 poses with a three - month - old tiger in the new issue of @entity10			1
but animal rights activists have voiced concern over the feline 's welfare it read : ' the gibbon featured in the photographs is an infant and should be with his mother at all times			2
besides the emotional trauma that he has undoubtedly suffered as a result of the separation , his delicate immune system is still developing , and he is susceptible to illnesses that humans carry			2
' all the animals in the photographs are endangered and should be protected , rather than being treated like props			2
' @entity47 communications manager for the @entity48 also expressed reservations			2
' though @entity12 may have had the best intentions , the animals used in this ad are endangered , exotic animals – they 're not domesticated and should n’t be viewed as cuddly pets , ' she told @entity55			1
monkey business : a seven - month - old gibbon also featured in the high fashion shoot , and was provided by the @entity60 - based @entity59 nurse @entity61 : the supermodel plays carer to the young endangered animals while posing in @entity65 ' even if these animals were sourced legally , the global exotic pet trade involves capturing , killing , and harming animals to remove them from the wild for breeding or – in the case of these ads – entertainment			2
it is in the nature of these animals to be wild , and this ad could misrepresent to consumers how dangerous ( and endangered ) they truly are			0
' ' these animals are hand - raised by humans because the mother has rejected them			0
without us , they would not have survived ' the three - month - old tiger and the seven - month - old gibbon featured in the shoot were provided by the @entity60 - based @entity59 , which was furious about the @entity15 accusations			0
@entity59 vice president @entity87 told @entity55 that its animals are captive - born for at least five generations			0
' these [ animals ] are hand - raised by humans because the mother has rejected them , ' she explained , adding that without the organization 's help , they would not have survived			0
small wonder : a baby leopard also featured in the @entity12 - styled shoot , though it was not supplied by the @entity59 ' they have the care of two full time veterinarians , and get the same respect , love and passion as a human being , ' she added			1
of the animals ' treatment on photo shoots , she added : ' these animals are always accompanied by professional , licensed handlers			0
' the @entity59 hopes that its words will reassure commenters who have voiced concern about the animals ' welfare			0
defense : the @entity59 says its animals are captive - born for at least five generations , and are hand - raised by humans because the mother has rejected them initial reactions to the shoot were extreme			0
one wrote on @entity20 : ' i will no longer be buying @entity10 after this			1
' another added : ' this is disgusting use of an endangered infant primate to sell clothes			0
this poor gibbon was no doubt ripped from its mother in the wild , just to become the play item of a dumb fashion model			0
really … what is the matter with people ? ? ' and a third acerbically read : ' endangered primates as accessories ? ! makes the model unattractive , the stylist talentless , and the magazine more valuable as toilet paper			1
