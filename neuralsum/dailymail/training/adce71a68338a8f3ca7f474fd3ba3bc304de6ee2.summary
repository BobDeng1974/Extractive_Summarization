@entity0 totters past the yachts on her high - heeled @entity3 ’s to air - kiss @entity5			1
the heiress to a £ 5billion fortune meets the supermodel			2
in the minutes before sunday 's @entity12 this thin thread of tarmac next to the @entity11 will be the world ’s most exclusive catwalk			2
a horde of photographers will scramble to capture this gaudy parade of sashaying stars			2
@entity0 and her husband , @entity19 , pop brat @entity19 , @entity21 star @entity19 and @entity23 singer @entity22 will be clicked furiously			1
one who will not be in attendance , however , is @entity48			2
he asked for a pass , but @entity0 ’s daddy — @entity29 , the sport ’s diminutive puppeteer — politely declined			1
@entity19 , a strangely skinny little chap , was camera - shy			1
he went in to see @entity0 in his paddock headquarters			1
what , one wonders , did the 20 - year - old @entity55 pop star and the 83 - year - old son of a @entity58 trawlerman talk about ? whatever , @entity19 took a ‘ selfie ’ with @entity0 before scampering out of the back door and scuttling away in his white beanie and orange shorts without the cadre of photographers spotting him			1
@entity66 : @entity67 , on standby for @entity70 's @entity69 squad , speaks to @entity71 thigh 's the limit : @entity22 performed on friday night at the star - studded @entity12 @entity73 : @entity23 star @entity22 performs at the @entity74 in @entity39 @entity76 couple : @entity19 and @entity0 with @entity79 model @entity77 belles of the ball : @entity82 and @entity29 's daughter @entity0 at the charity ball party all night : @entity23 model @entity5 , here with @entity84 , celebrates her 44th birthday in @entity39 the venue for @entity5 ’s 44th birthday party on friday was apt — the @entity89 , a brassy , swanky joint owned by her former boyfriend , the @entity94 high - roller @entity84			1
he is the one with his shirt undone to his solar plexus and the swagger of a man who has just broken the bank at @entity101			2
his boat , @entity103 , a floating monument to extravagance , cost him nearly £ 70million			2
that , though , is not the most expensive in the harbour			2
@entity107 , the @entity108 drinks mogul and owner of the @entity111 team , has a yacht — the indian empress — half as big again			0
he bought it from the @entity116 @entity115 for a few million more than @entity84 spent			0
@entity118 ’s @entity117 , worth £ 300m , is not here this year ( though many @entity119 are moving into the area permanently )			0
above the harbour nestles a range of five - star hotels			0
the most exclusive is the @entity125 on @entity126			0
the @entity128 there cost £ 90,000 last night			0
so extensive , and expensive , is the hotel wine cellar that during @entity131 , a brick wall was built around it to stop looting			0
the other grand hotel is the @entity134			1
caviar , oyster sauce , foie gras and a glass of champagne there will set you back £ 100			0
it is where @entity0 usually stays			1
he has been invited on a boat by @entity146 , the chairman of @entity147 , the private equity firm that owns @entity148			1
@entity149 turn : @entity55 singer @entity19 takes his seat in the front row at the @entity74 event different ball game : @entity155 midfielder @entity67 poses for a photo with @entity157 fan : @entity67 visits the @entity160 garage ahead of the @entity12 the weekend is dotted with glamorous social engagements			1
at friday ’s annual fashion show , @entity0 sat next to @entity163			1
the prince last night hosted perhaps the most exclusive of all events — the cocktail party in the @entity167 overlooking the harbour			0
two hundred or so of the great and the good are invited			0
the @entity164 will host the traditional gala dinner tonight			0
this is still black tie			0
the race winner sits next to the @entity164 and princess @entity173			0
if you look closely at @entity101 you can see some frayed edges : ugly buildings and facelifts that have fallen flat			0
as @entity179 observed , it can be ‘ a sunny place for shady people ’			0
but , still , this is the only venue on the calendar which pays @entity0 no money for the privilege of staging a grand prix			1
‘ @entity39 does more for us than we do for it , ’ conceded @entity0			1

@entity19 took a selfie with @entity148 *supremo* @entity29
@entity0 , @entity19 and @entity22 also in @entity39
@entity39 is the only venue on the calendar which pays @entity0 no money for the privilege of staging a grand prix
