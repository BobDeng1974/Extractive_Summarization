by @entity0 she is set to play @entity1 in the second round of the @entity3 today but it seems that @entity5 has done more than step up her training regime to be at the top of her game			1
in her teens @entity5 , 22 , the current @entity10 no. 1 who is ranked number 4 in the world , underwent a breast reduction to improve her tennis			1
aged 18 she announced she was having her breasts reduced from a @entity17 to a @entity18 because they were slowing her reaction time			1
tennis pro @entity5 , 22 , who is playing @entity1 in the second round of the @entity3 today , underwent a breast reduction to improve her game four years ago perhaps it has helped			1
@entity5 landed a spot in the world 's top 50 at the end of 2012 , won her first 6 @entity26 titles , and was named both the @entity26 's @entity27 and @entity29 's @entity28			1
' it has been an important part of her career , ' @entity30 , a @entity31 who used to coach @entity32 , told @entity35			1
' i guess it was the right decision			2
i did not see her then			2
i have seen some photos , but she took that decision and it was a good one			2
' also in the @entity31 newspapers it is the same thing			2
that ’s why she was famous			2
let ’s hope she will win a @entity47 and then they will start talking about the @entity47 and not something else			2
' but not everyone was in support of @entity5 's surgery choice			2
@entity53 beach volleyball player @entity52 launched a big - boob - pride campaign in 2010 after hearing the news			2
she argued : ' if she does this , it sends out the message that girls with big boobs ca n't play sports , and that is just wrong			2
' i am @entity64 , and i have never found them to be a problem			2
i could be double what i have and i would still be okay to perform			0
' dr @entity68 , cosmetic doctor at @entity69 of @entity70 , the first doctor in the @entity72 ever to offer a non-surgical technique for breast reductions said : ' for professional athletes who maintain intense training regimes , these problems will of course be felt far more heavily			0
' training for long hours each day will only intensify the discomfort , meaning the size of their breasts wo n’t just get in the way of them exercising , but it can also affect their downtime away from sport , because it may take longer for them to rest and recover if they are still in pain in the back and breast areas			1
' over the years the inability to exercise or take part in sport has certainly become a more commonly cited reason for patients i see who are seriously considering undergoing a reduction			0
' before and after : at the age of 18 , @entity5 had her breasts reduced from a @entity17 , left , to a @entity18 , right , because they were slowing her reaction time dr @entity68 says that medical advancements may also have contributed to the growing number of female athletes undergoing breast reductions			1
' now there are non surgical breast reduction methods that exist , which can allow women to undergo a reduction with very limited downtime			0
' for females who train regularly or are actively involved in sport , but are being prevented from doing so because of the size of their breast , a minimally invasive reduction technique could be a feasible solution , reducing the amount of time they would need to take away from sport to recover			1
he does , however , warn of the dangers of breast reduction in young athletes , many who are under the age of 25			1
' it ’s important to note though that a breast reduction wo n’t be suitable for everyone			0
it is actually a procedure which is most suited to post-menopausal women , so a very young athlete , for example , might not be suitable for treatment , ' he adds			0
while there 's no suggestion that @entity142 gymnast @entity141 has any qualms , many gymnasts are pushed to be as breastless for as long as possible to help their career last year , it was widely reported that female athletes believed that the development of breasts could seriously hinder their careers - and could even prevent them from reaching @entity152 standard			1
according to @entity29 magazine , gymnasts push themselves to the ' brink of starvation ' to avoid developing breasts and a host of professional athletes have spent a lot of money to surgically reduce them			1
' for the modern athlete , the question is n't whether breasts get in the way -- it 's a question of how to compete around them ' , the magazine reported			1
@entity29 writer @entity168 cites female @entity171 competitor @entity170 's fight in february as a perfect example of a female athlete being hindered by her breasts			1
legends surrounding women 's breasts affecting their sporting prowess have circulated for years			1
one such legend suggests that female @entity180 cut off the right breast to hurl spears and shoot arrows more efficiently			0
once @entity170 flipped her opponent to the floor she quickly rushed to adjust her sports bra straps - a move that ended in disaster			0
' i got kicked straight in the chest right as i was trying to adjust my bra , ' @entity170 told @entity193			0
' you do n't see big titties in the @entity196 , and i think that 's for a reason , ' she added			0
@entity200 , author of the 1995 expose of gymnastics and figure skating , @entity199 , wrote that elite gymnasts would undereat and overtrain to delay menstruation			0
' you ca n't afford to have a woman 's body and compete at the highest level , ' she said			0
@entity209 , who at 14 was the youngest competitor on the 1996 gold medal @entity152 team added : ' the sport pushes us to be breastless little girls as long as possible			0
but though breasts were forbidden , privately we longed for them			1
' @entity170 ( left ) has spoken out to say : ' you do n't see big titties in the @entity196 , and i think that 's for a reason ' it has been found that when in motion the nipples of a c or d - cup breast can accelerate up to 45 mph in one second , which is faster than a @entity227 in 1995 , a controversial @entity229 golf analyst called @entity230 told a newspaper that ' women are handicapped by having boobs			0
it 's not easy for them to keep their left arm straight			0
their boobs get in the way			0
' and @entity230 may have a point			0
judging by research , women do seem to be held back - especially by larger breasts			1
a third of women taking part in the @entity247 with cup sizes ranging between @entity249 reported breast pain from exercise ; eight per cent even said the pain was ' distressing , horrible or excruciating '			0
a typical @entity254 breast weighs 0.43 of a pound and every additional cup size adds another 0.44 of a pound , according to research			0
@entity29 also reported that when in motion the nipples of a woman who has c or d - cup breasts can accelerate up to 45 mph in one second , which is faster than a @entity227			1
@entity265 , @entity266 at @entity267 said : ' large , heavy breasts can have significant physical and psychological effects on a lady 's wellbeing			1
' pain , discomfort , and interference with physical activities can affect all women 's daily lives and especially elite sportswomen			0
' i view this very much as a quality of life procedure that leads to immense patient satisfaction			0
for professional sportswomen the benefits associated with such an operation could make all the difference in her competitive edge			0
' less weight , less pain and more mobility would undoubtedly help those with very large symptomatic breasts			1
' protest : @entity53 beach volleyball player @entity52 launched a big - boob - pride campaign after @entity5 ( pictured ) announced she was having her breasts reduced from a @entity17 to a @entity18 because they were slowing her reaction time			1
