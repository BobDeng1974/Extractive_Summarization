by @entity0 @entity1 has reiterated her anger at the government 's policy towards @entity5 , saying she quit so she could ' live with myself ' - and not because she wants to write a warts - and - all memoir			1
the @entity9 peer , who was the first @entity11 woman to sit on @entity12 , dramatically quit as @entity14 minister on tuesday , claiming @entity16 's position on the @entity18 crisis was ' morally indefensible '			1
mr @entity16 was forced to break off from his holiday in @entity20 to respond to criticism from the peer that he has failed to condemn @entity5 's bomb attacks			1
others suggested one of the reasons she resigned was because she is about to publish her memoirs from her time in @entity12			1
@entity1 was well - known as a fastidious note - taker during meetings and her account of life in the @entity44 could prove explosive in the run - up to the general election			1
nicknamed ' the stenographer ' , publishers hope she will be persuaded to publish them within months			2
she has reportedly already received approaches from firms wanting to obtain the rights to her story			0
but , speaking on @entity55 's today show this morning , @entity1 said : ' am i about to publish a kiss and tell diary – no i am not			1
look , again this detracts from the main issue right now			0
' when asked whether she quit after not being promoted above chairman of the @entity9 , she added : ' if people want to make this about politics , that ’s a matter for them			1
' the reason why i resigned is the policy			0
i will not let this became a discussion about politics and tittle tattle and who said what , when			1
' my departure clearly says long after politics has come and gone i want to be able to live with myself			2
and by resigning and stepping down i can live with myself			1
' during the interview , @entity1 hinted that she had been unhappy with the government 's stance for some time			1
the @entity9 peer - the first @entity11 woman to serve in the @entity12 - today repeated her call for a suspension of arms exports to @entity5 , saying there is ' no clear commitment ' from the @entity79 on ' leading the international effort on accountability ' in her resignation letter , @entity1 said the government 's ' approach and language during the current crisis in @entity18 is morally indefensible , is not in @entity95 's national interest and will have a long term detrimental impact on our reputation internationally and domestically ' the peer said she hoped her resignation would bring together a ' broad coalition ' to address issues behind the conflict - so @entity95 would ' lead the international effort on accountability on both sides '			1
she said : ' for me at that moment the concern that i had was that even if the ceasefire had held , and i sincerely hoped it had , there was still no clear language from the government in relation to the condemnation of what had happened			0
' there was no clear commitment that we would lead the international effort on accountability on both sides for what had happened			0
' she went on : ' our language was not there			0
i do n't think it was just words that would have stopped me from doing what i did			0
' i think it was a combination of issues			0
it was the language that we were using , i think it was our lack of support for international justice and accountability for the crimes that had been committed			0
' @entity16 was forced to take a break from his holiday in @entity20 , pictured , to respond to her resignation			1
in a response , he said : ' i very much regret that we were not able to speak about your decision beforehand ' she also did not deny claims that she would not stayed in post if @entity149 was still foreign secretary , rather than @entity150			0
in her resignation letter , she praised @entity149 , saying he was ' probably one of the finest foreign secretaries this country has seen '			2
she responded : ' look , i think these discussions i ’m sure will carry on taking place at a later time			2
' without speaking to the prime minister first , @entity1 posted the resignation statement on her @entity160 feed			1
she said : ' with deep regret i have this morning written to the prime minister & tendered my resignation			2
i can no longer support @entity165 policy on @entity18			1
' @entity1 said today : ' i think it was our lack of support for international justice and accountability for the crimes that had been committed			1
' pictured : a @entity172 salvages family belongings from the rubble following an air - strike it came as displaced @entity177 began returning to their homes from @entity180 shelters after the latest ceasefire between @entity5 and @entity182 took effect			0
the 72 - hour truce was agreed by both sides in the month - long conflict which has seen hundreds killed			2
as part of her resignation , @entity1 called for an immediate suspension of arms exports to @entity5 , which has been backed by @entity192 and @entity193			1
today , she said the government needed to ' move towards a @entity196 policy that is in the long term sustainable '			0
she cited the @entity95 's decision to abstain when the @entity199 voted in november 2012 to recognise a @entity172 state as symptomatic of the problems			1
she added : ' there is no point in us talking about a two - state solution if we do n't do the simple things like recognising @entity207 in the way that the majority of the world has at the @entity180			0
' @entity1 dismissed complaints that she had failed to condemn thousands of rocket attacks on @entity5 by @entity182 , or the actions of @entity215 extremists in @entity216			1
she said : ' this dispute in @entity5 and this crisis is not a crisis between two religions			2
it has therefore got nothing to do with whether or not someone is a @entity224 or a @entity11 or indeed @entity225			1
' i have a very long and proud history of speaking out on the issue of anti-semitism , on speaking out against the persecution of @entity224 worldwide			0
i led the government effort on freedom of religion and belief			0
' in relation to @entity182 , as i said in my very first interview , @entity182 is a terrorist organisation and i have no doubt they have not acted in the best interest of the @entity172 people			0
' but i also made it clear that @entity5 as an occupying power has a responsibility not just to the @entity5 but also to the people that it occupies			0
' i have always believed in the right of @entity5 to exist - not just exist , but exist in a secure way			0
' i do not believe that this is a way they needed to conduct themselves in order to achieve their aims			0
' last night @entity192 upped pressure on the government to suspend arms exports to @entity5 as rocket fire and air strikes resumed			0
shadow foreign secretary @entity257 called for the publication of a @entity260 review of existing licences			0
he also insisted that @entity193 ministers should act to block exports , rather than merely posturing in public on the issue			0
born in @entity266 , @entity1 became the first muslim to sit in @entity12 when she was made @entity9 co-chairman following the 2010 election			1
she was later moved to the post of ‘ senior minister of state ’ at the @entity14 and minister for faith and communities in mr @entity16 ’s 2012 reshuffle – a move widely regarded as a demotion			2
the peer was still allowed to attend @entity12 meetings			1
despite the snub , however , she apparently harboured hopes of a promotion back to full @entity12 in last month ’s reshuffle			2
but in fact , she has been out of favour for some time with the @entity9 establishment			1
nevertheless , there are concerns among some @entity289 that – with the election just nine months away – the government ’s @entity18 stance could cost them the support of @entity11 voters in key constituencies			1
in her resignation letter , @entity1 wrote : ‘ my view has been that our policy in relation to the @entity196 peace process generally , but more recently our approach and language during the current crisis in @entity18 is morally indefensible , is not in @entity95 ’s national interest and will have a long - term detrimental impact on our reputation			1
’ she added : ‘ early evidence from the @entity309 and others shows the fall - out of the current conflict … and our response to it becoming a basis for radicalisation could have consequences for us for years to come			2
’ in the letter , she also referred to ' great unease across the @entity14 amongst both ministers and senior officials ' about the government ’s policy on @entity18 - but said today she would not ' name names '			2
in his reply , mr @entity16 expressed ‘ regret ’ that they had been unable to speak before she decided to go			2
‘ of course , we believe that @entity5 has the right to defend itself , ’ he wrote			0
‘ but we have consistently made clear our grave concerns about the heavy toll of civilian casualties and have called on @entity5 to exercise restraint , and to find ways to bring this fighting to an end			0

@entity9 peer , first @entity11 woman in @entity12 , posted resignation on @entity160
she said @entity16 's position on @entity18 crisis was ' morally indefensible '
critics say she quit after not being promoted or to write book of memoirs
she denied *allegations* , saying her exit would not become about ' tittle tattle '
@entity1 said resigning was because she ' wanted to live with myself '
@entity358 believes @entity95 's stance on conflict has been *flawed* for some time
