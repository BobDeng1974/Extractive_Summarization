these stunning images reveal the @entity1 shining a light on the beauty of the @entity5 's @entity4 , with @entity6 appearing to offer a gateway to the galaxy , the images were captured by @entity10 - born photographer @entity9 , who has spent the last two years learning how to capture the night sky			1
the shots were all taken in rural @entity13 , one of the last remaining areas of the @entity5 to have avoided excessive light pollution from roads and cities			2
these sensational celestial snaps show the @entity1 in all its glory over a series of stunning countryside landscapes			2

this stunning picture of @entity26 captures the headlights from a truck parked at the cliff top which look more like beams from an alien spacecraft mr @entity33 ’s most recent photos , taken over the past month , include some of the county 's most iconic locations such as the renowned beauty spots @entity6 and @entity38			1
one stunning picture of @entity6 captures the headlights from a truck parked at the cliff top which look more like beams from an alien spacecraft			2
in another , lights from houses in the neighbouring villages of @entity47 and @entity48 appear to look like fire while high above the @entity1 looks like smoke			1
' i pride myself on taking different photos so i like to take pictures of the @entity1 above recognisable landmarks , ' said mr @entity9			1
' that 's why so many of my pictures involve @entity6 ( pictured ) , because so many people have been there ' lights from houses in the neighbouring villages of @entity47 and @entity48 appear to look like fire while high above the @entity1 looks like smoke			1
in order to capture the stunning scenes , self - taught mr @entity9 programmes the shutter on his digital slr camera to stay open for 30 seconds at a time to allow as much light in as possible boats in the distance casts a glow on the horizon , revealing the beauty of the @entity1			1

based on the immense gravity that would be required explain the movement of stars and the energy expelled , astronomers believe the centre of the @entity1 has a supermassive black hole			2
astronomers believe the @entity1 was n’t always a stunning barred spiral			2
it formed into its current size and shape by ‘ eating ’ other galaxies			0
