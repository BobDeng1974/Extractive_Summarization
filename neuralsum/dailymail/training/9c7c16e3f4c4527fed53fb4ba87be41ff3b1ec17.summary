doctors call these mistakes faults or mutations			0
they can occur due to substances people come into contact with			0
or , they can happen because of mistakes that cells make when copying their genetic code before dividing into two new @entity68 of these abnormal cells die or are killed off by the immune system			0
it usually takes many years to gather enough genetic mistakes to cause cancer			0
but it is possible to be born with a gene fault that increases the risk of cancer			1
scientists have identified a number of these so - called ' cancer genes '			2
the first genes to be found were @entity17 1 and brca 2 - women with these genes have a 50 to 80 per cent chance of getting breast cancer in their lifetime			1
women who tests positive can either have regular breast screenings or have surgery to remove their breasts ( and possibly ovaries )			0
