innocent : @entity10 the dog is dressed up as a giant spider before being let loose on the unsuspecting public harmless : the terrifying pooch sets off to cause havoc on the streets of @entity13 at night deadly : @entity36 stands on top of a lifeless man in an elevator - waiting to pounce on its next victims in one scene , a man taking out his garbage flees for his life when @entity36 emerges from behind a door , while in another , two girls scream and run after seeing the creature atop a lifeless man in an elevator			1
later in the video , a couple spot a flinching man wrapped up in a ' spider web ' hanging from a tree in a park and the man bravely creeps towards it , while his girlfriend stays rooted in her position			2
but his courage is quickly forgotten when @entity9 emerges from the shadows - and chases him right out of the park			1
