@entity0 cares little that @entity2 's eight - point advantage over @entity3 has been cut to three at the halfway stage of the @entity6 season			1
and the @entity2 boss and his players looked in high spirits ahead of the @entity11 trip to @entity12 as they braced the cold weather during a training session on wednesday morning			1
@entity15 , in particular , appeared to be enjoying the session as the @entity18 captain was left in stitches after the players piled on top of @entity22 at @entity23			1
@entity15 is in stitches as the @entity2 players enjoy a joke at training on wednesday morning manager @entity0 was in high spirits too as he shared a joke with his players @entity2 have been pace - setters since their opening win at @entity31 , with only @entity11 opponents @entity12 temporarily overtaking them on goal difference after two rounds of matches			1
now , after playing all the other 19 teams in the @entity6 and ahead of the first return fixture of the season , @entity0 has reflected on a strong start by his side			0
' everybody starts with the same points and if we have one more point than them ( @entity3 ) , we did well , ' @entity0 said			0
' we are top of the league at the end of the first round because we deserve it and because it is a consequence of what we did			0
striker @entity53 takes a tumble during the session , much to the amusement of @entity57 @entity2 players pile on top of @entity22 as the squad lark about in training ' @entity2 is playing very well since the beginning of the season			1
that 's the only thing we work at , the only thing we concentrate on			0
' and in the second part of the season we are going to try to do exactly the same thing			0
' against @entity12 , we will be there again trying to get a good result			2
' @entity0 is chasing a third @entity6 title and @entity2 's first in five years			2
seven times he has led a championship on christmas day - in @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 and @entity76 - and each time his team has gone on to win the title			0
@entity2 dropped points for the fourth time this season against @entity81 on sunday @entity2 , who were eight points clear of defending champions @entity3 during november , are indebted to @entity31 that their lead was not cut to a solitary point			1
the @entity31 last sunday fought back from two goals down to draw at @entity3 on a day when @entity2 had earlier been held to a 1 - 1 draw at @entity81			2
@entity0 's men have drawn four times and lost once this season in the @entity6 , but won all nine of their home matches			0
@entity3 's revival has coincided with a difficult spell on the road for @entity2 , who have dropped points in three of their last four away games in drawing at @entity99 and @entity81 and losing at @entity100			2
@entity101 cancelled out @entity103 's opener as the sides drew 1 - 1 at @entity105 's ' we had very difficult fixtures away from home , ' @entity0 added			0
' we lost one game that we did n't deserve to lose ( at @entity100 )			0
' @entity2 's only other dropped points were at @entity3 and at @entity111 , who are 10 points adrift in third in what appears already to be a two - horse title race			2
@entity0 has a full squad to choose from for the trip to @entity117 to play a @entity12 side who are without a win in 10 matches against their @entity123 rivals			1
@entity12 have not beaten @entity2 since april 2010 .			1

@entity2 travel to @entity117 on @entity11 to face @entity12
@entity15 was all *smiles* during training as the players larked about
@entity2 boss said that his side deserve to lead the way at halfway stage
