@entity1 , 51 , was driving to work when the 40ft @entity14 poplar tree snapped in the @entity15 that lashed @entity16 last winter			1
bystanders rushed to help as the trunk fell on his car but it is thought he died instantly			1
an inquest yesterday heard the tree was on land owned by @entity23			1
but its position meant it was unclear whether its highways department or a contractor was responsible for maintaining it			2
as a result , it had not been subjected to regular safety inspections			0
fungal decay was found only after it had come down			0
tree expert @entity33 told the hearing the decay could have weakened the tree			0

there was extensive damage to building and power lines as well as travel chaos			0

however , @entity80 , senior asset manager at the council , said of the tree : ' our records show it does not form part of the public highway			0
' there are parcels of land that may be adjacent to the highway but according to our records do not form part of the public highway and therefore would not come under the regime of safety inspections			0
the scene after the tree fell on mr @entity1 's car last year during the @entity98 storm ' we have since determined that it is land owned by @entity23 but not designated as public highway			1
' mr @entity80 said if they had known who owned the tree it would have been inspected by the council 's property section and admitted it had ' slipped the net			2
' addressing the family , mr @entity68 said of mr @entity1 : " he was healthy , he was a good family man , working hard , enjoying his family life			2
' ' the sudden and awfulness of this is unimaginable			0
