these shocking pictures show the once gleaming winter sports palaces of the @entity2 lying eerily silent and deserted			0
a year after the $ 51 billion @entity7 , many of the key facilities built for @entity6 's extravaganza have been barely been used			1
while the pistes up the mountains are now often packed with skiers - the collapsing rouble means @entity12 have switched from the likes of @entity14 to the @entity15 - many of the key sites of the games appear to have little prospect of being filled again			1
the roof of @entity20 has been partially disassembled			2
incredibly it was only used twice - for the opening and closing ceremonies a view of the eerily silent lobby of the @entity27 hotel , which was packed with guests during the games but barely has a single customer now the @entity31 ( left ) , @entity32 ( centre ) and @entity20 ( right ) , amid one of the many empty car parks of the @entity37 complex the roads are quiet around the $ 51 billion complex on the edge of the @entity41			1
the company which owns part of it is about to go bankrupt the ski slopes around @entity2 may be packed with skiers owing to the collapsing rouble but few of them are staying at the @entity31 the @entity37 flame has long since gone out one year after the @entity7 was held			1
the park has been branded a ' museum of corruption ' local journalist @entity52 - of @entity53 - has strongly criticised the huge spending on the @entity37 project , including on - going costs as @entity12 is plunged into a deep economic crisis caused by @entity59 sanctions over @entity60 and the slump in oil prices			1
' one year ago was the opening ceremony of the 22nd @entity7 , ' he said			2
' but since then the olympic park did not become a @entity65 for tourists			2
' a few tourists do come but mainly to watch where the millions of dollars have gone			0
' i think it is the same kind of interest people have as in the @entity72 in the former residence of the [ toppled ] president of @entity60 @entity75			0
' in his comments on the pictures , taken on a recent saturday afternoon , @entity52 said : ' have a look yourself - @entity27 hotel is completely empty			1
' i enjoyed the view at @entity20 from the 8th floor			2
@entity82 's roof has been partly disassembled , so another 3.5 billion roubles ( £ 34.3 million ) was spent			2
' one more year of such an attitude and all this will turn into a banal dump			0
' he complained that the @entity87 - costing the @entity12 taxpayer £ 197 million - requires a budget of £ 9,900 a day to maintain , ' mainly for taking care of the ice '			1
a company which owns some of the key facilities - hardly used since the games - and is close to the regional authorities , is on the very edge of bankruptcy , he reported , citing @entity12 's leading business newspaper @entity98			1
grey skies glower over the park , surrounded by ragged patches of wasteground			0
it is far from a tourist @entity65 , with only handfuls of visitors no entry for cars to the olympic park , with the @entity110 on the left			1
at least two oligarchs involved in building the lavish facilities are dumping their toxic assets on the state - with @entity12 taxpayers picking up the bill the state is spending millions of roubles on having an ice hockey - team in @entity2 , which in fact has a subtropical climate the complex hosted the @entity12 @entity124 in october but @entity125 and co are now nowhere to be seen on the unused track a few tourists make use of a pedestrian walkway over the racing track			1
they mainly come ' to watch where the millions of dollars have gone ' the @entity32 seats 8,000 spectators and hosted the speedskating competition at the @entity7 but has barely been used since sealed rubbish bins have no one to fill them at the multi-billion dollar site , with the empty @entity87 ( top right ) in the background one of the corners at the @entity142 track with @entity20 and its only partially dismantled roof visible behind the @entity2 games were seen as president @entity6 's personal platform ' after the @entity142 race which cost the region 10 billion roubles ( £ 99 million ) , the olympic park is turning into a ghetto , ' he warned			1
' the ice plant near @entity32 is not used any longer			0
' from time to time newspapers write about the planting of greenery in the park but the truth is that it is dying			0
' why am i calling it a ghetto ? just look at all those iron fences			0
' apart from the cost of keeping the ice cold , ' the state is spending millions of roubles on having an ice hockey - team in the subtropical climate			0
as if we did n't have enough already			0
' @entity20 - built at a cost of £ 525 million - has been used twice only , he said , ' at the opening and closing ceremonies of the @entity7 '			1
both glitzy occasions won plaudits around the world and featured a prominent appearance by @entity37 gymnast @entity176 , believed by many @entity12 to be their president 's secret partner			0
' another $ 60 million will be spent on its re-equipment during preparations for the football @entity183 in 2018			0
' it is [ also ] a perfect museum of corruption			1
' this litany of facilities for which he sees little or no further use goes on			0
' the @entity87 cost $ 300 million - not used now			2
' @entity192 cost $ 35 million - there 's no sign of life and the toilets are not working			0
' the @entity7 , the most expensive of all time , ran from february 7 - 23 , 2014 , as the storm clouds of revolution gathered in neighbouring @entity60			2
the cost is still a massive headache for the increasingly cash - strapped @entity202			0
at least two oligarchs involved in building the lavish facilities - seen as an iconic symbol of @entity12 's recovery from communist poverty - are quietly dumping their increasingly toxic assets on the state - forcing @entity12 taxpayers to pick up the bill			1
@entity6 's critics see @entity2 , a year after the event , as evidence of the crony capitalism that shields @entity12 's rich and powerful businessmen from economic pain			2
hundreds of spectators swarm across the bridge to the olympic park during the games - a stark contrast to the deserted complex now a spectacular fireworks display brings the closing ceremony of the @entity7 to an end on february 23 last year since then the tower which held the @entity37 flame has not been troubled by another spark , lying dormant as a small band of tourists look on just three cars are parked outside the @entity234 almost entirely deserted park is a ' ghetto ' , according to one local journalist the $ 300 millino @entity87 , where the ice hockey competition took place at the @entity2 games			1
it costs £ 9,900 a day to maintain the @entity12 @entity124 last year cost a further 3.5 billion roubles ( £ 99 million ) to host but the track gets no use from other racers a single broken barrier stands outside the entrance to the @entity110 , now rarely used			1
the games were the most expensive ever held			0

the @entity7 of 2014 are a *distant* *memory* in the @entity12 @entity41 resort , with empty arenas left idle
@entity20 , the @entity87 , the @entity27 hotel and the @entity32 all sit in *ghostly* silence
skiers may still pack the slopes nearby owing to the collapsing rouble , but few are visiting the olympic park
the @entity142 track , which hosted the £ 99 million @entity12 @entity124 last year , stands dusty and unused
the company which owns some of the complex is about to go bankrupt , according to the @entity98 newspaper
at least two oligarchs involved in building the lavish facilities are dumping their toxic assets on the state
@entity12 taxpayers are picking up the bill for this ' perfect museum of corruption ' , according to a local journalist
