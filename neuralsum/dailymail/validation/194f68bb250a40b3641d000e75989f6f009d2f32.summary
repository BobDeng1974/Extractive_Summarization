@entity0 provoked fury last night after handing out lavish bonuses – including an £ 859,000 windfall to its former boss			1
the state - backed lender ’s annual pay report showed 110 staff received more than 1million euros ( £ 720,000 ) last year , despite it racking up a £ 3.5billion loss			1
this marked its seventh consecutive annual loss since the financial crisis , when it was rescued with a £ 46billion bailout from taxpayers			1
still on the books : @entity17 , left with a @entity18 , is set to pocket a £ 1million bonus from the @entity0 - one of around 70 , £ 1million - plus , payments in 2014 one of the biggest winners was former chief executive @entity17 , who pocketed £ 859,000 from a long - term bonus awarded in 2012			1
he handed in his resignation in june 2013 , after being pushed out by chancellor @entity24			0
last night the awards were branded ‘ excessive ’ and ‘ unacceptable ’ , with campaigners criticising mr @entity24 for failing to stamp out fat - cat pay at @entity0			1
to avoid a new pay row , current chief executive @entity29 waived his entitlement to a £ 1million fixed shares allowance introduced last year to bolster his basic pay package and dodge the @entity34 bonus cap			2
this restricted his total pay for 2014 to £ 1.85million			2
mr @entity29 has also waived his £ 1million allowance for this year			0
but yesterday it emerged he could still receive up to £ 3.9million for 2015 , including a long - term shares award of up to £ 1.6million that will pay out for several years			1
warning : @entity40 admitted it could be several years until taxpayers finally get their money back after seven consecutive losses he will also receive a £ 1.5million ‘ golden hello ’ shares payment in august to compensate him for bonuses he forfeited when he left his previous job at @entity48 in 2012			1
finance chief @entity49 received £ 3.1million last year , including a similar £ 1.9million ‘ golden hello ’ payment – this time for giving up for his old job at @entity52			0
last night @entity54 mp @entity53 , a member of the treasury select committee said the awards were ‘ unacceptable ’			0
he added : ‘ here is a bank that ’s not doing very well that the taxpayer owns and has underwritten , so why should these few not very successful bankers get paid so much money ? ’ the boss of @entity0 ’s so - called ‘ bad bank ’ also hit the jackpot as separate filings to the stockmarket revealed he received a £ 2million shares windfall yesterday			1
@entity69 , who is responsible for getting rid of the lender ’s most toxic loans , was among seven senior figures to pocket a total of £ 5.5million from bonuses awarded in previous years			1
the generous payout for mr @entity69 is particularly sensitive as he is responsible for shrinking the investment bank			0
there are fears that up to 14,000 jobs could be at risk			0
@entity82 , chief executive of the @entity83 ’ @entity81 , criticised mr @entity24 for not doing more to curb pay at @entity0 , which is still 79 per cent owned by taxpayers			2
he said : ‘ ultimately pay deals need to be approved by shareholders , and at @entity0 that includes taxpayers			2
in the money : @entity0 , which is based in @entity90 , pictured , has paid £ 7.6bn in bonuses since it was bailed out ‘ the chancellor needs to be far more engaged in the process than he is now , and ask the board to justify these salaries			1
‘ until the bank is able to stand on its own two feet , rather than being propped up by taxpayers , it should show more restraint on pay			0
’ mr @entity24 has admitted he made a mistake by not radically shrinking its investment bank when the @entity104 came to office in 2010			0
he was convinced by the bank ’s former management , including mr @entity17 , that it could trade its way out of trouble			1
‘ i certainly regret that , ’ mr @entity24 told the @entity111			0
‘ i did what i could to correct it			0
’ mr @entity24 also said he would look to start selling off @entity0 as quickly as possible after the election , but admitted this could take years			1
before the 2008 financial crisis , @entity0 was one of the largest and most aggressive banks in the world			1
the bank was founded in @entity90 in 1727 , but by the end of the 20th century it was a major player in the @entity124 too as the @entity126 capital became the world 's leading financial centre			0
@entity0 sealed its place at the top table of @entity126 banking in 2000 when it bought @entity132 , which dates back to 1650 and was considered one of the ' @entity135 ' retail banks in the @entity126			2
@entity136 , right , became chief executive of @entity0 the following year and pioneered a gung - ho expansion strategy with resources poured into its investment banking division			2
one of the biggest deals came when @entity0 joined a consortium to buy @entity144 bank @entity143 for £ 49billion , which was later revealed as a major overvaluation			1
with the advent of the 2007 credit crunch and subsequent global financial turmoil , @entity0 was exposed as being dangerously indebted and unable to meet its obligations			0
the @entity150 felt it had no option but to step in , and in october 2008 it took a 57 per cent stake in the bank in return for £ 37billion of new capital			2
as the bank 's losses spiralled and it required even more bail - out money , the state share of the firm rose to 82 per cent			0
it is now at 79 per cent			0
much of the blame for @entity0 's troubles was attributed to @entity136 , who was forced to resign and subsequently stripped of the knighthood he had received in 2004 .			0

former boss @entity17 is also set to pocket a £ 1m bonus from @entity0
@entity0 *announced* £ 3.5bn loss for 2014 - its seventh consecutive fall
yet around 70 *people* were still paid more than £ 1m , ' modest ' fall from 2013
the taxpayer *pumped* £ 46billion into the troubled bank after the 2008 crash
@entity40 says it could be years before bank could be sold off
