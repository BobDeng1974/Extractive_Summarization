father - of - two @entity9 , 34 , of @entity11 , @entity12 - who is a part - time professional surfer , plumber and lifeguard - took on the monster waves off the coast of @entity18 at @entity19 do @entity20 , near the sleepy fishing village of @entity22 at around 8am yesterday morning			1
married mr @entity9 , whose wife @entity23 and two children honey , six , and @entity26 , one , are currently braving the storm at home on the @entity12 coast , was towed into the waves by his @entity32 surfing partner @entity31			2
daredevil surfer @entity33 rides down what is believed to be one of the biggest waves ever conquered at @entity22 , @entity18			2
the exact size of the wave @entity33 rode is yet to be determined , but it is believed to be close to challenging @entity31 's feat from earlier this year			0
the incredible moment was captured from the hillside overlooking the bay by @entity45 photographer to @entity46			0
@entity47 surfer @entity9 rides an 80ft wave at the @entity19 do @entity20 , north beach , at the fishing village of @entity22 in @entity18 the married father - of - two took on the monster waves caused by @entity52 the duo work together in big waves by towing one another into the swells using a jet - ski , because waves of that size move so quickly it is impossible to paddle into the wave using just arm power			1
however , one female surfer , @entity63 from @entity64 , nearly drowned and had to be resuscitated on the beach when she fell on a wave and her jet - ski partner could not get to her in time			1
she was rescued unconscious and taken to hospital , where she was reportedly doing well despite suffering a broken ankle			0
@entity70 surfer @entity33 was also in the water taking on the waves and may also have ridden a record - breaking wave during the same session , but the exact height of the waves is impossible to tell and and quite subjective depending on the angle from which they are viewed			0
it is not the first time mr @entity9 has been involved in a surfing world record - two years ago he was driving the jet - ski when he towed mr @entity31 into a giant wave at the same spot in 2011			2
the beach is well - known in surfing circles as a mecca for huge waves because it picks up the full brunt of the violent @entity90 storm swells			1

he said he could hear the waves pounding the shoreline overnight from inside the beach house he is staying in , saying the monster swells were even making the walls shake			2
yesterday morning mr @entity9 and his team were in the water before light at 6am , along with scores of other surfers all trying to ride the biggest wave			1
mr @entity9 said : ' the storm that hit @entity47 last night started the waves hitting here last night			2
the house was shaking last night			0
we 're staying in a house on the beach and i 've stayed here before when it 's been big and the odd set made the walls shake , but last night the whole thing was just shaking all night			0
' crowds watch on as brave @entity131 surfer @entity9 glides into an 80ft monster wave @entity9 on dry land in @entity18 hours after taking on the monster waves but despite the ominous rumbling , mr @entity9 said he slept remarkably well and was in the water raring to go before light			1
he caught two waves before the potential record - breaker , which he believes was at around 8am , after he 'd been in the sea for about two hours			0
mr @entity9 described the moment he was towed - in to the monster : ' @entity31 heard on the radio that the third wave looked good so he just popped me in there in the perfect position			1
it was really bumpy , i spent most of the time just trying to stay on my feet , it 's like you ca n't go fast enough , it 's not like normal surfing			0
' mr @entity9 said it is hard for him to judge exactly how big a wave that size is , particularly as he is riding it			0
he said : ' everyone wants to put figures on it , there were definitely 80ft waves there today , some even bigger , it was ridiculous , everyone got huge waves today , it was frightening out there			2
@entity64 surfer @entity33 surfs a wave at @entity170 during a giant swell that hit the @entity18 coast at @entity170 , @entity22 , @entity18			1
the @entity64 may have beaten @entity175 's record for the biggest wave ever surfed at 30 meters that was broken last january also at @entity170 , @entity22			1
an unidentified surfer wipes out at a giant wave at @entity19 do @entity20 during a swell that hit the @entity18 coast , at @entity22 , @entity18 ' it 's a really dangerous place because it 's not a point break or a headland , it 's a beach , so there 's no way round and if you fall you 're left swimming in 60ft white water			1
' mr @entity9 did fall on the wave after the potential record - breaker because the wind had become really strong and was making the surface of the water difficult to ride			2
he said : ' it started to get choppy , i was n't gliding i was literally bouncing from chop to chop and i ended up catching and edge and just slammed down			0
i was under for quite a while			0
' mr @entity9 is planning on staying in @entity18 for the rest of the week as there are further big swells predicted for wednesday			0
' hopefully there 's more to come but with surfing you could wait ten years for it to get this big again , i just have to make sure i 'm ready when it comes			0
