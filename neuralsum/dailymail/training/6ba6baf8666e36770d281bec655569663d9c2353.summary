@entity0 will lead his @entity2 side into the @entity3 final tonight unaware that he and nearly every other international star at the tournament is at the centre of a multimillion - pound conflict over the future of football			1
the battle could mean the 2014 competition in @entity12 is the last time @entity13 can put on a finals with access to global football idols such as @entity0 , @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19			1
football ’s world governing body and top @entity24 clubs , represented by the @entity25 , @entity25 , have shared an uneasy peace through a contract known as a @entity28 , @entity28 , agreed in january 2008 , which controls the release of players to international matches			1
a senior source from the @entity25 , who along with @entity48 are signatories to the @entity28 , said : ‘ without the @entity28 the clubs wo n’t feel bound to release players to [ international ] teams from outside of @entity48			1
‘ the @entity28 is the recognition of a basic principle — the fact that players are club employees			2
the clubs release them for the commercial purposes of the fas belonging to @entity13			1
‘ but there is also a consequence for the clubs : the acceptance of @entity13 rules on the release of players			1
the @entity28 expires at the end of july			1
so what about when @entity2 , @entity12 and @entity68 call up players for friendlies or qualifiers then ? ’ top @entity24 clubs have provided more than 75 per cent of the players at this tournament			1
but they see august 1 as their opportunity to pull the plug on all involvement in any international football run by @entity13 , putting at risk the very existence of @entity32 ’s organisation			1
@entity13 have shrugged off repeated scandals over the years but the clubs ’ ultimatum could finally be what destroys them from within ; with no @entity3 , @entity13 would effectively have no income to keep them going			1
last sighting : a big shift by @entity24 clubs could spell the end for @entity13 's @entity3 revenue channels roar : @entity0 could win the @entity94 at this @entity3 , but we might be robbed of him at @entity96 2018 there have been signs of the impending implosion for years			1
in 2011 @entity101 ’s president , @entity100 , who is also @entity25 chairman , said : ‘ i do n’t accept any longer that we [ should be ] guided by people who are not serious and clean			0
now is the moment to intervene			0
because knowing something is wrong is an obligation to change			0
‘ i ’m not optimistic because they believe the system is working perfectly as it is			0
it ’s a money machine , @entity3 after @entity3			0
and for them , that ’s more important than serious and clean governance			0
’ the effects of the @entity25 ’s threat could be felt by @entity13 ’s subsidiary confederations within weeks			1
qualifiers for continental tournaments in the @entity118 , @entity119 , @entity120 and @entity121 are due to begin in september but clubs will feel within their rights to withhold their players from taking part			1
stars like @entity19 , @entity39 and @entity127 will still be able to play for @entity128 , @entity129 and @entity130 because separate agreements are in place for @entity24 nations through @entity48			1
withdrawal : @entity37 has lit up the @entity3 but only on the agreement of his release from @entity137 but guaranteeing player participation at @entity139 has cost @entity48 £ 120million — more than double the £ 41m @entity13 agreed to pay for the tournament in @entity12			1
yet clubs see the £ 727m sitting in @entity13 ’s bank account as having been generated on the sweat of the stars whose wages they pay			1
‘ it is £ 120m for @entity139 from @entity48 and £ 41m for 2014 , ’ said the senior @entity25 insider			0
‘ that is a huge difference			0
‘ there are no numbers at all on the table from @entity13 [ for the future ]			2
we have made assumptions from our side that there should be at least an equal amount if not more from the @entity159			0
’ there is a history of brinkmanship in football politics and there remains the chance clubs will be bought off by @entity13 in the short term , just as they have been in the past			1
but this time , the @entity25 ’s stance raises questions about whether @entity13 can afford to balance the clubs ’ interests with those of their own member associations			1
after announcing a profit of £ 42m at its @entity176 last month , @entity13 ’s president @entity32 distributed ‘ extraordinary success premiums ’ between the national fas and continental confederations worth £ 39m , meaning little was left over			1
top players : the likes of @entity39 's agreement goes through @entity48 but there is a huge disparity at the same time @entity13 promised to double that figure next year — when @entity32 stands for re-election as president			1
yet he could face revolt from within his own organisation if he overpromises to the @entity25			0
‘ they ca n’t give more money to the clubs than they do today to the national associations and the confederations , ’ the source said			0
‘ so they have to give more money to them than to us			0
this is a very difficult one for @entity13			2
’ indeed , despite the apparent willingness to talk terms with @entity13 , even if a deal can be agreed for the 2018 @entity3 in @entity96 , it would only be a temporary truce			1
all the signs are that a longer - term deal covering the @entity205 in @entity206 would be out of the question			0
the clubs are holding out on making space in the schedule even for qualifying for that tournament			0
‘ we have an international calendar up to 2018 , ’ added the source			0
‘ there has to be a separate discussion on the @entity3 calendar for 2022			0
that ’s due for september and november and the @entity25 is a stakeholder in those discussions			0
but there has to be a new @entity28 for those talks with @entity13 on the calendar to take place			2
’ thumbs up : but @entity32 and co will be worried about the consequences when the deal expires the world governing body is said to have ignored requests from the clubs to talk about the impending split since 2012			2
the source claims @entity13 general secretary @entity233 and @entity32 have concentrated on other issues			2
the source said : ‘ this matter has been on @entity233 ’s table for about two years			0
we approached @entity13 and spoke about an increase for 2014 and 2018 — they said 2014 was not touchable because they had budgets in place			2
this is very important for @entity13 but they seemed to think it was more important to finalise 2014			2
time is on our side			0
they ’ll be the ones without protections			0
’ another senior source at the separate @entity253 body , @entity253 , which represents 29 different domestic competition organisers across @entity48 and their member clubs , corroborated these claims			0
‘ these clubs are those who employ and pay the players , ’ said the @entity253 source			2
‘ they ’re the big clubs who will always be competing in @entity48			0
the clubs could say , “ let ’s create something else ”			0
they would n’t do @entity48 or @entity13 competitions			2
why even have @entity48 ? ’ @entity13 said : ‘ @entity13 remains , as always , willing to discuss with the @entity25 on these topics , as it does with all other stakeholders in the world football community			2
’ world star : could disputes between clubs and @entity13 see @entity19 miss out on a @entity3 record goal tally ?			1

agreement between top clubs and @entity13 that allows players to be released for international *fixtures* expires next month
top @entity24 sides see the expiry as the chance to stop all involvement in internationals run by @entity13
that move could spell the end for @entity289 - and @entity13
it is a huge power battle - but @entity13 will seek a temporary truce
clubs have long held concerns about releasing their players
