@entity0 and @entity1 received thousands in foreign payments @entity4 cash payments made to members of @entity6 were covered up by the @entity7 , according to @entity9 papers published for the first time today			1
thousands of pounds were transferred from the @entity11 to @entity0 and @entity1 in 1973 , in breach of strict foreign exchange controls in force in @entity15 at the time			1
but lawyers acting for the government decided against referring the case to the @entity19 ( @entity19 )			2
the forgiving stance is ironic given @entity6 ’ tirade against the @entity7 in their song @entity23 , written and sung by @entity0 on the revolver album			1
the payments were made via companies , including the @entity28 record label , set up by @entity11 businessman @entity29 , who managed @entity6 ’ finances after the death of @entity32 in 1967 until the band ’s break - up in 1970			1
files obtained by this newspaper under freedom of information laws show that @entity7 and @entity39 officials spent the best part of a year investigating the payments , which included ‘ loans ’ of £ 30,000 and $ 10,000 ( approximately £ 4,000 at the time ) to @entity1 and @entity0			1
a payment of £ 300,387 on behalf of @entity0 was also being examined			2
officials were alarmed to discover that neither @entity29 nor the two stars had contacted the @entity39 to get permission for the transfers , which were made in 1973			0
their failure to disclose the payments was a breach of the @entity51 of 1947 , which strictly controlled the flow of capital in and out of @entity15			1
in a letter dated december 5 , 1974 , an official in the @entity55 told the @entity39 that it should tell solicitors acting for @entity1 and @entity0 that a decision had been taken not to involve the @entity19			0
but the same official insisted that the @entity7 ’s role in the matter should be kept a secret			1
he wrote : ‘ in all the circumstances it has been decided not to refer this case to the @entity19			0
i suggest that you say something on the following lines : it has been decided that no action will be taken in respect of any exchange control infringements that have been revealed in the correspondence			1
‘ i should , perhaps , emphasise that it is important that the above phraseology is used and that no attribution is made as to who actually made the decision , ie you should not say the @entity7			2
’ in an earlier letter to the @entity55 , another official urged a speedy solution			0
he wrote : ‘ a great deal of work has been put into the formulation of an agreement to sort the mess out			0
’ the @entity6 pictured in 1964			0
documents obtained by this newspaper revealed two of the band 's members avoided legal action from the @entity7 's lawyers despite being given thousands in foreign payments in a letter dated november 22 , 1973 , solicitors acting on behalf of @entity0 and @entity1 conceded that the payments breached currency regulations			1
but the lawyers insisted that the two men had received the money in good faith			2
after the @entity6 split , @entity29 continued to work with @entity1 and @entity0 and in 1971 he helped the latter put together the @entity104 in support of @entity107 ’s work in that country			0
@entity29 was jailed in 1979 for two months for tax evasion after it was discovered he defrauded both the concert and @entity107			0
@entity1 ’s decision to ask @entity29 to manage the @entity6 ’ financial affairs was one of the reasons why the band broke up			2
@entity117 did not believe he was the right man for the job			0
in an interview with @entity120 which was broadcast last night , sir @entity117 said : ‘ we got to a point where we got really crappy over business ... for years i thought , “ oh , me and @entity1 , bitter rivals ” and all this stuff			0
