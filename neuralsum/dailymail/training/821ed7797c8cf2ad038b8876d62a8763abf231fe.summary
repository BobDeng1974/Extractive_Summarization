@entity7 and @entity8 were arrested yesterday on suspicion of their murder and police were allowed to detain them until 10am this morning before applying for extra time			1
their arrest came a week after police seized a caravan and minibus parked outside their home for forensic tests			1
the other identities have been obscured for legal reasons grief - stricken : @entity7 and @entity8 , the parents of six children who died following a fire at their home in @entity27 , appeared at a news conference the couple had broken down in tears at a press conference a fortnight ago as police officers described the attack that claimed the lives of their children			1
@entity36 , ten , and brothers @entity38 , nine , @entity39 , eight , @entity40 , six , and @entity41 , five , were all killed in the fire			2
older brother @entity43 , 13 , died of his injuries in hospital a few days later with his parents at his bedside			0
mr @entity36 had been hailed by neighbours as a hero for ‘ valiant ’ attempts to rescue his children			0
police have established that the fire was deliberate , caused by someone pouring petrol through the letterbox of the family ’s three - bedroom council house in @entity59 , @entity27 , before igniting it with a match or a cigarette lighter			1
sixth victim : @entity64 , 13 , died in hospital after his life support machine was turned off while mr @entity36 , 55 , and wife @entity8 , 31 , had previously been questioned as witnesses , officers said they were not ruling anybody out as the potential arsonists			1
after the parents were arrested yesterday , @entity72 assistant chief constable @entity71 appealed for the local community to help officers work out why the fire was started			0
he said : ‘ in view of the arrests , i would urge anyone who may have been holding back , not felt comfortable to voice their concerns or not had the confidence , to do so now			0
‘ it may well be that you have a little bit of loyalty to family or friends			0
i would ask you to put that aside in memory of those six children			0
’ mr and mrs @entity8 were arrested yesterday morning in @entity27			1
police are able to question them until 10am today , but may seek an extension if necessary to interview them further			1
the couple are believed to have been at home when the fire broke out in the early hours of may 11 , but some neighbours have said they were out			2
mr and mrs @entity8 have previously insisted they were woken by a smoke alarm and failed to save the children despite ‘ valiant ’ attempts			1
the caravan removed by police from outside the property last week is thought to have been used as extra accommodation at the family home , with @entity36 and mrs @entity8 often sleeping in it			1
after the arrests yesterday , police increased their presence on the road where the family live			2
tributes and gifts left outside the home were also removed			2
respect : well - wishers have left hundreds of cards , flowers , teddy bears and candles after a candlelit vigil mr @entity36 , a father of 17 children by five women , became known as ‘ @entity7 ’ in 2007 after demanding a larger house for his family			2
as news of the @entity131 ’ arrest spread among neighbours , @entity133 of the community group @entity134 , which has raised more than £ 10,000 for the funerals of the children , said he was ‘ gobsmacked ’			0
a close family friend and godmother to one of the children said she spoke to mr @entity36 on the telephone after his arrest and ‘ he ’s not worried ’			0
she added : ‘ he says it ’s protocol			0
they always have to do this so they can rule out close family			0
’ another friend , priest father @entity149 , said : ‘ this is unbelievable and very , very sad			0
the community is in total shock over the tragic deaths of six innocent children			0
’ search for clues : police prepare to lift the caravan on to a low - loader outside the burnt - out @entity8 family home in @entity59 , @entity27 video : police issue an appeal for information following yesterday 's arrests sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			1
