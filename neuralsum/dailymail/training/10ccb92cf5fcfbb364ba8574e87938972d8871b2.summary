the past rains might have caused havoc for humans , but have meant that a huge magnolia tree in @entity12 has blossomed like never before			1
@entity14 ’s widest @entity13 , which is widely considered to be the finest kind of magnolia tree , has not bloomed fully for the past five years but this spring has produced an array of magnificent flowers in @entity19 in @entity20 , @entity12			1
@entity14 's widest @entity13 has not bloomed properly for the last five years but this spring has produced an array of magnificent flowers in @entity19 in @entity20 , @entity12 while the pink tree is not the tallest in the country , it is thought to be the widest , and when it was officially measured 10 years ago , it had a spread of over 98ft ( 30metres )			1
its owners , @entity29 and mrs @entity30 , who own the gardens , think it could be as large as 131ft ( 40metres ) across now			2
late frosts have stunted the tree ’s flowering over the past five years , but the last six months of wet weather has transformed the tree ’s fortunes			1
one of the garden 's owners thinks that magnolia trees up and down the @entity14 have benefitted from the combination of wet and then warm weather will be doing well and that ‘ it ’s going to be a great year for them , @entity30 said			1
@entity46 trees are grown in the @entity47 and have large delicate flowers ( pictured left )			1
they are very sensitive to cold but have grown well in @entity20 , @entity12 this year ( pictured right ) in a deeper pink the flowering tree is not the tallest in the country , but is thought to be the widest and when it was officially measured 10 year ago , it had a spread of over 98ft ( 30metres ) garden volunteer @entity55 , 21 , is pictured ‘ last year it came into bud – they were large and looked ready to burst – but in march there was snow and the buds grew black and dropped off , ' @entity30 told @entity62			1
‘ the ground was covered in black buds			0
it was so sad ’ she added			0
in other years the tree has been hit by frost and only some of its buds survived so that it flowered in a patchy and meagre way			2
‘ but this year it ’s fantastic			2
it obviously liked the wet weather and the warm sunshine now - and it ’s not even fully out yet , ’ she said			2
mrs @entity30 expects the tree to bloom for two weeks , or even a week if the weather remains mild			0

the couple are opening their garden this sunday , march 15 as part of the @entity135 so that people can enjoy the spectacle			0
