enjoying the trip of a lifetime to @entity3 , university student @entity0 strokes a young tiger at a popular tourist attraction – one of the few places in the world where you can pet the deadly animals while they sleep			1
but just minutes after this photo was taken , another 400lb tiger leapt into the frame , knocking the 19 - year - old to the ground with its paw and sinking its teeth into her thigh			2
she was saved when keepers at the @entity21 sanctuary in @entity3 jumped between her and the animal , while her sister and travelling companion @entity24 , 21 , dragged her to safety			1
calm before the storm : @entity0 , pictured stroking a tiger - she would later be attacked by one of the big cats in hospital : following the attack , ms @entity0 was told she would have scarring for life eight weeks on , miss @entity0 is recovering at home in @entity34 , @entity35 , but can not walk unaided , while doctors said the four - inch wound will leave her scarred for life			1
the @entity40 student wants to warn others of the dangers of approaching the orphaned tigers , which are hand - reared by @entity45 monks at the controversial sanctuary			2
reliving the nightmare she said last night : ‘ i feel lucky to be alive			0
one minute i was petting a tiger ’s back , the next it turned its head and knocked me to the ground with its paw			1
‘ as it lunged with its teeth i felt an agonising pain on the inside of my left thigh above my knee			2
what happened next is a blur			0
but a keeper jumped in between myself and the tiger			0
then , while the keepers pulled the tiger to stop it attacking me further , my older sister @entity24 dragged me under my arms to safety			1
’ wound : ms @entity0 was bitten by a 400lb tiger the stunned teenager added : ’ when i looked down at my leg it was terrifying			1
all i could see was blood			0
’ two friends in their group immediately tied a tourniquet round miss @entity0 ’s leg to stop it bleeding			1
meanwhile , the @entity82 student who is studying for a degree at @entity40 was rushed to @entity3 ’s @entity84 where she needed ‘ tens of stitches ’ to repair the four - inch wound			1
she then had to remain in hospital for a fortnight after contracting an infection and high @entity91 sister , 21 , was forced to make the call to parents @entity94 and @entity95 , 56 , an architect			0
mother @entity96 , 52 a former nurse who now runs her own business , said : ‘ when @entity24 rang the first thing she said was ‘ firstly @entity0 ’s ok ’ but i was very upset			1
i could n’t believe it when she said @entity0 had been bitten by a tiger			1
’ but finally after a gruelling two weeks in hospital – when she was pumped with strong antiobotics - she was well enough to fly back to the @entity105			0
however , miss @entity0 was to spend a month in a wheelchair and on crutches			1
she is now learning how to walk again			0
eight weeks since the attack , she is still limping and doctors have told her she will have a permanent scar			0
miss @entity0 and her sister from @entity34 were in the first week of their trip of a lifetime in @entity3 , which they had spent six months saving for , when they visited @entity21			1
‘ i was nervous about going into the @entity116 , ’ says miss @entity0 , ‘ however , i was reassured by the staff that as the tigers had been hand reared , they were so used to humans they were completely tame			1
reminder of horror : the wound after being stitched struggling : @entity0 still can not walk without help ‘ they were also tethered by chains and the staff told me no - one had ever been seriously injured			1
’ after petting some tigers in an enclosure , miss @entity0 – who followed all the @entity116 rules such as not wearing bright clothes to excite the tigers - decided to go into a special area where she could wash the tigers			2
‘ we were given a talk beforehand and told not to touch the tiger ’s head and to remove dangly jewellery			0
we were then shown how to wash a tiger ’s back			0
’ it was while miss @entity0 was washing one tiger ’s back , it turned round and mauled her			2
she says : ‘ in hindsight i had an incredibly lucky escape			0
i could have lost my leg or worse			0
the @entity21 staff were very upset			2
they paid for all my treatment in hospital and visited every day			0
they explained the tiger was just being playful			0
however , i want to warn others going to @entity21 that the animals might not be as docile as they first appear			2

@entity0 was knocked to the ground and attacked at the @entity21 sanctuary
sister and friend dragged her to safety
left with four inch wound and is scarred for life
she still struggles to walk unaided eight weeks on
