' you become this advocate			0
all day , every day , ' she told the @entity24			0
out of his shell : since his change , @entity15 has revelled in his new identity and become a much more happy and content child psychiatrists are quick to point out that gender dysphoria is much more than merely effeminate boys or tomboyish girls			1
according to the @entity187 's @entity186 , people who suffer gender dysphoria experience ' a persistent and intense distress about assigned sex , together with a desire to be ( or insistence that one is ) of the other sex			1
