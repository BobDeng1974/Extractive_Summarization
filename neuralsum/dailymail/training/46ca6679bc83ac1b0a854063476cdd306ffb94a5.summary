sons and daughters grow up but they 'll always be a baby to their devoted mothers			0
it 's a touching sentiment but it can also cause friction between families when mothers ca n't let go of their beloved sons - particularly after they get married			2
it 's a situation that @entity9 , a journalist who lives in @entity10 , knows only too well			0
she says her relationship with her mother - in - law , @entity13 , is ' strained ' because she frowns upon the way @entity15 ' looks after ' her son , @entity16			1
appearing on today 's @entity18 , mother - of - two @entity15 , 41 , explained : ' @entity13 is quite traditional so when she arrives and i 'm working , she 'll ask " what 's for supper " and i 'll say " i do n't know , there might be some eggs in the fridge " or she 'll see a pile of @entity16 's un-ironed shirts			1
she feels i do n't look after him as well as i might			0
but @entity15 thinks it 's better if she also earns money			0
@entity15 said : ' i can understand she wants her son to be " properly looked after " but i think me bringing money into the family is more important that cleaning the skirting boards			0
' @entity13 admitted her and @entity15 's differing views stem from them coming from different generations - and possibly because she 's from the @entity51 while her daughter - in - law is a southerner			1
she confessed that she can be ' a bit outspoken ' when telling @entity15 if she does n't agree with the way she 's doing things - from the care of her son and grandchildren to the housework			2
she can also be tactless at times , for example , asking @entity15 is she could wear black to her wedding to @entity16 and once even commenting on her daughter - in - law 's figure			1
generations apart : the pair have different views on a woman 's role as a wife @entity15 recalled : ' i put on weight with a thyroid problem and she said " goodness you have put on weight have n't you ? " when i asked @entity16 to tell her not to comment about it , she said to me later , " you 're sensitive about your weight "			2
' @entity13 said she thinks it 's better to voice her opinion - even if it causes offence - as she believes ' if you bottle it up , it gets worse			2
' she admitted wanting to wear black to her son 's wedding could have been because ' deep down ' she was mourning losing him to his wife			1
@entity15 said her husband does n't get involved to resolve the differences between her and his mother			0
' @entity16 has got fed up , he thinks " you 're too grown up women , sort it out " , ' she said			0
commenting on the situation this @entity18 , relationship expert dr @entity98 said tension between a mother - in - law and daughter - in - law can be a ' serious issue ' that needs to be resolved as it can cause the break up of a relationship			1
family ties : married presenters @entity109 and @entity111 joked about their own family situation during the interview she said : ' interfering mother - in - laws need to stand back and realise they sound like that @entity118 character who no - one liked who always said " you do n't want to do that ! " ' the tricky relationship between wives and their husband 's mother is one writer @entity126 , from @entity127 , also knows well			2
she has written a book on the subject , ' managing your @entity130 : you and your mother - in - law , for better or for worse ? ' she previously told @entity134 that it 's important for women at war to remember that they both have the same goal in mind - their husband / son 's happiness			1
she told @entity134 of the mother - in - law - daughter - in - law dynamic : ' it 's an important relationship and one you might have to put a lot of energy into getting right			1
' it 's one where both are programmed to be mutually suspicious of the other			0
she wants you to be up to the job of looking after your son and you feel under pressure and sometimes insecure as you adapt to a new role as a wife and mother			0
' for daughters - in - law like @entity15 feeling the strain , she has the following advice : ' remember you ca n't change your mother - in - law but you can change the way you react			1
do n't prickle too readily or look for hidden messages			0
