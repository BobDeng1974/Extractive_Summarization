' i just wanted to get him out of the store and it worked , ' @entity7 told local station @entity43			2

the robber , who has not been identified , did not have a gun on him but did have a knife			0

' the guy looked like he was on drugs or something , ' @entity7 said backing off : @entity7 said that he took out the gun to get the robber to leave , which he did unharmed : @entity73 never actually fired the weapon but he was still fired in return @entity7 had worked at @entity6 for six years prior to the october 12 incident			1
