@entity1 defender @entity0 has expressed his shock at his team - mate @entity3 being omitted from the 23 - man @entity5 shortlist			1
@entity3 , who scored 31 goals in 33 appearances for @entity9 in the @entity10 last season , appears to have paid the price for his bite on @entity14 at the @entity15 , but @entity0 feels despite that he should have made the cut			1
he told @entity17 : ' i 'm surprised			0
i think he had a spectacular year			0
he 's a great player , he is one of the best strikers in the world and i think he deserves to be there [ on the shortlist ]			0
' @entity3 impressed on his debut for @entity1 in the @entity24 against @entity25 @entity26 ( centre ) celebrates alongside @entity28 after netting against @entity29 @entity3 impressed on his debut for the @entity32 giants , making an instant impact as he set up his side 's first goal against arch - rivals @entity25 , with @entity36 the grateful receiver			1
unfortunately for @entity3 and @entity1 that was as good as it got , as they fell to a 3 - 1 defeat at the @entity42			2
@entity44 's side will look to bounce back from that defeat when they entertain @entity46 on saturday evening .			0

@entity3 scored 31 goals in 33 appearances for @entity9 last season
however that was not enough for him to be *included* on the 23 - man shortlist for the @entity5
his bite on @entity14 could have been a reason for his omission
@entity1 team - mate @entity0 says he was surprised by the news and thinks @entity3 deserved his place on the shortlist
