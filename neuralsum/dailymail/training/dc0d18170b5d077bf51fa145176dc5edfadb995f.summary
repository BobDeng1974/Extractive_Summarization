by @entity0 published : 12:05 est , 24 december 2012 updated : 05:21 est , 25 december 2012 @entity4 's prototype @entity2 reusable rocket took a giant leap for commercial space flight last week when it rose 131ft and landed safely back on @entity7			1
the latest launch by the private space travel company , which has already run resupply missions to the @entity11 , is a major step in their ambition to produce a reusable space vehicle			1
in its previous two flights the @entity2 has managed to hover at six feet and 17ft before settling back down			0
successful launch : @entity4 's prototype reusable @entity2 rocket flew 131ft and hovered before safely settling back down on its launch pad @entity23 - based @entity4 documented last week 's successful test launch at their test pad in @entity26 , @entity27 , in a @entity29 video published last night			1
it was accompanied by a series of humorous tweets from the pioneering company 's eccentric billionaire founder @entity33			1
' to provide a little perspective on the size of @entity2 , we added a 6ft cowboy to the rocket , ' he wrote			0
powered by a @entity43 rocket and @entity45 engine , the 10 - storey - tall @entity2 rocket is designed to take off and land vertically - part of @entity4 's plant to develop a rocket that can return to a launch pad for rapid reuse			2
it has four steel landing legs with hydraulic dampers and a steel support structure to keep it intact when it settles back down to terra firma			0
vertical - takeoff space vehicles developed thus far rely on disposable lower stages , which adds millions of dollars to the cost of launching spacecraft into orbit			0
a new generation of reusable rockets that can launch , fly and land would dramatically slash the cost of travelling into space			1
in the 29 - second test flight conducted december 17 , the @entity2 rocket rose to a height of 131ft - around ten storeys - and hovered before landing safely on its launch pad using closed loop thrust vector and throttle control			2
mr @entity33 declared the launch a success , writing on @entity80 : ' no problemo			0
' perspective : the six - foot tall cowboy dummy that rode the @entity2 rocket all the way - and survived unscathed as well as the @entity2 project , @entity4 has already achieved the accolade of becoming the first private company to launch a successful mission to the @entity11			2
it 's first launch of its unmanned dragon capsule was in may , with a follow up mission to the @entity11 completed successfully in october			0
but mr @entity33 's even more ambitious long - term goal is to establish a colony on @entity96 , and he has said that reusable rockets like the @entity2 are ' the pivotal step ' in achieving that .			1

reusable rockets could slash the cost of commercial space travel
latest test sees @entity2 rise to 131ft and settle back down safely
@entity4 founder @entity33 says the tech could help establish @entity96 colony
