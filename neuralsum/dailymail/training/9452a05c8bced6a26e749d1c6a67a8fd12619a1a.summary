by @entity0 council chiefs have issued a 13 point checklist telling children how to play outside , it emerged yesterday			1
the ‘ outdoor play code ’ included instructions such as ‘ do n’t climb over walls ’ , ‘ try not to shout ’ and ‘ do n’t play in one place for a long time ’			1
children were also warned to keep their play area tidy , that playing on the roads could be illegal and to ask neighbours before going into their gardens to retrieve balls			1
a council has decided today 's children need a 13 - point checklist telling them how to play outside the briefing was posted through the doors of families in @entity21 , @entity22 , after a resident complained about several incidents of groups of children playing ball games on a number of local roads			1
a child kicking a ball into a resident ’s garden and damaging their plants is also believed to have triggered action from the council			1
within days , everyone in the area received a letter from the council to say children ’s play would be monitored and residents should read the ‘ outdoor play code ’			1
last night local residents were furious about the letter and branded the move ‘ ridiculous ’			1
a father - of - two , who lives on one of the roads affected , said : ‘ i was very surprised to get a letter			0
‘ there was an incident a few weeks ago , a ball had gone into a man ’s garden and some of his flowers were squashed			2
it was all tittle - tattle and then we receive this letter through the door			0
‘ the play code is quite condescending			2
the council have not given any evidence of how many complaints have been made and to what extent the damage is , if any			2
mother - of - two @entity69 , 55 , said she was furious over the council ’s letter			2
a child kicking a ball into a resident 's garden and damaging their plants is believed to have been part of the reason why the council took action ( file picture ) mrs @entity69 , whose two grandchildren , @entity85 , nine , and her seven - year - old brother @entity86 , live with her in one of the roads , said : ‘ i think this is absolutely ridiculous			1
they are n’t allowed to play in the street but there is nothing else for them to do around here			2
‘ i do n’t like my kids to play away from the door			2
i like to be able to see them so i can keep an eye on them			0
‘ this is a stupid set of rules			0
the people who created them obviously do n’t have kids or theirs have grown up			0
‘ they should back off and let the kids play			0
’ @entity22 mp @entity103 warned at the time that children should not be made to feel like criminals for playing in the outdoors			1
a spokesperson for @entity108 said : ‘ as a council we want all of @entity21 ’s children and young people to enjoy playing safely outdoors , especially in the long summer evenings			1
we have a great range of leisure activities and some brilliant parks and play sites			0
‘ but we also have a role to play in making sure neighbours get along together			0
‘ over the years , particularly in summer , we get complaints about a tiny minority of young people upsetting some residents			0
in order to be fair to everyone , we have a ‘ @entity126 ’ which we simply drop off in an area where there have been complaints			0
‘ this allows everyone to understand what is reasonable			0
