as the @entity2 season enters its final straight , a few unexpected names have risen to the fore as teams fight to either stave off relegation or strive for a top four finish			2
@entity9 attacking instincts have managed to get @entity11 firing again with three of his players making the top 10 in the @entity15 chart created by @entity16			1
meanwhile , @entity18 's improving form , which included a fine goal against @entity20 , has been silencing his early critics at @entity22			1
@entity23 , @entity11 ( @entity15 score : 34.4 ) the first of three @entity11 stars to have been reinvigorated by the arrival of new manager @entity9			1
the former @entity29 winger has been released from the shackles of @entity32 's previous reign and was back dribbling down the touchline this weekend while providing an assist in @entity11 's 4 - 0 hammering of @entity36			1
no 10 : @entity11 winger @entity23 is back doing what he does best under @entity9 the @entity16 @entity15 is the official player rating index of the @entity2			1
it measures a player 's contribution to the success of his team			2
the intention is to remove any opinion bias and only work with proven statistical measurements which become more accurate as the season progresses			0
so , what are the six indices ? 1			0
player 's performance per match 3			2
@entity56 , @entity57 ( 35.9 ) not only did the @entity57 defender win four tackles and make seven clearances during his side 's 3 - 1 defeat of struggling @entity63 , but he also managed to score			0
the sight of of a full - back celebrating in the style of @entity67 will still be etched in the minds of worried @entity70 fans			0
@entity71 , @entity57 ( 38.8 ) on his current form , @entity71 could earn himself a move to @entity74 ... wait a minute ! the speedy winger is one of several players to have risen from the flames of criticism this weekend with 16 passes completed in the opposition half to compliment his brave goal against @entity63			1
no 9 : @entity57 defender @entity83 ( right ) celebrates his goal against @entity63 a la @entity67 no 8 : @entity71 suffered a nasty collision with the goal post for his troubles of scoring against @entity70 7			0
@entity89 , @entity90 ( 39.5 ) the @entity90 ' record £ 10million signing was almost offloaded for a cut - price fee in january but has come good with five league goals since the close of the transfer window			0
his latest , which claimed the match winner in saturday 's 1 - 0 victory over @entity101 , ended a spell of four games without a goal			0
no @entity105 scores the winer against @entity101 , his fifth league goal since almost being sold in january 6			0
@entity108 , @entity74 ( 38.3 ) @entity109 's @entity74 are simply better when @entity108 is in the side as the cultured midfielder showed in arguably their best performance of the season against his former club @entity20 on sunday			1
@entity108 netted a rare headed goal but making 42 of 50 attempted passes for a completion rate of 84 per cent was equally impressive from the former @entity119 international			2
no 6 : @entity120 has been compared with @entity121 and was impressive this weekend 5			0
@entity122 , @entity123 ( 41.4 ) the @entity125 midfielder prepared for @entity123 's do - or - die @entity127 showdown with @entity128 on tuesday with an all action performance in the 3 - 0 defeat of @entity131			1
@entity122 scored the @entity133 second goal , provided an assist for @entity135 's third without ignoring his defensive responsibilities with four wining tackles and three interceptions to leave @entity123 fans believing miracles can happen at the @entity141 no 10 : @entity122 skids on his knees after scoring in an all action display against @entity131 4			1
@entity18 , @entity74 ( 45.7 ) at one time , it seemed as if @entity18 's only admirer at @entity22 was the manager who signed him , @entity146			1
but , despite being largely ignored by @entity147 , the @entity148 international has forced his way back into the side and received no less than a standing ovation after scoring a goal and keeping his passing tidy with a 78.6 per cent pass completion rate			0
no 4 : @entity18 slots in a left footed shot during @entity74 's best performance of the season 3			1
@entity161 , @entity162 ( 47.6 ) @entity162 's record £ 28million summer recruit has come under criticism as @entity2 clubs have come to terms with @entity169 's tactics this season			0
nonetheless , the former @entity172 battering ram has starred in @entity173 and taken his league goal tally into double figures with a strike supplemented by an assist in the @entity162 ' 3 - 0 defeat of @entity180			0
no 3 : @entity161 made an assist and scored his 10th league goal of the season against @entity180 2			0
@entity184 , @entity11 ( 54.7 ) @entity11 were the biggest winners of the @entity2 this weekend , which a 4 - 0 first half scoreline at @entity36 leading to @entity187 's eventual departure from the @entity188			1
whereas a shortage of goals was their problem under the previous regime , @entity9 has them firing on all cylinders with @entity184 once more looking like the striker that terrorised defences in his first season			2
no 2 : @entity198 finally shone for @entity20 against @entity63 on sunday @entity199 , @entity11 ( 49.6 ) the fleet footed forward tops this week 's @entity201 after his electrifying performance against @entity36 that gives @entity11 breathing space in the congested battle against relegation			1
he scored a goal but completing 25 of 28 passes , including 24 made in the opposition half , for a completion rate of almost 90 per cent is testament to the attacking verve that has returned to @entity213			0
no 1 : @entity214 ( right ) not only scored but managed a pass completion rate of almost 90 per cent			2

@entity11 's *resurgence* has seen @entity214 and @entity184 top @entity218 ( @entity15 )
@entity18 and @entity108 starred for @entity74
@entity122 put in an all action display ahead of @entity123 's @entity223 crunch
