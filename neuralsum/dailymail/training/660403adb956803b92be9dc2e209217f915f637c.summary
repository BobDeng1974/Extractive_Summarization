fifteen months ago , the planning for a mammoth summer @entity1 tour to @entity2 , @entity3 , @entity4 and @entity5 reached its final , most critical stage			1
a visit to sir @entity11 ’s office			0
‘ we really were not sure he would agree to it , ’ said one @entity1 source this week			2
‘ it was so big and contained so much travelling			0
‘ to our surprise , he smiled and signed it off in about four seconds			0
we could n’t believe it			0
within a couple of weeks , though , he had retired			0
he knew all along that he was n’t going on it			0
this time it is for real			0
@entity26 ’s repeated public utterances about the inconvenience of this month ’s visit to @entity40 have caused more consternation in some departments of the club than key figureheads are prepared to admit			1
less than two weeks in to the job and already @entity1 ’s new manager is causing feet to shuffle			2
to managers like @entity26 , the details are important			2
that is why on this tour , he has already tweaked the structure of a trip that was , interestingly , signed off by his new assistant @entity37 during his spell as interim manager last may			1
on arrival in @entity68 last week , for example , @entity26 declared that he wished his players to train in the morning , eat and sleep at lunchtime and then train again in the afternoon			1
to make that work club staff had to book a @entity73 next to @entity1 ’s training facility			1
similar arrangements have now been hurriedly made for this week ’s tour stops in @entity77 and @entity78			0
not in favour : @entity26 has admitted the club 's current pre-season tour has been an inconvenience partnership : @entity1 chief executive @entity83 understands the concerns made by @entity26 proud : @entity26 , alongside club legend and ambassador sir @entity85 , is delighted to be @entity1 's manager @entity26 has also been very specific about his players dietary habits			1
menus have been changed mid-tour			0
all this is a consequence of @entity26 ’s relatively late arrival at @entity1 after a summer spent with @entity93 in the @entity94			1
that ca n’t be helped and nobody at the club disputes the respected manager ’s right to have things exactly as he wants them on tour			2
certainly mistakes have been made			0
@entity26 and his players spent hours travelling to and from training in @entity68 while the game venue , @entity107 ’s @entity106 , was 90 minutes away			2
here in @entity110 meanwhile , @entity1 ’s schedule saw them face @entity111 in afternoon heat of 33 degrees on saturday			2
the underlying issue here , though is more fundamental			0
@entity26 — along with other coaches of his generation — simply resents these increasingly arduous pre-season trips because he feels they interfere with the key business , preparing for a @entity121 season			1
at @entity123 , @entity122 resisted long - haul tours for years			1
having relented , the @entity125 spent a visit to @entity127 two summers ago complaining non-stop about facilities			0
respect : @entity26 will be delighted to have a player of @entity133 's quality in his squad all smiles : @entity26 and @entity37 will be eager to get @entity1 back on the trophy haul as soon as possible this summer , meanwhile , @entity138 coach @entity137 insisted on a short - haul trip to @entity140 having objected – quite understandably – to the three - week epic in the @entity142 and @entity40 he was landed with on returning to the club last summer			1
@entity1 , though , have long since viewed pre-season tours as crucial to their business			1
they would not be the behemoth they are without @entity147 is a balance to be struck between the football and the money			0
@entity1 ’s chief executive @entity83 understands this and he and group managing director @entity153 would not try to force something on @entity26 that he is rigidly opposed to			1
but as somebody said this week , only half in jest : ‘ if @entity155 thinks we are going to start spending a week at a @entity157 training camp every summer , he will be disappointed			0
’ one only has to look at some of the numbers associated with @entity1 ’s current tour to understand its importance to a club who continue to thrive financially despite the weight of debt imposed by owners the @entity172 family			1
each of @entity1 ’s four games in the @entity175 here will net them more than £ 1m			2
just as importantly , though , the club are committed to an astonishing 100 ‘ engagements ’ over the fortnight , whether they be player appearances or community initiatives			0
pedigree : @entity26 will do everything he can to ensure @entity1 have success on the field outside the @entity106 last week , @entity40 fans queued unprompted for over an hour just to have their photograph taken in front of a @entity1 billboard			1
@entity191 striker @entity190 , meanwhile , arrived in the @entity40 and went straight to meet a disabled youngster who had been waiting for months to meet him			2
these commitments and dozens more like them do not , on the whole , make @entity1 any money directly but they deepen @entity1 ’s footprint around the world			2
they keep stellar sponsors like @entity199 and @entity200 happy , furthering a global ‘ reach ’ that is already believed to number 600million fans – half of those are in @entity204 – and sees them six times more popular around the world than , for example , the @entity208 baseball franchise			0
@entity200 , for example , the sponsors of @entity1 ’s @entity212 training ground , have 25 @entity1 engagements during this tour , involving 1,700 of their most - valued clients			1
when a @entity1 tour is taking place , traffic to the insurance company ’s website increases by a third and by 500 per cent on a match day			2
furthermore , their in - house experts believe that 34 per cent of their total business comes their way because of the @entity1 link			1
there are other startling indicators , too			0
in @entity229 - where @entity1 played in 2008 - traffic on the roads is 30 per cent lighter when they are on tv			1
in @entity234 , the birth rate goes up when @entity235 appears in red			0
reunited : @entity26 will pit his wits against close friend @entity137 in the @entity121 this season emulate : can @entity26 go on and become a club legend like former boss sir @entity11 ? numbers like this do not come about by @entity1 sitting at home every summer			1
the club ’s marketing and commercial strategy is aggressive , cutting - edge and , as a result , astonishingly successful			2
therefore , it needs to be indulged			0
on this tour @entity26 ’s players are wearing season 2014 - 15 shirts with ‘ @entity199 ’ on the front			1
a deal worth £ 357m between now and 2021 , the @entity40 car manufacturer want value and one of their privately - stated aims is for @entity1 to extend the company ’s standing in @entity204			1
the same goes for @entity1 ’s watch partner @entity259 , the @entity40 company having already said that extending their profile in @entity204 was their @entity263 reason for signing their own multi-million pound deal with the club last season			1
sports company @entity267 – who will begin to make @entity1 ’s kit again from next summer – also wish @entity1 to return to @entity204 and it seems unfeasible that another visit to key markets in @entity273 – where the club have 300,000 credit card holders – @entity4 and @entity276 will not be on the agenda soon			1
planning for next summer ’s tour will begin as early as october			0
it may well be @entity40 again in 2015 , with @entity280 , @entity281 and @entity282 the proposed venues			0
@entity26 will be consulted and already claims he has reached an agreement that will cut down the air miles			0
@entity1 , though , can do many things but can not bring continents like @entity204 , @entity40 and @entity288 closer to @entity289			1
@entity26 said this week that all he wants is ‘ balance ’ and that is only right			0
to get it , however , the famously rigid ‘ @entity293 ’ is perhaps going to have to bend a little .			0

@entity26 's arrival has already prompted changes at the club
the new @entity1 boss is not in favour of long - haul pre-season tours
he has already tweaked aspects of the club 's current trip to @entity40
the *62* - year - old must accept he wo *n't* be able to *dictate* certain things in regards to @entity1 's structure on and off the field though
