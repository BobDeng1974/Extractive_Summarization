by @entity0 for @entity1 this heart - stopping video shows the moment a baseball fan is saved from a flying bat by the peak of his cap			1
the unnamed @entity10 fan seems completely unaware that a baseball bat flung by his own player is heading straight for his face , despite dozens of spectators sat around him raising their hands to protect themselves			1
the bat , accidentally thrown mid-swing by @entity10 player @entity18 , flies towards the fan and strikes him on the head - but other than appearing embarrassed he seems to be fine			1
scroll down video the unnamed fan is struck by @entity18 's bat - but luckily it only hits him on the peak of his cap @entity26 ' @entity25 pitched to @entity10 player @entity27 , who swung hard at the ball pictures from the match show @entity18 has a tight hold on his bat as he prepares for the pitch but as he swings and slices his shot , the bat comes flying out of the player 's hands in the direction of the stand the hilarious pictures show @entity26 pitcher @entity25 tossing the ball at @entity18 in the ninth innings of yesterday 's @entity44 match			1
the batsman swings and slices his shot , with the ball flying off behind him			0
but just as the ball disappears from shot , @entity18 loses control of his bat , flinging it towards the crowd			2
as the bat soars towards the stand , the spectator 's raise their hands over their head - some in an attempt to catch the bat , others trying to protect themselves from serious injury			1
at the same time @entity10 players sat on the team bench below the stand dive to the ground , fearing the projectile could be headed for them			0
meanwhile one @entity10 fan , wearing a red shirt and black cap , is clearly not aware of the imminent danger and continues to stare out into the field			2
@entity10 fans begin to realise the imminent danger as the bat is flung towards them at high speeds spectators raise their hands over the heads and cower in fear , but one man seems completely oblivious the bat crashes into the man 's head , but luckily the handle only makes impact with the peak of his cap i 'm ok ! the man , awoken from his daydream , holds up the bat as the woman next to him clutches her wrist they both seem fine after the impact , and the bat can be seen resting next to the two @entity10 fans with the bat just feet away from striking him , a blonde woman sat to his left tries to block it , but fails			1
the handle of the baseball bat connects with the man 's cap , suddenly waking him from his daydream			2
luckily he seems unhurt , and laughs as he clutches the bat			0
meanwhile the woman sat next to him is holding her arm , suggesting the bat hit her too			0
@entity18 , who does not look like he is enjoying the incident as much as the fans , then walks over to get his bat back for the next pitch			0
the @entity10 went on to lose 3 - 1			0
@entity18 , who seemed less amused by the incident , then has to make a walk of shame over to the crowd he collects the bat from a steward and trudges back to the field for the next pitch , thoroughly embarrassed			0
