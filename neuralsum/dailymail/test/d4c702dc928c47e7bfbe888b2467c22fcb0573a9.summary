@entity0 says @entity1 deserves a chance to prove himself as a successful manager at a stable club			1
the @entity6 legend worked closely with @entity1 and coach @entity7 before the duo assumed the reins at @entity10 during four years of unprecedented turmoil off and on the pitch			1
charged with leading the club back to the @entity13 from the bottom tier , @entity1 finally resigned and was placed on gardening leave in december and is still earning £ 14,000 a week while his 12 - month notice period runs down			1
@entity0 says @entity1 deserves a chance to prove himself a successful manager at a stable club @entity7 , who reluctantly took over as caretaker boss before leaving in march to be replaced by @entity21 , is also awaiting a final severance deal which would free him up to work elsewhere			1
yet despite leaving the club under a cloud , @entity0 insists that both men have something left to offer in football , and he blames boardroom turmoil under @entity28 , @entity29 and the @entity31 axis for contributing towards an unmanageable situation			1
‘ i think they want an opportunity , ’ said the former @entity10 manager and chairman of his two former colleagues			2
‘ after working with them for a number of years and them getting the opportunity to go in and take over , which i got when @entity41 ( @entity42 ) left , the boys were always hoping they would get the opportunity			2
‘ there was no guarantee of that , but they got it , and you have got to say that the circumstances they worked under were probably the poorest of any manager at any time in @entity10 ’ history			2
‘ people can make their own judgments of how a manager does a job			1
all i would say is that everyone has to have support			2
‘ i got the support of @entity59 when i was manager at @entity10 and he was a big help to me			2
they never had that help , they did n’t get any help			2
‘ @entity21 ( @entity21 ) has come in at a time when everybody is looking a bit brighter for a change at @entity10			0
it is a good time for him to come in			0
@entity21 is now in charge of the @entity70 side and has impressed since taking over ‘ it certainly was n’t a good time when @entity73 took over			0
@entity28 came in and that coincided with @entity73 , i felt , not getting a fair opportunity			0
‘ it is very difficult to judge him as a manager under the circumstances that he worked in			0
i certainly would n’t have liked to have worked under them anyway			0
’ the @entity1 legacy has drawn unfavourable comments from supporters			1
signings such as @entity85 , @entity86 and @entity87 arrived on wages which were barely justified by their performances in a light blue shirt			0
some voiced doubts over @entity1 ’s tactical acumen while others asked why younger players were n’t given more of a chance to blossom in the lower leagues			1
yet @entity0 argues that both @entity1 and @entity7 deserve to be remembered for what they did during his own highly successful second spell at @entity10 , prior to the financial tsunami which plunged the club over a fiscal cliff			1
‘ i was the manager , @entity73 was the assistant manager and @entity7 was the coach and , for four and a half years when the club was well run , we did well , ’ said the former @entity105 boss			0
@entity0 believes @entity1 deserves a chance to prove himself a successful manager at a stable club ‘ i am not a miracle person , i could n’t run @entity10 on my own			1
the people that i worked with there did a terrific job			1
everyone has got strengths and weaknesses and i know theirs			0
‘ i read in the paper that @entity119 ca n’t manage			0
he had never managed a football club before , and neither had i when i took over			1
‘ imagine when you have never managed a football club before , going into @entity10 and being there for four years under the circumstances that they were in ? ‘ people say : “ he will ask @entity0 for advice ” but i had never been in that circumstance before , so how could i give him any advice in terms of how @entity10 were being run ? it is an unfair judgement for people to make on him because of the circumstances			1
@entity1 is @entity10 record scorer but was axed as manager amid speculation surrounding the clubs future ‘ @entity73 and @entity7 would take a lot of the training , and i read that he ( @entity7 ) could n’t coach			1
@entity7 is a terrific coach			0
he is excellent at his job and one of the most organised people i have ever worked with			2
yet i hear all these assessments			0
‘ if you do n’t get results , people make those assessments , but they are not correct			0
‘ for me , the main circumstance is why they did n’t work out under @entity73 and @entity7 , who did n’t want to be the manager			0
the circumstances were n’t right			0

@entity0 believes @entity1 deserves another managerial job
@entity6 legend believes @entity1 still has something to offer in football
@entity1 is still being paid £ 14,000 a week while his notice period runs out
