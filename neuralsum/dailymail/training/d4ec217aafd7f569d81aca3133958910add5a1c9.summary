by @entity0 published : 13:02 est , 29 may 2013 updated : 16:18 est , 29 may 2013 a flying dinosaur that lived about 150 million years ago has been dug up in @entity2			1
the @entity3 was roughly the same size as a chicken , was 20 inches in length and had tiny , triangular teeth			1
it was also covered almost head - to - toe in primitive feathers			1
scientists from the @entity10 in @entity11 say the complete fossilised skeleton throws new light on the evolution of birds			1
a new flying dinosaur that lived about 150 million years ago has been dug up in @entity2 , which scientists say throws new light on the evolution of birds			1
the @entity3 was about the same size as a chicken , had tiny triangular teeth and was covered almost head - to - toe in primitive feathers the chicken - sized @entity3 found in @entity2 is related to the earliest known flying bird , the @entity21			1
both were avialans - dinosaur - birds that diverged millions of years ago from the theropods of land dinosaurs such as the @entity27 and the velicoraptor @entity21 are the earliest known flying birds , thought to have been about the size of a modern - day magpie			1
they lived around 150 million years ago and developed flying abilities that are believed to have evolved from gliding out of trees			1
the first complete skeleton of an @entity21 was discovered in @entity36 limestone in @entity37 in 1861			0
scientists said the fossils represented the transition between reptiles and birds			0
the @entity21 forms the missing link , sharing sharp teeth and a long bony tail with small theropod dinosaurs , and a wishbone and feathers with the birds			2
unearthed in at a quarry in @entity51 , near the @entity53 border , it was closely related to the earliest known flying bird @entity21			0
both were avialans - dinosaur - birds that diverged millions of years ago from the theropods that included @entity27 and the velicoraptor of @entity60 fame			1
discoveries of feathered theropods over the past 20 years have questioned whether @entity21 was the archetypical bird - like dinosaur			0
now the analysis into @entity3 , carried out by dr @entity65 of the @entity10 in @entity11 and his colleagues , puts @entity21 back at the head of the tree of when dinosaurs turned into birds			2
dr @entity65 said the results support a ' single origin of powered flight '			0
this means that all the dinosaurs which eventually became birds decided at a very similar time to take to the sky , while keeping some of their defensive and hunting features such as tiny teeth			2
these features were later lost as the birds developed further and no longer needed them while in the air			0
he added traces of soft feathers comprising a bundle of filaments joined together are preserved along a third of the tail , above the neck and around the chest			0
the fossilised skeleton of the @entity3 bird was found in a quarry in the @entity51 in @entity2 , near the @entity53 border			1
@entity51 has proven a rich source of ' dino - birds ' over the years with the discovery and naming of dozens of types of species in the region the chicken - sized bird would also have had longer feathers designed for flight rather than show - and help it catch prey or escape predators - but these have not been preserved			1
@entity51 has proven a rich source of ' dino - birds ' over the years with the discovery and naming of dozens of types of species			0
as with many important fossil sites around the world , this region of northeastern @entity2 is believed to have been covered by a lake at the time and supported a complex ecosystem of dinosaurs , birds , fish and mammals			0
when some of these creatures died they floated to the lake 's bottom where they were preserved by the silt or buried by sudden , deadly rains of volcanic ash			0
the @entity3 , left , was a similar size and shape to the modern - day chicken , right			2
it evolved from land dinosaur theropods including the velociraptor			0
it was 20 inches long and had tiny triangular teeth dr @entity133 continued : ' this new comprehensive phylogeny , or evolutionary development , shows that point of origin avialans were already diversified in northern @entity2 during the @entity138			1
' the study , published in the journal nature , also places another family of small , upright , bi-pedal theropods called @entity143 as a sister group to the avialans			0
@entity146 - sized @entity21 developed flying abilities that may have evolved from gliding out of trees or simply running along the ground			2
the first complete skeleton was discovered in @entity36 limestone in @entity37 in 1861 and is a very important fossil , almost certainly representing the transition between reptiles and birds			0
this ' missing link ' shared sharp teeth and a long bony tail with small theropod dinosaurs and a wishbone and feathers with birds - making them the living descendants of @entity27 .			2

the chicken - sized @entity3 lived 150 million years ago , had tiny triangular teeth and was covered in primitive feathers
