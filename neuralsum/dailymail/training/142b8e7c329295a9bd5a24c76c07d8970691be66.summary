by @entity0 a frozen world , similar to @entity2 , that is circling just one of a pair of stars could improve the chances of finding alien life			1
the new planet , located 3,000 light years away , is twice as massive as @entity2 and almost exactly the same distance from its parent star as the @entity2 is from the sun. until the discovery , no one realised that rocky planets could form stable orbits round one member of a binary star system			1
planets orbiting pairs of binary stars are relatively common			1
until the discovery , no one realised that rocky planets could form stable orbits round one member of a binary star system			1
the second star in the binary system is also very dim			2
the two are only as far apart as the distance between @entity28 and the sun ' this greatly expands the potential locations to discover habitable planets in the future , ’ said professor @entity34 , from @entity35			0
' half the stars in the galaxy are in binary systems			1
we had no idea if @entity2 - like planets in @entity2 - like orbits could even form in these systems			1
' named @entity46 , the planet ’s host star shines 400 times less brightly than the sun. named @entity49 , the planet ¿ s host star shines 400 times less brightly than the sun. it has been described as the real - life version of ice planet @entity54 ( pictured ) featured in @entity57 sequel @entity58 orbits , and is almost certainly a lifeless world it has been described as the real - life version of ice planet @entity54 featured in @entity57 sequel @entity58 orbits , and is almost certainly a lifeless world			1
but the astronomers point out that the same planet orbiting a sun - like star would be in the ' habitable zone ' where conditions are potentially suitable for liquid surface water and life			2
professor @entity70 led four international teams reporting on the discovery in the journal @entity74			0
the planet was found by chance when scientists spotted an unusual signal in light from a ' microlensing event '			2
the binary system containing the new planet disturbed light from a much more distant star 20,000 light years away in the constellation @entity85 ( pictured ) two ' @entity87 ' planets thought to lie in the habitable zone of a @entity89 , a dwarf star just 20 light years from the sun , have turned out not to exist			1
researchers found that light signals that seemed to be from the planets were actually created by events in the star itself			2
a star ’s habitable orbital region is known as the ' @entity100 because conditions there are not too hot or too cold but ' just right ' to support life			0
astronomers announcing the news in the journal @entity74 were not disheartened , however			0
' this result is exciting because it explains , for the first time , all the previous and somewhat conflicting observations of the intriguing dwarf star @entity89 , ' said dr @entity111 , from @entity112 in the @entity113			0
@entity89 has three other confirmed planets , none of which lie within its habitable zone			0
this occurs when a star ’s gravity acts like a lens , bending light from a much more distant object precisely behind it			0
in this case , the binary system containing the new planet disturbed light from a much more distant star 20,000 light years away in the constellation @entity85			1
the planet caused a ' dip ' and distortion in the light signal which after computer analysis provided information about its mass , distance from the star , and orientation			0
data from a network of telescopes in @entity143 , @entity144 , @entity145 and @entity146 , were used to confirm the findings			0
' in gravitational microlensing we do n’t even look at the light from the star - planet system , ' said professor @entity70			2
' we just observe how its gravity affects light from a more distant , unrelated star			0
this gives us a new tool to search for planets in binary star systems			1
' the second star in the binary system is also very dim			2
the two are only as far apart as the distance between @entity28 and the sun. computer analysis by professor @entity166 at @entity167 , @entity168 , suggests the planet is @entity170 ( - 352 ° f )			2
binary star systems composed of dim stars like these are the most common type in the @entity175			1
so the discovery suggests there may be many more terrestrial planets out there , some possibly warmer , and even harbouring life			1
professor @entity70 added : ' normally , once we see we have a binary , we stop observing			0
' the only reason we took such intensive observations of this binary is we already knew there was a planet			0
in the future we will change our strategy			0

planet is twice as massive as @entity2 and has a *temperature* of -210 ° c
it is almost certainly a lifeless world circling just one of a pair of stars
binary star systems like these are the most common type in our galaxy
scientists say the discovery suggests there may be many more terrestrial planets out there , with some possibly warmer , and even harbouring life
until this discovery , no one realised that rocky planets could form stable orbits round one member of a binary star system
