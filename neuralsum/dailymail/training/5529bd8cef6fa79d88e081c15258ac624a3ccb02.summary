a family ’s missing pet dog has been found 10 years after he disappeared - and in the nick of time , as he was a day from being put down			1
the @entity3 called chance belonged to then 11 - year - old schoolboy @entity5 who was heartbroken when his pet vanished			1
he and his mum @entity7 put posters on lamp posts hoping to find the loveable black and white terrier			2
after disappearing for so long , chance is now reunited with @entity12 and lives with him at his student flat in @entity14 how chance had spent the last 10 years since vanishing from @entity7 and @entity18 s garden in @entity19 , @entity15 will always be a mystery but as time passed they gave up hope of ever seeing three - year - old chance again and bought another dog for @entity12 to play with			1
but a decade later chance was found weak and hungry in a city centre underpass and taken to a dog ’s home			1
because of his age and his condition he was going to be put down , but luckily a vet scanned him for a microchip and @entity7 ’s name and address came up			1
@entity7 , 44 , from @entity19 , @entity15 , said : ' it was like something from a children ’s @entity39 movie			0
' i had a phone call to say my dog had been found - i thought they ’d made a mistake because we have two dogs and they were both in the house			1
' then they said it was a black and white @entity51 - my heart leapt , i knew it was chance			2
because of his age and his condition @entity53 was going to be put down - but a vet discovered his microchip @entity7 said it was very emotional seeing him again after 10 years is certain he recognised his long - lost owners ' we went to the dog ’s home and recognised chance straight away			1
' and as soon as we said his name his ears pricked up as if he ’d never forgotten us			0
' how chance had spent the last 10 years since vanishing from @entity7 and @entity12 ’s garden in @entity19 , @entity15 , in may 2004 will always be a mystery			1
@entity7 said : ' we bought him for @entity12 when @entity53 was seven weeks old			0
we had him neutered , microchipped , the full works			0
' three years later @entity12 when to school and i let him out in the garden , i went back out to let him in and he was n’t there			1
' we knocked on doors , looked everywhere and advertised it on the internet and in local papers			0
' we did hundreds of leaflets and we never heard a thing			0
' the dog was found 20 miles away from home chance was found in a shopping centre underpass 20 miles away in @entity86 and taken to the city ’s @entity87			1
@entity7 said : ' it was very emotional seeing him again after 10 years - but i am certain he recognised us			0
' the dog ’s home told us he was in a bit of a sorry state and to prepare for the worst			1
' he was due to be put down so it was a case of : ' @entity100 ! get him out of there ! ' ' there was no way we could let that happen so we took him back to where he belongs			1
' @entity12 , now a 21 - year - old criminology student at the @entity109 in @entity14 , said : ' it ’s crazy - i never thought he would come back , at all			2
' his back legs have gone , he ’s got a few things wrong with him , he ’s just been really neglected			2
' but he ’s eating well and he loves going out for a walk			0
' chance has now moved in with @entity12 at his student flat in @entity14			2
he said : ' every time i leave he cries , i ca n’t leave him on his own			0
he ’s more than happy here though , he ’s pretty chilled out			0
' i just want to keep him going as long as possible now			0
if that ’s six months , ten months or two years i want to give him the best life possible			0
' a spokeswoman for the @entity87 in @entity86 said : ' it ’s always nice to reunite a lost dog with its owner			2
' usually they ’ve been apart for a few days or maybe a week or two - 10 years is incredible			0
