' they are not in any way meant to be sexual			0
the aim of this project is to raise awareness for breast cancer			0
if you find these images offensive please hide them from your feed			0
' each day we walk past people			0
these individuals appear normal but under their clothing sometimes their bodies tell a different story			0
' she added that self - examination was vital			0
' it can happen to you , ' she posted			0
one commentator @entity69 said @entity18 was not the platform for the photographs			2

mrs @entity0 has undergone a double mastectomy and full hysterectomy in november last year after being diagnosed with breast cancer ' for the people who think it ’s ' just not for them ' may just end up being the one who will wish one day they 'd payed a bit more attention when it happens to them , only worse because they chose to be offended instead of listening , ' ms @entity37 posted			1
' @entity100 is never a better option			0
' mrs @entity0 told @entity102 she was glad she posed for the photos			1
' and after the surgery i feel that i will live longer , and that is the best thing for not just me but for my family , ' she said , ' i really would n’t want to take away from people who are fighting that fight against breast cancer ; i was really fortunate given my family history and gene mutation that my cancer was n’t as aggressive as others have suffered			2
' despite the images being reported to @entity18 , mrs @entity0 has been advised the images will not be removed			1
hoping others will share their cancer stories , mrs @entity0 and ms @entity37 are looking for people to take part in the project			1

confronting : many of mrs @entity0 's @entity18 friends were offended by the images despite the images being reported to @entity18 , the social network has promised that they will not be removed ' we 're hoping to turn it into an exhibition and coffee table book , ' she said			1
she said while the images were confronting , the project 's message was the focus			2
" we 're concerned about getting out the message of being vigilant and responsible for our own bodies through confronting imagery , " she said			0

' ms @entity37 said the project 's success exceeded its expected reach			1
' we just decided to do a campaign - we never anticipated the reach so suddenly , ' she said			0
' even in my own photography i was thirsty to work on something more meaningful - cancer is an experience with life changing results			0
' the genes that could lead to cancer @entity159 and @entity26 are human genes that produce tumor suppressor proteins			0
the proteins help repair damaged dna and ensure the stability of cells ' genetic material a woman ’s lifetime risk of developing breast and / or ovarian cancer increases if she inherits a harmful mutation in @entity159 or @entity26 about 12 per cent of women in the general population will develop breast cancer in their lives , while about 55 to 65 per cent of women who inherit a @entity159 mutation and around 45 per cent who inherit a @entity26 mutation will develop breast cancer by 70 about 1.4 per cent of women in the general population will develop ovarian cancer in their lives , while about 39 per cent of women who inherit a harmful @entity159 mutation and about 11 to 17 per cent who inherit a @entity26 mutation will develop ovarian cancer by 70 tests that look for a known mutation in one of the genes and tests that check for all possible mutations in both genes are available as @entity159 and @entity26 gene mutations are relatively rare in the general population , those with a possible family history suggests are candidates for testing			0
