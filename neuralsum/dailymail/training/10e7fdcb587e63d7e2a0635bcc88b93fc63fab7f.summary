but one primary school pupil in @entity8 , south west @entity6 had somewhat different reason last week for being delayed			2
this boy became stuck when he tried to squeeze his body through a 10cm gap between a wall and a cement column			0
jammed : the boy 's head became tightly wedged between a wall and a column support : fire fighters were able to reach the boy from both sides as they attempted to free him after wriggling his way in , the top of his forehead and the back of his head became tightly wedged between the masonry			1
once his teachers realised what had happened to the playful schoolboy they rushed to help , trying to release him from the tight gap			2
but they could not make any progress and were forced to call the fire brigade on tuesday in a bit to extract the boy his unusual tight spot			1
the emergency service personnel tried to drag the jammed in boy from his concrete confines , but had to give up after becoming afraid they would hurt him			0
even small movements made the boy scream in pain , so they had to give up and come up with a new solution			0
eventually electric saws were used to cut away masonry so the boy 's head could be freed			1
afterwards cream had to be applied to the distressed child 's head where it had rubbed against the concrete			0
there there : cream is applied to the scrapped forehead of a @entity6 boy after he was freed from between a pillar and a wall			1

the *adventurous* @entity6 boy 's forehead became firmly wedged , leaving him in a tight spot
teachers were unable to free and more *drastic* action was eventually *needed* to free him
