the children of the late billionaire @entity1 have claimed that trustees allowed him to drain their $ 210 million trust to prop up his struggling newspaper , the @entity4			1
@entity5 , 51 , and her brother @entity6 , 48 , said in court documents filed in @entity8 , @entity9 last week that they were told at least $ 90 million would be left to them			1
but when the @entity12 - who were also left nothing in their father 's will - checked the trust 's balance after his death on july 4 this year , they learned that it was completely empty			1
in court documents , they accuse his three trustees of allowing their banking and oil heir father to use the trust as ' his own personal bank account ' and to cover the @entity4 's losses , even though it was their duty to preserve funds for them , the @entity20 reported			1
emptied trust funds : @entity1 , the owner of the @entity4 newspapers who died in july , used millions of dollars from his children 's trust to keep the publications afloat , they have claimed they are demanding an accounting of spending and a hearing is scheduled in the case for december 17			1
he left nothing to the pair in his will , which split the funds of his other trusts - estimated to be in the billion - dollar range - between his two foundations , the @entity50 and the @entity51			0
the trust in dispute was the only one that did not give him full control over how the assets were used			0
it was set up in 1935 by their grandmother , @entity58 , who said that it should be used for his ' welfare ' but that any amount left over should go to his ' issue '			0
if he did wish to use it , the trustees were expected to weigh up his interest with the interests of his children , the @entity20 reported			0
broken promises : @entity5 's son @entity6 , pictured left , said in his petition that he was told he and his sister @entity5 , pictured right , would be left at least $ 90 million in the trust from 2000 to 2004 , @entity5 took $ 130 million for the @entity4 and much of that sum came from the trust , according to the petitions			1
then in 2002 , he took out $ 19.5 million from the trust and then in 2004 , he took out $ 18 million			2
they claim that in 2005 the trust contained $ 210 million and by the end of 2007 , its balance was $ 140 million			1
@entity6 's petition says that the trustees assured him in 2008 that other funds were being used for the newspaper , and that there would be $ 90 million left for him and his sister			1
attorneys told the @entity20 that if a trust is usually significantly emptied , the children might be asked to sign a waiver allowing it - but this did not happen in this case			0
in his petition , @entity6 called the newspaper as ' a waste of trust assets '			2
family fortune : @entity58 , pictured in 1955 , set up the trust fund in 1935 and intended for it to be passed down to her son 's children , they claim in their petitions which were filed last week @entity105 , an associate professor of law at @entity106 in @entity107 , who is not involved in the case , said that they might have a cause of action			2
he said they could seek to recover the money from their father 's estate that they think should have saved for them			0
the executor of @entity5 's estate , @entity121 , disputes the children 's claims			2
@entity121 is one of the trustees , along with @entity126 cousin @entity125 and @entity127			0
they will now have to convince the judge that they should not have to detail the trust 's spending .			0

@entity5 , 51 , and her brother @entity6 , 48 , claim that trustees let their father use their trust to keep the @entity4 afloat
