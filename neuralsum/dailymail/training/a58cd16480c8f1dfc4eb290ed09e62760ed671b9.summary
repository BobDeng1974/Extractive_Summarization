a two - year - old boy who suffers with a severe facial deformity and may never learn to walk or talk has baffled doctors with his undiagnosable condition			1
despite suffering with a number of distinct symptoms , medical experts are unable to pinpoint exactly what is wrong with @entity9			1
his mother , @entity10 , 40 , says that specialists are now forced to work out what is wrong with him by a process of elimination as test after test comes back negative			1
but they soon discovered he had been born with a grown and after three weeks he began fitting ‘ at first they thought it was @entity32 , but after a biopsy six months ago , the results came back negative , ’ @entity10 told @entity29 ’s @entity28			1
‘ but now they think it might be @entity38 syndrome			0
’ @entity32 is a genetic condition that @entity40 , the @entity40 , suffered from			0
@entity41 is also a genetic condition and causes blood vessel , skin and spinal abnormalities			1
@entity9 was born eight weeks prematurely weighing 4lb 10oz on boxing day 2010 after an uneventful pregnancy			1
he was immediately whisked away by nurses at @entity49 ’s @entity48 because he was premature			0
@entity10 and husband @entity20 , 35 , had no idea that their newborn son was in fact very ill with a rare condition			1
@entity9 had been born with a growth on his face , back and leg and three weeks later he started to experience seizures with alarming regularity			1
doctor then broke the news that he had suffered brain damage			0
@entity20 said the enormity of the his son 's situation hit him when doctors told him @entity9 was brain damaged and may never learn to walk or talk when @entity69 , 13 , ( right ) was asked what it was like to have a brother like @entity9 , he said : ' it 's just the same to have him as a brother			1
i look past what he looks like			0
he 's my brother ' ‘ that ’s when it hit home , ’ said father @entity20			1
‘ the enormity of it hit me when the words ‘ brain damage ’ were mentioned			0
' we realised he might never walk or talk and were worried he would never recognise us			0
’ the parents , who also have a son called @entity69 from @entity10 's previous marriage , were also overwhelmed when doctors gave them cpr lessons in case @entity9 stopped breathing			1
‘ you suddenly realise the responsibility of the little life you are looking after , ’ explained @entity20			2
doctors are unable to work out what is wrong with @entity9 and are hoping to diagnose him by a process of elimination			1
at one point they thought he suffered with @entity32 syndrome , a genetic condition that @entity40 , the @entity40 , suffered from			0
but tests came back negative.now they believe he may suffer with @entity41			2
there are only 130 people in the world known to have the condition			0
@entity38 stands for for @entity106			0
it was discovered in 2006 by @entity108 doctor @entity107			0
dr @entity107 reviewed decades of data and photos of children who had been given different diagnoses for a specific combination of symptoms			0
although the cases were rare , he noticed a definite pattern when comparing them			0
in 2009 , dr @entity107 published a paper describing his findings which established @entity38 syndrome as a recognised disease			0
there is currently no test for the condition and doctors must rely on recognising the symptoms to make a diagnosis			2
symptoms include skin , limb , torso and spinal abnormalities such as like fatty masses or scoliosis ( spinal deformity )			1
there can also be vascular ( blood vessel ) abnormalities such as a birthmark too			1
it is not entirely clear what causes @entity38 syndrome but experts have discovered that up to 60 per cent of cells in patients ' affected tissues contain mutations in a gene called @entity149			0
there is no known cure for @entity38 but many of the associated problems can be managed or prevented successfully with the right medical and surgical care			0
council housing finance officer @entity10 , 40 , admitted she never wanted a mentally and physically disabled child			2
‘ i always thought i was a bit superficial , i knew some people could cope with a disabled baby , i just never thought i was one of them , ' she told the @entity161			0
‘ but thanks to @entity9 i ’ve discovered i can because he gives me so much love and i know he loves his family to bits , ’ for @entity9 ’s parents now , the biggest worry is the unknown – not being able to put a name to his condition			2
‘ you wake up and try to work out if there is something different [ in his symptoms ]			0
but he ’s proved to us he ’s a fighter , ’ added @entity20			2
the family remain positive , especially as their fear that @entity9 would never recognise them has not been realised			2
@entity10 said that @entity9 recognises exactly who they are and that his face lights up when he sees his parents after a day at school			1
@entity9 's parents said they were worried he would be so brain damaged that he would never recognise them			1
but thankfully , their fears have n't been realised and his face lights up when he sees them			0
he also laughs and blows kisses to them ‘ he blows kisses , laughs and giggles , ’ she said			0
' we hope that once day he will walk and talk			0
’ @entity9 is due to undergo facial surgery at @entity198 in august this year			2
later in the interview , half - brother @entity69 , 13 , is asked how it feels to have a little brother like @entity9			2
he responded : ' it ’s just the same to have him as a brother			0
i look past what he looks like			0
’ @entity10 and @entity20 also explained how ignorant members of the public can be when they see @entity9 for the first time			1
@entity20 recalled one incident at the @entity210 when a person came up very close to @entity9 to look at his face			1
@entity20 then pointed out the the inquisitive man that the ' artifacts were on the wall and not in the pushchair			2
' but @entity20 added that he does n’t want to come across as ' bitter and twisted ' and said that he does his best to try and ignore insensitive onlookers			2
the family remains upbeat despite the emotional and financial strain that @entity9 's illness puts on the family			1
they say that @entity9 's arrival has been difficult but it has also been a blessing the parents said in a previous interview that @entity9 ’s condition has not just been an emotional drain but have provided financial problems too			1
@entity20 was forced to give up his job as a salesman to become @entity9 's full - time carer and @entity10 has taken a 20 per cent pay cut to her £ 25,000 wage after switching from full - time to a four - day week to help with @entity236 also fears she may be made redundant			1
@entity9 still needs nappies and has to be fed baby food , which push up the family ’s living costs			1
the couple are £ 10,000 in debt on their credit card and @entity10 said without a definitive diagnosis they can not approach the right charity for help or even set up an internet justgiving page			1
@entity10 added that because they do n't know if @entity9 will ever walk , their house may be unsuitable for them once he ’s too heavy for them to carry him upstairs to bed			1
' if i lose my job we will lose this house			0
if we knew what @entity9 ’s problems are i ’d at least feel there was some progress			2
but i do know that i love my son and just want to do whatever i can to give him the best possible life			0

@entity9 was born prematurely with a growth on his face and at 3 - weeks - old he started to suffer regular fits that left him brain damaged
doctors remain unable to diagnose him but hope to work out what is wrong with him by a process of elimination
they now *suspect* he suffers with @entity41 , a rare condition that causes blood vessel , skin and spinal abnormalities
parent say illness has been emotional and financial strain - father @entity20 had to give up work for become full - time carer and mother @entity10 works part - time
until @entity9 is definitively diagnosed they can not approach a charity for help and are in £ 10,000 of debt because of *increased* living costs
