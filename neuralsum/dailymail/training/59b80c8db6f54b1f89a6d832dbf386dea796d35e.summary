by @entity0 published : 07:51 est , 11 january 2014 updated : 10:15 est , 11 january 2014 the new @entity3 port welcomed the largest ever ship to enter the @entity5 this week , after a huge container vessel was diverted by bad weather			1
driven from its original destination of @entity10 by high winds and rains , the @entity8 was towed into port laden with goods from the @entity15			1
the port , in @entity17 , @entity18 , opened in november after a huge dredging operation made the river @entity5 deep enough to accommodate the very larger cargo ships which are becoming standard in the shipping industry			1
docking : the huge @entity8 container ship makes its way into the @entity3 cranes : equipment at the @entity3 , which only opened in november , can operate in high wind speeds the ship , which can carry as much as 8,500 lorries , and weighs 115,000 tonnes when fully loaded , docked in the new port on wednesday			1
when it was constructed in 2005 it was the largest container ship in the world , but has since been eclipsed a new model which can carry more than twice as much cargo			0
ships as large as the @entity8 have been able to venture into the @entity5 thanks to long - running efforts to remove some 27million tonnes of silt from the river bed			1
the change , which affects some 100km of waterway , now means that even the world 's largest container ship can comfortably dock just miles from @entity45			0
according to the port 's operators , the move will help keep the @entity52 competitive , as without the increased capacity the giant goods ships would have started stopping off in mainland @entity48 instead			1
after its time in port , the ship contained to @entity55 in @entity56 , and is currently making its way towards @entity58 in @entity59			0
close to land : the huge ship - which weighs 115,000 tonnes when fully loaded - is towed into port @entity62 : the ship can hold as much cargo as 8,500 lorries @entity66 : the ship was bound to @entity10 , but headed to the new @entity3 port instead a spokesman for the @entity3 said : ' the ship would n't have been able to come in before we dredged the @entity5			1
' you need deep water to get the ships in , so we have conducted over 100km of dredging , about 27million cubic metres has been dredged from the @entity5 , all the way up to the estuary and the channel			1
' and we have built @entity3 , which only opened on 7 november , for the large ships			2
this is the future of shipping – so to keep the @entity52 competitive that ’s what we ’ve done			0
cranes : equipment at the @entity3 , which only opened in november , can operate in high wind speeds ' we ’re hoping to get a much larger ship actually – the largest in the world			2
it ’s an 18,000 - container @entity89			0
' ' the way the ships run is they stop at maybe 8 ports then start the loop again			0
the vessel was n’t actually due to come here , but because of the bad weather over the @entity98 period we had a number of ships come that would have gone to @entity10 , due to high winds			2
' this was a @entity15 service , so would have carried electronics , textiles and things like that			0
it would have mostly been importing as there is not a great deal of exporting in the @entity52			0
' the whole reason @entity3 was built was to allow these ships to come in – if we had n’t built this they would have just gone to @entity48 instead			2

the 8,500 - container @entity8 arrived last week at the @entity3 port , which opened in november
it was originally bound for @entity10 , @entity122 , but made a *detour* to avoid the *effects* of high winds and rains
the ship could enter because 27million cubic metres of material from the @entity5 riverbed has been dredged
operators say the new @entity3 port will *protect* @entity52 industry , as ships would otherwise dock in @entity48
