by @entity0 published : 07:54 est , 3 november 2013 @entity2 : 13:27 est , 3 november 2013 professor @entity3 , pictured last year giving an honorary medal to @entity6 actor @entity5 , is tipped as a candidate to become the first female cardinal an @entity10 feminist is causing a stir in the @entity13 world as rumours are rife the married 49 - year - old could be set to join the world 's ' most exclusive ' club			1
@entity3 is being tipped as a contender to become the @entity20 's first female cardinal			1
a woman has never held the title , and while current precedence states only ordained men can be appointed to the role , @entity21 could be poised to make history			1
the leader of the @entity29 , elected eight months ago , has emerged as a liberal prompting speculation he will invite a woman to don the red hat and welcome the first female cardinal into the @entity20 's fold			0
the reformist @entity36 pope has made no secret of the fact he aims to increase the role of women in the church , calling for ' a truly deep theology of women '			2
for 700 years a pope was free to elect whoever they wished to the role of cardinal			2
pope @entity49 made his illegitimate son , @entity50 , a cardinal when he was 18 years old			0
historians say no woman has sat in the @entity54 's papal conclave since the position was created in the 12th century and cardinals were given the responsibility of electing the pope			0
in 1917 a canon law instructed that a pope could only appoint ordained men as cardinals			1
but church historians believe @entity21 could simply set aside that law and select a female cardinal should he wish to			1
no woman has ever been elected a cardinal since the position was created in the 12th century			0
the conclave currently consists of 100 elderly men a former @entity71 priest , @entity70 , was the man who first put forward the prospect of an imminent appointment of a female cardinal , when he wrote the idea was ' not a joke ' , in the @entity78 newspaper @entity77 in september			1
he quoted an unnamed priest as saying : ' knowing this @entity49 , he would n't hesitate before appointing a woman cardinal			0
pope @entity21 could be poised to make history by appointing the first female cardinal ' and he would indeed enjoy being the first @entity49 to allow women to participate in the selection of a new pontiff , ' the @entity83 reported			1
however , father @entity87 , the @entity49 's spokesman , has moved to downplay the speculation			0
he said last week : ' stay calm , no nominations of women cardinals are due			0
' pope @entity21 is expected to name at least 14 new cardinals ahead of his first consistory - a formal meeting of the @entity94 - in february			1
the conclave currently consists of 100 elderly males , criticised in recent years for their mismanagement of child abuse scandals			0
and while the debate rages , professor @entity99 , the vice-provost of @entity100 , is leading the pack of potential candidates for the historic post			2
while the academic has refrained from commenting on the speculation , colleagues have revealed her strong interest in theology , ethics and human rights			0
@entity112 , a @entity113 theologian , said : ' she 'd be quite radical			2
' one of her strong beliefs is something @entity21 has been hinting at , too : that the basis of moral theology starts from human experience			2
' pope @entity21 is expected to name at least 14 new cardinals ahead of his first consistory - a formal meeting of the cardinals - in february			1
speculation is rife a woman will be named among them @entity99 , who was a founding member of the @entity126 , is one of nine potential female cardinals listed by friend @entity128 , professor of theology at the @entity130 , on his @entity132 page			0
along with professor @entity99 , two candidates are from @entity71 , three are @entity134 , one is @entity135 , another @entity136 and the ninth is from the @entity138			0
were one of these women to be elected to the role by @entity21 , they would become the most prominent and influential female in the @entity29 , and could one day be elected to succeed the man who bestowed the honour upon them .			1

a canon law of 1917 states that only ordained men can take up the role
' @entity153 ' @entity21 could be poised for a ground - breaking appointment
