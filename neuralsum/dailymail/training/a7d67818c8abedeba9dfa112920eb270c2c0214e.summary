one summer signing is flying , but @entity1 will perhaps be more focused on the one who was crying			0
what a loss @entity3 will be to this side if the hamstring injury that wrecked his afternoon proves to be serious			2
it was the rapid winger who made the only goal of the game for @entity11 and the same little man who gave @entity13 the kind of twisting , turning runaround that leads to a sleepless night			1
not bad for 22 minutes of work			2
but then his hamstring went and turned a game that was looking one - sided into something far more even			1
goal : @entity11 13 booked : @entity42 @entity24 ( 5 - 3 - 2 ) : @entity26 6 ; @entity55 5 , @entity13 4.5 , @entity56 6 , @entity57 5.5 , @entity58 5.5 ( @entity59 45 , 6.5 ) ; @entity60 6 , @entity61 6 , @entity62 6.5 ( @entity63 78 ) ; @entity64 7 , @entity65 6.5			1
subs not used : @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 , given , @entity70			0
booked : @entity57 , @entity61 , @entity13 , @entity64 referee : @entity72 6 attendance : 20,683 @entity74 : @entity11 click here for all the stats , goals - including @entity11 's heat map ( above ) he left the pitch in tears and with a salute from @entity11 , who represents the best of @entity84 ’s summer spending but is being pursued in that particular contest by the @entity86 with the fast feet			1
on that score , @entity37 is none too shabby either and his late saves meant @entity91 ’s side suffered only their second league defeat in eight games			1
@entity91 could barely believe it ; @entity95 bristled at the subsequent suggestion his side got away with it			1
‘ i do n’t feel fortunate at all , ’ he said			0
‘ we were the better team			0
' perhaps his answer was coloured by thoughts of @entity3			0
‘ it was n’t good when he was holding his leg we will scan him and hopefully it is not serious , ’ @entity84 said			0
‘ we will find out in the next 24 hours if it is serious , but i really hope not because he has been fantastic for us			2
’ how @entity91 could use a bit of that creative spark			1
here , it was the obvious omission from a side that had the best of the possession and a number of reasonable chances , but left with nothing tangible			2
@entity91 , the architect of numerous recent changes to this side ’s style , drew the comparison to @entity1 ’s passing game , but it will not be lost on him that @entity24 struggled with a problem that has often in past seasons affected the team they were playing – how to turn passes into goals			1
@entity11 celebrates after scoring a fabulous free - kick past @entity127 goalkeeper @entity26 @entity1 midfielder @entity3 was forced off in the 22nd minute after picking up a hamstring injury ‘ i am proud of them for the way they played , ’ @entity91 said			1
‘ we did to @entity1 what they do to most teams here			0
we out - passed them			2
‘ we have changed the way we play and the lads are enjoying their football			0
sometimes you lose and say we deserved nothing			0
but i go away from here disappointed to lose but delighted by the football			0
’ words echoed by many @entity1 managers in previous seasons , though not so much in this increasingly promising campaign			0
so much of that is down to cutting edges like @entity3 and @entity11			1
on a soaked , slow pitch , @entity3 was somehow producing one of his finest performances of the season			0
the left winger was repeatedly picked out by team - mates with the sole intention of setting him free against @entity13			2
@entity24 hardly helped themselves by deploying @entity55 so far up the field as a wing - back and in the extra space @entity3 tormented @entity13			1
within minutes of the start he had beaten him on the inside and out			2
for good measure , the 5ft 7in winger also beat @entity55 to a cross and headed over , before winning the free - kick that @entity11 used to put @entity1 ahead on 13 minutes			1
@entity3 had collected the ball on the left and beaten @entity55 and @entity60 before @entity13 brought him down outside the area			0
@entity11 ’s free - kick for his third goal of the season was brilliant			1
@entity48 celebrates scoring a goal that was later disallowed during the @entity176 encounter at the @entity177 @entity24 midfielder @entity60 comes away with the ball after evading a challenge from @entity11 sadly for @entity1 , @entity3 ’s game was soon up			1
he had just slalomed through a crowd of @entity24 defenders and pulled back a cross for @entity48 when his hamstring pinged			2
that incident took hefty pressure off @entity24 and they improved			2
@entity65 went close with a free - kick and @entity58 could not improvise enough to turn in a bouncing cross from @entity62			1
their cause was helped by @entity40 missing an easy header and @entity42 having one of those days when his mind seemed elsewhere			0
the 22 - year - old ’s talent is not in dispute , though for how long can that - and his age - be a robust defence against his inconsistency and errors of thought ? the unnecessary decision to pull down @entity64 in the first half illustrated the point			0
he was booked and then substituted for @entity43 early in the second half			0
@entity24 brought on @entity59 at half - time and the extra attacking threat caused yet more pressure			1
@entity64 had a reasonable shout for a penalty ignored and @entity59 also scuffed a decent opening before a @entity37 save from @entity65 at the death rescued @entity1			0
@entity91 suggested @entity24 deserved better and left as a defeated manager with a beaming smile ; @entity84 pointed out that @entity214 had an equally good chance to get a second for @entity1			1
he left as a victorious manager with a head full of concerns about a winger with a damaged hamstring			0
@entity24 boss @entity91 will be disappointed with his side 's defeat against the @entity225 outfit @entity62 and @entity214 battle for possession during the @entity229 clash @entity64 tries to get the ball under control while being challenged by @entity1 captain @entity40 @entity62 shields the ball as @entity45 attempts to win possession back for his side @entity1 striker @entity48 rises above @entity24 's defence to head the ball towards goal @entity64 talks tactics with @entity91 as @entity24 went in search of an equaliser against the @entity241 @entity42 attempts to evade a tackle by @entity65 during his side 's 1 - 0 win @entity1 goalkeeper @entity37 makes a point blank save to deny @entity64 @entity24 right back @entity55 ends up covered in mud after a sliding challenge @entity24 manager @entity91 shakes hands with his players shortly after the final whistle			1

@entity11 scored the only goal of the game in the 13th minute to give his side the three points
the @entity34 international struck a *curling* free - kick past the *diving* @entity26 to score early winner
@entity91 's @entity24 were unable to find an equaliser during the remaining 77 minutes
