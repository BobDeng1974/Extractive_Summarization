this weeks agreement averts a trial scheduled for next month , which means there will be no airing of such questions as how terrorists got through security before hijacking planes on september 11 , the best way to stop terrorists , whether there was any real wrongdoing and negligence and how best to preserve liberties amid such threats , @entity29 district judge @entity28 said			2

a spokesman for @entity10 , which is based in @entity154 , @entity155 , and is part of @entity157 , said in a statement the airline had ' vigorously defended itself in litigation brought against it by property owners and their insurers who allege that @entity29 should have done what the government could not do : prevent the terrorist attacks '			1
