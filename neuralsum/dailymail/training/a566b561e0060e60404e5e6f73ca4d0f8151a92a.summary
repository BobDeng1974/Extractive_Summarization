by professor @entity0 the rapidly spreading , deadly ebola outbreak in @entity2 is a cause for grave concern – although health officials stress that @entity6 need not worry unduly			1
it does , however , highlight how important it is to take precautions when visiting countries where there is a possibility of contracting diseases unheard of at home			1
here , professor @entity15 , head of the @entity17 at @entity18 and deputy chairman of the @entity21 and @entity20 , explains how to avoid everything from traveller ’s tummy , to something more serious			1
@entity38 seems to be a problem predominantly in @entity2			1
some animals there appear to carry the disease			1
outbreaks in humans probably occur as a result of eating the meat from those wild animals or handling carcasses that harbour the virus			1
@entity38 is then passed from person to person through direct contact with bodily fluids , either through intimate contact , caring for someone with the condition , or from being in an area where there is an outbreak			1
i ’m travelling in an area where cases have been reported			2
how do i stay safe ? quarantine arrangements are in place in those areas affected and must be obeyed			2
as a precaution , avoid eating ‘ bush meats ’ of any wild animals such as fruit bats or monkeys			1
other than that , follow the same advice we always give to reduce the risk of general illness and stomach upsets			2
practise good hygiene by washing your hands with soap and water and regularly use a sanitising hand gel , too			2
if you do travel to @entity2 and develop a fever , flu - like symptoms , feel generally ill or your temperature is raised , seek medical advice for a variety of reasons , including malaria			1
low - risk for tourists : yes , @entity38 is real , but it is only passed from person to person through direct contact with bodily fluids is sitting next to someone enough to catch ebola ? even if you were sitting near someone on a plane who was infected , you ’d still need to come into direct contact with their bodily fluids to contract the disease			2
if i suspect someone is unwell on a plane , what should i do ? it could be down to many ailments including flu , a stomach upset , or even a hangover			2
if someone was critically ill they would n’t be allowed on a plane , and if they fell ill on board , the pilot would seek advice			1
it would be irresponsible of passengers to cause panic because someone appeared unwell , but you could discreetly alert the cabin crew of your concerns			2
if i get ill on holiday , might i be stopped from travelling home ? if you had ebola you would n’t be allowed to fly home – you ’d be in quarantine and receiving emergency treatment			1
so i do n’t need to worry about ebola			2
but the family is off on holiday in a fortnight and we have n’t really thought about vaccination – what should we do ? it ’s important you have any required vaccinations six weeks in advance of your trip			1
if it ’s only two weeks , or less , until your holiday , go to your gp or local travel clinic immediately to be vaccinated			1
they ’ll tell you what you need for the country you are visiting			0
crucial : it is important everyone in your family has the appropriate vaccinations so once we ’re vaccinated , we do n’t need to worry ? it ’s important to be vigilant about your health when travelling			0
for example , if you ’re going to an area where malaria is prevalent , you may need to take medication to protect yourself from it			0
take steps also to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes , as this is how malaria is contracted			1
use a bug spray and sleep with nets over your bed			0
read up on the symptoms so you know if you develop any			0
there are lots of common ailments you ca n’t be vaccinated against but that can be debilitating , such as traveller ’s tummy , so being prepared is important			0
are there medicines or a first - aid kit that every family should take when going abroad ? stock a medical kit with simple items for cuts , grazes and sprains , and ensure you have antiseptic cream , antihistamines and sterile dressings for mosquito bites			1
also , carry painkillers , anti-inflammatories and loperamide to help stop diarrhoea			0
always pack sachets of rehydration salts as dehydration can be dangerous after a stomach upset or sickness			0
if you ’re going on an adventure holiday , you might need specific medicines , such as drugs for altitude sickness			1
i advise against buying medicines while in @entity2 – even paracetamol – because of the huge number of counterfeit products			0
what exactly is traveller ’s tummy ? a form of @entity226 called enterotoxigenic escherichia coli is the most common cause , and symptoms include diarrhoea , cramps and sometimes fever and nausea			0
food that ’s not cooked thoroughly , is n’t hot enough or has been sitting on a buffet for a long time and has flies on it is the main cause			0
can drinking a little of the local water help prevent me from catching traveller ’s tummy ? to get any kind of resistance takes months , if not a year			0
although food is more risky than water when it comes to bugs , i would still always drink bottled water or water that has been boiled			0
in @entity2 , i would boil and treat water with a dissolvable chemical tablet			0
can i take something before travelling to stop tummy bugs ? there are a number of probiotics and prebiotics on the market and some may decrease the risk of tummy troubles by up to 70 per cent			0
but you ’re more likely to eventually succumb to traveller ’s tummy in certain countries , and the longer you ’re away .			0
