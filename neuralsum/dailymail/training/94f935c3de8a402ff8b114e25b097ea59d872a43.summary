a mysterious object launched by @entity2 military is being followed by @entity4 space agencies over fears it could be part of a @entity8 project to kill satellites			1
@entity10 , which was tracked over @entity11 on monday night by @entity12 , has been making unusual movements according to amateur observers			1
the @entity15 reported that it has been moving towards other @entity2 space objects and is now being monitored by @entity17 - the @entity19 's space defense command			1
there are theories that it could be a civilian project used to pick up ' space junk ' or could be a method of fixing broken orbiters			1
however @entity2 did not declare the launch , prompting concerns it could be part of another objective			1
some believe that with the deterioration of @entity47 relations and the revived interest in space weaponry , this could make strategic sense			2
the anti-satellite program launched under @entity52 - known as @entity53 - was closed down in 1989			0
@entity54 , research director at think - tank @entity55 , told the ft : ' it could have a number of functions , some civilian and some military			0
one possibility is for some kind of grabber bar			0
' another would be kinetic pellets which shoot out at another satellite			0
or possibly there could be a satellite - to - satellite cyber attack or jamming			0
' however she added that : ' it would be odd if space were to remain the one area that [ militaries ] do nâ€™t get their hands on			2
' space race : @entity2 became the first nation to launch a satellite into oribit , with @entity79 in 1957 @entity2 became the first nation to put a satellite into orbit with the launch of @entity79 in 1957			1
but the @entity83 first put a man on the moon in 1969 and @entity2 has not yet done so			2
in 2007 , two of @entity79 's heirs , @entity88 1 and 2 , are headed towards the edge of the @entity90 after 30 years in space			0
six years later , they announced that they would be sending an unmanned probe to the @entity93 by 2015			0
the craft , called @entity95 , or @entity96 , will be carried by the first rocket to blast off from a new facility that @entity2 is building in its far eastern @entity99			2
the claims come the same week that @entity101 attempted to land on the surface of a comet			0
@entity105 's craft captivated the world when it touched down , but went into hibernation mode late on friday when its primary battery ran out of power			0
earlier this month , the @entity110 had to fly higher as to avoid @entity112 space junk floating in orbit			1
@entity2 has a number of satellites in the solar system , and has over ambitious space projects in the pipeline - including sending an unmanned probe to the @entity93 by 2015			1

the mysterious object was tracked over @entity11 on monday night
amateur observers have been following it as it moves across the *sky*
@entity2 did not declare the launch , prompting fears of its objective
other theories are it is clearing up space junk or fixing other satellites
