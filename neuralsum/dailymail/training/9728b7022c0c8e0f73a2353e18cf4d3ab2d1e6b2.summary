@entity0 feels criticism of @entity2 this season is totally unjustified			1
the @entity6 captain 's perceived waning influence has been highlighted as a factor in @entity9 's shaky start to the campaign			1
but @entity12 ' side were much more dynamic in saturday 's @entity14 derby and @entity2 's free - kick in the 65th minute appeared to have sealed victory until @entity17 struck a stunning late equaliser to earn a 1 - 1 draw			1
@entity0 ( r ) has leaped to the defence of @entity9 captain @entity2 ( @entity21 ) @entity2 has now scored nine goals in @entity24 @entity14 derbies , more than any other player			1
@entity0 said of his 34 - year - old midfield partner : ' @entity27 's still one of the best players in the @entity24			1
' there 's no doubting his quality			2
a lot of teams have been putting someone to man - mark him , which shows just how good he is			2
i do n't think he deserves any criticism			0
he 's been the best player this league 's probably seen in a long time and still is			2
' @entity9 had 24 shots compared to @entity40 's 11 and @entity41 , who got a hand to @entity2 's free - kick but could not keep it out , was certainly the busier goalkeeper			1
@entity2 scored a free - kick to open the scoring for @entity9 against @entity40 former @entity48 captain takes praise after being criticised for his performances this season @entity12 ' team have struggled to recapture the form that almost brought them the league title last season , but the consolation from saturday 's result was certainly an improved display			1
@entity0 said : ' it 's disappointing			2
the performance was very good , back to the level we expect			0
' the intensity was good all over the pitch , we worked hard , we were more fluent going forward and we made chances as well			0
and also we defended really well throughout the game so that was pleasing			0
' we did quite a lot of work during the week on defending and i think we showed just how well we can defend , so that needs to be the case from now on			0
' then with the goal , there 's not much you can do about that , it 's a great strike			0
' @entity12 had hoped for a similar spark to last season , when a 4 - 0 victory over @entity40 at @entity81 began a run of 37 points from a possible 39			2
instead , their bubble was well and truly burst by @entity17 's wonder strike and it was the @entity40 fans left singing in the stands at the end			1
@entity17 's unstoppable extra-time goal earned @entity40 a draw in the @entity14 derby but @entity0 is confident there will be no hangover with a busy fixture list ahead , starting with a @entity98 trip to @entity99 on wednesday			1
' i do n't think it 'll affect us because the performance level was very good , ' said the @entity48 man			0
' we 've got to take the positives out of that			0
the goal was in the top corner so we 've just got to keep going and keep playing like that			0
if we keep putting in performances like that we 'll win more than we do n't			0

@entity9 drew 1 - 1 with @entity40 in the @entity14 derby
@entity2 opened the scoring with a will taken free - kick at @entity81
@entity0 says @entity6 captain ' still one of the best in @entity24 '
