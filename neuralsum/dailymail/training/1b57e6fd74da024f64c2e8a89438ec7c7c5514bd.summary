by @entity0 published : 12:02 est , 1 june 2012 updated : 12:02 est , 1 june 2012 babies born prematurely are at higher risk of developing severe mental health problems as adults , warn researchers			1
a major study suggests those born after just seven months in the womb or earlier are at highest risk compared with full - term babies			2
they could be up to seven times more likely to develop bipolar disorders and at three times the risk of severe depression and eating disorders			0
increased risk : babies born more than eight weeks premature are ' 4.5 times as likely ' to suffer from a severe mental illness such as depression , bipolar disorder or psychosis but even those born four to eight weeks early are more likely to develop schizophrenia and bipolar disorders			1
the study , published in the journal @entity29 , is the first to show a link between prematurity and a broad range of psychiatric disorders in later life			2
the chance of pre-term babies needing hospital treatment for any mental health condition is 4 in 1,000 – double the risk of babies born after nine months in the womb			1
but the risk for very premature babies who spent less than seven months in the womb is six per 1,000 births			1
researchers at the @entity47 ( @entity47 ) at @entity48 and @entity49 in @entity50 believe subtle alterations in brain development caused by being born early could be responsible , rather than restricted growth or lack of oxygen during childbirth			2
doctors are concerned about rising numbers of premature babies – which are defined as being born at least three weeks early , when they have spent fewer than 37 rather than 40 weeks in the womb			1
previous research found that babies born three months early – before 28 weeks - were most likely to suffer medical complications , learning difficulties or other handicaps , leading to a £ 1 billion bill for extra health and education needs each year			2
doctors are concerned about rising numbers of premature babies - which are defined as being born at least three weeks early the latest study had data from nearly 1.5 million birth and medical records in @entity50 between 1973 and 1985 and identified all those admitted to hospital with their first episode of a psychiatric disorder by 2002			1
the researchers found that individuals born very prematurely after fewer than 32 weeks in the womb were three times more likely to be hospitalised with a psychiatric disorder at 16 years and older , compared to those born at term – 37 weeks or later			0
the risk varied depending on the condition - for psychosis it was 2.5 more likely , for depression three times more likely and for bipolar disorder 7.4 times more likely			0
the findings also revealed a smaller increased risk for moderately premature babies born between 32 - 36 weeks			1
they were 2.7 times more at risk of bipolar disorder and 1.3 times more at risk of serious depression but not more likely to have an eating disorder			0
lead author dr @entity100 , of the @entity47 at @entity101 , said ‘ we found a very strong link between premature birth and a range of psychiatric disorders			2
‘ since we considered only the most severe cases that resulted in hospitalisation , it may be that in real terms this link is even stronger			0
‘ however , it is important to remember that even with the increased risk , these disorders still only affect between one and six per cent of the population			0
’ she said ‘ we believe that the increased risk of mental disorders in those born very prematurely can be explained by subtle alterations of brain development			0
’ the team ruled out restricted growth or oxygen deprivation during delivery as possible causes			0
dr @entity100 said ‘ the strongest association we found in this study was to mental health disorders known to have a strong biological basis , such as bipolar disorder , further adding to the theory that neurodevelopmental differences in those born prematurely may play an important role for later mental health			1
’ approximately 1 in 13 children is born prematurely in the @entity140 every year , and as a group they are more likely to require extra school support and be hospitalised with a variety of physical problems			0
dr @entity100 said medical advances kept premature babies alive today who would not have survived 30 years ago			1
she stressed most premature babies would not be affected by psychiatric illness , but it was important to identify children who might be susceptible as adults at an early stage			1
they could be given extra support both pre-school and at school , she added , while doctors develop interventions to protect the brain when babies are born early such as head cooling .			0

study of 1.3m @entity50 medical records reveals that premature babies are more likely to experience mental health problems that extend into adulthood
