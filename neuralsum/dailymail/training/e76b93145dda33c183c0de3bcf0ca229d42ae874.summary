by @entity0 published : 18:33 est , 10 june 2013 updated : 03:30 est , 11 june 2013 @entity1 , who was jailed for the rape and murder of his niece in 1977 , has been granted tens of thousands in legal aid for his battle to gain the vote a killer who raped and strangled his seven - year - old niece has been given tens of thousands of pounds in legal aid to demand the right to vote			1
@entity1 ’s lawyers argued in the @entity12 yesterday that the @entity14 ’s ban on prisoners voting breached his human rights and @entity18 law			1
the case in the country ’s highest court was given the go - ahead despite the prime minister ’s insistence that the voting ban will remain in place			2
the case has already been heard twice in two other courts , costing taxpayers thousands			2
seven @entity12 justices are conducting a two - day hearing that will finish today , with a judgment expected later this year			1
@entity33 raped and strangled @entity34 in @entity35 in 1977			1
he was given a life sentence the following year and has served 35 years behind bars			2
a @entity40 killer , @entity39 from @entity41 , is also demanding voting rights in the same case , and has received legal aid amounting to £ 7,280			1
he was jailed for life , with a minimum term of 13 years , for the 1998 murder of @entity48 in @entity49			0
in an unprecedented move , the government ’s most senior law officer , attorney general @entity50 , will personally argue against the killers ’ case			0
he is expected to tell the court today the decision on prisoners ’ voting rights should be left to @entity59 , not judges			2
@entity61 have voted overwhelmingly to keep the ban in place , making clear their opposition to a @entity65 ruling that it should be overturned			0
that dates back to 2005 when @entity67 , a convicted axe killer , won his @entity69 case on the grounds that the ban on voting breached his human rights			2
the government is to respond to that case with a @entity76 that will be considered by a joint committee of both houses of @entity59 , but @entity79 has said the idea of giving convicts voting rights makes him ‘ sick ’ , and told the @entity83 last year : ‘ no one should be in any doubt : prisoners are not getting the vote under this government			1
’ innocent : @entity34 , who was raped and murdered at the age of seven at her home by @entity33 @entity1 ’s case was dismissed by the @entity93 in october 2009 and again by the @entity94 in november 2010			1
then , @entity95 said the issue was a matter for ministers : ‘ it is a political responsibility , and that is where it should remain			0
’ when details of the case first emerged , @entity1 ’s sister and his victim ’s mother , @entity105 of @entity35 , said : ‘ he gave up the right to vote when he strangled and raped my daughter			1
prisoners have enough rights and victims very little			0
’ @entity113 , @entity114 mp for @entity115 and @entity116 , warned the case could be a ‘ backdoor ’ legal route to prisoners voting			1
@entity18 law , which both men are citing , is , unlike @entity69 judgments , enforceable by @entity14 courts			0
he said : ‘ this is a dangerous backdoor attempt to use @entity18 law to impose a left - wing doctrine of human rights , and we must resist it at all costs			0
’ yesterday , @entity130 , for @entity131 , told the court that although the case was not a ‘ class action ’ , it ‘ may have implications ’ for others			0
it is feared that if the case is successful , taxpayers could be hit with compensation claims from inmates denied the vote			0
the @entity143 said : ‘ @entity1 was only granted legal aid after the @entity12 gave permission for his case to be heard			1
‘ anyone who applies for legal aid must pass strict financial means and legal merits tests			1
‘ the funding is being managed by a specialist team to ensure costs are carefully controlled			0
’ justice secretary @entity153 said : ‘ the government has made its position absolutely clear – we believe prisoner voting is a matter for national parliaments to decide			0
‘ the attorney general will strongly defend that position at the @entity12			0

child killer @entity1 gets tens of thousands in legal aid
he raped and strangled his seven - year - old niece in 1977
now he wants the right for prisoners to vote
