it is one of the biggest impact craters on @entity3 - and until now , scientists have been unsure how it got there			1
the @entity7 in @entity8 , @entity9 , is 39 miles long and 19 miles wide - and 9.3 miles deep			1
researchers have been unsure how it formed - but now say it was a giant comet , not a meteorite as previously thought			0
they say it was caused caused by a comet colliding with our planet over 1.8 billion years ago			1
the @entity7 in @entity8 , @entity9 , is 39 miles long and 19 miles wide - and 9.3 miles deep			1
it was formed by a comet hitting @entity3 1.8 billion years ago , researchers have found			1
following the impact , the large impact crater filled with magma containing nickel , copper , platinum , palladium , gold , and other metals			0
as a result of these metal deposits , the @entity7 area is one of the world 's major mining communities			0
due to the high mineral content of its soil , the floor of the basin is among the best agricultural land in @entity8			2
collaborative research led by geologists at @entity43 has found strong evidence that one of the largest preserved impact structures on @entity3 was caused by a comet colliding with our planet over 1.8 billion years ago			1
the findings of this ancient impact are particularly topical with the current mission to provide more information about comets successfully relaying images of @entity56 to the @entity57			0
a critical aim of the mission was to test whether the terrestrial hydrosphere was delivered by comets to an originally dry @entity3			2
in a recently published study in the international journal @entity64 , the @entity43 - led geologists explain the rationale behind their assertion that the @entity7 in @entity8 , @entity9 , was caused by a comet - and not a meteorite			1
comets are composed by dust and frozen gas and carry few heavy elements , whereas meteorites are solid rocks that delivered iron - loving elements , such as platinum , to a younger @entity3			2
by conducting geochemical analyses of the siderophile ( iron - loving ) elements found in and around the crater fill – and by modelling the impact with computer software – the geologists showed that whatever crashed to @entity3 was almost completely vaporised on entry			1
the large impact crater filled with magma containing nickel , copper , platinum , palladium , gold , and other metals			0
the @entity7 in @entity8 , @entity9 , is 39 miles long and 19 miles wide - and 9.3 miles deep			1
the @entity94 crater , @entity95 , @entity96 : 190 miles wide - created 2billion years ago the @entity7 , @entity8 , @entity9 : 160 miles wide - created 1.8billion years ago @entity97 , @entity98 : 120 miles wide - created 300million years ago a meteorite of sufficient size to create a crater as large as the @entity7 should only be partially vaporised on entry , which leaves a ' comet - as - culprit ' scenario as by far the most likely			1
professor of @entity106 in the @entity107 at @entity43 , @entity108 , said : ' our findings provide further evidence that some very large terrestrial impact basins were created by comets , which is important and interesting in the context of the early bombardment of our inner @entity116 – it might well be that comets were responsible for bringing volatile elements to the young @entity3			2
' the large impact crater filled with magma containing nickel , copper , platinum , palladium , gold , and other metals			0
an image of the basin taken from @entity130 in 1984/1985			0
it is the second - largest known impact crater or astrobleme on @entity3 , as well as one of the oldest			2
a shatter cone from the area , a rare geological feature that only forms in the bedrock beneath meteorite impact craters or underground nuclear explosions			0
the development of a mining settlement occurred in 1883 after blasting connected to the railway construction revealed a large concentration of nickel and copper ore at the @entity147 site			0
as a result of these metal deposits , the @entity7 area is one of the world 's major mining communities			0
the region is one of the world 's largest suppliers of nickel and copper ores , all found on the outer rim of the basin .			0

@entity8 crater is 39 miles long and 19 miles wide , and 9.3 miles deep
was caused caused by a comet colliding with @entity3 1.8 billion years ago
