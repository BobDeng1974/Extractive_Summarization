@entity9 , 25 , made two desperate calls to the emergency service before being murdered by her ex-boyfriend @entity12 , 19 , in august 2009			1
but ' individual and systemic failures ' by the police meant the emergency services arrived too late to save her life , the @entity13 was told			2
@entity9 's family is suing police for negligence after they failed to respond to her calls for help quickly ; she was murdered by her ex-boyfriend in august 2009 while she waiting for police to arrive ms @entity9 , from @entity25 , @entity26 , was heard screaming during her second call to police before the line went dead			1
the @entity29 has already ruled ms @entity9 was failed by both the @entity31 and @entity32 police as well as the 999 system			2
the commission said officers should have been able to respond to her call within five minutes			0
by the time they arrived at her home 22 minutes later she was dead , having been stabbed 72 times			1
@entity12 , 19 , was jailed for life for murdering ms @entity9 by stabbing her 72 times in a ' jealous rage ' the highest court in the land is hearing a challenge by ms @entity9 's family against a @entity49 ruling in 2012 that the police have an ' immunity ' from being sued for negligence under the common law for the actions of officers during ' the investigation or suppression of crime '			1
at the same time , the chief constables of @entity32 and @entity60 are cross-appealing against the appeal judges ' linked ruling that the family should be allowed to go ahead with a claim that their @entity66 rights under the @entity67 were breached by a police failure to protect ms @entity9 's life			1
@entity71 , appearing for ms @entity9 's family , said the case was ' desperately important ' , particularly with regard to cases of domestic violence			1
he told seven @entity13 justices : ' there is a need for a heightened accountability of the police in the light of recent scandals and investigations which have had a very serious detrimental affect on public and political confidence in police services			0
' mr @entity86 said the family 's claim was ' not just about money ' but also a ' determination to find out really and truly what happened '			0
@entity12 attacked ms @entity9 , whose children were home at the time , after breaking into her house ' in a mad fit of jealous rage ' after discovering she was in a new relationship just weeks after they had broken up			1
the court heard that ms @entity9 made her first 999 call on a mobile phone at 2.29am and told the @entity60 operator that @entity12 had come to the house and found her with someone else			1
he had bitten her ear hard and taken the other man away in his car - saying he would return to kill her			0
ms @entity9 , 25 , called police twice and was heard screaming before the phone went dead			1
she made it clear her life was in danger but police did n't appreciate the urgency of the situation			0
she was dead when they arrived mr @entity86 said the ' urgency was absolutely plain ' and an immediate response could have meant police reaching her in five minutes			2
but the call had gone through @entity119 - ' the wrong police force ' - and not @entity32 , as it should have done			0
the @entity119 operator told the mother - of - two to ' stay put ' in the house and keep the phone free as @entity126 would want to call her back , said mr @entity86			2
according to the appeal court judgment , the @entity119 operator spoke to her @entity126 counterpart and said @entity12 had threatened to return to ' hit ' @entity9 but did not refer to ' the threat to kill '			1
the call should have continued to be graded as requiring an immediate response , but was instead downgraded			0
a further 999 call was received by @entity60 from ms @entity9 at 2.43am and she could be heard screaming before the line went dead			1
police officers arrived at 2.51am to find her dead			0
@entity12 was sentenced to life in jail in 2010 after admitting murder at the @entity138			0
mr @entity86 told the court that the ' factual picture ' revealed there were ' crucial legal duties owed to ms @entity9 's estate by the police '			1
he argued officers had failed to arrive in time and possibly save her life because of unacceptable delays			0
these were caused by individual and systemic errors of the police which justified them having to face damages claims for negligence , he said			0
ms @entity9 's family are being supported by @entity154 women 's aid and the charity @entity155			2
director of liberty @entity156 said : ' @entity9 could be alive if the authorities had fulfilled their duties under the @entity160			0
' they ca nâ€™t be allowed to hide such failings under the cloak of police immunity			0

when they arrived 22 minutes later , following two calls , she was dead
during her second call police heard screaming , before the phone went *silent*
her ex-boyfriend , @entity12 , stabbed her 72 times in a ' jealous rage '
