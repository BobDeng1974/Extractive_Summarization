by @entity0 published : 10:55 est , 19 march 2013 updated : 12:54 est , 19 march 2013 high profile : @entity2 , which has the backing of @entity4 , will not reveal who its top donors are pressure group hacked off is refusing to reveal who is bankrolling them despite campaigning for more transparency in the press			1
senior members would not comment on claims that rich benefactors keen on greater media regulation were covering the costs of the group , which is supported by celebrities including @entity4 and @entity20			1
blogger @entity21 claims he has a list that shows key donors include @entity25 , mother of @entity26 and @entity27 and billionaire @entity28 , who was one of @entity30 's biggest financial backers under @entity31			1
another four high - profile donors were claimed to be philosopher @entity33 , tycoon @entity34 , hairdresser @entity35 and @entity37 star @entity36			1
mr @entity36 , who is alleged to have made a £ 1,000 payment to hacked off , denied this on @entity40 yesterday			1
the net worth of these rich and powerful men and women is far in excess of £ 1billion , and they may have helped support the parents of @entity46 and @entity47 from press intrusion			2
members were in front of the the @entity51 today , but were criticised for their performance			2
@entity54 mp @entity53 , said : ' the champions of openness that is hacked off refuse to name large private donors in non-answers to my questions '			1
@entity61 , one of 14 conservative mps who rebelled last night over a @entity51 amendment enabling the courts to impose exemplary damages on newspapers which do not sign up to the new regulator , said it was ' laughable ' for @entity2 to pose as champions of a free press			2
' you are not here to represent a free press			0
you 're here to represent people who on the one hand court publicity for all it 's worth if there 's a financial return for them but do n't like the negative publicity that sometimes goes with it , ' he said			0
' you 're here representing the @entity86 of the world			0
you are not here representing the free press of the world			0
' claims : ( @entity93 to right ) presenter @entity36 , hairdresser @entity35 , billionaire @entity30 donor lord @entity91 and philosopher @entity33 have all allegedly donated to hacked off			1
mr @entity36 has denied it			1
after pressure from campaigners all political parties must declare donations of more than £ 5,000 , but hacked off appears unwilling to do the same			0
the group later hit back saying that newspapers should stop lobbying ministers over the creation of a new press regulator			2
@entity105 , a leading member of the group which campaigns for tighter press regulation , said the newspapers had had the chance to make their case to the @entity112 inquiry and should now accept its findings			2
anger : mps called on @entity2 to reveal who was donating to them on the offensive : @entity118 , executive director of @entity2 , told @entity115 today that papers were abusing their power speaking to @entity115 today hacked off director @entity118 accused some newspapers of an ' abuse ' of their power in an attempt to protect their own position			1
mr @entity127 , who was one of four hacked off representatives present at the late night talks where the deal was hammered out , said newspapers were not entitled to a fresh chance to influence ministers			0
' we do n't think they are entitled to lobby , ' he said			0
' there was a public inquiry where they were represented by a total of eight or 10 different qcs who argued their case , they have brought their evidence , the judge considered it , the judge came to his conclusion			0
' we think that the press should n't have a second bite of the cherry trying to lobby ministers again with arguments that failed in front of the public inquiry			0
we continue to think that those recommendations ought to be implemented			0

@entity115 call on the group to reveal who is funding them - but they are resisting
names of alleged donors are published although some deny *involvement*
those named include @entity36 , lord @entity166 and @entity33
