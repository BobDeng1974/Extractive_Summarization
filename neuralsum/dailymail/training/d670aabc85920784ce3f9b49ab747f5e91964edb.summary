by @entity0 published : 03:44 est , 11 july 2012 updated : 10:12 est , 11 july 2012 @entity2 's washout summer has been blamed on melting @entity4 sea ice , as forecasters warned that the torrential downpours and thunder would continue for the rest of the month			1
the soggiest june since records began has been followed by an equally miserable july , as parts of the @entity2 experienced the average rainfall for the month in just 10 days			2
@entity12 said that layers of melting sea ice across the @entity4 are partly to blame for the relentless rain , as they 've pushed cold plumes of air much further south than usual for this time of year			1
making a splash : a pair of ice cream vans struggle to drive through the flooded streets of @entity22 , @entity23 , as the north took a battering from the wet weather rescue : in the south west , the village of @entity29 , @entity30 , was the latest to find itself partly underwater today as the rain showed no sign of stopping @entity34 for heights : a villager in @entity29 is forced from their home via an upstairs window due to high water , as the @entity30 village suffered from this weeks deluge all hands to the pump : emergency crews took drastic measures to pump out the 3ft of water which had submerged @entity29 today making the best of it : workers at the @entity51 seemed in good spirits yesterday despite the relentless downpours the @entity4 sea ice began melting at a rapid rate in line with the @entity2 's run of dismal summers , leading many to question the effect of climate change on long - term weather patterns			1
despite the woeful conditions nationwide , however , many @entity2 soldiered on through the floods and showed admirable battling spirit			2
in @entity29 , @entity30 , two ice cream vans were spotted ploughing merrily through flood waters despite the small village being devastated by 3ft - deep swatches of floodwater			2
the claims from academics came as the @entity72 today gave a bleak outlook for the rest of the month , as more unsettled weather it predicted			2
no go : fire crews arrive on the scene in @entity29 today to pump out the huge volumes of water in the village overflowing : flood water laps up against a house in @entity29 , one of the areas in the south west worst affected by the deluge a spokesperson said that until the end of july there will be mostly unsettle patches of rainfall , interspersed only occasionally with sunshine			2
weather experts said up to 15mm of rain could fall in an hour in some places as the period of unseasonably wet weather that has brought flooding up and down the country continues			1
the @entity100 ( @entity100 ) today has five flood warnings in place - three in the @entity102 and two in the @entity103 - and 26 flood alerts in place across @entity106			1
do not cross : the @entity107 , a local pub in @entity29 , remained almost inaccessible today due to the surrounding 3ft of water powering through : young people in @entity29 have done their best to get through the deep swatches of water in their village , as this pair demonstrate what a difference two years makes : the @entity115 in @entity116 , @entity117 , looked parched a dry in july 2010 , in contrast to its brimming condition yesterday rut : our weather is stuck because the jet stream is further south than it should be at this time of year - over @entity125 and @entity126 , meaning @entity2 is under a blanket of low pressure on the northern side of it going under : two school children stand waist deep in flood water in @entity22 earlier this week , as forecasters warned the downpours will continue @entity136 effort : the crowds gathered and so did the clouds at @entity139 yesterday as the @entity140 was carried through an almighty downpour bleak : forecasters have predicted that as well as widespread rain today , wet weather will last beyond friday @entity146 2012 bosses making contingency plans for the wet weather have ordered 250,000 ponchos to hand out to spectators during the @entity150			1
@entity136 organisers made the move to battle the effects of downpours and thunderstorms on fans and athletes later this month			0
several of the events , including volleyball at @entity160 and eventing at @entity162 , are in temporary venues completely exposed to the elements			0
the @entity165 , meanwhile , is only two - thirds covered by a roof			0
even those who paid top prices for the best seats in the house could find themselves getting a soaking if the heavens open during the opening ceremony or during events			0

a @entity180 spokesperson told @entity181 : ' people in the @entity2 are used to watching sport in good and bad weather			1
' @entity186 weather clothing will be available for spectators to buy if they come unprepared			2
' the @entity72 today joined university academics in citing melting sea ice as a possible factor affecting @entity2 's weather			1
@entity192 , @entity72 spokesperson , said that although they are mainly attributing the rain to ' natural variability ' , sea ice being at record low levels for this time of year was also affecting weather patterns			1
jet streams of fast - moving wind have also been blamed for the constant downpours , causing the blankets of low pressure which lead to rain			1
@entity205 , forecaster at @entity206 , said earlier this week : ' our weather is really stuck in a rut because the jet stream is further south than it should be at this time of the year – over @entity125 and northern @entity126 – and we are under a blanket of low pressure on the northern side of it			1
mr @entity205 said that heavy rain will also sweep through the @entity2 from the south west on thursday			1
large parts of the region were already battling horrendous conditions , including the residents of @entity29 , where 3ft of water submerged the centre of the small @entity30 village			0
further north , places like @entity22 in @entity23 , which has already been pounded by relentless flooding , continue to struggle under the deluge of water			2
while the @entity72 has issued an amber warning of rain for south - eastern areas of @entity231 and yellow warnings across large swathes of southern and northern @entity106			1
a spokesman said : ' the public should be prepared for the likelihood of localised flooding , particularly in the amber area			1
' @entity239 , a forecaster with @entity206 , warned that bursts of torrential rain could fall on already saturated ground , increasing the chances of flooding			2
she said : ' @entity231 and northern @entity106 will see spells of heavy , persistent rain today and there are indications that there could be some torrential , thundery outbreaks			1
' elsewhere there will be showers , which could be persistent and heavy in some areas especially across southern and easterly parts of @entity106			1
' forecasters predicted rainfall totals of around 20 - 30mm , but said double that amount could fall in local areas			0
ms @entity239 said a further band of heavy , persistent rain will move in from the @entity102 during tomorrow , increasing the flooding threat			1
more showers are expected in @entity106 and @entity264 on friday			2
' the rain is falling on already saturated ground and river catchments are already at very high levels so further problems are to be expected , ' she added			2
sunday could provide some respite from the rain with drier spells forecast			0
showers hit most parts of the @entity2 yesterday , causing problems to the transport network and public events , including the @entity106 cricket match in @entity279			1
the @entity280 in @entity281 , which was shut due to flooding , remained closed in both directions between the @entity284 and @entity285 this morning			0
one of the country 's largest agricultural shows was also cancelled after just a day because of the appalling weather			0
the annual @entity289 in @entity290 began yesterday and was due to run until tomorrow but organisers decided to pull the plug last night			0
not stopping : residents of @entity22 have not seen the back of the wet weather yet after the downpours continued this week more on the way : heavy rain continued to fall on an already sodden @entity22 yesterday @entity2 winemakers are bracing themselves for a poor crop as the washout summer has decimated flowering vines			1
@entity303 was faced with 141mm of rain during the wettest june on record and winemakers are concerned for this year 's harvest			2
@entity308 flower before turning into fruit , which ripens before being harvested in october			0
but this year 's flowering season has been delayed due to heavy rain , and the @entity72 is forecasting continued bad weather next week during a crucial period for winemaking			1
@entity314 , who runs @entity315 in @entity316 , @entity317 , said : ' if it rains a lot during this period we end up with a poor fruit			0
' the flowers will just not turn to fruit			0
some varieties are more prone than others but it means the yield will be much reduced - the total could be just a tenth of what it could be in a good year			0
' you have a decreased quantity to sell and it does cause problems with cash flow			0
' @entity336 has run @entity337 near @entity338 , @entity317 , for 38 years			0
he said : ' i 've had at least 34 cropping years and it would be foolish to deny this will not be one of the more difficult ones			0
' i am nervous for the wellbeing of the national crop			0
this year is unlikely to produce a yield equal to previous ones			0
in 2011 a hard winter , mild spring and late heatwave helped to produce three million bottles of @entity106 wine but next year 's vintage is expected to be substantially lower			1
@entity355 spokesman for @entity356 said : ' for the next ten days or so wine producers will have to keep an eye out			0
' it 's still early days and there wo n't be too many people willing to make a call on what will happen just yet			0

five flood warnings still in place across @entity2 , along with 26 flood alerts
experts warn that melting @entity4 sea ice has sent plumes of cold air south , causing *extreme* weather in northern *hemisphere*
jet stream is further south than it should be for this time of year meaning @entity2 is under a blanket of low pressure
@entity380 should be prepared for ' localised flooding ' experts warn
heavy persistent rain and thundery outbreaks expected across @entity231 and northern @entity106
