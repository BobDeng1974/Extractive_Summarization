by @entity0 understanding a killer : @entity2 was the suspected assassin but he was killed by nightclub owner @entity3 before he could ever be put on trial a young journalist had the run - in of his career on the day of president @entity9 's assassination but he did n't even know it			1
@entity10 was a rookie reporter when he accidentally ran into @entity2 in the moments immediately after president @entity9 was shot			1
' he did n't appear stressed in any way , ' @entity10 said of @entity2			1

and they were literally hanging out of the window and looking up and pointing up , ' @entity10 told @entity25			2
' i thought , " i need to get to a phone and call			0
" so i ran down the sidewalk and up the steps and into the doorway of the depository building			2
' as soon as he got into the building , he realized that he needed help finding a phone in the building so he could file the report			2
' there was a guy standing in the doorway , and i said , " where 's the phone ? " and he jerked his thumb and said , " in there ! " and i said , " thank you , " â € ™ he told @entity25			0
the moment was so fleeting that even though @entity2 's picture was splashed across the papers and television news programs in the coming days , @entity10 did not realize that @entity2 was the man he spoke to until three weeks later			1
