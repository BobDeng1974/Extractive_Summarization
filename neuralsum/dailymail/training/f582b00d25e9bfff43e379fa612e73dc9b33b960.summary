by @entity0 published : 07:18 est , 18 january 2013 updated : 10:03 est , 18 january 2013 is this photographer faster than his own shadow ? these startling pictures taken by @entity4 certainly seem to show just that , as the @entity7 - artist has produced a series of thought - provoking photos of his own shadow just wearing trainers			1
@entity11 , who is the creative and art director of advertising firm @entity14 , is believed to have created the images through @entity16 , leaving audiences perplexed			0
shadow of his former self : @entity7 photographer @entity4 said a couple of experiences left him unsure of himself to the point he did n't recognise himself in photos abstract : @entity25 who lives and works in @entity14 said he photographed his shadow but decided to leave the shoes as a small reminder that there was at least some fragment of his personality left behind shadow work : the artist said : ' i do n't recognize myself any more			1
these photos express this feeling			0
these pictures are the way i see myself now he said the series came from changes in his life that left him unsure of who he was			0
he decided to leave the shoes as a small reminder that there was at least some fragment of his personality left behind so that he was more than just a shadow			1
@entity4 said : ' i do n’t recognize myself any more			1

these pictures are the way i see myself now			0
' my shadow is there but i erase myself because i do n't know who i am any longer			1
' the shoes remain only to make sure there is something more than a shadow			1
' man behind the shadow : @entity25 as seen on his @entity67 page ' i ’m not there ' is an ongoing series of portraits by @entity4 who divides his time between his work at the @entity14 advertising agency and photography			1
@entity76 does n't explain the nature of the experiences that forced him to question his own identity , but he wrote a few lines that accompany the images , in which he says : i am changing at this very moment of my life			0
i do not react in the same ways i used to			0
these pictures are the way i see myself now			0
' neither does he say whether his choice to leave shoes rather than any other item of clothing was a conscious one			1
shoes , according to psychologists reveal much about the wearer 's personality			2
last year psychologists from the @entity101 found that the style , value , colour and condition of the footwear can paint a picture of the owner 's emotional , political and other vital personality traits			0
63 students from the university looked at photographs showing 208 different pairs of shoes belonging to volunteers in the experiment			1
they were asked to look at each pair and guess the gender , age and social status of the owner , researchers reported to the @entity123			0
this including whether the owner was an extrovert or introvert , liberal leaning or conservative , their emotional stability , agreeableness , conscientiousness and openness			0
the team reported : ' shoes convey a thin but useful slice of information about their wearers			2
' shoes serve a practical purpose , and also serve as nonverbal cues with symbolic messages			2
people tend to pay attention to the shoes they and others wear			2
' shoes have great variety of styles , brands , looks , and functions			2
because of this variety , shoes can carry individual difference information , but do they ? ' we suggest that the answer is yes			2
' shadow on the court : @entity25 ' shadow and flip flops can be seen here on the tennis court identity crisis : @entity25 says that we are all constantly changing and this is the only honest , recognisable way of capturing who he really is searching in the shadows : @entity25 does n't go into detail about the experiences that forced him to question his identity but is clearly fascinated with exploring the constant transition of the self			1
