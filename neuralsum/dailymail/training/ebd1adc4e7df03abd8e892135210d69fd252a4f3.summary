when @entity1 left @entity2 in january some of the players took to social media to express their disappointment			1
the departure of some of those players seemed inevitable			0
similarly , @entity8 ’s exit was a certainty and sure enough that happened			0
saints have been a success story since @entity13 left them at the wrong end of @entity16 just over four years ago			0
so for a well - loved chief executive , a manager , and so many good players to leave the club in the space of a few months constituted a meltdown			2
my main philosophy in life has been applied by @entity26			0
it ’s not the setbacks that are important – it ’s how you respond to them			0
@entity31 ( centre ) is congratulated by his @entity2 team - mates after scoring against @entity34 @entity2 manager @entity35 ( second left ) watches his side beat @entity34 1 - 0 at the @entity37 and the response at @entity39 has been brilliant			1
they paid a huge amount for @entity42 , but he has set about the task of proving himself in the @entity45 superbly			0
money spent on @entity47 and @entity48 reflects well on the club ’s scouting system , the appointment of @entity35 is n’t the cheap anonymous option some clubs take , and there is still a commitment to youth – academy product @entity57 has featured in every game this season , while fellow youngsters @entity61 and @entity63 were on the bench on saturday			1
quietly , with zero spotlight on her , @entity2 owner @entity65 has gone about the business of continuing her late father ’s commitment to the club			1
@entity2 owner @entity65 has the final say on everything that happens at the club @entity34 goalkeeper @entity74 can only look on as @entity31 scores to put @entity2 ahead @entity2 's @entity76 celebrates with @entity31 after the final whistle on saturday the @entity2 website states that she is the ultimate controlling party of @entity80 in other words ms @entity65 has the final say on everything that happens at the club			1
she has sailed them through the choppy waters of massive change and led them out the other side			1
so far so good for @entity2 , let ’s see how the season works out			2
in an era of egomaniacs buying football clubs , picking teams for managers , and earning a fortune out of our clubs , @entity65 deserves a huge amount of credit			2
she ’s not only preserving the legacy of her father , she is making a lot of @entity2 fans very happy			2
not bad for a lady who reportedly does n’t have a great passion for football .			0

the response at @entity39 's to the *summer* 's *outgoings* has been brilliant
the appointment of @entity35 as manager is not the cheap anonymous appointment that some clubs take
@entity118 has sailed the @entity2 through the choppy waters of massive change
