@entity0 has confirmed that @entity1 will be his next opponent and the unified heavyweight champion says he is ready to travel to @entity3 to defend his belts			1
the @entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8 king ended his seven - year @entity10 hiatus by clearly out - pointing @entity11 at @entity12 on saturday night but it was not the dazzling @entity15 display he had promised on his stateside return			1
the @entity10 boxing public fell out of love with the 6ft6in @entity20 back in 2008 when he outpointed @entity22 @entity21 in an uninspiring , lop - sided victory in this very @entity12 ring			1
and , although seven years and 12 fights have passed since then for @entity0 , it was a case of same ring , same story			2
the watching @entity1 , who is mandatory challenger to the champion 's @entity8 belt and in line for a summer showdown , will have been encouraged by the performance			1
@entity0 celebrates after beating @entity11 on saturday night in @entity15 @entity0 was awarded a unanimous victory over @entity11 by the judges at @entity12 the fight against @entity11 was @entity0 's first in the @entity10 since he fought @entity21 in 2008 @entity0 has confirmed that @entity1 will be his next opponents and is willing to fight him in @entity3 but @entity0 has warned @entity1 that he will relish finally fighting a man taller than him , after his victory over 6ft3in @entity11			1
he said : ' i look forward to this fight , i think it will be challenging and exciting because i like to fight big men			0
it is much easier to fight bigger men than smaller			0
' i believe that the fight with @entity1 will look different to this one because of the size difference – fury is taller than me			2
he is definitely the guy who is ambitious and i think it is going to be exciting			0
i think that he is going to engage in the fight			0
' there was not much engagement through @entity11 today but i think the @entity1 fight will be exciting and i 'm looking forward to it			1
' the @entity20 once again used his height and longer reach to dominate has challenger @entity0 won 116 - 111 on two of the judges cards and by a margin of 118 - 109 on the other on saturday @entity0 was happy to travel to @entity10 to face an @entity10 – and insists he is ready to hit the road again to face the @entity64 born @entity1			1
the only confusion appears to be from which governing body the mandatory challenge will come			0
fury is @entity69 for the @entity8 strap but @entity0 's manager @entity71 says the order will actually come from the @entity7			1
either way , all three of the champion 's belts are likely to be on the line			2
' we still have to find out when and where the fight will happen but we will sort it out in the next few weeks , ' @entity0 added			2
' i am absolutely open to fighting anywhere			0
it depends on negotiations and hopefully we will not need a purse bid			0
' victory in @entity87 on saturday took @entity0 's run of consecutive title defences to 18 and a win against @entity1 will move him level with @entity91 on 19			1
he remains some way off the record of 25 set by @entity94 during the 1930s and 40s			0
he did , however , equal the @entity97 's total of 27 world heavyweight title fights contested at the @entity12			1
the 39 - year - old @entity20 saw off his @entity100 challenger on points at @entity12 brother @entity102 watches on as the world heavyweight champion celebrates his victory in @entity10 the 39 - year - old wears his @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity6 world heavyweight titles with pride after his win there is no doubting that @entity0 is one of the most dominant champions of any era but it could be argued that there has been a paucity of genuine challengers during his reign			1
the 30 - year - old , a former handyman in the @entity120 bank , only started boxing six years ago and this was only his 20th professional fight			0
indeed , when @entity11 first laced them up , @entity0 was already seven defences into his current hot streak			1
but he put up a good fight here , although on the few occasions he did get inside @entity0 's defence , he was unable to land anything other than single shots			0
despite standing three inches shorter than the champion , @entity11 enjoyed an incredible three - inch reach advantage , although it was not really a factor in the end			1
the @entity10 struggled to administer his jab and instead relied upon occasional forward raids			0
@entity0 , as ever , allowed him to move towards him and tied him up			0
the @entity20 is often criticised for his persistent holding and he was deducted a point for that in the 10th round here			0
@entity143 was in the crowd at @entity12 to watch her fiancee 's latest fight @entity12 , which has hosted some big fights over the years , pictured on saturday night @entity149 's last fight in the @entity10 was in @entity12 in 2008 , seven years ago despite that , he was awarded the win by a 116 - 111 on two cards and an ever bigger 118 - 109 on the other			1
however , the wide cards belie a unusual vulnerability about @entity0 at times , which was not in keeping with his most recent victories during which his defence has seemed virtually impregnable			0
the @entity0 brothers have been ruffled by @entity160 in the past with @entity162 infuriating them by wearing a t - shirt depicting him holding the severed heads of the brothers in each hand			2
then , before @entity169 fought older brother @entity102 , ' @entity168 boy ' slapped the champion at the weigh - in then spat water in @entity0 's face			2
@entity1 , one of @entity177 boxing 's biggest characters , is known for being outspoken and could attempt to get under @entity0 's skin			2
however , the 39 - year - old said : ' antics outside of the ring ? you know what , who cares about outside of the ring ? it 's all about what happens inside			0

@entity0 *successfully* defends his @entity7 , @entity6 and @entity8 belts
