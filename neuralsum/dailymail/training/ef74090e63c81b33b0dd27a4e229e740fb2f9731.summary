it is a mystery almost as great as those that he solves			0
but it seems the inspiration behind @entity6 may have been unveiled as a policeman from @entity8			1
little - known gendarme @entity9 is the man who the author turned into her famous detective @entity11 , according to records unveiled by historians			1
uncanny : gendarme @entity9 , left , who historians believe was the inspiration for @entity6 's fictional @entity8 detective , @entity11 , right @entity6 introduced the sleuth in her 1920 novel , @entity19 , and he went on to ' exercise his little grey cells ' in 33 novels			1
although the author never revealed any particular person as her inspiration , evidence has now been uncovered by both @entity8 archivists and the descendant of a wartime fundraiser which shows @entity9 could have been the real - life @entity6			1
@entity6 , pictured , first introduced the detective in her 1920 novel , @entity19			1
he went on to appear in 33 novels new details emerged of a meeting between a young @entity9 and @entity6 - when she played the piano for him in her home town of @entity35 , @entity36 , aged 24			1
@entity9 fled his country in the face of advancing @entity40 troops in 1914 and made his way to @entity42 - just as the fictional character did			1
the 57 - year - old and his son @entity44 , 17 , then travelled to @entity46 , @entity36 , to meet a local volunteer called @entity48 , who logged their names in her diary			0
mrs @entity48 , a married mother - of - four , helped around 500 @entity8 find places to stay during the @entity53 and was later honoured by its government			0
she was also involved in wartime fundraising events , hosting one at the home of a friend , a @entity59 , who was putting up @entity9 and his son at her house in @entity35			1
newspaper records reveal that locals laid on entertainment on january 6 , 1915 , with @entity6 playing the piano for the @entity8 guests			1
@entity6 later claimed she ' found ' the characters for @entity19 while travelling around @entity35			1
but @entity69 ’s grandson @entity68 was researching his relative ’s exploits with the help of the @entity73 when he uncovered a chance meeting between a man called ' @entity76 ' and @entity6			1
mr @entity77 , a retired navy captain , said : ' @entity78 kept a black notebook listing some 500 @entity8 refugees of all classes who passed through @entity46			0
' the first lot included this retired gendarme , @entity76 , and his son			0
the names of many of the families who received them are recorded			0
' ' @entity76 ' - now revealed as @entity9 - fled his country in the face of advancing @entity40 troops in 1914 , and made his way to @entity42 , just as the fictional character did			2
the 57 - year - old and his son @entity44 , 17 , travelled to @entity46 , @entity36 , to meet local volunteer called @entity48 , who logged their names in her diary after the discovery , @entity99 , an archivist at the local council in @entity101 , @entity8 , looked into it further			0
she said there was no - one known as ' @entity105 ' in the archives but she did discover a man by the name of @entity9 - who she said was likely to be the person in the entry			1
she said : ' we worked out the street name , rue @entity114 , even though the postcode has long changed			0
' then we found a @entity9 and his son @entity116			2
he must almost certainly be the man in the entry			0
' mr @entity77 said he had done a lot of research into what happened to the man who had met his grandmother			0
he said : ' he eventually went to stay with a @entity59 who lived in a house called the @entity125 in @entity35			2
it ’s been knocked down now and there ’s a housing estate in its place			0
@entity6 introduced the sleuth in her 1920 novel , @entity19 , and he went on to ' exercise his little grey cells ' in 33 novels according to her official website , @entity6 never revealed who inspired the character which in turn became a tv hit - but ' during the @entity53 there were @entity8 refugees in most parts of the @entity42 countryside , @entity35 being no exception ' ' but the @entity35 museum has confirmed however that the @entity145 held a meeting in their house to raise money and gather clothing for the refugees			1
' a young girl played the piano at the event			1
this young lady later became the crime writer @entity6 - so there is a very strong circumstantial link to @entity6			1
' mrs @entity48 , who was married to @entity77 , a solicitor and sheriff of @entity46 , died in the 1920s just as @entity6 ’s writing career was taking off			2
for her services to the refugees mrs @entity48 was awarded a @entity8 medal , la @entity165 , which the family still have			0
mrs @entity48 , a married mother - of - four , helped around 500 @entity8 find places to stay during the @entity53 and was later honoured by its government the youngest of the refugees are said to have nicknamed her @entity172 , pronounced @entity173 , which is @entity175 for @entity176			0
mr @entity77 said his grandmother had personally gone to the train station to meet all 500 , including @entity9 and his son @entity44 , in person			2
@entity9 would have been a similar age to his fictional counterpart , although little else is known about him and there is no mention of whether he had a moustache like @entity6			1
mr @entity77 said : ' all of us now think of @entity11 as rather a fat chap waddling along with a distinct character but that does n’t mean to say he was like that in real life			0
' all we know about this man is that he was gendarme and he had a son			0
he was married but he did n’t bring along his wife his wife at the time			0
' it ’s seems quite plausible that @entity6 met him at the event and may have been intrigued by his stories			2
' we do n’t know any of this for sure , but then its seems quite fitting that the real life @entity6 should remains as mysterious as the books themselves			2
' according to her official website , @entity6 never revealed who inspired the character - but ' during the @entity53 there were @entity8 refugees in most parts of the @entity42 countryside , @entity35 being no exception '			1
@entity215 , publisher for the @entity216 , said : ' @entity6 always claimed she was inspired by the @entity8 refugees she met			1
' it ’s quite plausible that she played the piano for them at a social event as she was quite an accomplished pianist			2
' as far as i ’m aware she never said that @entity6 was based on any one person , he ’s very much a composite character			2
' so whether this event was one of those occasions when she thought about him , i do n’t know - but it certainly makes for a great little story			0
' mr @entity9 was born in 1858 but left @entity8 as a refugee in 1914 with his son , who died in @entity231 aged 18			2
after the war , mr @entity9 returned to his wife and daughter , @entity235 , living in @entity101 until he died aged 86 in 1944			0
his daughter married but did not stay in @entity101 and archivists have yet to establish whether she had children .			0
