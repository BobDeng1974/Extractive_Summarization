by @entity0 published : 11:11 est , 13 march 2012 updated : 12:18 est , 13 march 2012 with its distinctive design reaching 180 feet into the air , the new @entity2 bridge in @entity3 is a pleasure to behold			1
yesterday , princess @entity7 arrived to officially open the £ 37m construction , which has been 40 years in the planning and gracefully splits in half to allow boats to pass through			1
there 's just one problem - no cars are allowed to use it			2
opening one : a huge crowd of people stand on the new £ 37million bridge on february 25 as the mayor of @entity21 opens the @entity2 bridge in @entity3 , @entity23 , to pedestrians emergency repairs : this large chunk of tarmac fell off the bridge when it was lifted up to allow a boat through in @entity3 , @entity23			1
it has now been shutdown so repairs can be carried out engineers spotted a large crack in the surface and a large two square metre chunk of the asphalt surface broke off while the bridge was last lifted up			1
although experts have examined the bridge , they have failed to ascertain exactly what is wrong			2
they may yet have to pull up all the @entity41 and relay it			1
but despite the problems , it has not stopped dignitaries repeatedly declaring the closed bridge ' open '			2
yesterday princess @entity7 was greeted by hundreds of well - wishers as she visited the site and pressed the operator ’s button to raise the two leaves			1
three days earlier the mayor of @entity21 staged a ceremonial lifting of the bridge to a @entity54 trumpet fanfare and the cheers of 2,000 people			0
before that on february 25 the mayor cut a ribbon to declare the bridge open to pedestrians			2
opening two : a crowd gathers on the bridge as mayor @entity21 stages the second official opening - lifting the bridge to allow boats through opening three : prince @entity7 holds a second lifting of the bridge as it is given its third official opening			1
although engineers had discovered faults the council said the event had to go ahead because ' you ca n't delay a royal visit ' officially open ? prince @entity7 is driven across the bridge - but it is now closed because of problems with the surface which will have to be re-laid , at least partially a spokesman for @entity81 confirmed there are no more opening ceremonies planned			1
the bridge in @entity3 has been planned for the last 40 years			1
it connects parts of the town centre with the district of @entity89			0
engineers are working to try and repair the bridge but they can not say how long it will remain closed to both cars and pedestrians			2
workers from contractors @entity95 found chunks of rubble , in pieces measuring up to one foot long on land beneath the bridge after it was lowered hours before princess @entity7 ’s visit			1
a 60ft by 21ft area of the road surface will be pulled up and inspected and then sections of it will be relaid			0
bridge of sighs : engineers have admitted they do not know exactly what the problem with the £ 37million bridge is - or when it can be reopened they do not yet know if one , two or all three layers of the asphalt will have to be relaid			1
@entity117 , strategic director at @entity81 , said : ' we have not fully understood the problem that we have got and are looking to the contractor and his specialists for advice			0
' we do know that it is a defect that has occurred and where there is a defect appropriate remedial action has to be determined			0
' relaying the quickdrying surface will take a couple of days			0
' it is a relatively small job to undertake once we understand what we need to do			0
' to say " it is going to open this week or in a week " would just not be possible			0
official opening : mayor @entity21 cuts the ribbon to declare the bridge open to pedestrians last month - but it has now had to close again ' @entity136 is a complex structure and our contractor has made a huge effort to complete the project on time			1
' a council spokesman said they could not have postponed any of the opening ceremonies as they had been booked well in advance			0
she said : ' you ca n’t delay a royal visit			0
' the event on march 9 was to commemorate 85 years of the old bridge as well as celebrate the new bridge and the ribbon cutting event was part of a community weekend that we held			0
' it is a construction programme and you ca n’t predict issues that can arise			0
' celebration : people gather on the bridge for the first opening ceremony last month - but it has now had to be shutdown again			2

princess @entity7 declares @entity2 bridge in @entity3 open but *motorists* are n't allowed to cross
chunk of asphalt fell off when bridge was last raised
engineers do n't know what is wrong - and may have to relay all the @entity41
