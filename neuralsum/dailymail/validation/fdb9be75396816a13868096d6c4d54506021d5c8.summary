@entity1 fans should hide behind the sofa rather than watch the @entity3 this summer , says @entity4			1
after a humiliating @entity6 exit , @entity1 face a @entity8 series in the @entity9 , followed by series at home to @entity12 and @entity13			1
speaking to @entity15 , the former @entity1 opener warned fans to expect an ‘ absolute hiding ’ and a ‘ horrendous six months ’			1
@entity4 , who played in 71 tests for @entity1 and scored eight centuries , added : ‘ when @entity13 come , just do n’t watch , hide behind the sofa			1
’ @entity1 's under siege captain and coach @entity21 ( left ) and @entity22 speak at the @entity23 former @entity1 opener @entity4 ( right ) has predicted the worst for the national team in the near future here @entity1 are preparing for a dead rubber against @entity28 , with @entity22 ’ men having far more to lose than just a meaningless group match			1
the indications are that @entity22 will keep his job , at least for the @entity33 in the @entity34 , whatever happens at the @entity23 tomorrow , but the last thing he needs is another desperate defeat by minnows			0
the fact @entity1 turned up early yesterday for what used to be known as naughty - boy nets and had a full training session said everything about their need to take something from their worst - ever @entity6			2
victory against @entity28 would perhaps give @entity22 breathing space before the squad is announced on tuesday for the three - @entity8 series in the @entity9 next month			0
@entity1 will be without @entity49 and @entity50 , two players who can still expect a one - day future , and it is far from certain that both will be able to take their places on the plane to @entity57 on april 2			0
@entity22 attempts to rally his troops on the @entity23 on wednesday ahead of their match against @entity28 @entity49 strained an abdominal muscle when bowling in the defeat by @entity62 while @entity63 has a ‘ stress reaction ’ in his left foot			1
it is to be hoped @entity1 give games to the two players yet to appear in this @entity6 : @entity69 and @entity70 , who could then be making their final odi appearances			2
after the @entity6 @entity1 must start from scratch with a one - day squad who will be at or near their peak in 2019			2
that means there is little point in persevering in 50 - over cricket beyond tomorrow with the likes of @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity82 , @entity83 or @entity84 , who said on wednesday he wants to play on			0
his is not a view shared by former @entity1 wicketkeeper @entity87			0
@entity1 quick @entity88 works up a sweat during a tough day of training in the @entity23 sunshine in his @entity93 column prior wrote : ‘ men like @entity82 , @entity84 and @entity83 ... remain key members of the @entity8 side , so perhaps it is time for them to concentrate solely on that form of the game , especially with an @entity3 summer approaching			1
’ there is a familiar figure at the helm of the @entity28 team in coach @entity105 , the former @entity106 batsman			0
he would have no qualms about piling on the misery for his homeland and said : ‘ we still believe we ’ve got a scare in us in this @entity6 , especially if we show composure at the top of the order			0
if we hold our nerve and are at our best we can pull off a shock			0

former @entity1 opener @entity4 told fans not to watch the ashes
he said prepare for ‘ an absolute hiding ’ and a ‘ horrendous six months ’
@entity1 face @entity28 in a @entity6 dead rubber in @entity23 on *friday*
