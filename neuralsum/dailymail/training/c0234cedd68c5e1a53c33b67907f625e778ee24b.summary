by @entity0 published : 12:37 est , 25 february 2013 updated : 08:46 est , 26 february 2013 the blockbuster @entity2 trial opened today with a scathing attack on the poor safety standards which led to the worst environmental disaster in @entity8 history			1
billions are at stake in the @entity12 courtroom where a federal judge is tasked with determining how much the @entity15 oil giant and its subcontractors should pay for the devastating blast and subsequent oil spill at the @entity20 rig in april 2010			1
@entity21 has said it already has racked up more than $ 24 billion in spill - related expenses and has estimated it will pay a total of $ 42 billion to fully resolve its liability for the disaster that killed 11 workers and spewed millions of gallons of oil into the @entity29			1
@entity21 is equally determined to avoid a finding of gross negligence , which would drastically increase its environmental fines to as much as $ 17 billion			1
the oil giant is also hoping to shift much of the blame -- and cost -- to rig operator @entity48 and subcontractor @entity50 , which was responsible for the runaway well 's faulty cement job			2
attorney @entity53 , who represents individuals and businesses hurt by the spill , said @entity21 executives applied ' huge financial pressure ' on its drilling managers to ' cut costs and rush the job ' before the blowout of its @entity63 well triggered the explosion that killed 11 workers and spawned the massive spill			1
the project was more than $ 50 million over budget and behind schedule at the time of the blowout , claimed @entity53			0
' @entity21 repeatedly chose speed over safety , ' said @entity53 , quoting from a report by an expert who may be called to testify later in the mammoth trial			2
activists protest in front of the @entity78 on the first day of the trial over the @entity20 oil rig spill in @entity12 , @entity35 today lawyers for @entity21 and the @entity82 are in court today for the opening day of a trial to determine liability in the 2010 deepwater horizon oil rig explosion and spill in the @entity29 fire boat response crews battle the blazing remnants of the offshore oil rig @entity20 , off @entity35 , in this april 21 , 2010 file image @entity8 district judge @entity93 said he would hear several hours of opening statements monday and the first witness would take the stand tuesday			1
unless a settlement is reached , the judge , not a jury , ultimately will decide months from now how much more money @entity21 and its partners on the ill - fated drilling project owe for their roles in the 2010 environmental catastrophe in the @entity29			1
@entity53 said the spill also resulted from rig owner @entity48 's ' woeful ' safety culture			0
he said the owner of the @entity20 rig failed to properly train its crew , calling it a ' chronic problem allowed by @entity48 management to go uncorrected			1
' ' the workforce was not always aware of the hazards they were exposed to , ' @entity53 said			0
' they do n't know what they do n't know			0
' @entity48 and @entity21 will make their case 's later on today in @entity12			1
oil can be seen in the @entity29 , more than 50 miles southeast of @entity124 on @entity35 's tip , as a large plume of smoke rises from fires on @entity21 's @entity20 offshore rig in april 2010 with billions of dollars on the line , the companies and their courtroom adversaries have spared no expense in preparing for a trial that could last several months			1
hundreds of attorneys have worked on the case , generating roughly 90 million pages of documents , logging nearly 9,000 docket entries and taking more than 300 depositions of witnesses who could testify at trial			0
' in terms of sheer dollar amounts and public attention , this is one of the most complex and massive disputes ever faced by the courts , ' said @entity150 law professor @entity149 , an expert in complex litigation			0
@entity93 has promised he wo n't let the case drag on for years as has the litigation over the 1989 @entity154 spill , which still has n't been completely resolved			0
he encouraged settlement talks that already have resolved billions of dollars in spill - related claims			2
' @entity157 has managed the case actively and moved it along toward trial pretty quickly , ' @entity149 said			0
in december , @entity93 gave final approval to a settlement between @entity21 and @entity162 ' @entity161 lawyers representing @entity165 businesses and residents who claim the spill cost them money			2
@entity21 estimates it will pay roughly $ 8.5 billion to resolve tens of thousands of these claims , but the deal does n't have a cap			1
@entity21 resolved a @entity82 criminal probe by agreeing to plead guilty to manslaughter and other charges and pay $ 4 billion in criminal penalties			1
@entity48 reached a separate settlement with the federal government , pleading guilty to a misdemeanor charge and agreeing to pay $ 1.4 billion in criminal and civil penalties			2
but there 's plenty left for the lawyers to argue about at trial , given that the federal government and @entity29 states have n't resolved civil claims against the company that could be worth more than $ 20 billion			1
one of the biggest questions facing @entity93 will be to determine if @entity21 was guilty of gross negligence			1
the @entity82 and private plaintiffs ' attorneys have said they would prove @entity21 did			2
a decomposed fish lies in the water as workers pick up oil balls from the @entity20 oil spill in @entity196 , @entity197 more than three months after the april 2010 disaster under the @entity200 , which is designed to punish companies and prevent future spills , a polluter pays a minimum of $ 1,100 per barrel of spilled oil ; the fines nearly quadruple for companies found guilty of grossly negligent behavior			1
@entity21 , meanwhile , argues the federal government 's estimate of how much oil spewed from the well — more than 200 million gallons — is inflated by at least 20 percent			2
@entity200 penalties are based on how many barrels of oil spilled			0
@entity93 plans to hold the trial in at least two phases and may issue partial rulings at the end of each			0
the first phase , which could last three months , is designed to determine what caused the blowout and assign percentages of blame to the companies involved			0
the second phase will address efforts to stop the flow of oil from the well and aims to determine how much crude spilled into the @entity29			0
the trial originally was scheduled to start a year ago , but @entity93 postponed it to allow @entity21 to wrap up its settlement with the @entity162 ' @entity161			2
a member of @entity35 gov. @entity236 's staff wearing a glove reaches into thick oil on the surface of the northern regions of @entity241 in @entity242 , @entity35 in june 2010 the deepwater horizon rig blew up 50 miles off @entity35 on april 20 , 2010 , in an explosion that investigators blamed on time - saving , cost - cutting decisions by @entity21 and its drilling partners in cementing the well shaft			1
following several failed attempts that introduced the @entity8 public to such industry terms as ' top kill ' and ' junk shot , ' @entity21 finally capped the well on the sea floor after more than 85 days			1
by then , the well had spewed an estimated 172 million gallons of crude into the @entity29 , fouling marshes and beaches , killing wildlife and closing vast areas to fishing			0
scientists warn that the spill 's full effect on the @entity29 food chain may not be known for years			0
but they have reported oil - coated coral reefs that were dying , and fish have been showing up in nets with lesions and illnesses that biologists fear could be oil - related			0
oil churned up by storms could be washing up for years			0
a series of government investigations has exhaustively documented the mistakes that led to the blowout , spreading the blame among the companies			0
@entity283 attorney general @entity282 said witnesses scheduled to testify at trial will reveal new information about the cause of the disaster			0
' i think you 're going to learn a lot , particularly about the culture that existed at @entity21 and their priorities , ' @entity282 said .			2

billions are at stake in the @entity12 courtroom in damages trial which began today
@entity8 *prosecutors* are determined to prove that gross negligence caused the april 20 , 2010 blast that killed 11 workers and sank the @entity21 - leased @entity20 rig
@entity21 is equally determined to avoid a finding of gross negligence , which would drastically increase its environmental fines to as much as $ 17 billion
