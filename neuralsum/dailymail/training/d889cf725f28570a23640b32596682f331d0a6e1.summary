the man next door had run out of fireworks by the time @entity3 scored their seventh goal			1
berliners have a habit of setting one off every time their team scores at a @entity9 , but there was n’t a shop in the city well stocked enough to provide for the @entity13			1
that is how the 7 - 1 victory over @entity16 on tuesday night is being referred to			1
' @entity13 ' was a phrase previously reserved for @entity3 ’s semi-final defeat to @entity19 in 1970 , which many consider to be the best football match ever			1
the 21st century , though , needed a game of its own			0
on tuesday night it got one			0
heroes : @entity3 smashed @entity16 7 - 1 in their @entity9 semi-final clash in @entity28 too good : @entity3 romped past @entity16 with a stunning display to produce a shocking result leader : @entity33 manager @entity32 was hailed as a national hero after his team 's 7 - 1 victory @entity3 were irresistible			1
before this game , they had been criticised for having abandoned the joyful football they played at the last @entity9			1
within one 18 - minute period in the first half , they answered their critics , silenced them , and had them dancing on their sofas			2
@entity32 , a man who has been attacked from every angle during this tournament , is suddenly a national hero once more			2
@entity47 was once bemoaned for his apparent laziness			1
but both are beyond criticism today , architects of a truly historic victory in @entity28			2
the @entity53 even referred to @entity47 as ‘ like @entity54 and @entity55 as one ’			1
video delight in @entity58 for @entity3 fans loud and proud : @entity3 fans at the @entity61 in @entity28 celebrate their team 's victory how many ? one @entity33 fan at a public viewing in @entity66 spells out the scoreline abroad : @entity33 fans in @entity69 watch their team annihilate @entity16 lining up : @entity3 now expects to lift the @entity9 at the @entity71 on sunday after this victory but it was not the performances of individual players for which this game will be remembered			1
it was the blistering collective display			0
it was the evening in which a team , which has disappointed so often in semi-finals , finally came into their own			2
it was for the team that the @entity33 media reserved their praise			2
@entity88 ’s headline simply said ‘ thank you ’ , and the paper went on to insist that ‘ no other team has earned the @entity9 title more than @entity3 in this tournament ’			1
the excitement ahead of the final is already at boiling point ; the atmosphere in @entity3 has changed overnight			1
on tuesday afternoon , there was cautious optimism that @entity3 might scrape their way to the finish line			1
on wednesday morning , the nation expects nothing less			2
@entity105 : the front page of @entity88 @entity107 : the @entity108 @entity109 : the @entity110 says thank you the players themselves were n’t getting carried away			0
@entity114 mischievously reminded reporters after the game that ‘ after games like the beloved @entity120 match , we get criticised , now you praise us into heaven ’			0
coach @entity32 was also quick to nail some feet to the ground , insisting that ‘ a bit of humility is good for us too			0
we do n’t want to be overhyped ’			0
not that the reaction is all based on clichéd @entity33 arrogance			0
many newspapers were even apologetic to the hosts			0
both the @entity131 and the @entity132 had the headline ‘ sorry ’ , with the latter describing @entity3 as ‘ the worst guests in history ’			1
largely , though , this is a day of celebration for @entity33 football			0
the @entity140 has called it ‘ @entity143 of @entity28 ’ , and many fans are as stunned as they are delighted			0
they had n’t expected this from @entity32 and his team			0
from the word go , almost the entire country had insisted that this team was chronically ill. tactical , psychological and physical symptoms were identified at every opportunity			0
the national team was supposedly a sick man			2
on tuesday night , the patient got out of its bed , threw on its clothes , and ran a marathon			0
it proved it was not sick at all , and it gave @entity3 one of the greatest nights of its footballing history			2
the country is in dreamland			0
