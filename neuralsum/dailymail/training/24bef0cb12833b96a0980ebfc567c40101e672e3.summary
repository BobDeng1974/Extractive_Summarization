the Â£ 269 ipad mini goes on sale tomorrow , but the site has already posted a look inside the gadget set to become the must - have this @entity19			1
analysts say the @entity42 - based @entity41 maker is trying to wean itself off its reliance on @entity32 , as both giants are embroiled in a bitter international legal battle over mobile patents , for everything from microchips to displays			1

it aims to help third parties find out how easy their new gadget are to repair , and each new gadget is given a ' repairability index '			2
in the ipad mini 's case , the index was low - meaning few parts can be repaired			1
however , the firm did find that the @entity32 manufactured screen can be easily repaired			2
' though the markings on the back of the @entity92 ( display ) do n't turn up much information , the @entity32 display driver @entity86 ( chip ) reveals that @entity10 , once again , went with @entity32 in its display manufacturing , ' @entity55 said , detailing the teardown on its website			2
however , @entity10 does sometimes uses more than one supplier			0
supplying parts for @entity10 's iphones and @entity100 - some of the industry 's most popular and advanced gadgets - is considered a coup for chipmakers and other manufacturers			0
the ipad mini also employs @entity108 flash memory , a @entity110 touch controller , and a number of microchips from @entity113 , according to @entity55 , which acquired one early			1
the 7.9 - inch ipad mini marks the @entity10 's first foray into the smaller - tablet segment			1
the company hopes to beat back incursions into its home territory - carved out with the original @entity72 's launch in 2010 - with 7 - inch slates that are popular with consumers , even as it safeguards its lead in a larger tablet space that even deep - pocketed rivals like @entity32 have found tough to penetrate			2
it has won mostly positive reviews focused on its ability to wrap most of the functions of its full - sized @entity72 sibling into a smaller package , but critics pointed out the higher price tag of the ipad mini and an inferior display relative to those of rival products like @entity139 's @entity138 and @entity141 's @entity140			1

friday 's global sales rollout may offer a hint of demand for the gadget , which analysts expect to be strong			0
@entity10 and @entity32 are engaged in patent disputes across several countries , and @entity10 is believed to be seeking ways to rely less on @entity32			0

@entity32 has stopped supplying displays for @entity10 's @entity41 , and plays a reduced role in the full - sized @entity72 , according to @entity165			2
@entity10 is also buying fewer memory chips from @entity32 for the @entity41 , relying more on @entity108 and @entity167			2
many analysts believe @entity10 will also gradually phase out @entity32 as the main producer of the mobile micro-processor and shift business to rival supplier @entity172			0
