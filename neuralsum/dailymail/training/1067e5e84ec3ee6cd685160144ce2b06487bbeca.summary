pictured is the eruption ash cloud of @entity25 , @entity26 in 2010 the study authors , from @entity28 and @entity29 , aimed to produce a plan that might help people survive an event on the scale of the eruption of the @entity36 volcano of @entity37 200 years ago			2
that eruption - the biggest in the last 10,000 years - resulted in a ' year without summers '			2
clouds of sulphuric gas blocked out the sun , cooling the temperature of the @entity44 for months on end			1
the @entity28 scientists , who worked with the @entity47 ( @entity48 ) , calculated that the climatic impact of a repeat could be controlled			0
producing huge quantities of a greenhouse gas called a hydrofluorocarbon , or @entity54 , would be sufficient to warm the atmosphere and balance the effect of the reduced temperature			1
the @entity54 would stop warmth leaving the planet , making up for the lack of solar heat reaching the atmosphere in the first place			1
the benefit of the plan is that @entity66 are already produced industrially , to create plastics , although their manufacture would have to increase 100-fold to achieve the required effect afforestation : this technique would irrigate deserts , such as those in @entity74 and @entity75 , to plant millions of trees that could absorb carbon dioxide			1
drawback : this vegetation would also draw in sunlight that the deserts currently reflect back into space , and so contribute to global warming			0
artificial ocean upwelling : engineers would use long pipes to pump cold , nutrient - rich water upward to cool ocean - surface waters			2
drawback : if this process ever stopped it could cause oceans to rebalance their heat levels and rapidly change the climate			1
@entity95 : this involves heaping lime into the ocean to chemically increase the absorption of carbon dioxide			0
drawback : study suggests it will have of little use in reducing global temperatures			0
@entity106 iron fertilisation : the method involves dumping iron into the oceans to improve the growth of photosynthetic organisms that can absorb carbon dioxide			0
drawback : studies suggest it will have of little use in reducing global temperatures			0
solar radiation management : this would reduce the amount of sunlight @entity44 receives , by shooting reflective sulphate - based aerosols into the atmosphere			1
drawback : carbon dioxide would still build up in the atmosphere			2
the proposal , published in the journal @entity130 , is the first significant geoengineering plan to avert disaster in the event of a volcanic eruption			2
hfcs are similar to @entity136 – destructive compounds which were banned in fridges and aerosol sprays in the 1980s			2
however , the specific type of @entity54 that the scientists propose using does not harm the ozone layer , unlike its chemical cousins , and disappears from the atmosphere after a few years , breaking down naturally			1
the benefit of the plan is that @entity66 are already produced industrially , to create plastics , although their manufacture would have to increase 100-fold to achieve the required effect			2
the researchers suggest a specific gas called @entity152 would be used , as it breaks down naturally after a few years , reducing the long - term effect			1
study author professor @entity154 , of the @entity28 , said : ' unlike global warming , the climate impacts from a volcano eruption have a natural end - point beyond which we would not need to act further			1
' however , the emissions of the short - lived gas we found to be needed are problematic in other respects			2
' while a gas could in principle be found that has few associated detrimental environmental impacts , we estimate that large quantities would be needed			1
this would be very expensive , and would require a vastly expanded industrial production capacity			0
' society would have to decide whether the risks associated with such a large volcanic eruption could ever justify this expense			0
' hfcs are similar to @entity136 – destructive compounds which were banned in fridges and aerosol sprays in the 1980s			0
however , the specific type of @entity54 that the scientists propose using does not harm the ozone layer , unlike its chemical cousins , and disappears from the atmosphere after a few years , breaking down naturally co-author dr @entity183 added : ' considering such drastic action may appear far - fetched			1
but it would be unwise for the scientific community and policymakers not to think the issue through			0
' @entity190 , large volcanic eruptions are inevitable			0
' ' however , to our knowledge , no one had considered whether similar ideas could be applied to temporary global cooling from volcanic eruptions			0
we investigated , and found that yes , in principle , they can			0
' the plan was welcomed by climate scientists yesterday			0
professor @entity200 of the @entity201 said : ' the possibility of deliberate intervention to ' engineer ' our climate is undoubtedly scary , but climate change causes problems for both people and ecosystems , especially if it is large and rapid , whether it is warming or cooling			0
' it is sensible and responsible to consider whether , and if so how , we could moderate such changes , and to think through the benefits , costs and risks of doing so , before we attempt to reach any decisions about whether or not such actions should ever be considered			0
' we need to be prepared , so far as possible , and explorations like this are desirable , even if some people find them distasteful			0
' dr @entity221 of the @entity222 added : ' it is an interesting idea , with an appropriate level of careful caveats , and probably worthy of further investigation , not least because it broadens the debate on climate engineering to countering natural , as opposed to anthropogenic threat			0
and professor @entity231 of the @entity232 said : ' this is an interesting left - field study suggesting that the cooling effects of a large volcano could be counteracted by deliberately injecting short - lived greenhouse gases into the atmosphere			1
