by @entity0 , education correspondent facing the most challenging and complex job market in living memory , teenagers are increasingly looking to their parents for guidance about their future careers it is the stage of life when they are looking to forge their own identity			1
but many of today ’s teenagers are looking no further than their parents for inspiration and guidance			1
they are more likely than the previous five generations to want the same career as their mother or father , study has found			0
a third expect to follow in their parents ’ footsteps – more than at any time over the last 100 years			1
it is thought that teenagers are increasingly seeking to make the most of family connections to kick - start their careers in an intensely competitive job market			0
but researchers also suggest that parents – particularly mothers – are more likely to have carved out careers for themselves that their children want to follow			2
the findings emerged in a study to chart the ‘ evolution of the teenager ’ over the past century			2
commissioned to mark the outbreak of the @entity40 , it paints a picture of dramatically changing attitudes to work , role models , family , ambition and obstacles to employment			1
today ’s teenagers emerged as the most driven generation in 100 years , as well the most entrepreneurial			1
they also valued education and qualifications more highly than previous generations , which tended to see character traits such as leadership as more important than schooling for finding work			0
but they face the most challenging and complex job market in living memory , with 92 per cent expecting to encounter barriers when looking for long - term employment			0
perhaps the study ’s most surprising ’ finding was that today ’s teenagers , known as ‘ generation citizen ’ , were the most likely to want a similar job to their parents , despite the variety of careers now available			1
a third said they expected to follow in parents ’ footsteps – twice as many as a century ago			1
dr @entity72 , from @entity73 , who helped compile the report , said : ‘ i think it relates to increasing levels of social mobility , with young people increasingly looking to within their own families for career inspiration , rather than to more traditional role models such as bosses and teachers			0
’ she said youngsters were also seeking work experience at their parents ’ place of work			0
parents nowadays may also have a better understanding of the job market			0
the research , commissioned by the @entity93 , a government - backed scheme to encourage community work among teenagers , questioned 3,600 @entity98 across six generations			1
the oldest group surveyed were 100 from the ‘ greatest generation ’ , the over- 90s			2
born around the time of the @entity40 , serving one ’s country and supporting one ’s family were for them more important than a career			2
the study , carried out at @entity73 , was commissioned to mark the outbreak of the @entity40			1
it found that priorities for people born 100 years ago were serving one ¿ s country and supporting one ¿ s family just 17 per cent followed in their parents ’ footsteps when choosing a livelihood			1
a further 500 were questioned from the ‘ silent generation ’ , those aged 72 to 89 , who were probably too young to fight in the @entity121 but as teenagers may have experienced its hardships			0
they were more likely to look to traditional role models such as teachers or bosses than parents			0
the researchers also questioned 1,000 ‘ baby boomers ’ , who are now aged 54 to 71 , 1,000 from ‘ @entity130 ’ , now aged 32 to 53 as well as 500 from ‘ generation y ’ , who are aged 19 to 32 and 500 from ‘ generation citizen ’ , or 13 to 19 - year - olds			0
‘ generation citizen ’ emerged as the most driven , declaring that career success was one of the most important things in life for them			2
only the ‘ silent generation ’ , who grew up in the @entity145 of the 1930s , showed similar aspiration .			0
