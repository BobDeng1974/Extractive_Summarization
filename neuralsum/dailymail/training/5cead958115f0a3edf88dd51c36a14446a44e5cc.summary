this was not how it was meant to be			0
the @entity2 , @entity3 and @entity4 attacking trident has started twice and @entity6 have been beaten on both occasions			1
although this defeat in the @entity10 by @entity11 could never be as painful as their collapse against @entity14 last weekend , it was more humiliating			1
@entity6 supporters have been waiting patiently to see @entity2 unleashed at the @entity10 , because of his biting suspension , and his availability was heralded as the start of a new era			1
but an almost supernatural performance by goalkeeper @entity21 , the woodwork and simply profligacy , meant that @entity24 was humbled by the side he managed last season			2
@entity4 is one goal away from equaling all - time top scorer in @entity30 's record but it seems to be weighing heavy on his shoulders			2
he could not strike at the @entity33 last week , missing a sitter , and nothing could beat @entity21 here			0
having thrashed @entity87 earlier in the day , @entity14 had leapfrogged @entity6 at the top of the @entity90 table , along with city rivals @entity91 , who had seen off @entity93			1
@entity6 manager @entity24 did an impressive job with @entity11 last season and @entity96 has continued his work , playing a similar style of pressing , aggressive football			1
the @entity6 coach knew this was n’t going to be an easy game and went for power in midfield , with @entity49 and @entity52 ahead of @entity105 , with @entity51 on the bench			2
@entity47 was restored to centre - back after his hapless performance on the left against @entity14 , while @entity110 , seen looking at his phone and clowning around during the @entity112 on wednesday , was not even included in the squad			1
@entity49 powered down the left early on , whipping the ball in for @entity3 , who should have done better than head straight into the arms of @entity21			0
just a couple of minutes later he made amends , with a dipping long range strike which swirled over the goalkeeper but hit the top of the crossbar			2
but @entity11 were n't planning on rolling over and having their bellies tickled			0
the @entity124 - @entity3 frontline were having teething difficulties			0
they looked more a collection of expensive parts than a functioning motor			0
this was exemplified when @entity2 , on the right , cut the ball back to the edge of the box , but nobody was waiting there			0
@entity11 began to cause problems of their own , with @entity70 , a former @entity6 player , firing over from a free kick			1
@entity139 headed at @entity44 from a corner too , when he should have tested the keeper			0
@entity2 sums up @entity6 's night as he kneels dejected on the @entity10 turf , covering his face with his hands @entity2 beats @entity70 down the right - hand side during @entity6 's @entity90 match with @entity11 @entity2 cuts a figure of frustration as he spreads his arms wide to berate a team - mate those two chances acted as smelling salt for @entity6 , who took the game by the scruff of the neck			1
@entity3 's cutback for @entity4 saw the @entity159 's flash shot tipped over by @entity21			0
just after half - an - hour @entity4 nearly struck , with his goal - bound shot hacked off the line , via the post , by @entity11 defender @entity164			1
@entity4 missed a third good chance with a free header from a @entity2 cross , looping it over the bar , while the provider was harshly penalised in a 50 - 50 wrestling match with @entity164			1
the @entity171 had a good chance to open his @entity6 account as half - time approached , but dragged his low strike from the left and @entity21 fielded it easily			2
an almost identical chance for @entity3 followed and he hit it low and hard , but his angled drive was tipped away by the @entity11 stopper			2
there may as well not have been a half - time break because @entity6 were back at it from the off			2
@entity4 ’s through - ball fed @entity185 down the left and he cut it back for @entity3 , who hit the crossbar for the second time in the match			1
@entity3 had scored 11 in 11 before the match , but could not get on the scoresheet @entity4 needs just two goals to beat the @entity90 goalscoring record , but not even he could beat @entity193 @entity2 ( left ) takes on @entity194 of @entity11 but then @entity11 struck , 10 minutes into the second half			1
a long goal kick by @entity21 saw @entity139 out - jump @entity46 , with @entity70 and @entity37 running onto it			2
@entity70 outmuscled @entity45 and backheeled the ball cutely into @entity37 ’s path			0
the forward had shaken off @entity105 and rolled the ball past @entity44			1
it was the first goal @entity6 had conceded at the @entity10 since the @entity204 header which saw @entity91 snatch the title out of their hands on the final day of last season			2
@entity24 acted , throwing on @entity51 for @entity208 , @entity53 for @entity52 and moving to three at the back with @entity46 in midfield			0
it almost paid dividends immediately , with @entity53 receiving the ball on the right and looking to find a team - mate in the box			0
when faced with @entity2 , @entity4 and @entity3 all screaming for it , who do you pick ? he opted for @entity2 and the striker should have scored , heading into the grateful @entity21 ’s hands			0
@entity4 beats @entity11 's @entity220 during a solo run , but he could not find the back of the net @entity6 head coach @entity24 looks dejected as he watches on from the sidelines the @entity6 wall jumps as @entity70 's free - kick flies towards @entity44 's goal @entity2 took a tumble on the edge of the box and @entity4 fired the free kick into the gods			1
perhaps this was just going to be one of those days			0
it certainly looked like it when he had another from the same position and pinged it off the crossbar – the third time @entity6 had hit the woodwork			1
at the other end @entity11 continued attacking on the counter and should have put the game beyond @entity6 ’s reach			1
@entity44 saved a @entity70 volley and substitute @entity69 headed the rebound over the bar with the goal gaping			0
@entity69 was foiled by @entity44 too , his flicked effort palmed over the bar			0
@entity11 keeper @entity21 , the clear man of the match , produced another brilliant stop to deny @entity2 with five minutes left on the clock			1
the striker teed himself up on the edge of the box , but his sweet strike was palmed behind			0
in time , @entity2 , @entity4 and @entity3 will work			0
but the day after @entity262 it turned out all the shocks had n’t been used up			0
@entity6 's strikers will be having nightmares about @entity21 for weeks			2
@entity4 fights for the ball with @entity11 's goalscorer @entity37 @entity6 defender @entity185 presses forward with the ball during the @entity90 match at the @entity10 @entity2 concentrates as makes his home debut for @entity6 after his summer move from @entity271 @entity45 grimaces as he battles for the ball with @entity11 striker @entity70 @entity4 competes with @entity37 during the first half of the match the @entity6 starting 11 line up for a pre-match squad photo , but they failed to regain their place at the top of @entity90 a stunning view of @entity6 's @entity10 during the build - up to the match			1

@entity14 's 0 - 4 win earlier in the day meant that @entity6 needed to win to regain their status as league *leaders*
@entity2 started for @entity6 , making his home debut after his first match against @entity14 last weekend
@entity6 hit the crossbar four times during the match , but were not able to score
@entity11 upset the odds when @entity37 *slotted* past @entity44 to put the away side 0 - 1 up
