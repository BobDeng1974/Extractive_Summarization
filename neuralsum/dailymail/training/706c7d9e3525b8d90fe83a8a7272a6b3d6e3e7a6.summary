after travelling 352 million miles in eight - and - a - half months , @entity1 's rover curiosity finally landed on @entity2 at 5.32 gmt this morning			1
the high - tech craft hit the top of the @entity2 atmosphere at 13,000mph , and was then slowly lowered by a radical floating ' sky crane ' before gently arriving in a massive crater			1
the news was greeted with cheers and shouts in @entity1 's @entity11 , and within seconds the craft had sent back the first pictures of its new home			1
here , the parachute is clearly visible			0
jubilant scientists hugged , wept and distributed @entity2 bars to each other as mission controllers confirmed the landing			1
' touchdown confirmed ' , controllers said			0
curiosity later sent back the first high resolution picture of its landing site , showing one of its wheels on the martian surface			1
colour images are expected later this week			0
' we are wheels down on @entity2			0
' the rover even has a @entity41 feed associated with it , announcing its arrival by saying : ' i 'm safely on the surface of @entity2			1
@entity44 i am in you ! ! ! ' @entity1 administrator @entity46 hailed the success as a big step towards sending men to the red planet			1
' today , the wheels of @entity29 have begun to blaze the trail for human footprints on @entity2 , ' he said			0
' we 're on @entity2 again , and it 's absolutely incredible			2
' it does n't get any better than this			0
' curiosity on the surface of mars : within seconds of landing , the rover sent back these images			1
in the left hand picture , the shadow of the rover can be clearly seen , while rocks on the surface can also be seen			1
the mission was hailed by president @entity68 , who said : ' tonight , on the planet @entity2 , the @entity69 made history			1
' the successful landing of @entity29 – the most sophisticated roving laboratory ever to land on another planet – marks an unprecedented feat of technology that will stand as a point of national pride far into the future			1
' it proves that even the longest of odds are no match for our unique blend of ingenuity and determination			0
' flight system manager @entity87 ( c ) and @entity88 flight director @entity89 ( 2nd @entity90 ) celebrate curiosity 's successful landing @entity1 's @entity94 mission control room erupts with cheers as scientists recieve the first images from the @entity29 mars rover the trickiest moment of the landing came in a truly out of this world gymnastics routine during @entity29 's ' seven minutes of terror ' plummet through the atmosphere			1
when the rover had safely navigated its landing and touched down on the face of the @entity2 , @entity1 scientists exploded with delight and some even broke down in tears , overwhelmed at the success of the decades - long project			1
the team are already busy analysing the first images from the rover			2
' @entity29 's landing site is beginning to come into focus , ' said @entity119 , project manager of @entity1 's @entity120 at the @entity121 in @entity94			1
' in the first hd image ( above ) we are looking to the northwest			0
' what you see on the horizon is the rim of @entity44			0
' in the foreground , you can see a gravel field			2
' the question is , where does this gravel come from ? it is the first of what will be many scientific questions to come from our new home on @entity2			2
' @entity29 's trajectory was so accurate that engineers decided to wave off a last chance to tweak its position before atmosphere entry			2
' we 're ready to head in , ' said mission manager @entity146			2
as part of a long - running tradition , flight controllers broke out the ' good luck ' peanuts before @entity29 took the plunge			0
curiosity 's new home : the @entity44 on @entity2 , where the rover landed			1
telecom engineer @entity156 hugs a colleague following the successful landing of @entity1 's @entity29 rover flight director @entity161 ( r ) celebrates with @entity162 ( @entity163 ) at the @entity164 ( @entity164 ) in @entity94 following the @entity160 's safe landing			1
high five : curiosity team member @entity167 , chief engineer , @entity169 , @entity170 , and control at @entity164 , left , celebrates with @entity172 , @entity120 entry , descent and landing ( @entity177 ) worker			2
one scientist who could relate to the building anxiety was @entity181 planetary scientist @entity180 , who headed @entity1 's last successful rover mission in 2004			1
this time around , @entity183 has a supporting role and viewed the landing with other researchers in the ' science bullpen			1
' ' landing on @entity2 is always a nerve - racking thing , ' he admitted			2
' you 're never going to get relaxed about something like landing a spacecraft on @entity2			2
' @entity193 ( front , c ) of @entity196 , celebrates while watching a live broadcast of the @entity198 in @entity199 sunday 's touchdown was especially intense because @entity1 is testing a brand new landing technique			1
due to the communication delay between @entity2 and @entity203 , @entity29 was on autopilot			0
there was also extra pressure because budget woes have forced @entity1 to rejig its @entity2 exploration roadmap			0
artist 's impression of @entity1 's @entity160 on the surface of @entity2 on average the red planet is 141.6 million miles from the @entity214 with a diameter of 4,222 miles , it ’s around half the size of the @entity203			1
it ’s absolutely freezing there , with an average temperature of @entity221 ( -65c )			0
gravity is much less powerful - slightly less than 40 per cent of ours			0
the atmosphere is desperately thin – one per cent of @entity203 ’s pressure – and not very nice for us humans because 95 per cent of it is carbon dioxide			0
it boasts the solar system ’s biggest mountain – @entity233 , a dead volcano			0
@entity2 ’s red colouring comes from the iron oxide that coats its surface			1
@entity2 has huge amounts of ice at its polar caps			0
if they melted , it would cover the whole planet in water 11 - metres deep , according to @entity1			2
' there 's nothing in the pipeline ' beyond the planned launch of a @entity2 orbiter in 2013 , said former @entity1 @entity2 czar @entity249 , who teaches at @entity250			2
@entity29 was launched to study whether the @entity2 environment ever had conditions suitable for microbial life			2
the last @entity2 rovers , twins @entity254 , were cocooned in air bags and bounced to a stop in 2004			0
the plans for @entity29 called for a series of braking tricks , similar to those used by the space shuttle , and a supersonic parachute to slow it down			0
next , it ditched the heat shield used for the fiery descent			0
and in a new twist , engineers came up with a way to lower the rover by cable from a hovering rocket - powered backpack			2
at touchdown , the cords cut and the rocket stage crashes a distance away			0
the nuclear - powered @entity29 , the size of a small car , is packed with scientific tools , cameras and a weather station			0
it sports a robotic arm with a power drill , a laser that can zap distant rocks , a chemistry lab to sniff for the chemical building blocks of life and a detector to measure dangerous radiation on the surface			1
it also tracked radiation levels during the journey to help @entity1 better understand the risks astronauts could face on a future manned trip			0
after several weeks of health checkups , the six - wheeled rover could take its first short drive and flex its robotic arm			0
curiosity mission managers , flight controllers , scientists and administrators speak at a press conference after the @entity308 successfully landed on the surface of the @entity2 the landing site near @entity2 ' equator was picked because there are signs of water everywhere , meeting one of the requirements for life as we know it			1
inside @entity44 is a three - mile - high mountain , and images from space show the base appears rich in minerals that formed in the presence of water			0
previous trips to @entity2 have uncovered ice near the @entity2 north pole and evidence that water once flowed when the planet was wetter and toastier unlike today 's harsh , frigid desert environment			1
@entity331 : the area known as @entity44 crater area where @entity1 's curiosity rover landed @entity29 's goal now is to scour for basic ingredients essential for life , including carbon , nitrogen , phosphorous , sulfur and oxygen			1
it 's not equipped to search for living or fossil micro-organisms			1
to get a definitive answer , a future mission needs to fly @entity2 rocks and soil back to @entity203 to be examined by powerful laboratories			1
the mission comes as @entity1 retools its @entity2 exploration strategy			0
spectators in @entity196 's @entity199 react as they watch the announcement of the @entity2 science rover curiosity , successfully landing thousands of spectators gathered in @entity196 's @entity199 to watch the mission on the big screen @entity357 , a space fan , watches in @entity196 's @entity199 faced with tough economic times , the space agency pulled out of partnership with the @entity362 to land a rock - collecting rover in 2018			1
the @entity364 have since teamed with the @entity365 as @entity1 decides on a new roadmap			0
despite @entity2 ' reputation as a spacecraft graveyard , humans continue their love affair with the planet , lobbing spacecraft in search of clues about its early history			2
out of more than three dozen attempts - flybys , orbiters and landings - by the @entity69 , @entity381 , @entity364 and @entity382 since the 1960s , more than half have ended disastrously			0
one @entity1 rover that defied expectations is opportunity , which is still busy wheeling around the rim of a crater in the @entity387 eight years later			0

rover weighing a ton landed at 5.32 gmt ( 1.32 edt )
*textbook* landing saw radical floating ' sky crane ' used for the first time
first pictures reveal *mystery* gravel on the martian surface
@entity401 will search for the ingredients of life on the red planet 's surface using a scoop to dig into the soil
