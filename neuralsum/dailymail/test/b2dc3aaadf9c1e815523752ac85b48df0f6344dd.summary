@entity6 manager @entity55 looks on as @entity1 watches the play unfold @entity1 was positioned in an advanced role for @entity6 , a position he admits he prefers playing @entity1 looks dejected as @entity6 were comfortably beaten by @entity7 in the @entity59 position : started up front where he likes it ( and not at wing - back where it seems he does n’t ) because @entity65 was only fit enough for the bench after the hip injury which ruled him out of @entity69 duty			1
