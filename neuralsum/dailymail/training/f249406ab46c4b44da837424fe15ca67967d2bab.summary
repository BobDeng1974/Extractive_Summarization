that would not only make it the biggest online shopping day of the year , but the biggest since @entity22 started tracking shoppers ' online buying habits in 2001			2
the strong start to @entity21 , a term coined in 2005 by a shopping trade group that noticed people were doing a lot of shopping on their work computers on the monday following @entity34 , comes after overall online sales rose significantly during the four - day holiday shopping weekend that began on @entity34			1
‘ online 's piece of the holiday pie is growing every day , and all the key dates are growing with it , ’ said @entity38 analyst @entity37			2

’ it 's the latest sign that @entity48 are becoming addicted to the convenience of the @entity44			2
with the growth in smartphones and tablet computers , shoppers can buy what they want , whenever they want , wherever they want			2
as a result , retailers have ramped up the deals they 're offering on their websites during the holiday shopping season , a time when stores can make up to 40 per cent of their annual revenue			2
cyber monday palace : workers pull merchandise as it arrives at the @entity17 fulfillment center @entity17 , which started its cyber monday deals at 12:01 a.m. monday , offered as much as 60 per cent off a @entity69 viera 55 - inch tv that 's usually priced higher than $ 1,000			1

how well retailers fare on @entity21 will offer insight into @entity48 ' evolving shopping habits during the holiday shopping season			0
careful placement : @entity143 places a completed order onto a conveyor belt prior to packaging with the growth in high speed internet access and the wide use of smartphones and tablets , people are relying less on their work computers to shop than they did when @entity154 , the digital division of trade group @entity156 , introduced the term ‘ cyber monday			1
’ as a result , the period between @entity34 and @entity21 has become busy for online shopping as well			0
indeed , online sales on @entity34 , traditionally not a popular day for online shopping , rose 32 per cent over last year to $ 633 million , according to @entity22			1

the @entity156 estimates that overall retail sales in november and december will be up 4.1 per cent this year to $ 586.1 billion			1
but as other days become popular for online shopping , cyber monday may lose some of its cache			1
to be sure , @entity21 has n't always been the biggest online shopping day			0
in fact , up until three years ago , that title was historically earned by the last day shoppers could order items with standard shipping rates and get them delivered before @entity185			0
that day changes every year , but usually falls in late december			0
even though @entity21 is expected to be the biggest online shopping day of the year , industry watchers say it could just be a matter of time before other days take that ranking			2
