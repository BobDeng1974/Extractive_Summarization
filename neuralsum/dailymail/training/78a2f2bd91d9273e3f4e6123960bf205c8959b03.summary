click here to see more from our brilliant @entity1 - including @entity4 's heat map it really does take a very good goalkeeper to eclipse @entity7 and @entity8 have that very man			1
@entity11 ’s @entity10 was voted the best stopper in @entity13 last season and last night he proved to the world precisely why , with a series of thrilling saves capped by heroics in the penalty shoot - out			1
backed by five nerveless spot - kicks from his team - mates , @entity10 ensured his tiny @entity23 nation will take part in their first ever @entity26 quarter - final , despite playing for nearly an hour with 10 men against @entity28			1
they responded to misery having been seconds from victory before @entity33 appeared unmarked to keep the @entity34 in the competition with a stoppage time goal which wiped out the opener scored by @entity4			1
@entity28 seemed sure to win from this point but @entity8 dug in , rode their luck it has to be said , relied on their magnificent goalkeeper and won it on penalties			1
@entity63 converted the next one and @entity8 were off , celebrating with what energy they had left			2
they have secured a date with @entity88 in @entity89 on friday , although it ’s hard to imagine the @entity91 are quaking in their clogs			0
the spirit of @entity95 ’s team is far higher than its quality and it will take some time to get over the draining emotion and the muscle sapping effects of 120 minutes in @entity101 ’s heat and humidity			0
they will also be without defender @entity104 in the quarter - final after his red card			1
tragedy : @entity33 ( c ) wheels away after scoring the equaliser in the dying minutes good timing : defender @entity33 chose the ideal moment to score his first goal for @entity28 head over heels : @entity33 ( bottom ) is congratulated for his last minute equaliser it 's going to be a long night ! @entity8 players stretch after the game is taken into extra-time @entity121 ( @entity8 ) - scores , 1 - @entity123 effort high down the @entity124 ( @entity28 ) - scores , 1 - @entity120 shot into bottom @entity125 ( @entity8 ) - scores , 2 - @entity126 an effort just under @entity128 ( @entity28 ) - scores , 2 - @entity130 spot - kick straight down the @entity131 ( @entity8 ) - scores , 3 - @entity132 his penalty high and @entity134 ( @entity28 ) - scores , 3 - @entity136 ball into top right @entity137 ( @entity8 ) - scores , 4 - 3rolled a shot bottom @entity139 ( @entity28 ) - misses , 4 - @entity141 saved brilliantly to his @entity142 ( @entity8 ) - scores , 5 - @entity143 winner into top left corner all this drama seemed highly unlikely at the end of an excruciatingly dull first - half when the crowd in @entity101 , which was far from capacity , made their feelings known by whistling and jeering the teams into the break			1
it had been 45 minutes devoid of incident but for an excellent save by @entity156 to thwart @entity157			0
in darted @entity157 from the right to connect with a splendid cross on the run by left - back @entity161 , but @entity10 spread his body and deflected the effort wide with his right leg			2
@entity166 planted a free header straight at the @entity8 ‘ keeper in the second - half before @entity28 went behind to the goal from @entity4 , which seemed like a miskick , seven minutes after the interval			1
it may have been that the talented @entity4 had simply applied incredible deception to his shot , shaping to curl it inside one post with his left foot while rolling it into the opposite corner of the net , after @entity182 ’s foraging on the left and a pass from @entity185			2
from here , the tie exploded			0
@entity8 were denied a penalty moments later when @entity189 clearly handled a right - wing cross heading towards @entity185			2
the officials missed it and substitute goalkeeper @entity192 was shown a yellow card for being the most vociferous of many complaining from the bench			0
cottage industry : @entity197 flop celebrates after opening the scoring for @entity8 i meant that ! @entity201 appeared to mistime his second - half effort before finding the back of the net get in ! @entity4 of @entity8 ( @entity205 ) celebrates with @entity206 before @entity8 were reduced to ten men @entity8 : @entity208 celebrates with his teammates after @entity8 breal the deadlock @entity8 3 - 4 - 2 - 1 : @entity156 8.5 ; @entity104 5 , @entity131 6 , @entity63 6 ; @entity211 6 ( @entity212 76 min , 6 ) , @entity206 6 ( @entity213 66 , 6 ) , @entity121 7 , @entity214 6.5 ; @entity4 6.5 , @entity185 7.5 ( @entity215 84 , 6 ) ; @entity137 6.5			1

@entity95 ’s team were reduced to 10 when @entity104 was sent off after receiving his second caution of the night for his second clumsy challenge of the game			1
ill - feeling simmered as the managers made their changes			0
@entity95 tried to restructure his defence while @entity28 boss @entity227 threw on all the strikers he could find			2
on came @entity240 , @entity197 ’s record transfer , a £ 12million disaster for the @entity243 , and then came @entity75			0
@entity10 looked destined to keep the ball out of his net with a blend of skill and good fortune			0
@entity166 glanced a header wide , promising opportunities were created and squandered , until the final few seconds			0
the clock was slipping past 90 minutes when @entity10 flung himself to his left to block a crisp shot on the turn from @entity75 , but his save dropped to @entity255 defender @entity33 , who scored , crashing a volley into the turf and spinning over the goalkeeper			2
rash challenge : @entity104 of @entity8 lunges in on @entity161 of @entity28 i can see trouble ahead : @entity104 ( @entity205 ) approaches the referee knowing he has already received a caution early shower : @entity104 is sent off for a second bookable offence in the second - half distraught : the @entity269 defender leaves the field with his team protecting a 1 - 0 lead with their extra man , @entity28 sensed their chance and went for it			1
@entity10 tipped over a header from @entity124 before extra-time , a manic half - hour of end - to - end chaos			1
both teams reshuffled but muscles were exhausted in the mugginess of @entity101			0
touches became heavier and more passes went astray			0
there were spaces everywhere but no - one made it count			0
@entity124 led a @entity28 counter-attack with a five - on - three advantage but @entity292 could not beat the excellent @entity8 goalkeeper			1
another chance fell to @entity124 in added time at the end of extra-time but he dragged it wide			0
it was destined for penalties			0
and @entity10 was destined to be the hero			0
@entity302 royale : @entity182 of @entity8 and @entity33 of @entity28 compete for the ball @entity304 : @entity305 striker @entity182 ( r ) provided the attacking intent for @entity8 down but not out ! @entity182 has been promised an opportunity at the @entity308 next season best effort : @entity157 ( r ) has a close - range shot in the most exciting moment from the first - half super saver ! @entity8 's goalkeeper @entity10 ( @entity205 ) watches the ball sail wide after making an excellent stop denied ! @entity28 's @entity157 ( @entity205 ) rolls on the ground after seeing his first - half effort saved handbags : @entity28 players surround the referee after @entity214 ( c ) appeared to be brought down uninspiring beginning : @entity63 of @entity8 challenges @entity28 's @entity224 in the first - half aerial duel : @entity166 ( @entity205 ) of @entity28 controls the ball against @entity104 of @entity8 meet the boss : @entity28 coach @entity227 ( @entity205 ) and @entity8 's @entity95 head to the dugout king of the castle : @entity331 president @entity330 picked a strange match to attend in @entity333 @entity66 goddess : a @entity28 fan is all smiles before the kick - off at the @entity338 blurred lines : @entity8 fans wearing face paint sound a rally cry before the game flying the flag ! @entity8 fans soak up the atmosphere prior to the round of 16 match feeling nervous ? a @entity28 fan looks on before the start of the game against @entity8			1
