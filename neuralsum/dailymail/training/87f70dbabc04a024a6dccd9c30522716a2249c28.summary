by @entity0 , @entity1 editor @entity2 has developed a wristband that will allow wearers to pay for a morning coffee as well as their daily commute			0
wearers swipe the bands , which can be worn 24 hours a day , over a terminal at a shop or pay point on the bus or station platform to make a purchase			2
the @entity16 bands are part of a wider revolution in wearable technology , which will allow people to negotiate daily life without using cash			1
wearers swipe the bands , which can be worn 24 hours a day , over a terminal at a shop or pay point on the bus or station platform to make a purchase of they can be used as here to get access to a gig all the major tech giants , such as @entity35 and @entity36 , have developed or are working on smart watches , which will have a range of functions , from monitoring heart rate to giving directions			2
significantly , they are also expected to become virtual wallets that allow people to negotiate their day without the need for money or cards			1
the @entity16 bands are effectively loaded with money by users from their bank accounts which can then be spent on small purchases up to a single transaction value of £ 20 by swiping them over a terminal			1
they can also replace conventional plastic cards by allowing people to make purchases much more quickly than normal because users do not need to use a four digit pin			1
the rubberised and waterproof bands , which contain a computer chip and micro-aerial to communicate with terminals , have the security benefit that they are less likely to be lost or stolen than a wallet or purse			2
the @entity16 bands have been trialled to the public at public events such as the @entity66 and @entity67 , where they can be used to gain entry and buy food and drink			1
however , they are now moving into the mainstream so that they can be used at any one of around 300,000 till terminals – many in coffee shops and newsagents - that already work with contactless debit cards			0
the @entity16 bands have been trialled to the public at public events such as the @entity66 and @entity67 , where they can be used to gain entry and buy food and drink it will be possible to pay for journeys on all buses , tubes and trains inside @entity86 by swiping them across terminals from later this year			1
other towns and cities are expected to follow suit			0
a @entity2 spokesman said : ‘ just imagine a typical day in the near future			0
you leave the house , hop on the train and head to the gym			0
after your workout , you grab a coffee and go to the office			0
the money or information you need for every stage of that journey will be integrated into a single device like @entity16 band – from your travel card to your gym membership to the money for your coffee and lunch			1
‘ it ’s a time that is n’t quite here yet , but it ’s not far away			0
innovations like @entity16 band are bringing it closer every day			1
’ @entity2 introduced the first credit card in the @entity115 , the @entity116 in 1966 , while the company then released the first contactless debit cards , which allow payments via swiping at terminals rather than pin numbers , in 2007			0
as the country ’s biggest credit card provider with more than 10 million accounts it is in a particularly powerful position to change the way people spend their money			1
@entity116 chief executive , @entity130 , said it is working with @entity132 , retailers and consumers to win acceptance of the technology			0
‘ we ’re the only financial institution in the @entity115 that has both sides of the equation ; we can actually create the tipping point , ’ she said			0
contactless : @entity116 chief executive , @entity130 , said that the company is working with @entity132 , retailers and consumers to win acceptance of the technology the technology that works with contactless cards and wrist bands can also be built into other products such as mobile phones , key fobs and rings			2
the banking industry is keen for people to switch away from using cash because it is much more expensive for them to handle , transport and count real money than virtual electronic payments			1
consequently , the quicker they can convert people to new forms of payment the more money they can save			2
the net result of these efforts is that cash is expected to account for less than half of transactions for the first time this year , after falling to 53 per cent in 2013			2
there is an added benefit for the banks because they charge a small fee to retailers every time a transaction is made – a bill that will inevitably end up at the door of consumers .			0
