discovered in @entity5 , south west of modern @entity6 in 1923 , the so - called @entity2 ’s fire making capabilities have , up until now , been merely a theory			1
now , researchers have solid proof of the skill after analysing ash from the archaeological site known locally as ‘ @entity5 ’			1
the ' @entity2 ' , an ancient human ancestor that lived between 750,000 and 200,000 years ago , was an expert at lighting fires			1
pictured is the excavation site discoveries : a bust of the @entity2 at the @entity21 , @entity6 this is the latest piece of a puzzle that scientists have been putting together over the past decade to build up a remarkable account of what life was like for the early human			1
recent age determinations have shown that @entity2 lived in the area around 770,000 year ago , when weather conditions in @entity32 were relatively cold			1
in order to survive the harsh weather , @entity2 would have needed to be able to create and manage fire			1
this theory been widely accepted since 1931			0
to test this idea , dr @entity38 , from the @entity39 ( @entity39 ) in @entity32 , looked at four soil samples obtained from the site			0
his team demonstrated that all four samples contained siliceous aggregates as well as elemental carbon , and the potassium content of the insoluble residues			0
they claim this analysis provides ‘ very strong ’ evidence for the onsite use of fire by @entity2			1
dr @entity38 , from the @entity39 ( @entity39 ) in @entity32 , looked at four soil samples obtained from the site			0
a photomicrograph of one of the soil samples is pictured here @entity2 , an ancient human ancestor that lived between 750,000 and 200,000 years ago			1
in order to survive the harsh weather , @entity2 would have needed to be able to create and manage fire , and now there is solid proof to back this theory			1
the @entity2 was outfitted , wearing animal hides that had been softened using stone tools			2
belonging to the species @entity67 , the @entity2 was also able to make bizarrely drilled holed in objects for as yet unknown reasons			2
‘ at present , the key point of the debate over the intentional use of fire by @entity2 at @entity5 is whether or not siliceous aggregate ( an insoluble phase of burned ash ) is present in ash remains recovered from the site ’ , said dr @entity38			1
the re-excavation , in the village of @entity5 , near @entity6 , has unearthed fascinating details proving our ancestors were more advanced than previously believed			1
the @entity2 was outfitted , wearing animal hides that had been softened using stone tools			2
belonging to the species @entity67 , the @entity2 was also able to make bizarrely drilled holed in objects for as yet unknown reasons			2
using powerful microscopes , the scientists have also examined tools used by the @entity2 to gain more details about their use			2
scientists from the @entity95 said that a 3,000 - year - old living room , or ' activity floor ' , had been discovered in the cave , containing what could be a fireplace			2
scientists have re-excavated the cave in the village of @entity5 , near @entity6 , where fossils of early humans , dubbed the @entity2 , were initially found @entity105 , a curator at the @entity106 and a special member of the academy , said that it was also likely the species had attached stone points to sticks , creating spears			1
the discovery could be significant as it shows the @entity2 potentially joining two materials to form a tool			2
the @entity118 cave system is one of the most important palaeolithic sites ever discovered			0
archaeologists unearthed thousands of stone tools and hundreds of fragmentary remains from about 40 early humans as they worked on the site between 1921 and 1966			2
the human remains discovered in the cave were later assigned to the species homo erectus			0
the original fossils of the @entity2 vanished in 1941 as they were being transported to @entity130 at the peak of @entity132 a number of techniques have attempted to accurately date the remains numerous times over the years but have failed to find a definitive answer			0
the @entity2 was discovered in @entity5 , south west of modern @entity6 in 1923 the famous @entity2 skull went missing after in 1941 when it was being transported to the @entity130 from @entity32 during @entity132			1
scientists have revisited the site to discover more details about our ancient ancestor @entity145 scientist @entity144 and @entity130 colleague @entity146 first arrived in @entity5 in 1921 where they were directed to the site by quarrymen			1
upon arrival at the cave @entity144 announced : ' here is primitive man , now all we have to do is find him			0
' the confidence was well - founded as the scientists had just discovered what would become one of the most important paleontological sites in the world			0
@entity160 found human molars at the site but it was @entity165 scientist @entity164 who made some of the most significant discoveries , despite his initial findings being treated with scepticism by scientists around the world			1
around 200 fossils were gathered until excavation came to an end in 1937 with the @entity177 invasion			0
fossils were placed in the @entity179 of the @entity180 for safe - keeping , before being packed up for the @entity130 in 1941			0
but the fossils were inexplicably lost as they were being transported through northern @entity32			0
it is still unknown what happened to the fossils with some believing they sank on @entity177 ship the @entity187 in 1945			0
@entity130 financier @entity188 appealed for information on their whereabouts in 1972 , promising a reward of $ 5,000			0
one woman made contact , demanding $ 500,000 , but this failed to materialise			0
the @entity118 government also initiated a committee to locate the fossils to coincide with the 60th anniversary of the end of @entity202 fossils , however , have yet to be located .			0

@entity2 was discovered in @entity5 , south west of @entity6 , in 1923
up until now , the early human *'s* fire - making capabilities were merely a theory
but researchers have found solid proof of the skill after analysing ash from the archaeological site known locally as ‘ @entity5 ’
