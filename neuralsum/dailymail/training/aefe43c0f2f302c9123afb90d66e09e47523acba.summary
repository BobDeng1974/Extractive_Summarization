by @entity1 reporter published : 17:55 est , 4 november 2013 updated : 08:05 est , 5 november 2013 @entity3 teens seeking weight - loss surgery have a startling number of health problems that used to be seen only in adults , according to a major government - funded study			1
half the teens had at least four major illnesses linked with their excess weight			1
three out of four had cholesterol problems ; almost half had high blood pressure or joint pain ; and many had diseased livers or kidneys			1
these kids weighed three times more than what is considered healthy , they were n't just teens ‘ who want to fit into that cheerleading outfit better , ’ said dr. @entity27 , the study 's lead researcher and a surgeon at @entity30			2
while it is a drastic , last - ditch option , major complications including accidental injury to internal organs occurred in just eight percent of teens			2
less serious complications including bleeding and dehydration affected 15 percent of kids during the first month after surgery			0
the study involved 242 teens who had surgery at five @entity3 centers from 2007 through 2011			1
results for the first month after surgery were released online on monday in the journal @entity60			0
the @entity61 paid for the study			0
in a recent scientific statement , the @entity63 said obesity surgery may be the most effective treatment for what it called ‘ severe obesity ’ in teens , a condition it said affects about five percent of @entity3 children and is increasing nationwide			1
half of the teens surveyed had at least four major illnesses linked to their excess weight including high cholesterol , high blood pressure , joint pain , diseased livers and kidneys the group 's threshold for severe obesity is a body mass index of at least 35 ; the average @entity87 in the study was 51			1
because lifestyle changes and medication rarely work for such obese teens , the statement says obesity surgery should be considered for those with related health problems who are psychologically mature enough to handle it			1
the new results bolster evidence from smaller studies in teens and also suggest teens may do better , at least initially , than adults			0
earlier 30 - day research in adults found a few deaths after obesity surgery , although the risk was no greater than for other major operations			1
there were no deaths in the teen study			0
a three - year follow - up report on more than 2,000 patients in the adult study was also published online monday in the @entity115			0
@entity116 holds a photo of herself made three years ago at the age of 17 before she had obesity surgery , in @entity120 , @entity121			2
@entity122 had weighed 314 pounds and is now about 170 pounds it showed adults generally had fewer obesity - related illnesses than in the teen study , and most weight loss occurred within the first year after surgery			1
gastric bypass surgery , the most common operation in the @entity3 , resulted in more weight loss and more improvement in related illnesses than stomach banding , as other studies have shown			1
three - year death rates were low , and similar for both procedures , but band patients had many more repeat surgeries			0
in the teen study , whether obesity surgery resulted in lasting weight loss and better health remains to be seen ; the researchers are still following the participants and calculating data			1
but anecdotal reports from the teens suggest they 're doing pretty well			0
@entity116 of @entity30 has shrunk from 314 to 170 pounds - almost half her previous size - since having surgery three years ago at age 17 at @entity30 's			2
before surgery , @entity116 had a hormonal problem , heart blockage and sleep apnea - all linked with obesity and all have since subsided since her surgery before surgery , @entity122 had a hormonal problem , heart blockage and sleep apnea - all linked with obesity and all have since subsided			2
‘ i feel good , i can pretty much physically do anything , ’ said @entity122 , now in nursing school			0
like 28 percent of the teens studied , she had gastric sleeve surgery , which involves removing part of the stomach and creating a smaller tube or sleeve - shaped stomach			2
she has to be careful about eating only small portions of foods , to avoid getting sick , but said otherwise she has no food restrictions			0
some teens in the study say they can no longer tolerate certain foods , including sugar , meat or dairy products			0
most teens had gastric bypass or stomach stapling , which creates a small pouch in the stomach and attaches it to the intestines			0
a handful had gastric band operations , in which surgeons position an adjustable band around the top of the stomach , and inflate it to shrink the stomach			0
this operation has not been approved for @entity3 teens			2
the results of the new survey bolster existing evidence that suggest teens may do better - at least initially - than adults after having obesity surgery ( file pic ) @entity27 , a pioneer in obesity surgery in teens , says he does about 30 to 40 operations each year at @entity30 's and the numbers have increased slightly in recent years			1
kids must be severely obese to qualify			0
but many are so large that even when surgery results in substantial weight loss and better health , they ca n't shrink their @entity87 to below the obese range , @entity27 said			0
that underscores the need to find ways to prevent severe obesity , he said			2
@entity218 heart specialist dr. @entity216 , an @entity63 spokesman , said the study shows obesity surgery should be considered a reasonable approach for kids , but that the study results may represent a best - case scenario , since surgeons involved were all highly experienced			1
parents seeking obesity surgery for their teens should have them evaluated in centers that do lots of these operations , he said .			1

government - funded study found that obesity surgery is safe for teens
it is the most effective treatment for severe obesity , according to the @entity63
condition affects about five percent of @entity3 children and that number is growing
half teens surveyed had at least four major illnesses linked to their excess weight
these included high cholesterol , high blood pressure , joint pain , diseased livers and kidneys
