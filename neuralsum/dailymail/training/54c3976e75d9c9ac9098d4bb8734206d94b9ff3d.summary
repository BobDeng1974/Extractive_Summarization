by @entity0 this sucks : @entity2 tries leech therapy in the hope that it will cure her migranes they undulate through the water in their glass bowl , the shiny black shapes glinting as they catch the light			1
and when i peer closely at the leeches , i am sure they writhe and wriggle faster – excited as they sense me , their next meal			1
these bloodsuckers are about to be put on my face			2
their ‘ keeper ’ , @entity22 , puts her tweezers in the water to catch one			2
‘ they are very hungry , ’ she says in her jolly eastern @entity24 accent			2
‘ you are going to be their last supper ! ’ i am drawn to things dark and gruesome			2
and it does n’t get much more gruesome than having bloodsuckers attached to your personage			2
dear lord , what have i let myself in for ? as @entity37 advances towards me , with a long black slimy creature wriggling in the grip of her tweezers , i remind myself just how bad my migraines are , and how i would go to any lengths to get rid of them			2
the word headache does n’t even begin to describe them – as the eight million @entity47 who suffer from migraines will no doubt agree			2
migraines are miserable with bells on – actually , the idea of listening to the sound of a bell with a migraine brings me out in a sweat			2
when i am suffering with one , i ca n’t even stand the sound of my sheets rustling			2
apart from the intense throbbing , all - encompassing pain in my head , i also feel extremely nauseous and sensitive to light			2
i feel as if i am a vampire – a small sliver of daylight and @entity63 : i will spontaneously combust			2
but do n’t just take my word for it : severe migraine attacks are classified by the @entity67 as among the most disabling illnesses , comparable to dementia , quadriplegia and psychosis			2
i had my first migraine at boarding school when i was 15			0
it was a hot summer , and when the school gardener got going with his lawnmower outside my window , i literally wanted to die			0
oddly , i did n’t have another one until my 20s and since then they have struck sporadically – i could go for six months without suffering , then there would be a whole week of agony			0
say hello to my little friend : ¿ @entity83 ¿ @entity37 shows @entity0 the leeches which are about to be places on her face to feast on her blood some find there are triggers : hormonal cycles , stress , red wine			1
but mine hit me without rhyme or reason			0
which is why i decided to give leech therapy , or hirudotherapy – to give the treatment its correct medical term – a go			1
as a believer in alternative medicine , i wanted to try something natural and holistic that did n’t involve days spent downing industrial - strength analgesics			0
i remembered reading about @entity107 having leech therapy at a clinic in @entity110 last year			1
the actress had the treatment to ‘ detoxify her blood ’ as part of an alternative beauty therapy			1
‘ i have always been somebody looking for the cutting edge of things that are optimising your health and healing , ’ she said afterwards			0
if it ’s good enough for @entity107 , it ’s good enough for me , i thought			0
living in @entity125 now , i have seen @entity107 in the flesh			0
up close , believe it or not , she is a natural beauty , very un-hollywood			0
no fillers or collagen that i could detect			0
so if the leeches could do things for my appearance as well as my health , then all the better			1
and before you put me and @entity107 in a box marked ‘ complete loons ’ , it seems modern medicine is also looking to this rather medieval practice as a solution for a host of ailments			0
vampire weekend : alicija careful places the leaches on @entity0 's face to start the migrane treatment in the 1980s , leeches began to be used by reconstructive plastic surgeons needing to remove stagnant blood from reattached limbs , to stave off gangrene			1
but now there are numerous studies into medical uses for leeches			1
one found that a single session of leeching – the medical application of bloodsucking leeches – can significantly reduce knee pain caused by arthritis for at least two months			1
researchers from the @entity164 in @entity165 claimed improvement levels were comparable to those achieved with daily moderate doses of painkillers such as ibuprofen			0
and before you say you ’d probably rather pop a pill , consider the damage regularly taking painkillers can do to the stomach			0
bloodletting is the withdrawal of quantities of blood from a patient to cure or prevent illness and disease			1
evidence of the practice dates back 3,000 years to @entity184			1
it was widespread in mid- 19th @entity186 , when six million leeches were imported each year for this purpose			1
though doctors recommended it – fevers , apoplexy and headaches were thought to be caused by ‘ too much blood ’ – barbers carried out the procedure			1
leeches – parasitic worms that feed on blood – were used as an alternative to just cutting the patient ’s arm to release blood			1
the withdrawal of enough blood to induce syncope ( fainting ) was considered beneficial , and many sessions would end only when the patient began to swoon			1
bloodletting was discredited at the end of the @entity211 as doctors felt it left patients weak and prone to infection , but it has had a recent resurgence , with a wave of celebrities trying it			0
another clinical trial at the university is investigating whether nerve pain caused by shingles could also be remedied by leeching			0
the secret is in the leeches ’ saliva : it apparently contains a large number of analgesic , anaesthetic , and blood - thinning compounds that tackle pain and inflammation , say the researchers			1
@entity234 led me to @entity37 , a @entity238 / @entity237 hirudotherapist with ten years ’ experience			0
she is based in @entity241 and @entity242 but she has clients from all around the world			0
her passion for natural medicine goes back to her childhood in 1960s @entity237 , where leeches were used as a popular ‘ country healing method ’ to cure various health problems			1
back then , @entity22 reminisces , leeches were sold at many pharmacies			1
her grandmother would bring one home whenever any family member got sick , pop it on for an hour , and everything would be better			0
i called her and within five minutes i was swept away by her passion for leeches , or ‘ black pearls ’ , as she describes them			1
these are n’t your common - or - garden leeches ( there are more than 700 species that live wild in freshwater and marine environments – one once attached itself to my buttock while i was bathing in the @entity271 river in @entity272 )			1
medicinal leeches are specially cultivated in a sterile environment			1
the largest leech farm in the world – biopharm in @entity278 , @entity279 – was established in 1812 , moving to its current base in 1984			1
@entity281 has treated people with all sorts of conditions and illnesses , from infertility to heart conditions to alopecia , and even runs a hirudotherapy training school			1
she says the secretions from leeches ’ saliva can be used to treat the entire spectrum of physiology : blood - clotting , digestion , connective tissue , disease , pain , inhibition of enzymes , and as a treatment for inflammation			1
go with the flow : an illustration showing a doctor performing bloodletting on a man armed with this information , and her assurance that she had helped many migraine patients live pain - free , i find myself reclining on my living - room sofa waiting for a leech to bite into me for the first time			1
it is – how can i put it politely ? – an unusual experience			0
for a start , when they sense ( i am told , smell ) flesh , they wiggle and crane their heads toward you			0
but the worst part is the anticipation			0
it ’s like getting an injection – the sensible thing is not to look at the needle , though i find it impossible not to			0
and so it is with the wriggling leech			1
just before it bit into me , i could feel its cold and slimy body against my temple			0
but once it actually did , i was relieved that it felt like no more than a mild sting – the leech secretes an anaesthetic that numbs the skin , otherwise the pain would be unbearable			1
@entity345 is a million times worse			0
once @entity37 is sure the leech has got to work , then it ’s time for the next one , and the one after that , until you have four attached to you			1
you can definitely feel them working – it is a mild tugging sensation			0
i know this sounds extraordinary , but i felt incredibly relaxed			0
the treatment takes about 40 minutes , until the leech is full and falls off , leaving a mark in the shape of a peace sign			1
they swell to about four times their normal size , as they become gorged with blood			2
once the leeches have done their job , @entity37 sends them off to leech heaven by putting them in alcohol ( she says it upsets her every time ) as reusing them would risk cross-infections			1
the few hours after the treatment are not for the squeamish – as you do continue to bleed			0
the next day , i felt exhausted but wonderful			0
within a few days , the wounds scab and disappear			0
to get the most out of hirudotherapy , you need about three sessions within weeks of each other			2
i have not had a migraine since that first session			0
more than that , i feel rejuvenated			0
leeches really are miracle workers			2
i am a total convert .			0
