click here to read @entity2 's full match report from @entity3 @entity4 is under serious pressure for the first time in his reign as @entity9 manager			1
there is no suggestion that the worst @entity13 campaign in the club ’s history will cost @entity4 his job , as he retains @entity18 ’s full support			1
but , after tuesday ’s insipid 1 - 1 draw with @entity20 , @entity4 accepted that the scrutiny on him is building with each bad result			1
somehow he must reverse the negative spiral @entity9 are in , particularly as the next three games — clashes with @entity26 and @entity27 in the @entity29 sandwich a @entity31 quarter - final at @entity32 — are pivotal			2
@entity33 examines the key issues			0
@entity4 speaks to his players as @entity9 crash out of the @entity13 at the group stage the @entity9 boss accepts that recent results have left him under increasing pressure at @entity3 @entity41 looks dejected after the @entity20 defeat ... in what could be his last @entity13 game what is his best team ? after spending in excess of £ 100million last summer , you would think there would be some stability to the sides @entity4 is sending out			1
the reality , however , is different			0
@entity9 have played 23 games in all competitions this season and @entity4 has named 23 different selections			1
not since @entity9 were beaten 2 - 0 by @entity57 on april 27 — the game that ultimately cost them the @entity29 title — has @entity4 named the same team , and the leaky defence has been subject to constant change			1
@entity64 stares at the ground as @entity20 players celebrate qualifying for the knockout stages too many of @entity4 ' signings , including @entity70 ( centre ) and @entity72 ( right ) have n't performed click here to read @entity33 's analysis on what progress @entity4 has made at @entity3 the concern at the moment is that no matter what personnel or system @entity4 deploys , performances are not improving			1
is there an argument for him to put his faith in a certain 11 and formation and persist until results change ? ‘ if you need to win , why not put them under pressure from the word go ? ’ said former @entity9 boss @entity86			1
‘ we waited until we were down to 10 men with 20 minutes to go , then threw everything at them			0
why not do it from the start ? the way we approached the game was a bit negative			0
’ change the atmosphere when results are good , harmony reigns			2
once they begin to tail off , though , the ambience dips and the manner in which @entity9 ’s fortunes have plummeted this season has had an impact on the morale of the squad			2
captain @entity41 celebrates after scoring a late free - kick , but it was too little , too late for @entity9 @entity4 cuts a lonely figure as he walks off the pitch - knowing the situation has to improve so assured when they were on top of their game last year , the team ’s faltering confidence has now eroded performance levels			1
that was never more apparent than after 42 seconds against @entity20 when @entity124 , @entity64 and @entity70 passed the ball as if it was a hot potato			2
the dressing room was , once again , very subdued after their exit from the @entity13 and @entity4 will be aware of how crucial it is to @entity9 ’s fortunes not to let the atmosphere fester			1
he sets the tone at @entity132 and he must remain on the front foot			0
@entity134 @entity135 the mood around @entity3 changed for the better in the 62nd minute against @entity20 when @entity41 thundered into a challenge and emerged with the ball			1
@entity9 supporters like good footballers but they also like players with a mean streak			2
@entity9 , aside from their captain @entity41 , appear to be a team lacking in aggression @entity147 ( centre ) walks off the pitch as @entity9 contemplate thursday nights in the @entity151 are @entity9 too soft ? it could be that they are too nice			1
when they played @entity153 at @entity3 , they barely laid a glove on the champions and never threatened to make things uncomfortable			2
that criticism has been recurring			0
the result means @entity9 finished third in @entity159 behind @entity153 and @entity20 one player who has been missed and would give @entity9 an ‘ edge ’ is injured defender @entity162			1
they could do with someone else to give them steel			0
@entity9 do n’t have huge sums to spend in january but , perhaps , whatever cash there is should go on an enforcer			0
ride out the storm @entity4 has made a point of saying that some defeats ‘ can be the making ’ of you but there is no doubt the criticism of his team , results and himself will be stinging him			1
take this from @entity180 , whose medals in a 13 - year @entity3 career include a @entity183			1
‘ if things do n’t change then ultimately @entity4 will pay the price , ’ said @entity184			2
‘ if this team keeps performing the way they are , i do n’t think they ’ll have another option			0
we are not even halfway through and most people do n’t expect @entity9 to get into the top four			0
@entity20 's @entity193 ( centre ) wheels away after opening the scoring on an insipid night at @entity3 a @entity9 supporter makes his feelings clear as the @entity3 club are knocked out of the @entity13 ‘ you wonder where this team are going			1
he has tried to add to the squad to make it better			0
somehow it has turned the other way			0
the team are completely rudderless			0
they do n’t look to have any imagination going forward and defensively they look at odds			0
this is a desperate time for @entity9			0
’ the reaction on social media and radio phone - ins saw some supporters ask for him to be removed , less than seven months after being named @entity214 , but there is no chance owners @entity18 will dispense with him soon after giving him a new contract			0
what they do expect , is to be back in the top four come may			0
if @entity4 is to achieve that , he needs to get results			2

@entity4 is under scrutiny after @entity9 crashed out of the @entity13 following a 1 - 1 draw with @entity20
former @entity229 manager @entity86 has criticised team selection and *tactics*
the atmosphere at @entity3 needs to improve to *restore* players ' confidence
injured defender @entity162 would return some missing aggression
@entity180 says the manager will pay the price if results do n't improve
