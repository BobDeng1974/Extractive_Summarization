the vast proportion of the world 's fossil fuels must remain buried in the ground if global warming targets are to be met , according to a new study			1
more than 80 per cent of the known coal deposits , a third of the world 's oil reserves and half of the gas must not be burned before 2050 if temperature increases are to be kept to within two degrees c of pre-industrial levels			1
even then world leaders will face just a fifty per cent chance of meeting their goal of capping warming to these levels			0
a third of the world 's crude oil , like above , will have to remain untapped underground to limit climate change last year the @entity25 @entity24 warned that the world was on course to experience ' dangerous ' levels of global warming unless greenhouse gas emissions could be capped			1
if fossil fuels continue to be burned at the current rate , it warned , then the world was on track to warm by more than 5 degrees c by the end of the century			1
the latest study , published in the journal nature , experts at @entity42 's @entity41 , assessed how much fossil fuel could be extracted to meet the two degree limit			2
it found that 223 billion fewer barrels of oil and 290 billion fewer tonnes of coal should be burned to meet this goal			1
the researchers also examined the implications for different regions of the world should it attempt to reach this goal			0
they said that @entity57 , @entity58 and the @entity59 would suffer most as they are forced to leave the majority of their huge coal reserves untapped , having a major impact on industry and the economies in these regions			1
more than 260 billion barrels of oil will have to remain unused in the @entity70 - equivalent to the entire oil reserves in @entity72			1
the @entity70 should also leave more than 60 per cent of its gas reserves in the ground			1
the @entity25 's @entity24 , chaired by @entity75 ( above ) , has warned that global warming needs to be limited to within two degrees @entity77 if it wants to avoid dangerous climate change the @entity59 , which transports large amounts of coal via barge on the @entity82 ( above ) will have to leave the majority of its coal reserves untapped , something that could have a huge impact on its industry and economy the researchers also urged against development of the hard to reach resources in the @entity91 as the oil there and said it should be classified as unburnable			1
countries like @entity96 and @entity58 are thought to be keen to tap into the estimated 100 billion barrels of oil and 35 trillion cubic metres of gas in the @entity100			2
however , the researchers said that shale oil and gas resources , which are currently being explored as a new source of energy in the @entity105 , could safely be developed in @entity106 , but would have to be balanced by other fossil fuels remaining unburned elsewhere			2
the study also found that new technology that is aimed at reducing the amount of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere by burning fossil fuels - known as carbon capture storage - will not have any impact until after 2050			1
while the @entity59 is a major producer of oil from wells like those above , the @entity70 is most likely to suffer as a result of attempts to leave oil reserves untapped as it will need to leave 260 million barrels in the ground carbon capture storage technology , that aims to strip carbon dioxide out of emissions from coal fired power stations like above , is too expensive and immature to have much of an impact before 2050 , the study warns they might be fluffy faced , buck - toothed little creatures , but two species of rodent have been identified the latest culprits to be contributing to climate change researchers have found that the arctic ground squirrel and the beaver may be playing a far greater role in global warming than had previously been realised			1
it means that scientists will in the future have to alter their theories around anthropogenic climate change to take account of ' rodentopogenic ' influences			2
researchers studying permafrost in the @entity91 found that ground squirrels there are hastening the release of greenhouse gases from the frozen soil where they build their burrows			0
a separate study found that beavers were now causing the release of 200 times more methane from the pond they create than was being released in 1900 due to rising numbers of the creatures			0
this , they say , would mean strict limits will still have to be imposed on how much fossil fuels can be burned before that time			0
dr @entity173 , a researcher at the @entity174 who was amoung the study 's authors , said : ' policy makers must realise that their instincts to completely use the fossil fuels within their countries are wholly incompatible with their commitments to the @entity184 goal			2
' if they go ahead with developing their own resource , they must be asked which reserves elsewhere should remain unburnt in order for the carbon budget not to be exceeded			0
' professor @entity192 , an economist and director of the @entity194 , questioned whether energy companies should have spent Â£ 430 billion in 2013 searching for fossil fuels that can not be burned			2
he added that it may not be worth investing large sums of money in extracting ' the last drops ' of @entity202 oil rather than importing cheaper resources from elsewhere			0
he said : ' they will need to rethink such substantial budgets if policies are implemented to support the 2 degree c limit , especially as new discoveries can not lead to increased aggregate production			0
' dr @entity211 , director of the @entity212 , said that rather than slowing down , fossil fuel consumption was likely to accelerate over the coming decades			0
he said the recent deal between @entity57 and the @entity59 would see @entity57 continue to increase its emissions to a peak level in 2030			0
he said : ' it is unrealistic to expect governments to implement policies that will come even close to these goals of leaving fossil fuels in the ground			0
' the researchers claim that it will make no commercial sense trying to seek out and extract the last remaining reserves in places like the @entity202 ( above ) and companies should concentrate on cheaper resources			0

researchers at @entity42 assessed how much fossil fuels can be burned before 2050 to limit global warming to two degrees *celcius*
study says at least 80 per cent of the world 's coal must stay in the ground
a third of the world 's oil - 223 billion barrels - must also be left unburned
half of the global gas reserves should also be left untapped , say scientists
caps will hit @entity57 , @entity58 , the @entity59 and the @entity70 hardest
carbon capture storage will have little impact until after 2050 , they warn
the @entity25 has warned that greenhouse gas emissions must be capped to prevent ' dangerous ' levels of climate change by 2100
