@entity0 are expected to unveil a string of ambitious new targets when they outline another five - year plan at the @entity7 squad 's @entity5 training camp on sunday			2
team principal sir @entity8 raised eyebrows in 2009 when he announced his aim for a @entity7 @entity12 winner within five years but victories for sir @entity14 in 2012 and @entity15 12 months later ensured his optimism was more than justified			1
now the irrepressible team boss is ready for a fresh challenge			2
sir @entity14 ' relationship with @entity0 will end in april as he prepares to launches own cycling team sir @entity8 is set to announce the five - year plan at the @entity7 training camp in @entity5 this week a chastening experience at last year 's @entity12 means the team will first and foremost be desperate to see @entity15 regain the yellow jersey after he was forced to pull out on stage five following three crashes in two days			1
it will be no easy task for the 29 - year - old , who was initially reluctant to commit to the race given a route which does not seem to favour him compared to reigning champion @entity34 and six - time @entity36 winner @entity35			0
it may also mean a different approach for the team too			0
sir @entity14 will bring an end to a five - and - a - half - year affiliation with @entity0 in april @entity8 insisted last summer he would not " throw the baby out with the bathwater " but last year 's @entity36 was the first time @entity0 had come away without a stage win since their debut in 2010 , and a wider process of reinvigoration may be required			1
aside from the @entity36 , a victory in one of the major @entity51 continues to elude @entity53 's men and the main target will be @entity55 , which gets under way on april 12			0
welsh rider @entity57 , who impressed at the @entity12 , came seventh last time out but the heaviest burden of expectation will sit on the shoulders of @entity61			0
the four - time @entity63 champion finally confirmed the launch of ' @entity65 ' on thursday and @entity55 will likely be the 34 - year - old 's last competitive road race for @entity0 before he returns to the track and diverts his focus entirely towards @entity70			0
@entity71 and @entity72 will be hoping to benefit from the team 's latest innovations in 2015 @entity61 ' final contract with @entity0 expires in april , bringing an end to a five - and - a - half - year affiliation that @entity8 described as " one of the greatest stories in @entity7 sport over the last 10 years "			1
@entity8 will also have to answer questions on doping after another eventful 12 months off the bike			1
the team terminated @entity86 's contract in july after discrepancies were found in his biological passport and they fielded criticism too regarding @entity15 's use of @entity91 ( therapeutic user exemption certificate ) for asthma medication at the @entity94			0
@entity0 's zero - tolerance approach to doping effectively rules out the recruitment of a number of more experienced riders and coaches but , despite boasting a vast budget , @entity53 has always maintained a preference for younger talent			2
@entity57 , @entity71 , @entity104 , @entity105 and @entity72 will be among those hoping to benefit from the team 's latest innovations in 2015			1

boss sir @entity8 ready to announce fresh challenges
