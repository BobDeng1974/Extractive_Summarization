police previously said they found two pipe bombs belonging to @entity13 at the same campsite			1
' because we continue to push @entity13 , and to seize the items he needs to survive , we believe he will be forced to search for food and shelters in other locations , ' said @entity16 , who gave an update on the manhunt three weeks after the shooting that killed cpl. @entity34 and seriously wounded trooper @entity35			1

' you definitely have to stay within a tactical mindset , just so you 're not opening yourself up for a possible attack , at least limiting the possibility of making yourself a target , ' @entity100 said friday			0
the trooper would keep himself out of the glare cast by his car 's headlights , for instance , giving him the ability to observe but not easily be observed			0
@entity100 lives in @entity136 , about 100 miles from the search area			0
troopers throughout @entity53 are signing up to search for @entity13 , he said			2
