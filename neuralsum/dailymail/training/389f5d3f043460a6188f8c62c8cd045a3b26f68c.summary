the victim and a friend had gone to a flat in the city centre where three of the defendants lived to buy drugs from @entity19 , who is said to be a dealer , the court heard			1
prosecutor @entity36 told the jury : ‘ it was n’t a social or friendly visit			0
‘ it was clearly about drugs or a small £ 10 debt and some bad feeling arose from that debt			0
‘ it may be that you will think that having heard all the evidence that @entity9 was trying to obtain more drugs without having paid for them and that ’s why he went around			2
’ less than an hour later he had been fatally knifed having been chased through @entity51 , which is close to the flat where @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 lived			1
mr @entity53 said that @entity55 - although not showing the stabbings - showed mr @entity9 brandishing a pair of tweezers or a small knife towards the defendants			2
‘ at one point @entity19 bares his chest and invites @entity9 to stab him , ’ mr @entity53 said			1
‘ there were witnesses in a car and they describe two men fighting , clearly mr @entity9 and @entity19			1
the court heard that @entity9 was fatally knifed in the chest having been chased through @entity51 , pictured , following an alleged argument over a ' £ 10 drugs deal ' ‘ the witnesses in the car noticed @entity18 and their impression was that she was playing a prominent role in egging the men on to have a go			1
‘ she says to one of the others , referring to @entity17 , “ you meant to be his boy			2
you going to do anything about it now ? ” ‘ it is shortly after that the violence begins and the prosecution say that each of the three men on trial with @entity18 went on to play a part in the attack on @entity9 - ultimately resulting in his death			1
’ mr @entity53 said that after being stabbed in the back , mr @entity9 was shouting and threatening to return ‘ with his boys ’			2
‘ whether that was a meaningful threat or something said in defiance by a wounded or frightened man is something you will perhaps have to consider , ’ he said			0
mr @entity9 ran away across the park , followed by the four defendants , where he was stabbed for a second time , allegedly by @entity19 with a knife taken from the kitchen of the flat			2
‘ it was clearly about drugs or a small £ 10 debt and some bad feeling arose from that debt			0
' - prosecutor @entity36 told the jury people who went to the aid of mr @entity9 thought he had been in a collision with a car as he was lying in the road			2
‘ @entity120 , a security guard , noticed that very near to the wound and sticking through a leather jacket was the blade of a knife with no handle , ’ mr @entity53 said			0
‘ it is unclear how and at what point the blade has been pulled out from the wound because it transpired that certain witnesses had seen the blade protruding from the chest of the man as he staggered around and fell			0
’ the knife wound had pierced mr @entity9 ’s heart and he died despite medical treatment			0
after leaving the scene , the four defendants disposed of clothing and went back to the flat to wash before returning to the vicinity where they were quizzed by police and allowed to move on			0
‘ they gave no indication that they knew anything about what had happened , ’ mr @entity53 said			0

@entity17 , @entity19 and @entity18 , of @entity16 , and @entity20 , of no fixed address , deny murder			1
the trial at @entity22 , pictured , has been adjourned until tomorrow ‘ if you conclude it was @entity19 that held the knife that stabbed @entity9 , causing both wounds , you will need to consider the roles of the other three defendants because the prosecution say this was a joint enterprise , where each shoulders joint roles for the murder of mr @entity9			1
‘ indeed if you are not sure it was @entity19 that inflicted the fatal wound , provided you are sure it was one of those defendants that did so and it was the product of joint enterprise , you may convict any defendant you think was part of that			0
’ @entity17 , @entity19 and @entity18 , of @entity16 , and @entity20 , of no fixed address , deny murder			1
