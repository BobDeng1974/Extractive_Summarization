by @entity0 published : 08:28 est , 30 january 2013 updated : 11:40 est , 31 january 2013 what should have been a colourful debate on this morning turned nasty today when the sex therapist invited onto the show unleashed a personal attack on the show 's resident agony aunt			1
@entity8 , who recently spoke out to slam marriage as ' for mugs ' appeared on the breakfast show to defend her claims that marriage is an outdated concept - and that couples would be much happier if they were allowed to seek sexual satisfaction elsewhere			1
but when the @entity17 agony aunt @entity16 replied that she believed unless both couples agreed on an open marriage they should remain faithful , @entity8 turned on her , calling her ' out of touch ' and an ' old battleaxe '			1
@entity22 to head : @entity8 takes on @entity16 over the matter of adultery within marriage - and ends up calling her an ' out of touch battleaxe ' @entity16 , who is a formidable woman at the best of times , looked reasonably shocked by the outburst - but @entity29 and @entity30 were horrified			1
' no one insults our @entity16 , ' said @entity29 , as @entity30 turned away from @entity8 , saying that actually @entity16 gave excellent advice			1
the insult came about after @entity8 had spoken out to defend her choice to have four lovers			2
but as a single woman , @entity29 argued @entity8 was welcome to have as many lovers as she liked			2
@entity16 agreed , saying , ' if a single person wants to have sex with74 people in a week , it 's none of my business			1
' if a married couple agree they both want to have sex elsewhere , it 's none of my business			0
but when one person in a marriage wants to sleep with someone else but the other does n't , it can cause great pain			0
open : @entity8 , who has four lovers , extolls the virtues of an open marriage , saying men and women should be able to seek sex elsewhere outburst : @entity16 looked shocked when @entity8 unleashed a torrent of abuse ' i know from the letters i receive the agony that it causes when one member of a couple is unfaithful , ' @entity16 went on			1
but @entity8 took umbrage at her words - and let her know in no uncertain terms			1
' you are a battleaxe , ' she told a stunned @entity16			2
' you need to get with the modern times			0
you 're an " agony " aunt			2
having an open marriage does n't have to be agony			2
' @entity8 went on to say she believes there is too much pressure on people to get married - meaning too many of use end up trapped in unhappy unions - something she has referred to as the ' prison ' of marriage			1
' if you find the right partner from the off , you wo n't have that problem , ' she says , adding that seeking a lover elsewhere can be the perfect antidote to an unhappy marriage			0
' what 's wrong with that ? ' she asks			0
' make yourself feel great			0
it can help people to lift their vibrations			0
' but , argues @entity16 , does n't that mean you are simply trapped in a prison of a marriage , but you have the added pain of not knowing where your partner is , or with whom ? trouncing : @entity29 and @entity30 were shocked by @entity8 's personal attack on @entity16 , and took great pleasure in reading out the poll results that proved the viewers sided with their agony aunt ' if your marriage is a prison , you should get out , ' says @entity16			1
' i 'm all in favour of getting a divorce and having a new beginning , if that 's the right thing to do			0
' no one should be trapped in a marriage they consider to be a prison			0
' at the end of the debate , with @entity29 and @entity30 shell - shocked and @entity16 storing up some choice words she later said she could easily have unleashed on @entity8 , the presenters turned to the viewers poll to see whether they agreed with @entity8 and her take on marriage , or with @entity16			1
unsurprisingly , 93 per cent of the viewers sided with @entity16 , while just seven per cent were on @entity8 's side			1
@entity29 and @entity30 took great pleasure in highlighting the disparity , telling @entity8 they believed it was the most convincing defeat in the history of the show			1
as @entity29 said , nobody messes with our @entity16			2
after the show , @entity8 said : ' my argument on the show , and which i make in my book , is that people have to find the relationship model which works for them			2
' if you still believe a relationship model which is 300 years old is still relevant today then perhaps you are a battleaxe			0
' i do n't regret what i said to @entity16			2
her model is outdated and i do n't think she lives in the real world			0
' she needs to see how many affairs are going on out there			0
she is out of touch			0
she is very stuck in her beliefs about the traditional relationship model and wo n't accept any new ideas			0
' @entity158 calls @entity16 an old battleaxe on this morning watch the explosive interview in full at @entity161 @entity163 's new book , @entity164 , is available on @entity165 via @entity166			1
