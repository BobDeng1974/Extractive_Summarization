a family watching a dolphin from their boat were shocked when it dropped them off a cod supper for dinner			1
the group were enjoying watching the mammal frolic in the water when it suddenly dived down and caught the cod before placing it near to @entity13 , 14			1
the dolphin then then resurfaced and began nudging the fish towards the stunned teenager			1
fish supper : @entity13 proudly holds the 10lb cod given to her by a friendly dolphin off @entity20 in @entity21 @entity13 and her grandparents wondered whether they should pick up the fish in case the dolphin wanted it for tea			1
but the dolphin then appeared seconds later with his own fish , this time a seabass , and began tucking in			1
the family gratefully scooped up the cod , which weighed a massive 10lbs , before taking it home to nearby @entity35 in @entity21 to cook for their dinner			1
@entity13 said : ' he definitely wanted me to have his fish			1
he first dropped it 20ft away but then pushed it to within 5ft of my kayak			0
' everyone was watching on the beach and we caused quite a stir when we paddled in with the cod. ' grandmother @entity48 added : ' it was as if he was saying to @entity13 " do n't worry , now i 've got a fish to play with and so have you			1
this is mine for my tea , you have that one for yours			2
" ' he was just so playful and content to be around us			0
@entity13 was dangling her fingers in the water and he seemed to be attracted by that			1
just call me @entity63 : a photo of the dolphin which is making waves with locals in @entity20 ' if i had n't seen it myself i 'd never have believed it			1
my theory is that he was lonely and wanted human company			0
he was with us for about two hours			0
' it seemed rude to refuse him so we took the fish and had cod and chips for supper			2
' it was massive - i 've still got half in the freezer			2
' @entity13 was paddling off @entity82 with @entity83 and @entity48 , both , 52 , when they encountered the dolphin			1
the animal has become so popular with locals who have christened him @entity63			0
@entity48 , a swimming club coach , said the july 25 sighting was the highlight of @entity13 's school holidays			2
she said : ' we feel so privileged to have been there			0
@entity13 loves dolphins and has always wanted to swim with them			2
' well she did n't get to swim with this one , but it is the first time she has seen one out of captivity			0
' with the crystal clear water , it was such an experience			0
' a spokesman for @entity103 and @entity104 said : ' this is a very interesting account			0
' there are many examples worldwide of dolphins interacting with humans			0
we would just make our usual appeal for people to generally keep their distance			0
' @entity114 can sometimes become distracted by humans , lose their awareness of nearby motor boats and sustain injuries			0

@entity13 , 14 , was *admiring* the dolphin with her family in @entity21
mammal *jumped* out of the water and placed fish near to the teenager
at first they did n't know whether to take the cod but dolphin *reappeared* with its own dinner - a seabass
the family gratefully scooped up the cod and took it home for tea
