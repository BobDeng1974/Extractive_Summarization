in a rare outreach to @entity4 's @entity3 ayatollah @entity2 , president @entity0 has written a letter about the fight against @entity8 militants - a development that sparked uproar in some congressional circles			1
the @entity12 and @entity4 are each engaged in military efforts to degrade the @entity8 group , essentially putting the longtime foes on the same side in the campaign against the extremists			2
however , the @entity0 administration has repeatedly insisted that it is not coordinating and will not coordinate its military actions with @entity4 , though officials from both countries have discussed the matter more broadly			0
secret communique : president @entity0 ( left ) has written a letter to @entity4 's @entity3 ayatollah @entity2 ( right ) about the fight against @entity8 militants in reaction to the secret missive from the commander - in - chief , a senior congressional source told @entity31 that it could damage @entity12 ’s fledgling relationship with @entity34 - led states in the region			1
‘ this f * * * s up everything , ’ the source put in bluntly , adding that the president should have informed @entity38 about his diplomatic efforts			0
@entity0 's letter to @entity4 's powerful religious leader comes against the backdrop of the looming november 24 deadline in nuclear negotiations between the @entity12 and @entity4 , as well as five other world powers			1
while @entity0 has previously sent three letters to @entity2 , any communication between the two men has been extremely rare			0
the @entity51 , which first reported that @entity0 had sent the letter , said it described a shared interest between the @entity12 and @entity4 in fighting @entity8 militants and stressed that any cooperation on that would be largely contingent on @entity4 agreeing to the nuclear deal			1
however , while not confirming nor denying the existence of the letter , administration officials said there were still no plans to cooperate or coordinate with @entity4 against the militants			1
‘ the @entity12 will not cooperate militarily with @entity4 in that effort , ’ @entity63 spokesman @entity62 said			1
‘ we wo n't share intelligence with them			2
’ diplomatic sources separately confirmed the existence of the letter to @entity70			2
they did so on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss @entity0 's outreach			0
@entity0 authorized a @entity12 - led air campaign against @entity8 fighters in @entity76 in august and expanded the mission the following month to neighboring @entity78			0
the @entity12 is taking action alongside several other nations , including a handful of regional partners			0
@entity4 is not part of the @entity12 coalition , but it has also been fighting the @entity85 on the ground			2
@entity0 's letter reportedly described a shared interest between the @entity12 and @entity4 in fighting @entity8 militants			1

@entity4 is a staunch supporter of @entity78 president @entity108 , who is a target of the militants and opposed by the @entity12 two chief critics of @entity0 's foreign policy , @entity114 sens. @entity113 of @entity115 and @entity116 of @entity117 , called it ‘ outrageous ’ that @entity0 would seek to enlist @entity4 in its fight against is given @entity4 's support for @entity108 and @entity121 extremists throughout the region			1
‘ the consequences of this ill - conceived bargain would destroy the @entity78 ' last , best chance to live in freedom from the brutal @entity108 regime , ’ the two senators said in a joint statement			0
house speaker @entity130 , asked in a separate briefing about the reported letter , said he did not trust @entity4 's leaders and did not think they should be brought into the fight against @entity8			0
@entity12 officials have not ruled out the possibility that a nuclear accord with @entity4 could open the door to discussions on other issues , but they have sought to keep the delicate negotiations focused solely on @entity101 's disputed nuclear program			1
the @entity12 and its negotiating partners say @entity4 is pursuing a bomb , while @entity4 says its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes			1
the prospects for a final agreement remain uncertain , with @entity0 saying on wednesday that the ability to secure a deal is an ‘ open question			0
’ @entity153 critics : @entity114 sens. @entity113 of @entity115 ( left ) and @entity116 of @entity117 ( right ) called it ‘ outrageous ’ that @entity0 would seek to enlist @entity4 in its fight against @entity85 the technical details of the talks have been closely guarded by the negotiating partners — the @entity12 , @entity159 , @entity160 , @entity161 , @entity162 , @entity163 and @entity4			2
the broad parameters of a potential agreement include @entity4 cutting back on its number of centrifuges enriching uranium and redesigning a planned heavy water reactor so it does n't produce plutonium			0
both materials can be used in nuclear warheads			0
in exchange , the @entity12 in particular would have to roll back some of the financial , trade and oil sanctions that significantly cut off @entity4 from global markets			2
the @entity12 and @entity4 broke off diplomatic relations in 1979 after the @entity85 revolution and the storming of the @entity181 in @entity101 , where 52 @entity12 were held hostage for more than a year			2
however , the relationship began to thaw after @entity0 took office , particularly following the election last year of a more moderate - sounding @entity4 president , @entity186			0
@entity12 and @entity4 officials held a series of secret meetings last year that ultimately paved the way for the resumption of international nuclear negotiations			1
@entity0 and @entity186 also held a historic phone call last fall , the first direct communication between their nation 's leaders since the @entity85 revolution			0
however , the two men have not spoken since and skipped the opportunity to meet face - to - face while attending @entity201 meetings in @entity202 in september			0
despite @entity186 's standing as president , @entity12 officials believe @entity2 , the powerful supreme leader , has the ultimate say in whether @entity4 reaches a nuclear deal with world powers .			1

news of the letter comes just weeks ahead of november 24 deadline in nuclear negotiations between the @entity12 and @entity4
the @entity63 has not confirmed the existence of the letter , but press secretary @entity62 said @entity12 wo n't cooperate militarily with @entity4
