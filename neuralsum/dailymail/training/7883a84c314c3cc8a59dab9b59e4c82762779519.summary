@entity1 majority leader @entity0 was dramatically defeated tuesday in a @entity4 @entity3 primary , crushed at the hands of a little - known economics professor – a stunning upset and the highest - profile scalp on the @entity10 's growing trophy wall			1
the seven - term congressman lost by a 55 - 44 margin to @entity13 , a political novice with little money , marking a huge victory for the same conservative insurgent movement that supported @entity0 just a few years ago			1

he is the first @entity28 in @entity30 history to lose his party 's primary			2
but that loss did n't come at the hands of a fellow @entity65			0
@entity4 law prohibits @entity0 from running as an independent once he has contested a party 's primary			1
he has told the @entity70 that he wo n't run as a write - in candidate , effectively ending his political career			2
the voters in @entity0 's very conservative congressional district spoke loud and clear , leading conservative activist @entity75 told reporters tuesday night			2
' @entity0 's loss tonight is an apocalyptic moment for the @entity3 establishment , ' @entity75 said			2
' the grassroots is in revolt and marching			0
' @entity13 , the @entity83 economics professor who unseated @entity1 majority leader @entity0 , has a lot more going for him than his policy visions			1
' total eye candy ' : brat is liked by his students brat 's students appreciate how he looks in a cardigan more than his approach to teaching and politics			2
his hotness rating on the site is a glowing red chili pepper - just a notch down from the site 's best rating of combusting chili pepper			2
' he 's so charming , ' wrote one , ' and really knows how to incorporate real world examples to keep the class exciting and relateable [ sic ]			0
' ' he change [ s ] assignments a lot and sometimes it 's unclear what he wants you to do			0
plus he 's total eye candy ! ! ' another said : ' brat changes assignments all the time , but he is so charming , you forget to be mad at him '			0
' not a great teacher , ' wrote another			0
' great guy , but almost too smart to teach			0
' a third seemed to mock his conservative street - cred : ' i was excited to take a class from a guy who promised to put a stop to immigrant " amnesty , " but at least 3 people in class were somewhat @entity126 - looking and he did not deport a single one of them all semester			2
also , requires purchase of 2 copies of " @entity130 " for some reason			0
' @entity75 is chairman of @entity75 , an organization that has targeted moderate @entity3 , including @entity0			0
@entity13 said after the race was called in his favor that his push to unseat @entity0 had found a receptive audience among voters who were weary of partisan bickering – and of infighting within the @entity3			1
' the @entity30 people want to pay attention to serious ideas again , ' he told a @entity144 audience			0
' our founding was built by people who were political philosophers and we need to get back to that , away from this kind of cheap political rhetoric of right and left			2
' brat added : ' @entity154 acted through people on my behalf			1
it ’s an unbelievable miracle			1
' most @entity3 pollsters and election consultants were genuinely stunned by the results on tuesday			0
one poll of 400 likely @entity3 primary voters conducted in late may for the @entity0 campaign and shared with the @entity165 showed the incumbent with an improbable 62 - 28 lead			1
the @entity169 opinion research firm said that its margin of error was + / - 4.9 percentage points , but it was off by 27			0
six hours before the polls closed , the venerable @entity165 predicted that @entity13 would ' fall far short			0
' ' disorganization and poor funding have stymied the campaign of tea party activist @entity177 , ' read the opening salvo of a premature political obituary , ' even as he tapped into conservative resentment toward a party leader who has been courting the @entity3 right for years			1
' @entity0 founded the @entity3 's ' @entity185 ' program along with 2012 vice presidential candidate @entity186 of @entity187 and @entity28 @entity188 of @entity189			2
they created the initiative in 2007 as a support system for a new generation of @entity3 candidates running for open congressional seats or trying to unseat @entity65 incumbents			0
but the program grew to take all comers after the @entity199 endorsed it – including challengers to sitting congressmen like @entity0 himself			0
brat had been a thorn in @entity0 's side on the campaign trail , casting the congressman as a @entity210 insider who is n't conservative enough			1
last month , a feisty crowd of brat supporters booed @entity0 in front of his family at a local party convention			2
@entity0 's fuzzy position on immigration reform became a focal point of the race when @entity13 attacked his rival for what he said was a full embrace of ' amnesty ' for illegal immigrants			1
' @entity0 believes that we need to import more low - wage foreign workers at the expense of lower wages and fewer jobs for @entity4 families , ' @entity13 told the @entity230 in an election survey that appeared in the paper on monday			1
' a vote for @entity0 is a vote for open borders and corporate handouts , ' brat continued			2
@entity0 has insisted that he opposes a quick path to citizenship for people living in the @entity30 illegally			2
but he said he could be open to limited programs , like one that would offer green cards to young people brought to the @entity30 by their parents , once they served a term in the military			0
he told the @entity230 in his own survey responses that he believes ' the immigration system is broken and we should make reforms in a step - by - step approach			0
' but , added @entity0 , ' i do not and will not accept the president ’s all - or - nothing approach			2
' he also rejected a comprehensive immigration reform bill – which tea partiers derided as a ' blanket amnesty ' program – that has passed in the @entity259 but stalled in the @entity1			1
pro-immigration activists seemed to relish the chance to leverage the issue against a powerful @entity3			0
twice in the last six months they protested against @entity0 in the lobby of his @entity265 , @entity4 condominium building			0
a jubilant group of amnesty advocates showed up to gloat at @entity0 's election - night headquarters following his concession speech			1
@entity270 , se puede : immigration reform activists crashed @entity0 's election - night party , jubilant about bouncing him from office -- but perhaps not thinking ahead to the tea partier brat 's likely win in a heavily @entity3 district the thrill is gone : @entity0 supporters could n't hide their shock and disappointment when election returns came in and the news got progressively worse brat 's message apparently scored well with voters in the 7th district , which includes part of @entity4 's capitol city @entity291			1
he prevailed by a double - digit margin			0
' there needs to be a change , ' said @entity295 , who voted in @entity296 tuesday			0
the engineering company employee said he has friends who tried to arrange town hall meetings with @entity0 , who declined their invitations			0
a major rift between the @entity3 's establishment wing and tea party factions has been a fixture in @entity4 since last year when @entity10 favorite @entity306 lost the governor 's race to former @entity310 chairman @entity309			1
@entity0 supporters responded by trying to wrest control of the state party away from conservatives with tea party leanings , including in the majority leader 's home district			1
but tuesday 's election result shows that the last laugh belongs to the ' @entity48 ' crowd			0
brat teaches economics at @entity83 , a small liberal arts school north of @entity291			1
he raised barely $ 200,000 for his campaign , according to the most recent financial disclosure reports			1
the @entity325 reported that @entity0 ’s campaign splashed out close to that amount just at steakhouses ( $ 168,637 )			1
@entity0 , by comparison , sat on a war chest of roughly $ 2 million			2
@entity331 reported that he spent $ 120,000 printing campaign mailers , $ 13,000 on yard signs , $ 370,000 on campaign ads and $ 30,000 on polling			1
prominent national conservative groups spent their own money to help @entity13 , who also offset his financial and name - recognition disadvantages with endorsements from conservative radio host @entity340 and other conservative activists			1
heir no more : @entity0 was considered the likely successor to house speaker @entity27 ( @entity343 ) , but instead his has become the highest - profile scalp on the @entity10 's wall ' he really just did n’t have very much money , but what he did have was a lot of heart , ' @entity340 told @entity325			1
' i think there will be a lot of people out there saying this could be the beginning of something really big for the @entity3			0
' brat will now advance to the general election , where he will face off against @entity59 nominee @entity359 , another professor at @entity83			1
within hours of the race 's conclusion , @entity359 's homespun campaign website was scrapped entirely , in favor or a flashier fundraising engine from @entity366 , a firm that boasts it has raised $ 515 million for @entity59 since 2004			1
@entity3 have represented @entity4 's 7th congressional district since 1971 and its residents have not voted to elect a @entity59 president for more than 20 years , giving brat a significant advantage in november			1
@entity0 , a former state legislator , was elected to @entity372 in 2000			0
he became the @entity3 ' majority leader in 2011 .			0

@entity0 lost the primary to @entity10 - backed economics professor @entity13
brat has no political experience and raised little money for his campaign ; he will now face a @entity59 candidate who teaches at the same *college*
brat 's campaign coffers barely scraped $ 200,000 whereas @entity0 spent $ 168,000 at steakhouses alone
@entity0 was often considered the heir - apparent to @entity27 as @entity1 speaker
the upset is seen by many as a significant victory for the tea party movement , which some had written off as past its sell - by date
brat appealed to conservatives ' fear that @entity0 would embrace an @entity401 - style ' amnesty ' push for illegal immigrants
after being declared the winner , @entity13 said : ' @entity154 acted through people on my behalf . it ’s an unbelievable miracle . '
just a few years ago , @entity0 was a @entity10 favorite , but his openness to changes in immigration policy left him *vulnerable*
in november brat will face @entity59 sociology professor @entity359
both men teach at @entity83 near @entity291
