researchers have claimed a major breakthrough in the fight against obesity - and say they have found a genetic switch that controls our metabolism			1
researchers have identified a protein that controls metabolism - and used it to dramatically reduce the development of obesity and diabetes in mice			1
by manipulating the biochemical process that underlies cells ' energy - burning abilities , researchers say they could now develop new weight loss therapies			1
by manipulating the biochemical process that underlies how we burn energy , researchers say they could now develop radical new weight loss therapies			1
the new findings show that reducing the amount of nicotinamide n - methyltransferase ( @entity27 ) protein in fat and liver dramatically reduces the development of obesity and diabetes in mice			1
@entity27 is known to process @entity33 and has been previously linked with certain types of cancers			1
the new process hinges on a biochemical mechanism known as a futile cycle , in which cellular reactions are sped up , thereby generating more energy			0
this is what allows some people to eat as much as they want , but never put on weight			0

' with this discovery , we now have a means of metabolic manipulation that could help speed energy production and lead to weight loss , ' said senior author @entity62			0
the new findings hinge on a biochemical mechanism known as a futile cycle , in which cellular reactions are sped up , thereby generating more energy			0
' we all know people who can seemingly eat whatever they want and not gain weight , ' explains @entity62			0
' part of the reason for this natural weight control owes to basal cellular metabolism â€“ the body 's inherent rate of burning energy			1
' a futile cycle is one way to speed up energy utilization in cells			1
' the breakthrough also used a technique already used to treat other diseases in humans , raising hopes it could be available soon			0
' our findings are particularly exciting because the antisense oligonucleotide [ @entity91 ] technology we used to inhibit the @entity27 gene in our study is already being used to treat other diseases in humans , ' said dr @entity62			2
the new findings hinge on a biochemical mechanism known as a futile cycle , in which cellular reactions are sped up , thereby generating more energy - and allows some people to eat as much as they want without getting fat			0
more than one - third of the @entity103 adult population is currently obese , according to the @entity104 ( @entity104 )			0
' obesity is a serious economic burden to our healthcare system and a major risk factor for developing insulin resistance and diabetes , ' says dr @entity62			0
@entity27 is an enzyme that processes vitamin b3 and has been linked to certain types of cancer , as well as alzheimer 's disease , said co-corresponding author @entity117 , @entity118 , phd , a @entity119 in the @entity62 laboratory at @entity46 and assistant professor of medicine at @entity122			2
' now we have identified an entirely new role for this enzyme in fat tissue , and that is to regulate energy metabolism , ' he said			1
the investigators first confirmed that levels of @entity27 were increased in obese and diabetic mice			2
' in a comparison of genetic profiles of fat from mice that were either prone to or protected from developing diabetes , we discovered that the animals that were prone to develop diabetes had a lot of @entity27 in the fat and liver , ' said @entity117			2
the team discovered that @entity27 inhibition speeds up the so called futile cycle , resulting in more dietary calories being burned for energy and fewer calories being incorporated into fat			1
importantly , notes @entity62 , the team used antisense oligonucleotide ( @entity91 ) technology to knock down the @entity27 gene			2
' because @entity151 have already been approved by the @entity152 [ @entity152 ] for the treatment of genetic causes of elevated cholesterol or hyperlipidemia , as well as the treatment of a viral eye infection , it 's possible that clinical trials to test an @entity91 anti-obesity therapy in humans could readily move forward			0
' @entity27 looks to be a promising target for future therapeutic development			2
' furthermore , because obesity is associated with an increased incidence of alzheimer 's disease and certain cancers , disease states in which @entity27 is also elevated , an @entity91 could potentially also be beneficial in managing these other devastating conditions			0
