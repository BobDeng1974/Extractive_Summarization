by @entity0 published : 00:54 est , 11 november 2013 updated : 09:22 est , 11 november 2013 @entity2 ' blunder : this is the advert featuring @entity5 clergyman @entity4 , a lifelong teetotaller who campaigned against alcohol executives at cider brand @entity2 have admitted that they blundered by advertising the drink with a picture of a teetotal @entity14 vicar who campaigned against alcohol			1
the @entity17 - based drinksmaker thought it had found a photograph of @entity19 , who gave his sons the money to start up the business 120 years ago			1
next to the black and white picture was the slogan : ' we hope he 'd be proud			2
' but the man in the picture , had he known what it was being used for , would almost certainly not have been proud			0
it turns out the photograph was of @entity4 , a @entity5 clergyman , who devoted his life to helping alcoholics			1
born in @entity36 in 1847 , @entity4 worked as a minister in various circuits , founding new churches wherever he went			1
he was the founder of the @entity40 and while superintendent of the @entity44 ( @entity43 ) circuit he launched the @entity45			0
that organisation which was behind the construction of many of the big city methodist missions that still stand today			0
the mistake was spotted after @entity51 , who own @entity2 , spent tens of thousands of pounds on the advertising campaign			1
but after the @entity55 ( @entity55 ) was told of the blunder the company scrapped the advertisements and posters			0
the gaffe comes after the watchdog dismissed a separate complaint relating to a television advert for @entity2 which one viewer said implied ' the success of a social occasion was always dependent on alcohol '			1
close to the wire : the gaffe came after the @entity55 dismissed another complaint against @entity2 for an advert which one viewer said implied ' the success of a social occasion was always dependent on alcohol ' the advert showed a night out in reverse , with a group of friends drinking @entity2 at various points during the evening and particularly the beginning			2
@entity79 : @entity4 was the founder of the @entity40 and the @entity45 , which built many @entity5 missions a voiceover said : ' we do n’t have a master plan , so we do n’t know where the night will take us			2
but one thing is certain			0
it will begin with a @entity2			2
' the @entity87 reported the @entity55 as saying : ' while we considered it was clear that the characters in the ad intended to drink alcohol , we noted the product was shown on only a few occasions and that the characters did not appear to behave as though they had consumed alcohol irresponsibly			0
' we considered the ad did not imply the success of the social occasions was dependent on the consumption of alcohol and therefore concluded that it did not breach the code			0
' a company spokesman said of the latest adverts : ' we fully appreciated the distress caused by using the wrong image			0
' @entity51 are making a donation to the church in @entity109 , @entity110 , where @entity111 was the minister in 1870s .			1
