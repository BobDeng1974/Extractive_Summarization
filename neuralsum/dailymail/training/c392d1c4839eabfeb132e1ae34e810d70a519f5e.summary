urine , feces and pools vomit everywhere : that 's what a family in @entity4 , @entity5 , found all over their house when they returned home from a vacation in @entity11 last month - and they can thank teenagers from some of the areas most elite schools			2
it turns out that the 17 - year - old girl the family had hired to watch their cats threw a party at @entity23 's house and invited teens from all over the @entity4 area to partake in destroying the home the family has spent 20 years fixing up			1
when @entity23 asked the teen 's parents to pay for the damages , they offered him $ 90 , which would n't even begin to cover the thousands of dollars worth of damage done to the house , the jewelry that was stolen , or the $ 6,000 in cash that was taken from the house			1
destroyed : teens did thousands of dollars of damage to the home of @entity23 and his wife , @entity41 when @entity23 and his family walked in the door , they found the mother of the cat - sitter standing in their foyer next to a vacuum cleaner			1
she explained that there was a problem with one of the beds and that she had taken the liberty of taking a comforter and two rugs to a professional cleaner			0
but @entity58 - still confused as to why there was thousands of dollars in damage to his home , as well as urine and vomit everywhere - wanted to know what caused all of the damage			1
' what the hell happened ? ' he asked the girl 's mother			0
what had happened was that the 17 - year - old cat - sitter , who the family describes as a ' trusted friend ' of their daughter , invited roughly 50 teenagers from many of the area 's elite private schools - with names like @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 - and they destroyed the house			1
as if the urine feces and vomit was n't bad enough , @entity23 tells the @entity88 that he also found used condoms scattered throughout the house			2
as if the damage was n't bad enough , video of the teens destroying the house started popping up on social media websites			2
gross : the homeowners found urine , feces and vomit all over their house in one of the videos , a male was seen urinating on 18 - year - old @entity104 's bed - as another teen is narrating , saying ' this is for you			2
' ' the destruction to our house is considerable			0
there was human feces , urine and vomit in numerous locations			0
every floor in the house was rifled			0
there was broken furniture and there were multiple used condoms , ” @entity23 told the paper , as he and his wife explained that it was n't until last week that the stench from the december 27 party was finally gone			0
' it took an industrial strength cleaning to get rid of the odors of urine and vomit , and we keep discovering more , ' @entity23 said			0
' i do n’t know that i wo n’t open a box in my attic at some point and discover more vomit			0
' according to @entity23 , the cats the 17 - year - old was supposed to be watching were so traumatized by what went on during the party ' that they did not come out of their hiding places until two days after we had come home			2
' authorities have been given a list of the names of at least 46 people who were at the party as they begin to investigate the role the cat - sitter played in throwing the party			1
authorities say that twenty - five of the teens involved in destroying the house attended @entity82 , seven were from @entity83 , six from @entity154 , four from @entity84 - which charges fees of $ 10,000 a year - three from a @entity157 high school and one was an exchange student			1
elite : the majority of teens who destroyed the home went to elite private schools like @entity84 the identity of the 17 - year - old cat - sitter has not been made public			1
in addition to the video of a teenager urinating on @entity58 's bed , authorities found other social media entries they believe are in reference to the party : ' if i did n’t die last night , i ’m probably living forever			2
' ' i am disgusted by every aspect of this night			0
' ' never realized that i go to school with such horny people			0
' ' roll another bowl			0
' @entity23 says he and his wife met with the parents of the cat - sitter			1
he says they asked them to reimburse the $ 8,500 they spent on their vacation as partial restitution for the damage done to their home			0
the girls ' parents , however , gave them a check for $ 90 - the amount they 'd paid the girl to watch their cats			1
if no criminal charges are filed , @entity58 will likely sue the parents of the cat - sitter in civil court .			1

@entity23 says the teens also stole thousands of dollars worth of jewelry and $ 6,000 in cash
the parents of the girl who threw the party are *refusing* to pay for the damage caused by their daughter and her friends
the cat - sitter 's parents wrote @entity58 a check for $ 90
authorities say nearly 50 people were involved in destroying @entity23 's house
