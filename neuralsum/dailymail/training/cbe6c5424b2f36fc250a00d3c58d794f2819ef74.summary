world number one @entity1 erased any concerns about her worrying left knee with a 6 - 4 6 - 4 win over @entity5 at the @entity6 on monday that featured two eye - popping demonstrations of her flexibility			1
never one to do things by half , @entity1 provided a startling exhibition of just how much her troublesome knee has improved since she pulled out of two events in @entity14			1
@entity1 ' stellar performance in the match may have been helped on by recent negative comments from @entity19 president @entity18 , who called the number one ranked player and her sister @entity22 the ' @entity1 brothers ' and ' scary to look at ' during an appearance on a @entity26 tv show this month			1
at a press conference in @entity29 on sunday , the younger @entity1 sister thanks the @entity30 for its swift response to the comments , suspending @entity18 for a year and ordering him to pay a $ 25,000 fine			1
i thought they were in a way bullying			2
' on the court in @entity29 on monday , @entity1 was tentative to start but quickly got her stride			1
@entity54 through the first set , she sprinted so hard to try and chase down a forehand from @entity5 that she ended up doing the splits			1
the crowd gasped in wonder as she bounced back up to her feet like an @entity61 gymnast			2
then she did the splits again in the second set , showing she has the elasticity to compliment her renowned power			0
' i do work on my flexibility , but not for tennis , because i dance , ' she later told a news conference			1
' i guess it comes in handy			0
like knocking two birds out with one stone			0
' her acrobatic display was enough to alleviate any concerns about her prospects of winning the @entity30 's lucrative championship for a third straight year			0
unacceptable : @entity1 recently called out @entity26 tennis coach @entity18 ( pictured ) for his racist remarks against her and her sister @entity22 ' @entity1 brothers ' : @entity18 appeared on a @entity26 tv show and talked about how ' scary ' the @entity83 sisters look , calling them the ' @entity84 ' instead			1
the tennis pro sisters pictured above playing doubles in april 2013 a few weeks ago , her chances of winning looked slim after she first quit the @entity89 because of illness then the @entity91 with a knee complaint			2
the world number one only resumed training last week , restricting her practice to reduce any risk of aggravating the injury but showed no lingering effects against the lightning - fast @entity5 , thumping down a dozen aces in her opening match			1
' i did n't have any fear at all			0
i felt pretty good , ' said @entity1			2
' i felt the knee a little bit , but compared to what it was in @entity108 , it feels so much better			0
' i 'm getting better , which is great			0
just have to keep doing my program so by the end of the week , hopefully - if i 'm here - i 'll still be getting better			2
' number one : @entity1 was confident and happy at monday 's game in @entity29 if @entity1 had any health concerns after the match , it was with her voice , not her knee			1
after blowing a 4 - 1 lead in the opening set and allowing @entity5 to get back to 4 - 4 , her relief at taking the set was clearly visible			1
she clenched her fist and yelled ' c'mon ' -- and repeated the gesture so many times before the end that she finished with a croaky throat			0
' it 's definitely all reflex			0
i never do it on purpose , ' @entity1 said			2
' i felt like my energy got a little low , and then i just tried to do everything i could to bring my energy level up or just to fight			0
' because if i 'm not playing well , i have to rely on other things			0
so then i think at that point , that 's when the match really turned and got super intense			0

the number one ranked played beat @entity5 , of @entity36 , 6 - 4 6 - 4
@entity143 comes one day after @entity1 held a press conference to address negative comments made by @entity26 tennis chief @entity18
@entity18 called @entity1 and her sister @entity22 the ' @entity1 brothers ' and ' scary to look at '
