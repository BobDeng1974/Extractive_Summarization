by @entity0 published : 11:20 est , 15 november 2013 @entity2 : 14:57 est , 15 november 2013 underwater kites that bear an uncanny resemblance to the @entity7 could soon be supplying power to homes across the world , an @entity4 researcher claims			1
@entity11 of @entity12 says underwater currents could produce power comparable to multiple nuclear stations - if engineers can work out how to harness it			1
his idea is to use large kites with rigid wings underwater			1
minesto an energy firm is experimenting with the technology			0
the tidal energy device developed by @entity24 , named @entity25 , converts energy from tidal stream flows into electricity using a kite with a turbine by flying the kites in a figure of eight pattern , professor @entity11 believes he can harness large amounts of power			1
the futuristic devices look like the fictional spaceship in @entity38 but could play a part in providing much needed energy to the world 's growing population			1
professor @entity11 sits on a rig that uses a rocking arm to translate the motion of wind - powered kite into rotary motion to spin an electric generator ' unseen under the waves , winding along coastlines and streaming through underwater channels , there are countless ocean currents and tidal flows that bristle with kinetic energy , ' he said			1
' and just as wind turbines can convert moving air into electricity , there is the potential to transform these virtually untapped liquid ' breezes ' into vast amounts of power			2
' for example , it has been estimated that the potential power from the @entity70 , which flows from the @entity71 into the @entity72 , is 20 gigawatts — equivalent to about 10 nuclear power plants			2
' the project has recently been given a three - year , $ 300,000 grant from the @entity76 ( @entity76 ) to explore ways to harness ocean currents and tidal flows			0
the underwater kites bear some resemblance to the @entity7 , seen here in an illustration for the recent @entity38 film , into the darkness as water flows over the hydrodynamic wing , a lift force is generated which allows the device to move smoothly through the water and for the turbine to rotate hence generating electricity the team plan to build a series of kites and test them in ‘ water tunnels ’			1
energy from a tidal stream is converted into electricity using a kite with a turbine			0
the kite assembly , consisting of a wing and turbine , is attached by a tether to a fixed point on the ocean bed			0
as water flows over the hydrodynamic wing , a lift force is generated which allows the device to move smoothly through the water and for the turbine to rotate hence generating electricity			0
dr @entity11 of @entity114 : ' it has been estimated that the potential power from the @entity70 , which flows from the @entity71 into the @entity72 , is 20 gigawatts — equivalent to about 10 nuclear power plants			1
' ' instead of moving air , you have moving water and the kites have rigid wings , ' @entity11 said , ' but the same physical principles apply			2
' one way to generate power with underwater kites is to have an electric generator attached to the kite , which would be tethered to a floating platform			2
using computational models , @entity11 and his team will virtually test possible designs for undersea kites and explore methods for tethering them to floating platforms similar to those used for oil and gas rigs			2
in the final stage of the research , they will build scale models of the kites and test them in a water tank at @entity12 and at the @entity144 , a renowned hydraulics research facility where the kites will be'flown ' in large water flumes			1
another firm , @entity24 , is also experimenting with the technology			0
the tidal energy device developed by @entity24 , named @entity25 , converts energy from tidal stream flows into electricity using a kite with a turbine			0
' the kite assembly , consisting of a wing and turbine , is attached by a tether to a fixed point on the ocean bed , ' the firm says			0
professor @entity11 's kite is connected by a tether to a platform that floats at the ocean surface and is anchored to the ocean floor with mooring lines			1
the kite will have a wing , a rudder control surfaces , and ballast tanks			0
a turbine generator inside the kite would generate power as the kite moved in a figure - eight motion ' as water flows over the hydrodynamic wing , a lift force is generated which allows the device to move smoothly through the water and for the turbine to rotate hence generating electricity			0
” the @entity25 ‘ underwater kite ’ marine power plant is already producing electricity in the waters off @entity188 .			0
