by @entity0 for @entity1 a @entity3 - born man and his wife have been told by authorities in @entity6 they will not renew their 10 - year - old daughter 's passport on the grounds that she is called @entity10 – which is not on a government approved list of names			1
@entity14 and his @entity6 wife @entity15 are appealing against the @entity17 's decision , which also does not recognise the name of @entity10 's 12 - year - old brother @entity19 either			1
the couple , from @entity21 , have for years travelled with their children using passports featuring the names ' girl ' and ' boy ' because neither of their names are recognised by the country 's strict list of permissible names			2
a @entity3 - born man and his wife have been told by authorities in @entity6 they will not renew their 10 - year - old daughter 's passport on the grounds that she is called @entity10 – which is not on a government approved list of names but when they came to renew @entity10 's passport ahead of a planned family holiday to @entity43 , authorities decided to enforce a law banning the issue of any official document to people who do not have an ' approved @entity6 name '			1

this means in @entity6 , which has a population of 320,000 , you are allowed to name your baby @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 or @entity85 , but not @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 or @entity90			2
although the law has become more relaxed in recent years choices such as @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 , and @entity96 have been rejected outright because the letter ' c ' is not part of @entity6 's 32 - letter alphabet			1
for the 5,000 or so children born in @entity6 each year , the committee reportedly receives about 100 applications and rejects about half			2
@entity10 was rejected on the grounds that ' it ca n't be conjugated in @entity6 , ' said according to mr @entity14			2

but @entity136 eventually ruled that it could indeed be a feminine name			0
' finally i 'll have the name @entity125 in my passport , ' she said after the ruling			0
the @entity55 family have now successfully applied for an emergency @entity3 passport from the @entity3 embassy			0
