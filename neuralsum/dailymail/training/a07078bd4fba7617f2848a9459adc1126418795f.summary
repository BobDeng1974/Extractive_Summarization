@entity0 has halted sales of its controversial @entity3 wearable computer - but promises new versions are coming			1
the troubled product has failed to fire the public 's imagination , with wearers dubbed ' glassholes ' and even many @entity0 employees abandoning them			1
the company insists it is still committed to launching the smart glasses as a consumer product , but will stop producing @entity3 in its present form , according to the @entity15			1
the @entity23 programme , gave software developers the chance to buy @entity3 for $ 1,500 ( £ 990 ) , and was launched in the @entity26 in 2013 , and the @entity27 last summer			1
from next week , the search firm will stop taking orders for the product but it says it will continue to support companies that are using @entity3			1
the firm had already been thought to be developing a new version with chips made by @entity20 to go on sale later this year			2
the glass team is also expected to now move out of the @entity37 which engages in ' blue sky ' research , and become a separate undertaking , under its current manager @entity41			1
she and the @entity17 team will report to @entity44 , the chief executive of the home automation business nest , acquired by @entity0 a year ago , the @entity15 says			1
he said the project had ' broken ground and allowed us to learn what 's important to consumers and enterprises alike ' and he was excited to be working with the team ' to integrate those learnings into future products '			1
@entity0 says it is committed to working on the future of the product , but gave no timescale for the launch of an improved product			1
' it ’s hard to believe that @entity3 started as little more than a scuba mask attached to a laptop , ' the @entity17 team said in a post on @entity64			2
' we kept on it , and when it started to come together , we began the @entity68 as a kind of “ open beta ” to hear what people had to say			2
' ' @entity3 was in its infancy , and you took those very first steps and taught us how to walk			2
' well , we still have some work to do , but now we ’re ready to put on our big kid shoes and learn how to run			2
' where 's the @entity3 ? @entity80 was spotted without @entity0 's specs at a @entity83 red - carpet event last yeat			1
since they were unveiled , he has rarely been seen without them			2
' since we first met , interest in wearables has exploded and today it ’s one of the most exciting areas in technology			2
' as we look to the road ahead , we realize that we ’ve outgrown the lab and so we ’re officially “ graduating ” from @entity0 [ x ] to be our own team here at @entity0			1
we ’re thrilled to be moving even more from concept to reality			0
' as part of this transition , we ’re closing the @entity68 so we can focus on what ’s coming next			0
' in the meantime , we ’re continuing to build for the future , and you ’ll start to see future versions of @entity3 when they ’re ready			0
( for now , no peeking			0
) according to the report , @entity3 will switch from its dead @entity108 chip to a processor built by @entity20 and will get a full hardware refresh			0
recently it emerged that the consumer version , which @entity0 promised would go on sale this year , has now been delayed until 2015 - raising questions over its future			1
late last year , of 16 @entity3 app makers contacted by @entity118 , nine said that they had stopped work on their projects or abandoned them , mostly because of the lack of customers or limitations of the device			0
three more have switched to developing for business , leaving behind consumer projects			2
however , plenty of larger developers remain with @entity3			0
the nearly 100 apps on the official web site include @entity133 and @entity134 , although one major player recently defected : @entity136			0
@entity0 founder @entity80 ( @entity137 ) and designer @entity138 sit and watch the rehearsal for her @entity141 collection show during @entity142 , where new @entity3 frameswere launched in a bid to make them more appealing			1
@entity3 was the first project to emerge from @entity0 's x division , the secretive group tasked with developing ' moonshot'products such as self - driving cars			1
glass and wearable devices overall amount to a new technology , as smartphones once were , that will likely take time to evolve into a product that clickswith consumers			2
' if there was 200 million @entity3 sold , it would be a different perspective , ' said @entity162 , the chief executive of @entity164 , which put development of a @entity3 game on hold this year and is looking at other platforms , including the @entity133 - owned virtual - reality goggles @entity171			0
' there 's no market at this point , ' several key @entity0 employees instrumental to developing @entity3 have left the company in the last six months , including lead developer @entity177 , electrical engineering chief @entity178 , and @entity179 , director of developer relations			1
and a glass funding consortium created by @entity183 and two of @entity83 's biggest venture capitalists , @entity180 and @entity181 , quietly deleted its website , routing users to the main @entity17 site			2
@entity0 insists it is committed to @entity3 , with hundreds of engineers and executives working on it , as well as new fashionista boss @entity41 , a former @entity191 executive			1
' we are completely energized and as energized as ever about the opportunity that wearables and @entity3 in particular represent , ' said @entity195 of business operations @entity196			0
' we are as committed as ever to a consumer launch			1
' that is going to take time and we are not going to launch this product until it 's absolutely ready , ' @entity196 said			1
after an initial burst of enthusiasm , signs that consumers are giving up on @entity3 have been @entity206 developers recently have felt unsupported by investorsand , at times , @entity0 itself			1
@entity80 had predicted a launch this year , but 2015 is now the most likely date , a person familiar with the matter said			0
after an initial burst of enthusiasm , signs that consumers are giving up on @entity3 have been building			0
some developers recently have felt unsupported by investors and , at times , @entity0 itself			1
the @entity222 , the funding consortium co-run by @entity183 , invested in only three or four small start - ups by the beginning of this year , a person familiar with the statistics said			0
a @entity183 spokeswoman declined to comment on the number of investments and said the web site was closed for simplicity			0
' we just found it 's easier for entrepreneurs to come to us directly , ' she said			2
the lack of a launch date has given some developers the impression that @entity0 still treats @entity3 as an experiment			1
@entity0 dubbed the first set of several thousand @entity17 users as ' explorers			1
' but as the @entity240 hit the streets , they drew stares and jokes			0
some people viewed the device , capable of surreptitious video recording , as an obnoxious privacy intrusion , deriding the once - proud explorers as ' @entity250			0
' ' it looks super nerdy , ' said @entity252 , a @entity253 - based consultant , whose @entity3 now gathers dust in a drawer			0
' i 'm a card carrying nerd , but this was one card too many			0
' @entity3 now sells on @entity260 for as little as half list price			0
' it 's not a big enough platform to play on seriously , ' said @entity264 , founder of @entity266 - based software firm @entity265 , which put on hold a @entity3 app for logging exercise and biking			1
mobile game company @entity270 , known for its popular ' @entity271 : @entity273 ' title , was one of the first to launch a game on @entity3			0
@entity278 , a puzzler released a year ago , is still available , but @entity270 has discontinued work on it , a spokesman for the company said			0
another developer , @entity282 , won $ 10,000 in a contest last year for creating an aliens - themed video game for @entity3 , @entity286 , but @entity0 never put it on the official hub for glass apps , making it tougher to find			1
he has quit working on updates			0
still , there are some enthusiastic developers			0
cycling and running app @entity294 finds @entity3 well - suited for its users , who want real - time data on their workouts , said @entity300 , vice president of business development			0
and entrepreneur @entity301 said it is ideal for his company , @entity303 , which detects if people are falling asleep at the wheel			0
in april , @entity0 launched the @entity307 program to help make the device useful for specific industries , such as healthcare and manufacturing			1
so far the effort has resulted in apps that are being tested or used at companies such as @entity315 and @entity317 ' @entity316			0
@entity0 is selling @entity3 in bulk to some businesses , offering two - for - one discounts .			2
