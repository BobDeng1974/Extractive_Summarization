by @entity0 published : 15:55 est , 9 october 2013 updated : 16:45 est , 9 october 2013 @entity1 is widely known the founder of @entity3 but a new book has revealed that it was his friend that he later pushed out of the company who helped take @entity1 's germ of an idea and turn it into a reality			1
@entity1 was n't even the one who came up with the name of the social media site , and it was his friend @entity15 who should be credited with the moniker			1
@entity15 reportedly spent days flipping through a dictionary looking for inspiration before making a mental connection between the vibration of a phone , to a twitch , to twitter			0
the story of how @entity15 helped develop the new status - updating service and taking ownership of the idea before @entity1 allegedly made a power play and got their third partner - @entity31 - to fire him is all detailed in a @entity34 preview of an upcoming book , called @entity3			1
plotting : a new book tells how @entity1 ( seen here in september ) pushed his friend and @entity3 co-founder @entity15 out of the company because he felt threatened ' i was not in the story , which in some ways was difficult to deal with in the beginning , since it was a massive labor of love and a massive labor to get it created , ' @entity15 told @entity47 in an exclusive interview			1
' to create the thing , to bring it into the world			0
it was a ton of effort and a ton of energy			0
man left behind : @entity15 was part of the team that came up with @entity3 but then ousted from the company the ' he said , he said ' account of who really came up with the idea adds @entity3 to the growing list of boldfaced company names whose creation is plagued by ego trips and pr moves			1
@entity1 was a 29 - year - old college dropout who could n't get a job as a shoe salesman when he sent @entity31 his resume to see if he had a job for him			2
@entity31 was four years older than @entity1 and made a name for himself in @entity73 by selling @entity74 to @entity75 for millions of dollars			2
at the time , @entity31 and his neighbor and fellow college dropout @entity15 were running a new company called @entity79 that was focusing on producing podcasts			1
author @entity81 tells how @entity79 was floundering because their service was made slightly irrelevant once @entity84 began streaming podcasts , so they began turning to their engineers and other employees for new possible ventures			0
@entity1 and @entity31 , who were good friends both in and out of the office , reportedly started talking seriously about the idea for a status - updating site after a night of heavy drinking			1
' there was a moment when i was sitting with @entity1 and i said , " oh , i do see how this could really come together to make something really compelling			0
" we were sitting on @entity102 in the car in the rain			0
we were going out and i was dropping him off and having this conversation			0
there was a moment where it all fit together for me , ' @entity15 said			0
the late night conversation in 2006 turned into a reality and @entity31 got on board , involving the board of @entity79 and pursuing a number of venture capital funders			0
big name : @entity1 originally approached @entity31 ( pictured ) about getting a job at the old company he used to run with glass called @entity79			1
@entity31 was famous in the tech world at that point for selling @entity74 to @entity75 for millions public face : @entity1 has made a concerted effort to portray himself as the sole founder of the company and accepts many interview opportunities as they are a chance to brand himself and the company the lengthy book excerpt tells how there were growing pains throughout the multi-year formation leading right up to the recent announcement that they are looking for a billion dollar ipo launch			1
one of the biggest problems that hindered their rapid growth was @entity1 's lack of management skills			2
he allegedly regularly left the office by 6pm to make it in time for hot yoga lessons and a fashion design course that he was taking at a local school			1
@entity31 eventually sat him down and gave him an ultimatum : ' you can either be a dressmaker or the @entity149 of @entity3 , but you ca nâ€™t be both			2
' much like @entity151 before him who was ousted from @entity152 before re-joining the company , @entity1 was asked to leave so that @entity31 , who was a stronger manager , could become ceo			1
@entity1 did n't take the news well and spoke to @entity157 founder @entity156 about coming to work for the competing social media giant			2
makeover : @entity1 used to have a nose ring but changed his look once being appointed ceo in the end , there was no clear role for @entity1 , though @entity157 was happy to bring him on board and iron out the details later			0
@entity1 ended up leaving that be and creating his mobile payment program , @entity170			0
@entity1 later re-joined @entity3 and is largely seen as the public face of the company - much to his own credit as he has given plenty of interviews telling about how he came up with the idea for the massive company			1
' while @entity1 had the germ of the idea , without the collaboration of the people who worked at @entity79 , that idea would have remained just an idea , ' @entity81 writes			0
@entity1 never mentioned @entity15 in interviews and @entity15 ' stock holdings means that he will likely only make the same amount as @entity1 's secretary made through @entity170			1
by comparison , @entity1 stands to make $ 2billion , and @entity31 could bring home $ 8billion			2
' i have n't spoken with him in 5 years			0
he has his own ideas about how life works , ' @entity15 told @entity47 .			0

@entity1 is largely seen as the founder of @entity3 but a new book tells about how he came up with the idea with a friend
that friend , @entity15 , was the one to come up with the name ' @entity3 '
@entity1 had no management experience and his partner @entity31 told him to stop leaving work to take fashion design classes
now @entity15 will make a percentage of what @entity1 and @entity31 will make once @entity3 's ipo is set and the company goes public
