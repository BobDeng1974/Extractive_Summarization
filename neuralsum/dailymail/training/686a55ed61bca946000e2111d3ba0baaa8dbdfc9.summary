by @entity0 @entity1 : 19:56 est , 22 december 2013 @entity2 : 05:46 est , 23 december 2013 @entity3 called him stupid for suggesting pupils need n’t bother at school			1
now @entity7 has thrown the same insult back at the @entity9 , claiming he failed to see he was making a ‘ positive ’ statement about giving people without qualifications a chance			1
the music mogul said his shows such as @entity16 demonstrate that you can be successful without getting good grades or going to university , and called mr @entity3 ’s response ‘ unbelievable ’			1
trading blows : music mogul @entity7 ( left ) has claimed education secretary @entity3 ( right ) failed to see he was making a ' positive ' statement about giving people without qualifications a chance he said : ‘ he did n’t bother to call , he did n’t want to hear my side of the story and , stupidly , he did n’t see the positive side of what i was trying to say which is that not everybody who leaves school is going to get great qualifications , or maybe they just do n’t have that kind of brain			1
‘ but , that does n’t mean that they should be ruled out , or not given a chance ... so , if anything , i thought he was irresponsible , because he was basically saying , if you ’re not qualified we ’re not going to back you , and it ’s like , how crazy are you for saying that ? ’ the row began last month when @entity7 , 54 , who is worth more than £ 200million from his record labels and hit shows such as @entity16 , said he was ‘ useless ’ at school but claimed it did not matter			1
he attended private @entity50 in @entity51 and then @entity52 and reportedly left with two ‘ @entity53			0
his father helped him find a post in the mail room at the record company @entity57 , where he went on to sign successful bands such as five and @entity60 before launching the x factor in 2004 with his own production company @entity62			2
in an interview with a @entity65 radio station he said : ‘ i did n’t work hard when i was at school			0
i left at 16 and i did n’t have any qualifications			0
the secret is to be useless at school and then get lucky			1
’ praise : @entity7 ( right ) said @entity71 ( left ) is an example of someone who has been given a chance , having had ' doors slammed in their faces ' the @entity9 responded angrily , saying @entity7 should use his fame to champion hard work at school ‘ not rubbish it ’			1
he said : ‘ this is an irresponsible and stupid thing to say			0
‘ teachers strive every day to ensure children understand the importance of learning , hard work and discipline			0
@entity7 ’s comments undermine their efforts			1
' stupidly , he did n’t see the positive side of what i was trying to say which is that not everybody who leaves school is going to get great qualifications , or maybe they just do n’t have that kind of brain ' @entity7 ‘ the truth is that only a tiny fraction of people get lucky			1
for everybody else , it ’s all about hard work and that starts with hard work at school			0
celebrities like mr @entity7 should encourage education , not rubbish it			2
’ programmes such as @entity16 and @entity110 ’s @entity109 have been attacked by politicians for leading a generation of children to believe fame and fortune comes easily			2
but @entity7 , who is shortly expecting his first child with girlfriend @entity117 , said yesterday that he had been ‘ kidding around ’ and ‘ not trying to make some kind of political statement			2
’ speaking on @entity121 radio station @entity120 , he added : ‘ i do n’t run a company where i hire people based on their qualifications , or have they gone to university			0
we hire people from the age of 16 up , 17 , whatever it is , who want to work hard and want to make a career for themselves			0
’ he added : ‘ look , i never made these shows to make statements , but i think the one thing i can say about shows like the @entity16 and @entity109 , is that even though people knock them , it is actually giving people a shot who ’ve had doors slammed in their faces			2
criticism : programmes such as @entity16 ( pictured ) and @entity110 's @entity109 have been attacked by politicians for leading a generation of children to believe fame and fortune comes easily ‘ and , @entity71 i think is a good example of that			1
i mean the idea that @entity71 at 47 could have got a record deal , the odds would have been 10billion - to - one she would n’t			0
so , the show was the only platform for her , and she ’s gone on to sell something like 30million records			0
' the truth is that only a tiny fraction of people get lucky			0
for everybody else , it ’s all about hard work and that starts with hard work at school			0
celebrities like mr @entity7 should encourage education , not rubbish it ' education secretary @entity3 ‘ i ’ve always been someone who slightly backs the underdog a little bit , that goes back to that point i just made about qualifications , and on the show , i kind of like those moments when someone like that gets supported by the public and goes on to do well			1
’ @entity178 mp @entity177 , a member of the @entity179 , said after @entity7 ’s original comments : ‘ for every @entity7 and brilliant entrepreneur like @entity183 who leave school without qualifications , there are hundreds or thousands of young people who are not achieving good @entity188 and @entity189 who are condemning themselves to a life of low aspirations and low wages			1
‘ @entity16 has already sent the wrong message to many young people that it is all too easy to get rich quick on the back of couple of hours ’ worth of performance			2
‘ the reality of life is that careers take years of graft and that includes having a strong education , particularly for those from deprived backgrounds			0

@entity7 says @entity16 proves you can be successful without good grades
54 - year - old music mogul called @entity3 's response ' unbelievable '
@entity214 began when @entity7 said it did *n't* matter he was ' useless ' at school
