@entity1 confirm they rejected @entity3 's approach to talk to @entity4 @entity4 insists he is happy managing the @entity6 club @entity3 are in the search for a new manager after @entity9 rules himself out @entity1 have kicked out an approach from @entity3 for their manager @entity4			1
the @entity13 strugglers only escaped relegation on the last day of the season after @entity9 ’s uninspiring spell in caretaker charge of the club			1
the former @entity20 skipper this week all but ruled himself out of the running to get the job on a permanent basis and yesterday @entity3 turned their sights on the highly - rated @entity4			1
making his point : @entity4 expressed his deire to stay at @entity1 despite @entity3 's interest @entity1 moved quickly to reject their advances and a club statement read : ‘ @entity1 confirms it has denied @entity3 permission to speak to manager @entity4			1
‘ the manager has been kept aware of the situation and declared that he is fully committed to the @entity33 and very happy to remain at @entity1 for the foreseeable future			1
@entity33 will make no further comment on this matter			2
’ insisting he is happy where he is , @entity4 added : ‘ while flattered at the interest shown , i am very happy at @entity1 and wish to continue the job and build upon the foundations laid down over the last 18 months or so			1
‘ i view the approach as a positive endorsement of all the hard work undertaken by everyone at the @entity33 in that period and have no plans to leave			2
feeling the strain : @entity9 has all but ruled himself out of the @entity3 job after a poor season ‘ all of my focus is on the forthcoming @entity51 final and preparations for the new season ahead			1
’ @entity4 replaced @entity54 at @entity6 18 months ago after leaving @entity55			1
he is widely credited with developing youngsters such as @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity60 and is seen as one of the country ’s most promising managerial talents			0
indeed @entity6 defender @entity64 expressed surprise yesterday that @entity4 had failed to feature prominently on manager of the year shortlists			1
promoting thursday ’s tsb under - 18s senior shield final at @entity69 between @entity70 of @entity71 and @entity72 , @entity64 said : ‘ i was surprised he was n’t nominated for @entity73			0
i think they name it a bit too soon			0
he has come in to @entity1 at a time when it was a real test for him			1
‘ the wage bill had been cut and he had a lot of players to shift			0
he gave a lot of young players their chance			0
maybe other managers would have put them in for one or two games , then brought them back out , but he had the confidence to stick with them			0
‘ the football @entity90 encourages @entity1 to play has been a breath of fresh air for @entity94 football			2
it is fitting for him to be in the cup final this season , especially going back to @entity98			0
’ young gun : @entity4 has been credited with developing the talents of @entity57 ( left ) at @entity6 @entity101 has learned that @entity59 and @entity60 were watched once again by @entity102 in tuesday ’s 3 - 1 defeat to @entity104			1
and @entity64 fears the forthcoming final could be a @entity1 swansong for some of his young team - mates			2
‘ of course it would be good for our young boys to stay at @entity1			2
but it can be really difficult for clubs to knock back serious offers , ’ he said			0
‘ as soon as a big offer comes in it ’s hard for chairmen to knock it back and say they want to keep their best young players for at least another year			0
omission : @entity64 ( centre ) is surprised @entity4 was n't nominated for the @entity73 award ‘ from a chairman ’s perspective , who ’s to say these boys are n’t a flash in the pan , that they go off the boil and they are out of the team the following year ? ‘ so it ’s a touchy subject			2
‘ it would be good for them to stay for their teams , the leagues and their education			0
‘ but it ’s very difficult when money gets offered and contracts get put in front of young guys that are three or four times their wages			0
it ’s hard to knock back			0
