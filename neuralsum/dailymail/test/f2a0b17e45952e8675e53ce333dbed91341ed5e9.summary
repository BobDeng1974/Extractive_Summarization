@entity32 , prosecuting , said that as an @entity1 , @entity1 could claim expenses , including a @entity34 , or @entity35 , to help fund his work			2
mr @entity32 said : ‘ what the prosecution say happened between 2004 and 2009 , when mr @entity1 ceased to be an @entity1 , is that he abused that allowance by submitting false claims for payment for work which he said to the @entity9 had been done by organisations working on his behalf			1
’ jurors heard that two of the organisations had previously campaigned against @entity27 membership of the @entity50			0
they were the @entity51 ( @entity52 ) , and @entity53 ( @entity54 )			0
however , it is alleged that neither of these companies conducted any work for @entity1 , who made claims of £ 16,000 against @entity60 , and £ 54,000 to @entity54			2
‘ they were simply used as a front to perpetrate , carry out fraud and to receive monies from the @entity9 , ’ said mr @entity32			0
@entity9 in @entity65 : prosecutors claim @entity1 was ' using @entity9 money to fund his defence and various appeals in connection with being prosecuted for benefit fraud ' @entity1 is also said to have falsely claimed £ 5,000 a month for work he claimed had been carried out by @entity74 based company @entity73 ( @entity75 )			1
it is alleged that he even set up a @entity78 bank account under the similar name of ‘ @entity80 ’ for funds from the @entity9 to be paid into , ‘ dishonestly obtaining ’ approximately € 355,000			0
giving details of @entity1 carrying out fraud to fund his rising legal bills , mr @entity32 said : ‘ he asked for payments to be made to the firm of solicitors on the basis that they were providing him with advice in relation to his duties as an mep			2
‘ in fact the money was being used to fund a number of criminal and civil proceedings related to mr @entity1 's prosecution for benefit fraud offences , and indeed some unrelated civil proceedings			1
‘ basically we say he was using @entity9 money to fund his defence and various appeals in connection with being prosecuted for benefit fraud			0
’ mr @entity32 continued : ‘ this was a sophisticated fraud committed over several years during which mr @entity1 made a number of false representations and produced a number of false documents in order to deceive the @entity9 into believing that significant amounts of work were being done on his behalf , relating to his work as an mep			1
pleading not guilty : @entity1 ( pictured again today ) allegedly fraudulently claimed almost £ 500,000 in expenses ‘ in total he dishonestly obtained approximately € 355,000 and £ 184,000 of allowances to which he was not entitled			0
it 's not quite half a million pounds , but it 's not far short			0
’ jurors heard that while @entity123 were allowed to make certain legitimate claims for expenses from the @entity9 , they were not supposed to use this money to enrich themselves			0
between 2004 , when he was elected @entity123 and 2009 , @entity1 claimed a total of £ 750,000 in @entity34 , taking into account his legitimate claims and any alleged fraudulent activity			1
@entity1 was elected a @entity1 for @entity131 in 2004 , but shortly before he actually took up his seat was thrown out of @entity134 's party because he was being prosecuted by the @entity135 for benefit fraud			1

the court heard that in april 2004 @entity1 's case for alleged income support , council tax and housing benefit fraud was sent to crown court to be dealt with , and he was elected as an mep two months later			1
elected as @entity1 : @entity1 ( pictured in 2006 ) was thrown out of @entity1 because he was being prosecuted by the @entity135 for benefit fraud but he made an application to the court saying that the criminal proceedings against him were a breach of his rights to free movement , as his bail conditions meant he could not travel freely to @entity152			1
the courts agreed with this and proceedings against @entity1 were stayed , prompting the prosecution to make an application to the attorney general to review the matter			0
jurors heard that in light of this , @entity1 wrote to the manager of @entity9 allowances asking for expenses to allow him to fight this			0
he wrote : ‘ i have to fund myself in the legal affairs committee against an attempt by the @entity27 government to unseat me as an mep			0
this is going to incur legal costs			0
’ however , mr @entity32 told the court that @entity1 did not disclose that he was being prosecuted for fraud			2
he said : ‘ what mr @entity1 does n't say is something along the lines of “ i am being prosecuted for fraud arising out of events prior to being elected as an mep ”			2
’ jurors heard that the attorney general overturned the decision and @entity1 was prosecuted and convicted of benefit fraud in august 2007			2
@entity1 denies four counts of obtaining a money transfer by deception , three of false accounting , two of fraud , and one each of acquiring criminal property and concealing criminal property			1
