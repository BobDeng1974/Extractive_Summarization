by @entity0 it is supposedly the next great technological leap forward that will carry us all into a brighter tomorrow – the ‘ wearable computer ’ that will revolutionise our daily lives			2
but will @entity6 be able to tell us if our flight is running late , whether there are traffic delays on the way to the airport , and where our lost bags have ended up ? faces of the future : staff at @entity16 try @entity6 devices for size they may well if the airline industry follows the example set by @entity16			2
the main transport hub in the @entity23 capital has stepped into the future after becoming the first airport in the world to equip its staff with @entity6			1
the experiment was conducted earlier this month , and declared a success by the airport ’s operational team , who found that it assisted in the job of looking after the 62,000 passengers who pass through the complex ’s four terminals every day			0
‘ the feedback from our passengers and service team has been overwhelmingly positive , ’ says the airport ’s @entity37			0
‘ we found @entity6 very easy to use , and more user - friendly than other devices such as tablets			1
‘ we can reduce the amount of paper our managers need to carry , such as duty rosters , desk allocation sheets , peak prognosis , passenger numbers and cruise arrivals			0
‘ and because the devices are hands - free , our managers are not focusing on a screen and can engage better with our passengers			1
’ a leap forward , maybe : reaction to the devices among passengers varied according to age group the devices are not yet available for passengers to use , but the airport hopes that they will be introduced on a wider basis at some point in the future – although there were also concerns about certain shortcomings in the technology			1
‘ the devices need improved scanning capability , battery life and reduced heating during operation , ’ says @entity73 of @entity74 , a technology firm which works with the air industry			1
‘ but the potential for widespread usage in the air transport industry is great			0
‘ @entity74 will continue testing and researching the best ways for this innovative technology to be embraced by airports and airlines			0
’ reaction from passengers at @entity16 was mixed			1
younger travellers recognised the @entity6 devices , and were positive about their implications			1
but older passengers were often unaware of the wearable items until they were pointed out to them – although they liked the concept when they were given details			2
changing times : @entity6 has been available to the public since may - but is still expensive ‘ the pilot was very promising , ’ says the airport ’s @entity100			0
‘ we are now investigating how we could efficiently introduce wearable technology to our passenger services team			0
’ @entity6 has been available to the public since may , although the price – @entity108 $ 1500 ( £ 1100 ) may still be considered prohibitive to the casual buyer .			0

@entity23 air hub *achieves* world first by trying out the wearable computers
mixed response from passengers - young travellers reacted more positively
devices have only been used on a trial basis , but may be fully introduced
