by @entity0 more than 260 aircraft have been involved in ' near misses ' in the skies above @entity5 in recent months , it can be revealed			1
of these , 32 incidents involved airliners , including eight cases when both aircraft were commercial passenger planes			1
the ' scheduled passenger ' flights included ' jumbo ' jet @entity13 , @entity15 and a @entity16 - some of the most common planes used by holidaymakers			1
details of the near misses have emerged following the terrifying near miss between two passenger planes at @entity23			1
' worst experience ever ' : the @entity25 comes into land at the airport as the @entity15 taxis across the runway the aircraft was forced to abort its landing after the first plane pulled out onto its landing tarmac ' go - around ' : the @entity16 pilot is forced to pull up and go around the other plane crossing its landing runway one of the 32 near misses fell into the most serious risk category - defined as ' aircraft proximity in which serious risk of collision has existed '			1
the @entity41 rated near miss involved an @entity43 and powered hang - glider and happened just after 8.30am on july 18 , last year around 2,000ft above @entity45			2
when a ' near miss ' is being assessed , investigators distinguish its seriousness based not on the distance between the two aircraft , but the level of risk involved			1
this judgement is made based on actual events - not on what could or could not have happened had the aircraft collided			2
there are five categories of descending seriousness			0
risk of collision : aircraft proximity where there has been a serious risk of collision			2
safety not assured : aircraft proximity in which the aircraft may have been unsafe			0
no risk of collision : aircraft proximity in which there was no risk of collision			0
risk not determined : aircraft proximity in which insufficient information was available to determine the risk , or there was inconclusive or conflicting evidence preventing a risk assessment			0
met the criteria for reporting but it was decided that normal procedures , safety standards and parameters were used			0
the figures can be revealed following video footage emerging of a near miss between two planes at @entity23 airport			0
the terrifying footage shows a plane pulling out to ' taxi ' across a runway while another plane , still airborne , descends towards the tarmac			0
footage shows the plane which had been cleared to land pulling off an emergency ' go - around procedure ' to avoid what could have been a fatal collision			0
near misses - known as @entity105 or @entity106 - are recorded in @entity5 airspace by the @entity108 , a body funded by the @entity111 and military aviation authorities			1
analysis of its data reveals that between january 2013 and may this year , there were 262 @entity106			0
more than 80 of these incidents involved military aircraft , while at least five police helicopters had near misses			1
other aircraft involved in @entity106 over the period include private jets , cargo planes and gliders as well as some being used for training flights			1
incidents have also been recorded by the board over the 17 months at altitudes of up to 34,000ft			2
an @entity106 is a situation where a pilot or air traffic services deem the distance between aircraft , as well as their relative positions and speed , may have compromised their safety .			0

more than 260 aircraft involved in near misses above @entity5 in recent months , including passenger planes , military aircraft and helicopters
eight incidents were involving two commercial passenger planes such as ' jumbo jet ' @entity13 , @entity147 or @entity15 @entity15
eighty of the near misses involved military aircraft , while at least another five were police helicopters coming a bit too close for *comfort*
