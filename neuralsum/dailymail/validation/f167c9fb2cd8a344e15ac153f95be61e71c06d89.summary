drivers are to get ten minutes extra time after a parking ticket runs out before they can be hit with a fine			1
under a change in the law to take effect within weeks , they will have the right to a ‘ grace period ’ in all on - street or off - street council parking places			1
for decades , drivers have complained of returning to their cars moments after a ticket expires to find a prowling warden has already hit them with a penalty			1
the new rules will apply to cars parked in a pay - and - display bays or other spaces with time limits			1
other new measures include a right for residents and local firms to demand that their council reviews parking in their area , including charges and use of yellow lines			2
@entity47 camera cars that automatically issue parking fines are to be made illegal , except near schools , in bus lanes and on red routes			1
broader guidance will also be issued , saying that councils can not use parking to make a profit			0
writing for @entity55 , @entity56 and communities secretary @entity57 and transport secretary @entity58 said ‘ war on the motorist must end ’			1
the ministers said in a joint statement : ‘ local residents and businesses will be able to demand a review of parking in their area , including charges and the use of yellow lines			0
parking adjudicators will be able to hold councils to account so they can look to change signs and stop charging fines in areas where parking tickets keep being issued			2
‘ we are bringing back common sense			0
‘ very soon shoppers and drivers will also benefit from ten minute “ grace periods ” for council - controlled parking , whether it ’s on or off - street , paid or free			1
it means you wo n’t get fined for being a few minutes late			0
we ’re also ending the industrial use of @entity47 spy cars to enforce on - street parking			1
’ local government and communities secretary @entity57 ( left ) and transport secretary @entity58 ( right ) have vowed to end the ' war on the motorist ' with their new ' common sense ' approach a new @entity89 , due to pass through the @entity90 next week and come into force next month , will enforce the ban on cctv being used to issue automated fines , except in high - risk areas			1
the @entity95 is tabling a separate parliamentary motion introducing ten - minute grace periods , which will come into effect later this month			2
the new rules are aimed at curbing draconian parking fines used by town halls to raise extra cash from motorists			1
without reform , the amount of money collected in parking charges and fines will soon hit £ 650million a year			1
critics say concerns about parking fines are prompting many motorists to shun high streets for out - of - town complexes			1
the government is also promising new restrictions against heavy - handed action by bailiffs chasing fines , and clearer rules to prevent penalties being issued at out - of - order parking meters when there is no alternative way to pay			1
councils have also been to volunteer to trial a scheme that allows motorists challenging a parking ticket to benefit from a 25 per cent discount on the fine if they lose the appeal			2
currently , drivers are only offered a discount on early payment before challenging a ticket			2
mr @entity57 added : ‘ we are ending the war on drivers who simply want to go about their daily business			1
for too long parking rules have made law - abiding motorists feel like criminals , and caused enormous damage to shops and businesses			1
the new rules will apply to cars parked in a pay - and - display bays or free spaces with time limits ( file picture ) ' over-zealous parking enforcement undermines our town centres and costs councils more in the long term			1
our measures not only bring big benefits for high streets , motorists and local authorities - they put common sense back into parking			2
' mr @entity58 said : ‘ helping local businesses thrive is a key part of our long term economic plan			2
these measures will deliver a fairer deal for motorists and help boost the high street by ensuring that parking enforcement is proportionate			2
’ local residents or firms will also be allowed to raise a petition that will require a council review of the use of yellow lines and unfair parking charges			2
a minimum of 50 council taxpayers ’ signatures or at least ten per cent of the residents or businesses in the affected local areas will be required			0
mr @entity57 and mr @entity58 claimed the last @entity183 government had made life ‘ unbearable for those behind the wheel as town halls failed to recognise the countless benefits that cars bring ’			1
‘ we ’re ending this pointless war on motorists so that you do n’t feel like a criminal just for parking your car , ’ they added			2
by @entity57 and @entity58 controversial cctv camera cars that automatically issue fines are to be made illegal too , the minister have said in the history of human invention , there ’s nothing that matches the car			1
we rely on them every day			0
to do our jobs , drop the kids off at school , or take an elderly relative shopping			0
cars mean freedom and independence , and most importantly of all , convenience			0
but years of crazy parking rules have made many law - abiding shoppers and drivers feel like criminals , and caused enormous damage to local shops and businesses			1
we all know the story			0
you return a minute late to find a parking ticket slapped on your windscreen			2
or maybe you run a local shop , and customers have dried up because what you sell costs less than the parking fee			0
in 2010 we said this war on the motorist must end			1
that meant not only changing the rules , but changing attitudes , because under the previous @entity56 councils were encouraged to fleece shoppers and rivers for every penny , treating them like cash machines on wheels			0
this included spying on and filming drivers going about their daily lives			0
where if you made a mistake it would mean an expensive bill in the post			0
if you protested it could mean a doubling of the original fine , or an angry bailiff knocking on your door			0
and all these parking rules were changed without proper debate by @entity257			1
residents and businesses just had to suffer in silence			0
these rules have now been changed during this parliament			0
local residents and businesses will be able to demand a review of parking in their area , including charges and the use of yellow lines			0
parking adjudicators will be able to hold councils to account so they can look to change signs and stop charging fines in areas where parking tickets keep being issued			2
we are bringing back common sense			0
very soon shoppers and drivers will also benefit from 10 minute “ grace periods ” for council - controlled parking , whether it ’s on or off - street , paid or free			1
it means you wo n’t get fined for being a few minutes late			0
we ’re also ending the industrial use of @entity47 ‘ spy cars ’ to enforce on - street parking			1
the new rules will end the plague of parking tickets in the post , but ensure public safety as @entity47 will still be used to protect schools , bus lanes and red routes			1
why have we done this ? because we want see fairness and balance restored to the system			0
as a result it will no longer possible to use parking to generate profit and we ’re cracking down on the use of aggressive bailiffs			0
and in another victory for common sense parking at an out - of - order meter will not result in a fine if there is no other way to pay			1
there are also occasions where shoppers and drivers receive a fine and appeal because they genuinely believe they ’ve done nothing wrong			0
we ’ll be trialling a new system so if this happens to you , you ’ll receive a 25 % discount even if the appeal is lost			0
these changes are great news for drivers but they are good news for town centres and business too			0
people supporting their local high street will be able to enjoy shopping without constantly worrying about trigger happy parking wardens waiting to pounce			2
under the previous administration life became unbearable for those behind the wheel as town halls failed to recognise the countless benefits that cars bring			0
we ’re ending this pointless war on motorists so that you do n’t feel like a criminal just for parking your car .			0
