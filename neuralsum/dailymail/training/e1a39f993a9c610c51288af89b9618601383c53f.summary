evidence from more than 6,600 rape kits that went untested for years in @entity2 , @entity3 , have turned up 850 hits in the @entity6 's nationwide database of dna profiles			1
but as the city marked a major step in its $ 6 million effort to address the backlog , officials admitted that there were some cases where suspects committed other sex crimes while evidence that could have identified them sat untested			1
so far charges have been filed against 29 people , six of whom have been convicted , since the city launched an effort in 2013 to test 6,663 rape kits			1
some of the kits date back as far as 1987			0
testing was completed in the fall , and the results have now been uploaded to a database used by investigators nationwide to compare dna profiles of possible suspects , mayor @entity25 said			2

untested kits like this sit in storage all over the country potentially allowing offenders to commit other crimes ' this milestone is of special importance to rape survivors and their families and friends because it means their cases are receiving the attention they should have years ago , ' @entity25 said at a news conference			1
police are continuing to review the matches to see if charges can be filed in other cases			2
in the cases where prosecutors have won convictions , defendants have received sentences ranging from two to 45 years in prison			1
one case was dismissed after the victim decided not to pursue the case			0
in some of the 850 matches the correct person had already been convicted			2
@entity2 mayor @entity25 said that the backlog ' is not a @entity2 problem			2
it 's not a @entity3 problem			0
it 's a nationwide issue that built up over years and years ' rape kits include biological samples and physical evidence gathered from sexual assault victims that are later processed to see if they match a suspect 's dna			1
testing results are uploaded to the @entity6 's @entity79 , or @entity79			1
a hit means that a suspect 's dna already was in a national law enforcement database in connection with an earlier crime			1
of those that went on to commit other crimes , while it is likely that they could have been identified at the time because their dna was already in @entity79 , it is difficult to tell if kits would have contained enough to provide an accurate profile given available technology			1
' now that the testing of these kits is complete , we know that it 's up to us to finish the job and to seek justice for these victims			2
the ball is in our court and we will do our best to put the people who are responsible for these heinous crimes behind bars for as long as possible , ' @entity105 district attorney @entity104 said			0
@entity105 district attorney @entity104 aims ' to put the people who are responsible for these heinous crimes behind bars for as long as possible ' in the case that led to the 45 - year prison sentence , @entity116 , 33 , plead guilty to aggravated sexual assault , the @entity113 reported			2
according to court documents , the assault occurred in may 2003			0
he broke into the victim 's @entity122 home in the morning and woke her , asking for money			0
when the victim , 38 at the time , said she did n't have any and attempted to fight him off , @entity116 began smothering her with a pillow			0
she pleaded with him to stop , asking him ' how can you do this , do n't you have a mother , ' he then raped her , occasionally brandishing a pocket knife			0
when he left , he took her cell phone and ripped the house phone off the wall			0
the victim was afraid to call the police because she worried it might affect her immigration status , but a coworker convinced her to call in the assault , and she agreed to take a sexual assault kit test			0
it is unclear why her kit went untested , but while it sat , @entity116 went on to commit and be convicted of burglary of a habitation with intent to commit sexual assault			1
he was also later sentenced for two aggravated sexual assault cases and indecency with a child			0
experts say @entity2 's backlog — and similar backlogs in other @entity156 cities — are due in part to the high cost of testing which can run from $ 500 to $ 1,000 per kit			1
advocates argue that the lack of testing signals that sex crimes have n't always been law enforcement priorities			1
mayor @entity25 advocates the work of @entity2 's specially designed taskforce as a model for other cities to follow			2
more than 12,000 kits went untested for years in @entity170 , which is facing a lawsuit from rape victims as it tries to test the kits			1
in @entity175 , prosecutors discovered more than 11,000 rape kits in an abandoned police warehouse in 2009 , and @entity179 prosecutors have sent their entire 4,700 - kit backlog for testing			1
