by mail online reporter it is one way to get between two of the planet ’s most fabled seaside destinations – but not necessarily one that many travellers would choose			2
after all , if you are going to make the journey between @entity10 and @entity11 , there are plenty of planes which cover the distance while you gaze out of the window			2
we made it , boys ! the adventurers leap into the ocean off @entity20 after completing their monster voyage and if you want to cross ( the western half of ) the @entity25 the easy way , many a cruise operator will also be happy to give you a leisurely lift			1
but rowing ? that might be quite hard work			2
not that this matters to a group of @entity32 university friends who have just entered the record books after rowing from @entity35 ’s west coast to its celebrated @entity25 state			1
@entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity40 set off from @entity41 , on the central coast of @entity10 , on 9 june			1
they rowed around 1000 miles each , battling against howling winds – which , on occasion , resulted in waves in the shark - infested waters reaching more than 20ft in height			0
almost there : the quartet bask in the moment as they make it to @entity55 the four @entity32 , who all met at the @entity56 , have now reached their final destination – the @entity59 capital @entity20 on the island of @entity55			1
all aged 24 , they are the youngest crew to ever row the distance , which is known as ' @entity63 '			1
the friends had spent a year preparing for the epic adventure , and almost two months on board the 24ft ocean rowing boat , called @entity68			1
using nothing but muscle power , the men rowed in pairs , rowing in two - hour shifts over the course of 50 days – travelling 3,100km ( 1927 miles )			2
the rovers ' arrival : the foursome crossed almost 2000 miles of the @entity25 to complete their journey they have so far raised more than £ 40,000 for the @entity80 , which raises awareness of @entity82 , a carcinogenic virus which causes five per cent of cancer cases worldwide , and infects one third of the @entity32 population			1
@entity39 , from @entity87 , @entity88 , says : ‘ each day our hands got a little more blistered and our stomachs decreased in size , which was definitely a good thing looking at some of the pre-departure photos			0
‘ but the worst aspect by far was the pain in our backsides			0
cocktail hour : after such a feat of endurance , the boys have definitely earned a drink ‘ spending pretty much 24 hours a day either sitting or lying on them , meant we were all on a constant stream of painkillers just to get through the days and be able to sit down , as we were just so blistered and raw			2
’ they had originally hoped to complete the challenge within 40 days , but were affected by bad weather and unfavourable winds , which pushed them south rather than west			0
@entity38 , from @entity115 , said : " this challenge has been immense , and at times it felt like we might not be able to complete it			0
‘ everyone 's support and messages , as well as our ultimate aim of raising awareness of @entity82 , have kept us going even when we did n't think we could give anymore			0
‘ somehow we always found the strength to keep rowing			0
’ scars of battle : every one of those 2,000 miles is written into the quartet 's hands @entity40 , from @entity131 , added : ' fter spending nearly eight weeks in a world less than 24 foot in length , @entity11 seems impossibly large			1
‘ we 're in a lot of pain , and have been for a few weeks now			0
we are barely able to sit , let alone stand , but everyone is so proud of one another			0

four university friends row from @entity41 across to @entity20 for *charity*
distance is almost 2000 miles , halfway across the planet 's biggest ocean
all aged 24 , they are the youngest ever rowing crew to achieve the feat
