by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 published : 22:33 est , 15 january 2013 updated : 22:33 est , 15 january 2013 incredible new images from the surface of @entity5 have provided a new glimpse into the @entity8 mission , including more possible evidence that there was once water on the on the @entity5			1
they are the latest in a series of snaps from the @entity5 landscape that have come courtesy of the @entity16 , which has been on the planet since august 5			1
the new photos came on the heels of an incredible photo from @entity5 ' surface that appeared to be a flower blooming among the rocks			1
scratching the surface : an image from the @entity16 's @entity25 shows the surface of the planet with inclined layering known as cross-bedding rock steady : this image released by @entity8 shows the flat area of @entity5 where @entity16 will conduct its first drilling site a piece of bright material can be seen to the left of this image captured by @entity8 's @entity16 on @entity5 but those hoping the flower would unlock evidence of life on other planets may be saddened to learn that the ' martian flower ' is nothing more than another rock			1
the space agency said on monday that the ' flower ' was a particularly shiny piece of sediment in the area			2
some of the images show veins in the rock that may hold clues to history of water on @entity5			2
meanwhile , scientists have zeroed in on a target area for @entity16 to begin drilling : a rock outcrop as flat as a pool table that 's expected to yield fresh insight into the red planet 's history			1
running a bit behind schedule , @entity16 was due to arrive at the site in the next several days			0
after an inspection of the surroundings , the car - size rover will test its drill for the first time ' probably in the next two weeks , ' project manager @entity66 of the @entity67 said tuesday			2
water works ? curiosity drives toward a flat rock with pale veins that may indicate the presence of water on the planet exploring : this photo provided by @entity8 shows well - defined veins filled with whitish minerals , which are believed to be calcium sulfate - a white mineral that 's common on @entity85 the highly anticipated drilling has been billed as the most complex engineering task since the acrobatic landing inside a @entity5 crater last summer			1
curiosity is on a quest to determine whether environmental conditions could have been favorable for microbes			2
by boring into a rock and transferring the powder to the rover 's onboard chemistry lab and other instruments , scientists should get a better understanding of the region 's mineral and chemical makeup			1
' we 're thrilled , and we ca n't wait to get drilling , ' said project scientist @entity106 of the @entity107			0
previous rovers opportunity and spirit carried a grinding tool that peeled away rock layers			2
rocky road : the rover 's next task will be to drill into the surface of the planet curiosity is capable of drilling down several inches to collect a sample from the interior - a first on @entity5			1
opportunity is still operating on the surface of @entity5 , but @entity109 lost contact with @entity85 in 2010			0
since the $ 2.5billion curiosity mission launched in 2011 , engineers have been troubleshooting an issue with the rover 's drill in which flakes of @entity129 can break off and get mixed with the rock samples			1
@entity66 said the contamination should not affect the mission			0
' we are reasonably confident that it 's something that we 'll be able to work our way around , ' he said			0
as the most high - tech interplanetary rover , @entity16 has been on a slow streak since its action - packed arrival			0
@entity106 said the pace of the mission was ' 100 per cent discovery - driven ' and ca n't be rushed			0
the @entity142 used to capture the image of the flower - like substance on @entity5 already , @entity16 has lingered longer than expected at its current location because scientists have been captivated by the sedimentary rocks that differ from the pebbles found at the landing site			0
after some last - minute studies , the rover will head to the rock outcrop dubbed ' @entity154 ' after a mission team member who died in 2011			1
@entity16 's ultimate goal is to drive to the base of @entity159 , a six - month journey with no stops			0
the plan is to begin the road trip after drilling is complete with pauses along the way .			0

so called *‘* @entity168 *’* captured by @entity8 *’*s curiosity rover appears to be blooming on the red planet
@entity8 says it is not *debris* as appears to be growing from rocky surface
space fans speculate it could be *quartz* *embedded* in the rock
