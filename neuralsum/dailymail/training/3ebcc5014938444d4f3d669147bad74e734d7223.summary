by @entity0 published : 20:55 est , 15 january 2014 updated : 13:29 est , 16 january 2014 viewers of a @entity4 - based sports newscast were horrified tuesday night when an explicit rendering of the @entity7 ' hated new mascot appeared on their screens with genitals in full view for 10 full seconds			1
@entity13 the @entity12 is the team 's first mascot in nearly 100 years , has no pants and was met with jeers immediately after his introduction monday			2
to goad on the @entity13 hate , sports blog @entity19 invited readers to photoshop parody versions of the bear , one of which ended up in all its au naturel glory on @entity30 's live broadcast tuesday			1
the new mascot ( left ) , seen at left , was met with jeers when he was introduced monday in part because he lacks pants it was the photoshopped version of @entity19 used to kick off its ' do something horrible to the @entity7 ' new , @entity46 ' contest on monday and featured a very prominent cartoon penis			1
' @entity13 is a young , friendly bear who ca n't wait to interact with the kids , ' @entity30 anchor @entity49 precisely as the vulgar cartoon appeared onscreen			0
to her credit , @entity53 remained poised quickly apologetic about the mistake			0
@entity33 , which reaches nearly 5 million viewers , accidentally aired the version from sports blog @entity19 just as anchor @entity49 said , ' @entity13 is a young , friendly bear who ca n't wait to interact with the kids ' but for around 10 seconds , @entity33 -- which reaches nearly 5 million households -- aired nsfw version			1
despite the gaffe and @entity13 's apparent unpopularity , the @entity7 are certain he will eventually be a hit			2
team officials say they held focus groups before deciding on @entity13 , and fans told them they wanted a more family - friendly atmosphere at @entity72			0
@entity13 will greet fans at @entity72 before and during games , and the mascot will have a @entity77 account and @entity79 page			0
it is safe to assume that , while he will not be wearing pants , neither will the actual @entity13 mascot be anatomically correct .			0

fans have jeered the *franchise* 's new @entity13 the @entity12 mascot , a young bear who wears no pants
sports blog @entity19 held a ' do something horrible to the @entity7 ' new , @entity46 '
@entity33 accidentally aired a @entity19 version of @entity13 with drawn - on genitals for 10 seconds on tuesday
