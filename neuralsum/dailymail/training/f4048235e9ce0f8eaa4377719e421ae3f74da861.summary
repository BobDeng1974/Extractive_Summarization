it 's a show in which stars reveal their pet hates in the hope of seeing them banished to @entity5			1
for @entity12 , however , appearing on the @entity7 programme to talk about one of his biggest grievances – caravans – has proved rather costly			1
after describing them as ‘ hideous ’ to @entity5 host @entity15 , the bushcraft expert was dropped as a speaker at the forthcoming @entity17 – a job which was set to make him at least £ 10,000			1
@entity12 ( right ) appeared with newsreader @entity19 ( left ) and comedian @entity20 on host @entity15 's @entity7 show discussing caravans in the episode , which was filmed in september but aired on @entity7 last friday , @entity12 , 50 , said : ‘ i just think they ’re hideous			1
‘ huge swathes of our coastline are just covered in these things			0
i would n’t mind so much if they could be painted green , but they have to be painted white			0
‘ you go down to @entity30 and all you can see are cities of these displaced urban people in their ghastly white caravans			0
’ while his comments may have been meant as a bit of fun , the organisers of @entity39 ’ speaking engagement were not amused in the slightest			2
@entity12 said on the show that caravans were a blight on @entity46 's coastline and are ' hideous ' and ' ghastly ' @entity47 of @entity48 , which is promoting the event next month at @entity51 ’s @entity50 , confirmed he had been dropped			2
she said : ‘ we booked @entity12 in november after the show was filmed , and there was never any mention of what he had said when we signed him up			1
‘ there was no way we can now have him come along to speak at our event – he has slagged off the community we are in charge of promoting and protecting			1
‘ we ca n’t align with someone who does n’t agree with our core values			0
he has insulted the people who come to the show			2
’ she confirmed he had lost out on a ‘ five - figure sum ’ , adding : ‘ it ’s all a bit elitist , saying that you are ok going outdoors if you are staying in a man - made shelter			0
' it ’s a shame because we are all about getting kids off their backsides and into the outdoors , an ideology i ’d have thought we would have shared			0
’ @entity12 has not responded to requests for comment , but ms @entity78 claimed his agent was ' very apologetic '			0
she added : ' he should n't have taken the job if he has fundamental issues with caravans			0
' but his tirade has hit him in the pocket after a £ 10,000 appearance at the @entity86 , @entity87 and @entity17 was cancelled after the programme was aired @entity12 had been used on publicity material for the show , but organisers now feel he 's ' slagged them off ' many caravan fans have criticised the ‘ hypocritical ’ survival expert online			1
writing on a forum at caravanclub.co.uk , a user called @entity96 said : ‘ pity he is so against caravanning , until of course there ’s [ a ] chance of some money			2
' ‘ he should be taken to the @entity50 in a caravan with @entity105 towing it ! ’ @entity107 wrote : ‘ oh dear ... i wonder how much he ’s being paid to be a complete hypocrite ? ’ organisers of the show , which runs between 17 - 22 february , are hoping @entity112 , formerly of @entity113 , will be able to replace @entity12			2
other stars who are expected to appear include tv presenter @entity115 and former athlete @entity116			0
