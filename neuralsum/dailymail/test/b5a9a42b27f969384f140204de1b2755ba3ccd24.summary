@entity1 escaped justice after the @entity4 ’s top prosecutor over-ruled the advice of two of the country ’s most senior qcs , it emerged last night			1
director of public prosecutions @entity9 was encouraged by two aides to charge the @entity13 peer with historic sex crimes			1
both @entity15 and child abuse expert @entity17 , leading counsel to the investigation , offered advice which could have supported a move to prosecute			0
but mrs @entity9 decided that it was not in the public interest to put @entity1 in the dock due to his advanced @entity36 , sparking a storm of controversy			1
the latest revelation came as mrs @entity9 endured a barrage of criticism for ending the case before it could reach court			1
campaigners , mps and victims believe a ‘ trial of the facts ’ could have satisfied the need to get the bottom of the appalling claims against @entity1 whatever his mental state			2
figures from across the political spectrum are clamouring for the decision be reversed amid fears of a ‘ whitewash ’			1
last night , two senior government figures joined the chorus of disapproval and said the concerns were justified			0
@entity15 , right and @entity17 , left , both recommended @entity1 should face trial health secretary @entity64 said there was something ‘ very strange ’ about the decision and health minster @entity68 called for the matter to be settled by the courts			1
accusing the cps of ‘ heinous errors ’ , mr @entity68 said the authorities should examine precedents of people with dementia being brought to trial			2
‘ my concern is that because the @entity78 and indeed the @entity79 at a local level have made errors in this case , heinous errors by failing to bring a prosecution earlier when there was evidence there to do so , ’ he said			2
‘ this matter should not be concluded by the @entity78 and should be brought before a court			0
‘ there is a precedent of people with dementia being brought to trial			2
with allegations as serious as this it seems to me that this is the right approach			0
’ mr @entity64 said @entity97 and home secretary @entity98 had been ‘ right ’ to express concern at the decision			2
‘ i think she ’s right to do so and i think @entity97 is right to do so as well because i think we all think that there is something very , very strange here where someone was signing official letters only a matter of weeks ago and is somehow escaping prosecution for something so incredibly serious , ’ he said			0
meanwhile @entity111 , a @entity113 peer and leading legal expert , said that although there was strong evidence that @entity1 was suffering from dementia , the decision not to proceed with legal action should be reconsidered			1
earlier this week , leading politicians from seven parties came together to attack the latest decision not to prosecute @entity1 and demand the decision be reversed amid public concerns of a ‘ whitewash ’			1
the cross-party group , led by @entity13 ’s @entity127 , wrote to @entity128 saying : ‘ as long as justice is not seen to be done and the greater public interest is not served , the public will see attempts to investigate establishment figures involved in historic child abuse as a whitewash			1
’ mrs @entity9 announced last week that there was enough evidence to charge @entity1 with 22 crimes against nine victims but said it was not in the public interest to do so			1
mrs @entity9 ’ decision not to prosecute came after a two - year multi-million pound inquiry by @entity145 examining allegations spanning four decades			1
it led to a furious public row with victims saying they will never see justice and police threatening a @entity154 legal challenge			0
mrs @entity9 defended her decision saying it is her duty to make the right judgment even when it is unpopular			1
but the @entity159 can reveal @entity160 offered advice which could have supported a move to prosecute			0
mayor of london @entity163 , pictured , has expressed concern over the failure to charge @entity1 she told mrs @entity9 it was unlikely prosecutors would be ‘ susceptible ’ to a judicial review if she took @entity1 to court			1
senior lawyers feared @entity1 ’s legal team , closely advised by his @entity175 son @entity174 , would try and block the case with a @entity154 challenge focusing on his ill health			1
but mrs @entity179 is understood to have said that as long as prosecutors had the support of his alleged victims it was unlikely any such review would be successful			0
@entity17 , who was leading counsel to the investigation , recommended that he be charged			0
mrs @entity28 pointed to overwhelming evidence and horrific corroborating accounts provided by victims during the exhaustive police inquiry			0
mrs @entity9 concluded that there was enough evidence to prosecute but @entity1 ’s ill health prevented any criminal proceedings			1
she appointed two of the country ’s foremost dementia experts who concluded his dementia is at an advanced stage and would never improve			2
they were professor @entity200 , of @entity201 , and dr @entity202 , of the @entity203 and @entity204			0
at least 10 men with dementia have been convicted of child sex offences since 2010 , including six in the past year			0
mrs @entity9 has told friends that she has no intention of quitting over the @entity1 row			1
one said : ‘ she says she will not be hounded out of office			0
she is absolutely determined to stay in post			0
’ in the coming months , she is due to rule on whether @entity214 ’s @entity213 should face corporate charges over the phone hacking scandal which engulfed the @entity217			0
@entity219 detectives investigating alleged corporate crime are seeking to bring a case that would force senior executives to be held to account			0
a @entity79 spokeswoman confirmed mrs @entity28 advised mrs @entity9 to prosecute and said mrs @entity179 was consulted on an ‘ ancillary matter ’			2
she said : ‘ it is the director of @entity227 ’s job to make these extremely difficult decisions , and that is what she has done in this case			0
‘ as the ultimate decision maker , she receives advice from a number of internal and external lawyers but the decision is based , ultimately , on her own assessment of the relevant law and circumstances of the case , no one else ’s			2

@entity9 decided against pressing charges against @entity1
she was *persuaded* against taking a case by the @entity13 peer **'s** dementia
two of @entity4 **'s** foremost legal experts recommended pressing charges
political sources want the decision overturned over ' whitewash ' fears
