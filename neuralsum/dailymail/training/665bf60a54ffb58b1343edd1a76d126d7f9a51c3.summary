@entity0 hopes @entity1 will respond to seeing their eight - point lead over defending @entity4 champions @entity3 evaporate			1
@entity1 lost 5 - 3 at @entity5 on @entity6 and now sit level with @entity3 at the top of the table after @entity10 , a team - mate of @entity0 's for 13 seasons at @entity12 , scored to earn last season 's league winners victory over @entity15 earlier in the day			1
it was @entity1 's second loss of the season , but stuttering away form has allowed @entity3 to wipe out the deficit			1
videos scroll down to watch @entity1 captain @entity0 looks on after @entity1 concede their fourth against @entity5 on thursday @entity0 admitted he has found it difficult to see their eight - point advantage over @entity3 wiped out @entity25 ( left ) of @entity5 shoots past @entity0 ( centre ) and into the net as @entity1 lost 5 - 3 ' it 's hard to see them claw us back , ' @entity0 said on chelseafc.com			1
' we were eight points in front and now we 're level on points			1
' it 's disappointing to have lost that lead but we said in the dressing room we 'll come together , put a run together and hopefully get a lead again			0
' @entity39 , who railed over a ' clear campaign ' against @entity1 following the draw at @entity42 , was outraged by further perceived injustices against his side			1
like his manager , @entity0 believed the @entity46 should have had a penalty when 1 - 0 up after @entity48 fell on the ball and brushed it with his hand			2
' we should have had a penalty at @entity42 and we should have had another one at 1 - 0 , ' said the captain , who scored @entity1 's third			1
' the game 's finished then			0
sometimes you get them , sometimes you do n't , and in the last few games we have n't			0
' we 're very disappointed to start the new year with a defeat but we 'll move on from this			0
@entity39 ( centre ) was frustrated with the display of referee @entity63 at @entity64 @entity39 questioned @entity63 's ( fourth left ) ability to keep up with play during the game against @entity5 @entity0 felt @entity1 should have had a penalty when @entity48 ( left ) appeared to handle in the area ' i thought at times we played some really good football , it just was n't our day so we 'll forget this one and move on very quickly			1
' once we got the goal they were on the back foot but they scored from nothing and were back in the game			0
' the defeat could have many ramifications , not least for the title race and @entity39 , who invited scrutiny on the performance of referee @entity63 at @entity64 and could face @entity87 disciplinary action			2
@entity39 felt @entity89 had brought down @entity90 when the last man and should have been sent off			0
despite accepting @entity90 's version of events and that no foul had been made , @entity39 used the incident to highlight @entity63 's display			0
@entity39 told @entity97 : ' hazard , honest as always , tells me in his opinion it was not a foul or a red card , so that 's good , in spite of mr @entity63 is too slow to go with that ball , he was like 40 yards away , he made the right decision			0
@entity90 ( centre ) told boss @entity39 that he did not believe @entity89 's ( left ) challenge was a foul @entity111 ( left ) could face disciplinary action after kicking @entity25 ( right ) in the back late on in the game ' the decision ( that ) was like 10 metres away , he could n't make and that 's a decision that is the crucial moment of the game			0
' that was a reference to the @entity119 incident , which came when @entity1 led and @entity39 was unwilling to forget , even though many thought it incidental in a game where @entity1 conceded five goals			2
disciplinary action may await for the @entity123 and @entity1 defender @entity111 , who may be punished for kicking @entity25 in the back late in the game while the striker was on the ground .			2
