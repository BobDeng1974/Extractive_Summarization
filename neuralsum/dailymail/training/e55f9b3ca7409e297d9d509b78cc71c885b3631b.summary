' today , we can confirm that @entity3 is indeed developing a @entity21 with two - edge displays , one on each side , reports our source , ' said the @entity53 site			1
the curved screen has already been used in @entity3 's @entity55			1
however , @entity56 will have the ability to work in a left or right handed mode ' you will have an option to choose favourite contacts and an ability to assign specific colours to them , ' explained @entity11			2

earlier this month , in the face of stiff competition , and following a consecutive drop in profits , @entity3 announced plans to curb the number of phones it makes each year			2

compared to a record - high of £ 6 billion ( $ 9.5 billion ) in 2013 , the company achieved £ 2.5 billion ( $ 3.8 billion ) profits for july to september			0
these figures were in line with what @entity3 predicted earlier in october , and the firm blamed the drop on weak sales of its new @entity1 model			0
the @entity13 electronics giant became the biggest smartphone brand thanks to the popularity of earlier @entity1 models			0
but the larger screen on @entity16 's new @entity195 has been linked with luring customers away from the larger @entity1 range			1
while in @entity199 , local brands are making inroads into @entity3 's business			0
in response to the dramatic drop , @entity3 also vowed to revamp its smartphone range to win back customers			0

the company said it ' cautiously expects increased shipments of new smartphones and strong seasonal demand for tv products '			0
the latest profit drop comes despite the launch of the @entity253 ( pictured ) earlier this year , which was received by mostly rave reviews			0
the @entity253 handpicked features from its competitors and put them all into a single handset , with some calling it a ' superphone ' in emerging markets , such as @entity227 and @entity199 , @entity3 's smartphone sales were overtaken by local rivals			1
' rather than seeking stability , @entity3 should seek to distinguish [ its phones ] with @entity1 's design policies , ' @entity261 , an analyst at @entity262 said			1
the company moved the launch of the @entity268 , a large smartphone with a stylus , to late september from october after @entity16 unveiled the @entity270			1
