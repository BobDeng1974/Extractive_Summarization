if the law was changed , details could be withheld from inquests like his the historic principle that justice should be seen to be done is threatened by hugely controversial plans to allow secret hearings , ministers are being warned			1
proposals for sweeping new powers which would allow the government to withhold any evidence it deems ‘ sensitive ’ from an open civil court hearing or inquest are facing a chorus of criticism			2
former director of public prosecutions @entity21 yesterday attacked the government ’s proposal for so - called ‘ closed material procedures ’ in civil courts , an attempt to prevent sensitive claims for damages being aired in open hearings			2
critics say the legislation has been ‘ dictated ’ by the security services following an embarrassing string of cases brought against them by former terrorist suspects who claimed they had been subjected to torture			1
in the case of @entity39 , a former @entity40 prisoner who sought to sue the government for complicity in torture , the government tried to conceal documents disclosing his alleged mistreatment but were overruled by the courts			2
there is increasing concern that justice secretary @entity50 ’s proposals will mean ministers being able to prevent a huge range of cases – from military inquests to police and medical negligence claims – being held in public			1
negligence claims against the @entity60 for death and injuries arising from ‘ friendly fire ’ incidents or failure of equipment would be a prime target for ministers seeking to avoid embarrassment , campaigners predict			1
past cases such as the inquiry into the shooting of @entity2 by police who mistook him for a terrorist could have been hushed up by the government if the measures had been in force at the time			1
and @entity80 ’s failings over the 7/7 bombings might never have come to light			0
@entity83 , director of civil rights campaign group @entity84 , called the proposals a ‘ shameless attempt to cover up abuses of power ’			0
she said : ‘ proposed legislation would n’t just end the long - held principle that no one is above the law – it would exclude the press , public and victims from seeing justice done			1
concern : @entity50 was facing calls to drop the plans to drop plans to allow secret hearings ‘ open courts and investigative journalists fought to uncover some of the worst scandals of the war on terror			1
under these plans , future ministers would be granted sweeping powers to lock down embarrassing inquests and civil claims against the powerful			1
victims of gross abuses of power , the public and the @entity94 could be left in the dark for ever			0
’ under the proposals , ministers will be able to order not only that a hearing is conducted behind closed doors , but also that claimants are denied access to government evidence or witnesses			0
the reforms , detailed in a @entity125 on justice and security , are backed by senior figures in the security community , notably sir @entity130 , chairman of the parliamentary intelligence and security committee			1
but legal experts in the field appear increasingly uneasy			0
@entity21 , @entity135 , said the plans would put the government ‘ above the law ’ and must be reconsidered			1
‘ these unprecedented proposals are an audacious attack on the fundamental principle of @entity143 justice : that you should be able to know , and to challenge , the claims which are made against you , ’ he said			0
‘ they threaten to put the government above the law , while leaving ordinary citizens , and the @entity94 , shut out of their own justice system			1
‘ after a decade in which we have seen our politicians and officials caught up in the woeful abuses of the war on terror , the last thing the government should be seeking is to sweep all of this under the carpet			0
however , that is exactly what their disastrous secret justice proposals are likely to do			0
questions and answers ‘ we can not afford to sleepwalk into a system of secret courts			0
@entity170 came to power saying “ sunlight is the best disinfectant ”			0
we should not sacrifice @entity143 ’s open and transparent justice system simply to protect politicians and their officials from embarrassment			0
’ concern is shared by significant numbers of ‘ special advocates ’ , an elite group of barristers and solicitors who have special rights to deal with cases that involve evidence restricted due to national security concerns , the @entity178 has learned			2
though these are the lawyers who would administer the government ’s new system , 57 out of the 69 current special advocates have indicated they they do not agree with the plans			2
@entity194 , @entity135 , a serving special advocate , said : ‘ special advocates were never intended as a substitute for a fair trial and the inherent weaknesses of this system will leave a justice gap			0
’ the prime minister has said he is deeply worried by the ‘ inability of the security services to defend themselves in civil cases because they can not compromise national security by revealing sensitive information in open court ’			1
a @entity211 spokesman said : ‘ we have a growing problem in this country where individuals are alleging @entity191 wrongdoing but the courts do not have the tools they need to get to the bottom of the matter			1
‘ the reason for this is that the evidence on which the case rests is either intelligence material given to us by our allies – which we have promised not to reveal – or it is material which could reveal the identity of sources , or damage our ability to keep the public safe			0
‘ this means that the government is unable to defend its actions if the material has to be given in open court			0
it means that the claimants are left without any clear judgments by a judge based on all the relevant information , and most importantly it leaves the public with no independent judgment by a court on very serious matters			2
‘ we are therefore consulting widely on our proposal to allow sensitive evidence in this small number of cases to be argued before a judge in a closed court with the safeguards needed to protect public safety			2

friendly fire deaths , police shootings and medical negligence cases could all have information withheld from them
