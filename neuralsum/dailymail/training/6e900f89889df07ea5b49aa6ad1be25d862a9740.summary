with the weather getting chillier , it can only mean one thing : the ski season is nearly upon us			0
and though the sport is one of the most thrilling and exhilarating , the slopes are also quite often the location of numerous social faux pas			0
some of the most common ? failing to keep your speed under control , stopping half - way down the slopes , and voicing an overly condescending attitude about the difficulty ( or lack thereof ) of the run			2
lucky for us , @entity19 has compiled this handy infographic highlighting the main dos and don'ts of the ski season			1
offer to share your chair lift ride with a stranger , refrain from lighting up a cigarette on the hill , and do n't be afraid to ask for help when you need it			1
yes , we 're looking at you , amateur skiers - there 's nothing wrong with signing up for a quick refresher of a lesson before heading out with friends			0
most importantly ? be aware of your surroundings on the mountain and offer to help others when needed			1
and , of course , have fun !			0
