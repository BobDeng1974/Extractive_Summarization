it takes your eyes , and your brain , a moment to adjust as you move from the dazzling @entity6 sun into the dusty , dimly lit warehouse			1
workers stand by a pile of elephant tusks , systematically weighing each one on a large red @entity13 scale			2
behind them , rows of tall metal shelves recede into the gloom			0
they are stacked solid with tusks , each pair the sole remnant of a once - magnificent elephant			2
cruel trade : @entity24 visits the world 's largest ivory stockpile in @entity6 , containing more than 34,000 tusks which would be worth about £ 150million on @entity29 's black market more tusks lie in sacks on the concrete floor			1
it is an appalling , sickening sight			0
this is the world ’s largest ivory stockpile			0
more than 34,000 tusks weighing roughly 125 tons are stored in the warehouse behind the @entity37 in @entity38			1
they would be worth about £ 150 million on @entity29 ’s black market			1
some were taken from elephants that died naturally or turned rogue			2
many thousands were seized from poachers or their middlemen and can not be sold because international trade in ivory is banned			0
they are black , brown and dirty white			2
a few bear the marks of the machetes used to hack them from the elephants			2
the biggest is nearly 7ft long , weighs 191 lb and takes three people to lift			1
the shortest measure scarcely a foot and were ripped from babies – testimony to the indiscriminate slaughter of the poachers who kill 30 @entity6 elephants a day and have destroyed half the country ’s 110,000 elephants since 2009			1
elephant graveyard : @entity67 , a game scout at the @entity70 game reserve where the number of elephants have been reduced from 70,000 elephants in 2006 to 13,000 the stockpile is a shrine to human greed			2
its only redeeming feature is that the tusks were intercepted before they were smuggled to @entity80 , but the amount of ivory that passes undetected though @entity6 ’s ports is far greater			1
the country is easily the world ’s biggest exporter of this illicit ‘ white gold ’			1
the @entity88 was given exclusive access to the warehouse after publishing an article , just before last month ’s @entity93 summit on the illegal wildlife trade , that asked how the @entity96 and prime minister could shake the hand of @entity99 , the @entity6 leader who has presided over such a slaughter			1
we reported that many politicians , officials and well - connected businessmen were active accomplices in the illegal ivory trade , and that there was corruption from top to bottom			0
the article caused uproar in @entity6			1
a well - placed source said president @entity99 was ‘ hopping mad ’			1
his office denounced the article as ‘ malicious , preposterous and contemptible ’			1
his government consulted @entity117 public relations advisers			0
but the article had a dramatic effect			0
before leaving for the @entity93 summit , mr @entity99 summoned senior wildlife officials , tearing up his prepared notes as he angrily demanded that they do better			0
then , at the summit , he astounded the conservation world by announcing that @entity6 would put its vast stockpile ‘ beyond economic use ’ and support a continued ban on international trade in ivory			1
that was an astonishing u-turn			0
three times in eight years @entity6 had unsuccessfully sought approval from the 180 - nation @entity133 ( @entity133 ) to sell its stockpile – despite overwhelming evidence that one - off sales merely fuel @entity29 ’s appetite for ivory			1
‘ the article shamed the president in front of the world , ’ said one source			1
‘ he really had to come and say something concrete at the summit , ’ said another			1
there was one more surprise			0
@entity149 , the minister for natural resources and tourism , invited @entity88 to @entity6			1
‘ we have nothing to hide , ’ he said			1
my visit included a trip to the @entity70 game reserve , a spectacularly beautiful wilderness and @entity158 double the size of @entity160 , where the shocking scale of @entity6 ’s poaching frenzy became clear			1
@entity163 had 70,000 elephants in 2006			2
at the peak of the onslaught rotting carcasses defiled the reserve ’s woodlands , savannahs and swamps , and tourists could hear shooting from their lodges			0
for the better part of two days , @entity174 , the reserve ’s chief warden , and i jolted along in a @entity179 , scattering giraffes and impalas , zebras and warthogs , baboons and waterbuck			0
countless hippos wallowed in the swollen brown waters of the @entity188			0
my visit coincided with the rainy season , so the elephants had wandered far from their usual watering holes , but during those two days we saw just one , a bull who retreated into the bush			2
only from the air did we spot more – three here , six there – sad remnants of once abundant herds			0
even carcasses are becoming rarer as poachers seek richer pickings elsewhere in @entity6			1
the only one we saw was a month old – a scattering of hefty white bones picked clean by hyenas and jackals			2
that is what @entity163 has become : an elephant graveyard			0
‘ it ’s a tragedy , ’ mr @entity174 said			1
mr @entity149 is young , engaging , smartly dressed and @entity211 - educated			2
he visits the @entity212 one weekend a month to pursue a master ’s degree in international relations			2
he is also a good talker			0
he acknowledged that corruption was ‘ huge ’ and that @entity88 article ‘ really got a lot of people thinking ’			1
he said poaching was the country ’s ‘ number one national security problem ’ and insisted the president was determined to defeat it			2
questioning power : the original @entity88 article that left @entity6 president @entity99 ' hopping mad ' , published last month not so long ago the @entity6 government denied there was even a problem			1
mr @entity149 declared that @entity232 , a very effective military - led crackdown on poachers which was suspended after a month last autumn because of human rights abuses , would soon be relaunched with strict safeguards			1
he added that his ministry ’s wildlife division would be relaunched this year as an autonomous wildlife authority with greater powers			0
he promised more game scouts with better equipment , tougher penalties for poaching and a crackdown on corrupt port officials , customs officers and police			0
‘ we are serious about doing everything , and i mean everything , to save the elephants , ’ he said			1
what mr @entity149 failed to address was the crucial issue of high - level complicity in @entity6 ’s illegal ivory trade			1
nobody seriously contends that 11,000 elephants a year can be killed in a one - party state with a strong security apparatus , or that their tusks can be spirited across the country and out of its ports , without the help of powerful patrons			2
mr @entity149 himself told the @entity271 last month that he ‘ had the names of politicians , senior people ’			1
the @entity88 has been told that mr @entity99 received a dossier from his intelligence services last year listing the names and roles of nearly 50 senior politicians , officials and businessmen involved in the ivory trade , most with links to his @entity284 party			0
none has been arrested and convicted			0
under threat : poachers kill 30 @entity6 elephants a day and have destroyed half the country 's 110,000 elephants since 2009 nobody accuses mr @entity99 of involvement in smuggling , but one authoritative source said : ‘ he finds it very difficult to go after anybody related to him or his friends			1
’ mr @entity149 also revealed that the destruction of @entity6 ’s stockpile was far from certain , despite mr @entity99 ’s @entity93 pledge			1
he said the president was willing to burn it , but in return @entity6 wanted roughly £ 30 million from the international community for an elephant conservation fund			1
potential @entity308 donors scoff at that unrealistically high figure			0
the warehouse , i discover , is hardly @entity312			0
it has two sliding steel doors with five heavy padlocks whose keys are divided between two chief storemen , but the doors were wide open when i arrived			0
each tusk is marked and catalogued , and the warehouse has internal security cameras , but i saw no armed guards outside			0
@entity324 has allegedly been stolen from the stockpile in the past and in 2009 the inventory was destroyed in a mysterious fire			0
in @entity70 , at least , there is now a glimmer of hope for the elephants thanks to mr @entity174 , an ebullient character whose energy and drive belie his 62 years			0
he is short of weapons , vehicles and manpower , but has started moulding his scouts into a force capable of fighting the poaching gangs			0
he has imported 220 hand - picked volunteers to boost the 250 existing scouts and has formed 75 six - man patrols			0
as a result , mr @entity174 believes the poaching frenzy in @entity70 is finally starting to abate			0
‘ our children will curse us if we do n’t do what were supposed to do , ’ he says			2
now @entity6 desperately needs at national level what mr @entity174 brings to @entity163 : strong leadership willing to tackle a corrupt elite			2
but nobody is holding their breath .			0

mail on sunday 's @entity24 goes inside the warehouse in @entity6
@entity38 holds 34,000 tusks ripped from *17,000* elephants
