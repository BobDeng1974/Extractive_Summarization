@entity0 and @entity1 will likely go head - to - head at the @entity3 on saturday			1
they are at starkly different places in their careers with 26 - year - old @entity1 perhaps acting as a cautionary tale for @entity0 , 20 , that early promise can sometimes give way to unfulfilled potential			1
both are in the process of negotiating contracts with their respective clubs			0
@entity15 has spoken in the past of his admiration for @entity1 while @entity18 has made no secret he is a fan of @entity0			1
it is not beyond the realms of possibility that the clubs could do a direct swap			0
although @entity18 would have to deviate from his usually cautious financial approach to win the race to sign @entity0 while @entity15 would be hard pushed to sell @entity1 as a worthy replacement for @entity0			1
here @entity28 looks at the merits of the two @entity31 wingers			0
@entity1 and @entity0 , @entity33 's leading wingers , are both in contract negotians with their clubs @entity0 has been one of @entity37 's best players this season , but his contract dispute has caused problems this season so far @entity0 : he has been one of @entity37 ’s best players throughout the season , making 28 @entity46 appearances and scoring six top - flight goals while boasting an impressive 81 % pass completion rate			1
he has as struggled to make an impact since being used as a wing - back			0
@entity1 : there ’s not a lot to go on for @entity1 , who has played just 13 games in all competitions , struggling for game time after returning from a long - term layoff for a knee injury			1
@entity58 do seem to perform slightly better when @entity1 features , winning 62.50 % of their @entity46 games when he is in the team , compared to 59.1 % without him			1
@entity61 ? @entity0 : while @entity0 ’s contract negotiations might be viewed as a distraction to the team he has been an unselfish and determined player during his career so far , providing seven assists in the @entity46 this season			1
he has linked up well with @entity68 before the striker was injured and happily played second fiddle to @entity71 last season when @entity15 built his team around the @entity74			2
@entity1 : is always encouraging to younger players and a good influence to have in the dressing room but he has failed to provide one assist this season and rarely contributes to defensive duties			1
@entity1 looked out of sorts for @entity33 this week , and has not yet provided an assist this season @entity0 turns away from @entity58 's @entity82 when the two clubs met earlier this season @entity84 @entity0 : @entity0 is undoubtedly exciting , can provoke disbelief with his mazy runs and deceptive strength for someone so slight			1
but his biggest strength is his pace			0
his top speed this season of 21.77 mph puts him sixth in the @entity46 rankings			0
the problem could lie in the fact he may not be as good as he thinks he is			0
@entity1 : the off - the - mark pace and an eye for the unconventional yet effective pass which made @entity1 a sensation as a 16 - year - old playing for @entity100 have waned somewhat			1
although he is still quick , his fastest sprint this season registering at 21.11 mph , a series of injuries have impacted his speed			0
his inventiveness off - the - ball has been dulled by a lack of confidence			0
if he can have a period of uninterrupted play he might be able to recapture some of his ‘ wow factor ’ but he is never going to be a world - class player or a game changer			0
first team opportunities have been limited for @entity1 this season , with the winger frustrated by injury @entity0 has scored six times and created 62 chances in the @entity46 this season @entity121 ' favourite ? @entity0 : @entity0 has damaged his public image , possibly irreparably , in the red half of @entity124 with protracted contract wrangling over recent weeks			1
he said in an interview with the @entity128 ’s @entity127 that he wanted to dispel the idea he was a greedy 20 - year - old			0
but he could have done that simply by signing a £ 100,000 a week contract at a club where he plays regularly and the manager is proven at developing young talent , if that really was the case			0
@entity1 : he is a likeable personality , rarely in the headlines for the wrong reasons , but fans will ultimately judge him on his play and @entity1 seems to divide opinion			2
he has flashes of brilliance but his form is erratic and fans want someone they can count on			0
the future @entity0 : it is easy to forget @entity0 , who made his full @entity37 debut at 17 years , 107 days , is still only 20			2
on the face of it his future is blindingly bright and his potential boundless			0
@entity0 has hit a top speed of 21.77 mph this season , ranking him sixth in the @entity46			1
@entity1 's fastest speed this season is 21.11 mph			1
clubs all over @entity156 are said to be monitoring him and he has admitted it is his dream to play for a big club ‘ somewhere warm ’ but we have seen all too many times young talent going unrealised			0
the decisions @entity0 and his advisors make in the coming months could be crucial			2
@entity1 : for @entity1 , who was selected for his first @entity163 at 16 , the last six years have been marred by a failure to deliver on his promise			2
those clubs who might be interested in signing him should take encouragement from the fact we might not have seen the best of @entity1 yet			2
@entity0 might have permanently damaged his relationship with the @entity37 fans with his interview the 20 - year - old could still stay at @entity176 beyond this summer if manager @entity15 gets his way			2

@entity18 is a great admirer of @entity0 , while both he and @entity1 are struggling to negotiate new deals
@entity0 has scored more goals and provided more assists this season
@entity1 is an example of unrealised potential that @entity0 must avoid
