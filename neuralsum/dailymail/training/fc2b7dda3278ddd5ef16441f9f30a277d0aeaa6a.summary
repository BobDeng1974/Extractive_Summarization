a mother 's leg ballooned to twice its size after she was bitten by what is believed to be a false widow spider			1
@entity5 , 33 , from @entity6 , @entity7 , feared she would lose her leg after an infection from the bite caused the limb to turn black , yellow and covered in huge blisters			1
she also began vomiting after being bitten by the venomous creature in the beer garden of the @entity17 and @entity18 pub , @entity6			1
she spent three days being treated in hospital and is still struggling to walk			1
ms @entity5 , a learning support assistant , said : ' i had to go to the hospital			1
i was completely petrified ; i thought i was going to lose my leg or something worse because of the bite			1
' the mother said she watching her daughter and her friend 's child play in the garden when she felt a sharp bite on her leg			1
she then felt a tingling , followed by a numbness , as the infection began to take hold			0
she said : ' i was sitting in the beer garden while my daughter and my friend 's child were playing and i felt a sharp bite on my leg			1
' i brushed the spider off immediately and my leg started to go numb and felt itchy			1
my condition deteriorated and i started vomiting and huge blisters swelled up on my leg			1
' ms @entity5 saw her gp , who prescribed her antibiotics			0
but her condition soon deteriorated and she says her leg doubled in size			1
three days later , she went to hospital , fearing she might lose her leg			1
as well as her leg turning black and yellow , it also became covered in huge blisters , pictured earlier this week , hairdresser @entity64 told how she had to have one of her fingers amputated after a bite from a false widow spider that she sustained in @entity70 , @entity71 , led to her catching a flesh - eating bug			1
ms @entity5 said : ' at the hospital , the bed was not working properly so i had to prop up my leg with a stool which meant i had a very uncomfortable night 's sleep			1
' i do n't know if it was a false widow or not but the people at the hospital said they had never seen a bite like it before			2
' ms @entity5 is now out of hospital			2
she has been prescribed ten different types of medication			0
they 've inspired terror into millions , sparking complaints that their danger has been over-hyped			0
so what are false widow spiders ? much of their reputation is thought to be thanks to the black widow , which although similarly named is far more dangerous and has been known to kill children , ill or elderly people			1
although its bites can be intensely uncomfortable - swelling hugely when infected - the false widow ( above ) is not known to have caused any deaths in @entity103			0
by comparison , around four @entity103 each year are though to die from bee or wasp stings when they have an allergic reaction			0
false widow spiders are distinctive with their shiny , black flesh , bulbous bodies , thick legs and skull - like patterns			2
millions of false widows , @entity103 's most venomous spider , are found across the @entity103 and the population is growing			0
also known by its @entity120 name @entity119 , its first @entity103 sighting was in @entity121 , @entity122 , in 1879 and is thought to have remained largely in southern @entity123			2
but the @entity124 says warmer summers mean the spider is spreading north , a theory backed by wildlife sightings			0
describing the spider , she said : ' it was a small dark brown or black spider but it was hard to tell because it was night time			2
' i am originally from @entity135 and i have seen all sorts of spiders out there but this is the first in this country			0
you can still see the bite on my leg even now			2
' i think people should be made aware that these spiders are out there in @entity6 and people should be on the lookout			1

as @entity103 's most venomous spider species , false widows made headlines last year when victims told how they had suffered huge wounds and almost lost limbs			0
an entire secondary school was shut in october last year in the @entity171 , @entity172 , after an outbreak of the arachnids in its @entity176 block had to be fumigated			0
in the worst cases , suspected bite victims have been treated in hospital or complained of ongoing health problems several months later			0
but many experts insist the spiders are not particularly dangerous and will only bite if approached or handled			0
there have been no reported deaths from the spiders in @entity103 , where they are believed to have arrived on crates of fruit from the @entity189 in the 1870s			0
it is thought many of the worst reactions happen when bites become infected , rather than being linked to the spider 's venom itself .			0

she rushed to hospital after her leg turned black , yellow and blistered
