great white sharks are feared man eaters - but this monster was in the mood for a spot of cannablism			1
the vicious shark burst from the water to rip into another great white , cementing the giant marine mammal 's reputation as the ocean 's most fearsome predator			1
the sensational moment was caught on camera by 33 - year - old @entity15			2
mr @entity15 had been enjoying the picturesque views off the @entity17 , @entity18 , when a shark measuring 2.6m ate the bait off the side of their boat			1
a split second later a shark double the size broke through the surface of the water and sunk its razor - sharp teeth into its rival 's head - much to the amazement of the people on board the boat			1
he said the trip consisted of two full days of bottom ( 15 - 25m ) diving and surface diving and a day of transit either side			2
' the day where the shark attacked the other was surreal			0
i asked the dive master and skipper of the boat what would happen if a smaller shark got in the way of a larger shark , ' he said			1
' the skipper responded , ' the big shark would take the smaller one down '			0
' literally six seconds later , that amazing scene was witnessed by me , the skipper and the dive master			0
' they had never seen anything like it before			0
i believe that it is extremely rare footage as great whites are elusive and still largely unknown creatures			0
' despite witnessing the brutal attack , mr @entity15 says his diving trip changed his view on sharks			2
' i spent many hours observing them in their territory and up close and saw 18 magnificent creatures in total			0
all of which were inquisitive but not aggressive , ' he said			0
' even when one bumped my hand and camera when i was 20 metres underwater , there was no aggression - just inquisitiveness			0
' @entity53 has since been spotted in the waters around @entity17 - but the smaller shark has not been seen since			1
the skipper said ' the big shark would take the smaller one down ' ' literally six seconds later , that amazing scene was witnessed by me , the skipper and the dive master , ' @entity15 said the huge predator is know to locals as ' @entity53 ' and mr @entity15 had seen him earlier in the day the sensational moment was caught on camera by the 33 - year - old			1
