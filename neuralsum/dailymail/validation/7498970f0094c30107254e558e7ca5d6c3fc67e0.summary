it may only be a throwaway line in a recent patent , but @entity2 has further hinted at plans for a range of electric cars			1
in the patent , called ' @entity7 for inductive charging systems ' , @entity2 details a system of wirelessly charging ' portable electronic devices			1
' and within the list of examples , alongside phones and tablets , is reference to ' electric vehicles '			1
in the patent , ' power management for inductive charging systems ' , @entity2 details a system of wirelessly charging ( illustrated ) ' portable electronic devices			1
' and within the list of examples alongside phones and tablets is reference to ' electric vehicles '			1
this is the only mention of cars in the patent this is the only mention of cars in the patent and it could simply be that @entity2 is hoping its charging technology works with various types of devices			1
but it follows weeks of rumours that the firm is developing a fleet of either electric of self - driving vehicles			1
@entity2 first toyed with an in - car system at its @entity43 in 2013			2
at that point it was known as ' @entity45 ' but following changes in the design team the system was unveiled at last year 's @entity49 , under the moniker @entity45			0
@entity51 used its own annual developer @entity53 in june to unveil @entity55 auto , a key feature of its latest operating system @entity57			0
@entity58 works with any @entity55 @entity60 phone to show information on the dashboard			0
@entity51 has signed up more than 28 car makers including @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 and @entity91			0
the first wave of @entity94 cars are ' coming soon ' - expected to launch this year			0
the first car to be sold with @entity45 was @entity97 's @entity96 in september			0
other partners include @entity64 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity99 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity100 including its @entity102 branch , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity101 , @entity101 , @entity78 , @entity101 , @entity80 , @entity101 , @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity103 , @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity104 , @entity90 and @entity91			0
and by 2016 all new @entity73 models are expected to have @entity58 or @entity45			0
' many electronic devices include one or more rechargeable batteries that require external power to recharge from time to time , said @entity2 in the patent			1
' often , these devices may be charged using the same or similar connection type , for example via usb			0
' however , despite having common connection types , multiple devices often require separate power supplies with different power outputs			2
these separate power supplies are burdensome to use , store , and transport from place to place			0
' @entity2 added that charging cords are unsafe in certain circumstances including when ' a driver of a vehicle may become distracted attempting to plug an electronic device into a vehicle charger			1
' @entity2 's watch is fitted with a form of inductive charging , for example , but the patent takes this technology a step further			1
the tech giant proposes an ' adaptive power control system ' that can detect the weight or ' load ' of the portable device that has been placed on it			2
it will then change the power supply accordingly based on which device is being charged and how much energy it requires			0
recent reports claimed @entity2 has several hundred employees developing its own electric car at a secret lab. speculation was rife last month when an @entity2 - owned car was spotted driving around @entity152 fitted with @entity154 - style cameras			1
further cars were spotted in @entity156 and @entity157			0
if @entity2 was developing such technology , it would would rival @entity51 's self - driving cars			1
@entity51 's head of self - driving cars recently said he expects people to be using them on public roads in two to five years			0

the mention of electric vehicles could simply be reference to the fact @entity2 is hoping its technology works with various devices			1
but it follows weeks of rumours about an @entity2 range of electric self - driving cars @entity190 added the cars would still be test vehicles , and @entity51 would collect data on how they interact with other vehicles and pedestrians			1
similarly , @entity2 is said to be working on a release date of 2020 for its own range of vehicles			2
these reports followed an email from an unnamed @entity2 employee that hinted the firm was developing a vehicle as part of a project that ' will change the landscape and give @entity207 a run for its money			2
' it described ' vehicle development ' at the company but did n't reveal further information			0
in particular , @entity2 may be working on an electric car to rival @entity207 's range or a self - driving car that would ultimately also rival @entity51 's autonomous project			2
the cameras on the mysterious van could be used to scan the road and help engineers develop self - driving software , for example			0

the patent is called ' power management for inductive charging systems '
it details a system of wirelessly charging ' portable electronic devices '
within the list of examples are phones , tablets and ' electric vehicles '
this is the only mention of cars in the patent and it could be that @entity2 is hoping its charging technology works with various types of devices
but it follows weeks of rumours the firm is developing a fleet of cars
