empty desks : businessman @entity0 today slammed ' work shy ' @entity12 after seven of his new recruits failed to turn up to their first day of work yesterday because it was raining mr @entity0 and other staff members called the new employees to ask them where they were			1
initially , some refused to answer their phones when they recognised the number calling them			0
when the staff finally got through , five said they would be better off staying on state benefits rather than doing the commission - based work			1
four of the seven also claimed torrential rain had put them off			0
one was unhappy about the prospect of paying a £ 5 train fare and another called at 12.45pm and said : ' oh , sorry – i overslept			0
