' @entity1 lives matter ' : @entity2 , father of @entity3 , spoke out against the stigma surrounding young black men on @entity6 last night the father of @entity3 , the boy shot dead in @entity9 in 2012 , last night spoke out against the stereotypes that stigmatise young blacks in @entity12			1
speaking about the shooting of @entity14 nine days ago at the hands of a policeman in @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity2 told @entity6 he recognised attempts to smear the dead teenager 's name			1
@entity3 was just 17 when he was killed by neighbourhood watch coordinator @entity22			1
@entity22 was acquitted of second - degree murder after his lawyers painted @entity3 as a dope - smoking , school - skipping delinquent			1
speaking after police in @entity17 released footage of @entity14 allegedly robbing a liquor store , mr @entity3 said : ' you ask yourself as a parent ... is my son on trial or is his killer on trial ? ' ' i 'm seeing the same elements in this case			1
' as he spoke , mr @entity3 's face was etched with sadness despite insisting his family were ' doing well '			1
asked by @entity6 's @entity42 how a solution can by found to the ' alienation ' felt by many in the black community , he said : ' we have to understand that as an @entity1 community our young kids get stereotyped a lot and we have to break the stigma			1
' we have to come together as human beings and say that @entity1 lives matter as much as any other ethnicity group matters			0
' mr @entity3 's comments were a sad reflection of the general opinion of many of the residents of @entity17 , a mainly black suburb of @entity61 , who are increasingly asking questions about whether authorities leading the investigation into @entity14 's death can be trusted to make impartial findings			1
after a week - long crackdown on protests in the town , which have turned violent as police fired rubber bullets and tear gas at demonstrators , the @entity67 reports that grand jurors have begun hearing evidence to help them decide whether @entity17 police officer @entity77 is charged with a state crime for the august 9 killing			1
the @entity80 is conducting a separate civil rights investigation , which could mean there are two decisions about whether to charge @entity77 , who is white			0
the state 's case is being overseen by @entity87 prosecuting attorney @entity86 , who is white , and remains in charge despite mounting pressure to step aside			0
there are some among local residents and black @entity61 area officials who believe mr @entity93 , who has strong links to police , can not be impartial			1
@entity3 was just 17 when he was killed by neighbourhood watch coordinator @entity22			1
@entity22 was acquitted of second - degree murder after his lawyers painted @entity3 as a dope - smoking delinquent representative @entity99 , taking off his jacket to wear a a hoodie and sunglasses as he speaks on the floor of the @entity104 on @entity105 in @entity106 , in march 28 , 2012 , to denounce racial profiling of black people in some other prominent cases — including the killing of @entity3 — special state prosecutors have been appointed to determine whether to pursue charges			1
that sometimes has occurred after the local authorities took no action			0
but under @entity18 law , it ' would be highly , highly , highly unusual ' for a prosecutor to step aside merely because of racial tensions in a high - profile case , said @entity121 , a @entity122 law professor who directs the school 's @entity123			1
that 's because in @entity18 , ' the buck stops with the head prosecutor ' in each county			2
@entity18 law allows two avenues for outside prosecutors			0
the local prosecutor can ask for help from the governor , who can appoint the state attorney general 's office to the case , or a court can appoint a special prosecutor if the elected one has a conflict of interest			2
police shootings do n't automatically qualify as conflicts of interest and often are handled by local prosecutors			0
' just because the case is really hot and really controversial would not be a reason why i would seek a special prosecutor , ' said @entity149 , a @entity150 - area prosecutor who is a past president of the @entity151			2
@entity14 was unarmed when he was shot at least six times by a white police officer in @entity17 , @entity18			1
the killing has sparked more than a week of protests and claims of police institutionalised racism police say @entity14 failed to move out of the centre of the street when @entity77 asked him to , and a scuffle ensued before he was shot			2
witnesses say @entity14 had his hands up as @entity77 fired multiple rounds			0
@entity77 , a six - year police veteran who had no previous complaints against him , has been on paid administrative leave since the shooting and the department has refused to comment on his whereabouts			2
@entity67 reporters have been unable to contact him at any addresses or phone numbers listed under that name in the @entity61 area			2
in the predominantly black suburb of @entity17 , where the shooting occurred , many residents say they have long been harassed and intimidated by the police department , which has just three black officers on its 53 - member force			1
in the immediate aftermath of the shooting , police put the streets of @entity17 on lockdown , calling in reinforcements including armoured vehicles and stalking the streets toting shotguns and sniper rifles in military - style camouflage gear and body armour the scene in @entity17 last night as protesters fled a volley of tear gas fired by police clearing the streets residents have been left furious by the heavy - handed response , and they also have no confidence in mr @entity86 , who has been prosecutor since 1991			1
' he 's not going to prosecute the police officers , ' said @entity204 , a 48 - year - old electrician			2
' in the ghetto ... every police officer , he 's letting go free			2
they call it justifiable homicide			0
' part of the scepticism stems from @entity86 's past			0
he comes from a family of police officers , and when @entity86 was a 12 years old , his father was fatally shot while responding to a call in 1964			2
others point to a 2001 case , where @entity86 brought no charges against two officers who fired 21 shots into a vehicle , killing two black men during an attempted drug arrest			0
a spokesman for mr @entity93 told @entity67 the prosecutor has no plans to step aside from the @entity14 case			1
' the people of this county have placed their trust in me , ' mr @entity86 told tv station @entity233			2
' i 've been as fair and impartial and done as thorough of a job as we could			0
' @entity12 representative @entity236 , @entity61 county executive @entity237 and state senators @entity238 and @entity239 — all of whom are black — have called on mr @entity86 to consent to a special prosecutor			1
ms @entity239 started an online petition and got more than 15,000 signatures within two days seeking a special prosecutor			0
' in the past , justice has not been achieved in these types of police shootings , ' said mr @entity236 , who represents the area			0
' so i have no comfort with local - authority prosecution , the judicial system or even police conducting a thorough and conclusive investigation that delivers justice to family of @entity14			0
' ' simply put : he has a natural bias , ' ms @entity238 , the local state senator , said of mr @entity86			0
' my community does n't trust him			0
' @entity18 does have a recent case in which a special prosecutor took over a highly publicised case , although it was not a racially charged scenario			0
last october , a prosecutor in rural northwest @entity18 asked a judge to appoint a special prosecutor after public concerns that he did n't do enough before dropping felony charges against a teenage boy accused of sexually assaulting a younger girl			0
a judge appointed a @entity150 area prosecutor to take a new look at the case , and @entity275 pleaded guilty in january to misdemeanor child endangerment .			0

@entity2 's son was 17 when he was shot dead by @entity22
in the aftermath of the killing , @entity3 was painted as a delinquent teenager
' our young kids get stereotyped ... we have to break the stigma ' - mr @entity3
@entity17 officials and locals have doubts over @entity61 county prosecutor
they believe @entity93 , who has links to police , can not be impartial
