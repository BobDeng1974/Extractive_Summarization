to his adoring sons , @entity0 was the perfect dad - lavishing them with attention , treating them to trips away and spending every weekend caring for them			1
but behind @entity0 ’ fatherly devotion lay a dark obsession : he was hooked on trawling the web for vile child pornography			1
and when @entity0 ’ hapless family stumbled across his secret , he turned on them in the most cowardly way imaginable – he blamed the stash of obscene images on his own sons			1
traumatised sons ( @entity18 , 25 , left , and @entity19 , 22 , right ) had no choice but to confide in mother , @entity21 , 47 ( centre ) after they made the shocking discovery devastated @entity19 – who has now disowned his dad and even changed his name by deed poll - said : ‘ he may have brought me into this world , but he ’s not my father			1
i hate him for what he ’s put me through – and for what he is			2
’ angry ex @entity21 , 47 , said : ‘ @entity0 denied his guilt to the bitter end and tried to blame anyone and everyone around him – including his own family			1
it ’s cost him everything and every person he was close to			2
’ @entity21 was already a mum to two young boys – @entity18 , 25 , and his older brother , who has asked not to be named – when she met @entity0 more than 20 years ago			1
@entity0 treated the boys as his own and cemented his role as dedicated dad when @entity21 fell pregnant with @entity19 , now 22			1
when their relationship fell apart , @entity0 insisted on staying in touch with the children , and the pair agreed the boys would spend weekends with him			1
@entity21 , from @entity50 in @entity51 , @entity52 , added : ‘ i had no complaints about @entity0 as a father and no qualms about the boys going to stay with him			1
' when they were younger , they 'd sleep over at @entity0 's house and they talked on the phone with him all the time			1
@entity0 pictured with his sons @entity19 ( front ) and @entity18 when they were children ‘ as they got older , they had their own social lives but they always wanted to spend time with @entity0			1
‘ they were great lads and i could see they really benefited from having a father - figure			2
' @entity19 ’s happy memories of weekends at his dad ’s in nearby @entity70 include learning to shoot an air rifle , trips to the cinema and theme park outings			1
‘ nothing was too much trouble , ’ he remembers			2
‘ i ’d stay with dad every weekend until i was about 16 or 17 , and then every couple of weeks after that			2
i ’d go over there after school on friday and come home sunday night			2
‘ i loved him , and i would n’t have done half the things i ’ve done if it had n’t been for him			2
’ but that love was destroyed one night two years ago when @entity19 was confronted by the awful truth that his dad hoarded sick images of child pornography downloaded from the internet			1
@entity19 recalls : ‘ it was late at night and dad had already gone to bed			1
the weather had been rotten all day so we ’d just been chilling at home			2
‘ i was still sat up			2
i ’d downloaded some music and went to burn it onto a cd , but opened the wrong folder by mistake			2
‘ there were hundreds , maybe thousands of images of children in there – nasty stuff , too horrible to describe			1
@entity19 was too horrified to tell his family , carrying the burden of what he had found , and endured three weeks of torment before he finally broke down ‘ i was in total shock , i could n’t believe what i was seeing			1
i felt sick , angry and confused			0
‘ i logged off the computer and tried to sleep – but i could n’t get what i ’d seen out of my head			0
i barely slept a wink that night			0
’ the next morning , @entity19 concealed his horror and spent the rest of the day with his dad before returning home			1
wrestling with his emotions , @entity19 knew he had to share his discovery – but could n’t bring himself to tell his mum what he ’d found			1
and bearing the dreaded burden alone came at an awful cost			0
‘ he was suddenly full of rage , ’ says @entity21			0
‘ he had violent outbursts and fought with his brothers all the time			0
' he refused to talk to me about what was going on and i did n't know what to do			0
' @entity19 admits : ‘ my head was wrecked			1
i just could n’t cope with what i ’d seen , what i ’d found out about my dad , and i went completely off the rails			2
‘ my temper went through the roof , i was horrible to everyone around me – friends , family and colleagues			0
i nearly lost my job because i was so awful to people at work			0
’ after three weeks of torment , @entity19 could no longer bear his secret alone and he finally broke down , revealing all to @entity21			1
‘ i was reading in bed , ’ she says			0
‘ he came in and plonked himself down – he obviously had something he wanted to get off his chest			0
he told me he 'd found things on his dad 's computer , things that were n't very nice			2
' sitting bolt upright , i asked him what he meant , and then he admitted he 'd found pornographic images of children			1
' the conversation was overheard by @entity18 who revealed he , too , had been wrestling with the discovery of vile photos on his dad ’s computer for the past six weeks			1
‘ i was furious he had n’t said anything before , but at the same time relieved i was n’t alone , ’ @entity19 says			1
‘ he ’d felt the same as me – neither of us had been able to tell the other because we did n’t want to believe what we ’d seen with our own eyes			0
’ @entity21 told the boys it was their decision whether to involve the police			0
‘ they would n't tell me exactly what they 'd seen , ’ she remembers			0
they were completely traumatised and refused to talk about it			0
‘ and i had to ask the question no mum ever wants to ask her children : “ were you abused by your dad ? ” ‘ they insisted he ’d never laid a finger on them			2
it was a massive relief but i still felt guilty			0
i wished i had n't let them spend time alone at @entity0 's house			1
i blamed myself for what they 'd been exposed to			2
' hearing the boys give their evidence , finally hearing in awful detail about the vile images they 'd seen , tore me apart ' - @entity21 and the two boys were forced to give evidence in a painful week - long trial ‘ we all knew that reporting the crime would destroy their relationship with their dad forever , and would likely mean both of them having to give evidence against him			2
‘ but they ’re both adults and i had no doubt they ’d make the right choice – it was inevitable that they ’d ask me to call the police			0
’ the boys gave statements and @entity0 , 48 , was arrested			1
computer equipment was seized in a raid on his new home in @entity224 , @entity225			1
the family did n’t think the situation could get any worse – until @entity0 betrayed his sons by blaming them for his vile horde of downloads			1
@entity21 said : ' i could n’t believe he 'd sunk so low			0
the ridiculous accusations destroyed the boys			0
they were both in pieces			0
' i sat down with them and told them that if it came to it , we 'd prove they were telling the truth			0
' @entity19 commented : ‘ the police told us he was trying to pin it on us , and also his own brother			1
i was white with rage when i found out			2
‘ the police looked into his allegations , but they were nonsense – he ’d made some of the files years ago , when i was about nine years old			0
the police knew he was lying			0
’ @entity0 denied all but the family hoped he would face up to what he ’d done and change his plea to guilty			1
instead , he played the legal system for two - and - a - half years before his case finally came to court			0
finally facing justice last month , he forced @entity21 and his sons to give evidence in a week - long trial			2
in a bizarre twist - weekes was also prosecuted for impersonating a police officer after trying to pull over a real cop for speeding			0
@entity19 explained : ‘ when we were young , dad had this odd obsession with the police			1
he had bits of uniform , stab vests , handcuffs and a baton			0
he even had a flashing blue light he ’d stick on the car			0
‘ as kids , we thought it was kind of cool			0
as we got older , we knew it was odd – but as far as we knew he was n’t doing anyone any harm			0
it ’s chilling now to think what he might have been capable of			0
’ @entity0 has since admitted the ruse and received a 12 - month community order the jury heard how nearly 6,000 indecent images were found on a computer and equipment seized from @entity0 ’ home , going back as far as 2003			1
over 22,000 references to the phrase ' pre-teen ' were found on his laptop			1
@entity21 said : ' i thought he 'd at least be man enough to own up to what he 'd done			0
i never thought he 'd make me or the boys take the stand in court			0
' taking the witness stand was the worst thing i 've ever had to do			0
i was shaking like a leaf			0
' and hearing the boys give their evidence , finally hearing in awful detail about the vile images they 'd seen , tore me apart			2
' he was convicted unanimously on one count of possessing thousands of indecent images , another of possessing prohibited images of a child and one of possessing extreme pornographic images			1
he is awaiting sentence at @entity316			1
@entity19 changed his surname from @entity0 to @entity318 last year – and now wants nothing more to do with his father			1
‘ i want everyone to know what he is , ’ says @entity19			1
‘ the more people who know the better			0
he ’s paedophile – and a coward			0

@entity0 , 48 , from @entity224 , @entity52 , was arrested after sons found thousands of ' nasty images ' of children on laptop
@entity0 then blamed sons , @entity19 , 22 , and @entity18 , 25 , of downloading the child porn images , despite the photos dating back to 2003
@entity0 has been convicted and is now awaiting sentence
