work and pensions secretary @entity11 has hammered out details of a new ‘ temperature test ’ that will remove the handout , worth up to £ 300 a year , from such expats			1
in total , it will mean that payments are stopped to 92,983 residents of @entity5 , @entity6 , @entity7 , @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23 , he revealed			0
taxpayers will save almost £ 17million a year			1
almost 100,000 @entity3 pensioners living in warm countries including @entity5 , @entity6 and @entity7 are to lose their winter fuel payments in a crackdown on ' sunshine benefits ' mr @entity11 said countries where the average annual temperature is higher than the warmest region of the @entity3 – the @entity30 at @entity31 ( @entity32 ) – will be affected			1
@entity33 is not included because its northern region has a winter climate colder than that of the @entity37			0
its exclusion means 1,859 @entity3 will still be able to claim the benefit , even if they live in the warmer south			0
there has been increasing controversy over pensioners ’ free tv licences , bus passes and winter fuel payments , with half the @entity48 arguing that they should be reined in if further squeezes on working - age welfare are to be justified			2
work and pensions secretary @entity11 has hammered out details of a new ‘ temperature test ’ that will remove the handout , worth up to £ 300 a year , from such expats			1
but @entity55 pledged at the last election that the payments would be protected until 2015 – and there has been months of wrangling over whether to begin reining them in for expats			2
almost £ 2million goes abroad every week to claimants who still qualify for welfare despite leaving the @entity3			2
traditionally , people were only eligible for the winter fuel payment if they were living in @entity3 at the age of 60 and only moved out later			0
but thanks to a ruling by the @entity68 , the @entity3 would have been forced to pay out to all 444,000 @entity3 pensioners living abroad – costing up to £ 100million a year			1
the court insisted that any elderly expat should be able to get the payment , no matter when they left @entity3			0
there has already been a 13-fold rise in the number of expats claiming in the last decade			2
the biggest expat population is in @entity5 , where 49,443 pensioners are receiving the payment , worth £ 200 for the over- 60s and £ 300 for those over the age of 80 , costing taxpayers £ 8.85million a year			1
but in december and january temperatures in @entity5 can reach @entity86 ( @entity87 )			0
there are almost 28,625 recipients in @entity6 , many of them in the south where temperatures in winter are often a comfortable @entity92 ( @entity93 )			0
controversially , the new regime will mean richer pensioners who have emigrated to colder countries – or warm parts of @entity33 – will continue to receive the payments , while poorer pensioners will lose it if they are in warmer areas			2
in total , it will mean that payments are stopped to 92,983 residents of @entity5 , @entity6 , @entity7 , @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23 , he revealed			0
taxpayers will save almost £ 17million a year mr @entity11 said : ‘ the huge increase in @entity3 winter fuel payments made to people living in @entity112 countries equates to a near doubling in costs to the @entity3 taxpayer and follows a ridiculous ruling by the @entity68			1
‘ the winter fuel payment is intended to help @entity3 pensioners with heating costs			0
from winter 2015/16 , we are changing the rules so that it no longer goes to people in @entity112 countries with an average winter temperature higher than the warmest part of the @entity3			1
’ the number of winter fuel payments made to people in the @entity129 and @entity130 for winter 2012/13 was 119,587 , an increase of 44,901 on 2011/12 .			0
