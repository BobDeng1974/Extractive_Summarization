by @entity0 published : 14:15 est , 22 august 2012 updated : 01:49 est , 23 august 2012 scientists have developed camouflage makeup that not only helps soldiers hide from the enemy , but also shields them from the searing heat of bomb blasts – and it ’s thinner than a sheet of paper			1
the heat - resistant face paint , developed for the @entity11 military , has been described as one of the most fundamental changes in thousands of years to camouflage , and could also benefit fire fighters			1
the material is powerful enough to protect against a thermal blast that can reach 600 degrees @entity18 ( 1,112 degrees @entity19 ) , as hot as a burning cigarette			1
in the near future , camouflage paint could do a lot more than help soldiers hide from their enemies - it could even protect them from bomb blasts ‘ the thermal blast lasts only two seconds , but it can literally cook the face , hands and other exposed skin , ’ said lead scientist dr @entity27 from the @entity28			1
dr @entity27 and colleagues set out to find a material that soldiers could smear on their faces like suntan lotion yet protects against heat far hotter than the rays that normally reach the skin			2
protection : the makeup could help soldiers avoid burns from thermal blasts the formulation they discovered lasts far longer than a normal two second blast , generally providing protection for up to 15 second – and 60 seconds in some tests – before its own temperature rises to the point where a mild burn could occur			0
the finding raises the possibility that other professions exposed to intense heat , such as fire fighters , could also use a colourless version			0
the team had a difficult task in designing the face paint as they could not use traditional makeup ingredients – oil or wax - based face paint – as it can melt on the face and burn the skin when in contact with intense heat			1
so instead they turned to non-flammable silicone			0
blend in : soldiers have used face paint for centuries to shield them from enemies roadside bombs , which have claimed hundreds of lives in @entity74 , @entity75 and other conflicts , produce two blasts			1
firstly , a blast wave at high pressure that spreads out at supersonic speeds and can cause devastating internal injuries			0
secondly , the thermal blast , which follows almost instantaneously and exceeds 600 degrees @entity18			1
the new face paint can provide protection against this second blast			2
the makeup also had to be waterproof and non-irritating , and , in an extra challenge set by military rules , contain the insect repellent @entity90			2
‘ deet also is flammable , so when the @entity94 asked us to incorporate it , we did n't think we could do it , ’ dr @entity27 said			0
their solution was to encapsulate the @entity90 in a water - rich material that prevented it catching fire			0
the team now plans to test the material on other surfaces to see if it can used to protect clothing , tents and other items from burning			0
the study was presented at the annual meeting of the @entity107 .			0

makeup can protect soldiers against intense *explosions* up to 600 degrees @entity18
scientists used silicone so it ca n't melt in high heat
face paint also contains a *mosquito* repellant , is waterproof and non-irritating
