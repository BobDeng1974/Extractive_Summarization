@entity1 is a narcissist whose body language in the days before his wife 's honeymoon murder revealed ' deep tensions ' in their relationship , an expert claimed today			2
analysing cctv footage shown at his murder trial , dr @entity8 claims the pair appeared extremely uncomfortable in each other 's company - from forced embraces to scenes where a ' decidedly unhappy ' @entity18 trails behind her ' uncaring ' new husband			1
' the bottom line , ' she claims			1
' is that he was not in love with her			1
' her comments come a day after it emerged his lawyers said they would apply for all charges against him to be dropped following a succession of prosecution lines collapsing			2
judge @entity32 may rule next week on whether the 34 - year - old businessman has a case to answer about his alleged role in the plot to kidnap and murder his wife			2
dr @entity8 , a behavioural psychologist , also accuses the @entity40 businessman of reacting to news of his bride 's death with an ' awkward ' response			1
here , she gives @entity46 a running commentary of the couple 's demeanour during @entity18 's final hours and @entity1 's behaviour in the days after she was gunned down			1
but the picture also shows ambiguity on her side			2
she walks separately from him : note the distance of her legs from his , but her upper body leans reluctantly and awkwardly towards him			2
it is more likely he is pulling her towards him with some degree of force			2
this is reinforced where he pulls her by the neck for a kiss			2
this motion can be classified as an act of authority : lovers do n't yank their partner 's necks			2
it looks as if there is @entity113 of emotional commitment on his side			2
@entity18 's final hours : @entity1 strides ahead , hands in pockets , towards the @entity119 seafood restaurant , in @entity120 - an unfashionable seaside town in @entity122 - leaving his new bride trailing behind shortly before she was gunned down on their honeymoon in a carjacking allegedly staged by her husband last moments : the awkward body language between the couple is clear even in the grainy @entity61 footage as mrs @entity18 walks several metres behind her new husband with her arms folded the couple make their way towards @entity137 's taxi before the fateful journey where she was shot dead by two gunmen in what the prosecution claim was a hit orchestrated by her husband			1
mrs @entity18 is wearing the short dress and high heels that she was found in the following morning in the back of the abandoned car ' frosty relations ' the loving clip in the street was the night before her death			1
the evening of their outing which led to her death shows a decidedly unhappy @entity18 trailing behind a purposeful @entity18 who strides uncaringly ahead of her			1
this is very much a picture of an unwilling partner			0
in one scene , @entity18 can be seen kissing @entity18 but we already know he is aware of the cameras and looks upward to confirm camera position in another frame			1
he almost throws her off balance and he can be seen to be thrusting his lips on her averted face			1
she avoids making lip - to - lip contact which is a very significant message from a woman on her honeymoon			0
the deep tensions in their relationship are clear			0
the bottom line , he was not in love with her as there was no consistency in his behaviour towards her which shows passion , sexual intimacy , emotional need			1
in @entity61 footage shown at the murder trial , @entity18 is shown being led down the corridor to his hotel room with an arm around his shoulder while he holds his head in his hands , apparently in grief as he arrives at the room door , @entity18 appears to take one hand from his face and reach into his pocket @entity18 then brings his other hand to his pocket , then appears to hand the room key to his companion and walks with him into the room with hands in pockets ' awkward grief ? ' in the hotel corridor where he receives the news of @entity18 's death , he seems awkward in his response and his body movements seem timed and conscious			1
when someone receives bad news a normal response is a gasp for air			1
the mouth falls open with a primitive shock reaction , an adjustment of the reptilian brain			0
his finely gym - toned body appears to be the only real tension on display			0
bicep tension and size does not require effort			0
the human response to bad news is almost foetal with the body musculature collapsing in on itself as energy drains			1
a day after he is seen relaxed and smiling in the same corridor			0
caught on cctv : in one video clip shown to the courtroom , @entity18 is captured leading alleged fixer @entity137 down a hotel corridor to a quiet room , carrying a small bag evidence : the opening shot of the surveillance camera sequence shown to the @entity56 court shows suspect @entity1 walking through the foyer of the @entity73 hotel days after his new wife 's murder waiting : @entity18 is seen pacing back and forth in the hotel lobby in the moments before @entity137 appears follow me : @entity18 leads the way as he takes the cab driver to a part of the hotel not covered by @entity61 ' @entity252 ' in the hotel lounge frame where @entity18 is seen carrying a packet , his shoulders are hunched forward in an expectant position , suggesting purpose in his movement			1
by contrast his grip of the handle of the packet is tight indicating that it has value and can not be lost			0
in body language parlance , this is called field dependence - hinting at gravitas being attached to something external			0
his explanation of a tip ( for the taxi driver ) in a bag is unusual			0
tips are not traditionally given in bags			0
the norm is to hand over notes either opened or in a folded wad			0
suspicions : @entity18 is in a corridor of the hotel , checking his phone and clutching a white carrier bag retail therapy : the bag is from a shopping trip to the nearby @entity288			1
the @entity289 heard @entity18 chose to shop for greetings cards instead of attending a @entity292 ceremony to bless his wife 's body shopping spree the retail therapy pic shows anything but grief			1
his body style is relaxed and confident			0
this is the real @entity18			1
@entity1 ( left ) arrives with supporters for his extradition hearing at @entity305 in may 2011 then leaves ( right ) after being excused because of ill health ' @entity307 ' early footage of the good - looking @entity18 shows his preoccupation with his image projection and he walks with the confident glide of a fashion model for @entity313			1
there is an enduring trend of dapper dressing , sleek tailored attire and labels			0
his clothing fits his lean body suggesting that shopping is more than an outing			0
soft boyish features and sensuous lips contrasted against a muscular well - toned body complete the picture			1
@entity40 courts are defined by respectful behaviour and dignified dress , the latter idea of which seems to have eluded @entity18 as he arrives for extradition court hearings looking unkempt , eyes cast down , feet shod in trainers , dragging on the ground			1
unpressed jeans or track suit pants are de rigeur as is his unshaven face and bomber jackets			2
this look fits appropriately into the depressed post-traumatic stress image he projected			0
but narcissism does out through the contrasting designer hairstyle and well - manicured slim hands			0
@entity1 sits in the dock before the start of his trial at the @entity352 last month attention to detail in the court room we see his unfailing attention to detail and his image with his sartorial elegance			0
his suit , shirt and tie are immaculate as is his designer hairstyle			0
only the frightened , wide alertness of his eyes as they dart with involuntary speed around the court to take in as much information as possible is the giveaway			0
his breathing is shallow supporting the element of fear			0
salacious information of his other life ( with gay prostitutes ) confirms his ability to project an image on command			0
he probably has endured a lifetime of living this double life so changing face chameleon style is not alien to him			2
