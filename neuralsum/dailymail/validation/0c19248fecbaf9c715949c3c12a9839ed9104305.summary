while @entity2 players are determined to give @entity3 a perfect send off to his @entity5 career by winning the @entity6 , there is a growing confidence within the camp there will be life after the iconic captain			1
@entity2 have won all six of the games that @entity3 has missed with a hamstring injury and the 3 - 4 - 3 formation used by @entity16 has made them look more like the vibrant side that chased @entity18 for the @entity20 title last season			1
they have gone from mid-table to genuine @entity24 hopefuls as a result			2
@entity3 has been back in training ahead of @entity2 's @entity6 quarter - final against @entity28 @entity2 have won all six of the games that captain @entity3 has missed with a hamstring injury @entity2 full back @entity32 ( right ) believes the team can win the @entity6 for departing skipper @entity3 @entity3 is in contention to return for sunday 's @entity6 quarter - final against @entity28 but may find it hard to force his way back into the starting line - up			1
this season 's @entity6 final takes place on his 35th birthday and would be his final match for the club before he joins @entity46			1
' it 's always sad when someone is injured , you do n't wish that on anybody			0
but i think it is good that we have proved we can succeed without @entity3 , ' said @entity32 , a Â£ 12million summer signing from @entity55 and a key member of the new - look side @entity16 is trying to assemble			1
' we 've moved up the table and been winning matches			0
it shows that within this squad there are some top , top players to replace even the likes of @entity3 , ' said @entity32 , a left - back who has been pushed further forward into midfield in recent weeks			1
' whoever is injured , the player who comes into replace them puts themself on the line for the @entity2 cause			2
the morale and dynamic of the group has been very good			0
we 're playing well and we 've proved we can carry on without him			0
' i think the new system we are playing has helped us intensify our play even more			0
it allows us to get lots of bodies forward when we are attacking , but we are safe in the knowledge of having three centre - backs covering as well as the two deep - lying midfielders			2
' if we need to lend a hand as well , the wing - backs you can call them , we can drop back and support as well as get forward and support the attack			2
' you have to point to the fact we have picked up a lot of victories and points since the system changed , and i guess it does allow us to be a little bit more intense			0
but it was n't as if we were n't trying to play with intensity before , we were just inconsistent and dropped points we should n't have done			0
' of course , @entity32 is not dismissing the contribution of @entity3 to @entity2 over the years , and is using the captain 's impending departure as an extra incentive to lift a trophy			1
fresh from @entity55 , where he won the @entity109 last season , the energetic 22 - year - old is almost in awe of @entity3			1
@entity32 ( centre ) believes @entity6 glory would be a perfect way for @entity3 to finish his time at @entity2 @entity3 ( left ) sustained his hamstring injury in @entity2 's 3 - 2 victory over @entity118 at @entity5 last month @entity3 ( left ) has lifted the @entity6 twice before as a @entity2 player and is eager to win it one more time ' it will stick in my memory that i 've had a chance to play and train with one of the best players in the world , ' he says			1
' the @entity127 have a word ' crack ' to describe a big star , ' @entity126 ' means megastar and that is @entity3			2
i have watched him play since i was a boy and now i 've had the fortune to not just share a dressing room with him , but to train and play alongside him			0
he was one of my idols growing up			0
' to win the @entity6 would be the perfect present for him , would n't it ? to be able to leave the club with a trophy under his belt , that would be fantastic for @entity3			1
but not just for him , it would be a great thing for the team and for the fans as well			0
