@entity0 suffered a bloody nose over his @entity3 reforms yesterday , losing a surprise vote in the @entity5 as senior ministers urged him to drop the @entity7 altogether			2
@entity8 passed an amendment to the legislation demanding more money for mental health services by 244 votes to 240 – with three @entity15 rebels voting against the government			1
the @entity7 had already been mauled in the @entity5 , with the government tabling 137 amendments to it last week to appease the @entity15			1
whoa ! @entity0 took a battering at @entity22 over the controversial @entity3 bill , with @entity24 ( right ) urging a u-turn , and the prime minister was later handed another embarrassing defeat by the @entity5 over mental health changes yesterday , before the defeat , the prime minister had earlier offered only lukewarm support to his embattled health secretary @entity32 in riposte to an attack by @entity35 leader @entity24 , saying : ‘ the career prospects for my right honourable friend ( mr @entity32 ) are a lot better than his			1
’ insiders still expect mr @entity32 to be moved at the next reshuffle after briefings from @entity43 insiders that they want him ‘ taken out and shot ’ for his failure to sell the reforms to a sceptical public			2
@entity3 reform : the proposed changes a senior minister said that disquiet is so advanced in @entity53 ranks that @entity55 members had urged mr @entity0 to drop the @entity7 in recent weeks			0
the @entity57 @entity56 today became the latest in a string of professional healthcare bodies to call for the @entity7 to be scrapped			0
a survey of members found that 93 per cent believed the @entity7 would damage the @entity3 and the health of people in @entity63 and three - quarters wanted the @entity65 to demand its withdrawal			2
faculty president professor @entity67 said : ' we are now calling on the government to withdraw the @entity7 in its entirety , because it would be in the best interests of everyone 's health			1
' our 3,300 members - experts in planning and providing for people 's health - have been closely involved in trying to make the government 's proposed reforms work since they were first introduced			1
' based on our members ' expert views , it has become increasingly clear that the @entity7 will lead to a disorganised @entity3 with increased health inequalities , more bureaucracy and wasted public funds			2
' @entity85 will increase health inequalities because there is the real danger that vulnerable groups like homeless people will not be included when health services are being planned			2
clinical commissioning groups and service providers will be able to pick and choose what procedures they perform and which services they put in place			0
' the @entity65 voiced concerns about how emergency planning , screening and immunisation services will work under the @entity7 , which it said would leave the @entity3 with a shortage of strategic leadership and a lack of clarity about what happens if a private provider goes bankrupt			0
sources close to the prime minister denied that he ever considered that option but the minister said : ‘ there is a case for abandoning the whole thing			0
’ @entity53 strategists fear that mr @entity32 ’s failure to win over doctors or patients to his reforms will be used by @entity35 as a political battering ram			0
‘ no @entity53 mp knows what the point of these reforms is any more , ’ one @entity53 mp said			0
‘ i would be surprised if @entity32 was still here in a year			0
’ senior sources talked down the defeat in the @entity5 , pointing out that the mental health amendment was more a technical disagreement than a fundamental challenge to the principles of the @entity7			1
but one source predicted a ‘ few bloody noses ’ as the @entity7 continues its passage through the @entity5			0
in the @entity135 mr @entity24 said the @entity7 would introduce the biggest shake - up since the founding of the @entity3 in 1948 and would put gps in control of much of the @entity3 budget			1
‘ this is a matter of trust in the prime minister , ’ mr @entity24 told mps			1
‘ can he honestly look people in the @entity145 in the eye and say he ’s kept his promise of no more top - down reorganisation ? ‘ he knows in his heart of hearts that this is a complete disaster			1
‘ the reality about this @entity7 is this : the doctors know it ’s bad for the @entity3 , the nurses know it ’s bad for the @entity3 and patients know it ’s bad for the @entity3			0
’ mr @entity0 hit back , saying that the @entity3 in @entity63 under the @entity157 is doing better than @entity158 ’s @entity145 , which is run by @entity35 and has been subjected to £ 400million in spending cuts			0
he also accused mr @entity24 of using the furore over the @entity7 to boost his personal standing with his party , saying : ‘ this is not a campaign to save the @entity3 , this is a campaign to try and save your leadership			1
