by @entity1 reporter we may feel like we are in our peak in our twenties – but scientists believe our brains start going downhill after the age of 24			0
researchers used computer games as a way of testing our ability to process ­ information and react to it – known as ­ ‘ cognitive motor skills ’			1
the study involved more than 3,300 people aged 16 to 44 playing a space battle and ­ trading game called @entity19 according to new research , the human brain may start to decline at the age of just 24 in the game , players can buy and sell spaceships , upgrade their weapons and trade with or wage war on fellow players			0
the study revealed a link between age and being slower at the game			0
researchers said that those over the age of 24 tended to ­ perform less well			1
lead author @entity34 , a phd student from @entity35 in @entity36 , said : ‘ after around 24 years of age , players show slowing in a measure of cognitive speed that is known to be important for performance			1
although older players are less able to react quickly , researchers say cognitive motor capacities change throughout adulthood ‘ this cognitive performance decline is present even at higher levels of skill			1
’ although older players are less able to react quickly , they do have some advantages on their younger competitors			2
‘ our research tells a new story about human development , ’ said mr @entity34			0
‘ older players , though slower , seem to ­ compensate by employing simpler strategies and using the game ’s interface more ­ efficiently than younger players , enabling them to retain their skill , despite cognitive motor - speed loss			1
’ he said older players , for example , are ­ better at using keyboard shortcuts to help them make up for declining speed			2
and there is some hope for those of us over the age of 24 as mr @entity34 said that our cognitive motor capacities change throughout adulthood			2
‘ they are constantly in flux and our day - to - day performance is a result of the constant interplay between change and adaptation , ’ he added			0
the study was published in the journal @entity79 .			0

researchers in @entity36 used computer games to test cognitive motor skills
those over 24 tended to perform less well revealing link between age and speed
but older players were better at employing new strategies such as shortcuts
