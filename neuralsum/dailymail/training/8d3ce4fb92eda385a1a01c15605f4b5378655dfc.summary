by @entity0 published : 15:26 est , 22 august 2012 updated : 01:56 est , 23 august 2012 as far as armed robbers go , @entity1 will not be remembered as a criminal mastermind			1
in what can only be described as a farcical raid on a corner shop , he failed to ensure he had a foolproof disguise and a meticulously planned gateway			0
for starters , he brandished a toy gun			0
then , the dopey 28 - year - old unveiled his disguise by whipping off his balaclava in full view of the shop 's cctv camera			1
and that was before things went from bad to worse , as he struggled to exit via the one - way door			0
scroll down to watch the @entity15 ! @entity1 demands cash from the woman behind the till : he does n't take very much of it though he may as well have not worn the balaclava : not long after this scene is filmed @entity1 takes it off in full view of @entity15 not only did staff know him as a regular customer , he had also robbed the place just 10 days earlier			1
@entity1 's embarrassing catalogue of errors started shortly after he burst into @entity34 's newsagent in @entity35 , @entity36 , waving the plastic gun			2
amazingly , in the pantomime - style raid , he did manage to grab £ 134.98 from the till			1
as he attempted to leave the shop , @entity1 , who was pushing instead of pulling the door , then attempted to kick out the glass panel but toppled backwards into a drinks display , sending bottles skidding across the floor			1
baffled store manager @entity47 , keen to see the back of him , even went to his aid and helped him leave the store on march 2 this year			0
@entity1 was picked up by police just three hours after his botched robbery , still on the same street and with his balaclava stuffed in his pocket			2
when bundled into the police car he burst into tears and said to officers , ' i 'm sorry , it 's not fair on them - are they all right ? ' @entity1 was jailed for three years for this offence last month but new details can only now be released after he was sentenced at @entity64 for the earlier raid on the same shop			1
the first robbery took place just before 6pm on february 23 , when supervisor @entity69 was preparing to close the store			0
what a plonker ! @entity1 topples backwards into a drinks display after failing to get out of the door flustered he removes the balaclava in full view of cameras in the shop this time wearing a balaclava for the entirety of the robbery , @entity1 repeatedly shouted ' give me the money ' while holding an object in a green case as if it were a gun , the judge heard			1
@entity1 forced her to hand over £ 360 pounds			2
@entity86 , defending , said his client was a hard - working dental nurse until three years ago when his fiancee left him and he turned to @entity90 drugs			0
judge @entity91 did not extend @entity1 's existing three - year sentence			2
last night detective chief inspector @entity93 said : ' clearly @entity1 's actions show that he is n't cut out for a career in crime , due to the way in which he was apprehended			0
' he now has time to think about these actions while serving his sentence in prison			0

staff at the shop knew bungling robber @entity1 , 28 , as a regular customer
as he attempted to leave the shop he fell over and shop assistant went to help him
he managed to steal £ *138.98* from the till - and had robbed the place 10 days before
