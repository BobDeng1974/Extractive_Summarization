the @entity0 has curbed spying on friendly governments in @entity3 in response to the furor over a @entity6 caught selling secrets to the @entity8 and the @entity10 revelations of classified information held by the @entity12 , according to current and former @entity8 officials			1
the pause in decades of espionage , which remains partially in effect , was designed to give @entity0 officers time to examine whether they were being careful enough and to evaluate whether spying on allies is worth running the risk of discovery , said a @entity8 official who has been briefed on the situation			0
under the stand - down order , case officers in @entity3 largely have been forbidden from undertaking ' unilateral operations ' such as meeting with sources they have recruited within allied governments			1
such clandestine meetings are the bedrock of spying			0
among his revelations , he revealed that the @entity8 had tapped the phone of @entity6 leader @entity38 , causing tension between the two countries @entity0 officers are still allowed to meet with their counterparts in the host country 's intelligence service , conduct joint operations with host country services and conduct operations with the approval of the host government			1
recently , unilateral operations targeting third country nationals , @entity35 in @entity51 , for example , were restarted			2
but most meetings with sources who are host nationals remain on hold , as do new recruitments			0
the @entity0 declined to comment			0
@entity58 , the @entity8 director of national intelligence , said during a public event on thursday that the @entity8 is assuming more risk because it has stopped spying on ' specific targets , ' though he did n't spell out details			0
spying stand - downs are common after an operation is compromised , but ' never this long or this deep , ' said a former @entity0 official , who , like others interviewed for this story , spoke on condition of anonymity because it 's illegal to discuss classified material or activities			2
@entity12 leaks revealed that the @entity8 agency had tapped @entity6 leader @entity38 's phone , making for an awkward exchange with president @entity78 the pause , which has been in effect for about two months , was ordered by senior @entity0 officials through secret cables			1
the current stand - down was part of the fallout from the july 2 arrest of a 31 - year - old employee of the @entity6 intelligence service			1
suspected of spying for @entity35 , he told authorities he passed 218 @entity6 intelligence documents to the @entity0			1
in a second case , authorities searched the home and office of a @entity6 defense official suspected of spying for the @entity8 , but he denied doing so , and no charges have been filed against him			2
a few days later , @entity6 asked the @entity0 station chief in @entity98 to leave the country , an unprecedented demand from a @entity8 ally			2
the move demonstrated how seriously the @entity6 were taking the situation , having already been stung by revelations made by @entity10 , a former @entity12 systems administrator , that the agency had tapped @entity6 chancellor @entity38 's mobile phone			1
the @entity12 disclosure infuriated @entity38 , who demanded explanations from president @entity78			2
it embarrassed both world leaders and has left many @entity6 skeptical about cooperating with the @entity8 @entity0 managers were worried that the incident could lead @entity3 security services to begin closely watching @entity0 personnel			1
many agency officers in @entity3 , operating out of @entity8 embassies , have declared their status as intelligence operatives to the host country			2
the spying stand - down comes at an inopportune time , with the @entity8 worried about @entity130 extremists going to fight in @entity131 , @entity3 's response to @entity35 aggression and @entity3 hostility to @entity8 technology companies following revelations the companies turned over data to the @entity12			1
while the @entity8 cooperates closely with @entity3 against terrorism , spying can help @entity8 officials understand what their allies are planning and thinking , whether about counterterrorism or trade talks			0
the ' eur ' division , as it is known within the @entity0 , covers @entity141 , @entity3 and @entity142			0
while spying on @entity3 allies is not a top priority , @entity142 is considered a high priority target â€” an @entity147 country that talks to @entity8 adversaries such as @entity149 , while sharing a border with @entity131 and @entity151			0
it was not known to what extent the stand - down affected operations in @entity142			0
@entity3 countries also are used as safe venues to conduct meetings between @entity0 officers and their sources from the @entity161 and other high priority areas			1
those meetings have been rerouted to other locales while the pause is in place			0
the @entity169 staff has long been considered among the most risk - averse in the agency , several former case officers said , speaking on condition of anonymity because they were n't authorized to discuss secret intelligence matters by name			1
a former @entity0 officer who worked under non-official cover wrote a 2008 book in which he described a number of operational ' stand - downs , ' in @entity3 , including one in @entity51 in 1998 because of the @entity182 soccer championship , and another in a @entity3 country in 2005 , in response to unspecified security threats			1
the former officer , whose true name has not been made public , wrote ' @entity188 : inside the @entity0 's @entity191 , ' under a pseudonym , @entity189			0
he is a @entity192 who served 15 years in the agency before resigning in 2006			0
the @entity0 acknowledged his status as a case officer when it successfully sued him for publishing the book without first submitting it for pre-publication censorship , as he was required to do under his secrecy agreement			0
the @entity0 last faced that sort of blowback from a @entity3 ally in 1996 , when several of its officers were ordered to leave @entity51			1
an operation to uncover @entity51 positions on world trade talks was unraveled by @entity51 authorities because of poor @entity0 tactics , according to a secret @entity0 inspector general report , details of which were leaked to reporters			0
the @entity215 flap left the @entity217 division much less willing to mount risky espionage operations , many former case officers have said .			2
