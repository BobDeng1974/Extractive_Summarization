by @entity0 published : 06:54 est , 12 june 2012 updated : 07:21 est , 13 june 2012 @entity3 will find it almost ‘ impossible ’ to fight simultaneous wars after dramatic cuts to the @entity6 , the former head of the @entity2 warned yesterday			1
lord @entity7 said it was a ‘ risky ’ policy to slash the numbers of service personnel to their lowest levels for more than a century in a bid to cut costs			1
his comment came as 3,800 members of the @entity6 were yesterday given redundancy letters			1
lord @entity7 said it was a ' risky ' policy to slash troop numbers some 2,900 soldiers received their notice			2
a total of 170 sailors and 730 @entity25 personnel were also made redundant			2
the @entity2 is facing another wave of severe cuts as early as next year to bring numbers down from their current level of 97,000 to 82,000 – its smallest size since the @entity32 at the end of the @entity34			1
former @entity2 chief general sir @entity7 , now @entity7 , warned : ‘ in future we wo n’t be able to do the kind of things we have done on the scale we have done them in the past			1
that ’s fine as long as the next decade is more peaceful			2
’ defence secretary @entity43 said fewer than anticipated were being axed from the @entity44 and the @entity25 asked whether @entity3 could fight simultaneous wars like it did in @entity46 and @entity47 , lord @entity7 told the @entity48 : ‘ it will be very difficult , verging on the impossible to do that when the @entity2 is down to 82,000 by 2020			1
‘ i know the policy is to rely very much more heavily on the reserves and that policy could work but it ’s a risky policy and it ’s unproven			0
i ’m not saying what the government is doing is wrong , but there are risks			0
’ defence secretary @entity43 said the cuts were regrettable , but necessary to plug a ‘ multi-billion pound black hole in the defence budget ’ left by the @entity62 government			0
mr @entity43 said : ' of course i regret that it has been necessary to make redundancies to deliver our plans for reducing the size of the armed forces			2
' we ’ve now brought the defence budget back into balance for the first time in a generation			0
' we will have smaller armed forces but we will ensure they will have the protection and equipment they need			0
mr @entity43 meeting members of the @entity79 at @entity80 in @entity47 today			0
the @entity81 is trying to reduce the size of the @entity2 to 82,000 ' the @entity44 and @entity25 redundancy figures are smaller than anticipated due to the @entity81 ’s ability to use other measures , such as slowing recruitment			1
' no further significant reductions are expected for the @entity44 or @entity25			0
we still have some way to go to bring the size of the @entity2 down to 82,000 and decisions on what is necessary to achieve this are yet to be taken , but we wo n’t compromise the mission in @entity47			1
' but shadow defence secretary @entity94 said : ‘ savings have to be made , but we worry important skills and capabilities are being lost without thought for our forces ’ role in the world			0

there are 3,800 redundancies in total and 30 per cent are *compulsory*
2,900 losses will come from the @entity2 which is facing *biggest* manpower cut
@entity81 says there *'s* still a way to go to reduce @entity2 to 82,000
