a novice treasure hunter who bought a basic metal detector returned to the shop in shock weeks later , clutching part of the country 's finest ever hoard of @entity8 gold coins			1
the man stunned staff by showing them 40 gold @entity12 , before asking them : ' what do i do with this ? ' they contacted local experts and together got the permits they needed , headed back to the scene and pulled up another 119 gleaming pieces			1
the hoard could be worth more £ 100,000			2
these late @entity8 gold coins were been found by a metal detectorist on private land north of @entity27 in @entity28			1
the find is believed to be one of the largest roman gold coin hoards ever discovered in the @entity32 @entity33 , the lucky shopkeeper who joined the second search party , said : ' it ’s a staggering thing			1
' we sold this guy an entry - level machine and he went off and pulled off one of the largest ever hoards of @entity8 gold coins			1
we believe it ’s the second largest			2
' he came up with approximately 40 coins to start with			1
he came to see us and we looked at it and thought : ‘ is this a stunt ? ’ ' i ’ve heard in the past that the general reaction with things like this is that people are terrified			2
they do n’t know what they ( the artefacts ) mean			0
' they advised the man to get in touch with the local finds liaison officer and armed with a @entity60 they went to the woodlands spot near @entity27 , @entity28 , and continued the work			1
mr @entity33 , who founded metal detecting shop @entity64 with @entity66 in @entity67 , @entity28 , last year , said : ' we went with them and took with us a couple of slightly more potent machines and we pulled 119 more coins out of the ground			1
' these are 22 carat gold , they have n’t got any damage and they came out of the ground looking like the day they were made			0
all i can say is i was there and my heart was going at 10 to the dozen			0
' the find has been referred to experts at the @entity87 to investigate and prepare a report for the local coroner the man had bought a @entity91 150 , retailing at around £ 135 and described as being ideal for children to use for a hobby			1
local heritage officials described the find as ' a nationally significant find			0
' the coins are a rare example of the @entity12 , dating from the last days of @entity8 rule in @entity32			1
the last consignments of them reached these shores in @entity103			0
officials refused to identify the exact site of the discovery or the landowner to stop others from trying to cash in			0
they also would not name the person who found them , who could profit from a share of the proceeds from the coins			1
a spokesman for @entity115 and @entity116 said : ' a nationally significant find of 159 @entity119 gold coins has been found by a metal detectorist on private land in the north of the district of @entity27 , in @entity28			1
' i 've found bits and pieces but nothing like this			0
i 've got immense satisfaction that the guy came to us and bought the machine from us but i would be lying if i said i did n't wish it had been me			1
' shopkeeper @entity33 ' the find is believed to be one of the largest roman gold coin hoards ever discovered in the @entity32			1
' local museum staff , together with @entity64 , travelled to the rural site to confirm the find			1
' evidence suggests that the hoard was disturbed in the last couple of hundred years due to quarrying activity or plough action , ' said the spokesman			0
mr @entity33 said the coins were found across about 15 metres of woodland			1
it is believed that the area was used during the @entity149 to cultivate crops and it may be then that the coins were shifted			2
' the interesting thing is there were no other artefacts there at all , no brooches , ' said mr @entity33			0
' oddly there was no vessel at all to hold them			0
it is quite a significant stash and i ’m surprised that it would have been in an organic holder			0
the council has now referred the hoard to experts at the @entity87 to investigate and prepare a report for the local coroner			1
they will also determine the value of the coins , which could fetch anything from £ 400 to £ 1,000 apiece			2
the coroner will then determine whether the hoard counts as treasure			2
@entity175 , curator of the prehistory to medieval section at the @entity178 , in @entity27 , said : ' @entity179 were extremely valuable coins and were not traded or exchanged on a regular basis			2
' they would have been used for large transactions such as buying land , or goods by the shipload			0
' the gold coins in the economy guaranteed the value of all the silver and especially the bronze coins in circulation			2
however , must people would not have had regular access to them			0
' typically , the wealthy @entity8 elite , merchants or soldiers receiving bulk pay were the recipients			0
' mr @entity33 , who resumed detecting three years ago after a 36 - year gap , has himself found a number of items , including a rare silver @entity204			0
he said : ' i ’ve found bits and pieces but nothing like this			0
i ’ve got immense satisfaction that the guy came to us and bought the machine from us but i would be lying if i said i did n’t wish it had been me			2
thanks to things like @entity221 people ’s interest in archaeology has really taken off			0
you do have the possibility to change history			0
