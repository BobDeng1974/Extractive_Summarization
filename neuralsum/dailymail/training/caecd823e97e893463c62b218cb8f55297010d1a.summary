homosexuality is passed down through the generations from mother to son and from father to daughter , a new study claims			1
from an evolutionary standpoint , homosexuality is a trait that would not be expected to develop and persist in the face of @entity11 natural selection			1
it is nevertheless common for men and women in most cultures and previous studies have shown that homosexuality runs in families , leading most researchers to presume a genetic underpinning of sexual preference			1
puzzle : scientists had long puzzled over why homosexuality appears to run in families when as a genetic trait it would not be expected to develop and persist in the face of @entity11 natural selection however , no major gene for homosexuality has been found despite numerous studies searching for a genetic connection			1
now in a study published yesterday in the @entity33 , researchers from the @entity31 suggest homosexuality has an epigenetic link , not a genetic one			1
epigenetics explains how gene expression is regulated by temporary switches , called epi - marks			0
these constitute an extra layer of information attached to our genes ' backbones that determine their effect on our development			0
while genes hold the instructions , epi - marks direct how those instructions are carried out – when , where and how much a gene is expressed during development			0
gay marriage : a study suggests homosexuality has an epigenetic link , not a genetic one , allowing it to confound the usual rules of evolution epi - marks are usually produced anew each generation , but recent evidence demonstrates that they sometimes carryover between generations and thus can contribute to similarity among relatives , resembling the effect of shared genes			1
@entity69 , an an evolutionary biologist at the @entity70 and lead author of the study , says epi - marks can determine the development of homosexuality in the offspring of heterosexual parents			2
' there is compelling evidence that epi - marks contribute to both the similarity and dissimilarity of family members , and can therefore feasibly contribute to the observed familial inheritance of homosexuality and its low concordance between [ identical ] twins , ' he told @entity86			2
dr @entity69 and his team integrated evolutionary theory with recent advances in the molecular regulation of gene expression and androgen - dependent sexual development to produce a biological and mathematical model that delineates the role of epigenetics in homosexuality			0
sex - specific epi - marks produced in early foetal development protect each sex from the substantial natural variation in testosterone that occurs during later foetal development , the researchers say			2
sex - specific epi - marks stop girl foetuses from being masculinised when they experience atypically high testosterone , and vice versa for boy foetuses			0
different epi - marks protect different sex - specific traits from being masculinised or feminised – some affect the genitals , others sexual identity , and yet others affect sexual partner preference			0
however , when these epi - marks are transmitted across generations from fathers to daughters or mothers to sons , they may cause reversed effects , such as the feminisation of some traits in sons , such as sexual preference , and similarly a partial masculinisation of daughters			0
the study solves the evolutionary riddle of homosexuality , finding that ' sexually antagonistic ' epi - marks , which normally protect parents from natural variation in sex hormone levels during foetal development , sometimes carry over across generations and cause homosexuality in opposite - sex offspring			1
the mathematical modeling demonstrates that genes coding for these epi - marks can easily spread in the population because they always increase the fitness of the parent but only rarely escape erasure and reduce fitness in offspring			0
' transmission of sexually antagonistic epi - marks between generations is the most plausible evolutionary mechanism of the phenomenon of human homosexuality , ' said study co-author @entity154 , a professor at the @entity155 .			2

new study answers puzzle of why homosexuality seems to run in families
it would not be expected to persist given @entity11 natural selection
researchers show it is an epigenetic rather than a genetic trait
