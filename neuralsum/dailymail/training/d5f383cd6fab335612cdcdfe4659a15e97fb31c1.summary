by @entity0 published : 02:58 est , 20 february 2013 updated : 03:20 est , 20 february 2013 red squirrels could make a comeback in the @entity4 countryside thanks to the pine marten , which preys on their grey cousins			1
the hard - up animals are much faster than grey squirrels , allowing the ferret - like pine martens to feast on them more easily			1
since the introduction of grey squirrels from @entity16 in the 19th century , huge numbers of reds have been wiped out across @entity4 due to competition			2
@entity18 : a study by the @entity20 found that rising numbers of pine martens led to a decrease in grey squirrels , allowing red squirrels to flourish there are currently between 120,000 and 140,000 red squirrels in the @entity28 compared to over four million grey squirrels			1
but a study in @entity31 found that rising numbers of pine martens has led to a decrease in grey squirrel numbers , once again allowing reds to thrive			1
since receiving protection under the @entity39 in 1976 , the country 's pine marten population has grown , but the animal is uncommon in @entity4			0
experts say that if the little - known creature is introduced it could lead to a swell in red squirrel numbers on these shores			0
the study by the @entity20 found that red squirrels were spotted in areas where pine martens flourish			1
researchers studied pine marten faeces which showed the animals regularly ate grey squirrels but hardly any reds			1
competition : since the introduction of grey squirrels from @entity16 in the 19th century , huge numbers of reds have been wiped out across @entity4 due to competition reintroduction : experts say introducing the pine marten , which hunts grey squirrels more easily , could lead to a rise in the red squirrel population this is because reds spend most of their time in trees and are smaller and more agile than their relatives			1
the latest figures suggest there are as few as 120 pine martens , who also eat field voles , small birds , wood mice and frogs , left in @entity4 and @entity78			1
@entity79 has around 3,500 , having been granted protection in 1987 , and is also home to about 75 per cent of the @entity28 red squirrel population			0
@entity83 : red squirrels spend most of their time in trees and are smaller and more agile than their grey relatives belonging to the mustelid family , which also includes minks , otters , badgers , wolverines and weasels , the pine marten is about the size of a domestic cat			2
dr @entity97 , lecturer in zoology at the @entity20 , said : ' the reason reds have disappeared throughout @entity101 and @entity31 is because of the competition from the greys			0
' but what we have seen here is when there are higher numbers of pine martens in an area the number of greys go down , as pine marten eat the greys			2
' @entity115 and pine martens have lived together for thousands of years and have existed together quite happily			0
' a possible conservation tool could be to introduce more pine martens to return the reds ( in @entity4 ) to their former glory			2
' @entity121 , director of the @entity122 , welcomed the results , saying : ' to have a natural predator for greys would really help but there would be an awful lot of people not happy with the introduction of pine martens into the countryside			0
' @entity132 , project support officer at the @entity133 , which studies pine martens , said : ' it 's great that pine martens are recovering and if their recovery has a positive impact on the red squirrel that is really good news			0
' @entity142 martens are native to all of @entity101 and in areas where they are absent their absence has an effect on that eco-system - there is less pressure on the grey squirrels , they flourish and make life harder for the red squirrel			0

the predators can hunt grey squirrels more easily facilitating red cousins
@entity20 study found reds in pine marten populated areas
experts say that pine martens could be introduced to help red squirrels
currently only 120 pine martens in @entity4 but many more in @entity79 and @entity31 where they are protected
