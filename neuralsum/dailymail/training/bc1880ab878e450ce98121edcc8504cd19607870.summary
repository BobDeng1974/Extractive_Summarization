the @entity2 has released an official statement arguing that man - made global warming is real , just days its co-founder said it does not exist			1
the group claims said the planet is ' indeed warming , ' with temperatures increasing 1 to 1.5 degrees fahrenheit ( 0.6 ° c to 0.9 ° c ) in the last 100 years			1
the @entity10 - based channel also states humans are helping make the planet warmer as a result of burning of fossil fuels and deforestation			1
in a letter attacking the @entity22 , the 80 - year - old from @entity24 , said that what ' little evidence ' there is for global warming points to natural cycles in temperature ' potential outcomes range from moderate and manageable to extreme and catastrophic , ' it said in its statement			1
' impacts can already be seen , especially in the @entity37 , with melting glaciers , thawing permafrost , and rapid retreat and thinning of sea ice , all of which are affecting human populations as well as animals and vegetation			0
' there and elsewhere , rising sea level is increasing coastal vulnerability			0
' ' the bottom line is that with the rate of greenhouse gas emissions increasing , a significant warming trend is expected to also continue , ' it added			2
@entity20 ( left ) , is pictured here in 1981 as @entity56 's @entity55 ' meteorologist			1
he claims ' rfforts to prove the theory that carbon dioxide is a significant greenhouse gas and pollutant causing significant warming or weather effects have failed			2
there has been no warming over 18 years ' the statement contradicts the views of @entity20 , co-founder of the @entity2 , who last week said the belief humans are causing climate change is not backed up by science			1
in an open letter attacking the @entity22 , the 80 - year - old from @entity24 , said that what ' little evidence ' there is for global warming points to natural cycles in temperature			1
' there is no climate crisis , ' he wrote			2
' the ocean is not rising significantly			0
the polar ice is increasing , not melting away			0
polar bears are increasing in number			0
' heat waves have actually diminished , not increased			0
there is not an uptick in the number or strength of storms			0
the statement contradicts the views of @entity20 , co-founder of the @entity2 , who last week said the belief humans are causing climate change is not backed up by science dr @entity98 tweeted this provocative statement after a @entity101 study found methane leaking beneath the @entity37 the planet is ' f * * cked ' after scientists found huge plumes of deadly methane escaping from the seafloor			1
this is according to dr @entity98 who claims that methane will be the main driver of climate change if it escapes into the atmosphere			1
he said : ' if even a small fraction of @entity37 sea floor carbon is released to the atmosphere , we 're f 'd ' the scientist , based at the @entity119 and @entity120 , tweeted the provocative statement after a @entity101 study found methane leaking beneath the @entity37			2
some of this methane – which is over 20 times more potent than @entity124 at trapping heat - is now making it to the ocean 's surface			2
the leaking gas from the seafloor may have its origins in collapsing clusters of methane trapped in frozen water due to high pressure and low temperature			0
scientists at @entity138 called the discovery ' somewhat of a surprise , ' which , according to dr box , is an understatement			0
' we 're on a trajectory to an unmanageable heating scenario , and we need to get off it , ' dr @entity98 told @entity146 at @entity147 ' we 're f * * ked at a certain point , right ? it just becomes unmanageable			0
the climate dragon is being poked , and eventually the dragon becomes pissed off enough to trash the place			0
' ' i have studied this topic seriously for years			0
it has become a political and environment agenda item , but the science is not valid			0
' though the @entity2 did not mention mr @entity20 , the statement was published just days after his views were widely reported			1
according to @entity160 , mr @entity20 based his research on the findings of the @entity163 , a non-governmental international body of scientists			2
their role is to offer an second opinion of the evidence reviewed by the @entity22 's @entity170 ( @entity170 )			2
the @entity170 has warned that no one will be untouched by climate change with storm surges , flooding and heatwaves among the key risks			1
the report said that violent conflicts , food shortages and serious infrastructure damage were also predicted to become more widespread over the coming years ' there is no significant man - made global warming at this time , there has been none in the past and there is no reason to fear any in the future , ' added mr @entity20			1
' efforts to prove the theory that carbon dioxide is a significant greenhouse gas and pollutant causing significant warming or weather effects have failed			0
' the @entity170 has warned that no one will be untouched by climate change with storm surges , flooding and heatwaves among the key risks			1
the report said that violent conflicts , food shortages and serious infrastructure damage were also predicted to become more widespread over the coming years			0
it also claimed that the world is in ' an era of man - made climate change ' and has already seen impacts of global warming on every continent and across the oceans			1
it highlighted that in recent decades , @entity212 has seen changes in water resources as a result of melting glaciers and differences in rainfall , and reductions in wheat and maize yields			0
in the wake of the report 's publication there were renewed calls from scientists and campaigners for action to cut greenhouse gases and to help vulnerable people adapt to already - unavoidable impacts of climate change			1
in order to minimise the risk of human interference in the climate system , the international community has agreed limit temperature rise to 2 ° c above pre-industrial levels			2
projected temperature change from 2081 - 2100			0
for the first time , the report connects hotter global temperatures to hotter global tempers			0
top scientists are saying that climate change will complicate and worsen existing global security problems , such as civil wars , strife between nations and refugees ' we live in an era of man - made climate change , ' said @entity256 , co-chair of the @entity170 study on climate change impacts , vulnerabilities and adaptation , from the @entity261 , @entity262			1
at the time of the report , one of its contributors has accused the @entity170 of being too ' alarmist ' – and demanded his name be withdrawn			2
professor @entity269 , an economist at the @entity270 , said the drafts had been changed to make the findings more ' apocalyptic '			0
he said colleagues ' drifted too far to the alarmist side ' and were likening climate change to the ' @entity276 '			1
the rising risk of catastrophic events linked with rising temperatures is shown in this graphic by the @entity170			1

group claims temperatures have risen 0.6 ° c to 0.9 ° c in last 100 years
fuel emissions from humans activity are making planet warmer , it said
statement contradicts views of @entity20 , co-founder of channel
he says science does not back up belief humans cause climate change
comments made by @entity20 in an open letter attacking the @entity170
*earlier* this year , the @entity170 warned that no one will be untouched by climate change with storm surges , flooding and heatwaves among the key risks
