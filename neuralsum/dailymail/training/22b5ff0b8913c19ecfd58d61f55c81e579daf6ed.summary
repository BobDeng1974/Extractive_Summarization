a @entity1 judge has ordered @entity2 to remove search results of a man 's unflattering past in a new ' right to be forgotten ' order following a landmark ruling in @entity8			1
the @entity9 yesterday ordered @entity2 to remove search results that hinted at the man 's relations with a criminal organisation after he complained his privacy rights were violated			1
@entity2 spokesman @entity15 said the company has a standard process for removal requests , and people can come to @entity2			2
a @entity1 judge has ordered @entity2 to remove search results of a man 's unflattering past in a new ' right to be forgotten ' order following a landmark ruling in @entity8 in may it is unclear whether the case would prompt further requests for information to be removed in @entity1 he said : ' we remove pages from our search results when required by local law , including @entity1 's longstanding privacy and defamation laws			1
' @entity2 was reviewing the @entity9 court decision , mr @entity15 said			1
it is unclear whether the case would prompt further requests for information to be removed from websites in @entity1			0
in the court decision , judge @entity40 said some of the search results ' infringe personal rights , ' and had harmed the plaintiff			1
the case comes on the back of a decision by the @entity48 in may that ruled @entity2 should delete references to negative past information , including old debts and past arrests , to protect what has come to be called ' the right to be forgotten '			1
@entity2 chairman @entity56 ; the company is said to be reviewing the injunction while the @entity8 ruling has no baring on privacy cases in @entity1 it is a further blow against freedom of speech and a sign of increasing moves by the courts and legislators to allow people to censor their past			1
in @entity69 where @entity2 and other internet giants are based , the decision has no effect and experts say it is in conflict with the @entity69 constitution 's first amendment , which guarantees freedom of speech			1
examples of its use in the @entity79 have already included hundreds of pedophiles applying to have their criminal pasts erased online			0
within a month of the ruling coming into effect , over 12,000 people across @entity8 used an online @entity2 form to request information about them be deleted			1
more than 10 per cent of the requests came from pedophiles			0
at one point @entity2 said it was getting 20 requests per minute			2
the difference between @entity8 and the @entity69 means that results are deleted from local versions of google but not google.com			0
one man 's attempt to have his debts kept secret has led to the ' right to forget ' - which now seems to be spreading around the world			1
@entity101 battle began in 2009 when he found a @entity2 search of his name brought up an article in a @entity106 newspaper from 1998 about an auction for his foreclosed home , and a debt he had subsequently paid			2
he initially complained to the @entity111 , which rejected his request on the grounds the information was lawful and accurate			0
however , it asked @entity2 to remove it			2
the company then challenged the matter in the @entity106 courts before a ruling was made by the @entity48			1
the decision was widely criticised			0
@entity122 professor @entity121 said : ' privacy by default will encourage politicians , celebrities and other public figures to put their lawyers on track when they find inconvenient information online			0
' the impact of the ruling on @entity133 , was highlighted by the removal from @entity2 search listings of a blog @entity137 , the @entity138 's respected economics editor , wrote in 2007 about @entity139 , the former boss of investment bank @entity140 , and how he was forced out of his job after the investment bank suffered colossal losses on reckless investments it had made			1
in fact the removal was because one person no longer wanted a comment they had made on the blog associated with their name - emphasising that the ' right ' went far beyond ' forgetting ' the distant past			0
in may the @entity48 ruled that people have the right to have ' inadequate ' and ' irrelevant ' results about them wiped from the internet under the @entity157			2
under @entity159 17 , people who are mentioned in the data have the right to ‘ obtain from the controller the erasure of personal data relating to them and the abstention from further dissemination of such data '			0
@entity8 citizens can submit take - down requests directly to internet companies rather than to local authorities or publishers under the ruling			0
if a search engine elects not to remove the link , a person can seek redress from the courts			0
following the decision , thousands of pedophiles and others criminals sought to have their criminals pasts erased from the internet			0
all requests are considered by @entity2 , but it will have to balance privacy with the public interest , and the company has said it will not remove links in all cases			2
the risk which the ruling poses to a free press and free discussion of ideas has been repeatedly highlighted , particularly by news websites , among them @entity197			0
@entity197 publisher @entity198 said of the @entity48 decision : ' it is the equivalent of going into libraries and burning books you do n't like			2

the search results hinted at the man 's relations with a criminal organisation
the decision echos the ruling made by the @entity48 in may
@entity2 are said to be reviewing the injunction which was issued yesterday
