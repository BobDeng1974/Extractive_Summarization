@entity2 , 35 , pocketed more than £ 13,000 to which she was not entitled after failing to tell the authorities that she had a husband to provide for her			1
over a 15 - month period , from march 2010 to june 2011 , she was paid £ 10,050 in housing benefit , £ 1,680 in council tax benefit and £ 1,291 in income support - none of which she would have received if she had been honest about her circumstances			2
she would not have been allowed the benefits even if she had been a single parent , because for most of that period she had a part - time job as a £ 7.40 an hour office administrator with @entity22 , a property maintenance company			2
at @entity26 prosecuting counsel @entity24 said the job was something else she overlooked when filling in her claim forms			0
@entity2 , of @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 , had denied three charges of making false representations to obtain the benefits but was found guilty last month by @entity26 magistrates , who sent her to the crown court to be sentenced			1
mr @entity24 said the evidence against her was conclusive			0
in mitigation , defence barrister @entity39 said @entity2 was ' thoroughly ashamed of herself ' now that she understood the rules			1
' in her particular circumstances she did not consider that she and her husband were living together in the proper sense , ' he said			2
' now that the situation has been explained to her she accepts fully that she is guilty of the offences as charged			0
sentencing : the mother - of - four 's barrister told a judge at @entity26 ( pictured ) she was ashamed of her actions the court heard that @entity2 , whose youngest child is just 16 weeks old , is currently on maternity leave from what mr @entity39 described as ' a decent job '			1
judge @entity56 told her : ' i do not find it an attractive argument that because your husband was working abroad , and no doubt earning good money , it entitled you effectively to a single person 's allowances			2
' he added : ' many , many people who do not have the advantages that you have got in life manage to muddle along without committing offences such as these			0
' he imposed a community order , which will see @entity2 supervised by probation officers for 12 months			1
the judge also put her under a curfew to keep her indoors at home from 10pm to 5am every night for the next four months			0
he said the curfew started late enough so as not to interfere with her children 's evening activities			0
but he told her : ' it will mean you wo n't be able to go out and enjoy yourself			0
