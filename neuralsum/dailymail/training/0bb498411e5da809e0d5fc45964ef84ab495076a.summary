by @entity0 published : 16:28 est , 31 may 2013 updated : 16:31 est , 31 may 2013 the houses are neat , the streets and pavements are kept clean and even the flowers in the gardens are a picture of regimented orderliness			0
and it appears residents on the upmarket estate close to a river intend to keep it that way			2
for around a dozen signs have been installed on lamp posts warning dog walkers they could be fined £ 1,000 if they stray on to the estate of executive homes			1
fake : the bogus signs appeared around the @entity21 estate overnight but all is not as it seems – for while the signs may bear the @entity27 mark , it appears they are anything but official			1
one resident of the @entity21 estate in the suburb of @entity33 said : ‘ they went up overnight a while back and we all thought they were city council signs because we are on the edge of @entity38 and there has been a lot of dog walkers who do n’t dispose of their dog muck			1
exclusive : the estate of executive homes is in the leafy suburb of @entity33 in @entity27 ' there have been a number of schemes aimed at trying to eradicate it			1
we thought we were in the same catchment			0
’ another said : ‘ if they deter people from walking their dogs this way to get to the park then i ’m all for it			0
the pavements are much cleaner these days			0
‘ obviously one public - spirited house owner had enough and put up the signs to dissuade dog owners from coming this way			2
’ the signs read : ‘ @entity27			1
no dogs in this area ( except assistance dogs )			0
’ there is also a bogus 10mph speed limit sign			0
yesterday @entity27 expressed surprise at the sudden appearance of the signs			1
they say there is no record of them being put up by their contractors , and they believe they are the work of a disgruntled resident who may have got hold of an official sign and made copies			2
a council spokesman said : ‘ if we determine they are there without proper authority we will ask for the signs to be removed			0

fake signs suddenly appeared around exclusive estate
@entity27 said no record of their contractors *erecting* them
