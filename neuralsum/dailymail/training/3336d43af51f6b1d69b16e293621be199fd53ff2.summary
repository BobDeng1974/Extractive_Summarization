by @entity0 published : 11:32 est , 6 november 2012 updated : 12:17 est , 6 november 2012 one of @entity2 ’s oldest private schools is set to ditch its £ 10,000 annual fees and become a free school - blaming @entity2 's stuttering economy			1
pupil numbers at @entity8 , in @entity9 , @entity10 , have plunged from 1,200 in 1997 to just 478 now as its head admitted today people just can not afford to send their children			1
@entity8 was founded in 1509 and given its royal charter nearly 60 years later by @entity16 , but is now bidding to become a free school , funded by taxpayers			1
open to all : @entity21 at @entity8 @entity20 ( right ) and chairman of governors @entity22 say they must ditch the £ 10,000 annual fees because it is unaffordable yesterday school leaders told staff , pupils and parents about their plans to apply for the change next year			1
the move has been criticised by union bosses as ‘ a cynical move to get taxpayers to fund private education ’ while concerns have been expressed on the impact on nearby schools which could lose pupils			2
backing : local mp @entity42 agrees the school should forget its fees and allow anyone to join parents currently pay £ 10,236 per year in fees , with around 25 per cent of current students receiving some kind of bursary			1
if it becomes a free school the government would pay £ 4,500 per pupil			2
headmaster @entity20 said : ' the local economy is such that it ’s becoming increasingly difficult , even for high earning parents , to afford fees for education and that got us thinking about how we can positively move forwards			1
' this will allow more pupils to come to the school and receive an excellent education			0
' despite our exam successes , it ’s down to economics			0
' mr @entity20 said if successful , the new status would take effect from september 2014 and the final entrance exam would take place in january 2013			1
a decision is expected next @entity72 but fees would still be expected for the 2013/14 year			0
' we plan to return to around 1,100 pupils , which we believe we will be able to do			0
' it ’s possible we will get some backlash			0
however , i do n’t think many parents will have chosen the school because of its exclusivity			0
' free schools were introduced by education secretary @entity84 as part of his controversial schools shake - up			0
they receive their payments directly from @entity51 , but are not controlled by the local education authority			1
founded in 1509 as @entity91 came to the throne - the school survived the reformation and in 1567 was granted a @entity95 by @entity16 after moving to a new site in the 19th century its premises hosted early @entity100 games			0
the school became know as @entity8 , offering free education , before becoming a fee - charging school in the 20th century			1
notable former pupils include footballer @entity104 , @entity106 's @entity105 , tv presenter @entity107 , designer @entity108 and film director @entity109			0
if @entity8 is granted permission it will still be able to set its own extended curriculum , term dates and length of school day			2
@entity116 , @entity9 with @entity118 secretary and national executive member , said : ' regardless of where they have come from , free schools are neither wanted nor needed			0
' they are only going to cause further havoc with the local authority admission planning for school places			0
' i believe this is a cynical move to get taxpayers to fund private education that parents previously paid for and that there are plenty of excellent community comprehensives to choose from			2
” he said the change could also impact on other schools in the area as @entity8 would be seeking to take on 600 extra pupils			2
but @entity9 mp @entity42 said : “ i think it ’s very sensible and it will have the effect of preserving the ethos and character of @entity8 , whilst making the school more viable for children of families from more modest backgrounds			1

@entity8 has seen its pupil numbers plunge
