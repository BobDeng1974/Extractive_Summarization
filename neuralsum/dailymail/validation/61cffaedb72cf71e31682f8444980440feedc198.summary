' the apartments on this season of @entity8 all have really positive natural light			0
' for small splashes of luxury , @entity5 said that tiling all the way up to the ceiling shows that the renovations have n't been ' skimped on '			2
' with @entity141 and @entity142 's bathroom ( above ) , some of the buyers said the geometric tiling was too much , and some said " what a good feature " , so they have already polarised buyers , ' said @entity5 the @entity8 contestants @entity148 and @entity149 ( above ) used a neutral colour palate for their bathroom design @entity148 and @entity149 made the most of the natural light and offered plenty of storage for potential buyers ' it 's an extra thing that you would expect in a high end apartment , and an element i would definitely recommend , ' he said			1

' any spare cash at all should be thrown into the kitchen and bathroom			0
' @entity5 said that figures show that 80 % of property decisions are made by women , and he said that a nice kitchen is one of the biggest drawing cards for that reason			1
' i would just highlight that it 's important not to overinvest in these areas , and property experts say that renovators should only spend up to 10 % of the property 's value in total on renovations			2
having a good outdoor entertaining area is also a bonus , as many buyers will entertain at home and look for outdoors to be an extension of the living area			0
it is also crucial to research the demographic of the area before planning renovations , in order to ascertain what renovations are being done to other properties in the area			1
' you need to give due diligence to your renovations			0
what are renovated properties selling for in the area ? are you making your property what the end users will want ? , ' he said			1
