by sir @entity0 there will be plenty of pats on the back for @entity5 after a convincing @entity7 campaign but now is actually the time to be very tough with each other			1
@entity11 ’s team have taken huge strides forward over the past six weeks , both in the ambition of their attacking game and in the quality and skill of their execution			1
they , and especially @entity18 , deserve huge credit for their continued progress towards next year ’s @entity21			0
but the brutal truth that they must all take on board is that @entity5 have finished second in the table for a third year running and it is not going to get any easier			1
work to do : @entity11 and @entity5 have taken huge strides in this @entity7 , but they still only managed a second placed finish champions : @entity28 capped @entity30 's final championship with a memorable victory at the weekend , with the trophy to play for , @entity5 were playing the poorest team of the tournament who were out on their feet			1
by half - time @entity37 were on the ropes but @entity5 lacked the killer instinct to finish them off			1
this is now the next vital step in the development of this very talented team			0
there comes a point when the focus must move away from selection to how we are playing the game — and the coaches and players need to look at how to play the last quarter of matches			2
you need your best 15 players on the field during the most crucial period , but @entity5 lost the @entity7 because of the way they handled the last five minutes against @entity58 and the final 15 against @entity37			1
they could easily have scored three tries in the final 10 minutes against @entity37			1
i still fear @entity5 are losing so much by changing key players in key moments and the substitution policy is the one area in which i really disagree with the coaching team			1
the fact remains @entity5 never have their best team on the pitch when the final whistle blows			1
hauled off : @entity71 was substituted after just 53 minutes chance : @entity5 could have scored three tries in the final 10 minutes - but their strongest line - up was not on the field i was stunned to see @entity71 brought off after 53 minutes			1
he was one of the outstanding players in the first half			2
he stays on his feet longer than @entity77 in contact and sucks in defenders before looking to offload			0
he was pumped up , playing out of his skin and he had earned the right to exploit those gaps against a tiring team			0
players learn crucial things during a game and confidence grows , especially when they are so dominant			0
the defensive and attacking habits of your opposite man become clear during the heat of battle			0
substitutes will add something individually but in terms of the collective you lose much of what you have been building			0
i would have just loved to see the starting 15 finish the match			0
if the only changes had been for injury , what would the score have been on saturday ? this game was all about winning the tournament , not about developing your squad			0
pumped up : @entity71 had an excellent first half total : @entity5 scored 52 points but it was n't enough be under no illusions , @entity113 this summer is a huge step up			1
the @entity7 is a fantastic tournament , but the standard of rugby will not have the @entity119 teams quaking just yet — and certainly not the @entity113			1
@entity113 still play the game a yard quicker — from the basic speed of passing in moving the ball away from contact to the speed of the back row getting over the ball at the breakdown			0
a lot of @entity5 ’s players will have never played in @entity113 before and if you get caught in the headlights it can get very ugly very quickly			1
this is where @entity5 ’s attitude is crucial and the likes of @entity135 , @entity136 and @entity137 are priceless			2
if you do not have a bit of that edge when you get off the plane down there it is guaranteed you will get smashed			0
@entity18 has a get - out - of - jail - free card with his first fixture because he is without players involved in the @entity147 final but in their final two tests @entity5 have an opportunity to make a real statement			1
@entity5 ’s fitness still concerns me and we are some way short from the overall fitness of @entity5 ’s players at the turn of the millennium			1
when was the last time @entity137 played 80 minutes ? individually , every player has to utterly commit to @entity5 with the ambition to ensure we arrive at the @entity21 as the fittest and most powerful team in history			1
that must be worked on by players every day behind the scenes			0
lying in wait : @entity5 face @entity166 and the mighty @entity113 this summer needed : @entity5 need @entity168 to come back to his best and pressure @entity169 that should also inspire players on the cusp of the squad or fighting to get back in			1
somewhere back in @entity176 , @entity168 will be seething , but @entity5 need him to get back to his best to pressure @entity169			2
first - choice players need to be under constant pressure to keep their place			2
this has been a fantastic tournament for @entity169 and @entity135			0
but you need pressure in all positions			0
@entity58 were one forward pass from handing the title to @entity5 and that trophy can transform the stature of a team			1
i was in a packed hotel bar in @entity192 on saturday and @entity193 fans were screaming for @entity58			2
i never thought i ’d see that and i must confess to not being one of those ! what would have happened if @entity5 had kicked off third on saturday with an exact target to go for ? would the substitutions or the tactics have been different ? would they have played with more urgency in the last quarter ? would the mindset have changed ? if the answer is yes , then that explains the next stage of the team ’s development			2
a winning mentality is about being ruthless in achieving your targets			0
congratulations to @entity28 , i did not think they quite had the firepower to go to @entity216 and beat a desperate @entity58 , but what a wonderfully deserving send - off for @entity218			1
in his final 12 months as a professional player he has won a @entity222 series and a @entity7 trophy			2
wales have been a shadow of the team they were before the @entity222 tour but they will bounce back			0
they still have very good players and coaches and everyone in @entity224 needs to regroup behind @entity233 and @entity234			2
regroup : wales are a shadow of their former selves and need to regroup behind @entity234 and @entity233 @entity238 — i did n’t even realise there was a trophy			0
tired legs — if a team or individual has tired legs , or needs ‘ fresh legs ’ , they should not have started			0
@entity248 — everyone carries a ball			0
a phrase created for unimaginative players who just smash into people .			0

@entity11 's men were good but @entity5 lacked the killer instinct to get the job done
they lost the @entity7 because of the way they handled the last five minutes in @entity58 and the last 15 in @entity37
i fear @entity5 are changing too many key players at key moments - their best players need to be on the field when the whistle blows
