if you 're dining in upmarket restaurants of the kind owned by superstar chefs like @entity13 , you expect to pay for the privilege			2
but one well - heeled shopper with a thing for fast food decided he would rather spend $ 10,000 - about £ 6,000 - of his hard - earned cash on an old tub of @entity7 's sauce			1
the condiment - a creation named @entity6 sauce after basketball star @entity23 - languished on auction site @entity8 for months			1
then seller @entity3 added a ' buy it now ' price and shopper 's mouths started to water			1
@entity29 told @entity31 's @entity30 : ' i had this barbecue sauce on the shelf for 20 years			1
' it ’s probably edible			1
' it might not taste as fresh as when it was made though			2
@entity29 , who owned five @entity7 ’s restaurants in @entity39 and two in @entity41 , saved the sauce after selling his restaurants in 1996			1
' it was in my basement and i would look at it occasionally , ' he said			2
' i thought it would be worth something some day			2
' it was only sold in @entity51 and @entity52			2
@entity23 famously played for the @entity51			0
@entity29 ’s ad on @entity8 for the sauce read : ' a once in a lifetime chance to own the rarest of rare @entity23 and @entity7 's collectible ! ' he thinks it is the only tub of it 's kind still about			1
' i do n’t imagine anybody else has one , ' he said			0
the @entity61 was a quarter - pound hamburger with smoked bacon , cheese , @entity61 barbecue sauce , onions , mustard and pickles			2
@entity3 claimed the sauce also is special because @entity23 was the first person to have a @entity7 ’s sandwich named after him			1
hungry to win : the sauce was for the first burger named after anyone - the @entity6			1
it contained a quarter - pounder , smoked bacon , cheese , @entity61 barbecue sauce , onions , mustard and pickles			2
he tried to sell the sauce by auction for four months before he switched to a fixed ' buy it now ' price			1
' all of a sudden everybody was looking at it , ' he said			0
the buyer is from @entity51			0
@entity29 thought he was probably a @entity51 and @entity23 fan			1
the @entity30 said @entity29 still has ' at least three storage units ' full of @entity7 ’s memorabilia he has been trying to shift on @entity8 for three years			1
his daughter , @entity90 of @entity91 , writes the words and takes the pictures			0
he sells and ships them			0
items have gone to @entity97 , @entity98 , @entity99 and around @entity100			0
the @entity6 sauce was his most expensive item			1
' i 'm pretty ecstatic , ' he said			0

' @entity108 toys are popular			0
after selling his stores he had a lot left			2
' a lot of them are unopened , ' he said			0

' at the moment he is ebaying a @entity7 ’s edition ' @entity122 ' @entity121 tape , a @entity124 flag and a @entity7 alarm clock			0
' if i did n't start selling them i 'd be sticking the kids with them , ' he said			0
