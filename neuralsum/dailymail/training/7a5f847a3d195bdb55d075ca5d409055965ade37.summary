by @entity0 published : 04:12 est , 29 november 2013 updated : 04:25 est , 29 november 2013 sometimes it 's hard to believe the best things in life are free			1
but the truth is exactly that , according to a poll which says crisp winter weather , a clean house and duvet days are the things which make us smile			1
the survey asked 2,000 people in @entity13 about their favourite pleasures			1
what a view ! with scenes like this in the @entity19 , it 's no surprise our top pleasures include walks in the countryside			1
others included cuddles , saying ' i love you ' , duvet days and sitting down in a clean house at number one was having a cuddle with a partner - followed closely by clean sheets at number two			1
country walks and saying ' i love you ' also made it into the top ten , though not everything was free			1
the top ten also included chocolate , booking a holiday , @entity43 dinner and alcohol			1
however , @entity45 , managing director of @entity46 which ran the poll , said the full list showed how simple pleasures are still the best			1
' our everyday lives are becoming so much more stressful and busier than ever before , ' he added			2
' because of this , many of us appreciate things like reading a book or going for a stroll a lot more than we used to			1
the good life : a cuddle with a partner came in at number one , followed by lazy days at home ( posed by models ) temptation : despite having simple tastes we still ca n't resist a good cheese board , which hit number 17 ' some 80 per cent of those polled enjoy exploring the countryside , many preferring to do it on foot			1
something as simple as a relaxing countryside walk can turn a bad day into a good one			2
' the poll was commissioned by @entity46 to launch its new range of custom - made maps , where ramblers can choose the area they want printed themselves			1
the maps start at Â£ 16.99			2
pleasures which ca n't be bought included kissing , snuggling under a blanket , hugging your baby and ' good photos '			1
receiving post and flowers also featured , as did a day at the beach			2
among the more costly items were edible treats - including cheese boards , chocolate , steak , pub roasts , picnics and cake			1
and , of course , a list of pleasures would be nothing without payday - which clocked in at number 26			1
