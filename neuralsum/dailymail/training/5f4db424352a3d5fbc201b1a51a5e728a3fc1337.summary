by @entity0 published : 04:33 est , 6 september 2013 updated : 12:50 est , 6 september 2013 a lunatic driver who uploaded a video of himself breaking a highly illegal record by driving 26.5 miles around @entity5 in just 24minutes and seven seconds before bragging how he could n't be traced , has been arrested			1
officers swooped on the @entity9 home of @entity10 in @entity11 yesterday and impounded a 2006 @entity12 he allegedly used to tear through the streets at breakneck speed in august this year			0
@entity10 , who was charged with reckless driving and reckless endangerment , is believed to have uploaded hair - raising footage taken on a dashboard camera onto @entity21 video , under the pseudonym , ' @entity23 '			2
after news of the stunt made headlines earlier this week , @entity44 commissioner @entity43 declared war on @entity49 , and made it a priority to track him down			1
the high - speed journey in a manual 2006 @entity12 , begins at @entity53 at @entity54 , just outside of @entity11 , with @entity10 weaving through traffic , undertaking moving cars at breakneck speed			0
he then hurtles across the @entity58 , @entity5 , and @entity59 , before tearing through the @entity60 and around the downtown tip of the island to beat an earlier 2010 record of 26 minutes , three seconds			1
held up : the driver says he stopped at six red lights in his manual 2006 @entity12 @entity66 the illict racer dismissed claims he is a reckless driver , saying he was in control the whole time			1
while some car enthusiasts on motoring blogs have praised the unknown driver , others say he sets a bad example for young drivers			2
however the driver has dismissed claims he was reckless while averaging speeds of 66 miles an hour			1
' whether you 're a good driver or not , when you 're on the road , you have a high chance of getting hit by a drunk driver , being cut off , especially in @entity9 , ' he told @entity84			2
' being a good driver , you 're more aware of what is around you			2
' being a fast driver does n't mean that you 're inherently a bad or reckless driver			1
' like i said before , i 'm in control			0
that said , understand traffic patterns , understand what 's around you and understand how others control or do n't control their cars			0
' record - breaker : the driver raced around the eastern edge of @entity5 and looped around the island Â¿ s southern tip dare - devil : the motorist weaved through traffic in the city 's tunnel but miraculously avoided a collision footage of the journey , compressed into a six - minute clip , shows the driver zip through west street / @entity113 , which finally opens up in @entity114 by all of @entity117 's buildings			1
heading north , he turns right by the @entity119 in @entity120 and gets across @entity5 at one of its narrowest points			2
he turns back onto @entity53 and races to the finish line , where he started the trip			0
sight - seeing : the driver was probably driving too fast to take in views of the @entity130 on the west side or the @entity132 on the east side new record ? the driver claims to have completed his journey in 24 minutes and seven seconds - the fastest time ever he said he prepared for the run by working out the traffic flows			1
' other than my car being stocked , i went out various times throughout the night to figure out the traffic patterns , ' he told @entity84			0
' i was always in control			0
in fact , this was n't the first time i broke the record			0
i can do it consistently under 24 minutes and most likely beat my own record again			1
' he also invited anyone to try and beat his record			0
just watch out for the speeding tickets , ' he said			0
illegal speed racer @entity154 circled @entity5 in 27 minutes in 2001 , reaching speeds of 144 miles an hour over the 24.48 mile distance			1
he never released the tape			0
in 2010 , another driver smashed that record with a time of 26 minutes , three seconds , released by @entity162			1
the driver completed the hair - raising lap in a 2006 @entity12 similar to this ( file picture )			0

police arrest man they believe to be lunatic driver ' @entity49 '
he had filmed himself lapping @entity5 in 24 minutes , seven seconds
but bragged *online* how he was n't ' reckless ' and could n't be identified
