the scientists believe the same process may be used by all mushroom fungi , including those that cause diseases in plants , animals and humans by @entity9 reporter published : 11:00 est , 25 november 2013 updated : 05:46 est , 26 november 2013 mushrooms have an extraordinary ability to control the weather , scientists have learned			1
by altering the moisture of the air around them , they are able to whip up winds that blow away their spores and help them disperse			1
plants use a variety of methods to spread seeds , including gravity , forceful ejection , wind , water and animals			1
scientists used high - speed filming techniques and mathematical modelling to show how oyster and shitake mushrooms ( pictured ) release water vapour to cools the air around them , creating convection currents mushrooms have long been thought of as passive seed spreaders , releasing their spores and then relying on air currents to carry them			1
but new research has shown that mushrooms are able to disperse their spores over a wide area even when there is not a breath of wind - by creating their own ' weather '			1
@entity48 scientists used high - speed filming techniques and mathematical modelling to show how oyster and @entity51 mushrooms release water vapour to cool the air surrounding them , creating convection currents			1
the scientists believe the same process may be used by all mushroom fungi , including those that cause diseases in plants , animals and humans ( puffball fungus , pictured ) this in turn generates miniature winds that lift their spores into the air			1
the findings , presented at the annual meeting of the @entity70 's @entity69 in @entity71 , suggest that mushrooms are far more than mechanical spore manufacturers			2
' our research shows that these " machines " are much more complex than that : they control their local environments , and create winds where there were none in nature , ' said lead scientist professor @entity83 , from @entity84 in @entity85 , @entity86			2
' that 's pretty amazing , but fungi are ingenious engineers			0
' the scientists believe the same process may be used by all mushroom fungi , including those that cause diseases in plants , animals and humans			1
a mushroom - or toadstool - is technically the fleshy , spore - bearing , fruiting body of a fungus			0
millions of spores , microscopic single - celled ' seeds ' , may be produced by a single mushroom , and at least a few of these are likely to land somewhere suitable for fungal growth			1
more than 80 different types of wild edible mushroom grow in the @entity109 , as well as many poisonous species			0
one of the world 's deadliest mushrooms , the death cap , is a common sight in @entity109 woodland			0
although pleasant tasting , just one ounce of the fungus is enough to kill			0
a fungus is neither a plant nor an animal			0
it is similar to a plant , but it has no chlorophyll so can not make its own food like a plant can through photosynthesis ( the process by which a plant produces energy from exposure to sunlight ) fungi are thought to have diverged from the plant and animal kingdoms about one billion years ago			2
they obtain their food by absorbing nutrients from their surroundings			0
some fungi cause disease by using living organisms for food			0
these fungi infect plants , animals and even other fungi			1
athlete â€™s foot and ringworm are two fungal diseases in humans			2
fungi exist in various habitats , including the depths of the oceans , lakes , deserts , very salty environments and areas of extremely high or low temperatures			2
some can survive even after being exposed to intense uv and cosmic radiation as one would encounter during space travel			0
indeed during the 13 years the @entity167 was in orbit , a great deal of equipment was continuously being damaged by mutated fungi that had been breeding in the space station .			0

researchers found that oyster and @entity51 mushrooms release water vapour that cools the air around them , creating convection currents
this in turn generates miniature winds that lift their spores into the air
the scientists believe the same process may be used by all mushroom fungi , including those that cause diseases in plants , animals and humans
