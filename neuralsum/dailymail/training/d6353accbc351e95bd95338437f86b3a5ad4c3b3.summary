the average house price in @entity1 will reach almost £ 1million within two decades unless urgent action is taking to tackle the country ’s property market , an alarming report warns today			1
if prices continue to rise on current trends , by 2034 the average home will cost £ 900,000 , according to charity shelter			1
it means more than half of all 20 to 34 - year - olds could be living with their parents by 2040 after being ‘ priced out ’ of the market			1
reserach by @entity9 and @entity16 shows how average house prices in @entity1 will hit £ 902,763 by 2034 on current trends the research , compiled by @entity9 and @entity16 , found that property prices could quadruple from the current level of around £ 220,000 if more is not done to tackle the housing shortage			1
if property prices continue to rise as they have over the last 17 years , the cost of an average home in @entity1 will be £ 446,000 in 2024 , ballooning to £ 903,000 ten years later , the research predicts			1
at present , the average home in @entity1 costs around £ 225,000			0
the report also warned that rocketing prices would prevent children flying the nest , as by 2040 half of those aged 20 - 34 will still be living with their parents			1
@entity31 , @entity32 head of corporate affairs at @entity16 , said @entity1 ’s housing market is ‘ a big and messy problem ’			2
she said : ‘ for many people , particularly those in their twenties , the aspiration of owning their own ‘ castle ’ is fast becoming a fairy tale			0
’ falling rates of house building since 1946 has seen a sharp rise in house prices home ownership among the under - 35s has fallen markedly in the last two decades the number of 20 - 34 - year - olds has risen dramatically as more young people are priced out of buying a home companies ’ ability to ‘ attract and retain talent ’ is also affected , according to @entity16 , as young people are put off living and working in @entity55 by the astronomical cost of buying a property			1
a senior official at the @entity59 last night also voiced concerns about rising property prices			0
chief economist @entity62 said : ‘ we know we should be nervous about what ’s going on in the housing market			0
’ the shelter report , titled building the homes we need , maps out a programme for the next parliament that it says would help the next government turn the tide on the housing shortage by raising house building levels to 250,000 a year by 2021 , which would meet the growth in demand			2
among the suggestions to fix what shelter describes as a ‘ broken ’ market is the creation of a new ‘ national housing investment bank ’ , which would provide low cost , long term loans for housing providers , as part of a programme of new ways to finance affordable house building			0
it said the bank could also offer special savings accounts , such as ‘ housing isas ’ to raise finance from retail deposits			0
the rate of private sector housebuilding has tumbled since the 2007 financial crash the report also warns that homes in the @entity32 are much smaller than those seen in countries around the world experts have pointed to an imbalance between the supply of homes for sale and demand from would - be buyers as putting an upward pressure on house prices as the housing market recovery gathers pace			1
despite @entity115 support schemes , the housing market is ‘ increasingly skewed ’ towards people who are reliant on getting cash help from their parents , the report said , with only around one third of first - time buyers in 2011 managing to get on the property ladder without needing any extra financial help			2
the research estimates that more than half of all 20 to 34 - year - olds could be living with their parents by 2040 due to being ‘ priced out ’ of the housing market unless there is radical change			1
the report said : ‘ if nothing is done to increase the supply of homes , house prices will almost certainly continue to rise faster than wages , pricing yet more people out of home ownership			1
’ the report also suggests empowering local authorities to create ‘ new home zones ’ , which could generate over 8,000 extra homes a year			2
@entity9 and @entity16 warn that high land prices are the root of high - and rising - house prices this idea would involve a local authority selling a plot of land off for a cheaper price to a developer who in return will build affordable homes , rather than the land going to a developer who might pay more for the land but wants to use it to build homes at the top end of the market			1
the report also suggested that developments could be speeded up by charging council tax on homes that should have been built after a reasonable period for their construction has passed			2
more garden cities should also be built in ‘ high demand ’ areas , the report said			0
it said the next government should consult on and propose sites for up to five new garden cities comprising around 30,000 homes			0
the report said more should be done to help smaller builders get back into the market by using government guarantees to improve access to their finance			0
@entity182 , @entity9 's chief executive , said : ‘ our chronic shortage of affordable homes means that a generation face a future of living in their childhood bedrooms into their thirties			2
but this report proves that the next government can turn the tide on the housing shortage within a single parliament			0
‘ the thousands of young people and families forced to watch their dream of stable home slip further out of reach are already paying the price for successive governments ' failure to build the homes we need			0
with housing now a top issue for voters , politicians of all parties are rightly beginning to feel the need to act			0

if house prices continue to rise on current trend will hit £ 900,000 by 2034
more than half of 20 - 34 - year - olds will be living with their parents by 2040
report by @entity9 and @entity16 warns *100,000* more homes needed each year
