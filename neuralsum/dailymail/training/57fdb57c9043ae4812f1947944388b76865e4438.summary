by @entity0 last updated at 4:40 pm on 6th october 2011 @entity1 announced she will not run for president in 2012 in a statement to her supporters late on wednesday afternoon			1
after months of speculation months and side - stepping questions			1
she finally announced that she will not run for the @entity7 in a statement because her ' family comes first '			1
in a letter sent to her supporters , she wrote : ' after much prayer and serious consideration , i have decided that i will not be seeking the 2012 @entity15 nomination for president of the @entity17			1
' hours later she appeared on @entity18 and further explained her decision to be an effective outsider			1
by for now ! @entity1 announced she will not run for president , but she wo n't be far from the media eye as she promised to work an outsider to help causes and candidates she supports ' after prayerful consideration and a lot of discussion with the family , i concluded that i believe i can be an effective voice in a real decisive role in helping get true public servants elected to office , ' she told @entity34			1
@entity1 said she announced her ' no ' in a statement because , unlike @entity36 , she did n't want to have a big press conference about it as it 's ' not about me ' ' you do n't need a title to make a difference in this country			1
i think that i 'm proof of that			1
' @entity1 also insisted it was n't an easy or absolute decision			1
' i would go back and forth about whether now is the time , and if i say no to the opportunity that 's in front of me via running for office now , will -- political speaking , will i die ? will i be ineffective ? ' she also managed to make a dig about @entity55 governor @entity36			1
' i wanted to , you know , just kind of put the marker down and say , no , i 'm not running , not have a big press conference about it , not make a big darn deal about it because this is n't about me			1
and it 's not about @entity36			1
' it has been suggested that she now will lend her weight to @entity68 governor and @entity15 presidential hopeful @entity69			2
the announcement comes after she was stung by suggestions in a new book that she once snorted cocaine off a 55 gallon oil drum while snowmobiling with friends and had illicit affairs with a top @entity78 star and one of her husband 's business partners			2
the revelations , which will inevitably now be seen to have struck a devastating blow to her political ambitions , suggest mrs @entity1 took the class a drug with her husband , while smoking marijuana at college in secret liaisons with one of her professors			2
race : it is likely @entity1 will now support @entity69 in the battle to unseat president @entity97 @entity99 's book @entity98 : searching for the @entity100 also alleged that the former governor of @entity102 is far from the traditional family woman she claims to be			2
mrs @entity1 , 47 , had a one - night stand with @entity107 basketball star @entity106 less than a year before she eloped with her husband , the book claimed			2
she was said to have met the 6ft 8ins player in 1987 when he was playing in a college basketball tournament in @entity102 and she worked as a sports reporter for @entity112 television			2
it was also claimed that she had a six - month affair with @entity115 , who ran a snowmobile dealership with her husband @entity117 - a betrayal which led to @entity117 dissolving their business			2
heat : the book alleges that @entity1 had a one night stand with basketball star @entity106 explosive : the book , written by @entity127 , right , may well be seen to have halted @entity1 's 2012 bid in a bid to expose mrs @entity1 's skeletons , mr @entity127 studied the former vice presidential candidate for three years and last year even moved in to a home next door in @entity134 , @entity102 , to dig some more			2
recent polls had , however , suggested the outspoken politician was gaining ground on president @entity97			0
after trailing mr @entity97 by more than 20 percentage points in polls all year , the @entity141 - @entity140 survey , taken on september 13 and 14 , had the president leading mrs @entity1 by only 49 points to 44			0
a key reason is that she started to lead mr @entity97 among independents - a sharp turnaround			0
the poll found that @entity97 looks increasingly vulnerable in next year 's election , with a majority of voters believing he will lose to any @entity15 , a solid number saying they will definitely vote against him and most potential @entity15 challengers gaining on him			0
separation ? : @entity117 , seen here with his wife outside their house in @entity134 , @entity102 , is said to be filing for a divorce governor @entity69 of @entity68 continues to lead the field of announced candidates for the @entity15 presidential nomination , supported by 30 per cent of @entity15 and @entity15 - leaning independents			0
he is followed by former governor @entity165 of @entity166 with 22 per cent and representative @entity167 of @entity168 with 12 per cent			0
others trail in single digits			0
a separate survey for @entity18 - where @entity1 is a highly - paid commentator - found that an astonishing 66 per cent of @entity174 supporters - and 71 per cent of @entity15 - would prefer , however , if she did not run for president			1
october 5 , 2011 @entity134 , @entity102 after much prayer and serious consideration , i have decided that i will not be seeking the 2012 @entity15 nomination for @entity180			0
as always , my family comes first and obviously @entity117 and i put great consideration into family life before making this decision			1
when we serve , we devote ourselves to @entity186 , family and country			0
my decision maintains this order			1
my decision is based upon a review of what common sense conservatives and @entity193 have accomplished , especially over the last year			1
i believe that at this time i can be more effective in a decisive role to help elect other true public servants to office – from the nation ’s governors to congressional seats and the @entity202			0
we need to continue to actively and aggressively help those who will stop the “ fundamental transformation ” of our nation and instead seek the restoration of our greatness , our goodness and our constitutional republic based on the rule of law			0
from the bottom of my heart i thank those who have supported me and defended my record throughout the years , and encouraged me to run for president			0
know that by working together we can bring this country back – and as i ’ve always said , one does n’t need a title to help do it			1
i will continue driving the discussion for freedom and free markets , including in the race for president where our candidates must embrace immediate action toward energy independence through domestic resource developments of conventional energy sources , along with renewables			0
we must reduce tax burdens and onerous regulations that kill @entity17 industry , and our candidates must always push to minimize government to strengthen the economy and allow the private sector to create jobs			0
those will be our priorities so @entity17 can be confident that a smaller , smarter government that is truly of the people , by the people , and for the people can better serve this most exceptional nation			0
in the coming weeks i will help coordinate strategies to assist in replacing the president , re-taking the @entity245 , and maintaining the @entity7			0
thank you again for all your support			0
let ’s unite to restore this country ! @entity186 bless @entity17			0
