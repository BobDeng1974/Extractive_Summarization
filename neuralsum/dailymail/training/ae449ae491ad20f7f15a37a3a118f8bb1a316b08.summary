by @entity0 published : 09:09 est , 4 october 2013 updated : 11:51 est , 4 october 2013 two brothers with a rare degenerative disease that causes their urine and bones to turn black have been given hope after their father gave up his job to look for a cure			1
@entity9 and @entity10 , aged 10 and 12 , have black bone disease – also known as @entity12 ( @entity13 ) – which will cause them to develop severe early - onset osteoarthritis unless a cure can be found			1
the genetic disease causes the bones , cartilage , urine and earwax to turn black			1
it also results in brittle bones and heart disease			1
@entity10 ( left ) and @entity9 ( right ) @entity25 both have a genetic condition called @entity27 which causes their bones and urine to turn black			1
it also causes early - onset osteoarthritis and , possibly , heart disease currently there is no treatment for the disease and @entity9 and @entity10 could start to develop symptoms at any age from their mid-teens to their 40s			1
however , their father , @entity25 , 40 , has given up his job as ceo of a charity called @entity46 - which aims to offer solar solutions to poverty - to help organise a clinical trial for a drug which he believes will offer a life - saving treatment for his children and all other @entity13 sufferers			1
mr @entity25 , from @entity53 , told @entity54 : ‘ my hope is that my children never have to feel the pain of the symptoms – that they just wo n’t have to worry about it			2
’ just after @entity10 was born , mr @entity25 and his wife , @entity60 , noticed that his nappies were turning black			1
they called an emergency doctor who thought the problem was caused by his mother eating red cabbage and then breastfeeding him			0
however , his parents were not convinced so took him to a gp who sent a range of tests to @entity73			0
the boys ' father , @entity74 ( pictured with @entity9 ) , gave up his job in 2010 to help find a cure for the condition			1
he believes a treatment has now been identified and is helping to organise a clinical trial currently @entity10 ( right ) and @entity9 ( left ) are healthy but they will start to develop symptoms in early adulthood unless a treatment is found when the tests were analysed , they revealed that @entity10 has @entity87 which is a genetic disorder caused by a recessive gene			1
mr @entity25 said : ‘ it took a lot of time to sink in			2
doctors told us there was nothing we could do – that was very disempowering			0
‘ it took us a while to start realising that we could do something			0
’ @entity87 causes bone and cartilage to become discoloured			2
image shows the elbow joint of an anonymous sufferer when the couple had their second child , @entity9 , they knew there was a 25 per cent chance that he would also have the condition			2
mr @entity25 explained that after he was born , they kept checking his nappies for fear they too would go black			0
he said : ‘ we were checking @entity9 ’s nappies again and again			0
it was so sad when it happened but we try to be positive			0
‘ we are given a chance to find a cure because the disease does n’t affect them as children			0
’ the boys are currently healthy but without treatment will eventually start to develop symptoms such as joint problems and back pain – the early symptoms of osteoarthritis			1
the osteoarthritis is caused by a toxic acid called homogentisic acid ( @entity134 ) attacking their bones and cartilage , turning them black and brittle			1
in people with @entity87 , the acid accumulates at 2,000 times the normal rate			2
this also causes discolouration of the ears and black spots in the eyes			0
there is also a growing link between aku and heart disease			1
this is because toxic acid called homogentisic acid @entity134 causes the blood vessels and valves in the heart to harden , turning them black , brittle and less effective at managing the flow of blood around the body			1
although this is still believed to be an uncommon symptom of @entity13 , it is a potentially fatal consequence of the disease			0
@entity10 was diagnosed as a baby when his parents noticed his nappies were black - until then they did not realise they carried the gene mutation			2
there was a 25 per cent chance @entity9 would also be affected @entity13 can also cause several other symptoms , such as kidney , prostate and bladder stones , black or dark sweat or a blue speckled discolouration of the skin			1
however , there is hope that all sufferers of @entity87 will soon be able to live a normal life without developing any symptoms			2
in 2010 mr @entity25 gave up his job to join the @entity180 and help their search for a cure			2
he believes that a drug called @entity184 could prevent @entity134 building up in patients and , therefore , prevent symptoms developing			2
mr @entity25 ( pictured with @entity10 ) believes the drug @entity184 could prevent acid building up in patients and , therefore , prevent symptoms developing			1
the drug is already used to treat another rare disease the drug is already used to treat another rare disease and some @entity87 patients have been able to access it in @entity195			1
however , it is not currently licenced for use in people with @entity87 meaning they fear it could become unavailable at any time – many patients can also currently not access it at all			2
therefore , the @entity180 is organising a clinical trial involving 140 patients from across @entity205 in the hope of getting the drug licenced			1
the trial will take four years and will operate out of centres in @entity209 , @entity210 and @entity211			0
mr @entity25 ( pictured with @entity9 ) said : ' personally , this means hope for my kids and for all of the patients			1
we hear the most horrible stories of people having to stop work and becoming depressed because of the symptoms			0
for me , it is important my kids do n't suffer this pain ' the medical side of the trial , which is expected to start at the end of the year , is being funded by the @entity227 but the organisers need to raise $ 98,000 to pay for patient transport , carers for the more disabled patients and to provide support for patients			0
to date they have raised just over $ 40,000 and they only have 14 days left to raise the rest of the money			0
if the trial is successful , the treatment could be made available on the @entity240 within the next five years			1
if the drug trial is successful , the treatment could become available on the @entity240 within five years			1

’ to donate , visit www.indiegogo.com/projects/cure-black-bone-disease @entity87 , also known as @entity12 ( @entity13 ) , is a rare genetic disease which causes early - onset osteoarthritis			1
it is causes by the lack of an enzyme called homogentisic dioxygenase which means that patients can not fully breakdown a toxic acid called homogentisic acid			1
as a result , the acid builds up in the body at 2,000 times the normal rate			0
the first symptom is usually black urine			0
other symptoms do not usually develop until the patient is in their 20s			0
at this stage , the patients tend to develop joint problems and back pain which is the start of osteoarthritis			2
this eventually causes the bones to become brittle and can be very disabling			0
the condition can also cause the eyeballs , sweat and earwax to turn black			0
it is thought there is also a link between aku and potentially fatal heart disease			1
this is because @entity134 causes the blood vessels and valves in the heart to harden , turning them black , brittle and less effective at managing the flow of blood around the body			2
@entity13 is caused by a genetic mutation - it is a recessive disorder meaning the @entity13 gene must be carried by both of the patient 's parents			0
if both parents are carriers , there is a 25 per cent chance of their child developing the condition			0
the condition is thought to occur in about one in every 250,000 to 500,000 people			0

@entity9 and @entity10 , 10 and 12 , have @entity87
currently they are healthy but they will start to develop *debilitating* symptoms in early adulthood unless an effective treatment is found
the disease causes severe , early - onset osteoarthritis as well as bone , urine , earwax and eyeball discolouration - can also cause heart disease
the symptoms are caused by the rapid build up of toxic acid in the body
@entity25 , the boys ' father , has given up his job as ceo of a charity to help organise a clinical trial for a drug he believes will treat the disease
if the trial is successful , the drug could be licenced and available on the @entity240 within five years
