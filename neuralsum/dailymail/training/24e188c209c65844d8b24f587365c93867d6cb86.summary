a fish caught close the the @entity4 nuclear plant is over 2,500 times the legal safe radiation limit for seafood , the plant 's operator has revealed			1
the company @entity7 ( @entity7 ) caught the fish , dubbed ' @entity10 ' online , in the bay close to the @entity13 main reactor			1
it was confirmed by @entity7 to have amounts of radioactive cesium equal to 254,000 becquerels per kilogram , or 2540 times the limit of 100 becquerels / kg set for seafood by the government			2
the @entity21 caught by @entity7 which had over 2,500 times the legal limit of radiation for seafood due to @entity4 fallout a @entity27 ( @entity27 ) is a unit of radioactive decay equal to one disintegration per second			1
the @entity27 is the basic unit of radioactivity used in the international system of radiation units , referred to as the “ @entity36 ” units			0
37 billion ( 3.7 × 1010 ) becquerels = 1 curie ( @entity38 )			0
the maximum level of radiation allowed in foods for human consumption is 100 becquerels / kilogram			0
scientists in the region are increasingly worried that other fish in the area are feeding off these and other contaminated species			2
however , the murasoi specimen caught near @entity4 did not seem to show any major abnormalities in terms of its physical appearance			0
@entity7 is installing a new series of nets beneath the surface of the water around the 20 kilometer perimeter in hopes of restricting the migration of the contaminated fish outside of the region			1
a report in october last year found radiation levels in most kinds of fish caught off the coast of @entity4 have n't declined in the year following @entity69 's nuclear disaster in march 2011			1
an earthquake knocked out nuclear plant 's cooling system , causing three reactor cores to melt and spew radiation into the ocean			2
researchers believe that deposits of the chemical cesium on the seafloor or leakage from the damaged reactors is continuing to contaminate the waters - and has the potential to threaten fisheries for decades			0
the levels in the fish are also 10 times higher than the radiation measured last august in scorpion fish caught near @entity4			0
the crippled @entity90 nuclear power plant is seen in @entity91 , @entity4 prefecture , northern @entity69			0
experts have found a fish in a nearby port over 2,500 time the legal limit for radioactivity in seafood on 21 august last year , @entity7 announced that rockfish caught in the @entity99 within the circular area of ​ ​ 20 km around the plant , which is closed to all human activity , had a level of 25,800 becquerels of cesium per kilogram			1
the fish is a murasoi , which typically lives in shallow waters near reefs in the region			1
a healthy @entity111 - which shows the @entity4 fish has no obvious deformities			0

caught as part of @entity7 's scheme to *monitor* seafood near the plant
firm says nets will now be installed 20km off the coast to try and *prevent* contaminated fish migrating
fish lives in shallow reefs near the plant
comes as the two year *anniversary* of the nuclear disaster approaches
