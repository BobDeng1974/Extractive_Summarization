a farmer who was offered £ 1million to put a wind turbine on his land turned it down because he said it would blight the ' beautiful and unspoilt ' countryside			0
but now @entity6 , 54 , who farms in a @entity8 valley made famous by @entity10 's smash hit , @entity9 , faces having to see the towering device anyway , because his neighbour has agreed to host the 251ft turbine instead			1
and while it would n't have been visible to mr @entity6 if he 'd agreed to site it on his land , the proposed device will now be just 450ft away and highly visible from his house if neighbouring farmer , @entity18 , wins planning permission for it			1
@entity8 farmer @entity6 , 54 , of @entity21 , near @entity22 , turned down £ 1million for wind turbine filming @entity9 : mr @entity6 said it was a ' life - changing amount ' but he did n't want to ' blight the landscape ' mr @entity6 , who inherited his 1,800 - acre farm from his parents in 1961 , says he received offers from companies @entity30 and @entity31 to allow them to site a 500kw turbine on his @entity35 farm			1
he said he was told the device could earn him between £ 35,000 and £ 50,000 a year , or up to £ 1million over 20 years , but decided to say no as he would not be able to ' look people in the eye ' if he destroyed the land near the @entity40 , where @entity9 author , @entity10 , set his book			1
he said : ' the papers were on the table ready to be signed to give a company a two - year option , but we decided we just could not inflict such a turbine upon our neighbours and wider community			0
' it would have been a life - changing amount of money which could have financed the next step of the business , but the turbine would have towered above the hillside and been a huge blight on the landscape			2
' i did n't want to be responsible - our farm is visible from everywhere north of @entity62 and @entity63 into @entity8			0
' then mr @entity6 discovered mr @entity18 's plans for a near - identical 250ft turbine on his land next door			1
around 100 local residents are objecting to the proposed turbine , including mr @entity6 and mr @entity70 , 70 , who has become the public figurehead for the valley 's battle against turbines , describing them as a threat to its ' oasis of peace and wonder '			2
@entity80 hit : the 2011 @entity9 film was shot near around the @entity40 , near mr @entity6 's land @entity84 hills : @entity10 's book , which became a theatre production and a movie , was filmed in @entity8 mr @entity10 wrote in a letter to the local authority : ' we will have a random scattering of thousands of these huge wind turbines all over @entity8 , all over our countryside ... ' if our democracy means anything , this should not and must not be allowed			1
' the plans are currently under appeal after being rejected unanimously by @entity99 and refused planning permission by @entity101			0
mr @entity6 , who grows wheat and barley on his farm and hopes to pass the business on to his son , added : ' it is a lot of money to turn down , and i can understand why some people would take it			0
' i just feel i would like to leave my small patch of @entity113 as beautiful and unspoilt as it was when i inherited it			0
' mr @entity6 inherited the farm near @entity22 from his parents in 1961 , and hopes to pass it on to his son property developers began eyeing the @entity8 landscape last year after identifying it as a good location for a battery of new turbines , but campaigners warned the projects could ruin the scenery and wreck the tourist industry which inspired by @entity9			2
a recent map drawn up by the @entity130 revealed 11 turbines are currently in planning , with another nine in the pipeline .			0
