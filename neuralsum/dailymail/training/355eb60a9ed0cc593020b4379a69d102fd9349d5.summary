by @entity0 published : 08:29 est , 26 april 2013 updated : 04:07 est , 27 april 2013 images beamed back from @entity4 's @entity3 spacecraft have revealed meteors smashing into @entity7 's rings for the first time			1
they make @entity7 's rings the only location besides the @entity11 , the moon and @entity13 where scientists have been able to observe impacts as they occur			1
measuring from one centimetre to several metres across , the objects break into streams of rubble as they ' pummel ' the planet before kicking up clouds of debris , @entity4 scientists said			2
@entity7 's rings : the arrows indicate the clouds kicked up by the impact of the meteors			1
measuring from one centimetre to several metres across , the objects break into streams of rubble as they ' pummel ' the planet before kicking up clouds of debris , @entity4 scientists said scientists believe the meteoroids break up into streams of rubble upon hitting @entity7 's rings , creating smaller , slower pieces that enter into orbit around the planet			1
the impact of these secondary meteoroid bits kicks up the clouds , which are quickly pulled into bright , diagonal streaks			0
studying the impact rate of meteoroids from outside the @entity7 system helps its scientists to understand how different planet systems in our solar system formed , @entity4 said			2
the solar system is full of small , speeding objects which frequently pummel planetary bodies			0
it took scientists years to distinguish the tracks left by nine meteoroids in 2005 , 2009 and 2012			0
results from @entity3 have already shown @entity7 's rings act as effective detectors of many kinds of surrounding phenomena , including the interior structure of the planet and the orbits of its moons			1
for example , a subtle but extensive corrugation that ripples 12,000 miles across the innermost rings tells of a very large meteoroid impact in 1983			0
impact : @entity7 's rings are bombarded with small , speeding meteroids that break upon impact and enter into orbit around the planet shearing : this illustration shows how the cloud of debris is initially circular , but then shears as a result of the particles in the cloud having differing orbital speeds around @entity7 speeding : the meteoroids @entity3 detected crashing into @entity7 's rings are comparable in size to this one pictured hurtling over @entity82 in february ' these new results imply the current - day impact rates for small particles at @entity7 are about the same as those at @entity11 - two very different neighborhoods in our solar system - and this is exciting to see , ' said @entity91 , @entity3 project scientist at @entity4 's @entity92 in @entity93 , @entity94			1
' it took @entity7 's rings acting like a giant meteoroid detector - 100 times the surface area of the @entity11 - and @entity3 's long - term tour of the @entity7 system to address this question			1
' conditions were especially good for viewing the debris left by meteoroid impacts during the @entity7 equinox in the summer of 2009 , when the very shallow sun angle on the rings caused the clouds of debris to look bright against the darkened rings in pictures from @entity3 's imaging science subsystem			1
' we knew these little impacts were constantly occurring , but we did n't know how big or how frequent they might be , and we did n't necessarily expect them to take the form of spectacular shearing clouds , ' said @entity118 , lead author of the paper and a @entity3 participating scientist at @entity121 in @entity122 , @entity123			0
' the sunlight shining edge - on to the rings at the @entity7 equinox acted like an anti-cloaking device , so these usually invisible features became plain to see			1
' mr @entity118 and his colleagues now suspect meteoroids of this size break up on a first encounter with the rings , creating secondary meteoroids that then enter into orbit around @entity7			2
the impact into the rings of these bits kicks up the clouds			0
the tiny particles forming these clouds have a range of orbital speeds around @entity7 , and the clouds they form soon are pulled into bright , extended streaks			2
' @entity7 's rings are unusually bright and clean , leading some to suggest that the rings are actually much younger than @entity7 , ' said @entity148 , a co-author of the paper and a @entity3 interdisciplinary scientist specializing in planetary rings and dust at @entity4 's @entity153 in @entity154 , @entity94			1
' to assess this dramatic claim , we must know more about the rate at which outside material is bombarding the rings			0
this latest analysis helps fill in that story with detection of impactors of a size that we were n't previously able to detect directly			0
' long tour : an artist 's impression of the @entity3 probe , which is exploring the @entity7 system , nearing the planet 's rings the @entity3 is a cooperative project of @entity4 , the @entity171 and the @entity172			1
@entity4 's @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 , a division of the @entity173 , @entity93 , manages the @entity3 for @entity4 's @entity174 in @entity175			2
@entity92 designed , developed and assembled the @entity3 orbiter and its two onboard cameras			0
the imaging team consists of scientists from the @entity180 , @entity181 , @entity182 and @entity183			0
the imaging operations center is based at the @entity185 in @entity186 , @entity187			0
details of the observations appear in a paper in the latest edition of @entity174 .			0
