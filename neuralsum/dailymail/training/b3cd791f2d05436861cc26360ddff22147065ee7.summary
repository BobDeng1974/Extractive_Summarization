more than 2,000 people descended on a picturesque beauty spot for an illegal rave which police were not able to stop because there were too few officers on duty , it has emerged			1
revellers turned out in their droves to @entity10 in the @entity11 , near @entity12 , @entity13 , yesterday and set up camp in the @entity15 before the illegal party got underway			1
more than 400 cars and at least seven sound systems were spotted at the unlicensed gathering – which attracted people from as far away as @entity21 after word spread on social media			1
frustrated nearby residents called police complaining of the noise and ‘ serious distress ’ caused by the party , which broke out on open land near to the park ’s golf course in the early hours of sunday			1
however , despite sending officers to the scene , @entity48 said it was unable to disperse revellers and was powerless to do so			0
a spokesman said : ‘ overnight it was assessed that due to the darkness , rain , and numbers present , it was not appropriate or practical to attempt to close the gathering safely			0
‘ with daylight , officers have been re-assuring local residents that action is being taken to contain the gathering , to limit further attendance , and to seek to minimise the impact on them			2
‘ officers have been on the site and the gathering is good humoured though very noisy			2
‘ although there are powers available to the police to close down illegal gatherings such as this , before exercising these powers an assessment has to be undertaken to determine whether or not such a gathering can be closed down safely and effectively			1
‘ at present the assessment is that it would not be possible or safe to close the event down , given the number of police officers available			0
non-stop party : thousands have descended on @entity10 in @entity83 to take part in the illegal rave more than 2,000 people and 400 cars have descended on a picturesque beauty spot at @entity10 , @entity89 , near @entity12 , @entity13 for the illegal rave ( pictured ) ‘ however a presence at the location will be maintained and active measures are being taken to seek to prevent it escalating further			1
’ raves are unlicensed , illegal parties which are often held on land which is not owned by the organisers			0
they can cause a huge amount of disruption to local residents and damage to the land			0
a police spokesman added : ‘ where we can we will attend a report of a rave at the earliest opportunity to try to bring it to a safe conclusion			0
‘ when a large number of people are already at the site it is not always possible for us shut down the rave with the police resources available at that time			2
officers from @entity48 have not yet been able to stop the gathering because there have not been enough officers on duty			0
residents living near the usually peaceful @entity11 ( pictured ) have made noise complaints ‘ however we will always take action to contain the event , to reassure local residents , and work with partners such as the @entity126 and @entity127 to minimise the impact			1
‘ we are also investigating to see what offences organisers may have committed and will pursue all offences that are identified			0
