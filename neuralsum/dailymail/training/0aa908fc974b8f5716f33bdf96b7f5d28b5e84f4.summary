by @entity0 published : 10:45 est , 19 july 2013 updated : 10:45 est , 19 july 2013 thought text speak - or txt spk as it it known - was a modern phenomenon ? not if a recently unearthed collection of acerbic letters written by @entity6 @entity5 is any indication			1
the collection of more than 20 untidy handwritten notes contain a form of text speak where the monarch substituted words for abbreviations including ' wh ' for ' which ' , ' shd ' for ' should ' , ' abt ' for ' about ' and ' wd			1
' for ' would '			0
all of the correspondence , which will go under the hammer next month , is addressed to @entity20 , the man responsible for running @entity21 on her behalf			1
fascinating : the handwritten notes reveal @entity6 @entity5 's familiarity with text speak as well as her kindness considerate : the ageing monarch 's notes show her to have been a concerned employer they were written during the last four years of her life and form part of an archive worth between £ 6,000 and £ 8,000 according to the auction house			1
they show the @entity6 ’s keen interest in the welfare of her staff and tenants and continued appetite for life despite her advancing years			0
all are written on the heavy mourning paper she adopted on the death of @entity49 in 1861 and most are signed @entity51			2
they were sent from @entity53 , @entity54 , the home she shared with @entity49 , and @entity57 as well as internally at @entity21 itself			1
@entity61 book specialist @entity59 said : ' these letters throw a fascinating light on the private @entity6 @entity5 and show her to have been far kinder and more considerate than her rather forbidding public image suggested			2
' along with the letters , a collection of three handkerchiefs which carry the @entity51 monogram and a hat pin case made in bone reportedly owned by the queen will go on sale in @entity73 next month			1
but it is the intimate letters that are the source of the most excitement , not least because of the unusual abbreviations			1
@entity61 spokesman @entity79 added : ' the writing is quite untidy and the abbreviations are interesting , a sort of early form of texting which suggest queen @entity5 was a hundred years ahead of her time			2
important : the letters will go on sale alongside a collection of @entity90 memorabilia , including personal items @entity92 : all of the monarch 's letters are to @entity20 , commissioner of @entity21 ( pictured ) ' wh ' - which ' shd ' - should ' @entity96 ' - about ' @entity97 ' - would ' sales of this sort are not that rare , but what is unusual is the letters show the @entity6 was keen to strike up personal relationships with her staff , showing her concern for her household , tenants and neighbours at @entity21			1
' the letters are , in places , outspoken and give a vivid impression of the @entity6 ’s personality			2
there is a range of people who will be interested , from collectors of royal memorabilia to museums and public bodies			0
' in one @entity5 advises @entity119 on how to handle the tricky minister at @entity21 by advising him to ' be very careful to be exact & very discreet & keep out of rows ( like the choir trouble ) or writing in any of the papers wh			1
was one of mr @entity126 ’s accusations last year			0
' but i fear mr @entity128 is of a vindictive spirit & i rather fear , not very exact himself			0
at any rate you shd try & find out the story abt the free kirk minister , as i am sure that that is a " mistake "			1
' @entity5 was always solicitous about her staff whom she regarded as part of her extended family			0
on the death of @entity140 , the wife of @entity141 who was brother to the @entity6 ’s favourite , @entity143 , she wrote : ' the death of dear excellent mrs @entity146 whom i was so very fond of and with whom i had been so intimate is real grief to me & i dare not think of how dreadfully i shall miss her			0
' her loss is really irreparable ... poor @entity141 i do pity so much for he is so helpless & dear @entity140 was everything in the world to him			0
' the @entity6 ’s views of her aristocratic neighbours , however , were less charitable : ' i have never invited the @entity156 to come over with his men and i think it wd			0
be better not to do so this year			0
entail the encampment of his men in our grounds wh			2
' also included in the lot are other items that reveal @entity5 's closeness to the @entity119 family , among them a watercolour calendar illustrated with portraits of the @entity119 ’s three children and inscribed by the monarch to mrs @entity173 .			0

the monarch used abbreviations such as ' wh . ' , ' shd ' and ' abt '
letters were written to @entity21 commissioner , @entity20
collection will go under the hammer in @entity73 next month
