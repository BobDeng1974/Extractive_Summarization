the ancient mound of @entity2 was built as lighthouse and harbour to help @entity6 traders navigate waterways , an expert has claimed			1
archaeologists have long speculated that the enormous manmade structure in @entity10 was an ornate grave or a ceremonial altar used in rituals			1
but a cartographer and local historian claims he has found evidence of a stone avenue between the mound and the nearby stone circle of @entity21			1
land ahoy ! the expert a claims southern @entity24 was a series of islands linked by waterways , channels and swollen rivers , and that @entity31 was effectively located on the coast			1
the mound ( pictured ) would have acted as a lighthouse and harbour for those travelling by boat @entity38 said this suggests the hill was a lighthouse for travellers who docked at the mound and walked to the circle for goods			1
he said : ' the maps i have produced indicate that @entity21 was a trading place for our ancestors			0
' my assumption is that the nearby monument of @entity2 would have been used as a harbour , once the waters had eventually receded from the main site of @entity21			2
final destination : the cartographer and local historian claims he has found evidence of a new stone avenue between the mound and the nearby holy stone circle of @entity21 ( pictured ) mysterious : until now archaeologists and historians have speculated the huge man - made structure in @entity10 ( pictured ) was an ornate grave or a ceremonial hilltop to get closer to the gods mr @entity38 says southern @entity24 was a series of islands linked by waterways , channels and swollen rivers , and that @entity31 was effectively located on the coast			1
he believes he has discovered an avenue leading to the massive stone circle at @entity21 - an older and bigger site than @entity31			1
he said this indicates @entity2 was merely a beacon to guide people to @entity21 and added : ' this concept and use of hills are commonplace at the time of the @entity86 and thereafter , but it was not their invention			0
' the @entity89 inherited the idea from other cultures such as the @entity92 , who had their " @entity93 "			0
' we have now found our very own ' @entity95 ' , but some 2,000 years earlier			0
' ' therefore , a direct pathway would have been used from @entity2 to @entity21 for goods , which according to archaeologists does n't exist			0
' if you are going to spend years or even decades building such a construction , there has to be a social or financial reward for your endeavours			0
' we now know through recent excavations that this mound was built in stages , starting small , then getting taller			2
' if it was purely symbolic you would n't need to change the size			0
' you only change the height of this monument if it serves as a beacon to attract ships and boats to the trading place of @entity21 , for the higher you build , the greater the visible range			0
' iconic @entity2 is a 98ft ( 30 metre ) high prehistoric artificial chalk mound which is part of the @entity117			2

atmospheric : the expert claims southern @entity24 was a series of islands linked by waterways , channels and swollen rivers , and that @entity31 ( pictured ) was effectively located on the coast now he believes he has discovered an avenue leading to the massive stone circle at @entity21 - an older and bigger site than @entity31			1

archaeologists have long speculated that the enormous manmade structure in @entity10 was an ornate grave or a ceremonial altar used in rituals the @entity6 period - also known as the ' @entity6 ' - spanned from around 4000 to 2,500 @entity147 and was characterised by the adoption of agriculture and a more sedentary style of living			1
gods : new importance was placed on religion , and ritual ( @entity6 religious monument pictured ) the preceding period of the last , post-glacial hunter - gatherer societies is known as the @entity159 , or @entity160			1
to make room for the new farmland , deforestation took place which permanently transformed the landscape			0
this moment is sometimes referred to as the ' neolithic revolution ' but radiocarbon dating has revealed that the transition from hunter - gatherer to farmer was relatively gradual			2
it was believed that the introduction of farming into @entity24 was the result of a huge migration from mainland @entity177 , but genetic research suggests that the influx was probably small - somewhere around 20 per cent of the total population			1
these people also brought with them the first seed grains of wheat and barley , which had been bred from wild grasses that grew in the region of modern - day @entity187			2
new types of stone tools requiring more skill began to be produced too			0
the @entity6 also saw the construction of a wide variety of monuments in the landscape , many of which were enormous			2
the earliest of these are the chambered tombs of the early @entity6 but later stone circles were built , a trend that continued into the @entity203			1
these constructions reflect a shift in culture - a new importance that was placed on religion , ritual and social hierarchy			0
the people that lived during this period left behind no written records , however , so all that is known comes from archaeological evidence			0

it has long been speculated the huge man - made structure in @entity10 was an ornate grave or a ceremonial hilltop for religious rituals
but expert claims mound was built as lighthouse and harbour to help @entity6 traders navigate post-glacial waterways
