by @entity0 published : 08:23 est , 29 may 2013 updated : 08:29 est , 29 may 2013 a shameless motorist has had his car seized after running up a staggering £ 18,000 of parking fines in just over a year			0
the mystery driver was ticketed 220 times in different spots around a city centre after repeatedly parking without ever paying or displaying a permit			1
after each fine was ignored , officials have now lost patience and impounded the 13 - year - old light blue @entity12			0
but the £ 18,000 debt is far more than the £ 15,000 a brand new one would cost , and as this vehicle is more than a decade old it is worth substantially less			0
clampdown : this is the moment a shameless motorist 's @entity12 was seized after they ran up £ 18,000 of fines in a year - substantially more than the car is worth the saga began when the car , which is registered to a man , was first issued with a parking ticket in @entity25 , @entity26 , on february 20 , 2012			1
the driver then went on to park in a host of city council car parks and streets where a permit is required			1
when repeated efforts by @entity34 and contracted bailiffs to contact the owner failed , the hatchback was finally clamped and seized			1
the council used its parking enforcement powers to take the car as the owner failed to pay after three penalty notices and made no effort to get in touch			2
vehicles removed by the council can be destroyed if the owner does n't make contact and pay outstanding fines , including removal and storage fees			2
pledge : @entity34 ( pictured ) say they will pursue the unnamed driver through the courts to get the cash cllr @entity54 , @entity34 's cabinet member for traffic and transportation , explained why they seized the car			1
he said : ' this is an extreme case which is why we have taken the necessary action to seize the vehicle after a blatant disregard by the owner			0
in addition to seizing the vehicle we will pursue legal action to recover the outstanding debt owned			2
' @entity69 , @entity34 's parking manager , insisted the council will continue to pursue the owner until they pay back the 18,000 pounds			1
he said : ' although the car has been seized we wo n't give up pursuing the owner until they come forward and the outstanding debt is settled			0
' the amount of fines this motorist ran up shows a lack of respect for all road users , so we used our enforcement powers to take action against this persistent offender			0

@entity25 parker has *refused* to pay or show permit since february 2012
@entity34 say they will pursue the driver through the courts for the cash
