by @entity0 offenders ordered to do unpaid work rather than go to prison see it as an easy option , and many do n't even bother to turn up for all of it , new research shows			1
a @entity9 report found that 82 per cent of offenders saw community service orders , which covered menials tasks such as clearing local parks , cleaning graffiti , or cleaning the streets , as less harsh than going to prison			1
despite this , nearly three - quarters ( 70 per cent ) of those given unpaid work missed at least a day of it , and 14 per cent said they had missed most of it			1
soft option : most offenders given community orders say they are easier than going to prison ( file image ) and their failure to attend largely went unpenalised : court action was taken in less than half the number of cases of those who failed to attend their unpaid work			1
and only 21 per cent of offenders questioned for the @entity9 survey , which questioned offenders over 18 who were given community orders , said the fear of getting another community order would stop them reoffending in future			1
the research found that 77 per cent of offenders who had been to prison before thought that prison would have been a worse punishment than a community order , while 87 per cent of offenders who had not been to prison felt that way			2
today , a think - tank said community punishments should be harsher to ensure they did deter would - be criminals and change behaviour			0
@entity55 from the @entity56 said : ' unpaid work requirements must be far more demanding and intensive if they are to deter criminals and command public confidence			2
' we need a competent probation system that actually changes behaviour			0
' the best way to do that is to reform the system so that there is a rigorous focus on compliance and a serious effort to punish infractions in a rapid and consistent way			0
' more than 70 per cent of those told to do unpaid work admit to having missed at least a day of it ( file image ) but justice minister @entity75 said community sentences were being ' toughened up '			1
he said : ' hard - working taxpayers expect those convicted of committing crime to be punished accordingly			0
' victims must be confident that offenders will pay a price for their crimes , which is why we have toughened up community sentences to now include a punitive element in all adult community sentences			2
' since 2010 criminals are also more likely to go to prison , and for longer			0
' step by step we 're overhauling sentencing and sending a clear message to criminals - if you break the law , you will be punished			0

vast *majority* of criminals see community sentences as easier than prison
@entity9 research says 82 per cent believe unpaid work is easier
but 70 per cent admit to having missed at least a day of community order
and of those who breached their orders , less than half faced court action
@entity56 think tank : make unpaid work harder to be real deterrent
