by @entity0 the transfer of @entity2 to @entity3 may have given @entity5 manager @entity4 the hard cash to make it a record - breaking summer of transfers at @entity8			1
but the signing of @entity11 forward @entity10 has been in the pipeline long before the arrival of @entity4 at the club			1
the versatility of a player often likened to former @entity18 legend @entity17 was what made ex-reds boss @entity20 enquire about @entity10 ’s availability way back in 2011			2
he smashed six in 13 starts for a struggling @entity35 side eventually relegated from the top flight and bagged 14 in 24 starts for @entity27 last season			0
@entity4 himself went after the @entity45 in january this year and again in march - long before @entity2 departed for @entity46			1
the forward ’s goal return is clearly a draw as @entity4 seeks to fill the 31 - goal gap left by the @entity51			2
crucially , though , @entity10 will also provide the pace , ability and willingness to play in any position forward of deep midfield , which appeals to the @entity58 ’s desire for his players to be interchangeable in a fluid , rotating system			2
in and out : @entity10 will not be able to fill @entity2 's shoes but he will offer @entity5 a different type of option versatile : the @entity45 striker 's pace and ability to play across the front line is a key factor in his signing it was this ability to take up any role asked of him - coupled with blistering pace - which made @entity10 a much better bet that @entity76			1
although primarily a striker , he can operate anywhere across the front line			0
@entity10 featured in five different positions for @entity27 last season and that is a clear sign he will fit into a @entity5 attacking system that is likely to have @entity87 as its beating heart but with a mix - and - match group of players as its lifeblood			1
@entity93 assumed a key role during @entity5 ’s title challenge last season after learning to be more flexible , while @entity96 earned rave reviews in the latter half of the season after showing a similar willingness to adapt			1
key role : @entity96 is one of the @entity5 players who functioned so well behind the strikers last year key pair : @entity2 and @entity87 formed an excellent partnership last season , something @entity10 wants to emulate rarely did they get in each others ’ way as @entity5 smashed goals with abandon at the height of their resurgence ; @entity10 will be equally expected to work out his place in this grand scheme			1
there will be inevitable moments of confusion when @entity87 and @entity10 both pull wide and deep , or chase the same balls into the box			1
but @entity4 will trust them to come good , in time			2
the @entity5 manager would not have spent the £ 8.5m on @entity10 if he were not confident there will be no long - term clash of styles , no fighting for the same positions			1
it was a similar train of thought with the purchase of @entity132 from @entity133 last month			0
@entity4 has always been happy to compliment how well his front line complement			2
@entity10 ’s arrival will not change that			0
@entity137 : @entity93 and @entity87 used their pace to rip teams apart last season irreplaceable : no one player was ever going to be signed to make up for the @entity51 leaving with @entity10 now signing on the dotted line for @entity5 , the work of his agent , @entity146 , would appear done			1
@entity147 has previously wasted no opportunity suggesting his player would be he perfect match for @entity5 , but his sales - pitch from 2011 would appear to be perfectly aimed at @entity4 now			1
' this boy is pure gold , ' he said			0
' and i am not just saying that because i am his agent			0
' he has great pace and that is something @entity5 need in attack			0
he has his heart set on playing for @entity5			2
' if @entity147 ’s high - praise should come with the obvious health - warning of somebody pedalling self - interest , the words of former @entity5 defender @entity162 perhaps carry more credibility			0
back in may this year , the @entity169 pundit was proclaiming @entity10 as an ideal signing for the @entity171			0
rebuilding : @entity4 has already brought in several stars to fill the whole left by @entity2 ' personally , i would take him all day long , ' he was reported as saying			1
' he would provide a perfect option as he is such a good player			0
' @entity162 was commenting in the knowledge that @entity5 will be tested by a challenge for honours on four fronts next season following their return to the @entity182			0
prior to joining @entity35 in january 2013 , @entity10 was a regular for @entity183 in the @entity182 , scoring four goals in 16 appearances in the competition			0
he also played for the @entity45 club in the @entity188			0
in buying @entity10 , nobody , especially , @entity4 will believe he has signed a direct replacement for @entity2			1
but the @entity190 perhaps knows now more than ever , following the disappointment from by the antics of its greatest individual performer last season , that @entity5 ’s strength next term will come from the sum of its parts .			0

@entity10 set to join @entity5 of £ *8.5million*
@entity4 impressed with striker 's versatility
@entity45 will not play instead of @entity87 but could support him from the flanks along with @entity93 and @entity96
@entity2 joined @entity3 for £ 75m
