@entity0 earned himself the opportunity to gain some revenge for what happened at @entity4 last year after an almost uninterrupted cruise into the last 16 of the @entity6			1
the world no 6 now gets a shot at gifted @entity10 @entity9 after swatting away @entity12 's @entity11 like he was one of the irritating flies one finds in these parts			1
@entity0 took two hours and six minutes to overcome the world no 55 6 - 1 6 - 1 7 - 5 , and now has a match against the player who knocked him out of last summer 's @entity18 quarter - final in straight sets			1
@entity0 was , for the most part , in imperious form over on the @entity41 and played with real aggression			2
he will need to reproduce that positive outlook to get past world @entity45 , who often draws comparisons with the great @entity47			0
' it should be a good match , he has improved a lot over the last few years , ' said @entity0 of a player who he beat when they last played , at the @entity53 , indoors in november			2
@entity0 was pleased with his afternoon 's work : ' @entity11 came back into it and played some great shots at the end			2
my body feels good , although you know it 's going to get tougher with every round			0
' @entity9 needed to summon up all his resolve to get past @entity64 's @entity63 , and took a sapping three hours and 28 minutes before winning 4 - 6 6 - 3 3 - 6 6 - 3 6 - 3			1
@entity0 by contrast was in complete control bar a brief period in the third set , when his concentration slightly faltered at 4 - 1 up			1
@entity0 will have to improve his serving if he is to go stand a chance of winning the tournament @entity0 's groundstrokes were often sublime however and left @entity11 with little answer @entity75 was in her usual position courtside to watch her fiance make short work of @entity11 he had needed to save an early break point in the third game of the opener , when he served two double faults			1
from then on he powered ahead , not dropping a further game in the first against @entity11 , who needed treatment on his his upper leg when he went 4 - 1 down in the second			1
he looked in pain , but seemed to move well thereafter			0
he could make no inroads , despite @entity0 's first serve percentage dropping to 43 in the second			0
the @entity41 , a multi-sport venue , is not the most atmospheric , but the excitement levels rose when a revitalised @entity11 mounted a fightback when his cause seemed lost			0
he broke back for 4 - 3 and , loudly exhorting himself , struck out with nothing left to lose			0
@entity0 needed to reassert himself and , and remained admirably disciplined , even when two match points went begging at 5 - 4			1
he headed off the threat of a tiebreak with a final break of serve , and reaches the fourth round having expended the minimum of energy			0
that is just as well for , even with @entity20 out , sterner tests are coming now , beginning on sunday			0
@entity0 's coach @entity108 appeared happy with her charge 's work as he made it through @entity0 's mum was also there having earlier watched her other son , @entity114 , triumph in the doubles @entity0 was cheered on by usual colourful support on another warm day in @entity24			2

@entity0 needed just over two hours to beat @entity11
the @entity121 no 1 triumphed 6 - 1 , 6 - 1 , 7 - 5 in @entity24
@entity0 will now face old rival @entity9 in the last 16
the @entity10 earlier beat @entity63 in a five - set *thriller*
