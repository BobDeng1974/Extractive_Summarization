six @entity1 faith schools in @entity2 are expected to be branded inadequate today over fears that they are not preparing pupils for life in modern @entity6			1
in a memo to education secretary @entity10 , @entity8 inspectors are expected to highlight ‘ serious concerns ’			1
they will also criticise a leading state school in the same east @entity2 borough after it emerged that sixth - formers used a @entity16 page to post references to sheikh @entity18 , an @entity19 preacher who has called homosexuality a ‘ disease ’ and a ‘ repugnant shameless sin ’			1
sir @entity40 , the head of @entity8 , will publish a series of reports on schools in @entity44 today alongside the advice note to mrs @entity46			1
@entity8 is expected to say it has ‘ serious concerns ’ over sir @entity32 and the six private @entity1 faith schools			2
the watchdog will claim that the lack of a broad and balanced curriculum in the six faith schools was preparing pupils poorly for life in modern @entity6 , according to the advice note leaked to @entity57			0
in all six schools , pupils ’ physical and educational welfare were also at serious risk , inspectors said			0
the schools focused intensively on developing @entity19 knowledge at the expense of other important subjects on the curriculum , it is claimed			0
inspectors noted very limited opportunities to learn about history and geography other than those aspects relating to @entity19			1
music , drama and art were rarely taught			0
@entity8 will today condemn the sir @entity32 school , which was previously rated as ‘ oustanding ’ , for failing to protect pupils from extremism			1
inspectors are expected to accuse staff of failing to act on police warnings about social media sites produced by a sixth - form islamic society at the school			1
they are likely to warn that @entity19 society @entity16 pages are linked to individuals associated with extremist activity			1
pages still available online show that pupils cited @entity89 , an @entity90 preacher who has voiced explicitly anti-gay views			0
on his own @entity16 page , @entity89 , a scholar at a conservative @entity19 teaching institute , asked followers : ‘ when @entity95 describes homosexuality as a repugnant shameless sin and details his punishment of a people that practised sodomy , how can anyone who believes in @entity95 not find it immoral ? ’ he also said : ‘ if as @entity1 we do n’t take a clear stance on this , we will be forced to conform and watch this disease destroy our children			0
’ in a separate posting , he said : ‘ practising homosexuality is a sin like adultery , drinking , etc. the sin should be condemned , and the sinner should be called to the path of the @entity115			0
’ it does not appear that pupils at sir @entity32 quoted these particular comments but referred to the sheikh in a different context			0
report : the school ( pictured ) , which has failed its inspection as a result , is the first institution outside @entity38 to fail on such a safeguarding issue since the so - called @entity36 plot was uncovered sir @entity32 ’s headmaster @entity127 ( above ) is said to have been ‘ shell - shocked ’ by the developments quotes posted from the sheikh refer to how the @entity19 faith can ease the pain of grief			2
@entity8 is expected to criticise a lack of monitoring of a @entity138 channel set up by the @entity19 society			1
further criticisms are expected to centre on playground segregation of boys and girls , which the school says is an historical arrangement			1
in 2008 , @entity8 estimated 93 per cent of the school ’s intake was from ethnic minority groups , with two - thirds from @entity152 backgrounds			2
about 80 per cent of students were classed as bilingual			0
the school , once one of the lowest - performing in the country , was transformed into one of @entity6 ’s most successful inner - city comprehensives by head @entity127			0
it was graded ‘ outstanding ’ by @entity8 in its last two inspections , but it will be put into special measures for failing to safeguard pupils			1
there were claims from local education sources last night that @entity8 was ‘ over-reacting ’ to problems in @entity44 , which they said were different from the @entity36 affair			0
‘ there are no governors wanting to take over the school and introduce hardline @entity19 practices , ’ said one			2
@entity175 , director of education at @entity176 , said : ‘ where any issues in our maintained schools do occur , we have a strong record of intervening swiftly and successfully to address them			0
