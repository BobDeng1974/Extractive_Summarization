called @entity6 , the firm has turned to @entity8 , where it funded its original watch , for the £ $ 199 colour version			1
the campaign has already been a huge success - with @entity0 hitting its target in just seventeen minutes			1
' at its heart , @entity6 is an awesome watch , ' the firm says			1
' the new color e-paper display is easy to read and always - on , perfect for displaying incoming notifications and your favorite watchface			1
' @entity0 hopes the battery life of its watch will be a major selling point - both the @entity28 and @entity5 's @entity31 watches need to be recharged every night			2
' compared with display technology like lcd or @entity35 , power consumption is minimized , enabling @entity6 to achieve an industry - leading battery life of up to 7 days			0
' however , the screen is far lower resolution , and can only display 64 colours			2
' it 's not going to break any records for number of pixels or whatever , ' @entity0 of @entity0 told @entity45			0
' but it does what it has to do to be on a smart watch			2
' it 's color , it 's always on and it uses , for all intents and purposes , the exact same power as our black - and - white display			0
' the watch will also be able to be fitted with any standard watch strap the watch is also far thinner , at just 9.5mm			2
' its ergonomic , curved design fits comfortably on either wrist and slides easily under dress shirts , ' the firm says			1

' the device looks to have a larger bezel , as well as buttons that are smaller compared to its predecessor			0
' as we reported , the watch is going to be thinner than the current generation , but you ca n't really see that based on this image alone			2
the new watch is also far thinner , at just 9.5mm			2

on the inside , the next @entity0 is going to have a @entity103 processor and a 6 - axis gyroscope			0

weight : @entity158 @entity159 : £ 99 ( $ 99 in the @entity160 ) and £ 180 ( $ 199 ) for the @entity0 model			0
the current watch allows wearers to read texts and tweets on their wrist , as well as see incoming calls , check the weather , access fitness apps and tell the time			1
it is compatible with @entity4 and @entity31 devices and connects to a smartphone via @entity114 so users do n't have to rummage in their handbag or pockets for their phone to see app notifications and messages , because they appear on the watch 's screen			1
