@entity1 striker @entity0 has been in sensational form since arriving at @entity3 from @entity4			1
seven goals in four games , the best start by any player to life in the @entity10 , have seen him establish himself as @entity12 's star performer			0
but , with respect to the likes of @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 , he had not , until sunday , come up against a defender of the quality of @entity20			1
click here to see @entity0 and @entity20 's key battles in our brilliant match zone @entity20 and @entity0 go shoulder to shoulder as the league 's top scorer faced a tough test in the first half @entity0 spent more time in his own penalty area than anywhere else on the pitch @entity0 tackles @entity33 , as the @entity1 striker spent much of the first hour defending rather than attacking it was always going to be intriguing to see how the @entity36 coped when up against a truly world class defender , and , in the first half at least , the answer was plain			1
isolated up front on his own @entity0 saw very little of the ball and did n't manage a single shot in the first 45 minutes			1
only once did he escape his @entity44 opponent , on the stroke of half time , but the slightest touch from @entity48 prevented @entity0 from scoring after @entity50 's knock - down from a corner			2
@entity20 emerges from yet another duel with @entity0 with the ball as the @entity36 struggled when the ball finally did come to @entity0 in the @entity56 area he was both offside and fired wide up until @entity58 's red card the @entity1 striker had been unable to have any significant impact on the game in fact , in the first half , the @entity62 striker spent more time in his own penalty area than @entity65 's			1
much of this was down to @entity12 's tactical set - up			0
@entity68 , the supplier - in - chief thus far for @entity0 's goals , was rarely close enough to him to provide			2
when @entity68 did get forward and try and feed @entity0 , @entity20 was there , to intercept , to tackle , to stifle			1
@entity72 and @entity73 offered energy in midfield , but scarcely made it into the @entity65 half , as @entity12 's plan to soak up pressure blunted not only @entity65 , but also his own attack			0
eventually , early in the second half , it looked like @entity0 may get a chance			2
when the ball found him in the @entity65 penalty area , however , he was both offside and unable to find the target			0
@entity0 tangles with @entity58 as the striker continues to be a nuisance despite little service the two players are pulled apart but @entity0 's damage had been done and @entity58 was sent off the frustration was clearly boiling over , but @entity0 still had the nuisance factor which resulted in @entity58 's red card			1
before that moment , @entity0 had been involved in 10 duels with @entity65 players and lost all of them			2
but , with the increased space , and the onus on @entity1 to come forward , the striker was finally in the game			0
@entity0 played a key part in @entity105 's goal and the @entity62 striker was quick to celebrate @entity0 may have had a quiet game , but he played a crucial part in @entity105 's goal by the time he was substituted @entity0 's influence had grown but he was still outclassed by @entity20 it was @entity0 who drove at the @entity65 defence before feeding @entity113 who crossed for @entity105 's pivotal goal			1
and , as the game wore on , he even managed an effort on target ( only @entity1 's second of the game ) , a header straight into the hands of @entity122 , before striking the post with by far his best effort of the game			0
it was fitting that @entity65 were back level by the time @entity0 was eventually removed			0
denied the service he thrives on , he never offered enough against @entity20 to earn the win .			0
