@entity0 won so many medals at the @entity2 in @entity3 — 174 in all and 58 gold , comfortably the most of the 71 competing nations — that it was easy to become complacent			1
‘ oh look , we ’ve picked up another one in the lawn bowls ’			1
the nation topped the medals table in boxing , diving , gymnastics , triathlon and judo , where they were level with @entity19			1
@entity0 also came second in squash , cycling , table tennis , hockey , power - lifting , shooting and swimming			1
the numbers are so mind - boggling it does n’t seem to mean very much after a while ( as long as @entity0 are ahead of @entity31 , of course )			1
that is not to disparage the men and women who have stood proudly on the podium , for you can only beat the opponent in front of you , but such enormous success deserves some context			0
there is no showman in sport like @entity51 — and how athletics needs him			0
thought we are in a dangerous place when a positive test from a 16 - year - old weightlifter — @entity66 ’s @entity65 — was heralded as a sign that sport is winning the war on drugs			2
it is not the teenager who should be hung out to dry for having a diuretic and a masking agent in her system , but those who helped her get them			0
watched live squash for the first time — and thought it was brilliant			0
fast , feisty , demanding extraordinary levels of fitness and with equal medals on offer for men and women — how is it not an @entity54 sport and golf is ? will the might of the @entity92 and @entity93 , who finished first and second in the medals table at @entity96 , be losing sleep as they try and make sense of this slightly odd , antiquated 11 - day festival of sport the @entity103 monarch rules over every four years ? it is doubtful			1
nearly half of @entity0 ’s medals came in the ‘ optional ’ sports at these games ; disciplines that a host nation can choose to include depending on how good they are at them , essentially			1
this seems an entirely fitting approach for a competition made up of countries that once belonged to the @entity116 , mind you			0
we ’re going to put on a rather nice sports day , but we ’re only going to play the games we like			1
now would you like some tea ? judo , triathlon and gymnastics came into this category in 2014 , but @entity3 could equally have picked ten - pin bowling or softball if they had really wanted to wind up their neighbours across the border			1
thankfully , @entity19 recognised that home nations success would sell , and the @entity2 have been a better spectacle for it			0
but , as thoughts turn to the @entity135 in @entity136 , rallying cries about @entity103 ’s chances of success must be measured			2
@entity142 ’ score to win gold on the pommel horse , for example , was the one gymnastics display that would have been worthy of a medal — bronze — at @entity96			2
there were four pairs entered for the men ’s 10m synchronised diving event , so only gold and silver medals were awarded			1
the season ’s bests which @entity156 , who missed the games with a foot injury , set in 2014 would have been good enough to win the women ’s heptathlon , high jump and long jump in @entity3			2
success : @entity164 is pictured with her four @entity166 gold medals at the @entity167 video @entity3 a ' stand - out games ' - @entity42 right direction : @entity170 picked up a bronze medal at the @entity2 so many to choose from			1
i loved seeing @entity19 @entity173 , @entity174 and @entity175 defy the burden of home pressure to reach the podium			0
equally thrilling was watching 40 - year - old @entity179 take it to the @entity181 in the 5,000m , just 10 months after giving birth to her second child			0
it is not realistic to frame these games as the pinnacle of sporting achievement — we should celebrate them as an entertaining stepping stone			0
they can then keep the joyous peculiarities of a 79 - year - old playing lawn bowls or a chap from the @entity197 being lapped three times in the 5,000m final and yet still retain their relevance			0
it ’s been thrilling to see home - grown youngsters grasp their opportunities with no @entity93 , @entity92 or @entity205 competitors to get in the way , and then immediately talk of how these @entity2 will be a springboard for future success			2
think of 16 - year - old gymnast @entity164 ( left ) and her four gold medals ; @entity170 , who beat fellow scot @entity211 to win 200m breaststroke gold ; or sprinter @entity44 , who won two silvers			1
it is athletes like these we should pick out when trying to make sense of that dizzyingly successful medal table			0
the brilliantly bonkers stories about the endless list of husband - and - wife partnerships are what make the @entity2 unique , but these tales could also be its downfall if you start analysing the standard of some of the sports too closely			0
the @entity229 ’ wonderful inclusivity — the thought that , actually , you could be capable of being on the @entity231 in four years ’ time if you could find a not - too - distant relative in @entity233 — has played a key part in its success			0
but it is the platform it has provided for some of our stars of the future that will see it endure			2
@entity242 and @entity243 , two sprinters back after serving doping bans , were accused of ‘ ruining the whole season ’ by a fan on @entity248			2
gay hit back , saying ‘ ok lol ’ , while @entity242 ’s advice was ‘ turn your tv off then ’			1
both will run at the well - paid @entity255 circuit in @entity256 in september .			0

@entity0 topped the medals table in boxing , diving , gymnastics and judo
nearly half of @entity0 ’s medals came in the ‘ optional ’ sports at these games
@entity44 , @entity164 and @entity170 are all future stars
