by @entity0 published : 09:13 est , 30 january 2013 updated : 09:45 est , 30 january 2013 a boys ' school is planning to introduce a controversial new anti-drugs policy that will see hair samples collected from students for random testing			1
around 60 strands of hair will be taken from each of a group of randomly selected pupils at @entity11 in @entity12 , @entity13 , to be tested for cocaine , @entity15 , marijuana and other substances			1
participation in the scheme , set to be introduced at the @entity21 school at the start of the 2013/14 academic year , will be mandatory			2
new policy : hair samples will be taken from students at @entity11 in @entity12 for random drug testing a member of staff @entity11 who is a barber will be tasked with collecting their hair , which will be taken away and assessed for evidence of banned substances or alcohol abuse over the preceding 90 days			1
' our point is , if we do encounter a student who has made some bad decisions with drugs or alcohol , we will be able to intervene , get the parents involved , get him help if necessary , and then help him get back on a path of better decision making , healthier choices for his life , ' @entity11 principal @entity49 told local news website @entity51			2
any student who tests positive will be given a 90 - day period to be drug - free			2
the guidance councillor assigned to that pupil will be notified , and will meet with the student and their parents for a discussion over how best to help the boy concerned			0
under the new policy , the incident will be noted in the student 's guidance file , but no administrative personnel will be informed			0
the file is destroyed upon graduation and its contents are not sent to colleges or universities			0
testing : strands of hair collected from @entity73 students will be tested for evidence of the use of cocaine , @entity15 , opiates , marijuana and other substances the school decided to introduce the new policy after carrying out a survey of its students that revealed pupils ' perceptions about drug use among their classmates were far removed from reality			1
' what was most alarming for us is that when you asked our students if everyone else is doing it , they said " yes "			0
but , in fact , they were n't , ' mr @entity49 said , adding that the misconception was fuelling peer pressure among teenagers			0
' ... there 's this idea that " everyone is doing it , so i guess i have to do it myself " , ' the teacher said			0
mr @entity49 - who said almost all parents of @entity11 students were ' on board ' - said the policy was also being introduced in light of the impact of addiction and intoxication on the brain development of teenagers			1
the new rules will come into force at the start of the new academic year following two years of discussions among staff , administrators and parents			0
the school 's junior class president @entity123 said while some pupils were ' impressed ' by the steps taken by @entity11 to address the possibility to substance abuse , others regarded the impending drug testing as an invasion of privacy .			1
