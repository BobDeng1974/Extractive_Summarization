that 's all i can say			0
' @entity3 stopped at the @entity58 , which he founded , on his way to the interview and said , ' i 'm sorry ' to staff members , some of whom broke down in tears			1
a person with knowledge of that session said @entity3 choked up and several employees cried during the session			2
the person also said @entity3 apologized for letting the staff down and putting livestrong at risk but he did not make a direct confession to using banned drugs			2
he said he would try to restore the foundation 's reputation , and urged the group to continue fighting for the charity 's mission of helping cancer patients and their families			0

' after a federal investigation of the cyclist was dropped without charges being brought last year , @entity18 stepped in with an investigation of its own			0

speaking : @entity3 pictured in october addressing participants at @entity116 at the @entity117 in @entity31 @entity3 seemed calm and joked with reporters outside his @entity31 , @entity32 home over the weekend the interview with @entity5 will be @entity3 's first public response to the @entity18 report			1
@entity3 is not expected to provide a detailed account about his involvement , nor address in depth many of the specific allegations in the more than 1,000 - page @entity18 report			1
after he was stripped of his tour titles , @entity3 defiantly tweeted a picture of himself on a couch at home with all seven of the yellow leader 's jerseys on display in frames behind him			1
but the preponderance of evidence in the @entity18 report and pending legal challenges on several fronts apparently forced him to change tactics , and he still faces legal challenges			0

@entity3 is in discussions with the @entity152 to possibly testify in a federal whistle - blower case			2
former teammate @entity154 , who was stripped of the @entity156 title for doping , has filed a federal whistle - blower lawsuit that accused @entity3 of defrauding the @entity101			2

better days : the interview , which will take place at @entity3 's home , will be broadcast thursday on the @entity171 the @entity173 - based @entity172 also is suing @entity3 to recover about $ 500,000 it paid him to settle a libel lawsuit			1
on sunday , the newspaper took out a full - page ad in the @entity177 , offering @entity5 suggestions for what questions to ask @entity3			1
@entity181 - based @entity180 , which tried to deny @entity3 a promised bonus for a @entity8 win , has threatened to bring yet another lawsuit seeking to recover more than $ 7.5 million an arbitration panel awarded the cyclist in that dispute			1
the lawsuit most likely to be influenced by a confession might be the @entity172 case			0
potential perjury charges stemming from @entity3 's sworn testimony in the 2005 arbitration fight would not apply because of the statute of limitations			1
@entity3 was not deposed during the federal investigation that was closed last year			2
@entity3 's @entity5 appearance will be the cyclist 's first public response to the @entity18 report many of his sponsors dropped @entity3 after the damning @entity18 report — at the cost of tens of millions of dollars — and soon after , he left the board of the @entity58 cancer - fighting charity he founded in 1997			1
@entity3 is still said to be worth about $ 100 million			0
@entity58 could be one reason @entity3 has decided to come forward with an apology and limited confession			0
the charity supports cancer patients and still faces an image problem because of its association with @entity3			0
he may be hoping that his willingness to testify against the cycling union officials and his former team ’s officials and his confession will allow him to return to competition in the elite triathlon or running events he participated in after his cycling career			0
@entity223 rules state his lifetime ban can not be reduced to less than eight years			0
@entity223 and @entity228 anti-doping officials could agree to reduce the ban further depending on what information @entity3 provides and his level of cooperation he had a meeting last month with @entity18 officials , and it was reported by @entity150 that people with knowledge of the discussions said the officials would be willing to reduce @entity3 ’s punishment if @entity3 would testify against the people who helped him dope .			0
