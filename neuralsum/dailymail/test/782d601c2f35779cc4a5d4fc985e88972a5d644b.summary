the @entity0 could be suffering from shifts in its biochemical balance similar to those believed to have wiped out half of all life 200 million years ago			1
this is according to a @entity9 study that has discovered a catastrophic condition called ' marine photic zone euxinia ' took place in one of the prehistoric oceans			1
this happens when the sun - lit surface waters of the ocean become devoid of oxygen and are poisoned by hydrogen sulphide			1
life of the @entity22 met a choking end in a runaway greenhouse climate , heating the seas into warm stagnation , according to a new study			1
pictured is an artist 's impression of what may have happened in the oceans 200 million years ago			0
the study authors fear that the planet today could suffer similar consequences hydrogen sulphide is a by - product of micro-organisms that live without oxygen and is extremely toxic to most other lifeforms			1
the study authors fear that the planet today could suffer similar consequences caused by the amount of carbon dioxide being created through the burning of fossil fuels			1

the rocks are now exposed on the @entity56 , off the coast of @entity58 , @entity59 the experts found signs of bacteria which had suffered severe oxygen depletion and hydrogen sulphide poisoning which would have been caused by massive volcanic rifts in the @entity0 's tectonic plates			1
' as tectonic plates shifted to break up @entity54 , huge volcanic rifts would have spewed carbon dioxide into the atmosphere , leading to rising temperatures from the greenhouse effect , ' said professor @entity76			1
' the rapid rises in @entity78 would have triggered changes in ocean circulation , acidification and deoxygenation			2
the @entity52 was the vast global ancestral @entity83 that surrounded the supercontinent @entity54 , during the @entity85 and the early @entity87 eras ' these changes have the potential to disrupt nutrient cycles and alter food chains essential for the survival of marine ecosystems			2
our data now provides direct evidence that anoxic , and ultimately euxinic , conditions severely affected food chains			0
' the same @entity78 rise that led to the oxygen - depleted oceans also led to a mass extinction on land , and ultimately to the ecological takeover by dinosaurs , although the mechanisms are still under study			2
' she explained that although the @entity0 was very different during the @entity22 period , the rate of carbon dioxide release from volcanic rifts are similar to those we are experiencing now through the burning of fossil fuels			1
professor @entity76 added : ' the release of @entity78 was probably at least as rapid as that caused by the burning of fossil fuels today , although the initial concentrations were much higher in the @entity22			1
' the consequences of rapidly rising co2 in ancient times inform us of the possible consequences of our own carbon dioxide crisis			2
' meteor impacts contributed to wiping out species during mass extinction events on @entity0 @entity132 - @entity131 mass extinction - 443.4 million years ago this was the third largest extinction in @entity0 's history , and had two peaks of dying separated by hundreds of thousands of years			0
around 26 per cent of all marine families were wiped out and 60 per cent of all genera - an estimated 82 - 88 per cent of all species			2
late @entity141 mass extinction - 375 - 359 million years ago three quarters of all species on @entity0 died out in the @entity144 , though it may have been a series of extinctions over several million years			0
around 22 per cent of all marine families , and 57 per cent of all genera were wiped out - an estimated 79 - 87 per cent of all species			2
permian mass extinction - 252 million years ago the @entity151 mass extinction has been nicknamed @entity152 , since an incredible 96 per cent of species died out			0
all life on @entity0 today is descended from the 4 per cent of species that survived			0
@entity22 - @entity156 mass extinction - 201 million years ago there were two or three phases of extinction that made up the @entity22 - @entity156 mass extinction event			1
22 per cent of all marine families and 53 per cent of all genera - an estimated 76 - 84 per cent of all species			0
@entity165 - tertiary mass extinction - 66 million years ago the @entity167 mass extinction was the event that wiped out the dinosaurs			0
however , many other organisms perished including 16 per cent of all marine families and 47 per cent of all genera - an estimated 71 - 81 per cent of all species .			0

the rate of co2 released from burning fossil fuels has *increased*
it is now similar to levels released from volcanic rifts during @entity22
this created *disastrous* condition dubbed ' marine photic zone euxinia '
this happens when surface ocean waters become devoid of oxygen
