an amateur photographer has captured an eerie photo from the shore of @entity3 which could encourage those who believe in tales of a monster living beneath the surface of the lake			2
the image was taken by @entity10 at @entity11 , at the south - west end of the 23 - mile - long body of water in northern @entity15			1
it shows a long bow wave apparently caused by some sort of disturbance on the surface of the loch			0
mr @entity10 , from @entity29 in @entity30 , was able to take still photos as well as filming a video of the mysterious scene			1
' we were at the pier head at @entity11 and i was taking a picture of a swan at the time , ' he said			1
' out of the corner of my right eye i caught site of a black area of water about 15ft long which developed into a kind of bow wave			1
' i 'm convinced this was caused by a solid black object under the water			1
the water was very still at the time and there were no ripples coming off the wave and no other activity on the water			0
' @entity57 was definitely going over something solid and making the wave			0
it looks like the sort of wave perhaps created by a windsurfing board but there was nobody on the loch at the time , no boats , nothing			0
' the disturbance in the water began moving up the @entity3 sideways			0
it is something i just ca n't explain			0
' the extraordinary picture will doubtless fuel the imaginations of anyone who believes the story that there is a sea creature living in the lake , which is @entity82 's largest due to its 230m depth			2
however , sceptics will ascribe the wave to a freak gust of wind or other natural phenomenon			0
iconic : this is the ' surgeon 's photograph ' taken in 1934 which purports to show the @entity90 the story of the @entity90 goes back as far as the medieval period , but it first came to widespread public attention in 1933			1
that year a couple named the @entity95 claimed to have seen a creature with a large body and long neck jumped in to the loch , causing a national sensation			0
the next year , the iconic ' surgeon 's photograph ' was published , purporting to show the creature swimming in @entity3 with its head out of the water			2
although that image has been debunked as a hoax , the search for @entity90 has continued , with true believers undeterred by the failure of repeated attempts by scientists to find the creature .			1

@entity10 , 50 , takes mysterious picture while photographing a swan
insists the image must show ' a solid black object under the water '
new photo will fuel theories about the existence of the @entity90
