@entity0 would be teetering on the edge of the relegation zone were it not for summer signing @entity3			1
the £ 30million man brought in from @entity6 has virtually been single - handedly keeping @entity8 's side competitive with his goals and assists this season			1
although this has been far from a vintage @entity0 season and they sit sixth in the table , were it not for @entity3 's crucial contribution of eight goals and two assists they would be in 17th on 10 points			1
@entity3 celebrates after scoring for @entity0 against @entity22 at the @entity23 on sunday @entity3 ( centre ) scores the opening goal of the match but @entity0 went on to lose 2 - 1 to @entity22 @entity3 's stats for 2014 - 15 matches 10 goals 8 minutes per goal 98 assists 2 chances created 24 @entity32 only , stats via @entity33 @entity3 has earned them an extra seven points already this campaign			1
against @entity37 he set up @entity38 to turn a 1 - 1 draw into a win and his double against @entity42 secured victory			2
he scored versus @entity44 and @entity45 to salvage a point in both games and earned them one more against @entity48 by scoring and setting up @entity50 's last - minute equaliser			2
the @entity52 's form is up there with the best , with 12 goals in his last 14 games in all competitions and it appears @entity8 has found the goal - scorer he needed			1
' his quality is exceptional , he takes responsibility and goes at people			2
he fights , he can score , that is what you want from great players , ' @entity8 has said this season			2
@entity3 ( centre ) takes on @entity22 duo @entity66 ( left ) and @entity67 during sunday 's match @entity3 ( left ) is challenged by @entity69 as he looks to advance with the ball at the @entity23 @entity3 gets in between @entity72 's defenders to head @entity0 's first goal in the clash earlier this month @entity75 is a fighter - wenger 12 - @entity77 ( @entity45 ) 10 - @entity78 ( @entity79 ) 8 - @entity3 ( @entity0 ) 7 - @entity80 ( @entity81 ) 6 - @entity82 ( @entity83 ) ; @entity84 ( @entity85 ) ; @entity86 ( @entity87 ) : @entity88 ( @entity89 ) even being a modest 5ft 7in tall has not stopped him finding the net not only with both feet but in the air			1
after rising between two burly @entity72 defenders to head in against them , in their 3 - 0 win in which he scored twice , @entity8 said : ‘ i did n’t count on him in the air at all			0
' but i know that in the air it is more about desire and he has that			0
he is a winner and finds the resources to get you a goal when it is 0 - 0			0
that ’s what is important			0
' we are in a job where you can always improve			0
he is unbelievably keen and every day wants to practise			0
’ the @entity112 has even compared @entity3 to @entity113 , adding : ' there are similarities with @entity113 a little bit			1
by going at you , by being where you do not expect him to be in the box and by having that huge desire to be at the end of things			0
' given how @entity123 are so desperately struggling with out the @entity124 , @entity8 will not want to become so reliant on one player			0
@entity3 is second in the @entity32 when it comes to shot conversion rate ( stats via @entity33 ) the @entity52 is way out in front when it comes to chances created ( stats via @entity33 )			1

@entity3 has eight goals and two assists this season
the @entity52 *forward* signed from @entity6 for £ 30million
@entity0 would be on the edge of the relegation zone without @entity3
