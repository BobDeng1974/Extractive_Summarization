the family thought they had been burgled when they arrived back at the terraced property in @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 , to find @entity14 had stripped it of curtains , carpets , a fridge freezer , a washing machine and even the family ’s clothes			1
workers broke into the incorrect address to clear it after ' misreading ' the house number			1
spot the difference : the mid-terrace home ( left ) was wrongly gutted by workers that should have gone into the end of terrace home ( right ) it is believed they intended to go into a house just yards away at the opposite end of the street but instead stormed the house while the owners were away			1
upon arriving home , the victims believed they had been burgled and called 999 , only for police to discover the mistake by @entity14			2
the residents dashed to a nearby recycling centre to see if the goods could be retrieved , but they found most of the items had been moved on or destroyed			1
the residents of the property declined to speak this morning , citing a ‘ compensation agreement ’ , however a lady living there confirmed the mix - up			2
a neighbour , who did not wish to be named , said : ' the housing association made a mistake			0
' the woman who lives there was running up and down the street when she got home , screaming her head off			0
' it soon became clear she had n’t been burgled , it was due to all of the palaver with the mix - up of the houses			1
' wrong house : workers broke into the wrong house in @entity11 in @entity12 , @entity13 , which was just yards away from the correct house after ' misreading ' the number @entity14 , who manage around 8,000 former council houses across @entity13 , are currently in the process of refurnishing the house and replacing items where possible			1
workers from the housing association could be seen at the property today			0
it is not clear how workers initially got into the house , but homes can be cleared if social housing providers believe a tenant has died or has left the property with no intention of returning			1
@entity89 confirmed the blunder but refused to give any details , claiming it wanted to protect the victim ’s identity			0
a spokesman for @entity14 said : ' we can confirm that we removed a number of goods from a private home by mistake			2
' we have put the matter right and replaced goods without any formal agreement and to the satisfaction of the resident who has accepted our sincere apologies			0
' housing association : @entity89 confirmed the blunder but refused to give further details spokesman : @entity89 said : ' we can confirm that we removed a number of goods from a private home by mistake ' ' we have put the matter right ' : workers from the housing association were in the road today @entity118 confirmed the force received a call of a reported burglary			1
a spokeswoman said : ' inquiries were made and it was identified that a housing association had removed the items from the house			0
' it was decided no criminal offence had taken place and the matter was not investigated further			0
' bosses at the housing association made headlines earlier this year after suggesting residents should give up @entity136 , cigarettes and bingo to make up for @entity140 welfare cuts .			0
