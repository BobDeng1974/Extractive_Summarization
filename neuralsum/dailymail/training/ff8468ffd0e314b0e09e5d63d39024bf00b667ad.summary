@entity0 called for a police inquiry into the @entity3 scandal last night after finally admitting that there may have been an @entity6 cover - up			1
after two weeks of obfuscation and denial , the @entity7 leader at last conceded the need for a full police inquiry into the 29 - stone paedophile ’s vile sex crimes			1
he called for a probe into allegations of a conspiracy in which senior politicians , police and the security services colluded to cover up the former @entity22 mp ’s reign of abuse over several decades			1
accusing @entity3 of ‘ truly grotesque acts ’ , mr @entity0 called on the police to investigate whether there was a wider paedophile ring involving politicians from all parties , not just his own			1
changing his tune : @entity0 has called for a police inquiry into the @entity3 scandal after finally admitting there may have been an @entity6 cover - up but mr @entity0 still refuses to launch an investigation into what @entity35 politicians knew about @entity3 ’s abuse and whether they could have acted to bring him to justice			1
what the deputy prime minister is desperate to avoid is an investigation that focuses solely on his party			2
however , mr @entity0 would not explain how any police inquiry would operate , saying it was up to the police to decide who should be questioned and which documents should be examined			0
campaign : @entity49 , the current @entity50 mp for @entity22 , welcomed mr @entity0 's change of heart although his call falls short of demands for a full public inquiry into historic child sex abuse cases , it is the first time mr @entity0 has accepted that the @entity6 ’s reaction to the scandal had not been good enough			1
@entity49 , the campaigning @entity50 mp for @entity22 , welcomed the change of heart but said it was a shame mr @entity0 had to be led ‘ kicking and screaming ’ to make it			1
he called on police to question former @entity35 leader @entity63 , who recommended @entity3 for a knighthood in 1988 despite claims that rumours of his abuse were known at the highest levels			1
police believe @entity3 , who died in 2010 , abused dozens of boys at care homes in @entity22 and @entity71 during the 1960s and 1970s			1
despite numerous investigations , he was never charged with any offence			0
three times the @entity76 rejected police files detailing his abuse , claiming the cases would not stand up in court			0
an explosive book by mr @entity49 , serialised in the @entity81 , reveals that @entity3 was protected by local politicians , the police and even the security services			1
he claims other politicians were involved in abuse , and that @entity3 may have been at the heart of a paedophile ring			1
when the allegations first came to light , mr @entity0 rejected calls for further inquiries – saying an internal probe had shown that no one knew anything			2
he was also accused of obfuscation by saying the allegations dated from before the formation of the @entity7 , and that many of them dated from before he was born			2
yesterday , however , speaking in @entity101 at the launch of the @entity7 ’ @entity104 election campaign , he said : ‘ the accusations and allegations surrounding @entity3 are very , very serious			1
‘ they are also part of a set of allegations that there was a wider conspiracy involving politicians from other parties involving a cover - up by the police and security services			2
this was looked into by the police in the past and not pursued			0
‘ a police inquiry is the only way we can get to the bottom of something which spans so many decades , which covered so many different organisations , and touches on so many different political parties and the police			0
‘ that is why i very much hope that , in addition to the inquiries the police are already conducting into children ’s homes where abuse is alleged to have taken place , that they will not hesitate to reopen this so that every aspect can be looked at and people , particularly victims , can feel that justice is finally being done			0
’ mr @entity0 said police should also look at whether other politicians were involved in a paedophile ring			2
but he denied he was evading his party ’s responsibility to investigate the scandal			0
‘ it involves reprehensible criminal acts and collusion , covering up of those criminal acts , ’ he said			2
‘ that is not something that any political party could possibly resolve			0
’ mr @entity49 welcomed mr @entity0 ’s call for an investigation as a ‘ step in the right direction ’			0
he added : ‘ i think it is a shame that @entity0 has taken two weeks to do this			0
he is the deputy prime minister after all ; one of the most powerful people in the country			2
he should have taken the issue of paedophilia and cover - ups much more seriously than he has in the past , and it is unfortunate that he has been dragged kicking and screaming to this position			0
’ last night a @entity7 mp said there must have been people in @entity170 in the 1970s who had heard the rumours of @entity3 ’s abuse but kept quiet			1
@entity174 , mp for @entity175 , said : ‘ they should have done something about it			0
where there are rumours they should be investigated , however important that person is within the organisation			0
