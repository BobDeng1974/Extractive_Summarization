@entity1 ’s chief spin doctor , @entity0 allegedly told @entity3 ’s @entity2 that the @entity5 leader had seen the @entity7 scandal as ' another @entity9 moment ’ my first rule of political scandals is that they do n’t matter unless people are talking about them in the pub. any important scandal needs a moment that turns them from a storm in the @entity22 teacup to a topic of debate in the @entity25			1
with @entity28 ’ expenses , it was sir @entity30 ’ duck pond			0
with phone hacking , it was @entity9 ’s voicemails			1
and with @entity35 , it was n’t the fact that he swore at police officers ; it was that much - disputed word ‘ pleb ’			0
this week , the release of secret files on @entity7 ’s @entity44 banking operations has set off a political firestorm , but as @entity22 pores over the ashes and wonders where the scandal goes next , the real question is what – if anything – will get people talking down at the pub ? it should be the facts that at least 1,000 wealthy @entity57 used @entity7 ’s @entity44 banking arm to evade tax ; that only one has so far faced prosecution ; and that – at the height of the investigation into the case – the boss of @entity7 was made a government minister by @entity68			1
that stinks to high heaven			0
as someone who worked both at @entity73 and at the @entity74 , i am incredulous that ministers were unaware of @entity7 ’s involvement in the @entity44 scandal when @entity78 , the bank ’s former chief executive , was made a minister			1
in theory , @entity73 staff with access to confidential tax data are not supposed to share the details with @entity74 officials and ministers			1
the reality is that – whenever a case is deemed sensitive , either because of the individual or company involved , the scale of the evasion , or in @entity7 ’s case , both – the taxman will find a way of informing the @entity74 , not least to cover their backs if it all goes wrong			1
they will usually do so face - to - face rather than in writing so there is no record of taxpayer confidentiality being breached			0
in 2004 , i was warned by a revenue official that his staff were planning to present a £ 100,000 tax bill to a pop star while he was signing records in @entity107			2
he said : ‘ obviously , i ca n’t tell you who it is ’ , then walked out of my office singing @entity114 ’s @entity113			2
but when the @entity44 case emerged in 2010 , it was n’t just @entity73 ’s job to inform the @entity74 of @entity7 ’s involvement			1
it should have been the @entity74 demanding to know what was going on , who was involved , what revenue was at stake , and what action needed to be taken			0
@entity1 was said to have seen it as an opportunity to stand up to the powerful , just as he did when the hacking story involving murdered schoolgirl @entity9 ( pictured ) broke in december 2012 , @entity128 announced a deal with @entity44 that he called the ‘ largest tax evasion settlement in @entity57 history ’			1
that was no small matter : the £ 5 billion the settlement was forecast to raise allowed the chancellor to claim that government borrowing had fallen not risen in 2012			0
are we expected to believe that he and his officials prepared that deal without ever asking @entity73 what they knew about tax evasion in @entity44 banks ? i am reluctant to believe the @entity74 is lying , and i do not believe they are wholly incompetent , so i am forced to a third uncomfortable theory			1
they were never told because they chose not to ask , and put their fingers in their ears when @entity73 tried to tell them			0
why ? because in government , once you officially know something , you have to publicly do something , or you will one day be accused of a cover - up			0
in this case , @entity78 would need to have been sacked , donations to the @entity158 from tax evaders would need to have been returned , and prosecutions brought against those 1,000 wealthy individuals , rather than settlements agreed with them			1
far better for @entity128 and his ministers to act like the wise monkeys , and hope that @entity7 ’s involvement was never publicly exposed			1
@entity166 is the real scandal , and if @entity1 and his office had done their job , that is what would have been on tonight ’s agenda at the pub. @entity1 ’s task was to expose the facts of the @entity7 case in a way everyone could understand , and then forensically pick apart the government ’s ‘ see no evil , hear no evil ’ defence			1
instead , the @entity5 leader was diverted into a demeaning squabble over the tax affairs of former @entity186 treasurer @entity185 , and then broadened his assault to the entire practice of tax avoidance			2
this week , the release of secret files on @entity7 ’s private banking operations - revealing at least 1,000 wealthy @entity57 used @entity7 ’s @entity44 banking arm to evade tax - has set off a political firestorm not only did that distract attention from the @entity7 case , and allow @entity68 to question @entity5 ’s record on tax avoidance , it has also exposed the @entity5 , its donors , peers and @entity28 , and miliband himself to a frenzied media investigation into their own tax affairs			1
even worse , @entity1 ’s chief spin doctor , @entity0 , then had a conversation with the @entity3 ’s @entity2 , which led @entity2 to write : ‘ the @entity208 ’s aides say that he sees this as another @entity9 moment			2
’ the @entity3 man clarified that the phrase was not a direct quote , but that @entity1 saw this as a moment to stand up to the powerful , just as he did when the hacking story broke			0
that @entity0 did not say the actual words ‘ @entity9 moment ’ is welcome , just as it is welcome that @entity222 ’s picture of @entity224 flags in @entity225 was not accompanied by the words : ‘ get me back to @entity228			2
’ but what matters is the sentiment , not the words			0
as i noted earlier , the @entity9 story provoked a spontaneous outpouring of public outrage which brought the hacking scandal to national attention			0
@entity1 did not make that happen , but he appeared to speak for the country when calling for resignations and an inquiry			0
now all the public can see – based on his spin doctor ’s own analysis – is that @entity1 was not sharing their outrage ; he was exploiting it			2
@entity0 ’s thinking betrays a man who has played the @entity22 chess game too long and thinks only of tactics and gambits			2
as someone who was a liability in my job long before i was forced to quit , i know the signs , and the fact @entity0 could not even hear how appalling his analysis sounded is one			0
as it is , he has ensured that if the punters ’ conversation in the pub does turn to this week ’s scandal , the cynical comparison with their anger over @entity9 will be what is best remembered and most guaranteed to offend			1
@entity1 has not just missed an open goal this week ; he and his foolish spin doctor have crashed a spectacular 100 - yard volley back into @entity5 ’s net .			0

leaked files on @entity7 ’s @entity44 operations has set off a political firestorm
1,000 wealthy @entity57 used it to evade tax but only one faced prosecution
but @entity280 asks what will get people talking down at the pub ?
@entity280 is a former *adviser* to @entity285
