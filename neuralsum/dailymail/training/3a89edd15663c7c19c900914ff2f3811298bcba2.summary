by @entity0 published : 07:37 est , 12 august 2013 updated : 07:40 est , 12 august 2013 a mother who was involved in a horrific car accident at the age of 14 which left her with 50 broken bones has turned her life around to become a spinning instructor			1
@entity7 was in a devastating road traffic accident while in @entity9 with her family , leaving her with around 50 broken bones including three breaks in her neck , and her left leg completely destroyed			1
@entity7 , now 31 , was faced with the decision of being wheelchair bound with a lifeless leg , or getting it amputated and getting a prosthetic			1
determination : @entity7 lost her leg in a horrific road accident when she was 14 but did n't let it ruin her life and has now become a spinning instructor she decided to have an above - knee amputation just before her 16th birthday			1
making the decision was extremely tough			2
but @entity7 was strong and did n't let her disability keep her down			1
she refused to sit inside and mope , as she puts it , and she developed an interest in cars , car racing and , later , fitness			1
she became a fully qualified fitness instructor and has been teaching for 11 years			1
@entity7 , who currently teaches a tough @entity36 spin - style class called , appropriately , @entity37 , said : ' i was inspired to teach because of not only my mixed experiences i ’d faced from people not understanding my disability but also because i wanted to inspire other amputees to get involved in group fitness as i 'd seen the benefits and confidence it had given me			1
inspirational : @entity7 said she did n't want to sit around and mope about her disability so learnt a new skill and now wants to inspire others to do the same passion : after having an above - knee amputation aged 15 , @entity7 became a fully qualified fitness instructor and has been teaching for eleven years with a new - found passion for spinning ' in life , we always want to feel good about an achievement and this is no different for me			1
i have to tailor so many aspects of my life and to have become a @entity36 instructor just like others had was a huge buzz for me			2
' i feel like i ’ve overcome another hurdle and now can give back to others			0
' there are n’t many instructors who have to face the challenges i do			0
to become qualified was so hard			0
' i had to stay so focused to keep practicing that it showed how much i really wanted it			0
it did n’t just fall into my lap. ' one of the classes @entity7 teaches is a fast - paced spin session called @entity74 that burns 675 calories in 45 minutes			1
and @entity7 says that a lot of the class attendees are shocked when they first see that their instructor is missing a leg			1
sometimes those attending the class even mistake her for a nervous novice			2
she said : ' i always wonder how the participants will react to me walking in			0
turned her life around : after breaking around fifty bones in her body , @entity7 was determined to recover and has now developed a talent for spinning ' i have been asked before : " have you ever done this with your leg ? " , before having to explain that i am the instructor and not just a beginner with a false leg			1
' @entity7 , who is married with children , says she always tries to see the positive in life			1
she explained : ' i embrace being an amputee			0
once i had made the decision to have my leg cut off , there was no going back			2
if you do n’t embrace the hand you ’ve been dealt then you will always struggle to enjoy life			0
' i have a lot to be grateful for and i do n’t ever take for granted the ability to walk			0
i love the fact that i can do so much , but know that a lot of the achievements i ’ve made are through sustained effort			0
' keeping as fit and healthy as i can has really helped my recovery			0
moving on : despite setbacks in life , @entity7 embraces all she has ; she is now married , with children and tries to see the positive in life ' i have n’t ever achieved anything through moping about or sitting around moaning - that ’s for sure ! ' @entity7 is keen to raise awareness and wants her success to inspire others with disabilities to get out there			1
she said : ' i would love other instructors to be more aware of the capabilities of people with disabilities			2
' it did n’t happen overnight but over years i was then able to execute the movements as good as able bodied people			2
' never give up if the going gets tough because this is just adaptation and your body will become stronger			0
some encouragement goes a long way			0
' when asked is if she would ever consider training to enter the @entity136 , @entity7 said : ' it 's a tricky one for me , because i know that if i entered the @entity136 i would be accepted as there are hardly any female competitors			2
' i made the choice the steer away from that path because i want what i do to be relatable to everybody at a grassroots level			0
' anybody can come to my classes , whereas not everybody gets the chance to go to the @entity136			0
