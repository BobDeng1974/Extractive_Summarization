the trio left some three weeks ago , @entity11 , a leader of the @entity13 community in the state capital , @entity15 , tells @entity0			1

@entity9 girl : @entity28 teen @entity21 pleaded guilty to terror charges in @entity22 federal court today after her april arrest for trying to flee the country and join @entity6 searching : @entity33 ( pictured on the right , with a friend ) tried out several different religions in college before selecting @entity38 abroad , police fear two young girls who fled @entity41 are inspiring other teenagers to join @entity26 ranks after they successfully fled the country saying they were going to @entity3			1
@entity44 was aged just 16 and her friend @entity45 15 when the two vanished this year from their homes in the @entity41 capital @entity49			0
the case of one of the @entity2 girls , a 19 - year - old , has already been widely reported , after the girl 's family called the @entity55 , but @entity11 said he believes at least two more girls have gone to the @entity58 hotspot			1
' their identity is not known because their families have not contacted the authorities , ' said @entity11			0
' they have gone to @entity3 but as there are no official reports of them we do not know who they are			0
' the shocking new revelation comes as @entity0 can reveal that the @entity55 has subpoenaed the 19 - year - old girl 's family to appear before a @entity72 later this month , as authorities attempt to discover who bought her ticket , gave her money and provided her with a false passport			1
there is no suggestion that the family is under criminal investigation , said one law enforcement source with knowledge of the subpoena			0
' they are looking for evidence on exactly what the family knows , ' said the source			0
included in the subpoena is a demand for cell phone records as the girl called her brother from @entity94 and later , after she crossed the border , from @entity3			2
teen jihadis : @entity97 is @entity44 , 16 , who is thought to have fled to @entity3 to join the @entity26 from @entity41			2
on the right is 15 - year - old @entity45 who went with her @entity41 teens : @entity44 and @entity45 in a photo they posted online			1
police now fear the two are inspiring other girls to flee to @entity3 to take up holy war however , @entity11 said the girl 's family is worried about what may happen at the @entity72 hearing and feels ' betrayed ' by the @entity55 's action as it believed it had done the right thing by contacting authorities in the first place while the families of the two unidentified girls do not have to appear			1
@entity55 's @entity2 spokesman @entity117 told @entity0 he ' is not in a position to comment ' on the subpoena because the case of the missing girl is an ongoing investigation			1
' i can not confirm and will not deny its existence , ' he said			0
the teen , who turns 20 next month , was about to start nursing classes at @entity128 but decided to leave to give aid to wounded fighters			1
@entity11 said he is sure she will not be placed into front line battle but it is possible she would be married off to one of the @entity6 fighters			2
she is the middle of five children brought up by a single @entity13 mother , living off @entity15 's @entity140			1
she had recently started taking classes at @entity143 and @entity144 in the @entity146 suburb of @entity147 , said @entity148 , a former sheriff in @entity15 , who has dedicated himself to helping the @entity151 ' large @entity13 community since being defeated in an election in 2010			1
@entity153 has been at the center of claims that @entity156 , an alleged recruiter for @entity6 , had been talking to youngsters on its site			2
the mosque kicked the @entity162 - born man off campus , but now the @entity146 - @entity164 tv station has raised questions of whether @entity166 is actually an @entity55 mole rather than an @entity6 recruiter			1
possible recruiting ground : @entity153 has been at the center of claims that @entity156 , an alleged recruiter for @entity6 , had been talking to youngsters on its site ' what we do n't know is whether @entity175 is part of the problem or part of the solution right now , ' said @entity11			1
' and who is @entity181 ? where did he come from ? did he recruit these girls ? ' @entity166 sued the @entity55 in federal court in 2009 claiming he was tortured and held for four months in three different countries after being apprehended crossing the @entity13 border into @entity187			2
the young woman who is known to have gone to @entity3 traveled on a ' borrowed ' passport			0
however the passport holder did not report it was missing until the girl had already entered @entity3 , the @entity190 reported			0
in the family 's only comments , a male relative asked in the @entity190 : ' how many more kids have to die before we do something about it ? ' those animals who are taking our children are what we ’re concerned about			2
we love this country more than anything else			0
we do n’t want to see anything bad happen here			0
this is the most dangerous thing happening to this country			0
' @entity6 has rocketed to infamy over the summer due to its savage rampage through @entity19 and @entity3 where it has murdered thousands of civilians and soldiers			2
@entity9 journalists @entity214 and @entity216 were both beheaded in videos that the group distributed to the west			0
despite the violent imagery , @entity148 , the retired sheriff , said recruitment to @entity6 is appealing to young @entity222 because they get the feeling they are in at the start of something new , an @entity38 state , hat they believe can offer them a future they fail to see in @entity9			0
' many @entity13 are struggling as their transition to the @entity9 life has been difficult			0
they have been here a shorter time than most immigrants and their arrival coincided with a downturn in the economy so many have not been able to find work			0
' many also came here without fathers , who had either been killed in the war or did not make the trip , so on occasion the extremist religious leader becomes their father - figure			0
' he said that going to be a nurse in an @entity6 stronghold like @entity251 in northern @entity3 is also attractive because it is portrayed as relatively stable away from the frontline battle and a place where volunteers can start to build the infrastructure of a new city .			2
