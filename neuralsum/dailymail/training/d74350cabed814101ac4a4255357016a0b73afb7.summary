some of @entity1 's most unusual office blocks , including several with a futuristic spaceship - style design , have been given listed status			1
the 14 buildings all date from after the @entity6 , and were listed at @entity7 as part of a drive by @entity10 to recognise a new generation of architecture - much of which was controversial when it was built			1
the organisation praised the way that architects have responded to ' radical changes ' in the way offices work , with a shift towards open - plan space dominated by rows of computers			0
also given listed status is @entity57 - formerly @entity58 - in @entity39 , designed by the architect behind the @entity61 tower			2
the ' @entity26 of @entity27 ' - @entity25 and its roof gardens - have both been listed , with the gardens given grade ii status on the register of parks and gardens			0
@entity33 's @entity32 headquarters in @entity34 , @entity30 , designed by the firm of @entity70 , is also now protected from destruction thanks to its listing			0
innovative : @entity75 in @entity76 , @entity74 was built for @entity77 but is now the headquarters of @entity79 brutalist : the @entity75 office block was built using exposed brick in a style popular in the 1970s unusual : 1 @entity85 in central @entity39 , built by @entity86 , is on the list of buildings protected from significant alteration pavilions : the former @entity91 in @entity92 has been honoured for its architectural importance sleek : @entity95 in @entity41 , whose exterior is on the left and interior is pictured right , has also been listed four of the 14 office blocks are in @entity39 , two in @entity41 , two in @entity45 and the other six distributed around other major cities and suburban areas			1
a number of other buildings were also considered for listing but ultimately rejected , including @entity107 , formerly known as the @entity107 , which is one of the most prominent skyscrapers in the @entity51			0
listed buildings can not be altered or demolished without explicit permission from the local planning authority , which often consults central government before allowing any changes			2
the rules state that buildings are only eligible for listing 30 years after they were built - meaning that all of the newly listed office blocks date from before 1985			1
under - rated ? the @entity119 argues that buildings like the former office of @entity122 and @entity123 in @entity45 need more protection futuristic : @entity58 in @entity126 , central @entity39 , left , and the former @entity127 in @entity128 , right , share aspects of their design controversial : buildings like @entity132 in @entity133 , pictured , are not to everyone 's taste despite their new status @entity137 : @entity132 is constructed from interlocking rectangles which overhang the street below garden : another view of @entity25 in @entity27 , whose garden has been listed as well as the building itself the @entity119 argues that more protection is needed for modern buildings , because they are often given a lower priority than more historic structures despite their architectural importance			1
culture minister @entity151 , who approved @entity10 's recommendation over the listings , said : ' listed buildings are not just about historic houses and ancient monuments , they also serve to protect our recent heritage and preserve the best examples of our fantastic architecture			2
' this group of listings reflect the changing face of our working environment and represent the very best in design and it 's entirely right that they be listed grade ii. ' @entity169 of @entity10 added : ' these offices show how architecture has adapted to recent radical changes in how we work			0
' they show how the open - plan working space for computer - led work came about , and how architects responded to the need for lettable , attractive spaces with ingenuity and a deep understanding of human needs			0
