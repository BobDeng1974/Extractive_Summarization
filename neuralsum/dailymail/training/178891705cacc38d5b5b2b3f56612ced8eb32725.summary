more than 220,000 files on immigrants who should have been removed from @entity2 were found rotting in boxes in back rooms in yet another @entity6 scandal			1
overall , the number of migrants who are suspected of overstaying their visas has now hit a staggering 263,000			1
yet , according to the chief inspector of immigration @entity12 , little or no progress is being made in clearing the backlog			1
the former home secretary publicly lambasted his own department after 450,000 historic asylum cases were found piled up in boxes			1
officials spent years trawling through the cases in a so - called legacy exercise which led to at least 160,000 asylum seekers being granted an effective amnesty to remain			1
in a further 74,500 cases , the applicants could not be traced			0
upon unearthing the debacle , the now @entity25 damned the @entity6 ’s immigration operation as ‘ not fit for purpose ’ with ‘ inadequate leadership and management systems ’			1
since then , the immigration system has undergone a series of shake - ups and re-branding exercises but remains in chaos			1
a private firm paid £ 12.7million by the @entity6 to improve removals has managed to repatriate less than one per cent of immigrants contacted			1
tactics used by @entity55 included sending text messages which , in many cases , were simply ignored			0
the latest @entity12 report – which @entity16 ’s @entity6 has been sitting on for months – examined the department ’s so - called migration refusal pool , or @entity61			1
this contains migrants who , since 2008 , have overstayed their visas			2
despite ministers promising to clear the backlog , the @entity61 still contained 173,562 in the three months to june this year , compared to 174,057 in the same period two years earlier			2
as fast as a case is cleared up , a new one is added			0
however , in a new debacle , mr @entity12 said that he had also been made aware of a further 223,600 records , pre-dating december 2008 , which ministers had not previously disclosed			1
government sources said the files – which date from the @entity75 years , when the immigration system was in chaos – had been found piled up in meeting rooms and cupboards at centres in @entity81 and elsewhere			2
incredibly , some documents were found dumped at the bottom of a disused lift shaft , insiders said			0
@entity12 , the chief inspector of @entity86 and @entity87 , found the @entity6 have lost 174,000 illegal immigrants the @entity89 has only managed to track down 58,000 illegal immigrants who have gone missing ' stooge wife ' : @entity92 with boyfriend @entity93 by @entity94 the ringleader of a sham marriage gang used his own girlfriend as a ' stooge wife ' , marrying her to strangers for £ 8,000			1
@entity93 , 29 , organised a string of lucrative fake ceremonies and ' pressured ' women to take part			0
his girlfriend , @entity92 , 28 , was one of several bogus brides who would marry foreign nationals for £ 8,000 a time so that they could stay in the @entity2			1
@entity93 , along with @entity108 , 66 , paid the women to marry strangers from @entity110 and @entity111 , a court heard			0
both men , along with @entity92 and two other fake brides were jailed on monday after a judge said they had shown ' total disrespect for the institution of marriage and @entity2 immigration laws '			0
many of the files contained duplicate records , but among the pre- 2008 pool are an estimated 89,000 over-stayers who are still here			2
added to the almost 174,000 migrants in post- 2008 pool , it gives a total of 263,000 – which is the equivalent of the population of @entity130			2
while much of the debacle took place under @entity75 , @entity132 efforts to fix the mess have been faltering according to mr @entity12 – who last week revealed how the @entity6 had been granting citizenship to foreign criminals and illegal immigrants			1
the @entity6 signed a contract with outsourcing giant @entity55 to review and , where possible , close the records of migrants in the @entity61			1
but the deal – worth a potential £ 40million – has saved the taxpayer far less than anticipated			0
in around 60,000 cases , migrants could not even be traced			2
the inspection also found there were ‘ significant inaccuracies ’ in @entity55 ’s records – with the number of departures it claimed credit for overstated by more than 1,140 in 2013/14			0
this represents more than a quarter of @entity55 ’s 4,080 ‘ successes ’			0
last night immigration minister @entity156 said : ‘ we inherited an immigration system in complete disarray , which turned a blind eye to hundreds of thousands of people with no right to be here			0
’ @entity163 , chairman of the home affairs select committee , said : ‘ to fail to know the whereabouts and precise numbers of thousands who have no right to stay here is a serious indictment of our immigration system			2
‘ @entity55 ’s contribution has been minimal , but it costs the taxpayer millions			0
the total of the “ disappeared ones ” is now the size of a small @entity176 city			0
’ @entity179 , @entity75 ’s home affairs spokesman , said : ‘ this report reveals yet another border control failure from @entity16			2
’ @entity55 said it performs only part of the removal process			0
a spokesman added : ‘ it is not contracted to handle , nor able to effect change in the end - to - end process			0

*revelation* in report by @entity12 , chief inspector of @entity86
officials discovered files on 223,600 foreign nationals lying in boxes
around 50,000 of the newly - discovered migrants have been accounted for
ministers were already looking for around *175,000* foreign nationals
it means @entity6 does not know whereabouts of *300,000* ' overstayers '
