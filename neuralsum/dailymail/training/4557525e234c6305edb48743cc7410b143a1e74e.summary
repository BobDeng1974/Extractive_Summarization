the drug , which is also used in anaesthesia , can relieve symptoms in more than 60 per cent of people with depression within 24 hours			1
in contrast , most prescription anti-depressants take four to six weeks to prove effective			1
the findings come after the biggest ever study to examine ketamine ’s effect on depression			1
some 73 people with the condition were involved in the @entity18 study , with two thirds given ketamine , and one third midazolam – a short - acting anaesthetic medication			0
the researchers found that 64 per cent of those given ketamine improved within 24 hours			0
in contrast , only 28 per cent of those given midazolam improved			0
the research was carried out at the @entity28 , @entity29 in @entity30 , and the @entity31 in @entity32 , lead researcher , dr @entity33 , said : ‘ through this study , we ’ve now confirmed in an optimised trial design that ketamine does have robust and rapid antidepressant effects			0
’ @entity2 was given to the patients intravenously and in very low doses			1
dr @entity33 explained : ‘ all previous studies of ketamine have compared it to saline , an inert placebo without physical or psychological reactions			0
‘ the problem with this is that ketamine has usual side effects , such as feelings of floating , feelings of altered sense of time , maybe some blurred vision or some other physical or psychological symptoms			0
‘ patients know that they received something active and the raters would know that as well , so the validity of the study may be in doubt with saline studies			0
‘ this is the first trial to compare ketamine to another drug that also has psychoactive properties			1
’ dr @entity33 and his colleagues followed the patients for seven days and found that many of the patients who received ketamine continued to benefit from the treatment after seven days , although there was a decrease in benefits by day seven			1
the drug , which is also used in anaesthesia , can relieve symptoms in more than 60 per cent of people with depression within 24 hours			1
image shows the ketamine molecular model they then studied the subgroup of patients who did well at day seven to see how long they remained depression - free and found that a small group of patients were able to remain depression - free for an additional four weeks			1
dr @entity33 says that there is still much more that needs to be understood before ketamine can be used clinically			0
for example , the best dose to use would have to be established and side effects , such as elevated blood pressure , would have to be taken into account			1
the researchers believe that ketamine reduces depression by influencing the glutamate system – glutamate are neurotransmitters which speed up the transmission of information from one nerve cell to the next			1
severe depression could be more common in men than women , new research suggests			2
it has long been thought that women are 70 per cent more likely to suffer from severe depression than men are			2
however , the new study suggests that if the symptoms of depression in men are properly diagnosed , the condition could be just as common , if not more common , in men than it is in women			2
according to the research , published in the journal @entity119 , this could explain why men are four times more likely to commit suicide than women are			0
the @entity123 reports that when symptoms such as rage , risk - taking and substance abuse are taken into consideration , the number of men diagnosed with depression increases significantly			2
it is thought that many men with depression are currently not diagnosed because their symptoms can be very different to those seen in women with the condition			2
‘ when it comes to depression in men , to some extent we have blinders on , ’ dr @entity137 , a psychiatrist at @entity138 told the @entity123			2
‘ we have not been asking about and taking into account a range of symptoms that may be gender - specific			0
’ common symptoms of depression include feeling down , difficulty sleeping , feeling guilty , feeling worthless and a loss of interest in hobbies			0
however , particularly in men , symptoms can also include anger , aggression and hyperactivity .			0

the benefits from one dose of the drug can last for up to five weeks
