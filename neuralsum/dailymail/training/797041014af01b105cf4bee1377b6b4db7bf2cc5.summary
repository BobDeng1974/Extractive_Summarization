by @entity0 last updated at 4:28 pm on 7th october 2011 a market trader has been banned from selling a ' morale - boosting ' anti-taliban t - shirt by council bosses who fear it will offend people			1
the t - shirts , which feature the words ' @entity7 ' around a target set behind a skull and two guns , have become popular with soldiers on the front line as well as their relatives at home			1
however stall holder @entity16 , who runs a military goods pitch a @entity20 market in @entity21 , has been told to stop selling the product by @entity23			0
controversial : the ' @entity7 ' t - shirt which was withdrawn from a market trader 's stall following a complaint today is the tenth anniversary of the beginning of the war in @entity31			1
the authority acted after it received a single complaint from a member of the public about the t - shirts , which were described as ' politically sensitive and offensive '			1
@entity16 removed the items from his stall immediately , but he has started a debate on social networking site @entity41 to find out if his customers think they are distasteful			1
he said : ' this t - shirt is worn by troops as a morale booster and by their families and supporters back home			1
' i think @entity50 are being somewhat insensitive towards the troops serving out there			0
' everyone has their own point of view on the subject			0
decade of war : today is the 10th anniversary of the beginning of the conflict in @entity31 ' @entity23 told me they had received a complaint and said it was politically sensitive and offensive and i voluntarily withdrew it on wednesday			1
' if people do find it offensive on the @entity41 site i will withdraw it from the website			2
' so far , @entity16 has sold the t - shirts - unchallenged - at a number of events and market stalls in the area , including the @entity75			2
@entity76 , a fellow @entity21 stall holder who runs a greeting cards pitch , believes the product should be allowed back on the market			2
he said : ' i ca n't see the problem , if it was pornographic i would understand			0
i think it is too much political correctness			0
' however other traders have disagreed , with some saying the t - shirt could give the market a bad reputation			1
@entity89 , who runs a musical instrument stall , said : ' it could be interpreted as racist			0
it is a very sensitive issue and you should not make fun out of it			2
' i doubt it could be sold on a market in a more multi-cultural city so why should it be any different in rural @entity21 ? ' a spokesman from @entity23 said : ' we are aware people have differing views , but the council received complaints from local people and responded accordingly			0
mr @entity16 agreed to withdraw the product			0
