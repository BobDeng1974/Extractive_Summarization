a-levels and gcses have got easier over the past decade , an official analysis has confirmed			0
a series of reports by @entity5 , the exam watchdog , has found that science and geography papers are ‘ softer ’ and ‘ less demanding ’			1
teenagers now have more multiple choice questions and papers with less scientific content			1
gcses and a-levels in science and geography are easier than they were ten years ago , the exams regulator @entity5 has said ( posed by models ) the watchdog warns that the dumbing down is leaving pupils ill - prepared for university and means there is less opportunity for good students to shine			2
last week @entity25 , the chief executive of @entity5 , said the value of exams had been undermined by more than a decade of ‘ persistent grade inflation ’ which was ‘ impossible to justify ’			1
four years ago , researchers from @entity30 concluded that a-levels are now two grades easier than they were two decades ago			0
sixth formers who would have got a grade c in the 1980s would now get an @entity35 last night , the @entity36 said the reports ‘ show evidence of a gradual decline in standards ’			1
a spokesman said : ‘ in particular these reports show that in recent years not enough has been demanded of students , and that they are not being asked to demonstrate real depth and breadth of knowledge			2
‘ it is good that @entity5 has already taken action to strengthen the science gcses and we are committed to restoring confidence in all gcses and a-levels as rigorous and valued qualifications			2
’ slide : since 2001 figures show more pupils are getting top grades the watchdog conducted reviews of gcses and a-levels in biology and chemistry between 2003 and 2008 as well as a-level geography between 2001 and 2010 and a-level critical thinking in 2010			2
the findings showed that among gcses , changes to the way the exams were structured had ‘ reduced the demand ’ of the qualifications , while the a-level reviews found that changes to the way papers were assessed had made them easier			1
the a-level geography review found that the removal of coursework from the qualification in 2010 – which was usually a 4,000 - word investigation – had made it ‘ less demanding ’			2
it also revealed that there had been a shift ‘ towards human geography and away from physical geography ’ , fewer subjects were covered and there were fewer chances to assess pupils ’ skills			0
the review added that the content of a-level geography had ‘ softened ’ and that harder topics , such as atmospheric systems , had been removed the a-level chemistry review found exams had become easier between 2003 and 2008			1
the a-level geography review found the removal of coursework from the qualification in 2010 had made it ' less demanding ' ( picture , left , posed by model ) gcse biology was easier because there were more short papers with multiple choice and short answer questions			1
@entity5 added that reviewers were also struck by the ‘ poor quality ’ of some multiple choice questions , which sometimes included ‘ trivial or irrelevant ’ information and even ‘ made - up words ’ which made it easy for anyone with a basic command of the @entity119 language to pass			1
the a-level biology study criticised @entity122 , the @entity123 exam board , for having a high percentage of short structured questions , which reduced the amount of information pupils had to read			0
the @entity129 exam board in @entity130 was over-generous in its marking of some questions and had less demanding coursework , @entity5 added			1
the a-level chemistry review found that the exams had become easier between 2003 and 2008 because the questions were structured differently			0
‘ in 2008 there were more short answer questions , involving simple recall , and fewer questions that required students to formulate multiple - step responses , ’ the report said			1
in a statement , @entity5 said that gcses are due to be revised after the current review of the national curriculum , while a-levels will also be reviewed			0
@entity148 , a @entity149 member of the @entity150 , said : ‘ i doubt there is anyone left who will be surprised to hear that standards were eroded under @entity155			0
‘ many ways were found to make the results tables look better , and many young people given bad advice to take more “ accessible ” subjects and supposed gcse equivalents			0
‘ now we know that even within these traditional subjects papers became easier			0
‘ in the end the people it lets down are the students who worked so hard for those exams , and it is right for young people ’s sake that this government is determined to ensure rigour in exams			0
