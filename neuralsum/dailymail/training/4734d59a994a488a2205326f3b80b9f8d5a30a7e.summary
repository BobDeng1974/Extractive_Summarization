by @entity0 published : 21:25 est , 6 november 2012 updated : 06:18 est , 7 november 2012 @entity1 was this morning finally declared the projected winner of her congressional race with 98 per cent of precincts reporting and the one - time presidential candidate scraping by with a narrow 3,966 - vote lead			1
it was n't until the very final ballots were counted in her close race against businessman @entity10 that @entity1 was announced as the winner , scraping through by a very slim margin			1
while she prevailed in the end , the close nature of her race and the defeat of another half dozen other @entity19 @entity18 may spell the end of the conservative movement as a major political force			1
focusing locally : @entity1 , seen here in her @entity25 headquarters , is in a particularly tight race to hold on to her congressional seat and she raised the most out of all incumbents most notable were the losses of @entity31 's @entity30 and @entity33 ' @entity32			1
the final tally in the race between @entity36 , a leading member of the @entity38 who ruffled feathers by calling a number of @entity42 ' traitorous @entity41 ' , and challenger @entity43 but the @entity44 is thought to have won by between 1,000 and 2,000 votes			1
all told , @entity46 reports that @entity30 spent $ 13million to hold on to his seat - nearly four times as much as @entity43 raised			1
@entity32 , @entity30 's fellow one - term peer from @entity33 , lost to @entity42 war veteran @entity49 as she earned 55 per cent of the vote compared to his 45 per cent			1
both the races in the @entity31 18th and the @entity33 8th were noted for being particularly nasty as questions were raised over respective military records			1
@entity43 ran negative ads about @entity30 's time in both @entity56 and @entity57			2
@entity58 drew the ire of some supporters after he said that he was n't sure if @entity49 , who lost both legs during her time in @entity57 , was a ' true hero '			0
while @entity62 is known for being a @entity42 stronghold , whose @entity65 votes were quickly called for president @entity67			2
but upstate @entity62 has a number of @entity18 congressional districts , including two where @entity19 - endorsed incumbents were ousted by @entity42 challengers after just one term in the @entity73			1
primping : @entity30 was one of the leaders of the @entity38 when he was elected in 2010 but now faces a difficult race against 29 - year - old @entity43 elected to @entity77 in 2010 during the @entity19 so - called ' uprising ' , @entity76 lost to @entity44 @entity79 , the man she beat out from the seat in the first place			1
@entity18 @entity82 in @entity83 was shut out by @entity44 @entity84 , making him the state 's first openly gay man elected to @entity77			0
while freshmen representatives like @entity76 , @entity82 , @entity36 , and @entity58 make for a trend , the most interesting challenge still comes from that of incumbent @entity1			2
her re-election should have been a breeze considering she was a serious contender for the presidency at one point			0
she won the @entity96 straw poll last august in the pivotal swing state of @entity98 , but her campaign eventually ran out of steam in january as she suspended her presidential bid just weeks before saying she would run again for her spot in @entity77			0
war of words : incumbent @entity32 ( left ) questioned whether double - amputee @entity57 veteran @entity49 ( right ) was a ' true hero ' by july , @entity107 reported that she had raised nearly $ 15million for her congressional war chest , and followed that with an additional $ 4.5million in july through september			2
all told , she raised the most out of all of her peers in @entity77			0
she only won in 2010 with 53 per cent of the vote , making it even more critical that every ballot is counted in this election			0
by 5am , @entity1 was officially declared the projected winner , coming in just shy of a 4,000 - vote lead			1
holding on : republicans are expected to retain the @entity73 so @entity118 will remain speaker ‘ when she was running for president , her attention was clearly not on district concerns and i think that perception stuck with some voters and it is a vulnerability that @entity10 is trying to exploit , ’ @entity25 ’s @entity121 professor @entity120 told @entity122			1
another female @entity18 who has come under the spotlight is @entity130 , the @entity131 from @entity132 who rose to prominence in conservative circles after her address at the @entity136			0
her prime convention placement , which analysts speculated was done to show the diversity within the @entity18 , heightened her national recognition but apparently was not enough to take her over the edge			0
@entity130 conceded to @entity44 @entity143 even though he was only up by less than one percentage point at the time			0
following hype over her strong speech , @entity19 groups reportedly sent out emails to supporters saying that @entity130 was being targeted by liberals intent on stopping her from making history as the first black female @entity18 elected to @entity77			2
two @entity19 favorites who faced threats over ethical concerns had a split night			2
both @entity157 from @entity62 and @entity158 from @entity31 are currently subject to federal investigations , but that apparently had little sway over @entity62			0
@entity157 held on to his seat , beating challenger @entity163 even though he is at the center of a campaign finance scandal where he was accused of taking contributions from the aide to a local rabbi in return for helping him get a green card			2
@entity158 is said to be at the center of an @entity174 investigation relating to the alleged funding of a fake campaign of one of his would - be competitors			0
because of the continuing ethical questions , and the fact that he only won by 52 per cent of the vote in 2010 , it comes as little surprise that @entity44 @entity186 claimed victory on tuesday			0
looking at the larger picture , these loses meant little for the @entity18			0
the @entity18 retained its control over the @entity73 just as it was expected to do and @entity118 will remain the speaker			1
what they do change is the role and influence of the @entity19 , particularly in their credibility in regards to their staying power .			0

tough races for half - dozen @entity19 candidates across the country
@entity1 projected winner of her congressional seat beating @entity42 challenger by 3,966 votes
freshmen congressmen @entity30 of @entity31 and @entity32 of @entity33 both lost their close races
republicans will retain majority of the @entity73 so @entity118 continues to be the speaker
