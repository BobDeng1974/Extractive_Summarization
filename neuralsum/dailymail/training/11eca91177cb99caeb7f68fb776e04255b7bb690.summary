prime minister @entity0 has left political talks in @entity2 claiming that no deal between the opposing sides is possible , with @entity6 president @entity5 branding the attempt as ' amateurish and ham fisted '			1
mr @entity0 and his @entity10 counterpart @entity9 held late - night talks with the major @entity2 political leaders in @entity13 which ended at 1.30am			1
the pair returned to the talks at 8am but left within an hour			2
the two prime ministers had been expected to remain at the talks for the rest of the day before returning to @entity20 and @entity21 respectively			0
@entity0 , right , and his @entity10 counterpart @entity9 , left , leaving @entity23 today after the failed talks mr @entity0 , right , and mr @entity9 , left , held late night talks with all the main @entity2 political parties @entity6 president @entity5 attacked the handling of the talks by the @entity30 and @entity10 governments the two governments tried to convince local political leaders to compromise over the issue of welfare reform			1
mr @entity0 offered a £ 1 billion financial package to the devolved government if they could agree on a deal			1
@entity6 's president @entity5 attacked the talks on @entity41 : ' 2 govts exiting after the most amateurish ham fisted episode i have ever been involved in			1
' many of the region ’s politicians are unhappy at the scale of the financial offer made , with some describing it as “ derisory ”			0
leaving @entity52 this morning , mr @entity0 said : ' we have made good progress overnight and today but a deal is not going to be possible today			1
' he said : ‘ i was putting on the table , potentially , if a number of things could be agreed , what amounted to almost £ 1 billion spending power for the executive over the coming years			1
spending power they want to adjust the situation in @entity2 , where the state and the public sector is so big and the private sector needs to grow			0
’ as well as long - standing disputes over flags , parades and the toxic legacy of the past , the five parties in the power - sharing coalition are trying to achieve consensus on budgetary problems facing the devolved institutions , particularly the impasse over the non-implementation of the @entity30 @entity80 ’s welfare reforms in @entity2			2
@entity6 president @entity5 , pictured today , described the talks as ' amateurish and ham fisted ' the structures and governance arrangements at @entity13 are also on the agenda			1
but the most pressing issue is the budgetary situation			0
the @entity2 executive is stalled over an impasse over the implementation of welfare reforms			2
@entity6 and the @entity92 claim that the changes will disproportionally hit the poorest members of their community			0
the @entity96 said it was willing to implement the planned changes			0
chancellor @entity99 offered the @entity100 the chance to set their own corporation tax rates - pending an agreement on welfare reform			2
prime minister @entity0 pledged a £ 1bn package if the main parties could come to an agreement			2
unionist and @entity110 politicians also face difficulties over long - running issues concerning the flying of flags and parades			0
@entity100 has already had to seek a £ 100 million loan from @entity117 to plug a major budgetary gap			0
unless the parties can agree a budget , the @entity2 executive faces bankruptcy			2
ministers in @entity23 have already had to ask for an emergency £ 100 million loan from the @entity125 to balance their books this financial year , and if a deal on welfare reform is not agreed they will face about £ 200 million of @entity80 penalties for non-implementation			1
as it is unlikely the administration would be able to absorb such a financial burden , the future of the @entity61 effectively depends on a resolution to the welfare reform issue			1
mr @entity0 said the situation was better than yesterday but ' intensive work ' needed to be done to ensure the @entity140 's budget was sustainable			1
' i think things are better today than they were yesterday i think a deal is possible			0
it 's possible because i think the parties have done a lot of good work on the issues that need to be settled - the issue of how to manage parades , how to handle the past , the issues of flying flags			0
' the real work that still needs to be done is to make sure that the budget of the @entity140 is sustainable and works , so intensive work needs to be done between the parties on that issue			0
' with £ 1 billion of spending power on the table , mr @entity0 said a ' comprehensive agreement ' was needed rather than ' simply some words about these issues '			1
mr @entity9 said he also believed a deal was possible and the politicians ' will be able to conclude the outstanding areas of disagreement on the matters that we have discussed '			2
the talks will continue today , discussing @entity2 's history , the issue of flags , parades as well as welfare reform			1
@entity6 ’s @entity174 criticised the offer : ‘ whatever you have been told by the @entity30 prime minister @entity0 , there was no credible financial package offered to executive ministers , to allow us to combat the austerity agenda that this @entity30 government has been inflicting on us over the course of the last four - and - a - half years			1
' @entity2 's first minister @entity185 said that the talks would continue despite mr @entity0 's departure			1
@entity2 's first minister @entity185 , centre , told reporters today that his party was ready to continue with the talks despite the departure of @entity30 prime minister @entity0 earlier today speaking to reporters outside @entity13 , the @entity96 leader said : ‘ anybody who thought we could have reasonably concluded negotiations on a series of issues seriously underestimated the task that we had at hand			1
as far as we are concerned , the process continues			0
we have a job of work to do			0
the absence of the prime minister does not bring that work to an end			0
there is a responsibility placed on the parties in @entity2 by the electorate to get the job done and it is the view of this party that there is still work to be completed			2
‘ as far as the core issue of the financial issues around @entity13 are concerned , i do n’t believe that we sufficiently challenged the prime minister in relation to what his bottom line was on financial issues , and we did n’t do that because we had not ourselves been able to complete agreement on other aspects of the financial issues , namely the matter of welfare reform			1
‘ i think the prime minister would have had more give in him if he had seen that that issue was going to be resolved			0
i am still unaware what the final position is in relation to @entity6 as far as welfare reform is concerned			1
' mr @entity185 said his party welcomed some of the proposals concerning parades and dealing with @entity2 's past			2
he said he was prepared to continue with the talks : ‘ i want to go back down again			0
i want to ensure that we have done everything possible to reach agreement on those issues			0
but it is essential in the climate that we are presently in , that we do not squander money , and that means we have a very tight fiscal position to develop , that means we have to resolve the internal financial issues as far as the executive is concerned			0
' he added : ' we want to continue to see if we can close a deal with the other parties , and i do n’t in anyway view this as being the end of the process simply because the prime minister has left to carry out other duties that he has to perform			2
' a spokeswoman for the prime minister said @entity2 secretary @entity263 , pictured , had spent more than 85 hours with the political parties in advance of the current failed negotiations a @entity268 spokeswoman dismissed mr @entity5 ' criticism claiming that @entity2 secretary @entity263 had been extensively involved in the talks process			1
she said : ' i think altogether , before they met yesterday , that was 85 hours sat round the table trying to resolve these issues			0
' the @entity275 went yesterday and himself spent 10 hours yesterday and a couple of hours this morning trying to resolve the issues			0
' the government is absolutely committed , as the @entity275 said yesterday morning , to taking this opportunity to move forward and make progress , but it is down to the political parties in @entity2 to find resolution on issues like welfare reform and so - called legacy issues			1
' the offer on the table is £ 1 billion of financial spending power			1
that would enable the @entity140 and authorities to address some of the difficult reforms that they need to make			0
that is there for the taking by the political parties in @entity2 if they work to resolve the issues			2
' there is a heads of agreement document on the table for discussion			0
what we need to see is progress on those issues which need to be resolved by the political parties			0
' the spokeswoman said despite mr @entity0 's departure from the talks , the financial offer remained			1
she added : ' the point about the £ 1 billion that is on the table is that it will help to address the situation in @entity2 , where they need to reform the state and public sector and invest in the private sector and help drive the economy and create jobs			1
those are all things that matter to people in @entity2			0

@entity0 left @entity2 after offering £ 1 billion financial deal
local parties did not accept the offer because they could not agree terms
mr @entity0 met his @entity10 counterpart @entity9 during the *crunch* talks
@entity6 and @entity96 could not agree welfare reform
@entity5 branded the failed talks as ' amateurish and ham fisted '
