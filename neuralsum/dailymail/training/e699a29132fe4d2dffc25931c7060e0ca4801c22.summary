' we ’ve only had one since the middle of december			2
the service has been an utter disgrace since @entity44 , ' said farmer @entity2 , aged 50 , a neighbour of the @entity3 's estate			0
' we ’re in an area of outstanding natural beauty yet the council seems happy to let it look like a rubbish dump for weeks			0
' i understand the health and safety aspect and i would n’t want any binmen to be injured , but what about our health and safety ? ' the rats and foxes have had a go at the sacks and the litter is spreading			1
' the council should have put on extra rounds as soon as it was safe , but i guess they were n’t prepared to pay for the overtime			0
