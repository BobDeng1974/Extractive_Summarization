by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 one of the most peculiar sights of this @entity3 came last week in @entity4			1
as the roads of the north - east coastal city ran two feet deep in water after overnight rain , journalists on a media bus battling through the torrents to reach the @entity8 took photographs and shot video of the chaos			0
it was only after a few moments that it became clear that some of the townsfolk – clinging to lamp posts and traffic islands to keep dry – were taking photos right back			0
there are not many local black faces in the stadia on match day			2
@entity3 2014 has out priced vast swathes of its host nation but we should n't be surprised and it is not alone			1
this is the way in modern sport			0
go on to a council estate in @entity44 and ask people how many of them have tickets for the next @entity47 and you will get my point			0
it was the same in @entity52 in 2010 and will be the same in @entity53 in 2018			0
the @entity3 has long since been an event for tourists and televisions			1
if you own a hotel or restaurant in @entity29 then you will have won over the last three weeks			1
if you live in one of the scruffy narrow streets that branch off the new four lane highway that runs up to the @entity62 in @entity63 then forget it			0
this @entity3 – like all the others – has been nothing more than a procession passing by your window			1
eye - catching : there has been 154 goals scored at the @entity3 so far as a model for social equality , then , this @entity3 has achieved little			1
as a sporting event , however , it has passed its test comfortably and – thanks to the beauty of the football – spectacularly			0
this , remember , was supposed to be the @entity3 that would n't work			1
it was to be the tournament where stadia were n't ready , where the infrastructure would n't cope and where visiting football fans would lose their wallets and mobile ' phones			2
they said all this before @entity52 , of course , and , just as it did n't happen then , it has n't happened here			0
there is a firmly held belief here in @entity29 that things are better when left to the last minute			2
it 's reflected in the haphazard nature of the service industry			0
if you want your bar meal by full - time , then you are really better off ordering it before kick - off			2
certainly , that has been reflected in the way that the stadia , airports and hotels dragged themselves in to shape just in time			1
those who visited @entity29 in april returned with horror stories of unfinished airport terminals , half - completed roads and stadia without roofs on			1
but while it has n't been perfect , it has certainly worked			0
success : @entity115 has been kept in the background by events on the pitch while you would n't wish to get to the airport in @entity122 in a hurry – the shiny new road from the terminal gives way to cobbles and potholes after about a mile – or reach the stadium in @entity4 in time for a pre-match sandwich , these have been the exceptions			0
the airports here would certainly shame @entity134 in @entity135 and while some hotels have n't been places in which you wish to linger for post-dinner drink it must be remembered that @entity29 remains , in essence , an extremely poor country			1
those who have followed their teams across this vast landscape will have returned home exhausted , penniless and with more air miles than @entity148			0
@entity29 does n't do trains			2
that , however , is @entity151 's issue and , happily , it is one they seem set to address in time for @entity53 2018 where we will return to the old system of basing each group in one city			1
that way , supporters wo n't get to see as much of @entity53 but will also mean a @entity3 holiday wo n't require a second mortgage			2
@entity151 , of course , will make a fortune out of this tournament			1
ticket prices are far too high and some @entity151 - recommended hotels profit from the uncertainty of the knockout stages by charging last - minute visitors rates to make the eyes water			1
more than £ 800 for two nights at the @entity173 , anyone ? it is indicative , though , of a successful tournament that @entity151 president @entity115 has hardly been mentioned since this one started			1
when the football is good , and the @entity3 ticks along without undue drama , all the rest just becomes a sideshow			2
my @entity3 so far totals twelve matches , 16 flights and – most importantly – 36 goals			2
that 's a spectacular return in keeping with the overall figure of 154 goals so far			0
the atmosphere in the stadia has far outstripped that of @entity52 , thanks largely to vastly increased numbers of visiting fans from competing nations			0
and the really good news ? there are still eight games to go .			0

@entity3 2014 has out priced vast swathes of its host nation
stadia , airports and hotels dragged themselves in to shape just in time
@entity151 will make a fortune out of the tournament in @entity29
