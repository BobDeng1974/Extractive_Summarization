the original owner has not been located lost in time : a membership card for the leisure centre belonging to a ' mr @entity23 ' which expired in march 1978 that was found in the wallet discovered : the out of date member card says on the back of it ' if found , returned ( sic ) to reception ' the wallet appears to have been lost in the wall in early 1978			1
they also found a payment plan for a new television , with a final installment of £ 1 still due			0
despite an extensive search the builders have not been able to trace the original owner			0

despite the builders ' best efforts , they have been unable to trace the owner of the wallet mr @entity6 said : ' they are altering the roof up there and we were just up doing some wiring			2
' a brick was taken out to thread some wire through and then we saw the wallet stuffed in there			0
' i was surprised to find it in the wall to be honest , i do n't know why somebody would put it down there			0
' there was no money in it for anything , just a gym membership and a driving licence that expired before i was even born			0
' there was a payment plan in there as well for a tv and i think the last payment was just a quid			0
that was probably a lot of money in those days though			0
' mr @entity5 said : ' we hope that the owner can be reunited with their wallet as it contains personal belongings			2
' a spokesman for @entity118 , which runs the leisure centre , said that they were unable to find mr @entity15 on their system			1
