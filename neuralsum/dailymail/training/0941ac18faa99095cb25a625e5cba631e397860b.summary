it has been a long wait for @entity1			1
more than six months since his last goal at @entity6 , but when it came , it was perfectly timed			0
in slid @entity1 to divert yet another low grubber from @entity8 past @entity10 goalkeeper @entity9 and so fire @entity11 into a date with @entity13 in the fourth round of the @entity15			1
perhaps more importantly , the @entity17 striker saved @entity11 when they seemed destined for 30 minutes of extra-time , the possibility of penalties and a further waste of nervous energy , just three days before their trip to @entity24			0
@entity1 wheeled off in celebration after putting his side in the lead for the first time during the game @entity30 finished off the scoring by grabbing @entity11 's third goal against @entity34 's side in the 90th minute @entity35 came off the substitutes ' bench to score an all - important equaliser for his side @entity10 starlet @entity40 opened the scoring at @entity6 in the 61st minute @entity40 was mobbed by his @entity10 team - mate @entity42 after scoring his first competitive goal in @entity45 football spurs 4231 : @entity46 ; @entity47 6 , @entity48 6 , @entity49 6 , @entity50 6 ; @entity51 5.5 ( @entity35 64 , 7 ) , @entity52 6 ; @entity53 7.5 , @entity54 6.5 ( @entity30 64 , 7 ) , @entity55 6 ; @entity1 6 ( @entity56 84 )			1

@entity83 : @entity84 6 @entity85 : 31,912 only eight minutes remained when @entity1 pounced			1
what a welcome relief it was for @entity64 , who has seen his team struggle through four games without a win and watched them go behind on wednesday night to a goal from @entity10 teenager @entity40 on his debut			1
the upset looked very much on , at this point			0
@entity10 had played with great intensity and were worth their lead			1
the travelling supporters , many wearing green sweatshirts in tribute to @entity100 who died 10 years ago , sang ‘ @entity102 is back ’			0
manager @entity34 swung his fist through the air , but @entity64 reacted and finally managed to inject some urgency into his side with an influential double change			1
on came @entity35 to score his first ever @entity11 goal to level the tie and @entity30 , who grabbed his team ’s third in stoppage time			1
in between was @entity1 ’s first goal at home since early march			1
three goals in 18 minutes had punctured @entity10 ’s fun but the green shoots of progress on the field are more important than the green jumpers of tribute in the away end			2
‘ it was a great performance and one the club should be proud of , ’ said @entity34			0
‘ it does n’t sit comfortably with me when we get beaten			0
i am disappointed we lost , but it was against a very good side who cost multi-millions			0
it shows @entity10 is going in the right direction			2
we ’re making baby steps and we have to continue pushing the club in that direction			0
’ it ’s true @entity34 has them upwardly mobile : top of the @entity140 and full of confidence as they tackled opponents from the @entity143			0
@entity64 changed all 11 of those who started against @entity145 on sunday but @entity10 also made it clear they have other priorities , with nine changes of their own			1
top scorer @entity149 did not even travel to @entity150			0
amid the blur , there was and home debuts for @entity51 and @entity48 and a debut for goalkeeper @entity155 , who was beaten by @entity72 in the first half but saved by his woodwork			0
@entity40 places the ball past @entity11 goalkeeper @entity46 to put his side in the lead against the north @entity150 outfit @entity35 , pictured with @entity30 , blows a kiss while celebrating his goal in the third round of the @entity15 @entity35 leaps in the air after scoring at @entity6 to put his side back on level terms 11 - @entity167 , @entity168 , @entity11 and @entity145 9 - @entity13 , @entity169 , @entity10 6 - @entity170 5 - @entity171 , @entity172 4 - @entity173 3 - @entity174 it was a fabulous dribble by @entity72 , who slipped past @entity48 and unleashed a fierce left - footer , which curled past @entity46 ’s dive , crashed into the bar and back into the goalmouth			1
@entity51 and @entity48 were among those who seemed caught out by @entity10 ’s desire and intensity			2
in the first half , all they had by way of attacking intent was an ambitious appeal for a penalty from @entity54 , after the slightest of shirt - tugs by @entity191 , and long - range punts from @entity53 and @entity48			0
@entity54 went close after the break but @entity10 went ahead in the 61st minute			2
@entity74 was given time to work the ball across goal from the left , @entity73 flicked it at the near post and @entity40 arrived totally unmarked to convert from eight yards out			1
@entity64 sent on his substitutes and @entity35 soon equalised with a brilliant swerving strike from 25 yards , although goalkeeper @entity65 might think he could have done more to keep it out			1
‘ i ’ve been waiting for that for a long time , ’ said @entity35			2
‘ i ’ve always been confident in ability			0
i ’ve had to wait a lot longer than others but i thought i made a difference			0
@entity8 rattled the bar with a free - kick , before his effort was turned in by @entity1 to lift the mood			2
@entity30 made it three , low from an angle after a pass from @entity56			2
‘ i was calm , because we needed to be calm , after this disaster , ’ smiled @entity64			2
‘ we always believed we could come back into the game			0
i am happy for the players			0
this is the mentality we need to have			0
