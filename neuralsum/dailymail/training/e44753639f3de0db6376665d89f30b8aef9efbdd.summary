now , just as she prepares for her family @entity14 at @entity9 , @entity1 has received some welcome news			1
@entity1 , who asked scientists from the @entity17 to investigate the canine illness , had warned dog walkers to be vigilant after her land became the worst hit area in the country			1
welcome news : the @entity1 had taken a keen interest in the mystery bug which had struck down the dogs her own dogs are equally at risk , including her corgis and the labradors that pick up pheasants on her @entity33 shoot			1
the trust believes that the outbreak of so - called @entity36 , which affected 49 dogs exercised in woodland at @entity9 this autumn , appears to be over			1
no new cases have been reported for more than a month , so the @entity1 can relax , knowing that royal shooting parties on the estate are no longer at risk			1
the trust also believes it has discovered the cause , after a botanist from the @entity46 was able to rule out various theories			1
outbreak : the @entity36 had also affected dog walkers in @entity50 ( pictured ) there was no sign , i gather , that any plant or fungus was the cause following soil tests which proved negative			1
instead , the trust now thinks the bug is linked to bites from an infestation of harvest mites			1
it says that there have been 95 cases this year in five areas , including @entity67 and @entity69 forests , but @entity9 was worst affected			1
two dogs walked on the royal estate this year have died , while six died last year			1
however , survival rates improved after the @entity1 ordered estate managers to put up signs warning dog owners to watch for symptoms			1
@entity77 has refused to say if the @entity1 has stopped walking her dogs on the estate because of the outbreak			1
a spokeswoman says : ‘ the @entity9 estate is taking the reports of sick dogs very seriously			1

@entity113 bash : @entity114 joined ber future husband on his stag do coming from such an unconventional family , it was perhaps not surprising that @entity114 broke with tradition to celebrate her hen night			1
for rather than being parted from fiancé @entity123 , he came along too for his stag night			1
the daughter of @entity126 tycoon sir @entity114 flew with shipbroker @entity123 to @entity128 at the weekend for a lavish party at her father ’s luxury ski lodge in upmarket @entity113 — along with 26 friends			2
all the girls wore matching t - shirts — but , fortunately for @entity114 , she was spared the usual embarrassment of a hen do when the suitcase containing her party kit was lost			2
‘ it was such a pity @entity114 ’s hen bag did n’t turn up , ’ i am told			2
‘ there were a few surprises in there			2
’ the group boarded a coach at @entity148 airport and were whisked to sir @entity0 ’s nine - bedroom chalet , which rents out at £ 99,800 a week at the height of the skiing season			2
the retreat has 13 full - time staff , including a @entity155 - trained chef			2

@entity171 , who helped with the script , was persuaded on - set by @entity166 to do a sitcom based in a department store			2
the rest is history as @entity166 and @entity171 ’s comedy classic @entity177 is still shown in more than 50 countries			2
on sunday , @entity166 and @entity165 will be reunited on stage at the @entity168 for a charity production of captain @entity182 , the poetry @entity166 set to music in 1977			0

‘ it felt like we were married for ten minutes , but it was for a year , ’ he says			0
‘ @entity165 wrote that maybe we should n’t have got married , and just had an affair instead			0
‘ but i do n’t regret it for a second and we have remained great friends			0
’ and @entity166 is clearly still on good terms with @entity195 , to whom he was engaged for three years : she is travelling from her home in @entity197 for the show			0
tribute : @entity200 , daughter of @entity201 , is developing a television tribute to her late father more than two years after the death of maverick celebrity chef @entity201 , his daughter @entity204 , 27 , is developing a television tribute to her late father			0
hard - living @entity201 died on the same night a less - than - flattering @entity208 documentary was screened about him — a film that upset his family and friends			0

‘ she ’s very much her father ’s daughter , ’ says @entity212			0
‘ she ’s like a little @entity201 , but only with his nice side ! ‘ i ’ve long thought we needed a programme that actually celebrates @entity201 ’s career and @entity204 is the perfect person to do it			0
when i approached her , she thought it was a great idea			0
’ he adds : ‘ @entity204 is a trained architect , not a cook			0
but she will be visiting the places her father went to during his career , re-telling his stories and adventures			0
’ architectural historian @entity236 is furious with architect @entity237 , who used an @entity239 lecture to attack @entity241 airport as unviable ( @entity237 wants it sold off and turned into housing )			0
of course , it just so happens that @entity237 , 75 , is promoting his own proposals for a new four - runway airport in the @entity247 which would earn his company several millions			0
professor @entity236 is unimpressed : ‘ am i alone in getting rather tired of that distinguished tax exile @entity237 pontificating from his @entity128 eyrie on how @entity251 should be re-planned — always with megalomaniac schemes requiring the benevolent intervention of some large architectural practice such as his own ? ’ @entity258 what has @entity256 presenter @entity255 got against biographer @entity259 ? yesterday , @entity260 used her newspaper column to take aim at the author , who has a new royal book out , after @entity266 ’s admission that she was possibly mistaken to have once written that prince @entity267 had been unfaithful			0
‘ no indication of an apology to the husband of the @entity271 for suggesting he broke the seventh commandment , ’ she thundered			0
@entity266 insists she and @entity260 have no history of hostility			0
