@entity0 and @entity1 is a fierce rivalry befitting of saturday evening ’s @entity3			1
it divides families , villages and , this year in particular , the staff room of @entity9 @entity8 in @entity10			0
just 200 metres over the border into @entity0 from @entity13 , its pupils come from both towns			1
on weeks like these , the split between supporters of the rugby league teams is accentuated and feelings at the school , known fondly as @entity21 , are heightened by the presence of two of their former number on opposing sides			1
@entity0 ’s brilliant young winger @entity29 and @entity1 ’ robust forward @entity27 , both just 19 , have earned their starting places in the biggest game of the year			1
it is just three years since they were classmates turning out in the same school team			2
@entity29 surges through the @entity36 defence as @entity0 close in on another @entity3 appearance @entity27 ( c ) of @entity13 fights off @entity39 's @entity38 during a @entity41 match @entity43 @entity42 is a born - and - bred @entity44			1
‘ the rivalry is incredibly fierce , it ’s all - on even from school level , ’ he said			2
‘ it ’s in your blood , you get it knocked into you that whatever happens the rest of the year does n’t matter as long as you beat @entity13			2
my best scenario will be for @entity29 and @entity27 to both play really well and @entity29 to score in the corner with 10 seconds to go			1
’ incredibly , the last time @entity0 and @entity1 met in the season - ending showpiece in 2010 , @entity56 again had a former pupil on each side with @entity60 playing for @entity0 and @entity61 for @entity1			1
@entity62 , head of rugby , proudly highlights the school ’s wall of fame			0
pictures of @entity29 , @entity27 , @entity60 and @entity61 are displayed alongside recently retired @entity69 star @entity68 and @entity71 ’s @entity70			1
@entity72 , a former @entity73 tennis player who once faced @entity74 in the first round of @entity76 has her spot			0
but in these parts nothing gets blood pumping like rugby league			0
‘ it ’s a 60 - 40 split in favour of @entity0 , ’ @entity62 informs me with a wry smile			2
‘ there ’ll be plenty of friendly jibes and staff - room bragging rights are at stake			0
’ @entity29 ( c ) has been tipped for great things after scoring the winning try for @entity0 in the semi-final @entity0 teammates pile on top of @entity29 as they seek to retain their title in the @entity3 @entity62 will take his seat in the executive box at @entity98 as a guest of the @entity100 , in acknowledgment of his service to school rugby			1
‘ they always really stood out but for different reasons , ’ he added , ‘ @entity27 was quieter but always a big , strong lad			2
@entity29 has always been very quick but he ’s grown four inches and put on five stone since joining @entity0			1
’ @entity108 , a hall of famer turned pundit , identified @entity29 and @entity27 as players who would break through this season			1
@entity29 has made an instant impact with his speed and clarity of thinking — notably scoring the winning try in last week ’s semi-final victory over @entity36			1
@entity27 , meanwhile , has impressed in an injury - hit side			1
@entity27 and @entity29 ( r ) were former teammates at the @entity9 @entity8 it was @entity29 ’s dedication that most impressed pe teacher @entity123			1
‘ we were playing our big rivals @entity124 ’s and @entity29 was really sick and off school			2
but i called his mum ( @entity130 ) and said , “ we really need him , ” so she brought him down			0
he was white as a sheet but he played well , we won , then he went back to his sick bed , poor lad			0
but that ’s the mark of the man			0
’ @entity123 , who has been goalkeeping coach at @entity141 ’s academy for nine years , considered putting @entity29 in goal			2
‘ he was an all - round athlete , a runner and a footballer			0
he was over six foot , had great wingspan and handling skills , so could have been a goalkeeper			0
he could have been earning millions in the @entity148 and he gets peanuts in comparison			0
but he had so much passion for rugby league			0
’ @entity61 ( @entity153 ) and @entity154 also went to the same school as @entity29 and @entity27 and played on opposing sides of the 2010 grand final five miles down the road at amateur club @entity159 , where @entity29 played from seven to 16 , when he then joined @entity0 , he was often subject to mistaken identity			1
‘ a lot of people asked if he was another @entity170 brother , ’ said coach @entity162 , referring to the four brothers from @entity165 who moved to @entity166 to ply their trade			0
‘ he was so talented , he ’d score five tries a game and was hugely popular			0
’ he might not be a relative but @entity29 could soon be following his namesakes down under			0
several @entity175 teams have shown interest in signing him and he could make the move as soon as next season .			0
