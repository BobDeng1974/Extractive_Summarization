by @entity0 published : 14:16 est , 27 february 2014 @entity2 : 17:07 est , 27 february 2014 @entity3 today added stunning footage of the @entity5 and its @entity7 inhabitants to @entity9 view - and also revealed staff had had a close encounter when capturing the images			1
aware of the animal 's ferocity , @entity3 wisely decided to mount its cameras on top of a ' @entity18 ice buggy ' rather than its traditional backpack - but this did n't stop one animal taking a closer look			1
the images , to celebrate @entity23 , were captured in @entity24			1
scroll down to explore the area on @entity18 too close for comfort : @entity3 's @entity18 buggy gets a little too close to comfort as it tries to photograph polar bears in the @entity5 up close and personal : @entity3 staff captured this image of a bear trying to scale their vehicle to get a closer look at the camera mounted on its roof the @entity40 camera took more than a year to develop			1
it weighs 40lb and includes a multi-lens 15 - megapixel camera , an on - board hard drive , and enough battery to run for an entire day			2
cameras are positioned to give a 360 - degree view so every possible angle is captured and photos are automatically captured every 2.5 seconds			0
the trekker can be fitted inside a backpack meaning it can be worn by @entity3 photographer - or mounted on vehicles to avoid bear attacks			2
@entity3 worked with @entity55 , executive director of @entity56 to capture the images , converting one of the organisation 's research vehicles into a roving 360 degree camera			1
she revealed a buggy was the only option to capture the animals			2
' in @entity67 poetry , the polar bear is known as @entity68 , the ever - wandering one , ' she said			0
' some of the most majestic and elusive creatures in the world , polar bears travel hundreds of miles every year , wandering the tundra and @entity5 sea ice in search of food and mates			1
' today , with the help of @entity18 , we ’re celebrating @entity23 by sharing an intimate look at polar bears in their natural habitat			1
' the @entity40 , usually carried on a backpack was mounted on a @entity83 , with the help of outfitters @entity86			2
' this allowed us to travel across this fragile landscape without interfering with the polar bears or other native species , ' said @entity91			0
' through october and november we collected @entity18 imagery from the shores of @entity94 as the polar bears waited for the sea ice to freeze over			2
' @entity3 's close encounter : staff were stunned when a bear tried to climb onto their trck to get a closer look at the camera mounted on top of it ' we ’ve joined forces with @entity106 to collect @entity18 imagery from a remote corner of @entity109 ’s tundra : @entity24 , @entity110 , home to one of the largest polar bear populations on the planet			1
' @entity56 has been working in this region for more than 20 years , and claims to have witnessed firsthand the profound impact of warmer temperatures and melting sea ice on the polar bear ’s environment			2
it hopes that regular visits from the @entity3 team will help it spot changes			0
the bear then moves to the back of the truck - causing staff to make a hasty exit inside ' understanding global warming , and its impact on polar bear populations , requires both global and regional benchmarks			0
' bringing @entity18 to @entity109 's tundra establishes a baseline record of imagery associated with specific geospatial data — information that ’s critical if we ’re to understand and communicate the impact of climate change on their sensitive ecosystem			1
' as we work to safeguard their habitat , @entity56 can add @entity18 imagery to the essential tools we use to assess and respond to the biggest threat facing polar bears today			0
' explore the area on @entity3 's @entity150 the trekker is usually mounted on a backpack the organisation has also been working with @entity3 to create a live ' bear tracker ' ' we also use the @entity106 @entity156 to support our @entity157 , which illustrates the frozen odyssey these bears embark on every year			0
' as winter approaches and the sea ice freezes over , polar bears head out onto @entity94 to hunt for seals			0
' @entity157 uses of satellite monitors and an interactive @entity106 to display their migration for a global audience			0
' the project , which can be seen below , lets people track the animals in real time as they move			0
the project is the latest from @entity3 in the area , which has already visited the @entity5 communities of @entity174 and @entity175			0
in the town of @entity24 , the @entity106 team conducted a community @entity178 , which let participants use @entity181 to edit and add to the @entity106			0
ready for his closeup - a @entity7 approaches the @entity3 buggy @entity3 was able top capture stunning pictures of the bear as it approached their buggy from the @entity191 , which includes the local school , rink and movie theatre , to the bear holding facility used to keep polar bears who have wandered into town until their release can be planned , the citizens of the @entity24 were able tosure @entity106 reflects the community that they know			1
the team also captured some stunning images of the @entity206 the buggy used by @entity3 - which the bears seemed to like a little too much			1

@entity7 tried to climb the side to get a closer look
