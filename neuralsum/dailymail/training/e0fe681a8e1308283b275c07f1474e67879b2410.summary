retiring @entity1 captain @entity0 had a hard time stepping into the batter 's box in the bottom of the ninth inning			1
overwhelmed by the outpouring of love from the fans over the past two weeks and all the final moments at @entity11 in a 20 - season career , the always cool @entity0 was about to break down			1
' i almost started crying driving here today , ' @entity0 said after @entity15 's 6 - 5 win over @entity16			1
' i 've done a pretty good job of controlling my emotions throughout the course of my career			0
... today i was n't able to do it			0
' @entity0 approaches the deck for the first inning against @entity16 in his final game at the yankee stadium what he was able to do was give @entity15 one more amazing moment in a career full of them , driving in the winning run in the ninth with - what else ? - an opposite - field single to right field			1
@entity0 leaped high with both arms raised after touching first base , and was embraced by his teammates			1
the 14 - time all - star then lingered on the field , seemingly not wanting to give up the only job he ever hoped to have - shortstop for the @entity1			1
' sort of an out - of - body experience , ' @entity0 said			1
@entity0 's @entity44 teammates - @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity47 - from five @entity49 championship teams joined their @entity51 manager @entity50 and @entity52 and @entity53 on the field			1
@entity0 's family also came out of the crowd at the urging of manager @entity58			1

before he greeted his friends and family , @entity0 took a stroll out to the spot between second and third base , waving to the crowd			2
in an image seen before nearly every one of his 1,391 games at @entity11 , @entity0 faced the outfield and crouched down for a moment of reflection			2
' basically , i just say thank you because this is all i ever wanted to do , ' @entity0 said of his ritual			2
but he was n't done			0
the 40 - year - old captain took one more walk to shortstop , this time covering his face with a towel for a moment or two as he took one last look around and acknowledged the crowd			0
the @entity1 number two looked on as he was overcome with emotion during the national anthem ' i want to take something special from @entity11 , and the view from shortstop here tonight is what i want to take home from it , ' @entity0 said			1
the entire @entity16 team watched the scene from the dugout			2
' our guys , everybody has a lot of respect for @entity0 and what his career has been about , ' @entity16 manager @entity101 said			1
' we wish him well			0

@entity0 admitted after wednesday 's game the past couple of weeks were beginning to weigh on him and it showed			1
he appeared a bit stunned by the 100 media members awaiting him at his locker and took several deep breaths when he settled in at shortstop before the first pitch			0
' to be honest with you , i do n't know how i played this game , ' @entity0 said			2
' i went up my first at - bat , i forgot my elbow guard			0
i was throwing balls away			0
i was giving signs to ( @entity134 ) @entity133 at second base and there 's no one on base , so i was all messed up			0
