@entity0 launched another attack on referees on thursday night after @entity3 were beaten 5 - 3 at @entity4			1
the @entity3 manager , who claimed @entity6 should be ‘ ashamed ’ after failing to awarded a penalty in the 1 - 1 draw at @entity9 , told @entity10 he was ‘ too slow ’			1
@entity3 ’s poor @entity12 run means they are now level on points with defending champions @entity14 after they beat @entity15 3 - 2			1
@entity0 ’s side took the lead at @entity31 through @entity32 and the @entity3 chief claims his side should have been given a penalty when @entity36 appeared to handle			1
he said : ‘ i can go in another direction and say what we all know , which is , with the result 1 - 0 , one clear action could make it 2 - 0			2
@entity0 launched into a tirade at fourth official @entity45 after the incident involving @entity3 's @entity17 @entity3 boss @entity0 directed a furious tirade towards fourth official @entity45 in the second - half ‘ normally , at 2 - 0 , the result would be completely different and the history of the game would be different			1
‘ you are talking about handball			0
why do you want me to speak ? you all know			0
‘ i do n't think we need clarification when there are no doubts			0
when you have doubts , when the situation is not clear , i think the discussion comes good			0
this is the moment that angered @entity0 , when @entity17 tumbled under the challenge of @entity19 @entity17 fell into the penalty area after the collision but it was unclear where contact had taken place ‘ everyone can have a different opinion			1
the same way against @entity9 there was no discussion , today there was no discussion too			0
‘ we are speaking about two matches , six points , we had one out of six when two crucial decisions would give us six points			2
‘ what matters are the points			2
the decisions , the normal tendency is for people to forget the decisions			0
’ @entity0 also hinted that @entity17 , who scored in the draw at @entity9 and was excellent again here , is being driven out of @entity90 football because of persistent fouling			1
he added : ‘ people in love with football in this country , people must be in love with @entity17			1
hazard falls after contact with @entity19 , who appears to win the ball , so @entity10 did n't award the @entity99 a penalty ‘ the way match to match he 's being punished by opponents and not protected by referees , maybe one day we wo n't have @entity17			1
‘ it 's one , two , three , four , five or 10 aggressive fouls against him			0
they kick and kick and kick , and the kid resists			0
‘ he 's a very honest guy in the way he plays , but that 's another problem			0
’ @entity3 ’s bench demanded a red card when they mistakenly believed @entity19 had taken out the @entity3 forward when he was in on goal			1
@entity0 continued to berate the officials and referee @entity10 after his side were n't awarded a penalty the @entity99 boss , complaing to @entity10 , failed to contain his anger during the match at @entity4 @entity0 added : ‘ hazard , honest as always , tells me in his opinion that it was not a foul or a red card			1
so that is good , in spite of the fact mr @entity10 was too slow to follow that ball			0
‘ he was 40 yards away , but made the right decision			0
it was the decision when he was 10m away ( the penalty ) he could n't make			2
’ incredibly @entity0 missed @entity130 twice kicking man of the match @entity131 during an ugly incident in front of both technical areas			1
instead the @entity3 manager snapped : ‘ i did n't see that			1
but it was like the back - not like @entity139 in the face ? ’			0
@entity0 claims he missed this incident when @entity130 appeared to kick @entity131 in the back @entity0 complained there was a ' clear campaign ' against his @entity3 side following the draw at @entity9			1
@entity145 assessed whether key decisions were fair during the @entity148 clash between @entity31 and @entity3			1
offside ? @entity17 narrowly kept the ball in out wide and whipped a shot past @entity32 - the striker was being marked by @entity152 - which rebounded off the post to @entity155			1
his shot was tapped in by @entity32			0
@entity31 defenders ' appeals were in vain			2
decision : goal for @entity3			2
hand of @entity162 @entity36 fell on to a ball after blocking @entity155 's run on to the ball , with the @entity167 playmaker and @entity0 appealing for a penalty			1
no - one else nearby did and referee @entity10 was unmoved			0
on the spot @entity130 flew in late on @entity131 and @entity10 had no hesitation in pointing to the spot			0
the @entity3 defender 's challenge gave him no choice in the moments before half - time , but @entity0 came out for the second half talking into the official 's ear			1
disappearing balls @entity0 continually complained in the second half when @entity184 took his time to put the ball back into play with a goal kick			2
hazard hacked ? the @entity3 boss erupted when @entity17 burst forwards and went down under the challenge of @entity19			1
@entity0 complained to fourth official @entity45 and wanted a red card as the @entity31 defender was the last man , but replays showed @entity19 won the ball			1
sporting play @entity200 kicked the ball out because @entity32 took a blow to the head			0
rather than return the ball , @entity204 took the throw - in as normal and won a corner , which @entity31 cleared			1
grey area , and in @entity3 's favour on this occasion			2
@entity0 continued to unleash his anger towards the linesmen and fourth officials at @entity4 that was a clear reference to @entity139 ’s slap on @entity217 during @entity219 ’s victory over @entity220 , for which he went unpunished			2
@entity0 also refused to criticise @entity14 after they signed @entity221 for the rest of the season from his parent club @entity224			1
he added : ‘ if @entity226 and the @entity148 allow it , they allow it			0
i think any player from the @entity224 team , if @entity14 wants them , they can bring him			2
‘ if they do it with other players , they do well			0
if they are allowed to do that , they 'll do that			0
’ the @entity3 boss refused to criticise former @entity99 star @entity221 's transfer to @entity14 @entity0 was animated on the touchline throughout the 5 - 3 defeat at @entity4 the @entity3 boss had to be restrained from going onto the pitch by one of his coaching staff the first - half performance was too much for @entity0 as he stormed off down the tunnel before the whistle @entity31 chief @entity249 admitted he was stunned by the result as @entity3 slipped to their second defeat of the season			1
they were beaten 3 - 0 at @entity253 on december 3 , but this was a convincing performance at @entity4			2
he added : ‘ the most important thing is to congratulate my players			0
there was a great atmosphere out on the pitch and for our supporters to			0
‘ for me , it 's only three points			0
it is a good victory against @entity3 , one of the best teams in the world			2
it 's only three points			0
‘ we 've started to improve a lot in the last few months			0
i think that we are more strong now			0
’ hazard , scoring @entity3 's second , was n't awarded a penalty in the second - half which incensed @entity0 @entity31 striker @entity131 celebrates after his fine performance inspired the 5 - 3 win over @entity3			1
