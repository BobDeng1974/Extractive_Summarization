members of @entity2 have lashed out against the @entity3 after an investigation showed that the elite agency spent an average of just 25 minutes on training for each of its officers in 2013 , a situation investigators called ' unacceptable ' officers in other law enforcement agencies spent up to one - fourth of their on - the - job time in training during the same year			1
in previous years the @entity3 had sent special agents through as many as eight training classes			1
but between 2012 and 2013 , it offered just one			2
' we all are in agreement the levels are unacceptably low , ' said @entity18 , one of the investigators who testified before the @entity20			0

@entity40 is the ultimate insider , with a resume that includes several years at the helm of the agency 's presidential protection division until his retirement in 2011			2
he was appointed to fill a vacancy at the top of the agency 's pyramid when @entity52 resigned last year , following a series of embarrassing security lapses			2
@entity55 reported that the investigation concluded with recommendations to add new personnel to correct the training deficit – 200 new uniformed officers and 85 new special agents			1
one panelist said those new hires might be just a ' down payment ' on a larger hiring binge			0
but @entity66 on the committee doubt more spending will right the ship			0
the @entity3 already employs 6,300 people and @entity2 has over-funded it during the last two years , providing more money than it asked for			2
the newly formed @entity72 first met after a fence jumper managed to enter the @entity74 and an armed gunman fired shots at the presidential mansion – with agents going four days before they realized a bullet had broken an upstairs window			1
panelists said the @entity3 should clean house and install all new management			0
this week the second - in - command @entity84 transferred to a job in the @entity87			0
' no organization is perfect , ' said @entity24 , one of the panelists			0
' it 's not a weakness to acknowledge there are problems			0
accept them and move forward			0

it used to be one of the most respected agencies in our government			0
' no exit : @entity3 deputy director @entity84 resigned this week , only to pop up in a mysterious appointment to a job with @entity87 ' i 'm sure they 're all nice people , ' @entity126 rep. @entity125 chimed in , ' but they have to realize they are very lucky to have their jobs			1
' and agents in federal law enforcement are also paid more than their counterparts in local police forces , he said , who ' are out there fighting the real crime , the daily , day - to - day crime that everyone wants fought			1
' ' when i hear about low morale in the @entity3 , they ought to be ashamed , ' he carped			1
@entity142 @entity141 rep. @entity141 said it was hard to imagine a low - morale @entity3 , given the agency 's pop culture image			1
' did these guys not watch the movies ? ' he asked			0
' those people are really excited about becoming @entity3 agents			2
' committee chairman @entity151 of @entity152 and ranking @entity154 @entity153 of @entity155 said they are considering a plan to pare down the agency 's portfolio by taking away its mission of stopping counterfeiting , one of its earliest historical functions			2
