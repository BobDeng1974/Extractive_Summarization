by @entity0 published : 16:10 est , 3 july 2013 updated : 05:10 est , 4 july 2013 a toddler with cerebral palsy will get the operation he needs to help him walk thanks to the generosity of @entity7 readers			1
two - year - old @entity8 was turned down for funding by the @entity10 while just a few miles away an aspiring topless model was given a free breast enlargement			1
the decision caused fury when reported last week			0
but a deluge of support from readers contributed to the £ 24,000 raised in just one day on a fundraising web page set up for @entity8			2
thanks : @entity8 , pictured with his mother @entity19 , can now undergo the selective dorsal rhizotomy surgery to help walk after @entity7 readers donated thousands of pounds the complex operation – selective dorsal rhizotomy – costs £ 25,000			1
@entity8 ’s mother @entity24 , 30 , praised the @entity7 and said : ‘ wow – what a massive response			0
thank you all so much			0
the generosity of the public does n’t make the @entity10 decision the right one but it means @entity8 can now have the operation that he needs			1
’ miss @entity24 , of @entity33 , said @entity8 has splints on his legs and , because his balance is poor , he uses a walking frame to get around			0
@entity8 was referred for surgery at @entity39			2
but when a surgeon applied to @entity41 for funding , he was turned down as the procedure is not yet routinely covered by the @entity10			2
a spokesman said funding was granted only in ‘ exceptional cases ’ , adding that proposals are being considered to offer the operation more widely later in the year			0
priorities : @entity50 , left , was refused funding for an operation which could help him walk while aspiring model @entity54 , right , had her breasts enlarged to 36dd at a cost of £ 4,800 to taxpayers the case contrasted sharply with that of @entity61 , who had a breast enlargement on the @entity10 at nearby @entity63 , which is also part of the @entity65			1
under @entity10 guidelines , cosmetic surgery should be funded only when a local trust deems it is needed to protect a patient ’s health			2
miss @entity61 , who works in telesales , convinced doctors that having a flat chest was causing her severe emotional distress			0
after funding was approved by her local primary care trust , she had a £ 4,800 operation which increased her breasts from @entity78 to @entity79			0
outrage : @entity24 , whose son @entity8 , two , needs a specialist operation in order to walk without a frame , slammed the @entity10 for refusing to pay for the operation			1

@entity8 has cerebral palsy and needs selective dorsal rhizotomy surgery to help him walk
the two - year - old was turned down for funding to have surgery on the @entity10
but an aspiring model living a few miles away was approved for a boob job
