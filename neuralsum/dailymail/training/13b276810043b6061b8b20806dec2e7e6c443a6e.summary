@entity0 slammed the outgoing @entity2 chief for demand @entity0 has taken a vicious sideswipe at outgoing @entity2 chief @entity5 over the demand for @entity7 to pay more money to @entity9			1
he compared the £ 1.7 billion bill , which @entity11 blames on mr @entity5 , to the way @entity13 ’s staff sabotaged computers when they left the @entity15 in 2001			1
the chief whip fiercely criticised the @entity18 president , who steps down in the next few weeks , for failing to mention the issue when he visited @entity11 last week			1
‘ the timing just as the @entity18 are leaving is most surprising , ’ mr @entity0 told @entity20			1
‘ it ’s almost as though this @entity18 decided , as was the case when @entity13 ’s team left the @entity15 , to deliberately sabotage computer keyboards for the incoming @entity27 team			1
’ when @entity27 took office , his aides found that all the @entity30 had been removed from computer keyboards and the desk drawers were glued shut , among other ‘ pranks ’			1
@entity35 had a heated clash with mr @entity5 when the financial demand was discussed at an @entity2 summit on friday			1
the former @entity40 prime minister said mr @entity35 had ‘ misunderstood ’ the issue and that the payment , due on december 1 , was in line with normal @entity2 rules			1
interrupting mr @entity5 , the prime minister said : ‘ you have totally failed to understand the consequences of your actions			2
‘ it is no good you trying to claim this is some kind of public relations misunderstanding			0
this is £ 2 billion of @entity7 taxpayers ’ money and i am not prepared to accept it			0
’ last night , mr @entity35 faced another challenge to his plans to renegotiate @entity7 ’s relationship with the @entity2 as @entity63 chancellor @entity62 vowed to block his cap on immigration from within @entity66			2
the outgoing @entity18 president @entity5 said @entity35 had ' misunderstood ' and that the payments were in line with normal @entity2 rules @entity13 's staff admitted to pulling ' a few pranks ' on employees of @entity27 before the latter moved into @entity15 offices at the beginning of his term asked if they would ‘ vote for @entity76 if i thought they could win the constituency i live in ’ , 31 per cent of those surveyed said they agreed			1
that figure was made up of 33 per cent of @entity84 voters , 25 per cent @entity85 and 18 per cent @entity87 supporters			0
the @entity90 / @entity89 survey put the @entity91 and @entity87 neck - and - neck on 33 per cent – a boost for the @entity91 who are up five points from a fortnight ago			0
but its findings on the popularity of @entity76 will be alarming to the main three parties			0
she said : ‘ @entity63 will not tamper with the fundamental principles of free movement in the @entity2 ’ – but added that she would help mr @entity35 ’s efforts to tackle the abuse of benefits by migrants			2
the run - ins with the @entity2 came as mr @entity35 was warned his leadership will be in trouble if , as expected , his party loses the @entity111 by - election on november 20 to @entity114 @entity113 , who is now standing for @entity76			2
eurosceptic mps warned a defeat would provoke a full - scale conservative crisis			0
@entity84 mp @entity118 said : ‘ if we lose @entity111 , there will be serious questions about the strategy at the top of the party			0
’ defeat could spark a revolt by 100 @entity127 over the government ’s decision to opt back in to the @entity130			0
the government has decided to opt out of more than 130 @entity66 criminal justice measures on december 1 – then immediately opt back in to 35 of them which it thinks are beneficial to @entity7			0
home secretary @entity136 warned that failing to rejoin the warrant scheme would force @entity7 to release more than 500 inmates from jail , including rapists and murderers , and make it harder to force other @entity2 nations to hand over terrorists for trial in @entity7			2
mrs may said ditching the arrest warrant would also lead to @entity7 becoming ‘ a honeypot for all of @entity66 ’s criminals on the run from justice ’ and added : ‘ @entity7 criminals would be able to hop on to the @entity149 or fly to @entity150 , safe in the knowledge we would n’t be able to get them back to prosecute them			0

@entity0 blamed outgoing @entity2 chief @entity5 for the bill
described timing as the @entity18 are leaving as ' most surprising '
likened ' sabotage ' to that of @entity13 's staff before @entity27
*workers* cut *phone* *chords* and took ' w ' off keyboards before leaving offices
