by @entity0 two young brothers dubbed ' demons from hell ' after making their neighbours ' lives a misery are still getting into trouble with the law nearly a decade later			1
@entity9 and @entity10 were both given anti-social behaviour orders in 2006 when they were just 11 and 12			1
it was hoped the @entity13 would help put a stop to their loutish behaviour which included throwing knives , starting fires and letting down tyres in their hometown of @entity20 in @entity21			1
but fast - forward eight years and it seems not much has changed , with both brothers - who were once nicknamed the ' @entity24 ' - having racked up a string of criminal convictions			1
and in the case of the brothers , it seems they decided to continue down the road of misdemeanors and petty crime			1
@entity10 , now 20 , was yesterday sentenced to a 12 - month probation order at @entity48 after pleading guilty to burglary			1
he was also ordered to pay £ 570			2
it is his fourth criminal conviction to date			1
meanwhile is brother @entity9 , now 18 , has been in and out of prison six times since he and his brother were first given two - year @entity13 in 2006			1
it demanded the pair behave or face five years in a young offenders institution but both brothers now admit they just saw the @entity13 as badges of honour			1
@entity9 told documentary makers : ' the asbo really did n't bother me			1
it was like : " we 've got one , you have n't			2
we 've been to the police station and to court "			2
they were a badge of honour			2
' the boys claim they grew up in a troubled household			2
abandoned by their mother at a young age and left in the sole care of their father , they said they became used to committing antisocial behaviour and crime			1
@entity9 said : ' my mum was n’t there for us			1
we did n’t have the family support we needed			2
' i thought what ’s the point ? i may as well go out and get in trouble because i ’m having more fun with that than i am with my family			1
' during their reign of terror in their small community , the brothers often set things a light , which on one occasion resulted in the pair both suffering severe burns after @entity9 placed a can of foam on a fire and it exploded			1
' @entity103 from hell ' : @entity10 , 12 , and @entity105 , 11 , pictured soon after getting their asbos in 2006			1
they are both shown with injuries after @entity110 put a can of foam on to a bonfire and it exploded @entity9 said : ' me and my brother were setting fire bins , anything we could really			1
we ’d make fires in the street			0
we even set fire to one of the neighbour ’s car			1
we did it for attention			0
' we were doing general kids stuff - knocking on people ’s door , running off , putting bricks through windows , smashing up neighbours cars , smashing the fences , jumping over back gardens			1
' @entity29 added : ' i did used to find it funny to go out there and cause trouble			0
everything i did was a laugh			0
' i thought it ’s funny to throw an egg or to smash someone ’s fence down or to rob someone ’s car			2
' at 10 years old , the boys ’ petty crimes escalated to burglaries and robberies			1
@entity29 admitted : ' it was n’t just once a week it			0
it was constant offending - every single day			2
' @entity9 added : ' we were taking anything we could - @entity157 , playstations , any mobile phones , gold			1
anything you could carry under your arm we ’d take it			0
' and we ’d sell it straight away so when the police came around they ’d have no evidence on us so they ’d have to release us			0
' he added : ' when we robbed people with a knife we ’d say give me all your shit out of your pockets now , otherwise you ’re going to get stabbed			0
' the reason people took it so seriously was because people had heard from our neighbours what we were like and we ’d stop at nothing to get what we wanted			0
' back in court : @entity10 , now 20 , was yesterday sentenced to a 12 - month probation order for burglary despite receiving the @entity13 , the brothers say they still found a way to carry out their criminal activities			1
@entity29 said : ' my asbo never banned me from coming in to @entity48 town centre			2
' there are a lot of shops that are quite easy for shoplifters			0
my brother and i did n’t used to care			0
we ’d walk in to a shop like it was our own shop and take what we wanted			0
' @entity9 added : ' when i was younger people probably saw me as a bit of psychopath			1
they said we did n’t have empathy , we did n’t care about people			0
we did n’t see it like that			0
we just thought why should we care about people			0
' but since 2006 , @entity29 claims he has tried to get his life back on track			2
he said : ' i ’m well known for bad things			0
i do n’t want to be known for that anymore			0
all i can do is apologise for what i ’ve done			0
' i ’m now just thinking positive			0
i ’m going to get myself somewhere to live and i ’m going to get a job and star working			0
' his brother , however , does n't share his concerns			0
@entity9 , who was released from @entity218 prison , @entity21 , last month , said : ' i ’m not bothered about going back [ to jail ]			1
it does n’t bother me because i ’m not scared of jail			0
' that ’s why i go back so many times because i ’m not scared			2
' he added : ' in jail you get three meals a day , a warm bed and a tv , you get people looking after you			0
' some people have got more on the inside than they have on the outside			0
that ’s why most people go back to jail because they ’ve got less on the outside than they do in jail			2
