by @entity0 published : 08:30 est , 30 april 2013 updated : 10:15 est , 30 april 2013 it seems there is only one thing more irritating than the rotund opera singer from the @entity6 tv commercials – any attempt to do away with him			1
two commercials where the character was attacked drew more complaints than any other to the @entity12 ( @entity12 ) last year			1
the @entity14 character , @entity15 , created by @entity16 singer @entity15 , was designed to be deliberately annoying as he repeatedly blasted out the company jingle			1
viewers complained the ad was potentially harmful to children @entity22 as he appears in the ad unsurprisingly , the price comparison website thought the nation would welcome a series of creative and funny efforts to wipe him off our tv screens			1
however , it appears many were upset by the dastardly comic book methods they came up with			0
the first commercial featured former @entity40 left back , @entity22 , who is famous for his hefty left foot , aiming a football at the annoying @entity15			1
more than 1,000 people complained that kicking a football into the singer ’s stomach was likely to set a bad example to children			1
the @entity12 disagreed , insisting most people would understand it was light - hearted and comical			1
the second commercial saw @entity51 , the @entity52 sports presenter and former tennis player , firing a rocket launcher at the character in a bid to kill him off			1
this time there were 797 complaints from people who were unhappy at the suggested violence			2
again the @entity12 backed the company , saying the images were clearly meant to be a joke , while @entity15 was unharmed			1
the two commercials feature at the top of a list of the ten most complained about advertisements of 2012 in the watchdog ’s annual report published today			1
in third place was a more serious advertisement by @entity73 for its controversial series , @entity75 , which was deemed to have sexualised a teenage girl			0
the poster showed the 15 - year - old blonde , who was heavily made up , spilling out of a low cut top that revealed her breasts and cleavage			2
the broadcaster was also criticised over a second poster of a 10 - year - old boy with an aggressive expression which was deemed to have stereotyped youngsters from the traveller community			0
one commercial saw @entity51 , the @entity52 sports presenter and former tennis player , firing a rocket launcher at the @entity6 character in a bid to kill him off the watchdog ’s annual report reveals that it rejected the vast majority of the 31,298 complaints received about 18,990 ads last year			1
among those to be cleared were images of a naked rambler character in a tv ad for @entity105 ham , which provoked complaints from more than 300 viewers that it was unsuitable to be seen by children			1
@entity111 came under fire last @entity113 for a commercial that suggested the job of preparing for the festivities was essentially woman ’s work			2
women complained it promoted sexist stereotypes while men , including @entity123 , were unhappy that it failed to recognise the value of dads			0
however , the @entity12 sided with the supermarket which produced research showing that mums really do carry the burden of organising @entity113			1
the organisation received more than 300 complaints about advertisements on the @entity135 channel of the @entity137 betting firm , which poked fun at transsexuals			1
it could not make a ruling as the firm is based in @entity143 , however it did censure the firm over a similar commercial that appeared on @entity147 tv			0
surprisingly , the @entity148 was responsible for one of the most controversial advertisements of the year			0
its tv ad showed a man and his family coping with his diagnosis , treatment and eventual recovery from cancer , only for him to die by choking to death on a piece of food			0
more than 144 complained , however the @entity12 ruled the strong storyline was justified because it carried an important message that relatively simple first aid techniques can prevent a tragedy			2
other commercials in the top ten , included a @entity168 ad where a dog was apparently being fed @entity113 pudding , which might be harmful , and a @entity172 ’s cereal ad which some thought was distressing because it showed a man being attacked by a snake			1
the @entity12 partly upheld complaints about a tv ad for the @entity178 which showed a man receiving brain surgery			2
some viewers thought the theme was distressing			0
the watchdog ’s work led to just 3,700 ads being changed or withdrawn last year			2
its chairman , lord @entity186 , the former @entity188 , said : ‘ we want to make sure that consumers are n’t being misled , misinformed , harmed or offended			0
‘ they need to be able to make proper , informed choices about what products and services are available to them			0
and we want to make sure that there is a fair comparison between advertisers , so that responsible marketing is n’t being under - cut by the irresponsible			0

@entity137 ( @entity233 theme , 311 complaints , out of remit ) commercial on @entity135 channel made fun of transsexuals			2
no ruling as company registered in @entity143			0

@entity172 ’s @entity248 ( 234 complaints , not upheld ) man attacked by snake as he tried to capture it in kitchen			1
