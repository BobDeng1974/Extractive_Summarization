by @entity0 an independent @entity3 could open its doors to a huge influx of immigrants who would fill a city the size of @entity10 , @entity2 chiefs have claimed			1
the @entity13 @entity12 ’s most detailed report to date on the seismic impact of a @entity16 vote will be published next week , which includes an in - depth analysis of demographic changes			2
a separate @entity3 ’s weaker fiscal position would mean a rapidly ageing population would have to be countered by a massive rise in foreign workers – a policy endorsed by the @entity24			1
strategy : @entity26 wants to lift restrictions on @entity29 immigration if he wins the referendum over the 20 years from the first year of independence in 2016 , @entity32 chiefs have calculated that net migration – the difference between those leaving and those arriving on these shores – would have to increase at an annual rate of 24,000			1
by 2035 - 36 , that would take the total to an eye - watering 480,000 – a near 9 per cent rise on @entity3 ’s current population , placing unprecedented strain on health services and housing			1
the alternative would be to increase taxes or slash public spending to ensure the government could afford services for the growing number of elderly pensioners			0
next week ’s paper – set to be launched in @entity3 by chief secretary to the treasury @entity56 – is being billed as one of the most extensive financial analyses since the last @entity12 examined , and rejected , joining the euro			0
top civil servants using independently - verified modelling have been working on the project for months , and aim to produce a definitive figure of the ‘ @entity66 dividend ’ for every @entity3 family			1
their five main findings are : @entity3 ’s @entity70 population will rise from 1.04million in 2010 to 1.49million in 2066			1
but the working age population is only expected to increase from 3.3million to 3.6million			1
that will create a ‘ dependency ratio ’ of 2.41 workers for every pensioner , compared to 2.64 in other parts of the @entity13			0
analysis : @entity56 @entity26 ’s proposed solution is to lift restrictions on @entity29 immigration if he wins the referendum , bringing in more workers from abroad			0
but despite repeated requests for precise estimates , the @entity83 has so far failed to produce detailed information			0
a senior @entity2 source said next week ’s paper has modelled a ‘ high migration ’ scenario , which could reduce the dependency ratio to the same as the @entity13 ’s if there is not a similar influx south of the @entity94			0
‘ to get the demographics simply to match the @entity13 , @entity3 would have to go up to the “ high migration scenario ” , which is 24,000 people a year net , so that ’s more than tripling in migration relative to @entity3 within the @entity13 , ’ the source said			1
‘ over the 20 - year period that we looked at that would basically be the equivalent of adding the population of @entity10 to the @entity3 population			1
’ @entity107 , @entity3 @entity108 spokesman for transport , infrastructure and climate change , said : ‘ migrant workers play a vital role in @entity3 ’s economy , and many of our successful businesses would not be able to cope without them			1
‘ but under the @entity24 ’s hare - brained separation plans , we would need an open - door approach just to have a fighting chance of balancing the books			2
that would require a different immigration policy to the rest of the @entity13 , which would without question mean border controls were an absolute necessity			0
‘ not only would that be divisive and inconvenient , it would harm the @entity3 economy , which is why breaking up @entity13 is such a bad idea			2
’ @entity133 ’s pensions spokesman @entity132 added : ‘ pooling and sharing our resources across the whole of the @entity13 means pensions are more affordable in @entity3			1
only separation puts the pensions of @entity3 at risk			0
’ he added : ‘ @entity26 needs to come clean about how much extra immigration would be needed to pay for pensions in a separate @entity3			2
’ a record 248,000 immigrants are already living in @entity3 after an influx of migrants from @entity146			0
the total number of people living in @entity3 , but born outside the @entity13 , now stands at 7 per cent of the population			2
but mr @entity26 plans to go far beyond official projections that @entity3 will be home to 9,000 more foreigners every year by relaxing rules on minimum salary levels for entry			0
a spokesman for finance secretary @entity157 said : ‘ @entity3 is one of the wealthiest countries in the world , more prosperous per head than the @entity13 , @entity162 and @entity163 – but we need the powers of independence to ensure that wealth properly benefits everyone in our society			2
‘ on immigration , net migration to @entity3 is already more than 10,000 a year , and independence will allow us to have a flexible policy to suit our economic needs			0
’ he added : ‘ it is deeply revealing , but not surprising , that the @entity2 ’s main attack on independence plays the immigration card , as the @entity180 establishment panders to a @entity182 agenda			0

24,000 extra migrants a year needed in independent @entity3 - @entity32
by 2035 - 36 , that would mean a near 9 *%* rise on @entity3 ’s population
an independent @entity3 would have larger fiscal deficit per head than @entity13
an independent @entity3 would have a larger fiscal deficit per head than the @entity13 from the outset in 2016 - *17* ;
there will be a *continued* decline in @entity200 *oil* *revenues* , putting extra *pressure* on public finances if @entity3 is not part of the @entity66 ;
@entity3 has a more rapidly ageing population than the rest of the @entity13 , driven by a shrinking working - age population ;
there would be huge costs to create a new state , and a *premium* on *borrowing* rates could send *interest* rates *soaring* ;
*key* @entity24 policies , such as an increase in free *childcare* and a cut in *corporation* tax , would cost at least *£* *1.6billion* - a - year .
