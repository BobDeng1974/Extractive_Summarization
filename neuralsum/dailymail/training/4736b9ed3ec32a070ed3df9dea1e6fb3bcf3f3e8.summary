which country boasts the best league in @entity2 and how do we determine such ? heard that before ? one suggestion was to have the 20 teams from two nations play each other in order of position - 1st versus 1st , 2nd versus 2nd and so on – and calculate a score based on the outcomes			0
this @entity13 style scenario will never happen , of course , but this week an @entity17 - @entity16 playoff of sorts on the continental stage is taking place			0
it will not provide a definitive answer to the @entity23 - versus - @entity25 debate , but we will learn how the top clubs from those respective countries are set to fare at the onset of the @entity31 campaign			0
@entity32 ( out of shot ) strikes the winner past the despairing @entity36 keeper @entity35 @entity32 ( centre ) jumps for joy in celebration of his winning striker for @entity41 over @entity36 and the @entity43 action has given a clear indicator that the @entity23 is lagging behind its @entity46 counterparts			1
@entity47 got things underway by beating @entity49 2 - 0 on tuesday night with a display far more convincing than the scoreline suggested			1
@entity41 added another win for the @entity46 when a late @entity32 striker edged out a resilient @entity36			1
the total number of @entity43 opening round defeats by @entity23 teams between 2004/05 and 2013/14 : 2 the number of @entity43 opening round defeats by @entity23 teams during 2014/15 season : 2 and even unfancied @entity60 , beset by injuries , managed to get in on the act with a precious point at in - form @entity64			1
some might even argue there 's was a morale victory given that nobody gave the @entity46 a chance before kick - off			0
next up is the @entity70 , where @entity71 remain the @entity23 's remaining opportunity to land a blow on the @entity25 in this first round of @entity31 fixtures when they entertain @entity76 at @entity77			2
@entity64 midfielder @entity78 slots the ball past @entity80 to give the @entity81 the lead @entity83 ( second left ) is congratulated by his @entity60 team - mates for equalising against @entity64 @entity87 wheels away in delight after notching the @entity46 ' second against @entity49 @entity71 vs @entity76 – thursday , @entity89 after a five - year absence @entity71 return to @entity2 and manager @entity91 is promising to make every effort to win the competition			1
the @entity94 sees the @entity70 as a platform to greater things rather than an unwanted distraction			0
like the @entity71 , @entity76 were fifth last season and have former @entity64 forward @entity99 – an £ 18million signing in january – as their key offensive threat			2
but @entity99 and co have struggled this season			0
they have picked up just two points in the league and needed penalties to get past second tier @entity108 in the cup			0
@entity71 , likewise , were slow to find their stride but a convincing 2 - 0 win at @entity113 on saturday gives them momentum heading into their first taste of thursday - sunday football since 2009/10			1
sportsmail ratings : @entity71 7 @entity76 6 @entity91 is hoping to hit the ground running in the @entity70 as @entity71 face @entity76 @entity119 gets away from @entity120 during @entity71 's last @entity31 game back in 2010			2

@entity123 draw first blood after @entity47 beat @entity49 2 - 0 on tuesday night
@entity41 seal a late 1 - 0 victory over @entity36 at the @entity127 with a @entity32 strike
@entity64 only able to draw against @entity60 at @entity130
@entity71 start their @entity70 campaign against @entity76
