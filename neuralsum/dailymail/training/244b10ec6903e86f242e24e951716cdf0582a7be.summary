by @entity1 reporter published : 16:15 est , 24 january 2014 updated : 16:28 est , 24 january 2014 the @entity4 sheriff best known for forcing jail inmates to wear pink underwear and live in tents - as well as ' deputizing ' actor @entity8 and organizing a ' posse ' to investigate whether president @entity10 is a @entity15 citizen - announced yesterday that he has put 38 jail inmates on a ' bread and water diet			1
' @entity18 sheriff @entity17 's self - proclaimed ' toughest sheriff ' - issued a press release on thursday announcing that the 38 inmates will be dining on nothing but bread and water as punishment for ' desecrating the @entity15 flag			2
' ' these inmates have destroyed the @entity15 flag that was placed in their cells , ' @entity26 says in the release			2
' tearing them , writing on them , stepping on them , throwing them in the toilet , trash or wherever they feel , it 's a disgrace to those who have fought for our county [ sic ]			0
besides this is government property that they are destroying , and we will take action against those who act this way			0
' ' tough ' : sheriff @entity26 has put jail inmates who damaged @entity15 flags on a diet of bread and water @entity26 's bread and water meal plan is n't the only jail - house cuisine served in the @entity18 jail system - the sheriff also punishes problem inmates by forcing them to eat his ' nutraloaf , ' or ' loaf ' for short			1
@entity26 's loaf is a mash of vegetables , fruit , meat and other nutrients that are blended together and baked into a bread - like loaf			1
' quite frankly , i do n't think i 'd eat this , ' @entity26 said before trying - and gagging on - the loaf during a press conference announcing that federal court had upheld his decision to use it in his jails			2
in addition to the news about flags being placed in the cells , and putting those who damage the flags on a diet of bread and water , @entity26 - who is well known for his media gimmicks - announced yesterday that he also requires the inmates to sing @entity86 in the morning and @entity87 at night			1
loaf : @entity26 also forces inmates to eat ' herbaloaf ' - a mash of fruit vegetables and other nutrients during the holidays , the sheriff traditionally plays @entity96 music throughout the jail - 24 hours a day			1
the 81 - year - old @entity26 has been the sheriff in @entity18 - which includes the cities of @entity100 and @entity101 - for more than 20 years			2
in that time , he has created controversy over his policies on illegal immigrants , targeting his political opponents and abusing power			0
last month , the sheriff was ordered to pay two former newspaper executives $ 3.75 million after he had them thrown in jail on bogus charges that were almost immediately dropped			0
the two former executives - @entity112 and @entity113 - maintain that they were targeted by the vengeful sheriff because their newspaper , the @entity115 , often was critical of the sheriff			0
pretty in pink : @entity26 's most well - known gimmick is making jail inmates wear pink underwear @entity26 also has been the target of a @entity123 investigation into whether he directs his officers to racially profile @entity125 for traffic stops			1
according to @entity123 lawsuit against the sheriff , @entity26 's practices are ' discriminatory and otherwise unconstitutional law enforcement actions against @entity125 who are frequently stopped , detained and arrested on the basis of race , color , or national origin			1
' the sheriff also made headlines when a @entity139 - winning article in the @entity141 newspaper revealed that his office had neglected to investigate several hundred sex crimes reported to his office that occurred in a small , unincorporated town called @entity146			0
hundreds of victims - including dozens of children who claimed to have been molested - said that they called the sheriff 's office about the alleged sexual abuse but they were never investigated			0
@entity152 : @entity26 keeps jail inmates in outdoor tents			1
he often says that if soldiers can sleep in tents , so can inmates critics of the sheriff 's immigration policies say that he spends too much time chasing illegal immigrants - which is not technically in his job description , but helps earn him votes during election years - and not enough time policing unincorporated parts of the county or serving felony warrants , both of which are in his job description			2
@entity26 says he plans to run for yet another term as the county 's top law enforcement officer			0
he 'll be 85 years old the next time there is an election for sheriff in @entity18 .			0
