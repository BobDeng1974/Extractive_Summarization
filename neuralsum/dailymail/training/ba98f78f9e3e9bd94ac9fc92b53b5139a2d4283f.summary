a photograph forgotten for almost 80 years could hold the key to solving the mysterious disappearance of @entity3			1
the picture , taken immediately before the legendary aviator launched her ill - fated attempt to circumnavigate the globe from @entity8 in june 1937 , shows a distinctive patch of aluminum bolted to the side of her @entity12			1
not seen in any other photographs of the plane , the metal plate appears to match a piece of aluminum recovered from a remote @entity18 in 1991 - raising the possibility that she perished as a starving castaway having survived a terrifying crash - landing			1
indeed , the picture which was recovered from the vaults of the @entity40 , is the only one in existence to show the apparent aluminum covering , which @entity31 believes was installed after @entity3 suffered a rough landing			1
convinced , @entity31 's forensic analysis of the plate he found in 1991 revealed it was made from the same type of aluminum commonly used in the manufacture of planes made in @entity50 in the 1930s			1
however , @entity31 's theory was dismissed when it was shown that the rivet patterns on the plate did not match those used on @entity3 's plane			1
tragic : @entity3 leans on the propeller on the right wing engine on her airplane			2
@entity3 and her navigator , @entity59 disappeared on a flight over the @entity62 in july , 1937 , and neither their plane nor their bodies were ever recovered comparison : @entity3 poses on her ' flying laboratory , ' a specially fitted @entity12 plane , as it nears completion in 1936			1
this was the plane she used for the around - the - world flight the following year that ended with her disappearance - visible on the right hand side is the special navigation window that was covered up as revealed in @entity40 photograph but now @entity31 says that he has been vidicated because the new picture suggests that his plate was not part of the plane , rather it was bolted into place before her departure from @entity8			1
if indeed , that is the case , then it challenges the accepted wisdom that @entity3 crashed into the @entity62 along with her navigator , @entity59 and died			2
' the replacement of that window had to be done in @entity8 , at a @entity91 facility that was helping @entity3 , ' @entity31 told the @entity40			1
' if we can match a rivet pattern from the repair in the photograph to a rivet pattern on the wreckage , i think it would be beyond dispute that @entity101 and @entity3 were n’t lost at sea , but made it to the island , ' said @entity31 , the executive director of the @entity105 ( @entity105 )			1
it would conclude what has become one of the most mythical and mysterious aviation disappearances in history			0
the aluminum plate brings the world closer to the resolution of this mystery , but would write a tragic final chapter			0
it would mean that instead of dying instantly in a plane crash , she and her navigator suffered from exposure , thirst and disease on @entity33 , which is otherwise known as @entity33			0
the specific repairs on @entity3 's plane was to cover over the window specially installed in the rear of the plane			1
remote : according to @entity31 @entity3 lived out her days on @entity33 - a coral atoll in the @entity62 thousands of miles from @entity129 it was used by @entity101 to take sightings of the sun and stars for navigation in the days before @entity135 and satellites			1
it is visible in all pictures of her plane taken in @entity140 before she started her attempt to fly around the world in may of 1937 from @entity140			2
however , in the june 1 , 1937 picture held by the @entity40 , the window is gone , replaced with the aluminum plate			1
' i think the window must have been broken or compromised by the hard landing in @entity8 , ' @entity31			2
' it was n’t standard equipment and they found out it would take a while to replace it , so they just took it out and patched the fuselage instead			0
' from @entity8 , @entity3 carried on eastwards to @entity157 and onwards through @entity50 , @entity158 and @entity159			2
he plane suffered various problems with her radio that sometimes left her unable to communicate			0
then on july 2 , 1937 , @entity3 set off from @entity163 , @entity164 , headed for @entity165 , 2,600 miles away			1
close - up view of an aircraft fuselage skin that is claimed to belong to famed aviatrix @entity3 's plane as shown during a press conference in @entity171 on march 16 , 1992			1
the @entity105 claims that the skin and other items including a woman 's shoe prove conclusively that @entity3 and her navigator @entity59 perished on the remote @entity18 island of @entity33 while on the final leg of a round - the - world flight in 1937 her radio antenna was damaged on take - off which was probably the reasons why she could n't hear the @entity183 there trying to make contact with her 19 hours later			1
instead all they heard was her increasingly distressing updates which finished with radio silence			0
' we are circling but can not see island , can not hear you , ' she radioed			0
' we are on the line of position 157 dash 337			0
… we are now running north and south			0
' the search for @entity3 was launched almost immediately , but was hampered by the huge distances involved			2
@entity165 is in the middle of the giant @entity62 and 1,700 miles from @entity129			0
however , during the search , planes passed over a small patch of coral called @entity33 , 400 miles from @entity165 and saw recent signs of habitation			0
however , they put that down to the tribes of @entity206 who lived there and moved on , never finding anything			0
conspiracy theories immediately sprang up about @entity3			2
for years the most popular was that she had been captured by the @entity211 and tortured to death as a spy			0
search : @entity31 has been searching for @entity3 for nearly 25 - years however , @entity31 became fixated with the idea that @entity3 did not crash into the water and died , but rather she found herself on an uninhabited island			1
' the key to it is her final message , where she says ‘ line of position 157 dash 337 , ’ @entity31 said to the @entity40			2
' that ’s a line that @entity101 calculated from the sunrise , running 337 degrees to the northwest and 157 degrees to the southeast			0
and if you follow it far enough , there are two deserted islands on it , @entity231 and @entity33			0
' it was then that @entity31 discovered the story of 68 - year - old ex-marine , @entity235 who in 1960 gave an interview to a @entity238 newspaper about his experience there in 1946 to remove a navigational device from @entity242 @entity243 said a @entity245 tribesman living on the tiny island of @entity247 told him that when he and others first arrived there in 1938 he found a partial human skeleton and a woman 's shoes			1
there was a fire pit nearby that contained the bones of small birds and fish			0
the most widely accepted theory is that the aeroplane ran out of fuel and ditched in the sea			0
there have been several searches by many different professionals eager to solve the mystery , but none have been proven			0
another popular theory is that they landed on the island of @entity33 , or @entity33 in the @entity270 , 350 miles southeast of @entity165 and fended for themselves for several months until they succumbed to injury or disease			2
improvised tools and bits of plexiglas that are consistent with that of an @entity12 window were found on the island			1
a few theorists reckon that she @entity3 was spying on @entity211 and had been captured and executed			2
this theory has been discounted by the @entity285 authorities and press			0
a rumor claimed that she was one of many women sending messages on @entity290 , an @entity292 - language @entity211 propaganda station designed to attack the @entity294 ' morale			0
an @entity296 aircraft engineer said he found a map that showed @entity3 and @entity101 may have turned round to try and refuel but crashed before getting to an airstrip			1
the most whacky theory is that she was still alive and had a different identity			0
a woman fron @entity302 successfully sued for $ 1.5m in damages from the author of a book who pursued this theory			0
more so , that meant that the search party who saw signs of habitation in 1937 and assumed they were @entity206 were wrong			0
someone else had left that evidence			0
@entity31 made sure to visit @entity247 and in 1991 discovered the scrap of aluminum 19 inches wide and 23 inches long			2
it is made from a substance called @entity320 , better known as @entity321 - which was used in very nearly all @entity285 planes built in the 1930 , including the @entity12			2
@entity31 's excitement got the better of him when he proclaimed the scrap to be evidence of @entity3 's plane			1
this was quickly ruled out when it was demonstrated to @entity31 that the rivet patterns on the piece of metal do not match her plane			1
however , @entity31 persisted and when he read that the plane 's navigational window was replaced before they took off from @entity8 he set about trying to find pictoral evidence			1
his problem was that most photographers took pictures of @entity3 with the plane from the left hand side because that was where she preferred to fly and the window was known to be on the right hand side			1
it was then that he finally found the picture in the records of the @entity40 this week .			0

new photograph could confirm theory of disappearance on july 2 , 1937
shows metal plate covering window on right hand side of @entity3 's aircraft
piece has never been seen before in pictures of ill - fated @entity12
investigator believes he found plate in 1991 on a remote @entity18 island
@entity31 will now use the picture to attempt to verify this theory
if correct , could mean @entity3 survived her crash and died on a desert island
