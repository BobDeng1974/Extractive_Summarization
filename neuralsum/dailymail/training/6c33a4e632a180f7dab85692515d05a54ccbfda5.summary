this is the little boy who could be killed by a nursery rhyme			1
tiny @entity3 , aged nine months , was born with a rare heart condition that means his heart could stop at any minute if he is shocked or startled			1
it means his mother @entity7 , from @entity8 , @entity9 , can not read him favourite nursery rhymes , such as @entity11 , in which there are sudden loud noises			1
it is a rare inherited heart condition which increases the risk of irregular heartbeats , which can lead to fainting and sudden death			1
miss @entity7 , 25 , who also has the condition , said : ‘ we have to be very careful with @entity3			1
we ca n’t sing any loud nursery rhymes to him and we have to be very careful with some of them if there are any sudden loud noises or clapping			1
' we have to read things to him very gently and only clap very quietly and slowly			2
‘ he ca n’t have any squeaky toys , no loud rattles and we have to keep him away from balloons , so he ca n’t go to children ’s parties where there are balloons			1
anything with a loud noise can stop his heart			2
’ @entity3 was diagnosed at birth with the condition			1
the young boy 's condition can be triggered by a change in temperature meaning he can not run into the sea or jump into a cold swimming pool			2
the family have not got a telephone or a doorbell as even these loud sudden noises could also fatally shock him			1
he is also unable to go on fairground rides			2
@entity3 was born with @entity21 , a rare heart condition , which means his heart could stop if he is shocked or startled miss @entity7 , who lives with partner @entity59 , 27 , a construction worker , was diagnosed with the condition at the age of 10 , after she fainted several times			1
she said : ‘ i collapsed the first time when i was swimming in a local pool			0
' i ’d just pushed off from the side of the pool when everything went black			0
i came round to find myself lying on the edge of the pool with a foil blanket wrapped around me			0
' i was told that i ’d passed out in the water and had sunk to the bottom of the pool before being hauled out			0
‘ @entity74 rushed me straight to the doctors but it took six months of tests to finally found out what was wrong with me			0
and i collapsed several further times during those months			0
’ miss @entity7 was diagnosed with @entity21 and was fitted with a pacemaker , which will restart her heart should it stop			1
long qt syndrome is a rare and serious heart condition			2
it occurs in about 1 in 2,000 people			0
the syndrome can cause fainting as well as episodes of an abnormally rapid heart rhythm , called arrhythmia			0
the arrhythmia happens because the electrical activity of the heart is disrupted			0
these episodes may be provoked by any sort of adrenalin rush through the body , often caused by a shock or start			0
not everyone with long qt syndrome will experience arrhythmia , but when it does happen it can be fatal			0
@entity21 can be genetically inherited , but it can also be caused by some medications which patients might be taking for other medical conditions			1
she and mr @entity59 were thrilled when she fell pregnant , but were worried that their baby would inherit the deadly condition			2
she said : ‘ we were just terrified that the baby would inherit it from me			0
when @entity3 was born by caesarian section we were thrilled , but then when he was only a day old , tests confirmed that he had the condition too			2
i was glad that they had discovered it early , but terrified about what the future meant for him			0
’ @entity3 ’s condition is currently being controlled by medication , but he may have to have a pacemaker fitted as he grows older			1
but the family still have to be careful not to give him a sudden shock			2
miss @entity7 said : ‘ my mother was babysitting recently and a glass shattered and the shock of the noise made him turn blue			1
' @entity74 picked him up and the colour came straight back , but we can never be too careful with him			0
’ miss @entity7 added : ‘ he ca n’t do anything that would cause adrenaline to surge around his body , so that also means that he ca n’t go on an fairground rides			1
' when its bonfire night we will have to fit him with special sound proof ear muffs as the loud bang of the fireworks could prove fatal			2
’ both his parents have been trained in @entity144 , although so far they have not needed to resuscitate him			0
miss @entity7 added : ‘ @entity59 and i are always on red alert in case anything happens and we have to save @entity3 ’s life			1
' we have to be so careful and constantly be on the look out for things that could shock him			0
we try to let him live as normal a life as possible , but it can be difficult			0
