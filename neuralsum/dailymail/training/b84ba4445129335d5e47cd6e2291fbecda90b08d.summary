by @entity0 crossing the line : @entity3 student @entity2 has written an essay detailing the inappropriate relationship her high school teacher @entity6 instigated an @entity9 teacher who worked at two elite @entity11 prep schools has quit his job after a former student published an essay last month , detailing the inappropriate relationship he instigated three years ago			1
though @entity2 ( now a rising sophomore at the @entity3 ) did n't name the teacher or the high school she attended in her essay for @entity20 , she told @entity21 that she received eight @entity23 messages within hours from other former students who had the same issue with teacher @entity6			1
@entity6 taught @entity9 at the $ 35,000 - a - year @entity26 for 14 years , before leaving last year to teach at his alma - mater @entity27			1
amid the new allegations , @entity6 has quit his job and now both schools are re-investigating the claims of sexual harassment			1
@entity32 says @entity6 crossed the student - teacher boundary when she was a 16 - year - old junior , and asked to interview him for the school newspaper			1
he agreed , replying ' it 's a date ' to her email			0
when they met up later outside the school , she wrote that he dodged her questions and turned the conversation towards romantic poetry , saying he could lend her a favorite book of his			0
at the end of the conversation , his hands brushed against her knee			2
while @entity32 said the flirting made her feel good at first , she became less comfortable with their relationship when he started getting more explicit in their email conversations			0
he said he knew how to draw a boundary with other students but not with her and talked about how her short uniform skirt made her ' so alluring '			2
so a few day later , @entity32 wrote him saying they needed to stop so she could focus on finals and ' just being 16 '			0
koetters responded ' ugh , ok , ' but continued to harass her in class and through email			0
that 's when she decided to tell her parents			0
when @entity32 and her parents went to the school to inform them about @entity6 inappropriate behavior , the administration began an investigation			1
accusations : @entity6 taught at $ 35,000 - a - year @entity26 for 14 years			1

after publishing her essay , @entity32 was contacted by several other former @entity99 students who had a similar relationship with @entity79 but were too afraid to report his behavior to the administration			1
most of these former students agreed to talk to @entity21 about their encounters with @entity79			2
one former student , identified as @entity105 , says @entity79 once told her : ' i love you in ways that are totally inappropriate for a teacher to love a student			1
' she also recalled the time they were discussing the book disgrace by @entity115 , which is about an inappropriate relationship between an @entity9 professor and a student			1
@entity105 talked about how she wanted to write an essay on the book , focusing on predators and prey			0
out of the job : koetters left @entity26 in 2013 to start teaching at @entity27 , his alma mater			1
in a statement issued sunday , the school says he is no longer employed that 's when @entity6 told her , ' just because someone is in a position of power over someone else does n't mean the relationship ca n't be mutual			1
' ' he told me that if we had sex , it could be mutual , it could me love , ' @entity105 recalls			0
she says he then put his hand on her knee			2
another 2012 graduate recalled how @entity6 would use his power over female students to turn friends against each other			1
a former student identified as @entity151 says he turned their innocent conversations about help with class into a venting session where he would complain about his wife and kids			2
@entity151 says she felt like an adult when he talked to her about his problems , but knows how wrong it was in retrospect			0
' now that i 'm close to my thirties , i realize how wrong the situation was and regret not speaking out , ' she said			0

on sunday , @entity27 issued a statement saying @entity6 no longer works there and that they ' considered a range of information and perspectives ' during the hiring process			1
@entity183 officials say they were never informed that @entity6 touched @entity32 's knee , a claim she refutes			1

the essay , however , added details not previously reported to the @entity27			2
we sincerely regret the suffering our alumna expressed through her essay			0
last week , another graduate came forward alleging an inappropriate physical relationship with the same teacher more than a decade ago			1
