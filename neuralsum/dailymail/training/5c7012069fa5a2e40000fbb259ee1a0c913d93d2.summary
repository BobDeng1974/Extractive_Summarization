@entity0 must wait a little longer to discover the great successor to @entity2 as the two main contenders will pair up in the centres to face @entity5			1
the now - retired @entity2 has anointed @entity8 centre @entity6 to assume his outside centre mantle - but the 21 - year - old will start saturday ’s opening autumn test at 12			1
the @entity13 - born battering ram has replaced @entity14 , still green after picking up a heavy knock in @entity16 at the end of last month			0
@entity8 's @entity6 was expected to start at 13 as the long - term replacement for @entity19 @entity20 , @entity6 and @entity21 ( right ) will provide the creative spark in @entity0 's backline @entity24 ( @entity25 ) , @entity26 ( @entity27 ) , @entity28 ( @entity27 ) , @entity29 ( @entity8 ) , @entity30 ( @entity31 ) , @entity32 ( @entity33 ) , @entity34 ( @entity31 ) , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 ( all @entity25 ) , @entity39 ( @entity31 , capt ) , @entity40 ( @entity31 ) , @entity41 ( @entity27 ) , @entity42 ( @entity25 )			1
replacements : @entity44 ( @entity25 ) , @entity45 ( @entity31 ) , @entity46 ( @entity8 ) , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , i @entity50 ( all @entity25 ) , @entity52 ( @entity31 )			0
that has paved the way for @entity27 ’s @entity21 to slot in for his @entity56 at outside centre , with @entity59 fit to start at full - back			1
@entity0 boss @entity61 is well known for keeping his cards close to his chest , and by pairing his two rivals for the famous 13 shirt in midfield he has not strayed from type one jot			2
from a centre pairing boasting 212 @entity0 caps that closed last term ’s @entity72 , @entity61 ’s midfield duo will line up against the @entity5 with a combined @entity56 total of three appearances			1
@entity6 ’s fourth international appearance is certainly a leap into the deep end , squaring up to the 102 - cap @entity5 captain @entity79			2
@entity80 claims his wing berth after successfully negotiating return to play protocols after concussion			0
@entity19 wipes the tears from his eyes after his final home @entity88 in last year 's six nations @entity19 has been @entity0 's talisman at outside centre for more than a decade , and will take some replacing tighthead prop @entity91 has won his fortnight - long fitness battle to ease @entity0 ’s front - row injury glut , with @entity25 team - mate @entity94 slotting in for the sidelined @entity95			1
@entity96 must do without props @entity98 , @entity99 and @entity100 , so @entity101 covers tighthead from the bench			0
@entity104 takes a seat on the bench and is in line for his first cap since june 2013 , and his second against the country of his birth			0
the 28 - year - old has battled back from heart surgery and then tearing his hamstring off the bone to return to the test arena			2
barring long - term absentee @entity117 have the luxury of selecting from strength in the back - five of the pack , with @entity122 again captain and @entity124 continuing at openside			0
@entity80 will start on the wing against @entity5 after being declared fit following a concussion			0

@entity19 retired this year after decade leading @entity0
@entity6 was expected to replace *legendary* outside centre
but injury to @entity133 means @entity6 will start with @entity21
