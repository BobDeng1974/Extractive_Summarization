it was hailed as proof of alien life , a mummified visitor from another planet			0
ten years after the remains of a six - inch ‘ space alien ’ were first discovered , they have been confirmed as ‘ human ’ by @entity10 scientists in a new documentary film @entity12			1
since the remains of the small humanoid - known as the ' @entity15 ' and nicknamed @entity16 - were discovered in @entity18 's @entity17 10 years ago there has been much speculation about its origins			1
theories have included that the bones were those of an aborted fetus , or a monkey , or even an alien that had crash - landed on earth			1
' the cat scan clearly shows internal chest organs - lungs and what appears to be the remains of a heart structure , ' he said			1
' there is absolutely no doubt that the specimen is an actual organism and that it is not a hoax of any kind			0
' this fact has been confirmed by dr. @entity67 and dr. @entity68 at @entity10			1
' in the weeks leading up to monday ’s premier of @entity12 , @entity70 enthusiasts had grown increasingly excited that the film could announce a major breakthrough in the search for extra-terrestrial life forms			0
experts say the small skeleton certainly bears many of the hallmarks of what we have come to believe aliens look like , in particular a large head overshadowing a small body			1
according to @entity18 local newspaper , a man called @entity85 found the remain on oct. 19 , 2003 when he was looking for objects of historical value in @entity89 , a ghost town in the @entity17			1
near an abandoned church , @entity85 found a white cloth containing , according to the newspaper , ‘ a strange skeleton no bigger than 15cm [ the size of a pen ]			2
it was a creature with hard teeth , a bulging head with an additional odd bulge on top			0
its body was scaly and of dark color			0
unlike humans , it had nine ribs			0
a dna sample from bone marrow extracted from the specimen , was analyzed by scientists at a prestigious @entity111 university scientists believe the unusual skeleton is human , yet it has nine ribs ' after six months of research by leading scientists at @entity10 , the @entity15 remains a profound mystery , ' said physician and @entity48 founder dr. @entity48			1
' we traveled to @entity120 @entity119 in late september 2012 to obtain detailed @entity121 , @entity123 scans and take genetic samples for testing at @entity10			2
' we obtained excellent dna material by surgically dissecting the distal ends of two right anterior ribs on the humanoid			2
' these clearly contained bone marrow material , as was seen on the dissecting microscope that was brought in for the procedure , ' @entity12 premiered in @entity132 on @entity133 and will be released online and in select theaters worldwide , starting april 22 the humanoid was first discovered in 2003 in the remote @entity17 desert region of @entity18 in the new documentary , a dna sample from bone marrow extracted from the specimen , was analyzed by scientists at a prestigious @entity111 university			1
they concluded that it was an ' interesting mutation ' of a male human that had survived post-birth for between six and eight years			2
‘ i can say with absolute certainty that it is not a monkey			0
' it is human - closer to human than chimpanzees			2
it lived to the age of six to eight , ’ said @entity67 , director of stem cell biology at @entity10 's @entity157 in @entity158			2
' obviously , it was breathing , it was eating , it was metabolizing			0
' it calls into question how big the thing might have been when it was born			0
' the small skeleton bears many of the hallmarks of what we have come to believe ets look like , in particular a large head overshadowing a small body ‘ the dna tells the story and we have the computational techniques that allows us to determine , in very short order , whether , in fact , this is human , ’ @entity67 , who performed the dna tests , explains in the film			1
in addition to studying the origins of @entity16 , @entity12 explores the subject of @entity70 and @entity166 visitation , the disclosure of secret ufo files , and the investigation of advanced energy and propulsion technologies extra-terrestrial civilizations are using to travel to @entity188			0
based on evidence gathered over the past 20 years by physician and @entity48 founder dr. @entity48 , @entity12 reveals how and why these energy technologies are being suppressed in favor of maintaining the current petrochemical system			0
@entity12 premiered in @entity132 on @entity133 and will be released online and in select theaters worldwide , starting april 22			0
scientists concluded that the skeleton was an ' interesting mutation ' of a male human that had survived post-birth for between six and eight years			1

10 years ago the bones of a six - inch skeleton with a large head were found in @entity18
there was speculation that the @entity15 humanoid , nicknamed @entity16 , was either an aborted fetus , a monkey or even an alien
now scientists at @entity10 have carried out *conclusive* dna tests which have found the remains are those of a mutated human
