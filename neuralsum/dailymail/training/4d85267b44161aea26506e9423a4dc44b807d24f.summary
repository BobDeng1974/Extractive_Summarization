by @entity0 published : 07:25 est , 22 august 2013 updated : 10:21 est , 22 august 2013 scientists are developing a simpler , cheaper and more successful method of @entity3			1
at the moment would - be parents spend thousands on the procedure that involves incubating an embryo and implanting it inside a mother 's womb			1
but @entity10 and @entity12 expert say a simplified version of the procedure , originally devised for people in developing countries , could be carried out for around £ 175 using generic fertility drugs and basic lab equipment that would fit inside a shoebox			1
scientists are developing a new cut - price ivf technique that could reduce costs by thousands of pounds			1
it was initially developed for poorer countries but it could one day be introduced to wealthier nations ' ivf is made to sound complicated but the fact is that the early embryo is not very demanding , ' said @entity28 , a fertility expert at the @entity29			1
a human embryo does n't need much beyond some basic solutions , a steady ph level and constant temperature , he said			0
the simpler approach calls for women to take cheaper fertility tablets to stimulate their ovaries to release more than one egg per month			1
in conventional @entity3 , expensive , potent drugs that are injected can produce more than 20 eggs			0
@entity28 developed the simplified technique after @entity10 colleagues asked him how @entity3 could be done in developing countries			1
@entity3 currently cost thousands but the new mothod could reduce prices to as little as £ 175			1
according to @entity47 , a fertility expert at the @entity29 , it is possible to generate the exact same conditions , or very similar , to what people are generating in a $ 60,000 ( £ 39,000 ) incubator by using two test tubes and special solutions			1
one test tube is used to prepare a solution including carbon dioxide , which creates the ideal conditions for fertilisation			0
the solution is then pipetted into a second tube , where one egg and a few thousand sperm are added , before being placed in a heating block			0
after about two to three days , any resulting embryo is examined under a microscope before being transferred into the woman			0
' my first reaction was , " you 've got to be kidding , " ' he said			0
but with two test tubes and special solutions , ' it 's possible to generate the exact same conditions , or very similar , to what people are generating in a $ 60,000 ( £ 39,000 ) incubator			1

@entity28 and colleagues estimated that about half of all people seeking infertility treatment could potentially be helped by the method			1
those who have complicated infertility problems , like men with severe sperm problems or women with very few eggs left , would still need standard ivf , however			1
in an ongoing trial in @entity100 , researchers are comparing the techniques			0
women under 36 seeking @entity3 for the first time are given a mild dose of injectable fertility drugs			1
if at least eight eggs are retrieved , half undergo traditional @entity3 , and half use the simpler method			1
a specialist who does n't know which technique was used , picks the best - looking embryo to be transferred			1
' you should not have to be rich just to have @entity3 , ' said dr @entity114 ( pictured ) , medical director for @entity115 , a private fertility centre in @entity117			2
' there are so many people who can not afford the treatment in the @entity121 that there would be huge demand if there were something cheaper available ' for the more than 100 women treated so far , the pregnancy rate was about 34 percent for both methods			0
so far , 14 babies have been born using the simplified method and 13 babies from traditional @entity3			2
the @entity132 estimates there are between 120 and 160 million couples struggling with infertility worldwide			0
' nobody thinks that infertility in developing countries is a problem but it is an even bigger problem there than in ( the @entity121 ) , ' said @entity141 , a @entity132 reproductive health expert			2
she said more people in poor countries have complications from untreated sexually spread infections than in the @entity121 , which can hurt their fertility			1
' making @entity3 affordable is a public health priority , ' she added			0
the new treatment involves using a simple solution containing carbon dioxide and mixing it with sperm and an egg dr @entity154 , director of the @entity156 and @entity155 in @entity157 , said the cheaper ivf method would be welcomed			2
he said there is considerable social pressure on young @entity157 couples to have children - and that is compounded by the fact in rural areas , many newlyweds live with the man 's family			0
' all eyes are on the newlywed couple to see if pregnancy has happened after the first month , " he said in an email			0
he said couples married for two to three months occasionally come to see him ' just to please their in - laws			0
' although the new @entity3 strategy is intended for use mainly in developing countries , doctors in rich countries are also interested			2
' you should not have to be rich just to have @entity3 , ' said dr. @entity114 , medical director for @entity115 , a private fertility center in @entity117			2
' there are so many people who can not afford the treatment ( in the @entity121 ) that there would be huge demand if there were something cheaper available			0
' in many @entity10 countries , national health systems pay for several @entity3 cycles for eligible couples but it can cost more than $ 10,000 ( £ 6,400 ) for those seeking it privately			1
for many couples , up to three cycles are necessary to create a baby			0
she has asked @entity200 's regulatory agency for fertility treatment for permission to test the simpler technique			1
some said the success rates of the cheaper ivf method would likely be lower than those for regular @entity3			2
the simplified method does not include any extensive screening of embryos or any procedures to inject sperm directly into the eggs			2
' you are n't producing as many eggs with this ( cheap ) method so the numbers will not be as high , ' said @entity218 , an emeritus professor of reproductive medicine at @entity220			2
professor @entity218 also thought training enough health professionals in developing countries might be an issue			2
still , he said the method was promising			2
because doctors were planning to use less potent fertility drugs , he said it was fine to cut back on the regular screening and daily tests used in normal ivf regimens			0
' from a technical point of view , they have proven it works , ' he said , adding it was now necessary to test the technique in developing countries			1
patient groups said doctors should offer the cheaper ivf method if it is approved			0
' @entity3 is not a one size fits all process , ' said @entity241 , deputy chief executive of @entity242 @entity200			1
' patients are being told they need all kinds of expensive procedures and this may be a good time to step back and see if that is really the case			0

parents with fertility problems currently spend thousands to conceive
but a new technique , using equipment that could fit into a shoebox , is being developed that cuts the costs to less than £ 200
the method was originally developed for poorer countries but @entity200 experts hope it will one day be available in the @entity200
