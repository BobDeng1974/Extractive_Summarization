@entity0 has warned @entity1 they still have much work to do before they secure @entity4 qualification			1
@entity1 returned to winning ways on saturday with a 3 - 1 victory over @entity7 at @entity8			1
@entity9 put @entity1 ahead with a sublime finish and @entity11 added his fourth for the club before @entity15 's own goal helped @entity1 avenge their embarrassing 5 - 3 reverse at the @entity17 last september			1
@entity0 expects more improvement from his team after @entity1 beat @entity7 3 - 1 @entity9 ( second left ) celebrates his goal for @entity1 against @entity7 the win lifted @entity23 's team to within five points of second - place @entity25 and also went some way to appeasing the fans who watched their team play out an uninspiring 0 - 0 draw at @entity31 last week			1
but @entity23 reminded his players following the win that the season is far from over			1
' no , because ( only ) at the end of the league matches we divide the titles and not at this moment , ' the @entity1 boss said when asked if he could sense @entity4 qualification was getting closer for his men			1
@entity1 have a winnable set of fixtures coming up against @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity47			1
but @entity23 is aware he still has to travel to @entity48 and @entity49 in the last third of the season and he believes the fight for a top - four finish will go right down to the wire			2
' it shall be a big battle to the end , ' @entity23 told mutv			2
' that is a big battle			2
@entity43 has lost ( to @entity48 on saturday )			2
' one competitor shall lose			0
' @entity11 celebrates scoring his fourth goal for the club against @entity7 on saturday @entity23 ( right ) shakes hands with @entity7 's @entity64 ( left ) after the game at @entity8 @entity66 candidly admitted on monday that he had under - performed this season			1
but he looked like his old self for long periods on saturday and his goal was out of the top drawer			2
@entity66 watched @entity73 's pass float over his left shoulder before he stabbed the ball past @entity77 first time with his right boot			0
replays showed the striker was lucky the goal was allowed to stand , though , as he was marginally offside			0
@entity23 felt for his opposite number @entity83 , and admitted such errors will only be stopped if more technology is introduced into the game			0
' i think also it was offside but it always happens in games that the referee or a linesman are not in a good shape at that moment but you can not avoid that , ' @entity23 said			0
' you need modern techniques always and when you do n't use them in this modern time it shall happen every game			0
' while @entity1 have @entity7 in their sights , it is a completely different story for @entity7 , who remain rooted to the foot of the @entity107			1
@entity66 's ( right ) goal was spectacular but there were suspicions of offside @entity111 ( left ) is hopeful that @entity7 will still be able to avoid relegation from the @entity107 the foxes are three points from safety but defender @entity111 is still confident his team will not be relegated			2
' the @entity1 game was a bonus game , no one was expecting us to take anything from it , ' said @entity111 , who left @entity1 for @entity7 three years ago			1
' but our confidence is still high			0
' i think we can get out of it			0
you just have to look at the last five performances			0
we have had three wins out of them so we know we can give teams a good game			0
' we still have everyone to play around us and those are the important games			0
