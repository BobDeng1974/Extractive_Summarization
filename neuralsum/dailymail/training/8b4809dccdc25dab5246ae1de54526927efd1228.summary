@entity1 's hopes of winning the referendum on @entity4 independence have been dealt a blow by a new poll showing a slump in support for his cause among teenagers			1
the @entity13 first minister has been demanding that the 2014 vote should be extended to 16 and 17 - year - olds – encouraged by research suggesting that younger age groups were more likely to be in favour of devolution			2
however , a survey by @entity21 in @entity4 found that the teens questioned – who will be 16 or 17 in 2014 – are overwhelmingly in favour of keeping the @entity24			1
' slump ' : lack of support for devolution among teens will be a disappointment to first minister @entity1 , seen at a pro-independence rally in @entity31 according to the poll , only 26 per cent of them would back independence – even fewer than the 27 per cent rating recorded among adults in another recent survey by this newspaper			1
the @entity13 has long viewed young voters as a crucial part of its strategy to overturn decades - old resistance to independence from the majority of @entity4 voters			1
@entity4 secretary @entity46 will tomorrow hold talks with the @entity13 about plans for the referendum			2
until now , the government has been resistant to lowering the voting age – but the poll findings could persuade them to adopt a more flexible approach			0
polling expert professor @entity54 said : ‘ this shows the assumptions made by some that younger voters tend towards independence is some way out			0
‘ the crucial group are those over the age of 60 , who are more inclined to vote			0
we may yet see a deal which extends the franchise for the referendum but we do n’t know if the people in this category will turn up and vote , as turnout among younger voters is traditionally low			0
’ an @entity13 spokesman said : ‘ the @entity13 will engage positively with our young people ahead of the referendum as we have a positive message to communicate			0
