perhaps @entity0 was simply saving itself for monday ’s annual general meeting			2
at the close of another tumultuous week in the club ’s recent , crazed history there was scarcely a supporters ’ stir by way of a reaction as they watched another low - grade home victory			0
there was no show of support for @entity15 , in spite of their manager going through another week of emotional torment in which he moved closer to breaking ties with his club and learned of ex-colleague @entity23 working behind his back			1
@entity26 striker @entity25 ( centre ) rifled his side ahead after 10 minutes against @entity29 @entity30 celebrates with his @entity26 team - mates following putting his side in front @entity26 : @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity30 , @entity39 ( @entity40 81 ' ) , @entity41 , @entity42 ( @entity43 73 ' ) , @entity44 ( @entity45 ' ) , @entity38			1
subs not used : @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 goals : @entity30 10 ' @entity52 ( o.g ) 74 ' @entity29 : @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 ( @entity56 82 ' ) , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 ( @entity62 83 ' ) , @entity63 , @entity64 ( @entity65 ' ) , @entity66			1
subs not used : @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71			0
referee : @entity73 attendance : 28,053 there was barely a ripple of a retort to the boardroom that has been undermining their @entity26 hero			1
and there , of course , was very little to shout about as a strike from @entity83 and a @entity57 own goal contributed to a routine @entity86 success			1
sadly , it is apathy and acceptance that has greeted the realisation that @entity15 ’s time is ticking down at @entity26			1
even anger seems thin on the ground where once match days could be an ideal avenue for protest			0
a quiet acquiescence now says that @entity15 wo n’t be the man to lead the team much further and the stance from the fans as to who they really want removed from positions of power at @entity0 came only from a vocal pocket at the foot of the @entity108			1
they warmed up the first - half action with some anti-boardroom chants , specifically aimed at @entity112 and @entity113			2
and ‘ you greedy b * * * * * * * , get out of our club ’ came the cry in a muted flurry of fury towards the directors ’ box			0
it was claimed that 28,053 were present yet chairman @entity124 , as he did a fortnight ago , may be required to offer an adjusted total to accurately reflect the dwindling nature of the @entity0 audience			0
@entity15 , who continued to invite his players to raise their game against the unobtrusive backdrop by being a visible presence in his technical area throughout , suggested it could be a while before the disaffected fans flock back to the stadium in old numbers after taking too many slaps in the face from @entity26 regimes			1
@entity15 said : ‘ i am not sure attendances are a worry			1
obviously , when we are playing at home , i would far rather the team was being supported by 50,000 rather than 15,000 , 20,000 or 25,000			0
‘ however , i do understand , 100 per cent , the vast majority of fans ’ feelings over the last three years			0
i have felt unbelievably sorry for the fans			0
i think the club will get the fans back			0
but in the short term ? i do n’t know about that			0
’ @entity29 captain @entity57 ( left ) then scored a late own goal to make it 2 - 0 @entity26 boss @entity15 looked in high spirits despite recent difficulties at @entity0 on what may turn out to be his @entity0 dugout farewell , @entity15 went for a selection first against a @entity29 side that parted with their manager @entity163 last week			1
@entity38 and @entity44 were paired in attack as @entity48 joined @entity166 on the bench			0
the players , perhaps still shellshocked by the leaking of @entity15 ’s resignation news , were dreadfully slow starters in their last outing at @entity172			1
and they survived an early scare here before seizing a 10th - minute advantage			0
for @entity176 ’s caretaker reign would have started in spectacular fashion were it not for the excellence of @entity33			0
the keeper produced a brilliant lefthanded block , smartly getting down to push away @entity61 ’s drive			0
@entity26 were far from fluent in their efforts to build up a lead on the @entity86 ’s bottom club and had to settle for one goal before the break			1
from a @entity42 corner not adequately cleared , the ball dropped to the right foot of @entity30 and he drilled a fine finish back across goal and into the bottom right - hand corner of @entity53 ’s net			2
@entity39 ruffled the side netting but @entity29 ’s defence could hardly have been described as under siege			1
it took a superb overhead kick from @entity200 to split the sides in the season ’s earlier meeting but , with the midfield ace out injured , there was no hint of such quality invention here			0
with the home side mustering their own motivation without a well of support from the stands , @entity29 dug in to stay in the contest			1
had @entity66 fared better with a header from eight yards , the focus of @entity0 upset would have swivel led back on to the performance of @entity15 ’s players			1
@entity26 fans hold up a banner saying ' enough is enough ' at @entity0 on saturday @entity26 ' @entity37 ( right ) vies for possession with @entity29 's @entity60 he was locked in conversation with assistant @entity223 for long spells of the second half in a bid to figure out a lock - breaking move			1
those chats could n’t help @entity41 conjure a second goal to warm the blood of the loyal souls suffering at the struggles of their side			2
the midfielder was under pressure from @entity54 but should have produced better than a failure to hit the target from 12 yards after @entity30 ’s cutback			0
all those dugout discussions did add up to a call for flair and a finisher from the bench , so @entity15 introduced @entity43 and @entity166 with 17 minutes left			1
however , it was a malfunction rather than magic that held the key to breaking down @entity29 for a second time			2
@entity30 ’s delivery from the right was a teaser but it came down to a communication disconnect between @entity52 and his keeper aiding @entity26 to confirm victory			2
the visiting skipper intervened as @entity53 flew out to collect and nodded the ball into an empty net			0
substitute @entity40 was the unlikely last line of defence to stop @entity60 dragging the visitors back into the game and @entity26 ’ relief was soon complete			2
not that it was obvious to feel on a numb afternoon in @entity265			0
half - time advertising had boasted of a second - half season tickets being available for £ 125			2
it ’s going to take more than a few discount labels on that figure — preferably without sports direct branding — to tempt the bravest @entity26 souls into taking up that offer .			2

@entity83 opens the scoring for @entity26 after 10 minutes
@entity29 's @entity57 with an own goal late in the second half
@entity15 's side now nine points off of league leaders @entity280
