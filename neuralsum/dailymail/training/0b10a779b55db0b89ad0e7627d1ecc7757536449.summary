worker ants can process information far more efficiently than @entity2 , a new study claims			1
the researchers found that while an individual ant that is hunting for food walks a random path , their collective foraging behaviour transforms from chaos into order			1
together , they can process information efficiently to secure ample food to allow a colony to thrive			1
chaotic ? a new study claims that the while an individual ant hunting for food ( pictured in this scanning electron micrograph ) walks in a random way , their collective foraging behaviour changes this chaos to order and makes the more efficient than @entity2 , experts claim @entity20 ants work together to fire smelly acid into the air to ward off predators			1
the group attack using formic acid to protect a nest is enough to scare off woodpeckers and jay birds			0
fire ants bind together to build a life raft in order to survive floods			0
they use their claws and mandibles to grip each other and link together in a similar way to how waterproof fabric is woven			0
an individual ant ’s exoskeleton is moderately hydrophobic so it can shrug off water , but the ants enhance their water repellence by linking their bodies together			2
rock ants continually monitor the area near their nest in case they find a more suitable home , especially if there 's is in a state of disrepair			0
lead researcher @entity52 from @entity53 said : ‘ this strategy of adjusting their information gathering according to their actual needs and the real value of higher rungs on the property ladder may help ants to evaluate their housing market in a measured and thorough way that puts many of us to shame			2
’ @entity66 has send 800 common ants to live on the @entity68 to teach scientists how they move in low gravity			0
it is hoped that the eight colonies will give experts new ideas of how to build robots that interact with each other			0
last week , a study from the @entity78 revealed that ants ' skills at building stable underground tunnels in , loose sand could help engineers design the next generation of rescue robots			0
they used cameras to monitor the way fire ants use their antennae as extra limbs to stop themselves from falling			0
the mathematical study found that the creatures are capable of using problem - solving strategies and the move from chaos to order happens in a surprisingly efficient , self - organised way			1
understanding the ants could help experts analyse similar phenomena such as how humans behave when using the internet or even lead to the development of smart transport systems			0
the @entity108 - @entity107 research team expressed everything that is known about the foraging of ants in equations and algorithms and fed them into computers			1
they found that ants use intelligent navigational strategies to divide themselves into ‘ scouting ’ and ‘ gathering ’ groups when searching for food			1
while individual wandering ants might seem chaotic , they are actually leaving a trail of pheromones to allow the ‘ gathering ’ ants to shorten their journeys to food sources			1
as ants carrying food repeat the route , a ‘ self - reinforcing effect of efficiency ’ comes into play , saving the colony time and energy , according to the study published in the @entity137			1
professor @entity140 of the @entity141 told @entity142 that single ants quickly become part of an orderly line of ants crossing the woodland floor			2
he told the @entity142 : ‘ that transition between chaos and order is an important mechanism and i ’d go as far as to say that the learning strategy involved in that is more accurate and complex than a @entity2 search			0
’ better than @entity2 ? study co-author professor @entity140 said : ' these insects are , without doubt , more efficient than @entity2 in processing information about their surroundings ' ‘ these insects are , without doubt , more efficient than @entity2 in processing information about their surroundings			2
' previous studies have suggested that older ants lead dangerous scouting parties as they are the most expendable in a colony , but this new study suggests the opposite is true			1
the scientists revealed that the experience of individual ants contributes to the group ’s foraging success , so older ants have a better knowledge of a nest 's surroundings			1
the foraging of younger ants is a learning process rather than an effective contribution to scout food , according to the study			2
‘ while the single ant is certainly not smart , the collective acts in a way that i 'm tempted to call intelligent , ’ professor @entity140 said			0
‘ the ants collectively form a highly efficient complex network and this is something we find in many natural and social systems			0
’ fast food : while single ants can appear chaotic ( pictured ) , they quickly become part of an orderly line of ants crossing the woodland floor , thanks to pheromones laid down by ' scouting ' ants to ensure that workers can carry food as efficiently as possible			2

individual ants hunt for food in a random way , but collectively the creatures process information effectively to turn chaos into order
mathematicians from the @entity141 used equations and algorithms to study ants ' behaviour
they study , also by the @entity216 , found the ants divide themselves into ' gathering ' and ' scouting ' groups
scouting ants leave a trail of pheromones to food so that the workers ' route *gradually* becomes more efficient to save their energy and time
the experience of individual ants contributes to the group ’s foraging success , so older ants have a better knowledge of nests surroundings
research could be used to understand *online* human behaviour
