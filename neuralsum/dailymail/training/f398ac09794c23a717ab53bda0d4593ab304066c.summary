a 15 - year - old schoolboy has created one of the world 's top apps in just a couple of hours - while he was bored in a class			1
@entity6 , from @entity8 ’s east , created the app ' @entity10 ' while he was bored in a year 9 science class , with the help of an @entity14 teenager he met through @entity15			1
the app is quickly climbing the charts in the @entity14 , @entity18 and @entity19 , and has been downloaded more than 300,000 in the six weeks since it launched			1
‘ @entity21 , we ’re number three ! ’ @entity6 said during his interview with @entity24			1
‘ sorry , i just refreshed and we ’ve climbed up third on the @entity25			1
‘ we ’re ahead of @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 : all the big players ! ‘ the only apps ahead of us are @entity15 and @entity15 messenger - they ’re next ! ’ quips the ambitious teen			1
the app was created by the two teenagers in august , and in six weeks has climbed to number three on the @entity42 @entity6 is an incredibly bright student at @entity43 in @entity44 , but confesses : ‘ i ’m currently not going too good at school , but i believe my app development career is more important right now			1
’ in august , @entity6 was distracted during class when he contacted a friend , 15 - year old @entity49 schoolboy @entity48 , who he met through @entity15 group ‘ @entity51			1
’ ‘ i was a little bored so i opened by laptop and i messaged @entity53 in @entity14			1
‘ i asked him , “ do you want to quickly just make a little game or something ? ” ‘ he said “ yeah of course ’ and the game came out of nowhere , i just designed it in @entity60			0
” ’ @entity6 sent his version to @entity53 and an hour later , @entity53 sent him the prototype , which had been designed using xcode , a program used to design @entity68 apps			2
‘ it was really fun so we decided to launch it			2
’ @entity6 is excited about his new project , app ' one ' which allows users to use @entity15 , @entity75 and @entity27 on the one sleek app ‘ i realised i was onto something after seeing people playing our trial app and the fact that we have the best marketing an app could have			1
’ the marketing came when they contacted @entity86 - based social media marketer @entity84 , who they sold the app to for $ 200			2
‘ i had no problem giving @entity84 the app due to the fact i made it for fun and had no intentions to launch it , ' said @entity6			1
‘ marketing is everything , most developers do n’t even consider the concept of marketing their work			2
’ the entrepreneur is now on the brink of launching his new app , ‘ one ’ which will allow users to combine @entity15 , @entity75 and @entity27			1
it has taken months of work			2
‘ impossible @entity106 was the first game i have made			1
it does n’t represent my work - just a bit of fun			1
' ‘ one ’ is my primary focus			0
i am extremely passionate about the concept and the problem i am solving			0
' @entity6 tells @entity24 : ' ‘ i love what i do so it is n’t stressful			1
what is stressful is juggling it with school			0
' although @entity6 is entertaining designing his own platforms and hardware , he is 100 per cent committed to his new business model			2
‘ i will not stop app development til ‘ one ’ is number one on the @entity25			1
they might not last in 10 years but the concept of downloading a developer ’s project without having to buy it physically will remain for a while			0
’ it all started for @entity6 when he was eight , he started to play the @entity136 online children ’s game , @entity137			2
‘ with @entity137 , i tried to push boundaries			0
i ’d find hacks to get more coins for the game , ’ @entity6 tells @entity24			2
as ‘ @entity10 ’ has gained popularity , @entity6 has been inundated with exciting new offers			1
‘ i ’ve had multiple job offers and been asked to motivate students studying @entity147 development at universities , ' said @entity6			1
‘ ‘ i was offered a few part time and a few full - time jobs but i ’m currently not really planning on getting a job , i ’m focussing on my own project			2
@entity6 has quickly gained international attention for his incredible innovations at such a young age ‘ if i spoke at the universities i ’d tell them : “ the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones that do			1
” ‘ the success has been extremely encouraging			0
people once doubted me based purely on statistics			0
’ @entity6 is also committed to finishing school and going to university			0
the app is taking up a lot of @entity6 ’s time – but his passion for the project means he has been more than willing to devote months of his life to it			1
‘ i love what i do so it is n’t stressful			0
what is stressful is juggling it with school			0
‘ in my free time i work on my apps , nothing else			2
' even when i ’m walking and talking with friends , i ’m always thinking about the app in the back of the head			0
@entity6 says that although he spends every possible moment on his app , he makes time to have fun like any other @entity19 boy			1
‘ most people in this field are considered nerds but for me , i ’m still like a normal teenager - i go see a movie , go to the beach , food , those kinds of things according to @entity6 , he is in quite a bit of trouble with his school for putting his app first and schoolwork second ! ‘ i ignore projects and work on my app. a lot of the time i do n’t finish it off until 2 in the morning ‘ so i get in trouble at school a lot but i have good intentions ! but they 're nice about it			1
’ @entity6 first found notoriety with his @entity213 channel , uploading videos of @entity216 product reviews – including a montage of when @entity6 was the first person in @entity8 to get his hands on the new @entity219			1
‘ i ’d love to work for myself in the future but if i had to work for any company , it ’d definitely be @entity216			0
’ @entity6 believes being a teenager gives him an edge as an entrepreneur			2
‘ me being the young , the main target of apps , gives me an idea of what people want			0
this has been a great advantage			0
‘ no one in my team ( developing ‘ one ’ ) is over the age of 22			0
i think younger people get the concept better			0
’ @entity6 turns to the @entity15 group where it all began , high school hackers , for support			1
of his super successful app , @entity6 says , ' impossible @entity106 was the first game i have made			1
it does n’t represent my work - just a bit of fun ' ‘ i did n’t learn this at school , i have purely encouraged myself , i found an interest in this and pursued it			1
‘ communities like @entity253 are really encouraging			0
it ’s nice to see people with similar interest to me			0
’ ‘ the @entity15 group is really cool			2
if i ever have a problem , i can post in one group and then instantly 2000 people who do the same thing as i do see it and can make suggestions			0
a priority for @entity6 is focussing on what will be liked by the masses , which means a sleek look and universal appeal			0
when it comes to one , he is a perfectionist			0
‘ when i look at technology i think how can i make it cool			0
we need to make it pretty , beautiful – that ’s the marketing side i guess			0
’ @entity6 says seeing the app being played by strangers is the most exciting aspect of the experience			2
‘ it ’s so cool			0
on any bus , any bus station … i can see people playing everywhere i go ' it ’s exciting , like my visions have happened			0
' the new app will be launched in the next one to two months .			0
