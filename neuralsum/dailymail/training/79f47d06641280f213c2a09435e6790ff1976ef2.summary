lifesaver : @entity0 is pictured with his little sister @entity2 who suffers with apnoea , a condition which stops her breathing suddenly and without any warning			1
he learned the technique at @entity23 @entity0 has performed mouth - to - mouth resuscitation on her while watching tv , during visits to the supermarket and on family days out			1
@entity30 says she has ' no doubt ' her little daughter would have died had it not been for her big brother			0
@entity0 first came to the rescue when the family were watching television and @entity2 cried out before turning blue and falling unconscious			1
@entity30 , 37 , said : ' it all happened so fast and we were just thinking ‘ oh my god , what ’s happening			0
’ ' she just turned blue , then purple , and she was unconscious			0
but @entity0 was so cool and calm			1
he just tapped her leg and called her name and when he got no response he just gave her two breaths and she came round and took an enormous breath			0
' we could n’t believe what we had just seen			0
' @entity0 has performed mouth - to - mouth resuscitation on his sister while watching tv , on family days out and even during visits to the supermarket @entity2 weighed just 2lbs when she was born at just 28 weeks and was in hospital for 10 weeks before she was able to come home , weighing just 5lbs			1
she used to stop breathing a couple of times a week but now has an episode around once a month , although doctors say she will eventually grow out of the condition			1
apnoea of prematurity is the absence of spontaneous respiration			2
it tends to occur in premature babies and occurs because the baby ’s central nervous system is not fully developed when they are born			2
most babies can be roused from an apnoea episode simply by tapping or rubbing them to make them more alert , and most grow out of the condition as their body grows and develops			1
although apnoea usually resolves itself by the time most premature babies go home , a few will continue to have episodes			2
in these cases , the baby will be discharged from the intensive care with an apnoea monitor			2
the child may also need to take caffeine medication for a short time			0

' before i knew it he had her up out of the trolley , he had to squat down on his knees and held her across his knees giving her breaths			0
