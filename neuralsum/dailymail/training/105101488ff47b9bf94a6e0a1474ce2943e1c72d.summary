by @entity0 published : 03:18 est , 27 march 2012 updated : 14:51 est , 27 march 2012 a giant explosive cloud hanging over a @entity4 rig could take six months to clear and may expand towards the @entity6 coast , it was warned today			1
the huge underwater reservoir tapped by oil giant @entity10 's @entity9 platform , which sits 150 miles from @entity11 , is known as the ' well from hell ' because it is so difficult to plug			1
an exclusion zone stretching up to four miles has been set up around the platform because it could explode			1
the exact source of the leak is still a mystery but it is escaping out of the platform , which has pumped gas and oil to @entity21 for the past decade			1
@entity10 say they are considering a drilling relief well to divert the gas , which would be a safe way to end the crisis , but it could take up to six months			1
the faster and riskier alternative of sending engineers onto the rig to ' kill ' the leak is also on the table , but it would mean having workers at the centre of a potential disaster zone			1
danger : a leak from the @entity9 rig , pictured , has led to more than 300 workers being evacuated from that and surrounding oil and gas platforms total boss @entity42 said : ' the well itself could die on its own			1
this is the dream option			0
' there are two options for intervening			0
one is drilling a relief well which could take about six months			2
the other is a platform intervention to kill the well			2
' in the last two days hundreds of workers have also been evacuated off or away from the @entity10 platform , which stands 150 miles from the @entity11 coast			1
coastguards have today demanded shipping stays at least two miles away , planes must keep a distance of three miles , while rigs up to four miles away are being emptied in case they get caught up in any explosion			2
' this is the well from hell , ' said @entity66 , head of @entity67 , a leading @entity69 group that closely monitors the oil industry			0
' this problem is out of control and is only going to get bigger and bigger , ' he added , saying the high pressure of the undersea reservoirs in the @entity4 field made it especially hard to shut off			1
it is also being reported the team of @entity79 ' hellfighters ' who battled the @entity82 disaster in april 2010 , which killed 11 and injured 16 , is being brought to @entity6 by @entity10 to prevent or tackle a blast			1
the incident in the @entity86 shocked the world and cost oil giant @entity89 almost £ 5 billion in reparations , and anything on that scale would be unprecedented in @entity21			2
fears have risen because the total rig is now surrounded by a giant gas cloud , with a sheen of liquid gas on the water - a tell - tale sign there is a large leak			1
@entity10 's shares dived about five percent today as it scrambled to present a strategy to deal with the leak			1
@entity42 , health , safety and environment manager for the company , told the @entity111 programme that there are risks around the situation			0
he said : ' the gas is flammable but the platform power was turned off to minimise risk of ignition , but clearly there is a risk			2
' we have taken away a series of risks but there is always a possibility , it 's low but you never say never			0
' the best - case scenario is that the gas in this area is not very productive and it dies off in the coming days and weeks			0
' at the moment there is no real evolution of the sheen on the sea but if that was to change - and it 's monitored on a daily basis - then the exclusion zone may be increased , but at the moment it will probably stay the same			1
' @entity21 officials said the gas , containing poisonous hydrogen sulphide - familiar from the smell of rotten eggs - should disperse in the atmosphere			0
but it poses a risk to anyone close to the source , making capping the well complex			0
poison in the gas could also threaten fish and other marine life nearby , although the rate at which it dissipates in air and water meant it was not a significant threat to people on land			0
on sunday all 238 staff were evacuated from the @entity9 platform			0
@entity163 has now removed 85 workers from its @entity166 platform and the nearby @entity168 drilling rig while the nearby leak is found and stopped , taking the total evacuated from the area to 323			1
drilling operations on its @entity168 rig have been suspended and the wells have been left in a safe state , @entity163 said			2
close - up : it is being reported that the total rig , pictured , has a large gas cloud surrounding it and has left a condensed gas slick on the water ' while the move is purely precautionary and primarily driven by the prevailing weather conditions , and both facilities remain operational , it has been decided to reduce numbers to a more manageable level until the full situation surrounding the @entity9 leak has been established , ' a @entity163 spokesman added			1
they are removing 52 workers from @entity166 , leaving 38 on board , while 33 are being taken off the @entity194 , leaving 79			0
evidence of the leak is believed to have emerged a few hours after staff had completed the closure of a well on sunday			0
but pressure began building up in the outer layers of the well , which led to bubbling on the surface of the sea			0
danger : a team of workers who helped tackle the @entity82 disaster , pictured , off the coast of @entity210 has been flown in to cap the leak disaster : the @entity82 explosion killed and injured dozens , which is why hundreds have been evacuated from the @entity9 platform and an exclusion zone set up @entity10 says it still does not know the cause of the leak and is taking ' all possible measures ' to bring it under control			1
but oil insiders say the gas leak on the @entity9 platform is a ‘ major , major problem ’ and it is feared it could be coming directly from the reservoir and would be difficult to stop			2
investigators from @entity228 ( @entity229 ) yesterday carried out two aerial surveillance flights to assess the situation and two further flights are planned today			0
there have been no reports of any injuries			0
@entity236 : a boat works to collect oil that has come from the @entity82 wellhead , a disaster that cost @entity89 £ 5 billion @entity10 said it yesterday met the secretary of state ’s representative , the @entity245 , the @entity244 , @entity246 and the coastguard to discuss the problem			1
the company said it has also mobilised experts from elsewhere in the @entity251 to offer additional assistance and help deal with the incident			0
' @entity256 @entity21 confirms that the gas leak at the @entity258 remains ongoing , although the situation is currently stable , ' a spokesman said			0
' we continue to take all possible measures to try to identify the source and cause of the leak and to bring it under control			0
' the leak on the total platform comes after chancellor @entity269 expressed his support for gas as a cheap and relatively clean fuel that would remain important for @entity21 supplies , with measures to support new gas power stations			2
he also announced £ 3 billion in tax breaks for deep water oil and gas exploration to the west of @entity279			0
@entity281 energy campaigner @entity282 said : ' leaks like this make @entity269 's dash for gas even more absurd - it could be months before it 's sorted , posing a huge safety risk to workers and releasing a greenhouse gas 20 times more climate - wrecking than carbon dioxide			1
' gas is already pushing our fuel bills through the roof - now people will be wondering whether they 'll be asked to cover the cost of the leak			2
' it 's time we shifted to clean and safe @entity21 energy from the wind , sun and sea - this , and slashing energy waste , is our best hope for affordable power			2

a four - mile exclusion zone has been set up around the @entity10 platform
@entity79 ' hellfighters ' who tackled the @entity82 disaster have reportedly been called in
@entity163 has also pulled out workers from nearby rigs
the leak could take six months to fix because of the huge pressure produced by the well below the @entity4
@entity10 's share price drops by 5 *%* as they scramble to solve the crisis
