for a recipient who likes gobbling and imbibing , a @entity0 hamper is always a reliably strong gift			0
but most of us giving such a chest of treats would likely fill it with a couple of bottles of plonk , a wedge of brie , a jar of pickled something - or - other and a kicky little chocolate selection box			2
few of us would stretch to the @entity16 , a treasure trove of 59 goodies - including 25 bottles of wine and spirits , gold leaf marmalade , @entity24 caviar and truffled foie gras - that will set the buyer back a cool £ 20,000			1
the @entity28 hamper will cost you £ 20,000 , but it does include truffled caviar , a salmon fillet , plenty of cheese and a box of crackers costing £ 599 each the enormous collection has been pieced together by @entity16 food experts , and is sure to delight the tastebuds of any one who could afford the hefty price tag			1
as well as the bundle of pricely gourmet goodies , the recipient of this gift , will have @entity0 made easy , as it includes a @entity0 cake , cheese boards , table decorations and a box of six @entity51 @entity0 crackers which individually have a £ 599 price tag			0
the six - all painstakingly constructed - look slightly more extra special than your average cracker and include no bad jokes and silly paper hats			0
instead they are filled with jewellery , leather wallets and fountain pens			0
instead of terrible jokes and paper hats , @entity0 crackers contain leather wallets , jewellery and fountain pens along with 25 bottles of wines and spirits - including a 2004 magnum of @entity70 and a @entity72 thirty @entity71 - the hamper includes two tea and coffee treats , 18 pantry items , six fresh produce treats and five kitchen gifts , two of which are a set of cheese knives and a glass table dome to cover the cheese board with			1
other hampers , for those on a more diminutive budget , are also available from the department store , with the opulence hamper cashing in at £ 10,000 and the @entity89 at a meagre £ 2,500			2
the £ 10,000 opulence hamper contains 17 bottles of wine and spirits , plenty of cheese and crackers , @entity97 and @entity99 chorizo other hampers from @entity16 are moderately less lavish ... but only moderately @entity16 ' own - brand hampers are much more economically viable from @entity102			1

the 59 - piece @entity104 includes 25 bottles of wine and spirits
fill your *fridge* with @entity113 *rounds* , salmon fillets and @entity24 caviar
also inside the treasure chest is a cheese knife set and a glass table dome
more modest @entity16 hamper options include £ 10,000 opulence hamper
