residents can now nominate a neighbour to receive their parcels so they never miss a delivery , @entity0 announced yesterday			1
the move could reduce the number of ‘ red cards ’ which land on doormats to tell householders a package has been returned to the delivery office			1
postmen already attempt to deliver parcels to people ’s neighbours if they are out			1
but the new service means they can now deliver to a specific friend who lives nearby , in the recipient ’s absence			1
residents can now nominate a neighbour to receive their parcels so they never miss a delivery , @entity0 announced yesterday ( file picture ) it means people can choose a neighbour who they know well , or who is often in during the day , to sign for a parcel or receive a delivery which will not fit through the letter box			1
the price of first and second class stamps rose by a penny each yesterday			0
a first class stamp now costs 63p while second class is 54p – more than double what it was ten years ago			0
sending a large letter has gone up by 2p to 95p for first class and by 1p to 74p for second class			0
@entity0 , which was privatised in 2013 , said it had ‘ thought carefully about the impact on customers ’ because of ‘ recent tough economic conditions ’			2
however critics fear the increase will hit small businesses which depend on the postal service			0
the price rise is 1.6 per cent for a first class stamp , and 1.9 per cent for second class			0
@entity52 , of the @entity53 , said : ‘ if you ’re a business that relies heavily on the postal service , increases in prices wo n’t be welcomed			0
‘ businesses affected will have to decide whether to absorb it or pass it on to their customers			0
’ @entity0 said the ‘ nominate a @entity64 ’ scheme would be more convenient for householders and ‘ improve first - time delivery ’			1
@entity67 , of @entity0 , said : ‘ this new initiative is great news for our customers as it offers further choice and convenience if there is no one at home			2
‘ for our postmen and women it means that they are even more likely to deliver parcels and letters first time rather than having to take items back to the office			1
first - time delivery of parcels and signed - for items is high in @entity0 and in the trial delivery offices this improved further			1
’ since 2012 @entity0 has left parcels with neighbours if the recipient is not in			1
but critics feared this meant valuable packages could be left with untrustworthy or unfamiliar neighbours			0
now customers can nominate a preferred neighbour by visiting their local delivery office , filling out a short form and presenting proof of their identity			0
postmen will try to deliver to this neighbour in the first instance , before trying other addresses nearby			2
it is unclear if using the nominate service , however , will mean that households are now responsible if their parcel then goes missing			0
under the old system , when postmen knocked on several neighbours ’ doors , @entity0 was still responsible if the parcel later went astray			2
special delivery items and international parcels requiring a signature are excluded from the scheme .			2

postmen can now deliver to a specific friends who lives nearby to recipient
move could see the number of parcels returned to delivery offices fall
@entity0 said the scheme would be more convenient for householders
