dr @entity1 was diagnosed with the deadly virus on november 10 and arrived in @entity10 for care on saturday , where doctors described the 44 - year - old as ' extremely ill ' and in perhaps worse condition than any other @entity2 patient treated in the @entity8 by sunday the @entity3 native 's condition had deteriorated to extremely critical			1
he died early monday morning , around 4am			0
' it is with an extremely heavy heart that we share this news , ' said dr @entity23 , medical director of the @entity24 at @entity25 , said in a statement monday morning			0
' dr @entity1 was extremely critical when he arrived here , and unfortunately , despite our best efforts , we were n't able to save him			1
' dr @entity1 had advanced symptoms of the virus when he arrived , doctors said , including kidney and respiratory failure			1
they desperately tried to save him by placing him on dialysis , a ventilator and giving him several medications to support his organs			0
he also received a blood transfusion from an @entity2 survivor and a dose of the experimental serum @entity44			0
' we used every possible treatment available to give dr @entity1 every possible opportunity for survival , ' said dr @entity23			1
' as we have learned , early treatment with these patients is essential			0
in dr @entity1 's case , his disease was already extremely advanced by the time he came here for treatment			1
' dr @entity1 was born in @entity3 but was a permanent resident of the @entity8 and lived in @entity58 , @entity59 with his wife and children			1
he would spend about four months at a time working overseas			0
the @entity62 helped facilitate the transfer of dr @entity1			1
the @entity8 @entity64 in @entity65 said his wife planned to reimburse them for the cost of the private medevac flight , which has not yet been calculated			2
the travel costs and care of other @entity2 patients flown to the @entity8 have been covered by the groups they worked for in @entity75			1
the center previously cured two other patients of the deadly virus , currently sweeping through @entity75 family : dr @entity1 ( second right ) is survived by his wife @entity86 ( second left ) and two sons			1
the surgeon was born in @entity3 , but was a permanent resident of the @entity8 who lived in @entity58 , @entity59 with his family when he was n't working overseas @entity2 has killed more than 5,000 people in @entity75 this year , mostly in @entity92 , @entity93 and @entity94			1
of the 10 people treated for the virus in the @entity8 , all but one has recovered			2
dr @entity1 's death is even more tragic considering he went nearly a week , believing he was @entity2 - free			1
the doctor started showing symptoms of the virus on november 6 , but his initial test came up negative			1
however , @entity102 officials say some doctors are unaware that @entity2 tests can be inconclusive in the first three days the virus is in the system			2
now the three people who hugged dr @entity1 after hearing news of the negative test result are in quarantine , over fears they may have been infected			1
so far none are symptomatic			0
if the test says you are @entity2 - free , we assume you are @entity2 - free , ' said @entity115 , who cared for @entity1 at the @entity116 in @entity65 , told the @entity117			2
' then everything fell apart			0
' after receiving his @entity2 test results , dr @entity1 was released from the ebola treatment ward but remained feverish and weak			1
for the next five days , his symptoms worsened to the point he started vomiting uncontrollably and suffered a high fever and diarrhea			0
he was prescribed malaria medication but his condition did not improve			0
eventually he called colleague @entity127 at the hospital where they both worked , expressing fears that he might still have @entity2 ' in spite of what the test said '			2
on november 10 , dr @entity1 took another test and this time he tested positive			1
it 's still unclear how dr @entity1 contracted the virus , since his hospital did not treat @entity2 patients			1
doctors there say they work with the understanding that any of their patients could be infected , which leaves them at high - risk of catching the disease since they normally only wear gloves as protection			0
since the star of this year 's outbreak , 320 health care workers in @entity3 have died of the disease			2
the faces of some doctors have been plastered on billboards across @entity65 with he words ' some of our national heroes killed by @entity2 '			0

' we are very , very sorry the outcome is not the one we all wished for			0

there is no known cure for @entity2 , one of the deadliest known pathogens , but trials for several possible treatments were announced this week in @entity75 and @entity266			2
the disease is spread through contact with bodily fluids			0
dr @entity1 received his surgical training from a group called the @entity272 , which seeks to train @entity75 doctors on a level comparable to training they would receive in the @entity8 , said @entity276 , of @entity277 , @entity278 , a fellow medical missionary			1

' i knew it was n’t going to be rosy , but why did i decide to choose this job ? i firmly believe @entity300 wanted me to do it			0
and i knew deep within myself			0
there was just something inside of me that the people of this part of @entity65 needed help , ' he said			0
' i see it as @entity300 ’s own desired framework for me , ' dr @entity1 added			2
' i took this job not because i want to , but i firmly believe that it was a calling and that @entity300 wanted me to			0
that ’s why i strongly believe that @entity300 will have brought me here , will fix whatever comes to my door , ( my ) way			0
and i ’m pretty sure , i ’m confident that i just need to lean on him , trust him , for whatever comes in , because he sent me here			0
