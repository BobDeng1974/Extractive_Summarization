by @entity0 published : 19:04 est , 2 april 2013 updated : 19:04 est , 2 april 2013 off - screen , everyone refers to @entity3 as ‘ the boys ’			1
dressed in baseball caps and baggy trousers , rapping and dancing on their variety show @entity11 , they look more like teenagers than middle - aged men			1
they ’ve been professional ‘ cheeky chappies ’ for so long — right back to the late @entity15 when they starred in the children ’s soap @entity19 — that we ca n’t imagine them growing up			1
even though they ’re now 37 , they are eternal kids — and they know that ’s their appeal			1
but @entity26 and @entity27 were as surprised as anyone when their charity single @entity31 rocketed to the top of the charts on sunday			1
with all the profits going to @entity36 , it has been selling around 20,000 copies a day			1
number one : @entity26 and @entity27 , better known as @entity3 , show that nice guys do not finish last in show - business twenty - four hours earlier , @entity41 ’s @entity11 trounced @entity43 ’s @entity42 in the saturday - night ratings , pulling in a million more viewers at 7.2 million			1
but @entity3 are no mere tv presenters : after 25 years in showbiz , they are part of the national fabric			1
everyone knows them , even if many would never admit to watching the shows they host , which include i ’m a celebrity … @entity55 ! and @entity57 ’s @entity56			1
and so that viewers can tell them apart , they use a simple trick — ant is always on the viewer ’s left , and dec on the right			1
admittedly , not all of their series are hits — @entity70 flopped badly and @entity71 turned out to be a forgettable update of @entity73			1
attempts to break @entity75 have also failed			1
@entity26 , in particular , is unhappy that some of the successful formats the duo have launched here have transferred to the @entity80 without them			1
on top : after reaching the top of the charts this weekend , the pair tweeted ' @entity86 blummin ' g ! we 're @entity88 ' 1 ! thank u ! you 're all nuts but we love ! cheers ! @entity92 ' yet when they revived their 1994 hit @entity94 ten days ago , it was clear they were back to doing what they love most : cheering us all up with a mixture of genuine , unforced charm and precision professionalism			1
they threw themselves into the dance routine , high - stepping and body - popping , with grins on their faces and concentration in their eyes			1
what ’s fascinating is that @entity11 is hardly a trailblazing format — it ’s fairly standard family telly along on the lines of @entity116			1
the element of alchemy comes in the sheer infectious energy of @entity3 , and it ’s meant they ’ve never had to be controversial or crude to keep their act fresh			1
that ’s the essence of their appeal — they do n’t take themselves seriously			1
but they ’re utterly serious about what they do , and they share a real friendship that seems immune to the pressures of the business			2
unlike most tv personalities , they appear to understand that what they ’re doing is not deep and meaningful			2
it ’s called light entertainment for a reason , and it ’s none the worse for that			2
they recognise their limitations , too , and are never afraid to share a stage with other talents			2
in this sense , they ’re mirroring @entity151 , who are often regarded as their role models			2
@entity154 — the greatest double act in @entity157 comedy — were always happy to bring in guests such as @entity159 and @entity160 , who loaded their shows with star presence			2
@entity3 may not be quite in the same league but they do exactly the same			1
last saturday , they brought in @entity164 , @entity165 and the singer @entity166			2
the duo ’s instincts to never hog the limelight or seem as though they believe their own publicity helps us to avoid overdosing			2
unlike other stars who seem too ubiquitous — @entity174 is an obvious culprit — @entity3 know how much exposure is enough			1
old school : cheeky chappies @entity3 as @entity3 back in the days when they were ready to ' rhumble ' that helps their star to keep glittering instead of burning out			1
so does their evident love for trashy tv			2
they grew up enjoying gameshows and quizzes , and this heartfelt love of the medium and its traditions , particularly family tv , reflects their upbringing			2
both @entity3 grew up in three - bedroom council houses in @entity192			1
dec was the youngest of seven children born to an @entity196 couple , @entity195 and @entity197			2
five years younger than his nearest sibling , he was always the baby and centre of attention			2
money was tight : the four boys slept in one room , the three sisters shared another , and their parents had the third			2
dec was soon supplementing the family income by performing jokes and dance routines at the @entity212 , which his parents ran , and going around afterwards collecting tips in an ashtray			2
@entity26 had one sister , and lived opposite his mother ’s parents			2
his parents separated when he was eight , and four years later he joined the cast of @entity19 as the laddish @entity3			1
dec was already in the series , as the mischievous @entity222			0
the producers immediately saw the potential of pairing them in comic storylines			0
but they did n’t become friends until a couple of years later , when @entity26 sent dec a @entity232 card with a @entity233 : ‘ fancy going to the @entity192 - @entity236 match on @entity237 ? ’ ‘ @entity237 1990 was our first date , ’ ant jokes			0
‘ but there was n’t a magical moment where dec and me bonded and decided to spend the rest of our lives together			0
’ two years later , they launched a pop career as @entity3 , performing at under - 18s discos			1
they reached no 9 in the single charts with @entity249 and no 5 in the album charts with @entity252 but neither was a fan of their own music — dec admits he prefers @entity257 to anything recorded in the past 50 years			1
they dropped the @entity3 characters , and started presenting children ’s programmes as themselves			1
like the reality shows and variety bills they host today , the @entity264 - winning @entity263 on @entity265 appealed to all ages			0
they make the sort of telly that grandmas can watch with grandchildren			0
that gives @entity3 licence to mock other celebs , and even to put them through tortures in i ’m a celebrity			1
but they never come across as vindictive or spiteful			0
through all of this , their magic formula is to project a genuine friendship			0
they bicker but with affection ; they tease , sulk and send each other up so naturally it feels as though they are simply extending their off - screen relationship in front of the cameras			1
though both enjoy a pint , they are too experienced to develop bad habits that may risk their careers			0
they also make no secret of their need to earn money and of their nagging fear , common to most entertainers from poor backgrounds , that all their earnings might somehow vanish overnight			0
but they have resisted the temptation to cash in greedily like many contemporaries — by doing ads for loan firms or injury lawyers , for instance			0
and in 2010 , when @entity41 ’s finances were taking a battering , they accepted a reduction in salaries , rather than tout their services to the highest bidder			0
they are , in short , professionals			0
as dec once recalled : ‘ we might have been kids but we were getting paid , and there was a word for what we were doing			0
it was called a job			0
’ a major difference in their lifestyles that could have pushed them apart — ant is married while dec is single — seems to have sealed the friendship			0
when @entity26 wed his long - term girlfriend @entity331 in 2005 , dec was best man			0
dec ’s former girlfriend , tv presenter @entity333 , says : ‘ @entity331 is such a strong character and she has to be			0
she has been the person who grounds them through it all			0
dec is incredibly close to her — they are like brother and sister			0
and it ’s a lovely relationship between the three of them — it works really well			0
’ the duo ’s temperaments are different , too			0
dec is confident and gregarious			0
ant is more reserved , taking his time to size up people			0
his reticence sometimes comes across as aloofness , which can cause problems : last year , while watching football in a pub , he was punched by a yob who had been taunting him			0
the incident echoed a similar assault 20 years ago , when a man walked up to him at a bar , insulted him then hit him in the face , blackening his eye			0
despite these differences , @entity3 are inseparable — they even live within a few doors of each other in @entity370 — and in interviews they hint they ’ve taken out £ 2 million life - insurance policies because the death of one would surely end the other ’s career			1
the money would be scant compensation , of course , and not just for their rumoured £ 6 million salaries at @entity41			0
as dec puts it : ‘ ours is a career built on a friendship , not a friendship built on a career			0
’ that ca n’t be faked			0
and as long as they make us believe we can share that bond , we ’ll keep tuning in .			0
