@entity0 , newly wearing a wedding ring , can afford to smile even if some of the rituals of his long career in @entity5 will not be repeated at sunday ’s @entity7 @entity6			1
three times he has won around @entity9			2
there is little chance of that tally being added to in his temperamental @entity13			1
there is absolutely no chance of a pre-race coffee and post-race celebratory fish and chips at the @entity20 on @entity22 beach			2
@entity13 's @entity0 is gearing up for his 16th season in @entity5 @entity0 has recorded three victories in @entity26 during his career but , aged 35 , just being here is the great boon			1
a 16th season beckons after he feared being dropped last year to make way for @entity33 , the incoming double world champion from @entity35			1
but he was kept on — the result of a boardroom fight between @entity13 chairman @entity38 , who favoured @entity39 partnering @entity33 , and fellow shareholder @entity40 , who supported whichever driver @entity38 did not want			1
‘ this is where i should be , ’ said @entity0 in the paddock on thursday			1
‘ it does n’t feel like a bonus , it feels normal , — and exciting because it is such an exciting new package of engine and car			2
’ but as cruel irony would have it , @entity33 will miss this race after he banged his head in testing and @entity39 has been called up to replace him in tandem with @entity0			1
@entity0 poses with the @entity54 concept vehicle at a @entity56 press conference @entity33 ’s accident in @entity58 last month prompted a host of theories : among them that he had a fit before losing control or suffered an electric shock			1
the second theory is totally denied by the team			2
@entity0 , however , was concerned enough to examine the data of @entity33 ’s car to satisfy himself there was nothing for him to fear			1
‘ i will not get into a car unless i am 100 per cent sure that it is safe , ’ he said			2
‘ i spent hours going through the data with the engineers and talking to them about the incident			2
‘ there was nothing wrong with the car whatsoever			2
i needed to know that before getting into the car at the next test , so i made certain of it			2
‘ when you are driving at the limit , you need to be sure			0
i trust these guys and that is why i have the confidence to drive it this weekend			0
’ yes , but not as fast as @entity13 would like			1
they are nowhere near the top teams — in expected order : mercedes , by miles , @entity90 , @entity91 and @entity35			0
@entity0 , a glass - half - full sort of man , was realistic in his assessment of his team ’s prospects			1
@entity0 married his fiancee @entity97 in a secret ceremony in @entity99 in january ‘ we definitely wo n’t be fighting for a win here , ’ he said			1
‘ the important thing for us is to see improvements every race and progress			0
‘ the power unit package is so tight and so advanced that you do have issues and we have had more issues than we would have liked			0
‘ whether we score points here or not is irrelevant ; it is all about improvements race to race			0
‘ i would rather not score points here and then win a race later in the year			0
’ this prognosis is a bit dispiriting given the expectations generated by @entity13 ’s new partnership with @entity13			1
should the team ’s fortunes not turn around , questions will be asked about the success of the restructuring carried out a year ago			0
@entity128 , who it was yesterday announced will take over as chief executive of sir @entity133 ’s @entity132 challenge , was sacked as team principal			0
@entity135 was brought in to replace him and @entity38 took on a more involved role as chief executive			0
‘ we are a year behind the other manufacturers and the design is more aggressive to be a challenge to @entity88 in the future , ’ added @entity0			1
‘ @entity13 are the manufacturer who will take it to @entity88			1
there are going to be teething problems , but it is about answering those issues right now			0
’ while @entity0 brings his experience to bear , another @entity150 driver , @entity149 , is just starting out			1
the 23 - year - old @entity153 - born racer made his debut in @entity155 for @entity156 last november and the @entity7 @entity6 should be his first race for @entity158 , if they qualify by the 107 per cent rule — within seven per cent of the pole - sitting car ’s time			0
he drove well on his debut and was assured in his press briefing yesterday			0
@entity149 , whose father is a successful financial figure , comes with an estimated £ 5million of personal sponsorship to fund his ride			0
he has signed a one - year contract			0
‘ two months ago you could n’t say i would definitely be here , ’ he said of the last - minute deal that saved @entity158			0
‘ there were other options , but we held out for this			0
’ he has even less chance of scoring points than @entity0			1
‘ we need to try to be here at the end of the race to pick up the pieces , ’ he said .			0

@entity0 has recorded three victories in @entity26 during his career
the @entity13 driver was kept on for 16th season *due* to a boardroom fight
he married his fiancee @entity97 in a secret ceremony in january
