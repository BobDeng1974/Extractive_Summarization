new findings : women diagnosed with breast cancer who drank three and a half small glasses of wine a week were 10 % more likely to survive than non drinkers a glass of wine a day boosts the survival chances of women with breast cancer by up to a fifth , scientists have found			1
those who drink in moderation are more likely to recover from the illness than those who abstain			0
but the findings are somewhat unexpected because drinking alcohol is considered to be one of the leading causes of breast cancer among healthy women			2
one explanation is that the chemicals in alcohol which damage healthy cells also have the same effect on cancerous cells			0
there are currently no specific guidelines for breast cancer patients on alcohol consumption , but healthy women are advised to drink no more than 14 units a week			1
many women with cancer stop drinking in the hope it will boost the success of their treatment			0
researchers from the @entity39 looked at 13,525 women with breast cancer for an average of seven years , making it the largest study of its kind			1
they recorded the average weekly alcohol intake for each patient as well as their body mass index			0
women who drank seven units a week – three and a half small glasses of wine – were 10 per cent more likely to survive than those who had nothing			1
the odds increased to 20 per cent if women drank 14 units a week			1
dr @entity57 , of the university ’s @entity58 , said : ‘ what our study says is that it is reasonable , if you ’re diagnosed with breast cancer , to enjoy the occasional drink of alcohol			2
’ although drinking alcohol seems to make a big difference to women ’s survival odds , the scientists pointed out that the overall change was small			0
this was because there were many other factors affecting the success of treatment including how early the illness was diagnosed , the woman ’s age and the particular type of breast cancer			2
experts commenting on the study also pointed out that alcohol was only beneficial once a woman had been diagnosed with breast cancer			0
raising the odds : those who drank seven small glasses of wine a week were 20 per cent more likely survive breast cancer than those who abstained from drinking alcohol			1

@entity39 researchers looked at 13,525 women with breast cancer for an average of seven years
women who drank three and a half small glasses of wine a week were 10 % more likely to survive than those who had nothing
those who drank seven glasses a week had 20 % *higher* survival rates
