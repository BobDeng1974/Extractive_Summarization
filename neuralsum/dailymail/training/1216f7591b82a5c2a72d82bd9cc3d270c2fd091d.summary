action hero @entity0 is n’t taking any chances			1
with terror threats heating up worldwide , and today being the 13th anniversary of 9/11 , the actor made a last minute decision to cancel plans for him and his entourage to fly from @entity8 to @entity9 on a commercial flight			1
on september 11th , 2001 , the 43 - year - old @entity12 star was actually booked on the doomed @entity13 that left @entity8 ’s @entity14 and flew into the @entity15 of the @entity16 killing all 92 passengers on board			1
‘ there would have been a lot of blood in that first class cabin but a few days earlier he changed his plans and flew to @entity32 when a friend asked him to view his film at the @entity35 , sparing his life			2
at the time @entity0 was criticized for claiming that , had he been on board , things may have played out much differently			2
‘ if i was on the plane with my kids , it would n’t have went down like it did , ’ he said at the time			0
‘ there would have been a lot of blood in that first class cabin and then me saying , okay we ’re going to land somewhere safely , do n’t worry			0
’ he later issued an apology			0
‘ to speculate about such a situation is ridiculous to begin with , and to suggest i would have done anything differently than the passengers on that plane was irresponsible			2
i deeply apologize to the families of the victims that my answer came off as offensive ; it was certainly not my attention			2
’ bi-coastal : @entity0 , his co-stars and his crew have been filming @entity61 2 in @entity8 when the director decided to move the shoot to @entity9 @entity0 , his co-stars and his crew have been filming @entity61 2 in @entity8 and although they were scheduled to continue shooting on the @entity65 for another month before moving back to @entity9 , director @entity64 decided to move the shoot back to the @entity67 in order to give it a better loo			1
he even coughed up a whopping $ 10 million out of his own pocket to make that happen			0
‘ ten million is n’t really that much when you consider the original @entity61 made close to $ 300 million , ’ says a source			0
‘ that ’s why @entity0 is leaving the decision to move in @entity64 ’s hands			0
but when he found out the studio booked passage for the actors and crew on a commercial jet on 9/11 , traveling that same route – @entity8 to @entity9 - he decided to rent a private jet to help insure the group ’s safety			1
‘ @entity0 has never really gotten over the fact that if he had n’t made the last minute decision to fly to @entity32 , he would have been on board that doomed flight , ’ says the source			1
‘ and he just was n’t willing to take any chances on 9/11 of anything happening when he ’s already cheated death once			0
