by @entity0 published : 07:55 est , 9 march 2014 updated : 06:35 est , 10 march 2014 @entity3 may have acted illegally by denying expat @entity4 the right to vote in the independence referendum , a top lawyer has claimed			1
@entity7 , an expert in @entity9 law , said the rules imposed by @entity4 ’s first minister had ‘ good prospects ’ of being overturned in court			0
he believes the decision could be reversed in a judicial review on the grounds that it violated the right of @entity4 expatriates to enjoy freedom of movement under @entity23 law			1
this would add an estimated 1.15million @entity4 expats to the voting rolls and court action could delay the referendum , which is due to take place on september 18			1
legal challenge : @entity4 first minister @entity3 ( pictured with deputy first minister @entity31 ) has denied expatriates the right to vote - but this might be illegal that figure includes some 750,000 who are currently living in @entity37			1
@entity39 - born lawyer @entity38 , who is now based in @entity40 , asked mr @entity41 for his legal advice on the matter			0
if unsuccessful , mr @entity41 says a petition demanding a judicial review can be lodged within a week and fast - tracked to the @entity46 for a judgement before this september 's planned referendum			1
more than 2,700 signatures backing a legal challenge have already been collected			0
the campaign for @entity4 home rule began almost as soon as unification took place in 1707 1934 : the @entity55 was established 1998 : the @entity56 paved the way for devolution 2007 : @entity55 won their first minority government 2011 : @entity55 election victory leads to securing a mandate for a referendum 2014 : a referendum on @entity4 independence has been earmarked for september 18 among those supporting the action are former @entity4 rugby union player @entity67 , husband of presenter @entity68 and @entity69 , a former football manager for @entity4			2
both now live in @entity37			0
a judicial review could however cost as much as £ 100,000 , so donors are being sought who are willing to support the action			0
in contrast to the expatriates who are currently denied the vote , many @entity79 , @entity80 and @entity23 citizens living in @entity4 - whose citizenship would remain unaffected whatever the outcome of the referendum - are allowed to vote			2
mr @entity41 told the @entity83 that other points to consider are that while @entity4 - born @entity87 citizens have been promised @entity4 citizenship if the referendum favours independence - they may in turn lose their @entity87 citizenship			2
an independent @entity4 might also need to apply for @entity23 citizenship , meaning expatriates would for a period of time lose their rights to free healthcare , benefits and the right to work in @entity23 countries			0

first minister @entity3 has denied expatriates the right to vote
top *barrister* @entity41 claims they have a right to freedom of movement
denying their vote is illegal and there should be a judicial review
legal *documents* are being sent to @entity3 and @entity125
750,000 @entity4 expatriates live in @entity37
a judicial review could delay referendum until after september 18
