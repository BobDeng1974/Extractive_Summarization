the call went out across the land just hours after war was declared			1
‘ @entity10 need you , ’ the adverts implored , urging @entity4 to fight the oppressor in what was already being heralded as ‘ the greatest conflict in the history of the world ’			2
in their modest homes in terraced city streets , the @entity13 boys barely hesitated			2
there were ten of them back then , all aged between 18 and 37			1
two were already in military service for @entity22 forces abroad and all were willing to put their lives on the line for liberty			2
@entity26 , 18 , @entity27 @entity28 , 27 , 9th @entity29 @entity30 , 22 , @entity31 @entity32 , 21 , @entity33 so in the space of those chaotic few weeks in august and september 1914 , as the nation prepared for war against the @entity38 , all ten would answer the call to fight in the trenches of @entity41 and @entity42 or defend the nation at sea			1
and , incredibly , all appear to have come home alive			0
a century on , the @entity46 are being hailed as the biggest band of brothers ever to go to war			1
yet the full extent of their selfless patriotism is only just re-emerging after their place in history faded into virtual obscurity			0
their unique example earned public thanks and congratulation from @entity59 , the prime minister of the day , and the lord mayor of their home city of @entity64			1
their names were trumpeted in a recruiting drive at the time and even broadcast in local cinemas			0
@entity70 , 39 , @entity71 @entity72 , 36 , @entity73 @entity74 , 29 , 9th @entity29 @entity75 , 33 , 4th @entity29 today , as @entity4 prepares to honour all those who served in the @entity77 , few have ever heard of them			1
yesterday their family spoke proudly of the brothers ’ legacy and of ‘ deep admiration ’ for the way they responded to the call			1
none knew the @entity13 boys had been praised by the @entity10 until told this week by the @entity89			1
in a @entity92 letter , we can reveal , the brothers ’ parents @entity95 and @entity96 – a housewife and her builder ’s labourer husband – were told @entity100 had heard the news ‘ with the deepest gratification ’			1
he offered the new recruits ‘ best wishes for success , health and happiness in their noble career ’			0
@entity110 , 32 , 3rd @entity29 @entity111 , 24 , @entity112 the @entity13 parents @entity95 and @entity72 and their only daughter @entity114 @entity115 , a grandson of able seaman @entity116 , who served on @entity33 , told the @entity89 : ‘ my father was always a little bit disappointed that they did n’t seem to get the recognition they deserved			0
it ’s an astonishing thing for ten brothers all to go to war and it ’s highly unlikely it will ever happen again			1
i ’m really pleased to think that what they did is being recognised			0
’ last night @entity127 was examining the information with a view to including the band of brothers in a new listing			1
the @entity132 said it could find no record of the ten – but described the story as ‘ hugely interesting ’			0
it plans to contact relatives to consider including the brothers in forthcoming exhibitions			2
most of the family lived in the early 1900s in a less than affluent area inside @entity64 ’s city walls			1
the @entity46 originally came to @entity144 from @entity145 , @entity146 , driven out by the 19th century potato famine			0
@entity72 and @entity95 were born in @entity64 and raised their children there			1
praise : a letter from the chief magistrate of @entity64 sent to the parents of the @entity96 brothers in september 1914 , the classic image of lord @entity158 declaring ‘ your country needs you ’ began to stare out from countless walls and buildings across @entity4			1
six brothers signed up for the @entity163 , most with the @entity165 infantry regiments			2
among them was @entity167 , a 32 - year - old former @entity168 boxing champion who had served in the @entity169			0
two more brothers joined the @entity171			2
@entity172 , 24 , had served nearly eight years in the @entity163 and was in @entity173 when war broke out			2
@entity175 , 32 , had been serving in @entity176			0
soon they would reunite with the other eight to fight ‘ the @entity180 ’ on land and at sea			0
although @entity77 records are sometimes inconclusive , it appears that @entity183 and mrs @entity184 saw all their boys come home despite overwhelming odds			1
how the @entity89 reported the story in september 1914 @entity110 was wounded in action , but , like the other brothers , returned to join his family			1
an ‘ acting corporal @entity13 ’ with the @entity193 , mentioned in despatches and listed in the @entity195 in 1917 , was almost certainly @entity111			0
also in 1917 , @entity26 , the youngest of the ten , was serving on @entity27 when it was sunk by a @entity197 u-boat			0
he was rescued from the water but suffered severe exposure			0
although he returned to work for a few years after the war , he died at the age of 32			2
private @entity203 , the eldest brother , was gassed in the trenches in @entity41 and shipped back to hospital in @entity206			0
he sent a @entity208 postcard to his wife to let her know he had landed safely in @entity144 , but died in november 1916 at the age of 39			0
ninety years later the father - of - seven ’s grand - daughter @entity211 and other family members tracked down his overgrown grave in @entity64 and held a remembrance sunday service there			1
mrs @entity211 , 79 , still has the postcard her grandfather sent home			0
‘ i ’m very proud of our family history and of the way the brothers responded , ’ she told me			1
‘ they obviously had a very strong patriotic spirit			0
but from the very first day they got over to @entity41 it was an absolute bloodbath			2
i hope it may never happen again but if it did , i do think today ’s generation would respond			0

@entity96 brothers , aged between 18 and 37 in 1914 , fought in @entity77
they were praised by @entity59 and the prime minister of the day
@entity236 thought to be the biggest band of brothers ever to go to war
