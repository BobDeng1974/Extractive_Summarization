by @entity0 published : 19:01 est , 26 january 2014 updated : 06:12 est , 29 january 2014 @entity0 ' @entity2 returns with the latest instalment of his new weekly column for @entity5			1
the former @entity7 boss does not hold back with his views on current issues in football			1
in this week 's column , why controversial @entity11 was right to make a stand over @entity15 abuse , young @entity17 striker @entity16 will thrive on loan at @entity19 and @entity20 will be given time to rebuild at @entity22			1
@entity23 there is no doubt , in days gone by , that @entity11 has got himself into some very tricky situations			2
however , i believe he is a fantastic broadcaster – very knowledgeable , well - researched , at times controversial yet eloquent – and nobody deserves the abuse that he has received on @entity15			1
taking a stand : @entity11 suspended his @entity15 account during the week in protest at abuse i also do n’t feel it gives people the right to have a go at him just because of his past			1
i used to be on @entity15 until one night , sat at the front of the @entity42 team bus on the way home from a win at @entity46 , a few of their supporters – and it was only a few – started giving me dog ’s abuse			1
‘ sign up here to the party when @entity0 dies , ’ one said			2
‘ let ’s hope he gets cancer , ’ another added			2
and there were a couple of others of that nature			2
abuse : @entity11 spoke out after receiving a torrent of abuse on the social networking site demand for action : @entity11 said @entity15 should do more to block offensive messages i finally arrived back , absolutely seething and wanting to drive back up to @entity68 to find them			1
i awoke the next morning and cancelled my account , relieved to be free of the hassle and the stress it caused			2
@entity15 can be fun , and i hope @entity11 does n’t stop getting behind the keyboard with his controversial and strong views			1
if it was n’t for people like him life would be boring			2
the biggest signing of the @entity81 ? the best piece of business in the transfer window so far involves a @entity17 player – but forget @entity86			1
@entity19 have signed 20 - year - old centre - forward @entity16 on loan from the @entity88			1
big future : @entity16 celebrates scoring for @entity19 at @entity90 on saturday			2
the young striker is on loan from @entity17 watch out for this young man			1
with his pace , body frame and finishing he reminds me of a young @entity97			1
he ’s done a fantastic job at @entity99 in @entity100 in the first half of this season , scoring 17 goals in 30 games			2
top form : after scoring 17 goals in 30 matches for @entity99 in his previous loan spell , @entity16 has started with two in three games for @entity19 and @entity16 has already scored twice in three games , coming off the bench for @entity112			1
they say promotion to the @entity115 is worth £ 120million			2
if @entity16 starts firing this master swoop from @entity112 could be worth a fortune			2
@entity118 backed no @entity86 what it ’s heartening to read that sir @entity121 has assured @entity20 that his job is safe at @entity22 and that he will be the man to rebuild the club			1
after the @entity125 semi-final defeat to @entity126 he would have been looking over his shoulder , worrying and wondering			0
and with constant speculation in the media and on social networks about his future , he would not have slept and will be feeling very uncomfortable			0
backing : @entity20 will be given time to mould @entity22 in his own image , according to his predecessor sir @entity121 on top of the strains and stresses of recent results , he ’s been pictured flying all over @entity140 looking to find players that will make a difference			1
their squad is nowhere near the standards we have seen at @entity22 over recent years and is poor in comparison to @entity17 , @entity149 and @entity150			1
fightback : @entity20 was delighted to welcome @entity86 into his squad after signing him for £ 37million from @entity17 last week signing @entity86 would definitely not have been his priority , when they already had the attacking options of @entity156 and @entity157 combined with @entity158 and @entity159			1
it is a very handy forward line with many different options			0
but the spine of his team desperately needs two centre - backs and two central midfield players and a clear - out of the old school who are walking around saying ‘ we did n’t used to do this ’ or ‘ we did n’t used to do that ’ in training			0
@entity172 … @entity174 ’s @entity173 breaking two bones in his leg against @entity177 brings back some horrible memories for me			0
one of my former @entity99 players @entity181 – who was a dedicated , hard - working , conscientious central midfielder – was involved in a fairly innocuous tackle , 10 yards in front of my technical area , playing at @entity42 back in 2007			1
horrific : @entity186 holds the leg of @entity173 after he sustained two broken bones in his leg during the @entity191 fourth round tie with @entity177 on saturday it was clear instantly , as his leg dangled from his knee down like a piece of wet spaghetti , that @entity196 had a serious problem			0
it ’s a horrible feeling as a manager when one of your players suffers a bad injury			0
i remember sitting there , not bothered about the score or the rest of the game			0
i felt sick and just wanted to leave			0
when i finally got to the hospital in @entity211 at half - past - six a top orthopaedic surgeon had been called specially , such was the damage			0
long lay - off : @entity173 was carried off on a stretcher and ruled out until the end of the season he looked at the results of the x-ray , spoke to @entity196 then called me aside			0
he informed me the impact of the injury , from the bottom of his heel , through his ankle and into his shin , was very similar to the head - on car crash victims he usually deals with			1
@entity196 was only 27 , but he would never play again			0
i gave him the job of scouting our opposition and analysing our own team performances at @entity99			0
soon after i left to go to @entity229 he was appointed chief scout before being head - hunted at @entity231 where he is now head of recruitment			0
it was a bit of a disappointing weekend in the @entity191 for the underdogs , but the magic of the @entity237 was there for all to see last week			1
my nephew @entity239 , who just turned 17 , captained @entity241 ’s youth team against @entity242 on a cold and windy wednesday night at @entity245 ’s @entity244 stadium			0
complete control : @entity242 's youngsters thought they had the game won when @entity249 ( third left ) scored a free - kick to put them 3 - 0 up comeback is on : but @entity241 mounted a fightback to 2 - 3 , with @entity254 ( centre ) converting a penalty for the first at 3 - 0 up , it looked like a straightforward evening for @entity115 @entity242 against my nephew ’s @entity259 side			0
@entity241 looked well and truly out of it			0
but then , they scored twice and suddenly hysterical parents were screaming and shouting from the terraces urging their sons on			0
each goal scored by both teams sent all 10 outfield players up celebrating by the corner flag like a scene from @entity272			1
so close : @entity241 's @entity254 struck the underside of the bar in the 89th minute when @entity241 struck the underside of the bar with a shot in the 89th - minute but the ball did n’t go in , the sighs of relief from the mum sat next to me supporting her @entity242 son was a sight to be treasured			0
@entity242 went through 3 - 2 – and i ’ve got to thank the @entity242 player ’s mum for sharing her bag of @entity287 with me throughout the game			0
i left there a very proud uncle , wondering whether one day @entity239 might make the big step up			0
scrap : @entity242 's @entity293 ( right ) and @entity241 's @entity295 battle for the ball			0

broadcaster was right to question why @entity15 does *n't* tackle abuse
on loan goal machine @entity301 is similar to a young @entity97
mata signing was a good start as @entity20 looks to rebuild @entity22
magic of the @entity237 found at @entity308
