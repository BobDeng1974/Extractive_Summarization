and also the gay marriage stuff - there 's a lot of conservatives out there who perhaps were n't necessarily supportive , who also feel rather bitter about that			0
' asked if she should rethink her position , he replied : ' no , i do n't think so			0
' and he warned : ' my view generally is that i 'm supportive of @entity1 , because if we are not careful we end up with a witch - hunt of somebody			2
' a member of staff at @entity148 estate agency , which sold it , said : ' it was sold at the beginning of march , it went quite quickly in the end			0

the report resulted from an allegation made by the member for @entity182			0
' the committee has dismissed his allegation			0
the committee has recommended that i apologise to the @entity84 for my attitude to the commissioner ’s inquiries , and i of course unreservedly apologise			0

' mrs @entity1 said she spent the majority of her time in her constituency home , but tended to spend three nights per week at her @entity29 home when the @entity198 was sitting			1
the committee ruled that she should have made a formal arrangement to reduce her mortgage claims in 2008 when the base rate dropped , so her parents , who lived with her , were not benefiting from expenses claims			0
it found that her parents ' living costs were not being paid by the taxpayer and cleared her of making false expenses claims , but said her submission of ' incomplete ' evidence to the inquiry had breached the @entity59 ' code of conduct			0
the @entity217 's @entity216 feed was hacked on saturday , with the rogue poster tweeting : ' @ @entity219 is like a modern day @entity221 , she robs the poor to help the rich ' and ' seriously though guys , which one of us has n't embezzled and cheated the taxpayer ? ' mrs @entity1 could not be reached for a comment			1
@entity1 bought her house in @entity229 , south - west @entity29 , for £ 234,000 in 1995 many of the questions raised over @entity1 ’s expenses claims centred on the @entity229 property that she designated as her second home			1
critics felt that because her parents lived in the house , it should be designated as her main residence – not the rented cottage in her @entity240 constituency			1
the @entity10 bought the property with her solicitor husband @entity242 for just £ 234,000 in 1995 – while she still worked as an executive for @entity29 agency @entity244			1
taxpayers were billed for the interest on the mortgage for four years from 2005 – the year mrs @entity1 became mp for @entity34 – because she designated it as her second home			1
the couple made more than £ 1.2million on the property when it was sold in february for £ 1.47million			1
mrs @entity1 , a 50 - year - old mother of three , was appointed @entity10 and minister for women and equality in a 2012 @entity81 reshuffle .			0

she had designated a house in @entity29 as her ' second home '
it allowed her to claim mortgage interest payments from the taxpayer
but the report said the property *appeared* to be her main residence
she has since sold the house in @entity229 for £ 1.47million
@entity1 has today faced calls to resign but has been backed by @entity94
