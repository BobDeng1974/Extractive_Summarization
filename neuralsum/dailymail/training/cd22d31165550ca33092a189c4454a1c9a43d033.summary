by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor the @entity2 is giving serious consideration to a move that would ban smoking on all military bases , and on naval ships around the world			1
' i think we owe it to our people to review the military 's tobacco sales policy , ' defense secretary @entity9 told surprised reporters during a monday briefing			1
the decision would stand in sharp contrast to iconic images of @entity23 doughboys and sailors at sea with cigarettes in their mouths , and @entity28 smoking celebratory cigars after successful missions			0
sergeant first class @entity31 ( @entity33 ) and staff sergeant @entity34 ( r ) enjoyed these cigars sat a bar on the @entity36 based near @entity37 nearly 10 years ago , but the practice may go the way of the dodo thinking about it : secretary of defense @entity9 will consider a broad effort to ban the sale of tobacco on military bases and naval vessels smoking has been a permitted pleasure , albeit an unhealthy one , for servicemen and women for as long as there has been a @entity1 military , but that 's set to change as @entity56 make a political move five @entity1 senators , all democrats , are urging navy secretary @entity60 to take the idea seriously and make naval stations and ships the first step in a larger military - wide change			1
but at least one member of @entity68 , a @entity28 veteran , is pushing back , calling it a ' personal decision ' of fighting men and women			1
' we urge you to do everything in your capacity to address this issue for our military men and women , ' the five lawmakers wrote to @entity60 on monday , ' including moving forward with the proposal to stop the sale of tobacco aboard all naval bases and ships			1
' the letter was signed by sens. @entity90 of @entity91 , @entity92 of @entity93 , @entity94 of @entity95 , @entity96 of @entity97 and @entity98 of @entity99			0
citing a 2009 @entity2 report that estimated a $ 1.9 billion smoking - related cost in health expenses and lost productivity , they said the initiative would ' renew emphasis on the health of our dedicated sailors and @entity28 as well as provide for increased combat readiness			2
' rep. @entity111 , a @entity113 @entity112 who joined the @entity28 after the 9/11 terror attacks and served tours in @entity117 in @entity118 , objected			0
' overall , removing tobacco sales is perceived more as a political decision , intended to make a point , than it is a decision that supports our sailors and @entity28 – regardless of personal feelings on the individual and legal use of tobacco products , ' he wrote to @entity60			2
in its quest to maximize military readiness , @entity111 said in his letter , ' the @entity131 should wo smoking breaks are common on @entity36 bases , but some want the practice killed off because it sends the message that smoking is acceptable times change : in 1950 , @entity1 troops in @entity140 were often pictured with @entity1 - made cigarettes hanging from their mouths rry less about intruding on the personal decision - making of these same sailors and @entity28			1
' smoking rates have declined among active duty military personnel in recent years , due in part to an existing safety - related tobacco ban on submarines , and the @entity2 's provision of smoking - cessation services for soldiers , sailors , airmen and @entity28 who want to kick the habit			1
but in 2011 , social scientists at the @entity157 found that more than 30 percent of @entity1 troops are smokers , compared to 20 percent of @entity1 civilians			1
@entity162 bases ended a program in 2012 that offered cigarette discounts to on - base personnel			0
@entity131 base commissaries also no longer sell tobacco			0
but the @entity169 run by the military – the famed ' @entity169 's – derive 4.5 per cent of all their sales from tobacco			2
in the @entity36 and @entity175 , that figure is 6 per cent			0
overall , the @entity2 reaps a $ 100 million windfall every year from tobacco profits , money that funds recreation programs on military bases and family support programs			2
a march 14 @entity2 called for ' [ s ] tructural reforms in how and where we allow tobacco purchases to be made , as well as the need to consider tobacco - free installations , ' saying they were ' matters that require our near - term attention			1
the memo came from @entity191 , and assistant secretary of defense for health affairs dr. @entity192			0
' the prominence of tobacco products in retail outlets and permission for smoking breaks while on duty sustain the perception that we are not serious about reducing the use of tobacco , ' they wrote			0
any decision about forbidding tobacco sales on military bases and ships would have to be made at the highest levels of the @entity2			2
technically possible , but difficult : soldiers , sailors , airmen and @entity28 could still smoke , but they 'll have to find another ay to buy cigarettes and cigars nudge : senate majority whip @entity94 , an @entity95 @entity216 , is leading a group of five liberal senators who want the @entity131 to ban sales of smokes as a first step toward a tobacco - free military smoke - free workplace ? the @entity225 , wshown leaving @entity224 in 2013 , would be among hundreds of naval ships where no one could buy cigarettes @entity60 told the paper last week that ' we demand that sailors and @entity28 be incredibly fit			1
we know tobacco hurts that fitness			0
we know the cost of health care far exceeds any profits we could possibly make selling that			0
' he wrote in a 2012 memo that ' [ t ] obacco use is the most avoidable public health hazard in the @entity131 and @entity28			0
' that followed a 2009 @entity2 statement , issued early in the @entity245 administration , saying for the first time that it ' supports a smoke - free military and believes it is achievable			1
' representatives of @entity251 , a major cigarette producer , and a spokesman for the @entity254 lobby group , did not immediately respond to requests for comment .			0

@entity259 senators want @entity2 ' to stop the sale of tobacco aboard all naval bases and ships '
@entity112 congressman fires back that it 's a ' political decision ' that *tramples* on active military men and women 's ' personal decision - making '
an acting defense *undersecretary* says there 's a ' need to consider tobacco - free installations '
@entity2 chief @entity9 calls it serious : ' i do *n't* know if anybody in @entity1 still thinks that tobacco is good for you '
a 2011 @entity157 study found that more than 30 percent of @entity1 troops smoke
