by @entity0 in pain : @entity2 has been left with permanent nerve damage , affecting her leg and foot a mum - of - two has been forced to live the rest of her life in excruciating pain after spending two years with a metal screw lodged in her spine			1
@entity2 , 36 , complained to doctors 30 times that she was weak because of the piece of metal incorrectly inserted into a major nerve by surgeons at @entity19 in @entity20 , @entity21			1
despite having spinal surgery intended to improve a condition in her spine in april 2010 , the misplaced screw was not identified for 18 months , by which her symptoms grew progressively worse			1
ms @entity2 from @entity29 , @entity28 experienced pins and needles and weakness and was left with permanent nerve damage affecting her leg and foot as the damage increased over time			1
she said : ' the last few years have been a complete nightmare and i am still in pain which will never go away due to the damage to my nerves			0
' i do n’t feel like the same person as i was before the operation , but i do try to remain positive each day			0
' it is very difficult , especially struggling with the little things in life that we all take for granted such as taking my youngest to and from school , or not being able to do the housework like i used to be able to do			1
' in march 2012 , the screw was eventually removed - nearly two years after the original surgery - but the damage to the nerve was irreversible			1
@entity54 and @entity55 admitted there had been a failure to arrange further imaging after an x-ray and an mri scan were incorrectly interpreted			1
expert medical evidence found that if the screw had been identified and removed shortly after the original surgery , as the @entity55 accepted that it should have been , the damage to the nerve would not have progressed and @entity2 's symptoms would have largely resolved			1
x-ray : @entity54 and @entity55 admitted there had been a failure to arrange further imaging after an x-ray and an mri scan were incorrectly interpreted mistake : the mum - of - two will live the rest of her life in excruciating pain but has received compensation ms @entity2 has been awarded an undisclosed five - figure settlement to cover her loss of earnings as she was unable to return to work after the original surgery and will be unable to work ever again			1
she will also use the compensation to fund further treatment to aid her recovery			0
the former secretary , said : ' i have n’t been able to work since the surgery and i would love to do so , but unfortunately due to my condition i am very limited as to what work i can do			0
' we went to @entity87 in 2011 , but i was in so much pain that i had to sit down while my family enjoyed the rides			0
' we 're going back soon but i still wo n't be able to get on the rides because of my symptoms			0
i 'll never be able to go on the big rides again			0
' it 's affected my whole family because i cant join in with them as much as i 'd like to			0
' i 'd like to work but i would need a desk job with limited hours as i ca n't stand for long			0
' i 'm trying to remain positive and will do what i can to make it happen			0
i want to rebuild my life as much as possible			0
' i feel i was let down by the @entity100 as i felt i was passed from pillar to post for two years whilst i was experiencing the most excruciating pain of my life			2
i hope that lessons have been learned by the @entity55 to prevent this happening to anyone else			2
' positive : @entity2 says she had experienced pins and needles and weakness but says that she is trying to remain positive and will rebuild her life as much as possible after a ct scan , right , revealed the truth ms @entity2 recalls how she began experiencing back pain whilst she was pregnant with her first daughter in 1999			1
in 2002 she was referred by her gp for an mri scan and was told she had degeneration of the discs in her spine			0
over the next eight years , she went to hospital every six months for x-rays and an annual @entity123 scan to check on her condition			0
but the pain worsened and in 2010 she had surgery at @entity19 to stabilise her spine in a bid to repair the damage			2
following her surgery , @entity2 ’s back pain improved but almost immediately , she became aware of a sharp excruciating pain in her left leg and left big toe			1
she was initially advised that the pain would settle and was nothing to be concerned about			0
however , over the next few months , @entity2 noticed numbness and loss of feeling in her leg , describing it as feeling ‘ not like her own ’			1
by early 2011 , the numbness in @entity2 ’s left foot and leg had begun to spread and she had lost the feeling all the way up to two inches below her knee cap			2
later that year , @entity2 had a ct scan and x-ray which identified one screw at a different angle to all of the others and the surgeon explained that the top of the screw was rubbing away at the nerves causing the pain and loss of feeling in her leg and foot			1
@entity2 was told she would need further surgery to remove the screw and underwent an operation in march 2012			2
@entity163 , an expert medical lawyer at @entity164 , who represented @entity2 , said : ' the impact of the surgery on @entity2 ’s life has been devastating			1
' she struggled with her symptoms for years and when she sought advice , no one identified the cause of the problems and she was made to feel that it was ‘ all in her head ’			0
' understandably , she feels very let down by the medical professionals she trusted			0
' @entity2 ’s symptoms have affected her ability not only to work , but to carry out her day - to - day life with her family and all of this has had a significant impact on her confidence			1
she feels that she is not the bubbly , outgoing person that she was before all of this happened			0
' the screw ’s position was indicated on an x-ray taken just two days after the initial surgery and because it was n’t spotted and rectified for two years it has now caused permanent damage to the nerves , leaving @entity2 suffering needlessly			2
' we are pleased that the @entity55 admitted liability and the settlement reflects the severity of @entity2 ’s condition and the impact it has had on her life			1
' sadly the mistakes that were made have left @entity2 in an even more debilitating position than she was before surgery			2
' we hope the @entity55 has learned from this and will ensure that patient safety is improved in follow up to future spinal surgery			2
