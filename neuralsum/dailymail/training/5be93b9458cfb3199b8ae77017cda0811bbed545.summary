in early 2010 , @entity48 and mrs @entity7 learned that they were expecting a baby			1
although unplanned , the couple eagerly awaited the birth of their daughter - whom they had decided to call @entity56			1
mrs @entity7 carried @entity56 full term , but during an antenatal appointment on december 27 , 2010 , medical staff were unable to find a heartbeat			1
the couple were told their daughter had died			1
two days later - on @entity56 's due - date – mrs @entity7 gave birth to the still - born baby			1
the couple discovered their baby had died more than a week earlier , leaving mrs @entity7 dangerously ill with a uterine infection			1
the couple had a stillborn daughter , @entity56 , just a year before the triplets were born			1
she was born on her due date but had died in the womb ‘ it was really hard , really difficult , ’ said mrs @entity7 , a part - time leisure centre worker			1
‘ it was an awful couple of days between finding out and giving birth			2
we did n't go out of the house			0
‘ we used those two days to come to terms with what went on and what was going to happen			0
‘ the worst part was telling the kids			0
@entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 were all young but we had to tell them something , they were expecting a baby sister			1
‘ we said that @entity56 had been poorly and the doctors could n't fix her			2
‘ then @entity18 said , “ well you 'll just have to have another one ”			2
‘ looking at @entity6 , i knew he felt the same , and we started trying again as soon as we could			0
' within two months , mrs @entity7 found out that she was expecting again , but at a scan she found out the baby had stopped growing and died			2
in early 2010 @entity48 and mrs @entity7 learned they were expecting a baby			1
their daughter , @entity56 , was stillborn on december 29 , 2010			1
in february 2011 mrs @entity7 became pregnant again but she miscarried			2

the baby died six weeks into the pregnancy			0
in july 2011 the triplets were conceived during the couple 's honeymoon			2
they were born on january 29 , 2012			0
the couple were desperate for another baby , but three months later , they were apprehensive when mrs @entity7 became pregnant again			1
their fears were realised , when she suffered a second miscarriage at six weeks			0
‘ after everything we had been through i could n't cope with anything more , ’ said mrs @entity7			2
‘ we decided to stop trying and just leave it to fate			0
if it was meant to happen it would happen			0
’ in the summer of 2011 , the family decided to go on holiday to @entity26 , where , unknown to their family and friends , they decided to get married			0
during their honeymoon , mrs @entity7 conceived again			2
because of the earlier problems , the couple wasted no time in visiting the hospital for a scan			0
‘ it was the same nurse that had told me @entity56 had died , ’ said mrs @entity7			1
‘ running the scanner over my stomach , she turned to me and said , “ i do n't know how to tell you this ” , and i just thought , “ oh no , not again , ” but then she announced , “ it 's twins ”			0
‘ but i just could n't get excited , if anything i was more scared			0
i thought i was going to lose another two babies			0
’ mrs @entity7 was in for a further shock			2
when she attended the second scan , she was told she was not expecting two babies , but three			0
‘ when the nurse first said i was having triplets i thought she was winding me up			0
‘ i sat in the car park for half an hour after the scan and just cried my eyes out			0
' mrs @entity7 was too fearful to get excited , with the previous miscarriages never far from her mind			1
‘ i was just going through the motions , ’ she said			0
‘ i did n't buy anything for the babies - i did n't want to tempt fate			0
’ the triplets were born nine weeks early but all are now healthy one - year - olds and mrs @entity7 says that the family is now complete the situation was put into perspective , however , when medics explained the high risk of miscarriage with triplets			1
having lost three babies in a row , mrs @entity7 was quick to decline the offer of reducing the number of foetuses she was carrying in order to give the remaining ones a stronger chance of survival			2
she said : ‘ you ca n't pick and choose , can you ? i just realised that whatever was meant to be , would be			0
’ the couple had previously found out they were expecting three boys and chose the names , @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34			1
‘ i wanted a natural delivery , but they said no because @entity33 's cord was a lot thinner than it should have been , but as it was , he came out naturally and quickly , ’ said mrs @entity7			1
‘ they were already performing the caesarean section , so the other two were born that way			0
’ they were born on january 29 last year , nine weeks early			1
@entity33 was the smallest at 2llb 2oz , his identical twin , @entity34 , was 3lb 3oz and @entity32 was 3lb 6oz			1
after a rocky start due to their small size , the triplets are now happy one - year - olds , with very different personalities			1
‘ @entity32 's the softy , ’ said mrs @entity7			1
‘ he loves his cuddles			0
‘ @entity34 is quite cheeky			2
he 's the nosy one , if anyone comes in the house he 's first to investigate			0
‘ @entity33 is the strong one			2
he never gives up on anything			0
‘ it 's hectic sometimes and six kids might seem like a lot to some , but this mad house is the only place i 'd want to be			0
‘ i 'll never forget @entity56 and our other babies , but finally our family is complete			2
