the tv licence fee could be scrapped and replaced with subscriptions in the biggest shake - up since the @entity3 was founded in 1922			1
some members of the @entity5 are understood to believe the compulsory £ 145.50 annual charge for television ownership is increasingly outdated			2
senior industry figures also believe a fundamental rethink is required in a multi-channel age with more and more viewers using computers and mobile phones to watch programmes on internet catch - up services			1
last week culture secretary @entity16 told the @entity17 the licence fee could be cut , saying : ' £ 145.50 is a lot of money for some people ' the @entity3 ’s royal charter , which sets out the corporation ’s scope and remit , and funding arrangement – both ten - year agreements – is up for renewal at the end of 2016			1
the government has already announced a review of whether non-payment of the licence fee should be decriminalised			2
ministers say it can not be right that 200,000 people a year end up in court accused of not buying a tv licence			2
they face fines of up to £ 1,000 and a criminal record , with more than 50 a year going to prison			0
one possibility is for new technology to be used to cut off @entity3 channels for those who have not paid			0
decriminalising non-payment for a licence , supported by most of the @entity5 , would pave the way for more fundamental reform in the charter review , which will begin in earnest after the election			1
@entity52 , who was a member of a review panel set up by the @entity3 to assess the corporation ’s future , strongly supported decriminalisation of the non-payment of licence fees one possibility is a subscription model , whereby viewers who want @entity3 services purchase a ‘ bundle ’ of channels , or even individual programmes or series			1
subscriptions could replace some or all of the compulsory licence fee – breaking the link between owning a tv set and the licence fee			0
an alternative model , being used in @entity72 , @entity73 and the @entity74 , would see a payment for the national broadcaster simply rolled into household taxes			0
like other areas of public spending it would be subject to cuts in times of austerity			0
last week culture secretary @entity16 told the @entity17 the licence fee could be cut			1
‘ £ 145.50 is a lot of money for some people , ’ he said			1
‘ it ’s incumbent on all public bodies to be vigilant when spending other people ’s money and the @entity3 is no exception to this			1
’ the @entity95 culture and media committee has launched an inquiry into the future of the @entity3			2
@entity98 , the @entity98 mp who chairs the committee , told a party conference meeting this week it was ‘ getting steadily harder to sustain the licence fee ’			0
he described compulsory licences as deeply unfair on those who can not afford to pay the fee and end up in jail			0
@entity52 , a former @entity106 and @entity107 television executive , who was a member of a review panel set up by the @entity3 to assess the corporation ’s future , said earlier this year : ‘ it is socially unjust that so many are fined and indeed go to prison for not paying the licence fee			1
‘ and it makes more sense too for the @entity3 to move to subscription from 2020 , which is about the date when set - boxes go , and standard definition tv is phased out			1
’ you need a tv licence if you watch or record tv as it is being broadcast			0
this includes the use of devices such as a computer , mobile or dvd recorder			0
under a subscription model , rival broadcasters such as @entity107 would be free			0
a @entity3 spokesman said : ' at 40p a day the @entity132 is tremendous value and ensures that everyone gets access to great content that informs , educates and entertains			0
' support for the licence fee has risen by 22 per cent since 2004 and remains the most popular way of funding the @entity3 across all ages and socio - economic backgrounds			2
