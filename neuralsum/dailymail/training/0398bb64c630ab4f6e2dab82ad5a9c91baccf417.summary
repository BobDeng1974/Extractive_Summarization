by @entity0 published : 19:27 est , 20 may 2013 updated : 11:31 est , 21 may 2013 @entity1 has avoided paying billions in income tax by using dummy headquarters abroad , according to a damaging @entity5 report , but @entity6 has today denied it is to blame			1
an investigation by a @entity5 committee said the tech giant sought the ' @entity10 of tax avoidance ' schemes by not declaring tax residency in any country			1
@entity6 deputy prime minister @entity15 today said it was not to blame for @entity1 's low global tax payments and said they had no special rate with the company			1
the denial comes after the @entity5 said @entity1 paid little or no tax on tens of billions of dollars stashed in @entity6 subsidiaries			1
@entity5 investigation found @entity1 uses affiliate companies in @entity6 ( pictured ) to avoid billions in @entity27 income tax the report , published yesterday by the @entity29 yesterday , found that @entity1 holds $ 102billion of its $ 145billion in cash			1
an @entity6 subsidiary that earned $ 22billion in 2011 paid only $ 10million in taxes			2
the @entity6 government , which has seen the luring of @entity27 multinationals with low taxes as a key part of its economic policy since the 1960s , said its system was transparent and other countries were responsible if the tax rate paid by @entity1 was too low			1
he told national broadcaster @entity44 : ' they are issues that arise from the taxation systems in other jurisdictions , and that is an issue that has to be addressed first of all in those jurisdictions			0
' the @entity5 subcommittee identified three subsidiaries that have no tax residency either in @entity6 , where they are incorporated , or in the @entity27 , where those companies are managed			1
the main subsidiary , a holding company that includes @entity1 's retail stores throughout @entity60 , has not paid any corporate income tax in the last five years , the report said			2
the report said : ' @entity6 has essentially functioned as a tax haven for @entity1 '			1
‘ @entity1 was n't satisfied with shifting its profits to a low - tax offshore tax haven , ’ sen. @entity64 , @entity65 , the subcommittee 's chairman , said			1
‘ @entity1 sought the @entity10 of tax avoidance			1
it has created offshore entities holding tens of billions of dollars , while claiming to be tax resident nowhere			0
’ the subcommittee 's report estimates that @entity1 avoided at least $ 3.5billion in @entity27 federal taxes in 2011 and $ 9 billion in 2012			1
@entity1 uses five affiliate companies located in @entity6 to carry out its tax strategy , according to the report			1
the companies are located at the same address in @entity80 , @entity6 , and they share members of their boards of directors			2
horses graze over the road from the @entity6 @entity1 headquarters on the edge of @entity80 senator @entity64 , right , said @entity1 sought ' the @entity10 of tax avoidance ' but company ceo @entity89 , left , who is traveling to @entity92 on tuesday , said they follow the letter and spirit of tax laws while all five companies were incorporated in @entity6 , only two of them also have tax residency in that country			1
that means the other three are not legally required to pay taxes in @entity6 because they are not managed or controlled in that country , in @entity1 's view			1
the report says @entity1 capitalizes on a difference between @entity27 and @entity6 rules regarding tax residency			1
in @entity6 , a company must be managed and controlled in the country to be a tax resident			2
under @entity27 law , a company is a tax resident of the country in which it was established			2
therefore , the @entity1 companies are not tax residents of @entity6 nor of the @entity27 , since they were not incorporated in the @entity27 the company , based in @entity121 , @entity122 , paid $ 2.5billion in federal taxes in 2011 and $ 6billion in 2012			1
the strategies @entity1 uses are legal , and many other multinational corporations use similar tax techniques to avoid paying @entity27 income taxes on profits they reap overseas			1
however , the tactics have raised questions about loopholes in the @entity27 tax code , lawmakers say			1
the spotlight on @entity1 's tax strategy comes at a time of fevered debate in @entity92 over whether and how to raise revenues to help reduce the federal deficit			1
many democrats complain that the government is missing out on collecting billions because companies are stashing profits abroad and avoiding taxes			0
@entity146 want to cut the corporate tax rate of 35 per cent and ease the tax burden on money that @entity27 companies make abroad			0
they say the move would encourage companies to invest at home			0
@entity1 ceo @entity89 , the company 's chief financial officer and its tax chief are scheduled to testify and explain the company 's tax strategy at a hearing by the subcommittee today			1
@entity1 's main headquarters are in @entity122 ( pictured ) but they have no apparent tax residency , the report said the company refuted the subcommittee 's assertions in testimony prepared for the hearing and released to the public yesterday evening			1
@entity1 said it employs tens of thousands of @entity27 and pays ‘ an extraordinary amount ’ in @entity27 taxes , citing the roughly $ 6billion it paid in fiscal 2012			1
@entity1 ‘ complies fully with both the laws and the spirit of the laws , ’ the testimony says			2
‘ and @entity1 pays all its required taxes , both in this country and abroad			0
@entity1 does not use tax gimmicks			0
' the company insisted that it does not , as the subcommittee asserts , move its intellectual property rights into offshore tax havens and use it to sell products back into the @entity27 to avoid taxes			1
the company has made clear that given current @entity27 tax rates , it has no intention of repatriating its overseas profits to the @entity27 @entity1 reiterated in its testimony its support for comprehensive tax reform as a way to support economic growth and boost @entity27 companies ' competitiveness			1
the subcommittee also has examined the tax strategies of @entity195 , @entity196 and other multinational companies , finding that they too have avoided billions in @entity27 taxes by shifting profits offshore and exploiting weak , ambiguous sections of the tax code			2
@entity195 has used ‘ aggressive ’ transactions to shift assets to subsidiaries in @entity205 , @entity6 and @entity206 , in part to avoid taxes			0
@entity196 has used complex offshore loan transactions worth billions while using the money to run its @entity27 operations , according to the panel			0
@entity1 says it ' complies fully with both the laws and the spirit of the laws ' and pays all required taxes the subcommittee 's inquiry and hearing are intended to shine a light on ‘ offshore tax - avoidance tactics ’ by @entity1 , @entity64 said at a news conference monday with sen. @entity224 of @entity225 , the panel 's senior @entity146			1
companies ' use of such loopholes has the effect of raising the taxes of ordinary @entity27 and increasing the federal deficit , he said			2
@entity224 said that while @entity1 claims to be the biggest @entity27 corporate taxpayer , it is also ‘ among @entity27 's largest tax avoiders			2
’ he called @entity1 's strategy ‘ an egregious and really outrageous scheme that @entity1 has been able to orchestrate to avoid paying taxes			2
’ the subcommittee report also noted that @entity1 has been setting aside billions for tax bills it may never pay			0
as previously reported by @entity241 , the overlooked asset that @entity1 has been building up could boost @entity1 's profits by as much as $ 10.5billion			0
however , @entity1 has been lobbying to change @entity27 law so it can erase its tax liabilities in a less conspicuous fashion			2
in its second quarter ended march 31 , @entity1 posted its first profit decline in ten years			0

investigations are currently underway in both the @entity27 and @entity275 into corporations who have a turnover of billions but pay a fraction of that in taxes			0
in the @entity275 , @entity282 was accused of doing evil ' by a parliamentary committee after mps claimed the internet giant by using ' devious , calculated and unethical ' trucks to minimize its liabilities			0
it paid just £ 7.3million in corporation tax last year despite having a @entity275 turnover of £ 3billion			0
elsewhere , @entity269 could be investigated by the @entity275 @entity291 after paying just £ 2.44million in corporation tax on @entity275 sales of £ 320million last year			0
but the @entity295 - based group told its investors that it actually made 13 times this amount , claiming the @entity275 sales were actually more than £ 4billion			0

it has since agreed to pay £ 20million in tax voluntarily after a public boycott over revelations it had paid no corporation tax since 2009			0
