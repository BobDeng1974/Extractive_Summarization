by @entity0 published : 20:08 est , 29 october 2012 updated : 02:35 est , 30 october 2012 clocking up the cash : the iconic @entity3 clock could be hired out to film - makers as a film set film directors could be invited to shoot inside the @entity3 clock tower to turn @entity8 into a moneyspinner			2
@entity10 want to charge production companies to gain access to the landmark as part of plans to raise an extra £ 3million a year by making the @entity17 ‘ operate more commercially as a visitor attraction ’			1
the idea comes after proposals to charge visitors to climb the tower , renamed the @entity3 in honour of the @entity23 after the @entity24 , were dropped			0
it raises the possibility of the @entity3 bell and the spiral staircase leading up to it being used as the centrepiece of an action movie			0
the clock has played a central role in many films – most notably the 1978 version of the @entity36 , in which the hero is seen hanging from its hands – but cameras are not usually allowed inside the tower itself			0
other suggestions , unveiled in a report by the @entity45 finance and services committee , include hiring out some of the @entity45 ’ most opulent dining rooms			1
there are plans to charge visitors for ‘ premium tours ’ of @entity51 , the most ancient part of @entity8			1
but the idea of using the home of @entity56 democracy as a cash cow could prove controversial			0
@entity59 mp @entity58 , who led the campaign against charging for entry to the tower , said : ‘ @entity8 should be for the people , and not become a theme park			0
‘ this is the greatest parliament in the world , in one of the oldest democracies in the world			0
' it should not be a plaything for film moguls and big business trying to make a quick buck			1
’ iconic : the clock has already featured in many films and tv programmes			1
here actor @entity78 and actress @entity79 are pictured filming scenes for tv show @entity81 by @entity3 it comes as the speaker considers a separate report on possible plans for vacating the houses of @entity8 while essential repairs are carried out			2
under the plans , mps could be forced to meet in the nearby @entity91 after the election , while @entity93 could have to sit in @entity94			2
in the meantime , however , mps are looking at ways to make more money out of the international fame of the houses of @entity8			1
they have a target of an extra £ 3million in revenue a year by 2015			0
the committee ’s report said : ‘ for many years the @entity94 has carried out revenue raising activities notably through catering , retail and visitor services			0
' these have been expanding in recent years , for example through saturday opening for visitors			0
‘ @entity109 agreed that there should be a clearer separation between @entity8 as a working body and @entity8 as a visitor attraction and agreed that the financial plans should be based on developing a number of activities for the @entity94 to operate more commercially as a visitor attraction			2
’ however , the report does suggest charging for tours of @entity51 , where @entity121 i was convicted of treason and members of the @entity124 lie in state			2
they are considering a ‘ tiered visitor admission offer including a short tour of @entity51 , an audio - guided tour and a premium tour with a guide ’			2
starring role : the clock has played a central role in many films ¿ most notably the 1978 version of the @entity36 , in which the hero is seen hanging from its hands another idea is to allow businesses and wealthy individuals to hire out some of @entity8 ’s most exclusive rooms for parties and other events ‘ on an experimental basis for two years on a limited number of occasions when they are not expected to be used by members ’			1
among them is the @entity151 , the large hall in @entity153 , where many mps have their office			0
the @entity151 hit the headlines earlier this year when it emerged that 12 fig trees there cost taxpayers thousands of pounds a year			0
mps could also open up the many dining rooms in the @entity17 with exclusive views across the @entity163 ; while another option is the @entity165 , a marquee standing on the terrace by the river			1
@entity170 mp @entity169 said : ‘ if these plans can make a profit for the taxpayer , i ’m all in favour			1
' let ’s follow the example of the @entity23 with @entity177 and make money out of this place			1
‘ why not go further , and set up the @entity93 chamber as a restaurant and tea room for tourists			0
’ last night the speaker received a report on possible plans for vacating the houses of @entity8 while repairs are carried out			1
the most likely option are the @entity91 near @entity190 for @entity10 and @entity94 for peers			1
other more drastic options are being considered , including creating an entirely new parliament building in @entity194			0
the idea has been proposed amid the soaring bill for repairing the grade i listed @entity17 , which is suffering from chronic subsidence , electrical problems , and various other safety hazards			1
the work , which will have to start shortly after the next general election , is expected to cost taxpayers more than £ 3 billion .			0
