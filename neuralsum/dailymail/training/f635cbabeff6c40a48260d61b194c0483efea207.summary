by @entity0 published : 11:22 est , 29 january 2014 updated : 12:23 est , 29 january 2014 @entity3 government forces have dropped barrel bombs on rebel - held districts of @entity7 killing 13 people , including children , according to a monitoring group			1
the latest slaughter came just hours after both sides congratulated themselves for ' positive ' developments at peace talks in @entity15 , following four days without a breakthrough			1
the @entity18 - based @entity17 said the new government offensive saw barrel - bombings in the @entity22 and @entity23 districts of south @entity7 , and separate gun battles on the main road toward the city 's @entity27 airbase and near the famous @entity30 castle @entity31			0
victim : a @entity3 man carries the body of a child out of the rubble of a destroyed building following barrel bomb air raids by government forces on rebel - held parts of @entity7 a woman and at least one child were killed in @entity22 when helicopter forces loyal to @entity3 's president @entity45 dropped controversial barrel bombs on the residential neighbourhood			1
the attacks are likely to have a negative effect on ongoing peace talks between the two sides , which only hours earlier were hailed as a ' positive step forward ' by a negotiator for the rebels			1
@entity55 , a spokesman for the opposition 's negotiating team , said the government delegation stuck to its demand that putting an end to terrorism remains its number one priority but added that it should be taken as a good sign that a change in government is now being openly discussed by both sides			0
even before today 's barrel bomb attacks , the credibility of the supposed breakthrough was being called into question , as both sides continue to blame each other for not taking the talks further			1
contradiction : only hours earlier , @entity55 , a spokesman for the opposition 's negotiating team hailed a ' positive step forward ' in ongoing peace talks in @entity15 @entity3 inspect the rubble of a destroyed building following barrel bomb air raids by government forces on the rebel - controlled part of @entity7 's @entity22 residential district even before today 's barrel bomb attacks , the credibility of a supposed breakthrough in the @entity87 ( pictured ) was being called into question the peace talks will come to a close of friday , with today 's attacks seen by many as confirmation there will not be a significant breakthrough before the negotiators leave @entity15			1
according to @entity55 , the government is now more willing to discuss the issue of @entity45 stepping down but he admitted it was still a subject they seem keen to push ' to the back of the discussion '			2
rebel spokesman @entity55 said the government is now more willing to discuss @entity45 stepping down @entity104 , an adviser to @entity3 president @entity45 , confirmed that both sides touched on the issue , but described today 's talks as constructive for another reason			2
' the talks have been positive today actually because they spoke about terrorism , ' she said			2
a deal to allow humanitarian aid into the besieged central city of @entity115 remains on ice , with the @entity3 delegation demanding assurances the aid will not go to ' armed and terrorist groups ' in the city			0
the talks were cut short yesterday over the @entity123 decision to restart deliveries of nonlethal aid to the @entity3 opposition , more than a month after @entity128 - linked militants seized warehouses and prompted a sudden cutoff of @entity132 supplies to the rebels			0
the officials said the communications equipment and other items are being funneled only to non-armed opposition groups , but the move boosts @entity3 's beleaguered rebels , who saw their international support slide , in large part because of the extremists among their ranks			0
the @entity17 estimated that 1,200 women , children and elderly people are trapped in besieged areas of the old quarter of @entity115			0
alongside the new government offensive , there was fresh fighting between ideologically opposed rebel factions in the town of @entity154 , where moderate fighters clashed with members of the jihadist @entity157 .			0

deadly air raids occur just hours after supposed ' peace talk breakthrough '
13 people , including children , were killed in the latest barrel bomb attack
peace talks will continue to take place in @entity15 until friday *afternoon*
negotiators for @entity45 forces and rebels both hail ' positive ' developments
