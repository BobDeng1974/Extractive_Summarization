by @entity0 a boy scout troop has been closed down after refusing to sack their openly gay scout master @entity2 the @entity3 have shut down a @entity5 troop after they refused to sack their openly gay scout master			1
@entity7 , 49 , was invited to help set up @entity8 at an inclusive methodist church in @entity5 last year , but was sacked at the start of the month by @entity3 officials after they found out he was gay			1
however , the church 's pastor and members of the troop refused to remove mr @entity2 and now the @entity3 have revoked the group 's charters , a move that has left mr @entity2 ' stunned			1
' he said : ' i 'm stunned and disappointed to hear the news			0
pastor @entity22 specifically sought out someone with my scouting background to help get these units off the ground , and her church is now being told to violate their religious convictions			0
it 's unconscionable and irreverent			0
' despite the @entity3 's move , @entity2 said that the church will continue to hold meetings for the 15 cubs and scouts who attend , even if they ca n't use the scouting name			1
he added : ' it 's one of the best things i do			0
one of the things that really makes my week is spending time with these kids			0
' ' nobody likes to be rejected from the company of people that you have valued			0
' i 've had to move on and accept that @entity3 , both national and regional , is not ready to be properly fully inclusive for all youth and adult leadership			2
' the 49 - year - old software developer says the decision has left him ' stunned ' and vowed he will continue holding meetings without using the @entity52 name mr @entity53 was invited to set up @entity8 in @entity5 last year by the pastor of an inclusive methodist church and says he was open about his sexuality with both members and officials @entity59 , executive director of @entity60 : ' @entity62 ’ decisions only serve to hurt a group of boys who need the values and leadership of someone like @entity68			1
' unfortunately , the @entity3 ’s decision calls into question its commitment to leadership and values by perpetuating an outmoded policy rooted in fear and discrimination			2
' history will show that today ’s announcement is a self - inflicted wound			0
' in january the @entity3 voted to allow gay youths into the scouts for the first time , but their rules still do not allow gay adults to run the troops			1
the organisation said they had been left with ' no choice ' but to sack mr @entity2 after he discussed his sexuality while being profiled by @entity89 , and said it was ' saddened ' by the latest developments			2
rev. @entity22 of @entity92 said it was important the the church remained open and inclusive to all , adding that she has obtained legal counsel			0
before his sacking , @entity2 believed he was the only openly - gay troop leader in the country			1
at the time @entity53 said : ' it ’s extremely disappointing to not be fully supported and defended in my membership			0
' they are complaining that the problem is a distraction to @entity105 and they do n’t seem to understand that the distraction is self - inflicted			0
' @entity2 started leading @entity8 98 last fall after he was asked by @entity108 of @entity109			1
no gay leaders : the @entity3 voted to allow gay youth into their ranks starting this year but that rule does not pertain to adult leaders			1
above , @entity2 addresses his troop at a parade @entity2 agreed to start the troop when asked by the reverend at his inclusive methodist church			1
he attends the @entity109 with his husband of more than 20 years ( pictured together above ) @entity121 wanted to start an inclusive troop for local youth , and reached out to @entity2 who attends the church with his husband of 20 years			1
@entity2 was hesitant to start the group at first because he had his own troubled history with the @entity3			1
when he was 22 - years - old , @entity2 was offered the position of assistant scoutmaster but that job was rescinded once his troop leaders figured out he was gay			1
the troop was also sponsored by his @entity133 church , and he was additionally excommunicated from the religion			0
he agreed to start the program , in part inspired by the work of his straight twin - brother @entity138 who has publicly championed for gays to be admitted into to the scouts			0
' if you do n’t participate , you 're not part of the conversation , ' @entity2 , a software engineer , said			2
' yelling from the outside is not conversing			0
so we 're on the inside doing good work			0
talking about the gay and lesbian issue is not the biggest part of what we do — it 's the smallest part			2
' but @entity2 makes clear that his decision to lead the troop was not part of a publicity stunt , but because he genuinely wanted to help out the local kids			2
and his troop at @entity92 , including their parents , thank him for his work			0
' anyone who is willing to step forward and provide an opportunity for our youth should be supported , and @entity2 has done an excellent job , ' said @entity166 , whose son , 14 - year - old son @entity167 is in the troop			1
' if anyone has an issue with this , then where are they ? ' wo n't stop : @entity2 says he will continue to lead the troop until relieved by his church 's reverend proud to be a scoutmaster : @entity2 waves a pride flag during an outing with his troop the troop currently consists of all straight boys , but gay high - schooler @entity184 , 17 , says he plans to join the troops after the end of the school year			1
@entity184 left another troop last year because it did n't feel gay - friendly			1
' i 'll be more comfortable going back into scouting and being in an inclusive troop , ' he said , adding that @entity2 will ' understand where i 'm coming from			2
' @entity2 certainly understands @entity184 's perspective , having experienced a similar isolation growing up and feeling like he was the only gay person around			2
' one of the things that ’s different now with our troop from when i was a youth in the @entity3 , was there were no identifiable gay or lesbian adults , ' @entity2 said			1
for his part , @entity2 hopes that ' cooler minds will prevail ' and he will be allowed to continue as scoutmaster			2
' that 's what i believe			0
if it does n't happen today , that will be disappointing			0
but it does n't mean it wo n't ever happen , ' he said .			0
