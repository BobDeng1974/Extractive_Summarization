published : 04:15 est , 28 january 2014 updated : 13:28 est , 28 january 2014 captured : @entity1 - one of the founders of the @entity4 drug cartel known as ' @entity5 ' - has been arrested @entity6 has legalized the country 's growing vigilante groups as security forces revealed the capture of one of the four top leaders of the @entity4 drug cartel			1
thousands of @entity6 across the country have joined the vigilante ' self - defense ' groups to fight the drug cartels ' ' reign of terror ' over civilians			1
the government yesterday announced it had reached an agreement with the vigilante group leaders to incorporate the armed civilian groups into old and largely forgotten quasi-military units called the @entity25			1
vigilante groups estimate their numbers at 20,000 men under arms			1
it comes as soldiers and police arrested one of the cartel 's top leaders , @entity1 , alias ' @entity5 ' or @entity5			1
the twin announcements may help the administration of president @entity39 find a way out of an embarrassing situation in the western state of @entity43 , where vigilantes began rising up last february against the @entity4 reign of terror and extortion after police and troops failed to stop the abuses			1
' the self - defense forces will become institutionalized , when they are integrated into the @entity25 , ' the @entity50 said in a statement			0
police and soldiers already largely tolerate , and in some cases even work with , the vigilantes , many of whom are armed with assault rifles that civilians are not allowed to carry			0
vigilante leaders will have to submit a list of their members to the @entity64 , and the army will apparently oversee the groups , which the government said ' will be temporary '			2
they will be allowed to keep their weapons as long as they register them with the army			0
the vigilante leaders , who include farmers , ranchers and some professionals , gathered on monday to discuss the agreement , but it was not yet clear for them what it would imply			0
it was n't known if the army would offer anyone salaries			0
@entity100 , a leader of the self - defense force in the town of @entity103 , said leaders had accepted the government proposal			0
but the nuts - and - bolts ' are still not well defined ' , he added			0
' we wo n't start working on the mechanisms until tomorrow			0
' vigilante leader @entity109 said in a television interview that the agreement also allows those who qualify to join local police forces			0
a member of the community police points a weapon at a deceased member of the @entity4 cartel after a clash near the village of @entity75 in @entity43 state vigilantes stand guard after hearing rumours of a possible ambush in @entity126 , @entity43 ' the majority of us want to get into the police ... i never imagined myself dressed as a policeman , but the situation is driving me to put on a uniform			2
' @entity134 has been bruised by experiences with quasi-military forces , with such tolerated or legally recognized groups being blamed for rights abuses in @entity139 and @entity140 in the past			2
while the cartel may be on its way out , ' there should n't be abuses by those who come after , there should n't be what we would call a witch hunt ; there should be reconciliation ' , said the rev. @entity153 , part of a team of priests in the @entity158 diocese of @entity82 who have publicly denounced abuses by the @entity4			2
the arrest of one of the cartel 's top leaders , @entity1 known as ' @entity5 ' , is a big step in the fight against the drug lords			1
vigilantes , who have been fighting the drug cartel across swathes of the failing @entity43 state , are pictured in the town of @entity172 after seizing control @entity175 secretary @entity174 said the feared cartel leader was arrested without a shot being fired			1
he said federal forces found @entity179 in @entity180 , the capital of @entity43 , ' hiding in a closet ' and accompanied only by 16 - year - old boy			2
the 58 - year - old @entity179 had a 30 - million peso ( $ 2.25 million ) reward on his head from the @entity6 government for drug , organized crime and money - laundering charges			1
he was considered one of the country 's three dozen most - wanted drug lords in the late 2000s			0
@entity179 got his nickname , ' @entity5 , ' because he is believed to be the uncle of another top @entity4 leader , @entity195			1
@entity179 joined @entity196 and @entity197 in forming the @entity4 after the purported death of @entity199			2
armed : the vigilantes , pictured in @entity75 , will now be incorporated into quasi-military units and fight alongside the police against the drug cartels a local journalist from @entity43 recounted watching when @entity179 led a sort of pilgrimage to a shrine erected to @entity199 and had his assistants hand out 500 - peso ( $ 37 ) bills to people who attended			1
the @entity4 ruled many parts of @entity43 with an iron fist , demanding extortion payments from businesses , farmers and workers , but the self - defense groups have gained ground against the cartel in recent months			1
federal police and army troops were dispatched to bring peace to the troubled region , but the vigilantes have demanded the arrest of the cartel 's major leaders before they lay down their guns			0
@entity229 , an activist in the vigilante movement from the town of @entity232 , which was the first to rise up against the @entity4 , said the arrest ' means a lot ' to the vigilantes , but added that they wo n't rest until they see all the top bosses arrested			2
@entity229 voiced a common belief that the man who founded the cartel under the name @entity243 , @entity199 , @entity244 ' , is still alive , despite the government 's statement in 2010 that he had been killed in a shootout with federal forces			0
' he 's still alive ; there 's proof he 's still alive , ' @entity229 said .			0

around 20,000 @entity6 have joined vigilante groups to fight the drug cartels ' ' reign of terror ' over civilians
the government is now incorporating the groups into quasi-military units
it comes as one of the @entity4 drug cartel founders was arrested
@entity1 , @entity265 ' or @entity5 , was captured in @entity180
