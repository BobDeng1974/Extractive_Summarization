@entity23 won for @entity24 and team - mate @entity25 was second			2
there was a crowd of over 120,000 people , despite the fact that it took hours to get in and out of the circuit			2
1949 - this race was special for me because it was the first broadcast i ever did			2
i was at @entity34 when @entity35 ( second right ) , in an @entity36 , came down the track , lost control , went barrelling end over end and was thrown in heap at my feet in the commentary box			2
i thought : ‘ @entity44 , what do i say ? ’ i said : ‘ bolster has gone off ’ — a masterpiece of understatement			2
briefing : drivers stand and listen to instructions before the start of the 1949 @entity2 @entity1 1950 - it was the inaugural @entity54 , and it also the first , and so far only , @entity56 meeting			1

he was pressed all the way by @entity89 and spun off six laps before the end , with the @entity13 winning			0
1969 - great friends @entity101 and @entity103 battled side - by - side for 63 of the 84 laps			0
@entity101 saw the rear wing end plate of @entity103 ’s @entity107 was loose and in danger of cutting his tyre , which would have taken him off at enormous speed			0

star @entity115 : @entity116 driving his @entity118 car at the @entity119 winner : @entity121 in action in his @entity123 during his @entity3 victory in 1987 1973 - @entity126 , in his @entity125 , started from fourth , but lost control and took out nine cars on the first lap. he ’d wiped out the whole of @entity132 ’ team and he had to go and hide ! @entity132 , who is not the best man in the world to cross , was very , very angry			1
@entity126 finished fourth when the race re-started			0
and @entity132 never found him ! 1987 - @entity121 ( right ) had terrific vibrations on his car and had to change all four wheels , leaving his @entity123 team - mate @entity139 to streak away			1
@entity121 was 28 seconds behind @entity139 , in an identical car , with 30 laps to go			1
but @entity121 drove out of his skin and , with three laps remaining , he threw @entity139 a dummy at @entity145 , passed him , and won the race			1
hard - fought victory : @entity149 , driving for @entity123 , fought off @entity150 to win in 1994 1994 - there was so much controversy that year , starting at @entity3			1
@entity150 ( near right ) illegally passed championship rival @entity149 on the parade lap. the start was aborted but the @entity157 did it again			0
@entity150 was later black - flagged but he ignored it			0
