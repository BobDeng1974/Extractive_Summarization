@entity0 rescued @entity1 with a late equaliser on saturday , but the @entity3 lost more crucial points in the title race			1
check out @entity7 's player ratings from the @entity8			0
@entity1 @entity9 6 had very little to do all afternoon as @entity10 had took their chances clinically			1
perhaps committed to ground a little too early for the first , allowing @entity12 to lift the ball over him			0
@entity15 6.5 making his first @entity18 start , the @entity16 did little wrong but did n’t get forward as much as he is known to do			1
made a fine slide tackle to prevent @entity20 storming through in first - half stoppage time			0
per @entity22 ( c ) 6 little threat to deal with for long spells of the game but was outjumped by @entity26 for @entity10 ’s second goal and should have been more alert to the threat			1
per @entity22 and @entity30 protest to referee @entity31 after @entity33 's goal @entity34 6.5 did n’t do much wrong considering he was played out of position because of @entity1 ’s debilitating defensive injury crisis			1
is n’t as tall as most centre - backs but was effective in the air when @entity10 threatened aerially			1
@entity39 6.5 did n’t need a second invitation to bomb forward down the left and was there in support of a number of @entity1 assaults in the first - half			1
@entity30 6 fetched and carried between defence and midfield without doing anything spectacular			0
was too lightweight as @entity33 bustled up behind him to score @entity10 ’s equaliser though @entity30 did have a strong case for a foul as he was being wrestled back			1
@entity54 7 had been bright and effective throughout , collecting the ball in deep central positions and beating @entity10 defenders with ease			1
like all @entity1 ’s creative players , was perhaps guilty of playing one pass too many			1
took a nasty knock to the ankle with 20 minutes left and walked straight down the tunnel - another injury worry for @entity64			0
@entity54 receives a yellow card from @entity66 as he leaves the field with an ankle injury @entity69 5.5 not really his afternoon			0
took him until the second half to have a meaningful run forward and struggled to make an impression			0
there were more misplaced passes than normal and he tended to over-complicate , leading to @entity1 ’s moves breaking down ( though he was n’t alone )			1
it was n't @entity69 's day as @entity1 struggled against @entity10 at the @entity8 @entity77 6.5 carried a real threat in the first - half , buzzing around right around the box and came within inches of opening the scoring with a curling shot from outside the box that @entity85 had to tip away at full stretch			1
@entity87 7 dangerous , particularly during the opening exchanges when @entity1 dominated			2
should have scored with a follow - up when @entity85 saved from @entity0 early on but did find the target with a classy step - over to beat his marker and then a precise low shot across @entity85 and in at the far post			2
@entity0 6.5 in the right areas but snuffed out by a rigid @entity10 defence until right near the end			1
should have scored early on after breaking clear through the middle but @entity85 pushed away his shot			0
took his late goal very well though , to the relief of the majority inside the ground			2
@entity1 striker @entity0 ( right ) goes past @entity10 centre back @entity104 substitutes @entity106 ( for @entity30 62 ) 7 a welcome sight for the home fans when he came on for @entity30 with half - an - hour left			1
helped instigate their late siege that eventually yielded a point			2
@entity113 ( for @entity54 68 ) 6.5 received a warm welcome and gave a good account of himself when he replaced the injured @entity54			0
@entity117 in passing and movement			0
not used : @entity120 , @entity121 , @entity122 ( gk ) , @entity123 , @entity124 @entity10 @entity85 7 produced a hat - trick of superb saves to prevent @entity10 being blown away by a gale - force @entity1 start			1
he blocked @entity0 's shot , then readjusted to block an @entity87 follow - up			2
also tipped over a curling effort from @entity77			0
suffered an arm injury and went off at end of first - half			0
@entity10 keeper @entity85 clutches his arm after picking up an injury at the @entity8 @entity138 6 shown up early on by @entity139 , who got beyond him and nearly set up a chance for @entity69			2
booked for a rash tackle on @entity77 , which the @entity16 hurdled in the nick of time			0
@entity146 ( c ) 6.5 @entity147 left him for dead for @entity1 ’s goal but after that was a composed figure as @entity10 absorbed wave after wave of attack			1
@entity104 8 terrific performance to keep @entity1 at bay			2
made clearance after clearance and marshalled the back line as @entity1 tried to pass through it			2
fine slide tackle to deny @entity0 a clear goalscoring opportunity and a chance in the first half that @entity165 caught			2
limped off towards the end			0
@entity104 was outstanding for @entity10 as @entity168 's men held on for a draw @entity170 6.5 had few opportunities to get forward himself but was able to stem @entity1 ’s flow by reading the play and guessing passes and crossed			1
@entity177 7 tireless performance as he was pinned further and further back during the second half			0
shielded the defence and they nearly held out			0
some nice passing as well heading in the opposite direction , especially early on wide to @entity170			0
@entity183 6.5 again , unable to influence things too much in attack but helped cut off some of the supply lines as @entity1 laid siege			2
@entity33 7.5 bustling and powerful , not least when he powered past three defenders ( with a hint of a foul ) before producing an excellent dink over @entity165 for his fourth @entity10 goal			1
@entity33 ( right ) shuts down @entity54 during a bustling and powerful performance for @entity10 @entity20 6 not as effective as on previous afternoons and it took a good 30 minutes for him to get a chance to run at @entity1			1
creativity slowly turned into defensive duty as the game wore on			0
@entity200 6 barely noticed going forward as @entity1 kept him well and truly contained			2
late replacement for @entity202 , who pulled his hamstring in the warm - up			0
saw little of the ball until he outjumped @entity22 to power home a header early in the second - half			0
@entity26 celebrates after powering home a header to give his side a 2 - 1 lead substitutes : @entity214 ( for @entity215 ) 7 made a number of good saves to keep @entity1 at bay , especially to tip over a @entity147 header @entity220 ( for @entity26 62 ) 6 a quiet half - hour cameo as the ball was largely down the other end			1
@entity224 ( for @entity104 84 ) not used : @entity225 , @entity226 , @entity227			0
