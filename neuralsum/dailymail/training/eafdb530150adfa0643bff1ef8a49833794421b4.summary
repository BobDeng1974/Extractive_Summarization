by @entity0 published : 08:53 est , 31 january 2014 updated : 10:23 est , 31 january 2014 a taxpayer - funded website which allows drug dealers to get illegal substances tested for quality has provoked a backlash			1
the service called @entity8 ( @entity9 ) was set up to enable health professionals and police to check the ingredients of suspect pills and powders			2
it also offers people advice on how to start taking drugs and safeguards to consider when getting high			1
controversial : users can submit drugs to @entity21 for testing , in complete anonymity , then log on to the site to see the quality of their drugs the site , paid for by @entity28 , has now been launched nationally in an attempt to combat health fears sparked by the explosion in the number of so - called legal highs			1
but it has sparked anger from politicians who have accused it of diverting much - needed cash from frontline @entity40 services and also providing a de facto kitemark of quality which would be exploited by drug dealers as a ' marketing tool ' to boost their profits			1
substances sent anonymously to @entity21 are analysed to identify their active ingredients , which are listed on the website alongside a photo of the substance and the packaging it came in			1
conservative health spokesman in the @entity54 @entity53 told @entity56 's today programme : ' it ’s not just legal highs that this website allows people to test			1
it ’s also illegal drugs as well			2
' it ’s clearly open to abuse by drugs pushers who can use this , because it ’s in the public domain , as a marketing tool to publicly advertise the purity of their substances and therefore increase their prices			1
backlash : @entity21 has provoked a fierce backlash for enabling drug dealers to test their own stash ( @entity80 picture ) analysis : included on the substances listed on the website was a fruit pastille coated in @entity85 - which came back positive for the hallucinogen ' if you go on to the website , you ’ll find there are brand names on there , there ’s packaging on there , and it ’s heroin , crack , methamphetamine , all these sorts of substances that people are sending in to be tested			1
and it includes even advice on how to snort , inject and smoke those substances			0
@entity21 aims to reduce harm to drug - users by providing rapid information about substances on the streets			1
a total of 175 samples have been received and tested by @entity8 project			0
the project cost £ 103,000 to set up and has a budget of £ 90,500 a year - less than 1 per cent of the overall substance misuse budget			1
of the samples sent to the project , 84 per cent were new psychoactive substances ( @entity115 ) , of which 16 per cent were synthetic cannabinoids and 31 per cent amphetamine - like stimulants			2
a spokesman for the project said : ' @entity21 does not test for purity of a sample , and therefore can not provide any information as to the relative " cleanliness " of a drug			2
' what the system does do is enable individuals who have purchased substances believing them to be legal to ascertain the true content			0
' of the samples collected to date , bought as legal highs , 27 per cent were found to contain controlled drugs			2
' ' i think it ’s quite clear that the @entity136 government have given up the fight against drugs			0
that ’s why they ’ve established this website			0
' when it ’s costing hundreds of thousands of pounds , i would rather see that cash reinvested back into the frontline @entity40 services that are in crisis at the moment here in @entity28			0
' included on the substances listed on the website was a fruit pastille coated in the hallucinogen lsd			0
the sample came back positive for @entity85 , or @entity85			0
the project , which cost £ 103,000 to set up and has a budget of £ 90,500 a year , has also raised questions about the dangers posed by sending drugs via the mail system			1
users are warned on the website : ' the mail system prohibits the posting of controlled drugs and narcotics			2
do not knowingly submit samples of controlled drugs via the postal mechanism			0
' recent years have seen increasing amounts of new substances entering the @entity170 drug market , manufactured in labs abroad to mimic the effects of known narcotics while sidestepping the law by changing their precise chemical make - up			0
the unfamiliarity of the substances involved has introduced new risks , as users and health workers can be caught out by unexpected and damaging side - effects			2
@entity183 of @entity28 told today : ' essentially , the @entity8 project was established as a consequence of a call from clinicians within emergency departments , ambulance and other health services , along with the criminal justice service , where they were being presented with individuals who had taken substances but were unaware of what they were			2
' the clinician would be unaware of what the substance was			0
they did n’t know how to treat			0
' over the last few years , we ’ve seen a real sea - change in the drugs market			0
we refer to the term " new psychoactive substances " because the term " legal highs " can denote a degree of safety , and actually we are finding that there are a number of adverse effects that people are experiencing			1
' taking drugs : the publicly - funded @entity8 website offers advice for people who are thinking about starting to take drugs ms @entity183 added : ' we do not specify purity of substances , what we do is test a sample that has been submitted and explicitly name all of the substances that are contained within it			1
it ’s not a purity measure			0
' ms @entity183 said 52 per cent of the samples sent to @entity21 were bought as legal highs , but 27 per cent of those actually contained illegal substances			1
evidence from across the @entity170 showed that , even within a single batch of substances brought into the country from @entity236 or @entity237 , the actual chemical make - up can vary widely .			0
