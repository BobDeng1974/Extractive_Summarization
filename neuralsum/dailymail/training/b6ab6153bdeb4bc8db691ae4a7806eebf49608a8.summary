a woman who suffered an extreme allergic reaction to eyelash extensions was forced to spend five hours peeling them off her face after the salon refused to remove them			1
@entity7 , 42 , was left with severely blistered skin for weeks after suffering a severe , painful allergic reaction to the glue used to apply eyelash extensions			1
she claims her local beauty salon in @entity13 failed to perform a patch test - where a small part of the substance is placed on the skin more than 24 hours beforehand to check for an allergic reaction			1
although mrs @entity7 , a primary school teaching assistant , told the beautician she had never had extensions before , she says she was not given an allergy test			2
@entity7 was left with severely blistered skin for weeks after suffering a severe , painful allergic reaction to the glue used to apply eyelash extensions she woke up the following morning with severely irritated , stinging and bloodshot eyes			1
when she returned to the salon , she claims she was told this was normal , but her symptoms grew worse , with blisters forming around her eye line and a rash spreading across her face			0
she told @entity33 : ' the whole experience was harrowing			0
my gp advised me to go back to the salon and ask them to remove the extensions , but they would n’t do it and recommended i go home and try to remove them myself			1
' it took me five hours to work them free using nothing but soap and water and it was an excruciatingly painful experience , but even after that the rash and irritation carried on getting worse			0
mrs @entity7 woke up the next morning with severely irritated , stinging and bloodshot eyes ' it was only after my doctor put me on a course of steroids and anti-histamines that they gradually subsided			1
' you go to a salon to make you feel good about yourself but this destroyed my confidence and left me with very painful injuries			0
' mrs @entity7 now fears the incident may have triggered a lifelong intolerance to adhesives , after she subsequently suffered another reaction to household superglue			2
the insurer is refusing to cover the beauty salon in @entity69 , claiming it broke the terms of its policy by not carrying out the patch test			0
this means mrs @entity7 's only option for compensation is to sue the salon directly – which would likely put it out of business			1
she said : ' i think it ’s disgusting that people in my situation are being denied compensation for negligence because insurers are refusing to pay out			0
' mrs @entity7 's lawyers at @entity85 have seen an influx of enquiries from women who have suffered adverse reactions from eye extension glue			2
her lawyer , @entity91 , said : ' @entity7 ’s story is a strong warning to anyone visiting a hair or beauty salon to always ensure that they have a patch test , even if it causes delays			2
' it ’s very worrying that the insurance company wo n’t indemnify their client , when the whole reason salons take out insurance is to protect themselves from exactly this kind of incident			0
' although @entity7 and victims in similar circumstances are well within their right to seek compensation for their injuries , the pay - out they would receive from pursuing a claim could easily put these small enterprises out of business			0
