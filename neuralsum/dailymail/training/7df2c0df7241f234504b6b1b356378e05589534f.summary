it was once described as a ' building of world significance ' and was seen as such a striking example of modern architecture that it was given the highest possible protection for buildings in @entity8			1
in its 1960s heyday the entire hierarchy of the @entity12 attended a ceremony to mark the laying of the foundation stone at @entity16 near @entity17 in @entity18 before it was to become a key centre for the training of @entity22 priests			1
but 50 years on the seminary is a ghost of its former grandeur , abandoned and desolate with the once decadent walls covered with graffiti and its distinctive corridors and halls littered with rubbish and overgrown weeds			1
today the abandoned seminary is mostly occupied by the homeless , alcoholics and drug addicts			0
winding staircases have been partially destroyed , doorways and walls left to rot and crumble , and discarded stone and litter is all over the floors of the vast site			0
most of the woodwork and glass has now disappeared but evidence of the distinctive architecture remains			0
now its only visitors are urban explorers , desperate to reinvigorate a building that was once seen as so important in brutalist architecture			1
the building was officially opened in 1964 after it was built to replace the @entity22 seminary previously housed in @entity74 in @entity75 , which was destroyed by a fire in 1946			2
in 1964 archbishop @entity77 laid the foundation stone at @entity34 , before the entire hierarchy of the @entity12			1
urban explorers have captured the destruction of the building , with corridors littered with discarded stone and walls left to rot and crumble the building in @entity18 in @entity8 has been praised for its modernist design and was afforded the highest protection as a category a building graffiti now covers many walls at @entity34 but there are attempts being made to restore it to its former glory and appreciate the architecture it had a capacity of 100 students but was never full as the number of students joining the priesthood started to decline in the 1960s			1
the building has been praised for its modernist design by @entity108 and @entity108 of architecture firm @entity108 in the early 1960s			2
and it was later described as a modern ' building of world significance ' becoming one of only 42 post-war buildings in @entity8 to be listed at @entity114 , the highest level of protection for a building of ' special architectural or historic interest '			2
after it was opened the seminary became part of @entity121 and was used as a training ground for young priests			2
it closed in 1980 and was briefly used as a drug rehabilitation centre until it was shut down in 1987			1
since then it has been unused , despite attempts to reinvigorate it and try to turn it into something resembling its former glory			0
the site of @entity16 in @entity18 is surrounded by trees and close to @entity135 , which was targeted by arsonists in 1995 a shot of the building when it was still in use reveals the brutalist architecture which led it to be classed as of world architectural significance the building was used as training ground for @entity12 priests			1
pictured standing outside the seminary are ( left to right ) monsignor @entity148 , @entity149 of @entity150 , archbishop @entity77 , @entity152 , @entity153 of @entity18 and the @entity154 it has been occupied by the homeless and luckily escaped an arson attack at nearby @entity158 in 1995			2
but despite being abandoned and on the cusp of ruin , the building has still retained its lure for lovers of architecture			0
urban explorers have constantly visited the site during the almost 30 years it has sat abandoned			1
in 2005 it was voted @entity8 's best modern building by the readers of @entity171			0
one explorer , who did n't wish to be named , said : ' it 's such an incredible structure and it seems mad that it 's just been lying empty for all this time			0
' just by walking around , you can tell that it was once this grand building			2
it 's fascinating to see what has happened to the place over the years			0
@entity108 and @entity108 , who have both since died , designed @entity183 's seminary in @entity18 which is due to be redeveloped @entity184 and weeds cover the walls of @entity183 's in @entity8 , making it a shadow of its former glory as a thriving part of @entity121 the site has been abandoned for almost 30 years after a brief spell when it was used as a drug rehabilitation centre until 1989 when it closed @entity16 in @entity18 still attracts urban explorers wowed by its architecture and was voted @entity8 's best modern building in 2005 ' i really hope that someone can salvage this after it being dormant for so long			1
' there have been several attempts to reinvigorate life into the building with the most recent effort being by @entity75 based public arts project @entity206			0
they appear to be the most likely group to restore the the seminary to something resembling its former glory , having raised £ 5 million so far for a project promising to turn it into a ' vibrant arts landscape '			0
however this will never be seen by the designers of the building who have died since it was constructed .			0
