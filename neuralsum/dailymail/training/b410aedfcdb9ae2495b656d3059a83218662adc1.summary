she also believes new incentives for businesses to take over empty shops could help revitalise @entity76 ’s ailing high streets			1
the 35 - year - old has two full - time members of staff and is hoping to expand her present - buying company by taking on more			2
she will now seriously consider hiring younger workers to take advantage of the new incentive			0
miss @entity100 ’s company , @entity104 , is an online business with a shop in @entity102 , @entity102			2
if she takes on someone under 21 on a salary of £ 12,000 , under the new rules she could save £ 500 a year in @entity127 contributions			1
she said : ‘ this could certainly help us in the future as we grow as i would certainly like to employ more young people			0

the fact something like this is being introduced nationally is a great idea			0
up and down the country , tragically , the @entity166 is changing and there are tons of empty shops where we live in @entity102			2
‘ this is great for the community as if businesses can take over then the high streets can thrive			2

local authorities will be urged to get rid of high - value , vacant properties			1
the proceeds will go to giving councils an extra £ 300million to borrow to build 10,000 new , affordable homes and regenerate rundown estates			2
council tenants who want to move home so they can be closer to work will also get help			0
@entity16 said : ‘ we want to regenerate some of our most rundown urban housing estates			0
councils will sell off the most expensive social housing , so they can house many more families for the same money			0
’ he added : ‘ we are going to give working people in social housing a priority right to move if they need to for a job			0
’ @entity199 chairman sir @entity198 said councils had lobbied for the removal of the borrowing cap			0
‘ the easing of restrictions on housing investment does not go as far as we would like , but it does show that our call for more local flexibility to drive economic growth has been recognised			0

universities in @entity219 will be allowed to recruit as many students as they want from 2015 , the chancellor announced yesterday			2
the government is axing the limit on places , which means institutions will be able to expand without incurring fines			0
the overhaul will be funded through the sale of more student debt to private companies , amounting to £ 5.5billion over five years			0
this will fund students ’ maintenance and tuition fee loans			0
@entity16 said the move was necessary as around 60,000 young people with the grades to study for a degree miss out on places every year due to an ‘ arbitrary cap ’			1
he added : ‘ that makes no sense when we have a far lower proportion of people going to university than even the @entity246 , let alone countries like @entity248			0
’ universities minister @entity249 said : ‘ removing the student numbers cap will free universities to recruit the students they want and give people far more choice over where to study			0
