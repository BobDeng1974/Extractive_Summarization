' he believes , and he is innocent			0
charged : officer @entity65 ( left ) is charged with murder for the fatal beating			0
cpl @entity68 ( right ) faces lesser charges , but is still implicated in the death killed : @entity101 , 37 , who suffered from schizophrenia , was horrifically beaten to death by police after reports of a homeless man looking into parked cars led to his probe @entity48 district attorney @entity109 said during the hearing that @entity65 ' actions - snapping on latex gloves , making a fist and threatening to take on @entity25 - would have led anyone to fear they were about to get beaten by police			1
' any person , any creature on this earth would have fear at that point , ' mr @entity109 told the court			0

moving forward : judge @entity89 explains why he believes two @entity9 police officers should remain charged with the death of a mentally ill homeless man last summer weapon : attorney @entity109 holds up a taser similar to the one allegedly used as a blunt - force weapon against mr @entity25 during wednesday 's trial mr @entity85 , @entity65 ' attorney , said during the hearing that the video - which was introduced by the prosecution - shows that his client made a conditional threat during his conversation with mr @entity25 , stating he wanted the man to start listening and following police orders , such as sitting with his legs stretched out and providing his name to officers			1
' all that @entity101 had to do was simply comply , ' mr @entity85 said			1
' officer @entity65 just lifts him up , he 's going to arrest him			2

' ' officer @entity65 did n't do anything that should or could kill @entity101 , ' mr @entity85 said , pointing out that his client is often seen on the video at the man 's feet			1

after mr @entity25 lost consciousness and was taken to a hospital , he was taken off life support and died five days later			0
the coroner 's office found that mr @entity25 died from compression of his chest that made it difficult for him to breathe and deprived his brain of oxygen , and facial injuries stemming from his confrontation with law enforcement			2
in court , mr @entity214 , @entity68 's attorney , challenged those findings , noting that testimony by a paramedic who treated mr @entity25 at the scene indicates that he was breathing , although with difficulty , during the confrontation			2
shocking : footage from a bus station shows officers beating @entity101 as he begged for his father subduing : @entity25 screamed out in pain as he was being tasered mr @entity214 also defended his client 's use of the @entity199 on mr @entity25 , who was still struggling and resisting officers ' efforts to handcuff him , and said @entity68 only swung the taser at mr @entity25 ' hand when the man made an effort to grab the weapon			1
' to call that a crime is to effectively handcuff our police officers out in the field from dealing with any combative suspect , ' mr @entity214 said			2
the hearing in a @entity243 courtroom was marked by lengthy testimony from medical experts and graphic photos of mr @entity25 ' injuries , including multiple bruises and a bloodied eye , while he was lying on the autopsy table			0
attorneys repeatedly played portions of the grainy surveillance video , which was paired with audio from digital recorders worn by some of the officers who were present and which brought some of mr @entity25 ' supporters to tears and prompted them to leave the courtroom			2
the incident last july prompted an ongoing @entity264 investigation to determine if mr @entity25 ' civil rights were violated , an internal probe by the city , protests by residents and an effort to recall three @entity9 councilmembers that is slated for next month 's ballot			1
