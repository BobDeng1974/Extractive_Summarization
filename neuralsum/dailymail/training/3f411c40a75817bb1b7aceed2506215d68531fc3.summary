hundreds of sex offenders are escaping with slap - on - the - wrist punishments for ‘ abhorrent ’ crimes including grooming and assaulting children			1
figures compiled by the @entity6 reveal that perverts have been let off with cautions even when targeting those aged under 13			2
the law states that a child aged 12 or under is incapable of consenting to any sexual activity – with perpetrators facing a maximum 14 years in jail			2
but police have given out 437 cautions for the offence over the past five years			2
let off : more than 400 cautions have been given to offenders for sex with under - 13s ( posed by model ) the ‘ soft ’ punishment , sparing the offender a court appearance , is used in about one in six cases dealt with by the authorities			1
police and prosecutors are also dealing lightly with those guilty of grooming children for sex , despite public outrage over gangs targeting vulnerable youngsters			2
some 66 such crimes resulted in a caution between 2009 and 2013 – a shocking 18 per cent of the cases where action was taken			2
campaigners and mps said the revelations were ‘ appalling ’			0
@entity44 mp @entity43 , who unearthed the figures , said paedophiles were being spared the ‘ full force of the law ’ , adding : ‘ it is completely unacceptable to give cautions for sexual activity with children under the age of 13			1
mp @entity43 : ' it is completely unacceptable ' ' there are no mitigating factors and no excuses			1
they should go before a judge			0
’ @entity61 , of the @entity62 , said : ‘ even those well aware of how much cautions are being overused will be sickened			0
cautions for major sex offences and paedophiles is completely unacceptable			1
’ the @entity68 said some decisions to issue a caution may have been taken to avoid a child having to give evidence in court			1
but it added that this was a damning indictment of the justice system			0
the charity ’s @entity78 said : ‘ a custodial sentence for serious sexual offences sends a very clear message that society will not accept their behaviour in any way			0
it also reflects the lifelong damage that sexual abuse can have on children and young people			0
‘ a prison sentence can also mean the offender is given therapy to ensure they understand the impact of their behaviour and to reduce their risk of reoffending			0
’ there has long been controversy over the use of cautions for other types of sex offences			0
figures released to mr @entity43 , a campaigner against soft justice , show there were 7,057 such punishments in a five - year period			1
but the disclosure relating to those who have assaulted under - 13s is particularly shocking			0
normally , officials explain the use of cautions for sex crimes as applying in cases such as a 17 - year - old having sex with a 14 or 15 - year - old			1
prosecutors may decide not to take the case to court because the act was consensual			0
@entity125 justice minister @entity124 , who released the figures to mr @entity43 , said : ‘ all sexual offences are abhorrent			1
’ @entity128 , @entity44 justice minister , said the law was now being changed to ban the use of cautions for serious sexual offences			1
he said : ‘ under this government , sex offenders are more likely to be locked up , and for longer … we ’ve banned the use of cautions for serious offences and we ’re now enshrining this in law			1
’ in a speech earlier this week , justice secretary @entity141 said the number of sex offenders was one of the ‘ biggest challenges ’ facing the courts , with a ‘ fairly rapid increase ’ in the number in jails			0
he added : ‘ more have been arriving in our prisons and they have been staying there for longer than the typical offender			0

some ' soft ' punishments may be to avoid children giving evidence at trial
but campaigners outraged at use of cautions , used in one in six cases
@entity44 mp @entity43 : paedophiles being spared ' full force of the law '
