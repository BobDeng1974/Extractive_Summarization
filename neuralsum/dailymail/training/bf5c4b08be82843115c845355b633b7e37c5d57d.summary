before : angela with her normal straight hair memories of my @entity4 childhood are speckled with images of my mother , wafting around the house before a night out , her head laden with heated rollers and pins , like a perfumed porcupine			1
dynasty and @entity14 were the tv shows of the day and hair was big			1
the heated rollers were @entity19 's weapons in her life - long battle to tease a little @entity22 va - va - voom into her naturally straight tresses			1
she stayed loyal to her trusty @entity24 over the next 30 years , even as big hair fell out of fashion			1
in fact , it was that trusty box of rollers that elicited the biggest pang of nostalgia when i cleared out her things following her death , at the age of 81 , in august			2
how could i possibly throw them away ? i 'm glad i did n't ; big hair is back			1
with the @entity38 and @entity39 sporting big , bouncy , curly styles that would make @entity42 - proud , heated rollers are essential again			1
but how would @entity19 's rollers compete against the latest , 2013 versions ? i put them to the test			1
on a roll : @entity48 wearing the @entity50 rollers and then immediately after they were taken out the @entity50 effect : the final result this set of 20 rollers - ten large for ' extra volume curves ' and ten medium for ' extreme curl ' - are stored and heated simultaneously on four lines of horizontal metal bars in a case the size of a large handbag			1
butterfly clips are attached round the rollers so they get a blast of heat , too			2
an led light goes red when the rollers are ready			2
@entity69 : the rollers have a lovely velvet feel and take only two minutes to heat			2
there are plenty of them for my thick hair			2
the clips do get a little hot to handle , but thankfully they do n't burn your head			2
rolled out easily after 15 minutes			0
result : delivered a nice overall bounce rather than cascading waves			0
not for lovers of really big hair if yours is quite long			1
but a good , mid-priced buy			0
best for : thick hair			2
3/5 budget : @entity90 @entity91 , the brand beloved of my mum			2
they have certainly come a long way			0
only eight medium sized and four larger rollers , pictured right , each with a wax core that , according to the blurb , helps retain a high heat , setting curls faster			1
each roller fits on a vertical bar so they heat simultaneously			0
@entity69 : velvety and bristle - free , these rollers took nearly 15 minutes to heat			1
there 's no indicator light so i had to guess			2
even then , they still did n't feel too hot and it was fiddly getting the hair clips in place , resulting in some minor temper issues			1
result : they give a tightly flicked curl rather than a cascading wave , but a reasonable price			0
best for : budget buyers 2/5 the set has 12 large , soft - to - the - touch , thermo - ceramic rollers that , so it 's claimed , give a smooth , shiny finish			1
like the @entity128 brand , the rollers line up on horizontal heated bars within the case , so they are easy to store			2
@entity69 : they take about three minutes to heat - a dot on top of each roller turns from red to white when they are ready - and they fasten into hair with easy - to - handle butterly clips			1
result : produces long waves rather than full curls - but since the rollers are quite large the overall look is quite soft			1
my hair had a nice bounce but nobody 's going to invite me to join @entity149 any time soon			1
best for : clumsy fingers 3/5 these are the lightest and most portable			0
twelve medium - sized rollers come complete with easy - to - use metal clips in a neat little zip - up storage case			1
@entity69 : unfortunately you can heat up only six of the rollers - on vertical bars in the bottom of the case - at a time			1
since the appliance takes ten minutes to reach a decent temperature to begin with , then a further six minutes to heat each set of rollers , getting the full set ready tested my patience			2
at least the rollers felt quite hot once they were in			2
result : oh dear - this resulted in straggly rats ' tails , rather than big bouncy curls , and they dropped out fairly quickly			1
redeemed only by the nice case and price			0
best for : travelling light 1/5 it may look like a small pudding bowl with a plug on the end but this , apparently , is the new dawn in hair rollers			1
and it is known as a pod : you pop rollers in individually and , thanks to the wonders of induction , they heat up in eight seconds			0
when the pod is ready , the word diva lights up - a lovely touch			0
but it 's not cheap : you buy the rollers separately ; they come in three sizes , and at nearly Â£ 30 for four that 's serious cash			1
@entity69 : they feel heavy and hot on my head - just wearing four gave me a headache			0
the comb clips were a bit scratchy , too			0
big , generous waves fell around my face and i saw myself reborn as @entity209			0
best for : @entity211 results 5/5			0
another one to rely on the pod system , the @entity213 rollers are placed in one at a time and when ready to use eight seconds later , the pod bleeps and a blue light flashes			0
better value than the diva as you get 14 rollers - two large , eight medium and four small			1
@entity69 : it was a real grapple with the grip combs , they reminded me of those arcade games where you try to grab a toy with a giant claw			0
the flex is very short so you have to sit next to a plug point while they heat up , which is irritating			0
result : i do like the effects			0
my hair is big and bouncy with some strong , springy curls pooling on my shoulders			1
best for : those with lots of power points			0
3/5 well these are very pretty to look at , see below , - two large , two medium and six small black and pink @entity213 rollers in a rather fetching pink case			1
you know they 've heated up when a dot on the rim of the rollers turns from green to dark grey - not an easy colour change to spot			1
during and after : @entity256 's rollers are a pain to use but delivered some nicely flicked out waves @entity69 : these take six minutes to cook and the thick bristles feel like rolling a loo brush in your hair			1
i also struggled threading the pin through the rim of the rollers			0
@entity267 : delivered some nicely flicked out waves - think @entity269 in @entity270			0
the curls passed the tug - them - and - see - if - they - fall - out test			1
but they were such a pain to use			0
best for : those with manual dexterity			0
2/5 the purse - aching price of a budget airline ticket to the @entity284 , this set is high - tech - the soft - grip rollers heat from cold to 130c in four seconds , while remaining cool to the touch			1
only the core of the roller is heated , rather than the surface			0
an electronic beep and light alert you when each roller is ready			0
@entity69 : the problem with pod rollers is that you ca n't get into a rhythm			2
you have to keep stopping and starting to heat each one			0
@entity267 : i love the overall effect - a head of loose waves , which kink and curl rather fetchingly around the shoulders - very @entity38			1
best for : lottery winners and @entity306			0
4/5 compared to modern rollers , @entity19 's old ones are like an instrument of torture			2
with their spikes and surgical - style pins , i 'm tempted to take a paracetamol to ease the pain of putting them in			2
touchingly dated : they took a long time to heat up , but @entity19 's old rollers produced a nice ringlet effect @entity69 : heated up on vertical posts within a compact case , they took an hour - yes , a whole hour - to warm up			1
though you do get a lot of rollers for your money : six big ones , ten medium sized and four small			2
the biggest were only the same size as the medium rollers in most of the modern sets			0
result : actually , the effect was really nice and touchingly dated since with so many smaller rollers it produced quite a ringlet effect that brushed out into beautiful waves			0
but they needed at least 40 minutes to produce a curl			0
my mum always liked it when i had curly hair - she railed against the fact i blow - dried it straight			1
so i hope this would have made her happy			0
best for : an afternoon of nostalgia			0

@entity48 's mum loved va - va - voom tresses - even when they were n't in style
but with @entity38 and @entity39 sporting bouncy curls , big hair is back
will @entity48 's mum 's rollers compete with the latest versions ?
