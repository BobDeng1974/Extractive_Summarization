it is well known that chimpanzees use tools , much like humans			0
but now experts have found that @entity6 chimps in @entity7 have a favourite tool set for catching their staple food of ants			1
they search far and wide to find a spindly shrub with straight shoots , called @entity14 , which makes the ideal tool to hunt aggressive army ants , new research reveals			1
they search far and wide to find a spindly shrub with straight shoots , called @entity14 , which makes the ideal tool to hunt aggressive army ants ( pictured ) the plant provides the animals with two different types of tool - a thicker shoot for ‘ digging ’ and a more slender tool for ' dipping '			1
when they have found an army ant colony , chimpanzees will dig into the nest with the first tool to aggravate the insects			1
they then dip the second tool into the nest , causing the angry ants to swarm up it			1
once the slender shoot is covered in ants , the chimpanzees pull it out and wipe their fingers along it , scooping up the ants until they have a substantial handful that they eat in one motion			1
this technique , called ant dipping , was previously believed to be a last resort for the hungry apes , which they only exploited when their preferred food of fruit could n't be found			2
but the latest study , based on over ten years of data , shows that army ants are a staple in the chimpanzee diet which are eaten all year round regardless of available sources of fruit			1
it has been known that chimpanzees use tools like humans for over 50 years			0
in 1960 , @entity64 witnessed two chimps using twigs to fish for termites in the ground			2
this was the first time that an animal was observed to make a tool and use it for a specific purpose , other than humans			2
it was later found that the @entity77 chimps use twigs , leaves and rocks in nine different ways to feed , drink , clean themselves , reach other objects and to fashion weapons			0
in communities outside @entity77 national park , communities make different tools			0
chimpanzees make sponges by chewing leaves and dipping them into puddles of water so they can use them as drinking vessels			0
they have been observed using sticks and rocks to smash fruit and shells			0
adult males sometimes hurl rocks and sticks like make - shift spears to intimidate rivals			0
this study says that chimps use shoots from @entity14 to hunt aggressive army ants in a specific way			1
it is thought that the behaviour is passed from one generation to the next and is learned by young chimpanzees			1
this may be because the ants are a source of protein and fats , according to @entity121 from the @entity122 , who published the findings in the @entity125			0
‘ @entity127 dipping is a remarkable feat of problem - solving on the part of chimpanzees , ’ said dr @entity121			0
‘ if they tried to gather ants from the ground with their hands , they would end up horribly bitten with very little to show for it			0
but by using a tool set , preying on these social insects may prove as nutritionally lucrative as hunting a small mammal - a solid chunk of protein			2
’ if @entity14 is nowhere to be found , the chimps will fashion tools from other plants , and they spend a long time looking for their preferred shrub			1
previous research has shown that chimpanzees will select longer tools for faster , more aggressive types of army ants			1
the average ' dipping ' tool length across the study was 25 inches ( 64cm ) , but some were selected that were 30 inches ( 76cm ) long			1
dr @entity121 is investigating how chimpanzees acquire knowledge of such sophisticated techniques			0
‘ scientists have been working on ruling out simple environmental and genetic explanations for group differences in behaviours , such as tool use , and the evidence is pointing strongly towards it being cultural , ’ she explained			0
‘ they probably learn tool use behaviours from their mother and others in the group when they are young			0
’ the research for the ant - dipping study - which took place in @entity7 's @entity168 - proved challenging , as the chimpanzees were not used to people			1
when they have found an army ant colony , chimpanzees will dig into the nest with the first tool to aggravate the insects			1
they then dip the second tool into the nest , causing the angry ants to swarm up it the team acted like archaeologists , studying ' exploited ' ants nests to measure abandoned tool sets and ‘ sifting through faeces for ant heads ’			2
to study these illusive creatures further , dr @entity121 set up cameras to film the chimps using the tools extensive video footage of the chimpanzees and their tool use			2
she even filmed a chimp making a tool to investigate the camera			2
dr @entity121 said : ‘ this study is part of a big ongoing research project			0
the next stages will involve looking at social opportunities to learn : how much time do youngsters spend within arm 's length of other individuals , how much time do they spend close to their mother , as well as innate predispositions to explore and engage with objects			2
’ ‘ by studying our closest living relatives we gain a window into the evolutionary past which allows us to shed light on the origins of human technology and material culture , ' she added .			0

@entity6 chimps use @entity14 shoots to hunt army ants
they use thicker shoot for ' digging ' and a more slender tool for ' dipping '
chimps first aggravate the ants then wait for them to climb up the slender stalk , so they can collect them easily and eat them without being attacked
it 's thought the behaviour is social and passed down generations of chimps
the fascinating behaviour was filmed in @entity7 's @entity241
chimps use extra long shoots if they think the ants are especially *viscious*
