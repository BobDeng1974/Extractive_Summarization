a former detective who investigated the former mp said he believes he would have confessed to his guilt if he had been put on trial			1
the claims emerged as the mp 's autobiography reveals he was friends with the late @entity13 @entity14 - also accused of being a serial paedophile			1
friends : sir @entity2 revealed in his autiobiography how he had met @entity14 at a medieval banquet when he joined in communal singing in 1977			1
he impressed the late dj so much he was invited to appear on his @entity20 show @entity22 according to the @entity23 , @entity2 wrote in his 1977 autobiography @entity24 : ' i once attended a medieval banquet at @entity28 , @entity29 , along with @entity14			1
when i joined the community singing , @entity14 blurted out , ' you 've got a nice voice there @entity34 , you must come on my programme ! ' ' that 's how i ended up singing ' she 's a @entity38 from @entity29 ' on @entity22			1
he continued : ' @entity14 openly admits that his work as a disc jockey is a joke , but his record of public service and charity must be unequalled			1
' it was revealed yesterday how prosecutors missed three chances to convict @entity2 for indecent assault , despite the fact detectives 40 years ago were convinced he was guilty			1
his original file was passed back to the police by the @entity53 ( @entity53 ) in 1970 , arguing the allegations were too old , not corroborated and made by boys with dubious characters			0
today , a retired officer told how he was drafted in to investigate @entity2 a year earlier , when the @entity59 force was absorbed into @entity60			1
he said that another detective who previously worked on the case , @entity59 - based @entity61 , had warned him his attempts to expose @entity2 had been ‘ blocked ’ at every turn by influential friends of the politician			1
instead , mr @entity61 wanted a new officer - one not already known in the town - to take over and have another attempt			0
the ex-detective , who asked not to be named , said : ' he said they had made numerous attempts to investigate @entity2 but was getting obstructed by dignitaries			1
he said you are unknown officers and may fare better			0
' over the following months , he compiled a dossier on the politician which he believed proved his guilt			0
he said : ' he did n’t deny certain things			1
he admitted he spanked them - his last words were ‘ this will kill my mother ’			2
' we had enough , i think			0
to be quite honest i think if it had gone to trial he would have had admitted it			1
it suggested he was scared			0
' missed opportunities : both @entity91 ( @entity91 ) and the @entity92 ( @entity92 ) said if @entity2 , right , had been accused today he would be charged and prosecuted in a striking similarity to @entity14 , bachelor @entity2 lived with his mother @entity96 until her death in 1994			1
when he became mayor of @entity59 in the 1960s , she was his lady mayoress			0
the retired detective , who was based at @entity101 , said that , just as he was completing the investigation , he was forced to hand over the file to senior officers from force hq - and never saw or heard of it again			2
shortly afterwards the @entity53 marked it ‘ no further action ’			2
meanwhile , a former special branch officer claimed the file eventually landed in his office because it was so politically sensitive			0
@entity111 , based at @entity112 at the time , said : ' you can imagine them saying : ‘ what are we going to do with this ? it ’s a bit of a political hot potato , send it to special branch , get it buried ’			0
' he said he eventually received a call in around 1977 - when @entity2 ’s @entity125 was hoping to form a pact with the @entity128 government - from @entity129 ordering him to send it to @entity131 via a personal courier			1
he added : ' it ’s plain to see why @entity129 wanted the file			0
@entity2 was being investigated for a position at the top table			1

just months later , he says , he was forced to perform a sex act on @entity2 – known to the pupils as ‘ the fat man ’ – after being ‘ summoned ’ from his dormitory in the dead of night			1
he said : ‘ a member of staff came up and took me from the room			0
he took me into this flat			0
the fat man was on the bed and another kid was there too			0
‘ we were told to go back afterwards to our rooms , not to wake anybody else up and have a good breakfast in the morning			0
‘ it was a dreadful , dreadful experience but i was so confused i did n’t tell anyone until much later			0
but the school was rife with this type of behaviour and there were all sorts of sexual things going on			2
’ after the abuse , he begged staff for his own room			2
when he got his wish , he slept with a chair against the door so no - one could get in			0
mr @entity137 said that it was only when he was in his teens and saw photos of the high - profile politician in a newspaper that he realised who his abuser was			2
he said : ‘ it was definitely @entity2			2
the truth is he was a child abuser and targeted vulnerable children			1
people need to know this is what he was – he was a paedophile			0

two alleged victims of sir @entity2 are considering legal action against @entity59 council for abuse suffered in a boys ’ hostel			1

they say they were molested as teenagers by @entity2 while living at @entity204 hostel			2
the council says it is looking into its involvement in the hostel , which was set up by @entity2 in 1962			2
it was largely set up using cash from the local @entity210 , but was also given a council grant on its foundation , according to the @entity213			0
however , in 1965 the council refused to give a larger grant - thought to be around £ 700 - and the hostel shut			0
one of the alleged victims , now 67 , made allegations of abuse to police at the time			1
the second had not previously come forward , taking the tally of people who claim they were abused by @entity2 to 13			2
a spokesman for @entity197 said it is investigating the extent of the council ’s involvement			0
@entity227 , director of corporate services at the council , said : ' the sexual abuse of children is an awful crime carried about by the worst kind of criminals			0
' @entity204 was a privately - run care home and we have contacted the solicitor quoted in the media to clarify the details behind the claims being made against the council			0
' we encourage anyone with allegations to contact @entity91 so they can be looked into immediately			0

former detective says @entity2 ' did *n't* deny certain things '
