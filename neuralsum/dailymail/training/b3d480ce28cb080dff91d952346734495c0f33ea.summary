speculators are offering ' no - win , no - fee ' deals as they try to exploit a planning loophole to win permission to build houses on open fields			1
in a damning indictment of the government 's relaxed planning laws , one successful land agent is now so confident it can bulldoze past local objections that it does not charge farmers an upfront fee for its services			1
a @entity17 investigation has revealed that @entity18 , a ' strategic land promoter ' , offers them the chance to increase the value of their land by a multiple of 50 or 60 by transforming agricultural land into development sites			1
the revelation comes days after two of the most respected rural institutions – the @entity44 and @entity45 – issued warnings that some of @entity49 's most picturesque countryside is being desecrated as a result of the government 's reforms			1
they said rural communities are alarmed at the ease with which businesses are able to win planning permission for housing in the face of local opposition			1
@entity45 said in an article last week that villages have been ' stripped of their natural defences ' by the government 's reforms , which have opened the floodgates to greenfield planning applications			1
its editor - at - large , @entity67 , wrote that while farmland was once protected , the balance had changed with the introduction of the new guidelines			2
councils must now show they have enough land to meet housing targets for the next five years – or lose key powers to ward off planning applications			1
sir @entity78 , the outgoing chairman of the @entity44 , said rolling farmland is being replaced by warehouses and bleak housing estates ' those who ca n't are naked in the face of predatory developers ' , mr @entity67 wrote			1
' communities that do n't have local plans in place are similarly meat for the wolves			0
' the government 's policies were also denounced by sir @entity78 , the outgoing chairman of the @entity44 , in an article for the @entity17			1
he wrote : ' @entity93 farmland is replaced by warehouses , bleak housing estates , wind turbines and advertising hoardings in fields			1
' the government is desperate to build more than 200,000 homes each year to meet booming demand			1
under its @entity105 , pushed into law two years ago , councils which have not earmarked suitable land to meet housing demand over the next five years must adopt a ' presumption ' in favour of planning permission			1
@entity18 , which has a turnover of £ 200million a year , targets councils that can not demonstrate a five - year housing supply			1
it offers to pay all the costs of obtaining planning permission – including the fees for lawyers and experts in the event of any appeal – which can exceed £ 300,000			1
if the attempt to win permission is unsuccessful , the farmer does not have to pay anything			2
the firm recently took out adverts in the farming press calling for sites of up to 50 acres on the edge of a towns or villages			2
its adverts boast : ' we aim to never lose and have won 90 per cent of our housing planning applications			1
' you pay nothing , win or lose			2
we only get our percentage after you have sold your land to the highest bidding housebuilder			2
' the firm has an astonishing success rate , having secured planning permission for rural sites in 41 out of its last 43 cases , despite substantial local opposition			0
its latest projects include a site for 112 homes in the idyllic @entity148 in @entity149 , immortalised in @entity151 's memoir cider with @entity152 ; an estate of 107 homes within view of the summit of the @entity29 's @entity157 ; and a 970 - house project in @entity160 which would expand the town of @entity162 by 12 per cent			2
among its other projects are plans for 1,500 homes near @entity167 , and 70 homes in @entity169 , @entity170 , in @entity172 's constituency			2
@entity30 , director of @entity18 , insisted his company focused on ' sensible , sustainable locations '			2
he said : ' we are professional at what we do , and proud to help deliver homes and associated prosperity to these towns and villages			2
' everyone needs reminding that we all live in a home which was built on what was once a green field			0
' planning minister @entity185 said : ' there remains strong protection of the countryside and @entity189			0
the best way for councils to send speculative vultures packing is to have an up to date local plan			0
' farmer @entity194 owns a share of the proposed development at @entity197 which has been targeted by planning firm @entity30 nestled in a valley on the edge of the @entity29 , an easy drive from @entity201 and @entity202 , @entity197 is an idyllic but bustling rural town			0
but its convenient location coupled with glorious views has drawn attention from planning consultants @entity18 , which has submitted plans for 107 houses			1
as agricultural land , the 15 - acre plot is worth less than £ 200,000			1
but with planning permission , the owners could sell it for about £ 13million – 65 times as much – with the developer taking a cut			0
and the developer could expect to sell the homes for about £ 235,000 each – a total of £ 25million			2
local people are furious about the proposal , which will be visible 11 miles away from the @entity222 ' highest point , @entity157			0
@entity223 , 47 , whose home of 23 years overlooks the fields , said : ' it is vandalism			0
it is completely eradicating the countryside , its history and its wildlife			0
' mr @entity223 is a founder member of @entity232 , a group of more than 400 residents campaigning against the plan			0
the family of farmers who own the fields were offered a ' no - win , no - fee ' deal by @entity30			1
farmer @entity194 , 61 , claims the land was ' no good ' for farming			0
he said : ' @entity30 approached us			0
they are always rooting about trying to find bits of land			0
we said if you can get the planning permission , then do it			0
it is a no - win , no - fee deal			1
they take a big cut if it goes through			0
they seem confident about getting it			0
' people keep saying we need houses , but then they would rather look out on a field			0
' his cousin @entity257 , known as @entity259 , farms 250 acres in the area , including the land earmarked for development			0
he said : ' there 's been quite a bit of objection			0

speculators are trying to exploit a loophole to build houses on open fields
@entity18 offers farmers chance to increase value of land
' predatory ' agent is pursuing 102 applications for housing developments
government wants to build 200,000 homes each year to meet demand
@entity45 said villages have been ' stripped of their natural defences '
an earlier *version* of this article carried a *headline* to the effect that *‘* no - win , no - fee lawyers *’* are *funding* farmers . we are happy to *clarify* that , as the article itself makes clear , it is @entity18 which is offering deals to farmers , rather than lawyers acting for them .
