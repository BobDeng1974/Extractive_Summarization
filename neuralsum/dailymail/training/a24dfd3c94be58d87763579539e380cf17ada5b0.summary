@entity0 laboured to a scrappy 1 - 0 win against @entity2 in @entity3 on sunday evening , @entity5 's free - kick finally breaking the deadlock against the 10 - man hosts			1
@entity9 's men enjoyed plenty of possession , but struggled to open up a dogged @entity2 outfit			1
here 's how @entity14 's @entity13 rated @entity0 's performances			1
his presence adds security in tricky away games but distribution let him down on occasions			0
@entity32 up the team in the tunnel before kick - off and got the clean sheet			2
@entity34 5.5 – steady in defence but @entity0 could have done with a more an attacking outlet at right back given their superiority			1
this will be an interesting position for @entity9 moving forward , @entity38 is better at getting forward but @entity41 is younger and steadier			0
@entity34 was again selected by @entity9 to start at right back for @entity0 , but offered little @entity42 6.5 – did n't put a foot wrong either defensively or starting up attacks			1
left his calling card on @entity47 with a strong tackle			0
he looks set to be the core of @entity0 's defence for many years to come			1
@entity51 5.5 – often had time on the ball without making the most of it			0
solid whenever a high ball was hoisted into the @entity0 box			2
now in his thirties , it is hard to see him improving and @entity61 will replace him when fit			0
@entity62 6 – still making the runs of old but lacks the dynamism of a couple of years ago			0
set up one good chance for @entity5 but missed a good free - kick opportunity			1
always offered himself as an attacking outlet but against better opposition you fear for him			0
@entity16 7 – lacks mobility as a holding midfielder when out of possession , but last night he was able to get forward and set up @entity5 's near - miss volley with the pass of the game			2
always on the lookout for the ball , won his fair share of free - kicks too			0
@entity0 's players leave the field at half time after failing to score against a side ranked 63 places below them @entity16 was @entity0 's best player on the night , and one pass for @entity5 in particular was spectacular the @entity90 midfielder lacks some of the necessary mobility to thrive in a defensive role , but was impressive @entity93 6.5 – caught early by the gloriously - named @entity94 , showed energy thereafter without the cutting edge			1
covers so much ground for @entity0 , hard to imagine the team without him			2
@entity101 pass nearly cost @entity0 early on but won the foul that got @entity2 skipper @entity103 sent off			1
shows great energy and mobility , perfect for the way @entity9 wants to set up , but not creative enough			0
@entity107 6 – found pockets of space between the @entity111 lines , making him a more natural no 10 than @entity113			0
but could n't pull off that one pass to make the difference			0
that playmaker 's job in the @entity0 team is up for grabs			2
@entity101 offered industry rather than creativity in the middle of the park before he was replaced @entity107 carries the ball forward but @entity0 lacked a creative spark in the centre of midfield @entity128 5.5 – not his day			2
the @entity111 were strong enough to counter his physical attributes and he did n't take up enough ' fox in the box ' positions			0
possibly his biggest contribution was getting shoved by @entity103 for the first of his two yellow cards			2
@entity5 6.5 – his effort and teamwork were exemplary , and he eventually compensated for two bad misses by scoring his 43rd @entity0 goal with a free - kick - before he could be taken off			1
should have added a second goal in injury - time but was foiled by the goalkeeper one - on - one			0
@entity0 captain @entity5 had his side 's two best chances in the first half , but could n't hit the target @entity5 blazes over when well placed as @entity0 struggled against their unfancied hosts in @entity3 @entity128 stretches for the ball but it was a match where @entity0 's spearhead was not at his sharpest substitutes : @entity153 ( for @entity154 ) 5.5 – did n't have a big impact after becoming @entity9 's first change @entity113 ( for @entity93 64 ) 6.5 – @entity9 's decision to hold him back worked with the winger winning the free - kick on the edge of the box for @entity5 to score @entity162 ( for @entity128 80 ) manager : @entity9 6.5 – can be justified in leaving @entity113 on the bench			1
the @entity166 winger may not have been happy but @entity9 gave him 26 minutes to make a difference , which he did			0
referee : @entity169 ( @entity170 ) 6.5 – got his biggest decision right , sending off @entity2 captain @entity103 for two clear yellow card offences on @entity128 and @entity173			1
@entity0 manager @entity9 looks on as his side failed to find their most fluent play against @entity2 @entity169 got his biggest decision right , showing @entity103 a second yellow for a clear foul			1

@entity5 free kick puts @entity0 ahead against @entity2
hosts had been reduced to 10 men after captain @entity103 sent off
@entity0 had struggled to break down hosts in @entity3
