by @entity0 published : 04:51 est , 25 may 2012 updated : 08:34 est , 25 may 2012 @entity1 will face the @entity2 on monday , three days before embattled culture secretary @entity3 takes the stand , it was announced today			2
calls have been growing for the former prime minister to answer allegations that @entity9 had ' unique access to @entity11 ' during @entity12 's 13 years in power			0
mp @entity14 told the the probe into press ethics this week that mr @entity17 even tried to halt his anti-phone hacking campaign by asking @entity1 to ' call him off '			0
close ? former @entity19 prime minister @entity1 , right , and @entity17 , @entity21 chairman and ceo , left , speak during a news conference held in conjunction with the @entity26 's 2008 annual awards dinner in @entity27 and last week @entity28 admitted that mr @entity1 and mr @entity17 had become ' closer than was wise '			2
he denied , however , there was a ' faustian pact '			0
@entity12 's former chief spin doctor @entity31 also sought to douse claims there was a cosy relationship between @entity21 and the party , telling the inquiry : ' i do n't think on policy anything was ever traded with @entity17 or with any other media owner			2
' unfazed : @entity3 put on a show of confidence this morning when he went for a jog near his @entity44 home the inquiry will seek to uncover the degree of contact between @entity9 and the @entity12 in the run up to the 1997 general election in which mr @entity1 took power for the first time after @entity49 famously switched its allegiance from the @entity54			2
in one of the most crucial - and potentially explosive - weeks of the inquiry so far , mr @entity3 will on thursday respond to damaging allegations surrounding his own links to @entity21 during its controversial takeover bid of @entity61 last year			1
he will also be challenged over whether his cheerleading for the £ 8 - billion bid was entirely impartial since he was bestowed quasi-judicial powers by prime minister @entity65			2
today , mr @entity65 defended his decision to hand responsibility to mr @entity3 , who is facing fresh calls from @entity12 to resign over his handling of the bid			1
' i do n't regret giving the job to @entity3 , it was the right thing to do in the circumstances , which were not of my making , ' mr @entity65 told @entity77 's @entity76			1
' the crucial point , the really crucial point , is did @entity3 carry out his role properly with respect to @entity61 and i believe that he did			2
' no date has been set for the prime minister 's appearance at the inquiry , but he said he was ' looking forward to giving evidence ' , as was mr @entity3 , so ' all of this will be out in the open '			1
it emerged yesterday that @entity3 privately urged @entity65 to back @entity17 ’s @entity61 takeover bid just weeks before the prime minister put him in charge of ruling on the issue , it emerged last night			1
in a bombshell email , the @entity3 lavished praise on the bid			0
mr @entity3 said it would allow mr @entity17 ’s son @entity96 to create ‘ the world ’s first multi-platform media operator ’ and insisted that if it was blocked the ‘ media sector will suffer for years ’			1
the @entity100 will now face tough questions over why he gave mr @entity102 responsibility for the bid , despite knowing that he had been privately cheerleading for the @entity105			0
critics will also question the wisdom of mr @entity65 joining mr @entity17 and @entity9 chief executive @entity108 for a cosy @entity110 lunch just a month later where the bid was discussed			2
i ca n't wait : @entity65 said he was ' looking forward to giving evidence ' so ' all of this will be out in the open ' while appearing on @entity115 's @entity76 controversial : @entity65 , right , today defended his decision to put @entity3 , left , in charge of dealing with @entity61 bid after @entity119 lost the role @entity121 led the charge against mr @entity3 today telling @entity123 the evidence of his wrongdoing was ' absolutely massive ' , arguing that instead of judging the @entity105 ’ bid , he was backing it			1
' there are two bits of evidence , actual straightforward evidence , that @entity3 was not impartial , he was meddling before he even took over the bid and was on the side of the @entity105 , ' she said			2
admission : @entity135 revealed that mr @entity17 's fixer ' bombarded ' him with information about the media giant 's bid to take over @entity61 ' the first was that he had to be warned off by the civil servants not to have any more meetings with @entity17 but he kept up the contact through his special adviser , and secondly he wrote a memo to the prime minister			1
' the @entity3 ’s message , revealed in evidence to the @entity150 inquiry into media standards yesterday , told mr @entity65 it would be ‘ totally wrong to cave in ’ to critics of the bid , including @entity123 director - general @entity153 , @entity154 and the @entity156 newspaper			1
mr @entity3 said @entity160 was ‘ pretty furious ’ that business secretary @entity119 had referred the bid to media regulator @entity162			1
he asked for a meeting with mr @entity65 , mr @entity119 and deputy prime minister @entity164 to discuss the handling of the deal			1
the disclosure appears directly to contradict mr @entity3 ’s insistence to mps last month that he had made ‘ absolutely no interventions seeking to influence a quasi-judicial decision that was at that time the responsibility of the secretary of state for business ’			1
it piles pressure on both mr @entity3 and mr @entity65 in the row over the government ’s handling of the @entity61 bid , which other media organisations argued would hand the @entity17 empire an unassailable dominance in @entity19			1
revelations : mr @entity3 said @entity160 , left was ‘ pretty furious ’ that business secretary @entity119 , right , had referred the bid to media regulator @entity162 @entity11 admitted that the then cabinet secretary @entity185 was not made aware of the private message when he was asked to determine weeks later whether mr @entity3 could act as an impartial judge of the deal , given his previous statements of admiration for mr @entity17			1
challenge : @entity121 led the charge against mr @entity3 today telling @entity123 the evidence of his wrongdoing was ' absolutely massive ' , arguing that instead of judging the @entity105 ' bid , he was backing it mr @entity65 handed mr @entity3 responsibility for determining the bid after mr cable , who had previously been in charge of the issue , was caught on tape boasting that he had ‘ declared war ’ on @entity21			1
the @entity3 ’s representations had already been the subject of legal warnings from his own department , according to the counsel to the @entity150 inquiry , @entity209			0
he said the @entity211 ’s legal director had advised that although it was not illegal for him to attempt to intervene , to do so would be ‘ unwise ’			0
a picture of the cosy relationship between the @entity17 empire and the department emerged at the inquiry yesterday , with evidence that @entity21 ’s chief lobbyist @entity219 exchanged more than 1,000 phone calls , emails and texts with the @entity3 ’s team during @entity21 ’s @entity61 takeover bid most were to and from mr @entity3 ’s special adviser @entity135 , who has already had to quit , admitting his contacts with @entity21 went beyond what had been authorised by the @entity3			1
also giving evidence in one of the most crucial weeks of the inquiry will be business secretary @entity119 , who was stripped of the role of deciding whether the bid could proceed last december after he was secretly recorded saying he had ' declared war ' on mr @entity17			1
after that , education secretary @entity234 and home secretary @entity235 will appear on tuesday and justice secretary @entity237 , after mr @entity119 , on wednesday			0
