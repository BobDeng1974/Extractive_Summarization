the @entity1 's deputy spokeswoman told a startled briefing room full of reporters thursday that she could n't define what ' completing the mission ' to defeat the self - declared @entity6 might look like			1
' " completing the mission " is a term – i do n't even know what that means when you 're talking about terrorist organizations , ' said @entity14			1
she also called ' completing the mission ' against the murderous terror army a ' catch - phrase ' and a ' buzzword			1
' the jaw - dropping statement came exactly one week after president @entity20 told the @entity22 press corps , referring to his own government , that ' we do n't have a strategy yet ' for dealing with @entity6 jihadis in @entity27			1
' @entity37 correspondent @entity36 asked @entity14 on thursday whether the administration believed the battle against @entity6 would extend past january 2017 , when president @entity20 will leave office after eight years			1
it 's a question he had asked @entity14 's boss , @entity42 , in tuesday 's briefing			2
but wednesday on @entity46 , deputy national security adviser @entity45 said that the ' sustained effort ' required to cripple @entity6 is ' going to take time , and it will probably go beyond even this administration to get to the point of defeat			2
' ' now , ' @entity36 said thursday , ' the administration has placed some kind of time - frame on this			0
so perhaps you could explain why this president , who has about 2 - and - a - half years left on his term – a little less than that – feels he can not complete this mission			1
' a visibly annoyed @entity14 snapped back			2
' let 's talk about what this mission means , because i think that 's a catch - phrase , ' she told @entity36			1
' obviously , we can not kill or capture every terrorist in the world , ' she said			0
' that 's not how – that 's not how this ends			0
we 've been clear about that			0
what we can do is take the fight to them			0
take their leaders off the battlefield			0
build partner networks on the ground			0
... so we can take away their capability to attack the @entity85 and significantly degrade that			0
' @entity14 seemed to mirror a schizophrenic policy articulated a day earlier in @entity88 by @entity20 himself , when he first said he aimed to ' destroy ' @entity6 but then vowed only to make it a more ' manageable ' threat			1
@entity14 clung to @entity20 's second statement while ignoring the first			2
@entity37 reporter @entity36 asked @entity14 whether the president thought he could finish off @entity6 before leaving office in january 2017 ' that 's how you fight terrorist organizations , ' she said			1
' completing the mission is a term – i do n't even know what that means when you 're talking about terrorist organizations			2
' it does n't always fall into a nice little buzzword , as you used in your question , ' she mocked @entity36			0
' " complete the mission – why wo n't he complete the mission by the end of this term ? " ' she cited the decline of @entity114 in @entity115 , the @entity117 's recent attack on @entity118 in @entity119 , and the drone - strike killing of the terror leader @entity121 as examples of intermediate victories that should reassure @entity85			1
' the record , @entity36 shot back , ' could also be seen as including @entity125 , the current chaos in @entity127 , [ and ] the rise of @entity6 to become the kind of threat that it is – but that would be argumentative			0
i do n't want to go there			0

@entity14 exploded at a @entity37 correspondent who questioned whether president @entity20 could knock out isis by the end of his term in office
also said ' completing the mission ' against the terror group is just a ' catch - phrase '
comes one week after @entity20 said ' we do n't have a strategy yet ' for defeating @entity6 in @entity27
