for one obese woman , trying to shed the pounds came with one major hurdle - she hated fruit and vegetables so much she had n't touched a piece of green veg since she was four and not a morsel of fruit had passed her lips since the age of 10			1
but at 21st 2lb 38 - year - old @entity11 from @entity12 , was so scared her weight was going to kill her she decided to bite the broccoli and face her fruit and vegetable phobia			1
after seven weeks of a calorie controlled diet , the mother - of - three , who appeared on @entity19 's weight loss documentary , weighing up @entity20 , last night managed to drop 11lb , 7.2 per cent of her body fat			1
' we currently receive housing benefit , council tax benefit and my husband receives a disability living allowance			1
it ’s not an option for us to me back to work			2
we would be worse off than we are now , ' she said			2
it was after losing her job that @entity11 piled on the pounds , putting on 6st in as many years			1
' i ate loads out of boredom more than anything			0
if i was feeling a bit low i just wanted my food , ' she admitted on the @entity19 programme presented by dr @entity51			1
she also admitted that there one friend who was always there for her - @entity54			1
‘ fried chicken was my favourite			0
it 's like a thousand little kisses			0
' as you put them into your mouth it ’s like they ’re kissing you and your tongue ’s saying thank you			0
' ' i ate loads out of boredom more than anything , ' said @entity11			0

‘ i knew if i did n’t change my lifestyle i was going to be dead soon – my body was going to give up			0
' i thought i was going to die - that my children would n’t get to see me			2
' i 'd done the @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 and i 'd even tried a @entity81 tea diet , ' she says , but none of them had worked			2
at 21st 2lb @entity11 was carrying an extra 11st and at 52 per cent , her body fat was double what it should have been			1
in order to shift the pounds welfare reliant @entity11 took on the challenge to stick to a calorie controlled diet , consuming a maximum of 1,200 calories a day			1
but without fruit and vegetables to eat , keeping down the calories was no simple feat. ' i did n’t eat fruit and i did n’t eat vegetables			2
perhaps if i did , i would n’t have been that size , ' she said			0
' last time i 'd had an apple i must have been about ten or 12			0
i did n’t have anything that was remotely healthy to be fair			0
' @entity104 was poison ! ' after seven weeks @entity11 lost 11lb , 7.2 per cent of her body fat and is continuing on her diet but spurred on by her husband @entity108 , @entity11 decided to give the green stuff a go			1
apart from the lack of healthy foods , she also had trouble cutting out the takeaway and snacks			0
' i tried not to cut everything out i enjoyed eating so that when i had a craving i could go upstairs into my drawer , which has given me loads of pleasure in the past , and have something i enjoyed eating as a treat			0
exercise also proved a challenge - even a short walk around the block was a huge challenge			2
' i have tried it in the past and it ’s been too painful to get round the whole thing			0
on her first attempt , @entity11 hoped to burn 500 calories , the equivalent of two @entity135 , but was disappointed to learn she had only worked off 95 calories			2
but spurred on by the idea that she may not see her children grow up , @entity11 stuck to a calorie controlled diet and upped her exercise - hitting the gym three times a week			1
