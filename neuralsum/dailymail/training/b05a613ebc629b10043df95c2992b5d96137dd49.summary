@entity7 ’s worst terror atrocity , in which 270 people died when @entity3 exploded above the @entity10 town in december 1988 , has always been blamed on @entity11			1
but a former @entity1 intelligence agent – now living under a witness protection scheme in @entity14 – has said publicly for the first time that the attack was ordered by @entity1 in revenge for the accidental downing of an @entity1 commercial jet by the @entity20 in 1988			1
it is also claimed that the bomb was placed on the doomed flight at @entity24 , rather than in @entity25 as had been thought			1
tragedy : the wreckage of @entity28 103 , the bombed airliner which exploded over the town of @entity3 , @entity10 , killing 243 passengers , 16 crew and a further 11 people on the ground it was carried out by @entity37 terrorists based in @entity5 , he says , and not on the orders of @entity11 dictator @entity40			1
the atrocity killed 243 passengers , 16 crew and a further 11 people on the ground in @entity3			2
ex-spy @entity44 claims in a documentary aired tonight on @entity47 that former @entity1 leader @entity48 wanted to mirror the 1988 @entity50 strike on an @entity1 @entity51 and recruited a @entity5 - based group to plan an attack			1
@entity44 , who defected to @entity14 in the 1990s , said that the supreme leader , who died in 1989 , wanted revenge			1
he told documentary makers from @entity47 : ‘ @entity1 decided to retaliate as soon as possible			2
the decision was made by the whole system in @entity1 and confirmed by @entity48			1
the target … was to copy exactly what happened to the @entity1 @entity51			0
everything exactly the same , minimum 290 people dead			1
’ @entity11 intelligence officer @entity63 , left , was convicted of the bombing , but an @entity1 defector claims @entity48 , right , ordered the attack in revenge for a @entity50 strike on an @entity1 @entity51 evidence unearthed by the documentary - makers includes the names of four suspects belonging to the @entity5 - based radical group , the @entity73 – general command			1
the individuals were allegedly responsible for devising the plot , making the bomb and planting it			0
the programme suggests that the plot was hatched at a secret meeting in @entity25 , attended by representatives from the @entity11 , @entity5 and @entity1 regimes			1
@entity83 , left , head of the @entity84 is named as the plot ’s mastermind			0
he recruited @entity88 bomb - maker @entity89 , centre , but the delivery was made by @entity92 , right , who put it on @entity3 at @entity24 @entity83 , the @entity5 head of the @entity84 is named as the plot ’s mastermind			1
he recruited @entity96 , a @entity37 , and @entity88 bomb - maker @entity89			1
these two were arrested by @entity14 police , who discovered four bombs , months before @entity3			0
however , it is claimed that a fifth bomb was made and used for the @entity3 attack			2
another man , @entity92 is named as the bomb ’s alleged courier			0
@entity44 ’s claims raise new questions about the guilt of @entity63 , an intelligence officer serving @entity40 , who was convicted of mass murder in 2001			0
it has been asserted that @entity40 devised the attack in retaliation for the @entity50 bombing of @entity11 in 1986			0

mourners at the funeral service in @entity121 for those who died when the @entity123 passenger jet was shot down over the @entity124 on july 3 , 1988 an @entity1 passenger jet was shot down by an @entity50 naval warship patrolling the @entity124 , killing all on board			1
@entity128 had been travelling from @entity129 in @entity1 to @entity130 when it was shot down by the @entity131 , resulting in the deaths of 290 civilians from six countries , including 66 children			2
the @entity131 had tracked the plane electronically and warned it to keep away			0
when it did not the ship fired two surface - to - air missiles at the @entity140 @entity139 , carrying many @entity1 on their way to @entity142			2
the attack still has the highest death toll of any aviation incident involving an @entity140 , and any such incident in the @entity147			0
an official inquiry carried out by the @entity50 attributed the mistake to human error , saying that the crew had incorrectly identified the plane as a @entity154 fighter , and that the flight did not identify itself otherwise			0
however , the @entity1 government has always disputed the @entity50 version of events , with many claiming that the attack was purposeful , and a sign that the @entity50 can not be trusted in its dealings with the country			2
the black box flight recorder on board the @entity51 was never found , so it is unknown whether the crew ignored the @entity50 warnings via distress frequencies , or did not hear them			0
@entity123 continues to use flight number @entity128 on the route as a memorial to the victims ( file photo ) it was only in 1992 that the @entity50 officially admitted that the vessel had been in @entity1 waters after one of its helicopters drew warning fire from @entity1 speedboats for operating within @entity1 territory			2
in 1996 the @entity50 agreed to pay @entity1 $ 61.8 million in compensation for the 248 @entity1 killed , plus the cost of the aircraft and legal expenses			2
it had already paid a further $ 40 million to the other countries whose nationals were killed			0
to date a formal apology has not been issued by the @entity50 for the tragedy			0
some believe the @entity3 bombing , carried out six months later in december 1988 , was masterminded by @entity1 in revenge for the @entity51 tragedy , although a @entity11 man was convicted and jailed in 2001			1
going against an informal convention to discontinue flight numbers associated with aviation tragedies , @entity123 continues to use flight number @entity128 on the route as a memorial to the victims .			0
