its inventors claim it is as agile and affordable as a scooter while as safe and comfortable as a car the @entity7 has a front ' pod ' that can be changed for different tasks			1
here , the passenger version is shown , but cargo and even kitchen versions are also being developed the 2 - wheel @entity7 electric scooter is designed as a transporter for densely populated megacities where congested traffic is a major problem			1
