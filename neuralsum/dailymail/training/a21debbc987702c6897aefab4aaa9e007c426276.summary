by @entity0 under fire : @entity3 mp @entity2 has has been attacked by the @entity4 and her own party after she complained that her husband @entity6 died ' like a battery hen ' in hospital yesterday , the hospital where @entity2 ’s husband died issued an official report dismissing her claims against it			1
the @entity3 mp is the latest in a long list of patients and their families who the @entity4 feels it can ignore with impunity			1
this is despite the fact that this courageous widow , grieving for her beloved husband , stood up in @entity25 determined to expose the ‘ indifferent ’ and ‘ callous ’ staff and the lack of care that she claimed caused his death			1
it is despite the fact that @entity32 was so impressed by her first - hand experiences that he asked her to overhaul the complaints system of the @entity4			1
it is despite the fact that her harrowing testimony brought forth a flood of letters from the public telling similar stories of neglect			2
that cuts no ice with @entity48 , @entity49			2
@entity50 might have died like ‘ a battery hen ’ , shoved up against the bars of his tiny bed , his feet hanging over the edge , bereft of even socks or a blanket to keep him warm , according to his wife			1
but the investigation by hospital staff , overseen by an independent panel of experts , dismissed 21 of the mp ’s 31 complaints as unproven or by saying ‘ insufficient evidence to uphold this concern ’			1
anyone who has made a complaint to the @entity4 , whether questioning an indifferent nurse or making a more formal accusation , knows the response they will get only too well — a barrage of doublespeak designed to confuse and weary you			1
only once in the report into @entity50 ’ death does the doublespeak falter			2
that is when it knocks up against the fact he waited 27 hours in @entity83 and then died of hospital - acquired pneumonia			1
‘ this concern is upheld except that it is not upheld that there was a lack of care and attention , ’ is the hospital ’s response			1
go wonder at that one			0
@entity92 , the writer who invented the phrase doublespeak in his novel 1984 , could not have put it better			0
taking on the @entity4 is not for the faint - hearted , as ms @entity96 is discovering			1
our health service seems to have reached new levels of paranoia			0
happier times : @entity2 with her husband @entity50 on their wedding day 1963			2
he died aged 73 at @entity48 of @entity105 when i was investigating the @entity4 for the @entity108 ten years ago , managers did not know what was going on in their hospitals because they rarely visited a ward or asked patients about their experiences			1
they could at least claim ignorance and hope the whole thing would go away			0
now , instead of not responding to complaints , the @entity4 turns aggressively on the person daring to complain			1
our caring service has become more like something out of an airport thriller — a vast , malign organisation bullying patients and their loved ones , threatening whistleblowers and spending huge sums of taxpayers ’ money to grind them down			0
just this week it emerged that @entity130 spent £ 6 million on legal fees , employed a pr firm and even set private detectives to dig dirt on dr @entity135 , a heart surgeon who had spoken out about the dangerous conditions on his wards			0
that is all he had done			0
complaint : mrs @entity2 , 77 , claimed her husband had been victim of an ' almost callous lack of care ' and was treated with ' contempt ' by @entity4 staff before his death in october 2012 for that , as his lawyer said , he was ‘ vilified , bullied and harassed out of a job he loved ’			1
@entity2 does not work for the @entity4 , but the organisation has done its best to hit her where it hurts			1
she has accused hospital bosses of an ‘ outrageous breach of confidentiality ’ by publishing detailed information about her husband ’s death			1
as she said : ‘ no one is going to make a complaint in future if their personal details are going to be made public in this way			0
’ the @entity4 being essentially a political organisation			1
ms @entity2 also finds herself under fire from her own party			0
recently @entity105 ’s first minister @entity169 launched a stinging attack on her for critical comments made about the @entity4 — saying she had ‘ no evidence and no facts ’ to back up allegations of a crisis in the service			1
the @entity3 welsh assembly member @entity177 was outraged at ms @entity2 ’s concerns about the high mortality rates in some @entity4 hospitals			1
she accused ms @entity181 of ‘ denigrating ’ the @entity4 and warned that ‘ she should stop ’			1
actually , no , she should n’t			0
what should stop are the high mortality rates			0
but that is unlikely to happen any time soon , given the fact that @entity3 ’s @entity186 have voted against inviting her to give evidence to an influential @entity189 committee			2
where the @entity192 @entity191 asked her to lead an inquiry , the @entity3 government has blocked and denigrated her			2
her facts were good enough to alarm sir @entity196 , chief medical officer for @entity197 , but not @entity198			0
@entity96 has discovered that patients come a very poor second to propagating the @entity4 myth			1
how crucial that myth is we saw in spades at the @entity205 opening ceremony			0
its artistic director , @entity206 , would have us believe that the health service is stuffed with lovely , dancing nurses in starched caps who read stories to sick children			0
many of our elderly patients would be pathetically grateful for a nurse that paused long enough at their bedside to offer them a drink — never mind bedtime stories			0
the response of assembly members and hospital boards is typical			2
i came across it when investigating the @entity4 over nine months			1
my accounts of what i had seen were also dismissed as ‘ anecdotal ’			2
while there are undoubtedly countless dedicated and caring people working for the @entity4 who put themselves out for patients , like @entity2 , i , too , was flooded with letters from patients who ’d suffered the same ‘ anecdotal ’ experiences of callousness and incompetence			1
vision : the @entity205 opening ceremony 's artistic director , @entity206 , would have us believe that the health service is stuffed with lovely , dancing nurses in starched caps an old man described on the phone how he had watched his wife die of neglect			2
his call reduced me to tears			0
‘ i do n’t know who to complain to			0
no one will listen , ’ he said by way of apology at the end of the conversation			0
in a court of law , the testimony of a witness is given due weight			0
in the @entity4 , the same testimony is traduced as anecdote			1
that is part of the problem			0
every patient with a complaint is made to feel isolated — a one - off , who really should n’t presume to denigrate such a noble institution			2
look at what happened to a @entity3 mp of long standing			2
what chance do the rest of us have ? one of the only reasons that the scandal of @entity279 came out was because a number of relatives of patients happened to go to the same nearby cafe and started to exchange stories			0
tragedy : @entity50 waited 27 hours in @entity83 and then died of hospital - acquired pneumonia they quickly realised that what they had been told was a one - off was , in fact , a systematic failure of the trust and the whole @entity294 project for the @entity4			1
this was one reason why their evidence had to be rubbished — with the woman who led the protests falling victim to a vicious hate campaign			0
the tragedy is that similar evidence against the @entity4 is still being rubbished			1
let us end with one of those anecdotes the authorities dismiss — one left by a woman to comment on a story about @entity96 on the @entity313 website			0
the woman describes the degrading treatment of her dying mother in one @entity4 hospital			1
when she complains , she says , ‘ ranks are closed so people do n’t take things further ’			0
the authorities know complaints fall on ‘ deaf ears and some like myself , because of their own ill health , do not have the stamina to follow things through			2
money will be another obstacle to fight these cases , as they will inevitably carry on for years before a conclusion			0
’ it has happened to two friends			0
‘ three years down the line and they still do not have closure			0
’ she finishes with this heartfelt plea : ‘ let me explain how i feel about @entity2 ’s findings			2
myself and many , many friends who have experienced the disgusting downfalls of the @entity4 @entity4 have all said we ’d rather commit suicide than go into hospital when we are too old to stay at home through ill health			1
i will not be treated as a discarded piece of nuisance rubbish , as my mother was			0
’ rather than another expensive , time - wasting re-organisation of the @entity4 , let the government take one simple step			1
create a website , not particular to individual hospitals , but a general forum where people can post these heart - breaking stories			2
how many hospitals will have the gall to dismiss case after case with their blanket approach of ‘ insufficient evidence ’ ? that way , patients will know they are not alone			0
and a malign bureaucracy will no longer get away with dismissing stories of cruelty and death as ‘ merely anecdotal ’ .			2
