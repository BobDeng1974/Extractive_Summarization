@entity1 , 54 , is accused of murdering former business partners @entity2 and @entity14 and their daughters @entity6 , 18 , and @entity7 , 12 , in ‘ simple revenge ’ over losing a seven - year legal dispute			1
mr @entity4 , a 46 - year - old lecturer in polymer science at @entity18 and his wife , a translator , 47 , were stabbed to death with ‘ ruthless efficiency ’ in the kitchen of their executive home			2
a court heard how police followed a trail of bloody footprints upstairs to a bedroom where their daughters had been attacked in similar fashion			0
in the 20 - second emergency call , made from @entity7 ’s mobile phone , two females were recorded delivering repeated , blood - curdling screams , as the operator attempted to ask if fire , ambulance or police were needed			1
the call handler is then heard trying to pass the call on to police before the line abruptly falls silent			2
throughout the recording , one woman juror kept her face covered by her hands , as @entity1 stared at the floor			1
relatives of the @entity51 , who have travelled from @entity52 for the trial , stared ashen faced from the public gallery			0
after the clip was played , mr @entity55 asked the jury panel of eight women and four men whether they were able to continue , as one of their number dabbed at tears with her handkerchief			1
prosecutor @entity65 had earlier warned the panel would have to ‘ steel themselves ’ to listen to the clip			0
the jury has been told that the catalyst for the horror was an injunction which had been served on @entity1 the night before the killing spree , which prevented him from disposing of his assets			1
mr @entity76 said @entity1 realised he ‘ faced ruin ’ , and planned the attack that night , travelling to the home ‘ like a man on a mission ’ and armed with a kitchen knife			1
@entity1 is accused of murdering the @entity4 family in ' simple revenge ' over losing a seven - year legal dispute the court heard mr @entity4 and his wife were stabbed to death in the kitchen of their home			1
it was told police followed a trail of bloody footprints upstairs to a bedroom where their daughters had been attacked in similar fashion yesterday the court heard from the neighbour who raised the alarm , after initially becoming concerned that the @entity51 had , ‘ unusually ’ , left a garage door open			0
@entity103 told the court he walked around to the rear of the @entity4 family ’s £ 350,000 home in @entity108 , @entity109 , and , when he peered through a rear window , saw ‘ what i thought was brown paint on the floor ’			2
when he looked more closely , mr @entity103 ‘ saw a pair of legs ( on the floor )			0
’ he added : ‘ it was then that i realised it was actually blood on the floor			0
’ shaking and trembling , the neighbour asked his wife to call police			2
mr @entity4 ( left ) was a lecturer at @entity18 while his wife @entity2 ( right ) was a translator officers forced entry and discovered mrs @entity14 behind the kitchen door , in her dressing gown , while her trouser - clad husband lay under a radiator			0
there was ‘ blood spatter up the walls and around the kitchen ’ , while the blood on the floor was ‘ black and dried ’ , the court heard			0
@entity7 was discovered ‘ curled up ’ on a bed , while her sister lay on the floor , partially ‘ tucked ’ behind the headboard in a ‘ prayer position ’			0
the ‘ massacre ’ unfolded on the day of the royal wedding between prince @entity65 and @entity145 in april 2011 , the jury heard			2
afterwards , @entity1 , who like @entity4 and mrs @entity14 moved to the @entity147 from @entity52 , fled in the family ’s car			1
he was eventually tracked down to @entity150 more than a year later , and was extradited back to the @entity147 earlier this year			0
sisters @entity153 ( left ) and @entity7 ( right ) were also killed in the attack , the court heard the jury at @entity156 have been told there is no dispute that @entity1 carried out the attack			1
but mr @entity76 told them he is expected to claim that he should be found guilty of manslaughter rather than murder , on the basis of either diminished responsibility or loss of control			0
but mr @entity76 said : ‘ the prosecution does not accept that this is anything other than the clearest case of murder , with the obvious motive of revenge , and any claim otherwise by @entity1 is simply a blatant and transparent attempt to avoid his full responsibility for these grotesque killings			1
’ @entity1 , from @entity178 , denies four counts of murder			2
sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
