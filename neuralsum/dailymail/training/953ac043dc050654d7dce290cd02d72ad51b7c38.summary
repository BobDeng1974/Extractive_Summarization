she asked if it was any different than having a glass of wine she learned that @entity41 , where she stayed with her family , is pot - free because the mountain is federal land , so she traveled to nearby @entity45 to find some marijuana			1
there , she bought a $ 25 chocolate chip cranberry ' lucie in the @entity50 ' cookie and some @entity52 - infused chocolate truffles , she wrote			2
when the children were asleep , they ate part of the cookie			2

' how do you even broach the subject of marijuana ? mommy needs her glass of wine is now mommy needs her hit of weed ? ' she wrote			1
' at their age , it 's probably best to keep it black and white			0
drugs , drinking and sex are all bad -- very bad ! ' but she added that they were sure to put their adult treats in their bedroom , so their children would not run the risk of eating them accidentally			0
