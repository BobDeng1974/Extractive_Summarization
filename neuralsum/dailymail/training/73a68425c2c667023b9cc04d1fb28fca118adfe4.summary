by @entity0 published : 12:11 est , 20 august 2013 updated : 12:12 est , 20 august 2013 former president @entity2 's foundations spent a total of $ 50million on travel over the past decade , $ 12.1million of which was spent in just one year			1
an internal investigation into spending at the various charities that the former president runs found that the funds used for travel costs have gone up in recent years			1
the audit comes as new reports have revealed that the @entity14 has been ' in the red ' for years even though the charity has raised hundreds of millions of dollars each year , showing the high cost of running the worldwide charity			0
@entity19 : @entity2 , seen here with his daughter @entity22 during a trip to @entity24 , @entity25 in august , has dedicated much of his post-presidential time to working on his global health causes through his charity former president @entity2 called in a team of lawyers to help examine the charity 's financial standing over a year ago and they drew some unsettling conclusions , and the @entity34 reports that the internal audit documents point out their travel expenses as one costly factor			1
since @entity2 left office in 2000 , he helped create a network of charities that have a worldwide and ever - changing list of causes , from helping @entity44 after the earthquake to water cleaning practices in @entity25			2
the amount spent by each arm of the charities was broken down by @entity50 for 2011 , which was the latest fiscal year where such data was available			0
the @entity53 was the biggest spender , paying $ 7.2million on travel in 2011 , and the @entity14 followed with $ 4.2million while the @entity56 spent $ 730,000			1
big spending : since 2003 , @entity2 's various charities have spent more than $ 50m in travel costs ; the causes take him all over the globe , like to this school in @entity44 where the @entity14 launched a cholera awareness campaign in2011 will travel : all of the foundations spent $ 12.1m in 2011 , and ten percent of that was allotted to the former president 's costs alone ( seen here at a charity golf event that his foundation sponsored with the @entity70 this january ) of that $ 12.13million spent in 2011 , 10 per cent was specified as being the cost of travel for the former president himself			1
though the total travel fees from 2010 are still unknown , the former president 's costs took up more of the allotment as they represent 13 per cent of the fees			0
moving forward , the travel expenses for the former first family will only be growing as @entity22 joined the board of her father 's charities in 2011			1
soon the overarching group is due to be renamed the @entity2 , @entity87 and @entity86			0
their expenses are not the only ones who are getting some attention , as an earlier @entity93 article told how the charity also paid for @entity96 winner @entity95 to fly first class to an event in @entity99 , @entity100 , along with her pet dog			0
after concerns were raised about how the charity 's money was being spent , in 2012 @entity2 called in a team of lawyers to look over the finances and organization of the various branches of the charities to see if there was excess or inefficiencies			2
new addition : @entity114 joined the board of her father 's charities in 2011 so she is becoming a more frequent attendee on international visits - like this one to @entity118 in may of this year adding expertise : @entity22 used her consulting background to help root out inefficiencies in spending ( seen with her father on the foundation - related trip to @entity25 earlier this year ) their findings showed that even though they raised $ 214million last year , they still had an $ 8million deficit because of earlier fundraising issues during the 2007 - 2008 recession			2
calling the meeting was n’t the only way that the former president has had a hand in helping the group save money : it was revealed that he often also uses his billionaire friend ’s private jets for certain long distance flights			0
by using grocery - store magnate @entity140 ’ plane for trips - like his recent one with @entity22 to @entity25 last month - the charities either pay a discounted rate to @entity145 or he writes the expense off as a charitable donation			0
such close ties to the @entity150 billionaire also shows another reason why the @entity152 have been actively staying away from the ongoing @entity154 mayoral race , as @entity140 is running as a @entity150 against a number of @entity87 ’s former colleagues from her days in the @entity157 - not to mention her longtime aide @entity159 ’s husband , @entity158			0
in addition to being concerned about making the most of their fundraising money , there is also the very serious possibility that @entity87 runs for president in 2016 and if she does , her involvement in the charity will be carefully scrutinized			2
setting her sights : since stepping down from the @entity170 , @entity87 has become more active in her husband 's charities but she may be leaving again to run for president in 2016			1

former president @entity2 runs a number of charities under his name that are *focused* on *eradicating* world health *problems*
an internal audit showed that the charities spent more than $ 50m on travel expenses since 2003 , *including* $ 12.1m in 2011 alone
rooting out inefficiencies in time for @entity87 to decide whether she is going to run for office in 2016
