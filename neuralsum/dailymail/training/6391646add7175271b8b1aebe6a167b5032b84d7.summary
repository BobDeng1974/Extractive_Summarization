by @entity0 published : 11:32 est , 5 april 2013 updated : 11:32 est , 5 april 2013 residents in a small village of just 30 homes have accused the @entity4 of ruining their tranquillity after allowing a country manor house to open on sundays			1
locals in @entity9 , near @entity10 , @entity11 , say keeping @entity12 open all weekend will overwhelm the village			2
they fear the village will be swamped with traffic and have accused the @entity4 of a lack of consultation			1
uproar : villagers are concerned the extended opening hours of @entity20 , @entity11 , will lead to an influx of visitors but the charity says that extending the opening hours will see visitors to the @entity27 manor jump from 26,809 last year to an estimated 30,500			1
at a parish council meeting with the trust , some of the village 's 75 residents aired their views			2
councillor @entity34 said the plan would change the character of the unspoiled @entity38 village			0
he said : ' how can the village trust the @entity4 ? ' villagers are angry at the lack of consultation , lack of response to numerous emails regarding the issue , and complete lack of any form of impact assessment			1
' the village 's infrastructure can not cope , and the once green verges of the road into the village have been destroyed			0
' @entity12 was built between 1607 and 1612 by a prosperous wool merchant as a statement of his wealth and power			0
@entity12 has acquired the property in 1991 after the family finances took a turn for the worst			0
@entity63 , the charity 's @entity64 general manager , said : ' across the @entity4 it 's now the norm rather than the exception to open on sundays			1
