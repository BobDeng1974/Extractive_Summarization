@entity0 might struggle to convince the majority of coaches in modern elite sport that banning chips the night before a game amounted to a catastrophic error of judgment			1
but in his new autobiography the former @entity9 defender presents an aversion to deep fried potatoes as one of a number of reasons why @entity16 failed to last beyond 10 months as the successor to sir @entity18			1
some might point to @entity0 as one of a number of senior players who happened to be past their best when @entity16 took charge at @entity25 in july last year			1
there is no denying @entity16 was presented with a huge rebuilding job that is only now being addressed by @entity28 with a massive transfer outlay approaching £ 200million			2
you can like our @entity9 facebook page here @entity0 ( right ) says that playing under @entity16 ( left ) at @entity9 was embarrassing @entity0 ( right ) returned to @entity25 to face @entity9 with @entity34 @entity0 and @entity9 struggled for form under @entity16 ' management last season @entity38 would not deny he made mistakes either			1
indeed he admitted as much in the interview he gave to @entity41 ; the first since his brutal dismissal on april 22			0
but @entity0 gives his own , fairly detailed view of the @entity16 tenure in the book , # @entity43 , being serialised in the @entity47 the 35 - year - old defender , who moved to @entity34 during the summer , does recognise that @entity16 was ‘ unlucky ’			1
he also says he could not fault his desire to succeed			0
‘ he was a genuine guy and no one could have worked harder , ’ he writes			0
but @entity0 thought @entity16 made a number of key mistakes , among them the banning of what had long been part of a traditional pre-match meal			1
he said it was ‘ a ritual ’ to have ‘ low - fat chips the night before a game ’			1
@entity0 said the @entity9 players ‘ loved ’ their chips but within a week of becoming manager @entity16 had banned them ‘ for no good reason ’			1
‘ all the lads were p * * * * d off , ’ complains @entity0			2
he says the moment @entity16 left and @entity71 took temporary charge , chips returned to the menu			2
@entity16 believed in going for a pre-match team walk			2
@entity0 said this was anathema to the players			2
‘ when lots of little things start changing its destabilising , ’ he said			0
@entity9 struggled under @entity38 and failed to qualify for the @entity81 , finishing seventh @entity0 ( left ) has slammed @entity16 for the @entity84 's reign as manager of @entity9 in his interview with @entity41 , @entity16 accepted that in hindsight he might have taken ‘ a slightly different approach ’			1
at the same time he conceded methods that proved successful at @entity90 perhaps did not work as well at @entity9			2
but he insisted he did not go in and make wholesale changes			0
‘ i did n’t want to change anything immediately , ’ he said last month			0
‘ i wanted to take my time working out what i thought was needed			0
’ he felt he was ‘ not given time to succeed or fail ’ , but praised the players for their work ethic			0
‘ they were fantastic , ’ he said			0
@entity0 is not quite so generous towards @entity16 , claiming there was a lack of clarity when it came to tactics and a lack of appreciation of what it meant to be part of @entity9			1
he recalls a training session @entity16 held in a public part of @entity109 ahead of a @entity81 game at @entity111			2
@entity0 said it was ‘ bizarre ’ to practise set - pieces in front of members of the public who began filming the session			2
‘ it was amateurish , ’ writes @entity0			0
‘ i mean , why not just send @entity111 an email or a dvd			0
’ @entity0 reveals how @entity16 then told him he would not be playing against the @entity121 ‘ in front of everybody ’			1
‘ it was probably the worst single moment i had at @entity9 , ’ he recalls			0
inside i wanted to scream and grab him			0
’ @entity0 received a warm welcome from the @entity25 faithful when he returned with @entity34 @entity16 ( left ) was sacked as @entity9 manager in april but had managed @entity0 when it came to delivering instructions for the match , @entity0 claims @entity16 only succeeded in confusing the players			1
he says @entity18 used to give ‘ simple , concise , clear instructions ’			0
@entity16 , however , said they could employ ‘ three formations ’ depending on ‘ how @entity111 played ’			0
‘ we lost and 13 days later @entity16 was sacked , ’ writes @entity0			1
the former @entity138 captain agrees that @entity16 was not dismissed ‘ in a dignified way ’ by @entity9			1
but he says @entity16 ‘ tried to impose a vision but never seemed to be completely clear what that vision should be ’			0
he says he ‘ unintentionally created a negative vibe ’ and ‘ slowly lost ’ the players because of an ‘ accumulation of mistakes ’			1
@entity0 thinks @entity16 abandoned @entity9 ’s tradition for playing with ‘ wingers ’ , and instead ‘ wanted the wide players coming inside ’			1
he also stopped the ‘ small - sided match on a small pitch ’ the players used to enjoy under @entity18 on the eve of a game , changing it to a two - touch game			0
@entity0 says this was why @entity9 so often ‘ looked cramped and played without imagination ’ .			2
