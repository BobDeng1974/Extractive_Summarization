the marriage license of mass murderer @entity2 and a 26 - year - old devotee who believes in his innocence is set to expire without a wedding taking place , prison officials said monday			1
@entity8 spokesman @entity7 said weekend visiting for inmates passed without @entity2 getting married			2
@entity11 @entity10 and the 80 - year - old @entity2 obtained a 90 - day marriage license late last year			1
it expires thursday , making this past weekend the couple 's final opportunity to hold a wedding inside a visiting room at @entity18 , @entity19			1
if the wedding is to happen , the couple must register for a new @entity22 marriage license			2
no wedding yet : @entity24 , 26 , says she has been a fan on @entity2 , 80 , since she was a teenager			1
they had planned to marry , but after 90 days with no wedding , their @entity22 , @entity29 license to marry will expire @entity30 , who goes by the name ' star ' and says she loves @entity2 , left her home halfway across the country and has spent the last nine years living near the @entity29 prison			1
@entity2 was convicted of killing seven people , including pregnant actress @entity37 , the wife of director @entity38			2
@entity30 , who maintains websites espousing @entity2 's innocence , has not responded to recent requests seeking comment on the relationship			2
too late : the infamous cult leader had his final opportunity to marry @entity30 during visitation hours over the weekend before the license expires thursday shortly after obtaining the license , she told @entity50 the nuptials were imminent : ' y'all can know that it 's true , ' she said in november			1
' it 's going to happen			0
' not long after that , @entity24 was spotted fabric shopping and looking at white satin , possibly for a wedding dress to sew for the jailhouse ceremony			1
@entity24 has been writing to @entity2 since she was a teen and even moved from her home in @entity61 to the @entity29 town where he is imprisoned			1
previous reports had said the two were already married , but a formal ceremony had yet to be held			0
the couple filed for a marriage license on november 7 , which gave them just 90 days to carry out the nuptials			0
@entity29 @entity72 spokesman @entity7 previously stated that the wedding would have to take place on a visiting day , which happen on saturdays , sundays and certain holidays ( including @entity77 )			2
@entity7 said the couple would be allowed 10 guests from outside the prison , two guests from inside the prison and an officiant of their own choosing			0
however , the two are not be allowed to consummate their marriage since @entity2 's life in prison sentence bans him from receiving conjugal visits			0
in previous interviews , @entity24 gushed about falling in love with @entity2 and his ' philosophy ' as a teen , and how she already considered herself married to him			2
@entity95 , a @entity96 photo agency editor , said that he maintains contact with @entity30 and that she intends to obtain another 90 - day license and go ahead with the marriage			1
looked at fabrics : @entity2 was granted a marriage license to marry @entity24 in november of last year , which would expire in 90 days			1
soon after getting the license , @entity24 was spotted out looking at fabrics , potentially to sew a dress with for the ceremony postponed ? @entity24 's wedding would have had to take place during visitation hours this past weekend but they missed the mark what 's more , @entity2 's son @entity111 has just recently revealed that one of the reasons his father is set to wed @entity30 is so that the two can have a child			1
and while the two are not allowed conjugal visits , @entity111 says of his father ; ' somehow he hopes to smuggle his sperm out of the prison			0
' he then added ; ' he wants to see what it might be like to raise a child with more of his own ideas			0
he is starting to think about how he wants his legacy to be left once he â€™s gone			0
' @entity111 also said in his interview with @entity128 that his father has wanted this for many years			0
' part of the whole thing with him marrying @entity24 is that he would love to have kids and he was waiting for someone to come along and provide that , ' he explained			0
@entity2 became notorious in 1969 as the leader of a ' family ' of young killers			2
@entity2 follower @entity138 died of cancer behind bars , but @entity141 and @entity142 remain imprisoned			0
so do @entity143 , @entity144 and @entity145 , who is expected to have a parole hearing feb. 19			0
@entity2 is eligible for parole next in 2027			0
@entity111 ( above ) the son of @entity2 , says his father wants to have another child and @entity24 would be the mother -- though , they are not allowed conjugal visits so they 'd have to somehow smuggle his sperm			1

@entity2 , 80 , and @entity11 @entity10 were issued a 90 - day license in @entity22 , @entity29 but their last available visitation day has come and gone
the license expires thursday despite @entity30 -- who goes by @entity24 -- having been *photographed* recently shopping for white satin fabric
an insider claims @entity30 still intends to marry the infamous cult leader , but she *'ll* need to get a new license in order to do so
