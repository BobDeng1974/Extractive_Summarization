at the current rate of deforestation , the world 's rainforests could completely disappear in 100 years			0
most scientists suggests fewer forests means larger amounts of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and an increase in global warming			1
but a new study argues that relationship is n't as straightforward and that deforestation could in fact be cooling the planet			2
at the current rate of deforestation , rainforests could completely disappear in a hundred years			0
a new study argues that deforestation could in fact be cooling the planet rather than contributing to global warming researchers at @entity21 claim the process is being driven by the transformation of forests into cropland causing a net cooling effect on global temperatures			1
deforestation over the last 150 years has reduced global emissions of biogenic volatile organic compounds ( @entity31 )			1
bvocs increase the atmospheric distribution of short - lived climate pollutants , such as methane , which have a warming influence on climate			1
' land cover changes caused by humans since the industrial and agricultural revolutions have removed natural forests and grasslands and replaced them with croplands , ' said @entity45 , one of the researchers			0
researchers at @entity21 claim the process is being driven by the transformation of forests into cropland causing a net cooling effect on global temperatures ' and croplands are not strong emitters of these @entity31 - often they do n't emit any @entity54			1
' the researchers used computer modelling to calculate @entity31 declines and found that there has been a 30 per cent decline between 1850 and 2000 , largely through the conversion of forests to cropland			1
greenhouse gas levels in the atmosphere reached a record high in 2013 driven by a surge in the level of carbon dioxide , a study claims			1
experts say carbon dioxide ( @entity72 ) concentrations grew at the fastest rate since reliable global records began and have called for international action to combat climate change			2
the rise in @entity72 levels is outpacing fossil fuel use , suggesting that the planet 's natural ability to soak up emissions of the gas may be slowing down			0
‘ we know without any doubt that our climate is changing and our weather is becoming more extreme due to human activities such as the burning of fossil fuels , ’ said @entity84 , the secretary general of the @entity85 ( @entity85 ) in @entity86 , @entity87			2
‘ it may be due to the reduced uptake of co2 by the biosphere , ' mr @entity84 told a news conference , but said more research is needed			2
‘ if that is confirmed , it is of significant concern			0
’ this same conversion produced an overall global cooling of about 0.1 ° @entity104 however , the overall global climate still warmed by about 0.6 ° c , mostly due to increases in fossil fuel carbon dioxide emissions			1
professor @entity45 said the findings do not suggest that increased forest loss provides climate change benefits			0
instead she claims it underscores the complexity of climate change and the importance of better assessing which parts of the world would benefit from greater forest conservation			2
since the mid- 19th century , the percentage of the planet covered by cropland has more than doubled , from 14 per cent to 37 per cent			2
since forests are far greater contributors of @entity31 emissions than crops and grasslands , this shift in land use has removed about 30 per cent of @entity130 's bvoc sources			1
not all of these compounds affect atmospheric chemistry in the same way			0
aerosols , for instance , contribute to global ' cooling ' since they generally reflect solar radiation back into space			0
that means a 50 per cent reduction in forest aerosols has actually spurred greater warming since the pre-industrial era			0
however , reductions in the potent greenhouse gases methane and ozone — which contribute to global warming - have helped deliver a net cooling effect			1
these emissions are often ignored in climate modelling because they are perceived as a ' natural ' part of the earth system , explained professor @entity45			0
' so they do n't get as much attention as human - generated emissions , such as fossil fuel @entity156 , ' she said			0
' but if we change how much forest cover exists , then there is a human influence on these emissions			0
' this same conversion produced an overall global cooling of about 0.1 ° @entity104 however , the overall global climate still warmed by about 0.6 ° c , mostly due to increases in fossil fuel carbon dioxide emissions			1

deforestation has reduced biogenic volatile organic compounds ( @entity31 )
@entity54 increase amount of short - lived climate pollutants like methane
there has been a 30 per cent decline of @entity31 between 1850 and 2000
this , scientists claims , is due to the conversion of forests to cropland
this same conversion produced an overall global cooling of about 0.1 ° c
but the overall global climate still warmed by about 0.6 ° c , study claims
