by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 wants @entity3 to be sitting top of the @entity5 on friday night and hopes that is a position they never deviate far from throughout the season			1
rovers entertain @entity10 , who were one of the three sides relegated from the @entity13 last year , at @entity14 to kick off the new domestic campaign			1
the top tier is a division @entity3 have not been in since 2012 but , after ending the previous season on a 12 - game unbeaten run and experiencing a much - welcome summer of stability , the belief is that they can follow their east @entity24 neighbours @entity25 in winning promotion			1
' we 're wanting to get promotion , be it automatic or through the play - offs ; that 's our goal , ' @entity2 told rovers.co.uk on the up ! @entity2 wants to help @entity3 back to the @entity13 this season ' it 's really everyone 's goal in this division because anyone can beat anyone			1
but i think the experience we had as a team last year gelled us well			0
we know our style and we know the way we want to play			0
hopefully we can put that into good practice this year			0
' although @entity3 finished the 2013 - 14 season with a flourish , they ultimately left themselves too much to do when it came to creeping into the play - offs			1
@entity2 , therefore , knows that it is crucial @entity54 's side begin on a brighter note this time around			1
' it sets out a marker to the rest of the league as well , ' he said			0
' we 're the first team to open the season on a friday and , who knows , we could be sitting top of the table come friday night			2
it 's important we start with a bang and put a marker down for where we go from there			2
' @entity3 discovered just how difficult the championship can be when they first dropped out of the top flight , and they would have experienced back - to - back relegations were it not for @entity73 ' goals			2
top boyo ! @entity75 's @entity10 are favourites to be promoted from the championship however , several bookmakers have @entity75 's @entity10 as favourites to win the @entity5 title , just as they did two seasons ago			1
' i think it 's a good bet , ' @entity75 , speaking at his thursday morning press conference , said of the @entity86 being tagged favourites			1
' i hope so , but then again this league is tough			0
there 's at least five or six that can look at themselves as candidates to go up			0
' @entity3 , @entity94 and @entity95 - there 's at least five or six that can go up and we play a few in the first eight games so let 's see			2
' the @entity101 has presided over a period of change ahead of his first full campaign in the hot seat , with @entity107 and @entity108 adding to a bevy of attacking options			0
the likes of @entity112 , @entity113 and @entity114 have departed , though , with @entity117 's @entity116 star @entity115 expected to follow suit			0
@entity113 ado about nothing : the @entity10 manager insists he was right to release several star players and @entity75 is adamant @entity10 made the right decision to cash in on those players			1
' when they do n't want to sign a new contract i do n't want them here anyway , ' he said			0
' i tried to convince @entity113 to sign a new contract but he wanted to play in the @entity13 so we 'll see him in 12 months			2
