@entity0 is a city that conjures up a sense of the holy , the historical and heavenly			1
the biblical city has been a magnet for pilgrims devoted to several of the world 's faiths and religions , notably @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12			1
millions flock to the ancient , religious city every year			1
but for a small percentage , their excitement induced by their close proximity to holy landmarks invokes a rare condition known as @entity0 syndrome			1
first identified in 2000 , psychologists noted religious pilgrims overcome with excitement at being in close proximity to the city 's holy places believed they were @entity29 characters			1
it is characterised by anxiety , agitation and nervousness			2
and sufferers are often consumed by a need to be clean , before donning a toga - like gown often made from hotel bed linen			1
@entity0 syndrome affects people visiting the holy city			1
it is characterised by seven stages , including anxiety , the need to be clean and performing sermons the next stage sees sufferers overcome by the need to scream , or sing out loud psalms , verses from the @entity29 , religious hymns or spirituals			1
a procession or march to one of the city 's holy places , is then finally followed by the delivery of a ' sermon '			1
the condition , which was first reported in 2000 , often affects people with no history of mental health problems , @entity58 reports			1
however , in many other cases , experts believe the condition is likely part of a broader psychosis , that is not unique to @entity0			1
@entity69 , director of psychology training at the @entity70 in @entity71 , told livescience : ' you see things like this emerge periodically in the literature , where people think they have found a unique syndrome			2
' but , he said , it may simply be the result of an underlying mental illness			2
a study , published in the @entity84 , noted that since 1980 , @entity0 's psychiatrists had encountered an ever - increasing number of tourists who , upon arriving in the city ' suffer psychotic decompensation '			1
a study published in the @entity92 identified seven sequential stages of @entity0 syndrome : 1			1
anxiety , agitation , nervousness and tension , and other unspecified reactions			0
declaration of the desire to split away from the group or the family and to tour @entity0 alone			0
tourist guides aware of the @entity0 syndrome and of the significance of such declarations may at this point refer the tourist to our institution for psychiatric evaluation in an attempt to pre-empt the subsequent stages of the syndrome			0
a need to be clean and pure , an obsession with taking baths and showers and compulsive fingernail and toenail cutting			2
preparation , often with the aid of hotel bed linen , of a long , ankle - length , togalike gown , which is always white			1
the need to scream , shout , or sing out loud psalms , verses from the @entity29 , religious hymns or spirituals			1
manifestations of this type serve as a warning to hotel personnel and tourist guides , who should then attempt to have the tourist taken for professional treatment			0
failing this , the two last stages will develop			0
a procession or march to one of @entity0 's holy places			1
delivery of a ‘ sermon ’ in a holy place			1
the sermon is usually very confused and based on an unrealistic plea to humankind to adopt a more wholesome , moral , simple way of life			2
as a result of noting ' the consistently high incidence of this phenomenon ' , a decision was taken to channel all cases to one central facility - the @entity158			1
there patients received psychological counselling , psychiatric intervention and , if deemed necessary , admission to hospital			0
over a 13 - year period , from 1980 to 1993 , 1,200 tourists with severe mental illness invoked by @entity0 , were referred to the facility			2
of these , 470 were admitted to hospital			0
on average , the study found 100 such tourists were seen by experts annually , with 40 a year requiring admission to hospital			2
through the course of their study , the researchers identified three types of people affected by @entity0 syndrome			2
the first included individuals already diagnosed as having a mental health illness before visiting @entity182			0
those patients were found to strongly identify with characters from the @entity185			0
the study referenced one example of an @entity189 tourist suffering paranoid schizophrenia , who believed he was the biblical character @entity191			0
he visited @entity182 because he was compelled to move one of the giant stone blocks forming the @entity195 which , in his opinion , was not in the right place			0
on arriving at the @entity199 , he attempted to move one of the stones			0
but his actions instigated a commotion , which resulted in his being admitted to the @entity158			0
the second group includes those people with personality disorders and obsessions with fixed ideas , but who do not have a clear mental illness			0
researchers cited the case of a healthy @entity215 man who was obsessed with finding the ' true ' religion , and travelled to @entity0 to study @entity217			0
he ended up suffering a psychotic episode in the @entity220 , built on the site where @entity222 is believed to have been crucified and buried			0
three types of patient were identified , the first group being those with already underlying mental illness			2
one example was of an @entity189 tourist suffering paranoid schizophrenia , who believed he was the biblical character @entity191			0
he visited @entity182 because he was compelled to move one of the giant stone blocks forming the @entity195 , pictured , which , in his opinion , was not in the right place and the third type of patient , identified in the study , were those with no history of mental illness , but who experienced a psychotic episode while in the city			1
this group recovered spontaneously after leaving @entity182			0
of the 1,200 patients examined , just 42 fell into the third category			0
despite the study , the notion of @entity0 has been condemned by a number of experts			2
dr @entity253 , of @entity71 's @entity254 , told @entity58 he believes the condition may happen when a person who is at risk of psychosis experiences the stress of travelling to another country			1
' i think what happens is , vulnerable people can be inspired by the circumstances around them , ' he said			0
dr @entity69 , agreed the condition may not be unique to @entity0			2
' if it was purely causal , you would expect everybody who visits @entity0 to get it , ' he said .			0

experts first identified the rare condition in 2000 , noting seven *symptoms*
sufferers first appear anxious and agitated and are consumed by a need to be clean before donning a toga - like gown often made from bed linen
they are then overcome by the need to scream verses from the @entity29
a procession to one of the city 's holy places is followed by them delivering a ' sermon ' in public
