a @entity1 couple have been rescued from their locked car ' close to death ' because they thought the remote device - which they did not have - was the only way to get out			1
for close to 13 hours @entity9 and @entity10 sounded the @entity12 car horn and tried to smash the windows with a car jack as they sat trapped in the vehicle that was parked in the garage of their home in @entity19 , on the @entity20			1
the elderly couple had been led to believe that only the remote control would open the doors - not realising that a simple catch by the door handle would have freed them , reports @entity27			1
for close on 13 hours @entity9 and @entity28 sounded the horn and tried to smash the windows of their new @entity12 , believing they were trapped inside when the couple were finally freed by neighbours the following morning mrs @entity34 was unconscious because they had used up all the air in the car and her husband was struggling to breathe			1
she told the paper today that they had learned from emergency services that if they had spent another half an hour in the car they could have died			2
they said they believed there was no way to get out if the doors were locked and they did not have the remote control device with them			2
they swung a car jack against the windows , hoping to break out , without success and sounded the horn after realising they could not open the doors at seven o'clock in the evening , but no - one came to help			1
it was only the following morning that neighbours found them and called for an ambulance			0
mrs @entity34 was so ill and distressed that she spent three days in hospital			1
the elderly couple had been led to believe that only the remote control would open the doors - not realising that a simple catch by the door handle would have freed them mr @entity10 told the @entity27 paper that he considered himself ' very methodical ' but he could not work out how to open the doors without the remote control device			1
' once i found out how simple it was to unlock it i kicked myself that i did not find the way out , ' he told the @entity27 paper			0
' i had this mind - set that i did not have the transponder ( so i could not get out )			0
' he said the car salesperson had made it seem the car would not work without the transponder			2
but he said he now knew that the manual lock was the same as the inside door handle on many other vehicles			0
and he had a message for the owners of other ' keyless ' cars and not just @entity90 : ' educate yourselves on how to operate your car before using it			2
' his wife said she had decided to speak out because people needed to be aware of the risks of keyless cars , particularly older people inexperienced in new technology			0
mrs @entity34 told the paper that she had received phone calls from about five other people reporting similar experiences with keyless cars			1
but mr @entity105 , @entity106 's general manager , said the report of the couple being trapped in the car in that manner was an industry first			2
' it 's not a design flaw with the car , ' he told the paper			0
' what we have said to the network is , with the new technologies , do n't forget to show customers how to use them in their entirety and how to override them			0
' there is always a manual process to override them			0
' he added that the company ' completely empathised ' with the couple and wanted to ensure what they had experienced did not happen to anyone else .			0
