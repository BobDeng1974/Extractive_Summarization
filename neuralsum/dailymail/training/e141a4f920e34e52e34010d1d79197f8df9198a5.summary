by @entity0 published : 19:07 est , 24 january 2014 updated : 07:45 est , 25 january 2014 spiralling : director general @entity2 will be told @entity3 must pick up cost of free tv licences for the elderly the @entity3 will be told to pick up the spiralling cost to taxpayers of providing free tv licences to the elderly under plans being drawn up by the conservatives			1
the bill for keeping licences free for the over- 75s has risen to £ 600million , and an ageing population means that one in six households now gets the benefit regardless of income			1
there is growing controversy over the cost of pensioner benefits , which have been left untouched by the government despite deep cuts to working - age welfare			0
the @entity25 has learned that senior ministers are planning to tell the @entity3 it must absorb the annual cost of maintaining one of the main pensioner perks			2
currently , the annual cost is met by the @entity31			0
it is thought that the plans will enrage the @entity3 , which has previously warned the government that any attempts to cut its budget could result in the loss of channels such as @entity39 or @entity40			0
free tv licences for the over- 75s were introduced to win over the ‘ grey vote ’ by @entity45 in the 2001 election			1
@entity46 pledged to maintain universal pensioner benefits – including the tv licence , the winter fuel allowance and free bus passes – until 2015			1
but there are tensions in the @entity53 over whether to maintain the commitment beyond the next election			0
work and pensions secretary @entity56 has been pushing for a review , and the @entity58 have insisted they will not agree to further cuts to working - age welfare proposed by the @entity61 – such as limits on housing benefit for under - 25s and an end to child benefits for jobless families with more than two children – unless the costs of universal pensioner benefits are also slashed			0
three @entity72 ministers have privately told the @entity25 that forcing the @entity3 to pick up the cost for over- 75 licences would allow the government to say that while the benefit is to be maintained , taxpayers will save big sums			2
‘ the bill for this should be met by the @entity3 and it will be top of the list in the negotiations over charter renewal , ’ said one			2
the number of homes claiming a free over- 75 licence has soared by more than a million since 2001 to 4.25million , while the cost to the taxpayer has more than doubled from £ 308million to over £ 600million			1
increases in longevity suggest that the cost will double again by 2030 , when the average person is forecast to live long enough to be able to claim a free licence for more than a decade			0
work and @entity95 secretary @entity56 has pushed for a review universal pensioner benefits - including the tv licence , the winter fuel allowance and free bus passes the move to land the @entity3 with the cost of maintaining free tv licences will pitch the government into a row with the corporation , which will claim the cost could be absorbed only if it saves money by closing some services			1
the £ 600million - a - year cost roughly matches the entire £ 575million budget of @entity111			1
@entity3 insiders have already claimed that an extension of a six - year licence fee freeze imposed by the government until 2016 would be impossible to manage			2
but ministers point to inflated salaries for executives and presenters , and vast pay - offs to departing staff , as evidence that the corporation can afford to make savings			0
ministers are unlikely to agree to any significant increase in the licence fee , which raises £ 3.6billion a year to fund the @entity3 ’s activities			1
the @entity128 fought ‘ tooth and nail ’ against a move to force it to meet the cost of free licences for over- 75s when it was previously considered in 2010			1
@entity3 executives will argue that the broadcaster should not be asked to pay for a perk that it did not introduce or ask to be introduced			2
the current @entity3 charter expires in 2016 , and talks on the future of its funding will begin soon			0
@entity72 mp @entity142 , chairman of the @entity143 , suggested that asking the taxpayer to pay for the provision of free tv licences for wealthy pensioners can not be justified			1
he says the issue should be considered as part of a wider review of how the @entity3 is funded			0
‘ it ’s very difficult to justify why my mother does n’t have to pay a licence fee , ’ he said			0
‘ means testing it would be administratively more complicated but in the present climate i can see no real reason why it remains a universal benefit			0

@entity3 may have to foot the £ 600million bill for free tv licenses for over- 75s
ageing population means one in six households no longer pay for licence
