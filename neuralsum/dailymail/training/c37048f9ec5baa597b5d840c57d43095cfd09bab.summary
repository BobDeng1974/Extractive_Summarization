by @entity0 for @entity1 the @entity4 released more than 600 criminal aliens into the @entity6 amid a budget shortfall in 2013 , an audit of the department released today revealed			1
the year - long investigation found that @entity9 released 2,226 illegal immigrants in february 2013 just before the sequestration went into effect in an effort to cut costs			1
on the weekend of february 23 alone , the inspector general report says @entity9 released 1,450 illegal immigrants			1
conservative news website @entity17 , which first obtained the audit , reports that 617 of the aliens released were criminals whose detention was mandatory			1
the surge of @entity24 illegally entering the country throughout the last two years has overwhelmed @entity27 and @entity28 officials			0
an audit of @entity9 found that it released 2,226 detainees , including 617 criminals , last year in the face of a budget shortfall the @entity35 and @entity36 areas saw the largest number of criminals releases , while the largest total number of immigrant releases occurred in the @entity36 and @entity42 areas the @entity35 and @entity36 areas saw the largest number of criminals releases , while the largest total number of immigrant releases occurred in the @entity36 and @entity42 areas			1
immigration officials ' did not release aliens they considered a danger to the community , ' however , the audit states			0
while @entity9 initially told @entity50 that the releases were tied to budget cuts caused by the sequestration the @entity55 's @entity54 says the agency was already facing a $ 90 million budget shortfall			1
' @entity9 did not anticipate the potential consequences of its decision to release 1,450 immigration detainees over one weekend , ' the watchdog agency 's report states			1
' as a result , @entity9 was unprepared to respond to congressional inquiries about the detainee releases and provided incorrect data			0
' according to the report , @entity9 secretly ran into financial trouble after the @entity6 border with @entity70 began being inundated by @entity24 immigrants			2
between fiscal year 2011 and 2012 the number of illegal immigrants captured in the @entity75 area of @entity76 rose by 66 percent , the report states			1
' @entity9 executive leadership did not plan adequately for increased @entity81 apprehensions on the southern border in the @entity75 , ' the audit found			2
compounding the issue is that the same area saw a 139 percent increase in @entity87 arrivals			0
non-mexican immigrants take longer for @entity9 to process because they must have certain travel documents and have to be flown home			2
@entity70 immigrants can be immediately deported and bused home			0
@entity50 requires @entity9 to be able to hold 34,000 immigrants at all times , but only provides funding for 31,300 detainees , or beds , as immigration officials say			2
the rest of @entity9 's funding comes from other , less reliable means , the report explains			2
' this funding structure leaves ice with inadequate resources when there is an increase in detainees , ' it said , noting in its recommendations that @entity9 needs to request of @entity50 funding for the total amount of beds it needs			0
the @entity113 audit state that each bed costs ice $ 122 a day , or $ 4.15 million a day or 34,000 detainees			0
if @entity9 maintains the bare minimum detainee population at its facilities , that makes for a grand total of $ 1.5 billion a year			0
deporting @entity87 illegal immigrants takes longer , causing pile ups at @entity9 detention centers the influx of illegal immigrants put @entity9 over its legally required capacity at 35,610 beds at the beginning of 2013 , causing a budget shortfall just as additional budget cuts from sequestration were scheduled to kick in			1
@entity9 had intended to meet its budgetary obligations by releasing even more illegal immigrants and reducing it 's number of detainees to 25,700 , but @entity50 informed the agency of the 34,000 requirement			1
the @entity54 says that @entity9 then asked the @entity137 for $ 22 million in additional funding , but before it could make a final decision @entity9 secretly released the 2,226 illegal immigrants without permission from its parent agency , the @entity55			1
because @entity9 's ' detention population included few detainees whose detention was not mandatory and who did not have criminal convictions , ' many criminals were included in the release , the inspector general audit released today found			1
other non-criminals ' were not suitable for release ' the report said			0
' this caseload included national security and extradition cases , aliens awaiting sentencing in criminal cases , and aliens already scheduled for removal ' after the initial release , @entity9 reportedly redetained 54 aliens but did not say why			2
the @entity163 first reported the massive discharge of detainees in early march , a charge that homeland security secretary @entity167 denied , claiming that hundreds , not thousands , of aliens were released			0
later that month , @entity9 director @entity170 publicly admitted that the number did run in the thousands			0
' we were trying to live within the budget that @entity50 had provided us , ' he told @entity50			0
' this was not a @entity177 call			0
