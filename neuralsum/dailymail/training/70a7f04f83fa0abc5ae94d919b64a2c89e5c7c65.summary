by @entity0 a @entity2 advert has been banned for being ' misleading ' after passengers booking direct flights found there was a stopover on the journey they had chosen			1
advertising watchdogs said the airline must make sure that , if a direct flight included stops , passengers should be given ' clear and prominent ' information			1
two travellers complained to the @entity16 about an advert on the firm 's website regarding a return trip from @entity21 to @entity22			1
travellers complained to the @entity16 about an advert on the @entity2 website which was ruled ' misleading ' @entity26 said : ' outbound direct flights ' and ' outbound connecting flight options			1
' after booking under the first heading , they discovered a stop was actually scheduled , however it was allowed to be classed as a ' direct ' flight as the passengers would n't disembark			0
the @entity16 said it was accepted by airlines that a ' direct ' flight might include stops , while a ' non-stop ' flight meant no landings during the journey			2
in a ruling which is also likely to apply to other airlines , the industry watchdog said the advert breached rules that marketing material should not mislead customers and should state significant limitations			0
' we considered that the existence and number of en - route stops during a flight would impact upon travel time , convenience and , in some cases , comfort , ' said an @entity16 statement			2
' it was therefore likely to be a significant factor influencing a consumer 's response to a marketing claim			0
' flights to @entity22 were advertised as ' direct ' which the @entity16 ruled misleading ' we considered that , where a flight was described as ' direct ' but included intermediate landings , that claim should be accompanied by clear and prominent information as to the number and location of en - route stops , ' the @entity16 said			1
' further information should be given where it was the case that passengers would be required to disembark the aircraft			0
' in the absence of clear and prominent information about the en - route stop , we considered that the use of the claim ' outbound direct flights ' to describe a flight from @entity21 to @entity22 that included an intermediate landing point was likely to mislead consumers and was in breach of the code			1
' it said the advert should not appear again in its current form			0
@entity2 had been able to class the route to @entity22 as ' direct ' as passengers did n't disembark from the plane during the stop ' we told @entity2 to ensure that the term " direct " when used in reference to flights that included en - route stops , was accompanied by clear and prominent information about the number and location of those stops , ' the @entity16 said			1
' and , where relevant , the fact that travellers would be required to disembark the aircraft			0
' a @entity2 spokesman said that in the aviation business a ' direct ' flight might involve a stop , but would not involve passengers having to change aircraft			2
he claimed flight times and duration were clearly displayed and therefore did not believe the phrase ' outbound direct flights ' was misleading			0
information about the single stop did appear in a box when customers clicked on the flight number , he pointed out .			0
