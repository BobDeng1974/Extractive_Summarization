@entity0 decided to slowly pull off his giant scab and uploaded the video to @entity3 many of us have been tempted to pick off an itchy scab			1
but one teenager took it to a whole different level with a scab that spanned the entire length of his arm , filming as he went			1
the video , not for the faint - hearted , captures the moment @entity0 slowly peels the giant scab off his arm , revealing raw and weeping skin beneath			1
mr @entity0 acquired the wound - that covered most of his upper arm - when he fell off his motorbike while travelling through @entity22			1
the painful - looking scab is yellow - brown and crusty , with raised bits towards the centre and patches of pink , healed skin emerging at the top			1
mr @entity0 decided to pull off the scab , watched by a group of jeering friends , and upload it to @entity3			1
‘ it ’s coming off very easily , ’ he says , laughing			0
‘ it does n’t hurt , it ’s good			0
’ the thin , yellow piece of scab peels away from the skin easily , catching slightly around the outline of the wound			1
unhealed wet skin is revealed beneath and he holds the green flap of scab tissue , which is still intact , up to the camera			1
however , dermatologists have warned that picking scabs in this way leaves a person prone to infection			1
in worst cases , this could lead bacteria - causing gangrene to get into the cut , and the person might eventually risk amputation			1
bacteria could also get into the bloodstream and travel around the body to other organs like the liver , heart or brain			0
it may also take longer for the wound to heal , and lead to unsightly scarring in the future			1
scabs form in order to stop a cut from bleeding and to prevent harmful bacteria from getting into the body			0
when a person gets cut , the cells nearby release signals			0
one signal brings immune cells - white blood cells which travel around in the blood waiting for an attack - to the area to fight off any bacteria trying to get in through the cut			1
some , called macrophages , can ‘ bite ’ holes in bacteria to kill them , while others ‘ eat ’ them and digest them with acids			0
others , called @entity90 , make proteins called antibodies which surround the bacteria with helper cells and summon ‘ killer ’ cells to destroy them			0
the other signal the body sends out when a person gets cut , is for blood cells called platelets to rise from the bloodstream to the cut			0
the platelets stick together and react with clotting factor proteins to build a clot			0
the clot is made from fibrin , a stringy protein that stretches across the wound , pulling the edges together and plugs the gap between them			0
dr @entity114 , a consultant dermatologist at @entity115 , @entity116 , advises not to pick a scab			1
here , he explains why … ‘ a scab one level acts as protection against external agents and infection			1
‘ producing a scab is nature ’s way of creating a protective environment			1
‘ underneath , wound healing is taking place			1
‘ if you take a scab off too quickly , there ’s an increased risk of secondary infection			1
‘ worst case scenario is gangrene , it ’s unlikely			0
someone with an impaired immune system or diabetes is at an increased risk of gangrene			0
‘ most people are at risk of staphylococcus , a common bacteria , which causes infection			1
‘ @entity147 gets into the wound and causes localised infection			1
‘ you may have had an impact on the process of wound healing			1
you could lead to an increase risk of scarring			2
‘ we would not advise picking scabs			0
you ’re impacting on nature ’s natural healing			2
‘ there is one exception			0
in leg ulcers , a scab can be so thick and causing contraction of the wound			2
very occasionally a dermatologist would choose to remove a scab			2
‘ that ’s rare , and the general advice is to not pick scabs			0
’ this helps to stop bleeding , and prevents bacteria from getting in			0
the scab will then fall off of its own accord when the wound has healed and the skin underneath has re-grown , dermatologists advise			1
dr @entity114 , a consultant dermatologist at @entity115 , @entity116 , said a scab is ' nature 's way of creating a protective environment '			2
he strongly advised against picking it			0
he said : ‘ underneath , wound healing is taking place			2
