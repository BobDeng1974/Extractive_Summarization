by @entity0 @entity1 's infamous @entity2 - criticised for years for its high levels of pollution - could house the city 's newest public attraction ; a floating , cross-shaped public pool filled with filtered river water			1
artist impressions have been released showing the stunning pool , which is attached to the @entity14 shoreline via a floating wooden walkway , floating beneath the famed @entity17 skyline			0
the @entity14 - based design team has said it intends to build the @entity20 - sized pool in the @entity2 , using special filters to transform the water into something locals would swim in			1
developers of the so - called @entity26 say they hope it will open by summer 2016 , although the $ 15milion project must first win approval from @entity1 officials and the @entity31			1
the pool would use special filters to transform the sickly green water into something locals can swim in the @entity26 would be anchored to the river bed and have a walkway to shore			1
although plans show it being built in the much - maligned @entity2 , the exact location of the development is still to be determined unappealing : @entity1 's @entity2 has long been in need of a makeover			2
often smelly and dirty , the river has a place in @entity1 folklore as a supposed dumping ground for the victims of mafia murders project co-founder @entity53 pitched the @entity2 pool - which plans show sitting on the @entity14 shore - as being clean , safe and good for the environment and public perception			1
he said he hopes to ' change the way @entity1 see the river by giving them a chance to swim in it			0
' a city spokesman did not respond to questions on what permits may be required to build the pool , and did not say how the city feels towards privately built facilities that are intended for public use			0
developers said it would be different from other floating pools in @entity1 - there has been one at @entity75 in the @entity76 since 2007 - because it is designed to filter and use river water			1
the @entity26 would be anchored to the river bed and have a walkway to shore , although the exact location of where it will be built is still to be determined , the developers added			0
great views : if built the floating pool would be open to all members of the public and would feature areas designed for children , lanes for lap swimmers and pool - side loungers project spokeswoman @entity94 said there have been talks about several permanent locations for the @entity26 , including @entity98			1
ideally , she said , the pool would find a home in the @entity2 , although the @entity101 and @entity102 have been put forward as alternatives			2
co-founder @entity104 said the @entity26 would be built from filtration material that can remove bacteria and contaminants from a 2,300 litres of polluted river water every day			2
that clean water would be then be recycled back into the river after being used in the pool , he said			0
more than 3,000 people have already contributed nearly $ 275,000 to a @entity114 campaign to develop the pool			0
location : ideally the pool would find a home in the @entity2 ( pictured ) , although the @entity101 and @entity102 have been put forward as alternatives by developers supporters can also sponsor one of the pool 's 70,000 tiles for $ 25 , $ 199 or $ 249			1
if each tile is sponsored , that alone would cover the $ 15million cost to build the pool			1
if realised the pool would be open to all members of the public and would feature areas designed for children , lanes for lap swimmers and pool - side loungers for those looking to take it easy			2
a small admission fee may be required to pay for the cost of maintenance , security and lifeguards , although the developers are also looking into the possibility of this being covered by sponsorship			0
innovative : developers said the @entity26 would be different from others in @entity1 because it is designed to use river water			2
there has been a floating pool at @entity75 in the @entity76 since 2007 ( pictured ) the pool 's developers say they are currently testing and improving the proposed filtration system using a floating laboratory at @entity158 in the @entity101			1
they said they are also monitoring the river and intend to partner with @entity161 to launch an app that broadcasts water quality data in real time			0
the @entity2 has long been in need of an environmental and public relations makeover			0
@entity168 , dirty and , whenever sewage and storm water back up , dangerous , the river has a place in @entity1 folklore as a supposed dumping ground for the victims of mafia murders			0
the television series @entity177 mocked the @entity2 in a 1997 episode when the character @entity179 tried swimming in it and was mistaken for a dead body .			0

developers hope to build large floating pool in the much - maligned river
special filters are being designed to clean river water for use in the pool
project is expected to cost $ 15million , using money *raised* on @entity114
but city officials still need to approve the plans if pool is to open by 2016
@entity101 or @entity102 could be used an alternative location
