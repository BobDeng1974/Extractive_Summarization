by @entity1 reporter published : 11:20 est , 21 march 2012 updated : 12:38 est , 21 march 2012 after sitting on the sidelines for much of the primary season , former @entity3 governor @entity2 is endorsing @entity6 to become the @entity8 's presidential nominee			1
@entity2 made the announcement in a statement released today after @entity6 's win in the @entity13 primary by 12 points last night			1
@entity2 congratulated @entity6 on his success and urged republicans to ' unite ' behind the former @entity17 governor			1
' primary elections have been held in thirty - four states , and now is the time for @entity8 to unite behind governor @entity6 and take our message of fiscal conservatism and job creation to all voters this fall			1
' confirming that he was endorsing @entity6 , he continued that the country was facing ' huge challenges '			2
' we need a leader who understands the economy , recognizes more government regulation is not the answer , believes in entrepreneurial capitalism and works to ensure that all @entity48 have the opportunity to succeed			0
' victory lap : @entity6 celebrates with his wife @entity51 won @entity13 by a wide margin - his third big industrial state victory against @entity54 distant second : @entity54 spent the last week defending himself against gaffes and self - inflicted injuries despite big losses on @entity59 and in the @entity60 last week , @entity6 retains a massive advantage in the number of convention delegates			1
if he continues at this pace , he will reach the 1,144 needed to clinch the @entity8 presidential nomination at the @entity8 convention in august			2
( all numbers exclude tuesday 's win , which offers 59 delegates awarded by congressional district			0
) @entity6 : 522 victories : @entity72 , @entity3 , @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity17 , @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 , the @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity89 @entity54 : 253 victories : @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity97 , @entity98 and @entity99 @entity100 : 135 victories : @entity102 and @entity103 @entity104 : 50 victories : none until now , @entity2 , who is the brother of former president @entity107 , had declined to endorse a candidate , including during the @entity3 primary , during which he told @entity110 he would ' stay neutral '			1
' he has been watching the race and made the decision to endorse this morning			0
he called gov. @entity6 this morning , ' a @entity2 spokesman told @entity114			1
only last month , @entity2 had criticized the rhetoric being used in the @entity8 presidential debates saying he found it ' a little troubling ' as candidates appeared to appealing to people 's ' fears and emotion ' rather than political concerns			1
the victory last night was an important one because it was in a @entity126 state , it followed a double loss to @entity54 in the @entity60 last week and it extended @entity6 â€™s delegate lead making it all but mathematically impossible his rivals achieve the 1,144 needed for outright victory			1
@entity6 had emailed his supporters tuesday night that his @entity13 win ' means we are that much closer to securing the nomination , uniting our party , and taking on president @entity22			2
' he urged the party to fall in line behind his bid , saying ' we are almost there			0
' polls show @entity6 has the advantage heading toward @entity144 's april 3 primary			2
but the @entity60 , where @entity145 votes on saturday , has proven less hospitable to @entity6			2
as well as @entity146 , @entity54 expects to win in the @entity145 and then @entity147 and @entity148 on may 22			0
he has also set his sights on a big win in @entity151 , which offers 155 delegates and which holds a primary on may 29			0
key win : while @entity6 's victory in @entity13 will not end the @entity8 primary , his wide margin has greatly bolstered his status as front - runner all eyes on @entity13 : the primary in the heavily - @entity163 state boiled down to a contest between @entity6 and @entity54 @entity54 sounded like anything but a defeated contender tuesday night as he spoke to supporters in @entity168			1
he said he had outpolled @entity6 in downstate @entity13 and the areas " that conservatives and republicans populate			0
" ' we 're very happy about that and we 're happy about the delegates we 're going to get , too , ' he said before invoking @entity13 - born @entity8 icon @entity175 , the actor turned president			0
' saddle up , like @entity175 did in the cowboy movies			0
' @entity179 did n't speak to supporters tuesday , instead putting out a written statement			0
@entity151 rep. @entity104 has yet to win a state			0
@entity6 triumphed in @entity13 after benefiting from a crushing 7 - 1 advantage in the television advertising wars , and as his chief rival struggled to overcome self - imposed political wounds in the marathon race to pick an opponent to @entity22 .			2

@entity2 has up until now declined to endorse a candidate , *vowing* to stay ' neutral '
@entity6 's lead now more than double of nearest rival @entity54
all but mathematically impossible for @entity8 rivals to achieve outright victory
