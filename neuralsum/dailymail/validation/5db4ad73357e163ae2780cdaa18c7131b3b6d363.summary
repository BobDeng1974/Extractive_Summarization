@entity0 , 54 , died two days after she had her varicose veins operated on at the @entity3 and @entity4 hospital the death of a woman days after she underwent surgery on her varicose veins could have been prevented , her husband has today claimed			1
@entity0 , 54 , had the operation at the @entity3 and @entity10 in march last year and was discharged the same evening			1
but two days later the mother - of - two was found apparently asleep in her chair at the family home in @entity14 , @entity3			1
when her family failed to rouse the classroom assistant , they called an ambulance			0
despite the best efforts of the paramedics called , mrs @entity0 died			1
a post-mortem examination later confirmed she had suffered a pulmonary embolism , a blood clot which reached her lungs			1
an inquest heard staff at the hospital failed to ensure mrs @entity0 was fully aware of the risk of suffering a blood clot during the operation , because of an ' oversight '			1
her husband , @entity32 , 53 , said he is now considering taking civil action against the hospital , claiming he believes his wife 's death could have been prevented			1
the postman , who lives with the couple 's two children , said : ' they were required to avoid harming her and , tragically , in my opinion , they did not			0
' @entity3 mp @entity42 said the case was a ' tragedy ' which should prompt improvements			2
he added : ' it is clear to me that more could and should have been done to mitigate the risks of what was deemed to be appropriate surgery for @entity51 , most crucially to place mrs @entity0 and her family in a position to make a fully informed choice about whether to proceed with the operation			1
' any hospital treating over half a million people each year will occasionally not do everything perfectly			2
' but in the @entity64 world , when things have been less than perfect , patients and families now expect - and frankly are entitled to expect - much greater openness			0
' consultant vascular surgeon @entity66 admitted to the inquest in @entity4 that a thrombosis risk assessment had not been completed			1
that meant the 54 - year - old was not fully informed about the dangers of the surgery , including the increased risk for those with a high body mass index			2
nurse @entity76 said she accepted it was ' an oversight ' and that a checklist had not been completed on the patient 's discharge notes			0
coroner @entity81 gave a narrative conclusion that mrs @entity0 died following a ' rare but recognised ' risk of surgery , adding she will write a report so that future deaths may be prevented			1
she said she was satisfied that the operation itself had been conducted appropriately			0
but raised concerns that mrs @entity0 had not been given the correct leaflets on her care			2
speaking after the inquest mr @entity51 said his family 's lives had been ' damaged beyond repair '			0
he described his wife and his ' happy , smiling soul - mate '			0
mrs @entity0 's husband , @entity98 , 53 , who lives with the couple 's two children , said he believes his wife 's death could have been prevented a post mortem examination revealed mrs @entity0 died of a pulmonary embolism , a blood clot in her lungs he added : ' @entity107 was a happy , smiling , laughing , easy going , fun loving person all of her life			1
' she was someone who loved , cared for , guided , supported and helped so many people throughout her life			0
' in my opinion , the @entity3 and @entity4 would have done nothing to learn the lessons from my wife 's death , and to materially revise their protocols and procedures , which they have subsequently done , without my formal complaint and , even after that , without the very considerable pressure i have placed upon them , both personally and through other organisations			1
' in the @entity124 thousands of patients die a preventable death every year from hospital acquired venous thromboembolism			2
' many thousands more have to live with the life changing consequences			0
' that , in my opinion , is a national scandal			0
' a hospital spokeswoman expressed sympathy to the @entity51 family			0
she added : ' mrs @entity0 died of a rare but recognised complication of surgery , estimated to occur in approximately 0.01 per cent of cases , in other words one in 10,000 patients			1
' while it is possible to reduce the risks of surgery they can never be eliminated entirely			2
' the trust commissioned an independent review in order to identify any ways in which we could improve our services			0
' once we have the coroner 's recommendations we will review these to identify any further opportunities for improvement			0
' lawyer @entity155 , of @entity156 which represented the family , said : ' my client and his family are understandably devastated beyond words at their loss			0
' they have many questions relating to the hospital 's protocols concerning blood clotting risks			2
' an inquest heard how a pre-surgery risk assessment was not completed , meaning mrs @entity0 was not fully aware of the risks of suffering a blood clot during her operation			1
