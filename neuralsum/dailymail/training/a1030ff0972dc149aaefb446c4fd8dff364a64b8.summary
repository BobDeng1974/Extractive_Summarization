by @entity0 modern love : @entity2 sought out the help of @entity6 ' @entity5 account after finding the man of her dreams on a flight , but missing his last name a @entity12 woman who decided a guy she met on a flight was the man of her dreams managed to reconnect with him despite forgetting his name thanks to @entity5			1
@entity17 had some help from the kind folks at @entity6 , who she initially tweeted at to help her in her quest			1
they were slow to lend a hand , but when they did her message went viral			2
' @entity26 : just got off my flight with my future husband , but did n't catch his full name , ' @entity2 tweeted in the first of a string of correspondences with the airline			1
@entity2 , who founded a do - it - yourself company called @entity36 - i made this , was on her way from @entity39 to @entity40			1
' @entity41 , ' she asked @ @entity42			2
at first , @entity6 did not			1
they responded , but only to the tune of ' best of luck			2
' @entity2 kept pressuring them			1
' @ @entity42 what happened 2 romance ? i 'm just a girl , standin in front of the world , asking an airline to help her ( 2 quote @entity54 )			0
' and her persistence paid off			0
the airline declined to directly contact the mystery man , but they did give @entity60 a platform that reaches over 780,000 followers on which to ask the public for help			2
' @ @entity42 he was sitting in the front row first class wearing a blue sweater , his name is @entity70			0
he was born in @entity71 & lives in soho , ' she wrote			0
they refused , but when she persisted , they finally gave in a little and let her use their public conversation as a platform 780,000 followers strong for finding love @entity81 takes flight : while things did n't go smoothly for @entity2 at first , she eventually found her wings ( and her guy ) while thousands saw the tweet , and no doubt asked themselves if they knew a @entity70 from @entity71 , it was a real - life friend of @entity2 's who led her to her dream man			1
he was spotted in an @entity94 store and one thing led to another			0
' to close the book on this story			0
the universe brought us together & he 's amazing			2
# romance @entity105 , ' she wrote			0
she then went on the further detail her success , though exactly where things now stand remains unclear			0
' @ @entity42 all i an say : i 'm grateful to @entity112 , my @ @entity120 ( w / his photo ) & friend i saw @ @entity117 who knew him xo , ' she wrote coyly			0
@entity6 responded : ' @ psimadethis that 's # @entity122 ! we hope you 'll live @entity125			1
invite us to the wedding , virtually of course			0
' pay off ! @entity2 's persistence and willingness to publicly air her search for a man she 'd met only briefly paid off , though she 's keeping most of the details private			1
