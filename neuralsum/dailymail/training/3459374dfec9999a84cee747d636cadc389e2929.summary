a six - week - old baby suffocated and died in his sleep after his parents took him into their bed when they returned from a night out			1
@entity4 , 24 , and 22 - year - old @entity5 put their son @entity6 in a @entity8 basket next to their bed when they arrived back at their home in @entity13 , @entity14 , at 3.30am on may 31			1
when @entity6 woke up crying at 5am , mr @entity4 took him from the basket , fed him and carried him into their bed , where he cradled the young boy between him and @entity6 's mother until he fell asleep			1
@entity19 ( pictured left and right ) died aged six weeks after suffocating in his parents ' bed in @entity13 when they returned from a night out with friends but four hours later , mr @entity4 woke up to find his son lying unconscious , with blood coming from his nose			1
mr @entity4 immediately called an ambulance , but @entity6 was pronounced dead at @entity28			1
at an inquest into the baby 's death , a doctor called @entity6 's death a ' tragedy ' and warned other parents of the dangers of sleeping with their babies in their bed			1
@entity38 heard @entity6 died from @entity39 ( @entity39 ) after being deprived of oxygen			1
but the coroner said a contributory factor in @entity6 's death was ' co-sleeping and parental alcohol consumption ' , as well as over-heating			1
after the inquest , miss @entity5 's father @entity46 called for a national campaign to raise awareness for babies in bed and alcohol consumption			1
@entity6 was taken to @entity53 ( pictured ) after his father found him unconscious , but he was pronounced dead on arrival he said : ' i have brought up three children and they have been perfectly healthy and all have shared our bed			1
' it is terrible what has happened obviously and my daughter and her partner are heart - broken as are we all			0
' i would like to see a national @entity67 campaign to raise awareness for babies in bed and alcohol consumption			1
' but miss @entity5 said she had just one glass of wine before the incident unfolded			2
she said : ' we 're not big drinkers and we do n't drink a lot			0
sudden infant death syndrome describes the unexpected death of a baby or toddler that is initially unexplained			0
cot death was a term commonly used in the past			0
it has largely been abandoned , due to misleading suggestions that sudden infant death can only occur when a baby is asleep in a cot			0
causes of @entity39 may include accidents , infections , congenital abnormality or metabolic disorder			2
it is common in babies aged between six and eight weeks			0
for those deaths that remain unexplained , experts believe there are likely to be undiscovered causes			0
sids statistics : source : the @entity102 and @entity103 ' the last time we went out was on holiday - a year before i had the baby			2
we just wanted to go out for a bit - i only had a glass of wine			0
' the inquest heard how an initial joint paediatric and forensic post-mortem was carried out at @entity112			2
neither could find a cause of death			2
consultant paediatrician dr @entity116 told the court the incident had been a ' tragedy ' at the no - one had been ' at fault '			0
he said tests had shown there were no abnormalities in the baby 's organs , which pointed towards @entity127 syndrome			0
but the doctor also said that the parents ' decision to co-sleep with their baby and having consumed alcohol might have contributed to their baby 's death			2
he said : ' this was a tragedy and there is nobody as fault but i believe it is important to know the etymology of @entity39			2
' these are contributory factors because we do n't know the ultimate cause of @entity39			1
i pass my condolences on to the family			0
' it was clear to me when i went to see them that nobody did anything wrong or deliberate			0
it was an unfortunate tragedy			0
' dr @entity153 had told the hearing that there had been a number of contributing factors to @entity6 's death			1
he said : ' the not deliberate and unfortunate set of circumstances is well - documented - bed sharing with parents combined with alcohol consumption			1
' furthermore one or both parents did smoke and that could be a contributory factor as that baby had a rhino viral infection			0
' there are a series of risk factors that increase the likelihood of having @entity39			1
one reason bed sharing is considered dangerous is that one parents could roll on to the infant in the middle of the night			2
' i think the most dominant would be bed sharing with two adults			0
' @entity179 would be alcohol consumption			1
alcohol enhances fatigue through the night and it could reduce the level of mental awareness in the parents			2
' he also said that over-heating is another factor that increases the chance of a baby dying of @entity39 , before adding : ' in my personal view it should be recorded as @entity39 with co-sleeping and alcohol consumption			1
' the reason i say this is that this is important			0
if we know how many cases there are with enhanced risk factors and what they are this can help with promoting a campaign for safe infant care			0
' earlier coroner 's officer @entity207 read a statement summarising the events that led up to @entity6 's death			1
he said : ' @entity6 's parents went out to socialise while his grandmother baby sat. ' the couple returned home at 3.30am the following morning and went straight to bed			1
at 5am to 5.30am @entity6 woke up crying			1
his father has made him a bottle and then placed @entity6 between himself and @entity6 's mum			2
' he has then fallen asleep and then woken by the sound of a mobile phone ringing at 8.48am			0
when he woke @entity6 was still between them			2
' he added : ' @entity6 's father noticed dry blood around his nose and on the bed			1
he noticed something was wrong			0
the emergency services were called and @entity6 was transferred to hospital			2
however he sadly passed away			0
' assistant coroner @entity230 recorded a narrative verdict , describing it as a ' tragic day ' for the family			0
he said : ' sids is considered applicable and it is likely that there are a number of contributory factors of the circumstances that have been described			0
' in order of contribution - bed sharing , parental alcohol consumption , rhino virus , smoking and over-heating			1
this is a tragic day for the family			0
