a skull dating back to the 1600s has been found in @entity2 , casting doubt over whether captain cook really was the first @entity5 to land on the east coast of the country			1
in preparation for a murder investigation , police ran carbon dating tests on the intact human skull but results showed it was a lot older than first expected			2
results found that the skull , found near @entity17 a large town about 200 miles north of @entity19 recently , could date back to the mid- 1600s , 120 years before @entity4 landed in @entity2			1
here before @entity4 ? carbon dating of this skull found in @entity2 recently suggested that the person , a white male , was born in the mid- 1600s , almost 100 years before @entity4 arrived in the country expert @entity24 from the @entity25 , who did the carbon dating , was shocked to discover the age of the artefact , which tests confirmed was the male skull of a white @entity5			1
he told @entity30 : ‘ we did n't know how old this one was			0
we assumed at first that it was going to be a very young sample			0
‘ when we first did it we were n't really thinking about people coming to @entity2 and things like that until we started to look at the dates and say , “ oh , that 's becoming intriguing ”			0
’ dr @entity41 said that carbon dating for dates after 1950 was very accurate but anything earlier was less clear			2
two samples for the skull indicated two different dates but both were within the error range			0
he suggested there was a good chance that the man was born in the mid- 1600s			1
' intriguing ' : dr @entity24 said carbon dating results suggested , with 80 per cent probability , that the skull was of a man born in the mid- 1600s which came as a shock because he thought the remains were much younger on first inspection he said : ‘ using [ the dates ] together we can do some modelling as to what we expect the calendar age to be ... and the way it works out by using those two dates is that we get about an 80 per cent probability that the person was born somewhere around the 1650s and died somewhere between 1660 and 1700			1
the other possibility , which dr @entity41 gave a one - in - five probability , was that the man was born between 1780 and 1790 , and died between 1805 and 1810			0
historians have been cautious about the discovery , suggesting it does not necessarily refute @entity4 ’s claim			2
archaeologist @entity77 said that because the skull was found without other remains , it could have been imported as part of a private collection			2
he told @entity19 ’s @entity83 : ‘ before we rewrite the history of @entity5 settlement we have to consider a number of issues , particularly the circumstances of the discovery			2
do n't rewrite history just yet : historians have been cautious with one suggesting that the skull ( right ) may have been imported to @entity2 as part of a private collection because it was found without other remains			1
captain cook ( left ) reached the east coast of @entity2 in 1770 ‘ the fact the skull is in good condition and found alone could easily point to it coming from a private collection and skulls were very popular with collectors in the 19th century			1
’ @entity105 , an @entity2 historical researcher said : ‘ if the skull does pre-date @entity109 settlement , it may be a tragic yet fascinating clue to the little - known history of early interactions between @entity113 and the outside world			0
’ detective sergeant @entity115 said : ‘ the dna determined the skull was a male and the anthropologist report states the skull is that of a caucasoid aged anywhere from 28 to 65			0
’ captain cook is thought to be the first white person to reach the east coast of @entity2 when he reached shore in april 1770			1
he declared the east @entity109 soil , four months later			0
@entity127 explorers reached the north and west coasts in the early 1600s .			0

carbon dating of the skull suggests it is of a man born in the mid- 1600s
it was found near the town of @entity17 , 200 miles north of @entity19
captain @entity4 was thought to be the first white @entity5 to reach the east cost of @entity2
historians have been cautious and suggest the relic may have been imported
