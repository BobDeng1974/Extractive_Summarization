by @entity0 published : 04:54 est , 31 january 2014 updated : 07:42 est , 31 january 2014 @entity3 the baby giraffe has not had the easiest start in life			1
the ‘ leggy brunette ’ was abandoned by her mother , and so has to be fed through a tube which is being kept in place by a bandage around her long neck			0
@entity3 was born an unusually large baby giraffe , so her mother did not see her as a calf and therefore stopped producing milk when she was born			1
@entity3 also has to be kept separate from her playmates , in order to stop the other giraffes accidentally injuring her delicate frame			2
at six - foot - high and weighing 140lbs , @entity3 was extraordinarily large for a female calf			0
her unusually tall body meant she was unable to nurse straight away , which led to her mother , @entity32 , abandoning her			0
tall order : the heart - achingly cute baby giraffe now has to be fed through a tube , which is attacked to her by a bandage around her neck leggy lady : @entity3 is being cared for by staff at @entity21 , but has to be kept from the other giraffes so they do not injure her by accident without the valuable nutrients from her mother ’s milk , @entity3 's white blood cell count became dangerously low and she contracted an infection			1
this led to the staff at the @entity51 at @entity52 in @entity53 , @entity22 to place a bandage on @entity3 's neck so she could be fed intravenously			2
visitors will be able to catch a glimpse of @entity3 when the zoo opens again on 12 april 2014 .			0
