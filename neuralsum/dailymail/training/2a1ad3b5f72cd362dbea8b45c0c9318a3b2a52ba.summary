by @entity0 published : 19:02 est , 7 november 2012 updated : 19:02 est , 7 november 2012 broadband users in one road suffer a download speed 500 times slower than those in a street enjoying the @entity8 's fastest speed , a study has found			2
@entity10 in @entity11 , @entity12 , has an average speed of @entity14 , while @entity15 , in @entity16 , has registered speeds of @entity18 over the past six months , @entity9 found			1
@entity12 has three of the top 10 slowest streets for broadband in the country with speeds around 37 times slower than the national average of @entity25 , the survey revealed			1
@entity10 in @entity11 , @entity12 , has an average speed of @entity14 making it @entity8 's slowest street for broadband the five slowest streets for average broadband speeds are : @entity31 has four of the slowest streets in the @entity8 but also boasts the third fastest - @entity33 in @entity34			1
according to the study , it would take @entity38 residents two minutes and 49 seconds to download a two hour film , and 11 seconds to download a music album , while @entity10 residents would need 25 hours and 15 minutes to download a two hour film , and one hour and 41 minutes to download the same album			1
@entity12 's @entity44 in @entity45 and @entity46 in @entity47 also registered ' negligible " ' speeds of @entity49 and @entity50 respectively			1
and @entity51 found those who live on @entity53 in @entity54 , @entity55 , ' would probably be better off sending snail mail than an email ' with an average download speed of @entity59 - the second slowest in the country			1
the third slowest is @entity62 in @entity63 , @entity64 , where speeds of @entity66 mean that downloading one song would take two minutes and 40 seconds			2
the study found a wide variation in @entity71 speeds , with @entity72 in @entity73 having an average speed of @entity75			1
@entity76 , @entity51 broadband spokeswoman , said : ' the massive discrepancy between the fastest and slowest streets in @entity8 shows what the government is up against in its fight to drag @entity8 into the broadband fastlane			0
' these results show just how ambitious it is being in its bid to overtake the rest of @entity87 and haul @entity8 in line with the likes of @entity90 and @entity91 by bringing super-fast broadband to 90 % of the @entity8			0
in the fast lane : @entity15 , in @entity16 , has registered speeds of @entity18 the five fastest streets for average broadband speeds are : ' rural parts of @entity8 in particular are still experiencing broadband speeds so slow that they might as well have no broadband at all			1
' but worryingly , the government 's superfast broadband rollout is heavily geared towards urban areas , which will only widen the rural - urban broadband gap			0
' it 's concerning that the main aim is n't providing a decent broadband service to those areas still lacking basic broadband infrastructure and bringing acceptable average speeds to those in rural areas who have been forever languishing in the slow lane			2
' however , most of @entity8 's slowest streets for broadband are not in particularly remote areas , but in small towns , nearer to exchanges and where we would expect to see higher download speeds across the board			0
' part of the problem is that @entity102 funding for superfast broadband is being dished out to councils , who do n't necessarily have a full view of the big picture			0
' she added : ' ultimately , anyone frustrated with their broadband service should test their speeds regularly online and compare the results to those of other broadband users in the same area			0
according to the study , it would take @entity38 residents two minutes and 49 seconds to download a two hour film , and 11 seconds to download a music album			0
@entity10 residents would need 25 hours and 15 minutes to download a two hour film , and one hour and 41 minutes to download the same album			2
' if the tests reveal that another provider is offering better speeds in your local area , consider switching			0
' @entity51 conducted 2,261,336 speed tests through its website between april and september 2012			0
streets had to have at least 30 registered speed tests to be included .			2

@entity10 in @entity11 , @entity12 , has an average speed of @entity14 , while @entity15 , in @entity16 , has registered speeds of @entity18 over the past six months
