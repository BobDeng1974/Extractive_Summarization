by @entity0 follow @ @ oliver_todd former referees chief @entity1 has criticised the decision that could see the @entity4 's oldest ever referee take charge of a game on opening weekend			1
@entity7 has been appointed as fourth official for @entity10 's visit to @entity11 on saturday , despite being 51 years old - and could find himself as the man in the middle if @entity14 gets injured			1
and @entity1 says that @entity15 , who choose the officials for each top flight game , are taking big risks with referees more likely to pick up injuries at the start of the new season			1
' i believe too much risk is being taken by the @entity15 management team			0
' all @entity4 refs have to pass an intensive fitness test to take charge of top flight matches - and @entity7 is not one of the 17 members of the @entity51 's @entity50			0
' ( @entity7 ) will in my opinion have difficulty in meeting the minimum 1000m at 7m per second sprint values or even get anywhere near the thirty plus sprints required to be produced to maintain contact with a @entity4 game , ' @entity1 added			0
' why is the @entity15 not appointing its select group referees to all double up over the opening weekend ? ' will mr @entity7 , born in 1960 , be able to cope with the speed and intensity requirements of a @entity4 game should he have to come on ? ' i have my doubts â€¦			2
so why expose the @entity4 games to such a high - risk strategy by not getting the @entity66 to double up ? ' man in the middle : @entity14 is the first choice ref for the game but could be replaced if he is injured			0

@entity7 is fourth official for the game at @entity71 this weekend
he could step in to the middle if @entity14 gets an injury
@entity7 , at the age of 51 , would be the @entity4 's oldest referee
@entity1 says the @entity15 , who choose the officials , are taking a risk
the former head of refs has *slammed* the decisions over fourth officials
