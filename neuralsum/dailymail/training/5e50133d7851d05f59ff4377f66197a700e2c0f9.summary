by @entity0 as the debate rages on in the @entity3 about what is most to blame for the nation 's obesity problem , a new film is claiming the real danger behind the epidemic is sugar			1
@entity10 , a film released in the @entity3 this week , predicts 95 per cent of @entity3 will be overweight or obese in the next two decades , unless something is done to tackle the so - called hidden sugars which appear in everyday foods			1
producer @entity14 - who was also behind the 2006 film @entity15 which studied the myths surrounding global warming - warns in the film that one third of adults will also have diabetes by 2050 , as our brains become increasingly dependent on sugar			1
he said : ' the message has been pushed onto us : it is your fault you 're fat			2
' dr @entity46 , a former @entity47 commissioner , goes one step father , predicting that the obesity crisis fuelled by sugar will end up as ' one of the greatest public health epidemics of our time '			1
' we are toast as a country ' , he tells the film			0
the expert comments come after researchers behind the film found that , of the 600,000 food items in the @entity3 , a staggering 80 per cent have added sugar			1
the film claims fast - food chains and the makers of processed foods add more sugar to ' low fat ' foods to make them more palatable			1
dr @entity34 , chairman for the @entity35 , tells the new film that sugar is a ' fundamental problem ' which noone is talking about but the truth about how damaging this can be for a person 's health has remained hidden behind supposedly - healthy food labels - because manufacturers need to rely on sugar to make their food , the film claims			1
according to @entity84 , an author interviewed for the film , blaming willpower for obesity - as has been the way for several years - is a ' crime '			1
' your brain lights up to sugar just as it does with cocaine and heroin , meaning you are going to become an addict ' instead , the film claims that obesity could be started by the human brain 's reaction to sugar			1
the human brain ' lights up to sugar just as it does with cocaine and heroin ' , according to one expert			0
it means people who are unwittingly eating sugar will become addicted to the ingredient			0
@entity108 , writer of the book @entity110 , also tells the film that , by not implementing laws to stop so much sugar being used , the government is ' subsiding the obesity epidemic '			1
according to the film , the problem means early - onset diabetes - a condition associated with exposure to cane sugar and corn syrup - will be a medical condition in one in three @entity3 by 2050 , if current rates continue			1
in two decades , 95 per cent of @entity3 will also be overweight or obese , according to the film			1
a study of the brain shows that humans react in the same way to sugar as they do to cocaine which causes addiction , the film says the idea that sugar , rather than fat , causes both obesity and diabetes has been gaining support among diet and health experts for the past few years			1
in january , an alliance of doctors and academics described sugar as ' the new tobacco ' , blaming it for a range of health problems and early death			1
fructose is found in fruit , sucrose ( table sugar ) and in high fructose corn syrup			0
it is a simple sugar and is sweeter than glucose			0
sucrose ( the sugar that we commonly add to food ) is made up of 50 per cent glucose and 50 per cent fructose			1
high fructose corn syrup ( containing more fructose than glucose ) commonly replaces sucrose in the @entity3 food industry because it is both sweeter and cheaper			1
in the @entity167 , it can also be labelled as ‘ glucose - fructose syrup ’ or ‘ @entity169 ’			0
because it causes a lower blood sugar spike than sucrose or glucose , and therefore has a low glycaemic index , manufacturers are allowed to claim that fructose is ‘ healthier ’ than the other two			0
but some scientists claim the problem with fructose is twofold			0
firstly , there is no hormone to remove fructose from our bloodstream ( unlike glucose , which stimulates insulin production )			0
it is therefore left to the liver to remove it			0
when the liver is overwhelmed it converts fructose to liver fat , which ups our chances of developing insulin resistance ( a precursor to diabetes ) , hardened arteries and heart disease			2
secondly , fructose suppresses the hormone leptin , which tells you when you ’re full			0
in other words , your brain lets you consume it without limit			0
a @entity3 study last year carried out by the @entity206 found that for every 150 calories of extra sugar people had each day , the prevalence of diabetes in the country rose by 1 per cent in the population			1
@entity213 , a columnist for the @entity214 , supports this point , telling the film how junk food companies are acting like ' tobacco companies were 30 years ago '			2
the claims about sugar come after some scientists say illnesses that typically show up in the obese are also apparent in those who have average weight			0
scientists claim this must be due to exposure to sugar			0
but efforts to curb the sugar industry have largely failed			0
in the @entity3 , the @entity231 administration threatened to withhold funding to the @entity233 in 2003 , if it published nutritional guidelines which suggested no more than 10 per cent of calories per day should come from sugar			1
campaigners are now calling for health warnings on some foods , as well as equal advertising time to marketing fresh fruit and vegetables			2
they also want voluntary agreements to reduce sugar content			0
the problem is particularly apparent in low - fat versions of foods such as yoghurts , fizzy drinks and spreads , in which natural sugars are swapped for sugar substitutes			2
but many other leading scientists say there is not yet enough evidence to prove sugar has the harmful effect some campaigners are claiming			0
@entity259 @entity167 said the @entity233 published a review last year that found that any link between diabetes and body weight was due to over-consumption of calories and was not specific to sugar			2
@entity267 , of the @entity268 , an industry group , also denied sugar was responsible for obesity			2
she said the industry already provided clear information on sugar levels to consumers , using figures and colour - coded labels			0
in @entity278 , the typical person consumes 12 teaspoons of sugar a day and some adults consume as many as 46			2
the film , produced by @entity282 , former wife of @entity284 creator @entity283 , is narrated by tv journalist @entity285			0
it was released this week in @entity3 .			2

new film @entity10 warns it is sugar and not fat which is causing obesity
80 per cent of the 600,000 food products in @entity3 have added sugar
a third of adults will have diabetes by 2050 if nothing is done , film predicts
dr @entity46 says it is ' one of the greatest public health epidemics of our time '
