for centuries , ships navigated the globe propelled by large sails - and one firm is hoping to return to this way of life , albeit it with a hi - tech twist			1
a @entity10 engineer has designed a radical new cargo ship with a hull so large it acts as the sails of old			1
called @entity14 , the hull on the concept would act as a so - called giant airfoil to harness power from the wind and lift and propel the ship forward , while onboard software would constantly monitor weather forecasts to choose the best course possible			1
the makers of the wind - powered hybrid merchant ship said that while engines are still needed , their design could achieve fuel savings of 60 % while reducing emissions by 80 % the makers of the wind - powered hybrid merchant ship said that while engines are still needed , their design could achieve fuel savings of 60 per cent , and reduce emissions by 80 per cent			1
the software is being developed by @entity41 's @entity40 , and the concept ship was designed by @entity43 , from @entity26			1
@entity45 's software will monitor the wind conditions and calculate the best route for the ship , by comparing real - time meteorological information to calculate wind energy			1
' with this software , you input when you want to leave and when you want to arrive , the weather forecast is loaded into the program and then it calculates the best route , ' @entity51 told @entity57			1
the relative wind is given by the ship 's course and speed , and the direction and strength of the @entity64			1
true wind is the wind measured on board a stationary ship			2
when the ship starts moving , the apparente wind is generated			0
the @entity69 of @entity14 uses this apparent wind to generate a ' positive force in the longitudinal direction of the ship ' , described as ' the angle of attack '			1
the ship can then be repositioned to take advantage of this wind propulsion			0
special software will monitor the wind conditions and calculate the best route for the ship , by comparing real - time meteorological information to calculate wind energy			1
this data will be constantly tracked and updated to make sure the ship stays on course to arrive on time			2
' this would be dynamically updated every day			0
' at each waypoint it would check with the time arrival and tell the crew whether to speed up using the engines or slow down ; it makes it very easy for the crew			2
' the relative , or apparent , wind is given by the ship 's course and speed , and the direction and strength of the true wind			2
true wind is the wind measured on board a stationary ship			0
when the ship starts moving , the apparent wind is generated			0
the @entity69 of @entity14 uses this apparent wind to generate a ' positive force in the longitudinal direction of the ship ' , described as ' the angle of attack '			1
this generates a lift , which creates propulsion , and the ship can be repositioned to take advantage of this wind propulsion			0
the ship would also use a liquefied natural gas - powered ( @entity111 ) electrical generator for the remainder of its energy , and to get it going from a standstill			2
' over time , the contribution of the ship 's @entity69 to the actual propulsion of the ship will vary ' continued the firm			2
' however , a @entity121 will balance the lng - electric propulsion system so it works with the @entity69 - keeping a constant speed of the ship			2
' this control will adjust the pitch on the propeller , as well the rotations per minute , making it possible to use fuel more efficiently			0
the design of the @entity25 has a large opening for cargo , and lifeboats that drop from a ' lip ' around the top of the boat if needed			0
the firm also said the design , which draws inspiration from the aerospace industry to create the ' symmetrical airfoil ' hull , could eventually be used for giant cruise ships			1

the captain would input when they want to arrive , and the weather forecast would be loaded to calculate the best route ' the relative wind is a crucial factor in designing aircrafts , trains , propellers and sailing boats			1
but for the design of commercial vessels , this is a revolutionary brand new way of thinking , ' explained @entity173			0
' inspired by the aerospace industry and the sailboat environment , the @entity25 is designed to utilise wind for propulsion			0
the unique element is the shape of the hull , both above and below the water line			0
' the firm has begun offering the design and technology to consultancies , ship owners and ship yards for licensing , but it is not known when a fully - functioning @entity14 will be made			1
during a journey , the route would be updated daily , and at each waypoint , the software would check arrival time			1
it would then tell the crew to speed up using the engines , or slow down			0
this gif shows how the direction could change day - by - day , and how this would theoretically affect fuel consumption the firm has begun offering the design and technology proposed for its concept ship ( pedicured ) to consultancies , ship owners and ship yards for licensing , but it is not known when a fully - functioning @entity14 will be made over time , the contribution of the @entity69 to the actual propulsion of the ship will vary , continued the firm			1
at this point , a @entity121 will balance a liquefied natural gas - powered ( @entity111 ) propulsion system that works with the @entity69 to keep a constant speed of the ship			2
this control will adjust the pitch on the propeller , as well the rotations per minute , so it uses fuel more efficiently ( pictured ) in august 2013 , the world 's largest solar boat - the @entity223 - docked in @entity224 as part of its epic scientific discovery along the @entity228			0
the eco-friendly boat 's crew of nine was collecting data on the sea and atmosphere between the @entity234 and @entity10 as part of an investigation into climate change			0
the impressive vessel crossed the @entity239 in a record breaking 22 days in 2013			0

the catamaran , which is a scientific research platform for the @entity247 ( @entity247 ) , has a top speed of 14 knots and has 809 solar panels that can generate up to 480 kwh on a sunny day			0
the @entity14 was inspired by merchant sailing ships ( stock image of the clipper @entity254 ) as well as airfoils used in the aerospace industry to lift aircraft and travel forward , using wind power and built - in engines			1

a @entity10 firm designed the concept , which could achieve fuel savings of 60 % while reducing emissions by 80 %
the @entity14 , by @entity26 , uses a hull that acts as a so - called giant airfoil to harness the wind and propel the ship
onboard software will monitor the wind conditions and calculate the best route for the ship
it will do this by comparing real - time meteorological information to the angle of the ship to calculate wind energy
captains could input an arrival time and the weather forecast will be loaded to calculate the *optimum* route
as the journey *progresses* , the *computer* will update the course and speed needed to arrive on time
firm said the design could eventually be used for giant cruise ships , but a *completion* date has not been *announced*
