by @entity0 , political correspondent published : 07:48 est , 11 december 2012 updated : 09:56 est , 12 december 2012 gay marriage will be legal in some @entity3 churches by 2014 , despite furious @entity5 warnings that the issue could split the party and cost it the next election			1
in a surprise move , the @entity9 will be guaranteed a blanket exemption from holding same - sex marriages			1
but this failed to quell a major @entity5 backlash			1
amid stormy scenes in the @entity17 , equalities minister @entity15 vowed to fast - track plans to legalise gay marriage , saying the change was needed to keep the institution of marriage ‘ vibrant and relevant to society ’			1
scroll down for @entity15 's statement to the @entity25 ... culture secretary @entity15 promised a ' quadruple legal lock ' to prevent the @entity9 from being forced to hold gay weddings she confirmed a government u-turn on the issue which will allow religious institutions , such as the @entity31 , that want to conduct gay marriages to ‘ opt in ’ to the law and hold ceremonies in their churches			1
but unexpectedly , she announced there would be a specific legal ban on the @entity9 and @entity39 holding gay weddings			1
mrs @entity15 said this would give the @entity9 ‘ iron - clad ’ protection against legal action by gay rights campaigners			1
other religious institutions , such as the @entity46 , will also be allowed to refuse to hold ceremonies for same - sex couples , as will individual vicars			0
mrs @entity15 said the legislation would include a ‘ quadruple lock ’ , meaning no church will ever be forced to conduct a gay wedding unless it wants to			1
the legal protections include : - a guarantee that no religious organisation or individual minister can be compelled to marry same - sex couples or to permit this to happen on their premises			2
- a legal bar on allowing ministers to marry same - sex couples unless their organisation ’s governing body has expressly opted in to provisions for doing so			0
- amendment of the @entity69 to ensure no discrimination claim can be brought against religious organisations or individual ministers for refusing to marry a same - sex couple			0
- an explicit statement that it will be illegal for the @entity9 and the @entity39 to marry same - sex couples and that @entity76 , which bans same - sex weddings , will continue to apply			2
in the @entity17 , gay former justice minister @entity78 said same - sex marriage was backed by the public , but he was heckled by @entity5 mp @entity81 who insisted it is not legislation will be published next month			1
ministers expect it to take up to 12 months to get through @entity86 , with the first gay marriage ceremonies taking place in early 2014			0
but furious @entity89 warned the legislation would undermine the institution of marriage and cost the party votes			2
@entity94 , ministerial aide to the work and pensions secretary @entity96 , warned mrs @entity15 that the proposal was ‘ directly contrary to what @entity98 said about marriage ’			2
former defence minister @entity100 said ministers had ‘ no right whatsoever ’ to alter the definition of marriage as being the union of one man and one woman			0
fellow @entity107 said the government ’s consultation process , which brushed aside a petition opposing the move signed by 600,000 people , was a ‘ constitutional outrage ’ and ‘ reminiscent of a @entity115 presidential election ’			0
in an open letter to @entity118 last night , senior @entity5 mp @entity116 warned the issue could split the party and cost the @entity5 the next election			2
mr @entity116 said the issue was driving supporters away , adding : ‘ i am perturbed that our chances of winning the next election are compromised by the pursuit of issues which serve to divide the party , and detach the leadership from its support base in the country			0
’ @entity130 leader of the @entity3 @entity132 , said the issue would be at the heart of his election campaign			2
' @entity118 's proposal has the potential to rip apart the traditional rural @entity5 vote			1
while @entity132 wholly respects the rights of gay people to have civil partnerships , we feel the prime minister 's proposals will present an affront to millions of people in this country for whom this will be the final straw , ' he told @entity150			1
' the division between city and rural is absolutely huge			0
in my village pub in @entity156 they are just completely against			0
' free vote : labour leader @entity158 has granted @entity159 a free vote on the issue all @entity5 mps , including ministers , are to be given a free vote on what mrs @entity15 described as an ‘ issue of conscience ’			1
privately ministers believe at least 40 per cent of @entity5 mps oppose the legislation			1
in another surprise move , @entity159 said it would give its mps a free vote			1
only @entity175 mps will be whipped to support gay marriage			1
but @entity159 condemned the decision to put a legal block on the @entity9			1
shadow home secretary @entity179 said : ‘ why is the government now rowing backwards on equal marriage ? having said churches would be able to hold same - sex marriages if they wanted to , they now say it will be illegal for the @entity9 to do so even if it wants to in future			1
how can that be freedom of religion ? ’ speaking on behalf of the @entity9 in the @entity25 , the @entity187 @entity186 said : ‘ marriage is not the property of the government nor is it the property of the @entity9			2
while the forms and legalities around marriage have evolved over time , one fundamental feature has remained the same throughout – that marriage is a union of one man and one woman			0
’ archbishop @entity196 , the leader of the @entity198 , and archbishop @entity199 , the archbishop of @entity200 , voiced their opposition in a joint statement			0
‘ the meaning of marriage matters , ’ they said			0
‘ it derives that meaning from its function as the foundation of the family			0
the union of one man and one woman for love and mutual support and open to procreation has over the centuries formed a stable unit we call the family			0
’ opponents condemned the government ’s consultation on the issue and warned that ministers could face a @entity228 review			0
and veteran human rights campaigner @entity229 denounced the exemption for the @entity9 and the @entity39 as ‘ disappointing ’ , saying it could be open to legal challenge			2
he said : ‘ exempting the official established @entity9 sends the wrong signal			0
there is no reason why these churches should be treated differently from other faiths			0
discriminating between faith groups is probably illegal under the @entity239			0
