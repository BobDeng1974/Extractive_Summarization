@entity1 manager @entity0 has expressed sympathy for under - pressure @entity4 boss @entity3 , but is ready to turn the screw again			1
@entity3 has faced vehement protests from @entity8 fans calling for him to be sacked following the club 's wretched start to the season as they are currently bottom of the @entity13 with no wins and just three points from five games			1
at one point during saturday 's home clash with @entity20 , the exit door was staring @entity3 in the face as his side trailed 2 - 0 with 17 minutes remaining			2
@entity0 has sympathises with @entity4 boss @entity3 , but is ready to turn the screw @entity3 has come under increasing pressure as manager at @entity28 this season @entity4 hit back , though , to force a draw before following up with an extra-time victory in the @entity31 at @entity32 on wednesday to ease some of the strain on @entity3			1
despite understanding his opposite number 's plight , @entity0 is ready to add to @entity3 's pain going into the league clash between the teams at the @entity39 on monday			1
' it 's a difficult business we 're in and you do n't like to see a fellow manager under pressure like that , ' said @entity0			2
' but @entity3 's a very experienced @entity13 manager			1
he 's been there a long time in charge of a big club with big demands and big expectations			0
' i seem to recall he 's been through similar periods before and he 's come out the other side , so it shows he has the capacity and ability to turn the situation around			0
' they 've started doing that by coming back from a difficult situation in the league , and then they had a great result in midweek , so their confidence is probably higher than it was two games ago			0
some supporters have protested against @entity3 and the ownership of @entity67 recently ' from our point of view it 's a bit of a shame they will have had that turn in confidence with those two performances			1
' we will have to be mindful of that , but we just want to take care of our own business			0
' if that adds to the pressure @entity3 seems to be under he understands that 's what we have to do			2
' @entity0 senses whilst the fans may be against @entity3 , his players at least are with him			2
' it seems he 's shaping the team and there have been a lot of changes which he 's had to deal with , ' added @entity0			0
' but his team has shown a lot of character in these last couple of games , they seem to be playing for him , and as a manager you want to see your players still doing that			0
' there 's no reason why they should n't be doing that because he 's a good , experienced manager at this level			0
