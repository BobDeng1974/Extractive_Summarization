by @entity0 published : 10:45 est , 25 february 2014 @entity2 : 12:07 est , 25 february 2014 clutching my tiny two week old son to my somewhat frazzled body i let my mother into a secret			1
‘ to be honest , he has n't left the house yet , ’ i whispered , revealing that two week old @entity8 was as cosseted as a young prince			0
not only was i exhausted , but i was terrified of venturing outside in case we forgot some vital piece of equipment			0
what if i found myself in an embarrassing explosive nappy changing emergency ? what if he got hungry and i had nowhere and nothing to feed him ? the reality , to put this into perspective , was that we lived in @entity28 , never further than 100 metres from a supermarket and i was breast feeding so frankly , all would be fine			0
plus we had a top of the range @entity32 pushchair for for safe and easy travel			0
any crisis could be resolved by leaping into a black cab and hot - footing it back to @entity47			0
but no modern day high tech equipment would have ever made me want to hit the beach two weeks post birth			1
i ca n't think of anything worse			0
i could barely get ready for bed , never mind anything else			0
mum of three @entity0 says she can imagine nothing worse than going on a beach holiday two weeks after giving birth so , as you can imagine , i was astonished to see young @entity60 ’s launch into society taking place on a balmy beach just ten days after his birth			1
i would rather have travelled on the first manned flight to @entity66 than take a newborn to a sand - infested boiling hot beach			1
let me tell you about tiny babies and beaches			0
firstly - and i realise that this is obvious , but it appears that @entity38 ’s parents may have forgotten - beaches are full of that irritating stuff known as sand			1
get that into a nappy and you are potentially looking at nappy rash and therefore an unhappy and wide - awake baby who requires a nappy change			2
it goes without saying that changing a nappy on a beach is inevitably going to involve , yes you guessed it , more sand			2
we all know it gets everyhwhere so you can forget any thoughts of cleaning that baby 's bum properly because wipes are sand magnets			1
the slightest breeze - and by this i mean the sort of breeze that might lightly flutter the hem of @entity37 ’s kaftan - will have sand sticking to the baby wipe , and thus to the bottom of young @entity36			1
@entity0 points out the huge impracticality of having to carry at least ten sterilised bottles to the beach @entity0 says that most normal mothers would n't be able to carry all the equipment needed for the beach next , there is the kit			1
breast feeding or not , new babies need approximately twelve suitcases of baggage - nappies changes of clothes , toys ( no new parent , myself included , has even acknowledged that the two day old is not going to appreciate teddy bears , even if they come from @entity122 )			0
so it is n’t surprising that @entity36 and @entity37 need what looks like five or six nannies			1
' it goes without saying that changing a nappy on a beach is inevitably going to involve some sort of sand / baby wipe interaction			1
baby wipes have their uses , but they also act as sand magnets ' as @entity37 appears not to be breast - feeding , she will need about ten sterilised bottles			1
and should one touch anything a bit dirty ( e.g. a dog 's tongue ! ) it will be totally redundant			2
finally , but most importantly , there is the @entity144 sun , which is presumably both hot and powerful			2
although the newborn has mostly been photographed under an assortment of white billowing tents , it seems extraordinary that they would n’t just keep him inside and away from any risk of over-heating or sunstroke			2
@entity37 avoids giving her baby dreaded sunstroke by sheltering in a large white tent we did n’t take baby @entity8 to a beach until he was eight months old			1
i remember the special sun - tent , the twenty sorts of hypo - allergenic sun cream , the baby food spilling in the bottom of the @entity165 rucksack and the hissed and irritable mewling which accompanies all normal babies in transit			1
i ca n't help thinking , looking at all the photos that @entity37 is n't always enjoying herself at the beach with her baby			1
she looks - as a friend of mine has pointed out - a bit cross			0
i think this might be like calling @entity36 a ‘ bit rich			0
’ in a couple of the pictures her lips look pursed as though she wants to tell someone to just leave her alone			0
@entity36 was seen with an entourage of young female fans on baby @entity38 's first outing to the beach @entity0 says that most new mothers do n't want to be seen in public for a while after birth - especially if their partners are surrounded by young female fans eager to flirt most new mothers do n’t want to be seen in public for at least a week			1
frankly , i think she must have the patience of a saint to be trekking on hot sand clutching a days old baby in on - trend beachwear			2
one is at this point - to be delicate about the situation - recovering physically from the trauma of giving birth			1
so a short kaftan is beyond impractical			2
generally , even if you have maintained your pre-pregnancy figure as amazingly as @entity37 , you feel a bit fat			1
a baby has just emerged from your tummy and it inevitably takes at least a few weeks to lose the extra pounds			2
@entity206 says that recently giving birth and a short kaftan do n't go hand in hand so the last thing you want is to be seen half - naked ( by everybody in the developed world ) , especially as your partner is being heavily flirted with by any number of toned hotties with good plastic surgery and small bikinis			1
most women during that first week get a bit weepy as the body undergoes extreme hormonal changes			0
again - taking the infant onto a beach with fifty staff and close friends is the last thing you feel like doing			2
you want to be slumped in a chair with day - time telly , comfy pyjamas and your husband and relatives dancing close attendance			0
( this is what i did with every one of my three babies )			0
most mothers might burst into tears , shove the baby at @entity36 screaming , ‘ he ’s your responsibility too , ’ and storm off back to the five star hotel			0
and most fathers would probably take it on the chin			0
i watch with interest …			0

*writer* @entity0 was *shocked* to see @entity37 and baby @entity38 on the beach
lists the impracticalities that come with a newborn and a beach visit
says @entity37 's kaftan is a brave *choice* when recovering post birth
believes most mums would balk at the idea of a sun holiday so soon
