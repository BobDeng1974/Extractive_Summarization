every time i walk in the front door i think am i going to get a knife in my back ? '			2
@entity49 had been at the pub with friends on the night of his murder on april 24 , last year the mother - of - one was woken by a team of police knocking on her door at 12.30am on april 24 , last year			1
' at first , i thought it was @entity8 and that maybe he 'd forgotten his keys , ' she said			2
' i saw torches shining outside and realised it was n't him			2
' ' i threw the door open and obviously it was the police			2
i asked if he 'd been mugged , or arrested for being drunk , but even that did n't make sense because he was n't like that			0
' he was so friendly and sociable			0
he was n't the type to get into drunken arguments			0
' they told me they could n't say anything until a detective got there , and that 's when i knew he 'd been murdered			0
' i was a rabbit in the headlights			0
it is almost like you shut down and go through the motions			0
' after the attack she fled to a family member 's home , while officers took @entity11 into custody to question him where he admitted to a similar unprovoked attack just weeks earlier , on april 6			1
armed with a knife , he had launched himself at a teenage boy , stabbing him with such ferocity that the blade went straight through the base of his neck			0
miraculously , the boy survived , but a chilling x-ray shows that the knife just missed his spinal column			0
a post-mortem examination on april 25 counted more than 200 stab wounds on mr @entity49 's body and it was noted that there were no defensive wounds to his arms or hands			1
' that first blow would have taken @entity8 down to his knees , ' mrs @entity9 said			2
