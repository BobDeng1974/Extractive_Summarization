@entity2 , in a land far , far away , a cross-dressing artist had a magical idea to build a fairytale house			2
it would look just like somewhere @entity6 would like to live ( provided they wanted to live in @entity7 ) and of course , it would have an enchanting tale behind it			1
three years ago it was simply a dream for @entity15 prizewinner @entity14			1
today his vision – nicknamed the @entity17 by disgruntled locals in the rural , riverside village where he ’s plonked it – is a reality nearing completion			1
some of the locals have declared it ‘ a practical joke ’ and say it will ruin the landscape			1
but here ’s a twist in the tale			2
despite some continuing misgivings and the initial horror of some residents when the plans were announced , there is a growing feeling that everyone might yet live happily ever after alongside the artist ’s green and gold creation			1
one told the @entity64 : ‘ i love it ! ’ @entity65 , 65 , added : ‘ i find it really uplifting			0
it ’s a beautiful spot , and it needed something like this			0
’ the house is located on the banks of the @entity73 , near the rural village of @entity43 the home 's green and white ceramic tiles , which feature safety pins , can be seen for miles @entity14 admits that he first came up with the design whilst ' doodling wildly and quite drunkenly in front of the tv ' @entity14 admitted he had originally designed the house whilst ‘ doodling wildly and quite drunkenly in front of the television ’			1
he wanted it to resemble a ‘ jewel box ’ that told the story of a mythical @entity7 woman called @entity31 , who had a difficult childhood , love life , divorce and late career			1
hence , there ’s an 8ft statue of her on the roof , naked and pregnant , and her name is emblazoned all over the walls			0
the nappy pins and hearts may be a tribute to her mothering skills ; the three knives on shields are the @entity7 coat of arms ; and the cassette tapes are assumed to be elements of her story			2
outside , 2,000 hand - made tiles provide the colour			2
inside , tapestries and mosaics have been designed to illustrate @entity31 ’s life			0
before : a pebble - stone farmhouse initially stood on the land			2
however , some residents are still unhappy that the more traditional structure was torn down local residents in favour of @entity14 's creation hope that it will bring tourists to the area the @entity15 - winning , cross-dressing artist is known primarily for his work with ceramics the project was funded by @entity130 , which engages world class architects to create unique homes for rent			1
@entity14 told locals at a village hall presentation the house would effectively be a shrine to @entity31 , a conceptual , everyday woman from the county in which he was born			1
later he revealed he had taken inspiration ‘ from single mums in @entity141 and hairdressers in @entity143 ’			0
the house , he said , would ‘ relate to buildings put up as memories to loved ones , to follies , to eccentric home - built structures , to shrines , lighthouses and fairy tales ’			2
except that some objectors told planners the proposed building was a ‘ monstrosity ’			0
although the parish council denied the plans for the re-build , a second application was eventually approved @entity14 has said that he hopes and believes that the cottage ' will add greatly to the cultural standing of the area ' despite this , @entity164 granted permission for the 54 - year - old married father - of - one to create his dream			1
@entity169 , who lives on the lane to the house , described it as ‘ very interesting but in the wrong place ’			0
she added : ‘ it has totally ruined the natural scenery			0
’ @entity176 , however , disagreed			0
‘ we are quite privileged to live next door to it			0
i suspect the number of visitors will be annoying though			0
’ picking up on that theme , another resident said : ‘ people will come and visit from @entity184 and have a very amusing tale to tell at dinner parties			0
' but they wo n’t have to look at it day in and day out and wonder if they are victims of a practical joke			1
