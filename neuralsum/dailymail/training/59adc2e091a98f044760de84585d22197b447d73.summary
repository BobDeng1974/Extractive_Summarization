convicted : @entity0 was convicted of the january , 1999 , murder of his ex-girlfriend , @entity2 a 15 - year - old murder case that landed a popular teenager from @entity5 behind bars for life is being revived in a podcast that offers more questions than answers about the crime and its fallout			1
ultimately , a @entity14 appeals court will decide the man 's fate - ending years of speculation as to where @entity0 was for an hour after school on january 13 , 1999			1
millions of listeners are anxiously awaiting the next installment of @entity20 , a podcast from the creators of ' @entity23 ' that tells the story of @entity0 , a @entity25 student who was found guilty in 2000 of murdering his ex-girlfriend @entity26			1
the podcast is the brainchild of longtime radio producer and former @entity31 reporter @entity30 , who spent more than a year digging into @entity0 's case and reporting her findings in almost real - time in hour - long segments released online every thursday ( with the exception of @entity36 )			1
nine episodes in , the podcast has attracted more than 1.5 million listeners per episode worldwide and turned @entity0 into something of a household name , inspiring a dedicated fan base , re-cap blogs and even spin - off podcasts , not to mention heated debates around countless water coolers and dinner tables about @entity0 's guilt or innocence			1
but although the buzz surrounding the case is new , @entity0 has been trying to prove his innocence for years - so long , in fact , that his case is now in its final stages of appeal			2
a hearing scheduled for january represents what @entity0 's lawyer , @entity60 @entity59 , said is the man 's ' last best chance ' at freedom			1
missing hour : @entity0 claims to have an alibi for his whereabouts on january 13 - although he says he can not remember exactly where he was at the time of @entity2 's death - but he has always denied killing her ' i joke that when i was hired to do @entity0 's appeal i was a free - wheeling single man and now i 'm married with two kids			1
it 's been a lengthy process , ' said @entity59 , who has represented @entity0 for more than five years			2
' there are three parts to the legal process : a trial , then an appeal , then you have post-conviction relief			0
this is the last step			0
' @entity0 , now 34 , was convicted of first - degree murder , robbery and false imprisonment in 2000 and sentenced to life in prison			1
prosecutors said @entity0 strangled @entity2 after becoming inconsolably jealous when the two broke up and she began dating someone else			2
the primary points @entity59 makes in his appeal are some of the same reasons @entity30 told listeners in her podcast 's first episode that she decided to investigate the case : there were no eye - witnesses tying @entity0 to the crime , and @entity0 's attorney , @entity102 , failed to interview a witness who said she was with @entity0 at the time @entity2 was killed			1
@entity102 , a high - profile @entity5 - area criminal defense attorney , was disbarred in 2001 when client funds went missing			0
she died in 2004 of a heart attack			0
the podcast is the brainchild of longtime radio producer and former @entity31 reporter @entity30 , who spent more than a year digging into @entity0 's case and reporting her findings in almost real - time in hour - long segments released online every thursday @entity59 in his appeal says @entity102 knew about @entity113 , a classmate of @entity0 's who saw him in the library around the time prosecutors say @entity2 was killed			1
but @entity59 says the attorney failed to pursue her alibi during trial			0
' the entire trial depended on whether @entity0 could prove where he was at the time of the murder , ' @entity59 wrote			0
' meanwhile , a credible witness - an honors student who had no obvious bias in favor of @entity0 - had come forward unsolicited with a recollection that she had been with @entity0 around the time of the murder ... yet the lawyer did absolutely nothing			2
' @entity59 also wrote that @entity102 erred when she did not seek a plea deal for @entity0 , who asked her several times whether a plea option was available			0
the @entity131 asked prosecutors to respond to the post-conviction appeal in september to see if they too believed @entity0 had ineffective counsel in a move @entity59 said is highly unusual			2
ultimately , as millions of listeners try and parse the evidence for themselves , what happens next is up to the judges			0
' it 's an unusual phenomenon , ' @entity59 said			0
' @entity141 has shown some interest in the case and asked the state to respond to our application , which is more than they usually do in this procedural posture			0
but i truly think the appellate courts make their decisions based on the merits of the case , and not the popularity of a podcast			0
