by @entity0 recovery : @entity3 's faith forbids transfusions @entity6 scientists have created a groundbreaking machine that recycles blood lost in operations			1
the invention will allow @entity11 to have major surgery because it rules out the need for blood transfusions , which their faith forbids			1
the technology could also save the @entity17 millions by reducing the demand for donated blood			1
the @entity21 filtering machine was used recently on jehovah ’s witness @entity3 , 50			1
doctors told the freelance translator she needed to have part of her aorta – the largest blood vessel in the body – replaced because it could burst at any time , killing her			2
she suffers from a rare inherited condition called @entity32 , which makes her cartilage highly stretchy , meaning the walls of the top of her aorta were dangerously thin			0
but she said she would agree to surgery only if she could have the operation without a transfusion			2
jehovah ’s witnesses believe it is against @entity43 ’s will to ‘ ingest blood ’ in any way			2
the team at the @entity47 in @entity48 then mentioned the @entity21 machine			2
unlike other blood recovery devices , it enables the collection not only of red blood cells but also of crucial cells and enzymes that help it to clot , meaning mrs @entity3 could have the operation without receiving any blood products			2
she underwent the seven - hour operation in late january and is now recovering well after spending just 13 days in hospital			0
last night she said : ‘ people tell me they ca n’t believe i ’ve recently had heart surgery			0
at last i can breathe properly again			0
’ during the operation @entity64 lost more than two pints of blood			1
but this was pumped straight back into her body			0
the machine works by filtering blood through a plastic membrane that captures vital red blood cells , clotting cells called platelets and enzymes called clotting factors			1
@entity77 , who operated the machine , explained : ‘ we had to have everything connected in one continuous loop , so at no point would the blood have left her body ’s circulation			1
we went to great lengths to make sure the loop was not broken			0
’ discovery : the machine rules out the need for blood transfusions and could save the @entity17 millions by reducing the demand for donated blood he added : ‘ this was a life - saving operation because the danger was that her aorta could have ruptured at any time			1
that would have been catastrophic			0
’ but it would have been nearly impossible to save her life after a rupture without resorting to a blood transfusion , he added			1
the machine was the brainchild of @entity108 , professor of biomedical engineering at @entity110 in @entity111			0
he took his idea to @entity113 , a @entity115 - based firm , which makes wound dressings and other high - tech medical products			0
founder @entity118 said : ‘ it shows what is possible with a bit of @entity6 ingenuity			0
’ he has calculated the device could save the @entity17 more than £ 10 million a year by reducing the demand for donated blood .			1

scientist created machine that recycles blood lost in operations
will allow @entity11 to have major surgery as rules out need for blood transfusions which their faith forbids
*gadget* could save @entity17 millions by reducing demand for donated blood
