sea captains have reported ‘ funeral processions ’ and grieving behaviour in bottlenosed dolphins and now a new study suggests that @entity5 spotted dolphins also mourn the death of their offspring			1

a new study suggests that @entity5 spotted dolphins ( stock image ) mourn the death of offspring			2
scientists reported four adult dolphins ‘ displaying nurturant behaviour ’ by supporting a dead calf in the waters off @entity14 , as well as another instance of the behaviour a group of researchers from the @entity26 , @entity27 , studied two instances of nurturing and seemingly sympathetic behaviour			1
the first was noted by the operator of a tourist boat and recorded four adult dolphins supporting the body of a dead calf using their backs and heads , which continued for half an hour before the group moved on , @entity31 reported			1
the second was seen by staff on a research vessel			0
they said that one dolphin , thought to be a mother , was supporting a dead calf on the water ’s surface			2
‘ the in situ observations show that adult @entity5 spotted dolphins try to support their dead calves at surface , either involving a single individual ( presumably the mother ) or several individuals , ’ the researchers wrote in the study , published in @entity53			1

a stock image of an @entity5 spotted dolphin is shown the first instance of nurturing behaviour was noted by the operator of a tourist boat and recorded adult dolphins supporting the body of a dead calf using their backs and heads , which continued for half an hour before the group moved on			1

they said that one dolphin , thought to be a mother , was supporting a dead calf on the water ’s surface			0
post mortem examinations were carried out on the dolphin carcasses described in the study , as well as two other dead calves , which were found floating alone nearby			0
they revealed that the four calves died from natural causes and not from predation or violent pod behaviour			0
‘ the highly fresh condition of the carcasses suggests that the adults abandon them after a short period of time ( hours ) , ’ according to the study			2
@entity101 , who led the study , said there are records of other dolphin species carrying the carcasses of their young for days , but @entity5 spotted dolphins seem to mourn their young quickly , long before they start to decompose			1
bottlenosed dolphins , sea otters , harbour seals , apes and elephants are among the animals believed to grieve for dead family members			0
although this is difficult to prove , dr @entity101 thinks that @entity5 spotted dolphins join the emotionally intelligent group			1
he said he believes that animals such as elephants and pilot wales that spend a lifetime together – sometimes over 60 years – ‘ can grieve ’			0

here , a two - year - old calf called @entity126 grieves his dead mother in spring 2013 , the captain of a tourist boat encountered a dolphin carrying her dead calf using her dorsal fin , through the water			0
@entity134 , who saw the sad event off the coast of @entity137 , @entity138 , said he had never seen anything like it in his 20 years at sea			0
in spring 2013 , the captain of tourist boat encountered a dolphin carrying her dead calf using her dorsal fin ( pictured ) , through water off the coast of @entity137 , @entity138 ' nor have i ever seen anything quite as moving as this mother who refuses to let go of her poor calf , ' he wrote on his @entity150 channel			2
' did mom start off helping her weak , sick offspring swim to the surface to breathe for days till the tiny dolphin died ? ' when will she give up on her calf ? will she continue carrying her deceased on her back until the carcass begins to disintegrate ? ' the sad behaviour has been seen before in bottlenosed dolphins , a few of which have been recorded carrying dead calves even after they started to decompose .			2

scientists from the @entity26 , @entity27 , reported adult @entity5 spotted dolphins off the coast of @entity14 displaying nurturing behaviour
they supported a dead calf with their heads and backs , before moving on
*post-mortem* examinations found adults likely abandon bodies after a short period of time , *unlike* some other species that carry dead young for days
while it *'s* hard to prove , the lead researcher thinks the dolphins grieve
