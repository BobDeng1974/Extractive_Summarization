by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 14:31 est , 26 february 2014 @entity4 : 17:41 est , 26 february 2014 less than one in 10 female soldiers want a combat job , a survey of the 170,000 women serving in the @entity7 has revealed - and for those who want to serve in battle , the vast majority agree that physical standards must not be lowered to accommodate women			1
with roughly one in five @entity7 positions considered combat - related , commanders are turning to science to find a unisex standard to judge which soldiers physically have the right stuff to fight wars			1
testing at @entity21 and other @entity23 bases is breaking away from the @entity7 's longtime standards for physical fitness — pushups , sit - ups and two - mile runs — to focus instead on battlefield tasks , such as dragging a wounded comrade to safety or installing and removing the heavy barrel of the 25 mm gun mounted on @entity35 vehicles			1
heavy lifting : @entity7 corporal @entity37 carries a 65 - pound @entity39 missile several yards before loading it into a launcher on a @entity35 fighting vehicle only eight per cent of army women who responded to the survey said they wanted to fight on the battlefield			1
of those , an overwhelming number said they 'd like to be a @entity49 – a member of the elite special operations helicopter crews who perhaps are best known for flying the @entity53 into @entity55 ’s compound in 2011			0
last year , the @entity56 ordered that women must have the same opportunities to serve in combat jobs as men , with thousands of positions slated to open to both genders in 2016			1
researchers also found that soldiers of both genders are nervous about women entering combat jobs , but say they are determined to do it fairly			1
the study showed men are worried about losing their jobs to women and women are worried they will be seen as getting jobs because of their gender and not their qualifications			1
@entity7 pfc @entity77 carries a 103lb barrel to a @entity35 during a physical demands study @entity7 pfc @entity77 dresses in her @entity83 battle gear spc @entity84 , left , puts on her hydration pack in preparation for her role as a volunteer in a physical demands study @entity91 , deputy chief of staff for operations at the @entity7 's @entity93 at @entity94 in @entity95 , said some people think the @entity7 is coming up with unrealistic requirements while others believe standards will be lower to let women fight on the front lines			1
' we intend to do neither			0
that 's why we based this on the actual thing you have to do , ' he said			0
at @entity21 in @entity108 , a volunteer group of soldiers - 100 men and 60 women - are spending a month drilling on the most physically challenging tasks demanded of infantrymen , cavalry scouts , mortar launchers and tank crews			1
in march , scientists from the @entity7 's @entity120 will have the troops perform those tasks while wearing heart rate monitors , masks that monitor oxygen intake and other equipment to study the effects of their physical exertion			1
one of the volunteers , @entity131 , said she has no intention of trading in her job as an @entity7 cook to join an infantry platoon or an armor unit			2
but she sees the testing as a great opportunity to lead the way for women in the @entity23 military			2
' the heaviest thing we lift in the kitchen is boxes of frozen chicken , 45 pounds , ' said @entity147 , 29 , of @entity148 , @entity149			0
' and you do n't have to lift those over your head			0
' @entity7 spc @entity153 hoists a 44lb section of a 50 caliber machine gun onto a @entity158 tank a group of three female soldiers along with male soldiers watch a male soldier lift a 44lb section of a 50 caliber machine gun onto a @entity166 tank @entity7 pfc @entity77 lifts a 65lb @entity39 missile through a hatch into the launcher of a @entity35 during a training session tuesday , @entity147 shaved 45 seconds off her previous best time carrying two anti-tank missiles into a @entity35 armored vehicle and loading them into the turret			1
@entity7 commanders say there are no doubts that women have the mental and technical abilities needed			2
only their ability to perform the most arduous physical tasks has been questioned			2
the survey released yesterday found there were nagging stereotypes			0
male soldiers fretted that their unit 's readiness will be degraded because of what they term ' women issues , ' such as pregnancy and menstrual cycles			2
or they worried that women incapable of the physical demands would be brought in anyway			2

@entity91 said such limited interest also is in line with what other countries , such as @entity211 , have seen as they integrated women into combat roles			2
major general @entity215 , commanding general at @entity21 , watched tuesday as coed groups of soldiers set up heavy 120mm mortars on a practice field			0
an officer with 32 years of infantry experience , @entity215 said it 's time to open combat jobs to women and ' this is going to get studied to death ' in order for the @entity7 to prove to naysayers that women soldiers are physically capable			1
the volunteer group at @entity21 includes a mix of combat veterans and newcomers , but it did n't take long for the group to gel after some initial awkwardness			2
' it was almost like a high school dance where you had the guys over here and the girls over there , ' @entity215 said			0
' a week later , it was amazing how fast teams form			0
' army chief of staff general @entity245 speaks at the @entity56 giving soldiers a month to prepare meant women who have never been trained to scale a six - foot wall or pull a casualty from a tank have had time to learn the proper techniques before they are tested for real next month			0
staff sergeant @entity253 , a cavalry scout who has helping train the @entity21 volunteers , said female soldiers started to catch up with their male counterparts after two weeks of training			0
missile toting drills that initially took the men seven minutes were taking women 12 minutes to complete , he said			0
but by week three , men and women had trimmed their times to about four minutes			0
those who still insist women ca n't perform as well as men in combat ' can beat their chests about it all day , ' said @entity253 , a veteran of @entity270 and @entity271			1
' but eventually it 's going to happen			0
' exactly what sort of fitness tests or standards will come out of the @entity7 's study remains to be seen			1
there are no current fitness requirements for serving in combat positions beyond the @entity7 's standard physical fitness test for all soldiers — which includes pushups , situps and a 2 - mile run and grades men and women on different scales			1
@entity91 said the @entity7 took a lesson from fire departments by not focusing on soldier 's ability to perform pushups or pullups , which favor men because they test upper body strength			1
he said officials realize women do physical tasks differently , using more core strength and legs			2
by focusing on tasks rather than exercises , @entity7 officials hope to eliminate gender bias from their study			1
taking a break from toting anti-tank missiles at @entity21 , @entity84 said she found the heavy lifting to be humbling			0
and though she felt encouraged by her male colleagues , she had no desire to give up driving a truck and join a combat unit			0
' it 's not that i came , i saw and conquered , ' she said			0
' but i came , i saw and i did my best			0

only eight *percent* of women in the armed forces want combat jobs
both men and women are *emphatic* that the military ca n't lower standards of physical requirements to accommodate women
the @entity7 is *abandoning* *traditional* physical fitness tests like pushups
now they test battlefield tasks like dragging a wounded comrade to safety
soldiers of both genders are nervous about women in combat jobs
women fear being seen as getting jobs because of their gender
