@entity1 ’s leadership of @entity3 ’s one - day team was looking increasingly hard to justify after his latest batting failure paved the way for yet another series defeat			1
the sixth game against @entity8 had been billed as a resurgent @entity3 ’s chance to set up the pleasant surprise of a decider in @entity12 on tuesday			2
instead , @entity1 fell to the third ball of their run chase , leg - before for a single to the off - spin of @entity18 , then watched as his team - mates slumped to 202 all out and a crushing 90 - run loss			1
@entity21 fell to a first - ball duck as @entity3 lost against @entity8 in the sixth one - day international @entity1 had yet another day to forget as @entity3 captain as they lost the @entity26 series @entity3 now trail @entity8 4 - 2 , and have lost five of their last six bilateral series			1
@entity1 ’s average out here is 17			2
earlier , the @entity3 captain put down the simplest of catches at mid-off to reprieve @entity34 on 41			1
@entity34 is not a man given to spurning second chances : already in red - hot form , he went on to a match - winning , run - a - ball 112 , his 20th one - day century			1
this was not a good day for the credibility of @entity42 cricket			0
and it strained further when @entity1 spoke of his determination to stay in the job			2
‘ it ’s tough , ’ he said			0
‘ i ’m not scoring the runs i ’d like			0
it ’s not a great place to be as a captain			0
@entity1 made just one as @entity3 lost an early wicket in pursuit of 293 in @entity54 @entity34 scored a stunning century on saturday as @entity8 wrapped up the series @entity56 was again one of the only men to stand up and be counted , scoring another fifty ‘ i ’m a better player than i ’m showing at the moment , and i ’ve just got to keep going			1
i ’m hitting the ball quite nicely in the nets			0
’ asked whether he would still lead @entity3 at the @entity61 , he answered simply : ‘ yes			2
’ but there was a more equivocal response from coach @entity64			0
asked on @entity65 to confirm @entity1 would indeed lead his side out against @entity67 at @entity68 on february 14 , @entity64 said : ‘ as with everything we will sit down and review it at the end of the series			2
’ it was not a ringing endorsement			0
@entity1 has now scored 87 runs in five innings in this series at a strike - rate — 67 — that belongs to an era when one - day openers still regarded their job as taking the shine off the new ball			1
@entity56 was eventually bowled by @entity84 as @entity3 's chances of victory dissipated quickly it had looked good for @entity3 at one stage as @entity89 celebrates the wicket of @entity91 now , one - dayers are viewed by almost every team as elongated games of @entity95 have been 44 sixes in this series by 16 different batsmen ; @entity1 is not among them			1
the counter-argument is that he is not supposed to be a rope - clearer , but an accumulator who allows the strokemakers to bat around him			0
the counter-argument has fallen flat , too			0
@entity3 ’s reply had its moments			0
@entity108 carved 34 off 32 balls and @entity56 made an enterprising 55			1
@entity110 ’s 45 - ball 41 underlined his all - round credentials			1
but @entity113 suffered his first failure since returning to @entity3 colours , @entity112 wasted another opportunity after pleading for a promotion to no 5 , and @entity21 fell first ball			1
@entity3 had been profligate with the ball too			1
after steady opening bursts from @entity89 and @entity110 , @entity8 pulled away during a second - wicket stand of 153 in 30 overs between @entity34 and @entity123			2
@entity124 was as tidy as ever , but @entity125 reverted to the scruffiness that marred his performances at the start of the series , and eight wides took @entity3 ’s series tally to 65			0
@entity1 lamented : ‘ this is a good reality - check			2
we have to stay tight as a team			0
’ there are many who feel he should already have played his final game in a one - day shirt .			0

@entity1 dropped @entity34 and then made just one
@entity56 passed fifty but the *damage* had already been done
@entity21 was out for a first - ball duck as @entity3 struggled
