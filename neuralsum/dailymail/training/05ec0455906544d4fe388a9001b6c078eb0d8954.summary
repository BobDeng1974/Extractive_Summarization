by @entity1 reporter published : 18:05 est , 9 march 2013 updated : 18:05 est , 9 march 2013 a @entity3 newspaper accused of being racist after it published a poster with the words ' @entity6 ' written in an oriental - style typeface claims the slogan was just a play on words and was n't meant to offend			1
the @entity12 in @entity13 sparked outrage after it printed the back - page poster on thursday to support local high school @entity16 against @entity17 in a state championship basketball game			1
but the newspaper published an editorial today defending the decision , claiming the words did not constitute racism			1
offensive : the @entity12 in @entity13 , @entity3 , has been criticized for the poster , pictured ' we sought a simple play on words in support of an extraordinary group of local student athletes			1
indulging our critics for a moment , the outcry reminds us that racial and ethnic stereotypes can offend - regardless of intent , ' the editorial , presumably written by publisher @entity32 , said			2
it acknowledged that the chosen font , ' evoked a particular ethnic cuisine ' but did not constitute a racist slur			2
' we do n't concede , however , that the use of imagery with any racial , ethnic or religious inference is to inherently debase that race / ethnicity / religion , ' the newspaper said			0
' a fair accusation of racism would at least pre-require the reference to actually be demeaning or degrading , ' the editorial said			2
' simply invoking ethnic customs ( food , dress , design ) does n't do that , nor does it suggest any kind of characteristic about the culture , its people or a history of oppression by the majority			0
' but the editorial missed the point , said the president of the @entity67 , who had criticized the poster after it was published			1
support : the poster used a print type associated with @entity74 calligraphy for the words ' @entity6 ' to urge a local school to beat its opponent @entity17 , pictured , in a state basketball game ' i 'm not criticizing the @entity12 for rooting for their home team , ' said @entity82 , the association 's president			1
while @entity82 does not believe the newspaper 's intention was to be racist , it showed ' a lapse of judgment and poor taste			0
' ' it evoked a racial undertone and a negative stereotype , ' said @entity82 , who is also interactive and graphics editor for @entity94			0
@entity82 's original letter to the publisher of the @entity12 on friday said that the slogan by itself might be considered clever , but was offensive when written in that particular typeface			1
' it became offensive when published in a typeface mimicking @entity74 calligraphy , ' wrote @entity82			1
' we 'll assume that your use of that typeface was not meant to offend			0
but we 'll also assume that if that is the case , the @entity12 will publicly acknowledge its lapses in taste and judgment , ' he said in the letter			2
@entity16 's high school basketball team played @entity112 , of @entity113 , for the championship thursday			1
@entity115 won 48 - 40 in overtime			0
school : the top of the page read : ' go " @entity120 , " ' referring to the nickname of @entity16 's high school , pictured the newspaper ran the poster on the back page of thursday front section			1
the top of the page read : ' go " @entity120 , " ' referring to the school 's @entity129 nickname			0
across the bottom of the page were the words ' @entity6 ' in the style meant to resemble @entity74 calligraphy			0
@entity16 , a private school , serves local students and also has boarding students from across the world , including @entity139			2
academy headmaster @entity140 said friday the school had nothing to do with the poster , its design or its publication			0
' we appreciate the @entity12 's support of our teams , and we know for a fact that its intention was to support our boys in their championship run by using a clever play on the name of our opponent , ' @entity140 said			1
he said none of the school 's @entity158 students were offended by the poster			0
' overall , our students often see such things as a way to celebrate their culture , not demean it			0
and in this case , we chose to follow our students ' lead and look at the @entity170 's intent , not taking offense where none was intended , ' @entity140 said			0
once @entity16 officials saw the posters at the game , they did their best to remove them from the cheering section , he said .			2

the @entity12 in @entity13 published a poster using an oriental - looking typeface for the words ' @entity181 '
the poster was designed to cheer on @entity16 against @entity17 in a state championship basketball game
the @entity67 *labelled* the poster ' offensive '
but editorial today claims the words did not constitute racism
