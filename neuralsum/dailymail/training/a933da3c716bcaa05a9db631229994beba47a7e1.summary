by @entity0 @entity1 : 08:12 est , 17 december 2013 @entity2 : 13:09 est , 17 december 2013 from snowmen to penguins and @entity6 , festive jumpers have become a seasonal staple thanks to their cosy warmth and innocent motifs			0
but one @entity11 pensioner had a slightly naughtier scenario in mind when she created her range of reindeer themed knits			2
instead of an classic snowy scene , grandmother - of - nine @entity19 's festive jumpers feature a pair of reindeers enjoying a private moment			1
entrepreneurial spirit : grandmother @entity19 ( left ) with husband @entity25 and grandson @entity26 ( centre ) the £ 34.99 knit , which comes in a range of festive colours , including red , navy and green , also includes a classic snowflake pattern and is made by helpers supervised by @entity35			1
the pensioner , 75 , who hails from the small village of @entity38 just outside of @entity39 , set up her @entity6 jumper business this year but has been creating knits for her family since 2008			1
so popular did the creations prove , grandson @entity26 persuaded her to join forces with him to sell the knits online			0
luckily for those with delicate stomachs , the @entity49 range also includes designs featuring reindeers in less compromising situations , as well as traditional snowmen and @entity6 trees			0
unisex : the x-rated design is available in a choice of colours and on jumpers for both men and women but it 's the ' humping reindeer ' motif that has proved most popular , with mrs @entity19 's husband @entity25 among fans of the design			1
' why not spread the joy and delight that my jumpers bring to people across the world ? ' said the unrepentant mrs @entity19 of her naughty range of knits			0
' while my cheeky ‘ humping reindeer ’ might not be to everyone ’s taste , it does highlight that @entity6 is about both giving and receiving			2

the ' humping reindeer ' design was created by grandmother @entity19 , 75
her business was set up this year but she first knitted the design in 2008
the @entity88 jumper features the *animals* enjoying a private moment
