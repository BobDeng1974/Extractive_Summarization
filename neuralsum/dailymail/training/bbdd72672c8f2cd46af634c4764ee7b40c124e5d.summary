a gorilla born just five days ago at a zoo in @entity2 has died after ' complications ' feeding him			1
the male baby - who had not been named - seemed healthy and strong when he was born last wednesday at @entity6 in @entity7			1
but the tiny primate fell ill and was dead less than a week later - after he apparently did n't feed properly from his mother			1
zookeepers said that despite seeming to have a strong maternal instinct straight away , new mother @entity11 would cradle him out of sight - raising the prospect that she was n't feeding him			1
he was five days old motherly love : the baby , pictured above with his mother , @entity24 , could have died due to ' complication ' feeding , zookeepers said in a statement posted monday , zoo officials said @entity11 showed all the signs of a strong maternal bond with her son , but that they kept their distances to minimize stress on the new mother			1
they said : ' it is with a very heavy heart that we announce the passing of the baby gorilla that was born at @entity6 to first - time mother @entity24 on wednesday , november 19			1
' the baby had appeared as if he was doing well through saturday evening			0
he had a strong grip and was vocal			0
@entity11 was showing positive signs of maternal instinct , had been observed nursing and cradling the baby			0
' despite best efforts to monitor and record the baby â€™s food intake , many times @entity11 would cradle her baby to her chest with her back towards the observing zookeepers making it difficult to determine when and if nursing was indeed taking place			1
cradled : @entity11 had a strong maternal bond , officials said			2
but they could not be sure whether he was properly fed because @entity11 would cradle him while turning away from watching zookeepers ' to prevent undue stress on new mothers , and allow them the necessary time to bond with their baby , it is imperative that zoo staff and veterinarians not intervene unless absolutely necessary			2
' on sunday morning it was apparent that the baby was weak and his health failing			0
while the intervention process was happening the baby was set down by @entity11 and the zookeepers were able to retrieve him without the need to immobilize @entity11			2
' resuscitation efforts on the infant were quickly preformed but were unsuccessful			0
' @entity76 soared when the baby was born wednesday , as video footage showed the 4lbs baby in his mother 's arms			1
the newborn was the first of his kind to be born at the zoo in its 55 - year history of gorilla care and conservation			2
troubles : vets tried to resuscitate the baby after they realized he was likely to do - but their efforts were unsuccessful a gorilla mother is very protective of her babies and will carry them on her chest for the first three months - making it difficult to interfere			2
the babies then ride on their mother 's back at around six months old and begin playing on the ground close by			0
more than a quarter of male gorilla babies survive for less than a year after being born in captivity , figures show			0
the mortality rate in the wild is even worse			0
some 26 per cent of males born since 1980 , and 20 per cent of females , did not make it to their first birthday , according to the @entity111 figures from the wild peg death rates at around 42 per cent .			0
