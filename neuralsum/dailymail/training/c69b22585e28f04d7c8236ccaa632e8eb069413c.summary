by @entity1 - squire published : 17:47 est , 17 august 2012 updated : 17:47 est , 17 august 2012 after 11 fruitless visits to her doctor over three years , @entity2 was beginning to think that her severe earache would never be cured			1
over that time , the 28 - year - old , an @entity7 administration manager , was prone to temporarily losing all hearing in her blocked and swollen right ear , and bouts of ' unbearable ' pain that caused her to take time off work			1
then , one day , while putting in yet more eardrops as prescribed by the doctor , a ladybird 's head fell out of her ear			1
painful : after 11 fruitless visits to the doctor , @entity2 , from @entity22 , eventually discovered that a @entity23 was responsible for the ' unbearable pain ' and temporary deafness in her left ear it was then that she remembered that around the time her symptoms first began with a tickling sensation in august 2009 , she was convinced that something had crawled into her ear			1
mrs @entity2 , who lives with husband @entity31 , 32 , a landscaper , said : ' a few nights earlier i 'd felt sure a bug had crawled in my ear and was so relieved when my gp said he could n't see any insect in there			1
' this time , however , she was finally referred to hospital , where an @entity41 specialist removed the rest of the perfectly preserved ladybird			2
yesterday mrs @entity2 , who is making a formal complaint to the surgery , said : ' it sounds funny but i thought i was going mad			1
' it 's made my life a nightmare			0
i just ca n't believe no one saw it			0
after all , it must be the brightest , spottiest bug in the @entity54			2
' by may 2010 she had already gone back to the surgery six times			2
' i kept on getting ear infections and deafness , ' she said			0
hard to spot : mrs @entity2 said doctors told her they could not see anything in her ear , however when she went to see an ear nose and throat specialist he noticed the insect and removed it ' at restaurants i had to position myself at the table so my left ear was turned towards people speaking and walking along a road with someone i had to walk to their right so i could hear them properly			1
' @entity31 got fed up having to say everything twice to me			0
' before this i was rarely ill. but i 've had to have two lots of time off work because the pain was unbearable and the antibiotics i 've had to take ruined my immune system leaving me prone to lots of colds			2
' last year and earlier this year , she went back to the @entity87 surgery near her home in @entity89 , @entity22 , a further five times			1
by that point , doctors had issued mrs @entity2 with a total of 12 prescriptions of earspray , eardrops , antibiotics and painkillers , none of which managed to solve the problem			2
she said : ' one doctor did see something but diagnosed it as a " glob of wax "			0
' it was only in june this year when putting some eardrops in , that the head and jaws of a ladybird fell out of my hand that i recalled the night i believed the insect had crawled in			1
' mrs @entity2 took the beetle 's head to show her gp , who finally referred her to an @entity41 consultant			1
creepy crawly : mrs @entity2 remembered that her symptoms first began with a tickling sensation in august 2009 , she was convinced that something had crawled into her ear she said : ' waiting six weeks for the appointment was difficult as by then the deafness and discomfort in that ear was getting worse			1
' however , within five minutes the consultant had removed the insect 's body			0
mrs @entity2 said : ' we could clearly see from its spots it was a ladybird			2
i was instantly able to hear again and that was such a relief			0
' but i feel angry			0
i was made to feel i was making a fuss about nothing and feel i should have been referred to a specialist much earlier			0
' dr @entity137 , a consultant @entity41 surgeon from @entity139 , said : ' it would appear the ladybird was hiding behind some wax			0
' a gp surgery does not possess the same level of equipment that an ent specialist department has , so it appears when doctors looked into the ear , all they saw was wax			0
' because the insect body was encased in wax , it would have stopped the air getting to it so it would n't have degraded			0

@entity2 visited doctor 11 times to try and cure unbearable ear pain
@entity7 administrator had been convinced something had crawled into her ear in 2009
@entity23 head fell out of her ear earlier this year
hearing returned instantly when bug was removed
