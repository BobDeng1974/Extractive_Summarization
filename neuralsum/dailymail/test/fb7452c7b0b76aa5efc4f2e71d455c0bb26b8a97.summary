the @entity0 is officially going on sale today - but none of its stores will have them in stock @entity0 launches its first smartwatch today - but anyone turning up to buy one in the high street will be disappointed			1
for although the @entity0 is officially going on sale , none of its stores will have them in stock			1
instead , consumers willing to shell out between £ 299 to £ 13,500 - for the gold edition - have to pre-order the watches online and wait for their arrival until june			1
usually , @entity0 launches generate long queues outside stores			1
but @entity22 analysts believe the company feared the queues might be embarrassingly small and so opted to launch the watch with more of a whisper than a bang			1
in fact , despite the high price and some skepticism that consumers are keen to adopt a new generation of wearable technology , pre-orders have far exceeded expectations			1
as a result , the company 's initial production run is simply not large enough to ensure that watches will be available in stores from today			2
analysts believe @entity0 is sitting on some two million pre-orders and that sales could top 20 million this year			1
the watch includes a host of personal trackers , including a heart rate monitor , and is being billed as a personal doctor that will help users to lose weight and improve their health			0
however , @entity0 also wants it to be seen as style statement and fashion accessory , with customers able to choose from any of 38 variants depending on the case and watch strap			2
as a result , limited supplies have been given to six designer outlets around the world , which will apparently be sold to a few select customers by appointment today			2
these include the exclusive @entity67 in @entity69 's @entity68 , which is understood to have 570 of the watches , although not the gold edition			0
the launch of the watch into stores is being handled by @entity0 retail chief , @entity75 , who is very familiar with the world of designer labels			1
she was head of the luxury @entity79 fashion label @entity78 , where she was one of the @entity79 's highest paid women executives , before joining the @entity82 company last may			0
her recruitment was sweetened with a golden hello of shares worth around £ 40million			2
she told @entity0 staff via video message earlier this week that the decision to make the watch only available through online orders is because demand has exceeded supply			1
in it she said : ' we know that you have been bombarded with questions from customers			0
' luckily , the customer feedback has been overwhelmingly positive			0
we know they are excited about the watch ... but there are a lot of questions about availability and timing etc. ' last week we announced that due to the high global interest and the initial supply that we would only be taking orders online right now			0
' this was not an easy decision , and i think it 's really important to remind every single customer that this is not just a new product for us , this is an entirely new category			0
' the official @entity0 @entity79 website states anyone ordering the new watch can expect a delivery date in june , however some might get them before			1
@entity0 chief executive @entity123 pictured giving a presentation on the @entity0 in @entity125 last month a spokesman said : ' our team is working to fill orders as quickly as possible based on the available supply and the order in which they were received			2
we know many customers are still facing long lead times and we appreciate their patience			0
' @entity136 , technology expert and founder of website @entity138 , said : ' i think the watch will follow the same lines of success as the @entity144 did five years ago			0
it 's an intriguing device that has enough wow factor to pull people in			0
' but he added that the change in buying process this time - and the online backlog that has already begun - could put some people off			2
' the biggest problem @entity0 looks to be facing , is not if people will buy one , it 's whether they are going to be happy to wait until they can get one , ' he said			1
@entity157 , editor - in - chief of gadget @entity158 , said : ' in many ways the @entity0 is the ultimate gadget			1
beautifully made and finished , hugely desirable and capable of a host of clever things , none of which you need , but many of which are nice to have			0
' the functionality that could end up most compelling is messaging - the ability to send scrawled drawings , emoticons and even your heart beat direct to another @entity175 owner feels personal in a way no other message platform does			0
' he added : ' the one - day battery life and price are the two factors that will put many buyers off			0
£ 300 or more is a lot to pay for a first - generation device , especially as @entity0 will learn a lot about making it better once it 's in the market			1
' that means the second or third - generation @entity0 is probably the wiser buy			1
however , waiting would mean missing out on the fun of living with an entirely new , cutting - edge gadget right now , and for early adopters , that will be too much to bear			0
' industry commentators believe the @entity0 will follow the same lines of success as the @entity144 ( pictured ) did five years ago			2

@entity0 launches its first smartwatch today - but its stores will not stock it
online consumers must shell out £ 300 and then wait for a june delivery
analysts believe @entity0 feared queues may have been embarrassingly small
however , it is believed @entity0 is sitting on some two million pre-orders
