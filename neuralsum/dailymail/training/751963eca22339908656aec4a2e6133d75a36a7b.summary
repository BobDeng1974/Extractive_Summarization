@entity1 spies foiled a @entity3 attack on @entity4 in @entity5 while @entity1 troops were still in the country			1
eavesdroppers at @entity9 exposed the plot by monitoring chatter between an insurgent and other militants			1
the agency had mounted its biggest overseas deployment since the @entity16 by running a string of listening posts across southern @entity5 to protect @entity1 soldiers			1
an earlier assault on @entity4 – in september 2012 – cost the lives of two @entity23 marines , saw five @entity25 personnel injured and ended with the destruction of fighter jets worth £ 130million			1
@entity1 spies foiled a @entity3 attack on @entity4 in @entity5 while @entity1 troops were still in the country it was only because of the ability of @entity9 analysts to access large amounts of data to search for previously unknown security threats that the plan was foiled			1
following @entity39 ’s revelations about the surveillance capabilities of @entity23 and @entity1 intelligence agencies , privacy campaigners have called to curb these powers			1
it is understood the rate of military operations led by intelligence gathered by @entity9 rose over the course of the conflict to more than half of all missions			2
such intelligence proved vital after the first assault on @entity4 in @entity54 province when insurgents breached security at the base in september 2012			1
they killed two @entity59 , injured five @entity25 personnel and destroyed fighter jets worth £ 130 million			1
in the following months , officials from the intelligence agency in @entity1 identified an insurgent who , until then , had been unknown to them			2
the man had been communicating with known militants			0
the discovery triggered further analysis and a @entity3 network – at least ten strong – was uncovered			0
coverage on the target was immediately increased and a team of between 20 and 30 analysts in @entity1 , and two @entity9 officials based in @entity5 , discovered the target was @entity4			1
they found the method of attack planned to be remarkably similar to the earlier attack , in which the @entity3 broke through the base ’s perimeter dressed in @entity23 army uniforms in the darkness			2
despite wearing training shoes instead of boots and having beards , the coalition forces on the base only realised they were insurgents when they opened fire with rocket - propelled grenades			0
an earlier assault on @entity4 ( now empty , pictured ) – in september 2012 – cost the lives of two @entity23 marines , saw five @entity25 personnel injured and ended with the destruction of fighter jets worth £ 130million in the latest case , as the militants made their way to @entity4 , a military operation was authorised that ‘ broke up ’ the gang before they could kill @entity1 and @entity23 soldiers			1
the operation took place in the @entity105 district in april last year and the @entity3 forces were captured , according to the @entity107			0
the intelligence operation to stop the attack relied on the ability of @entity9 to access ‘ bulk data ’ on the internet – a technique that had led to it being accused of conducing ‘ mass surveillance ’			2
@entity116 , a former official at the agency , told the @entity118 : ‘ this sort of vital operational intelligence can only be achieved through accessing bulk data under the current strict legal environment			0
’ the access to the data gives @entity9 the ability to search out a needle in a haystack , the agency contends			0
@entity9 officials played an increasingly important frontline role in @entity1 ’s 13 - year war in @entity5 , earning some 156 campaign service medals			1
intelligence officers arrived in @entity5 shortly after combat troops were sent to help topple the @entity3 regime in late 2001			0
by the peak of the campaign the @entity5 mission had become the agency ’s second largest task , after counter terrorism			0
while the bulk of the work was undertaken remotely , the agency benefited from having a number of people on the ground			0
at any one time it had around 30 staff in the country , backed by a team of around 90 back in the @entity1			0
@entity9 operated 10 secret posts inside often remote @entity1 military bases across @entity54 and the south			1
its operations climaxed over the course of 2014 , monitoring @entity3 communications to thwart plans to hit vulnerable @entity1 convoys as they withdrew from bases across @entity54			2
the agency has flown out more than 400 tons of monitoring and technical equipment as part of the withdrawal			0
the equipment , equivalent to 100 shipping containers worth , was six times more kit than the agency deployed during @entity1 ’s post- 2003 @entity170 campaign			0
at the height of the campaign , when @entity1 troops were being killed and mutilated by homemade bombs , @entity9 waged its own battle trying to identify and target commanders smuggling bomb - making equipment into the country from @entity180			2
analysts identified and stopped one commander ferrying more than 15 tonnes of precursor explosives across the border .			0

@entity9 exposed the plot by monitoring an insurgent and other militants
@entity190 mounted its biggest overseas deployment since @entity16
had listening posts across @entity5 to protect @entity1 soldiers
an assault on @entity4 in september 2012 cost lives of two @entity23 marines , injured five @entity25 personnel destroyed fighter jets
