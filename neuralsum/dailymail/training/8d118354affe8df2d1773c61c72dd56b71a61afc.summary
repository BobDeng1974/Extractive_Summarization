by @entity0 for young striker @entity3 , when the diagnosis finally arrived , it was brutal and unexpected			1
despite having lingering doubts about a mole on his cheek , the - then 19 - year - old had been told by no less than four medical professionals that there was nothing to worry about			1
even when @entity3 finally convinced his doctor to arrange a biopsy , the information given out as he waited on his results was that there was a nine in ten chance that everything was fine			1
so when the @entity22 striker , who was on loan at @entity24 at the time , learned in january , a month before turning 20 , that he had melanoma skin cancer , it was news that would have shaken a far older man to his very core			1
fighting spirit : @entity22 's @entity3 has overcome skin cancer instead , @entity3 steeled himself and stayed strong as parents @entity31 and @entity33 fell to pieces in front of him at learning their little boy was suffering from the most dangerous skin cancer of all			1
after briefly succumbing to shock himself , the courageous @entity3 instinctively knew the key to overcoming the biggest battle of his life was straightforward			1
no matter what lay ahead , this impressive and eloquent youngster simply vowed that cancer would never be allowed ruin his childhood dream of becoming a professional footballer			1
' it was just a little freckle to begin with but it grew into a mole ' , said @entity3 , who mercifully has been given the all - clear and is now on a mission to raise awareness of melanoma			1
' people were telling me to get it checked out because it was getting bigger but i put it off			2
then it started bleeding so i went to the doctor , but he said it was nothing			2
i actually went to three or four doctors and they all said the same thing – none of them thought it was anything to worry about			2
they thought it looked like a regular mole			2
@entity69 blow : @entity3 discovered the news while he was on loan at @entity24 ' but i kept going back until they took a biopsy in january			1
i was n’t prepared for what they were about to tell me because they said when the biopsy was done that there was a 90 per cent chance it was nothing			2
' but when i went in for the result , with my mum and dad , they told me i had melanoma skin cancer , which is the worst kind you can get			1
' i did n’t know a thing about it so i googled ‘ melanoma skin cancer ’ when i came out of the surgery			1
but that was the worst thing i could have done			2
i read the first line and closed the page immediately because i did n’t want to read any more			2
' i knew i had to be strong for my mum and dad but when they both burst into tears , that was harder for me			2
then i went out and phoned ( @entity24 coach ) @entity101 and i started crying down the phone myself			2
raising awareness : @entity3 is speaking up to warn people of the danger of skin cancer ' my emotions took over , i did n’t know what else to do			1
but i was able to push myself on by thinking about my football			2
nothing will stop me playing football			2
' being back fit and playing for @entity22 is what drove me on throughout the whole thing			2
i actually feel bad for people who do n’t have a goal like that to aim at because it must be even more difficult for them to cope with something like this			0
i do n’t know how they deal with it because mentally cancer is at you constantly			1
' now , all i want is to get fit for pre-season and score goals for @entity22 this season			0
if i get the chance i think i can do it			0
and all i can say to people out there is that if they have any moles they think might be something then definitely go out and get it checked			0
' for @entity3 , the pain of living with cancer was not confined to just mental torment			1
' i had two operations , the second one lasted for 11 hours and was major surgery , ' he said			0
' they took lymph nodes out of my neck and i have scars on my neck			0
i do n’t have any nerves on one side of my face and my bottom lip does n’t work properly			0
' but that ’s nothing , and anyway having no feeling in one side of my face means i can take elbows to the face easier			0
' i ’ve been given the all - clear now			1
but i still get scanned every three months from now on and i have to check myself every week in case anything comes back			0
' but hopefully that ’s it for me now and i can focus on playing for @entity22			0
i have just been looking forward to getting back to playing football			0
that ’s all i want to do			0
' @entity158 : @entity159 ( left ) and @entity160 helped @entity3 during his dark days @entity3 still marvels at the way the football families at @entity163 and @entity164 rallied round for him			1
the youngster ’s ordeal clearly placed the emphasis on ‘ united ’ at @entity22 , particularly when his teammates all wore @entity3 t - shirts in his honour during a thrilling 5 - 1 @entity172 win over @entity173 at home in april			1
' it was such a great feeling to see the lads wearing the t - shirts for me , ' he said			1
' when @entity178 scored and lifted his t - shirt up it definitely made me feel stronger			1
it made me know that everyone was behind me pushing me on			0
' i had been told in the morning that they were doing something like that			0
i grew up with ( @entity22 first team defender ) @entity187 and the rest of the lads so they arranged it			0
' i will never be able to repay everyone for the support they gave me			0
all the boys came down to see me in the hospital			0
they came in a mini-bus			0
@entity197 ( @entity198 ) , @entity199 ( @entity200 ) , @entity202 ( @entity201 ) and the whole coaching staff came down as well			0
support : @entity22 manager @entity198 and his players rallied around @entity3 ' our captain @entity206 was up straight away and the @entity24 lads came along too			1
there were so many people there all the nurses swarmed up to the ward as well to see us			0
sometimes i had 15 people at once in the room but the nurses did n’t bother			0
' united youth - coach @entity159 praised @entity3 for his mental fortitude in fighting such an illness at such a young age , and for raising awareness of such a deadly disease			1
' it ’s very admirable how @entity3 and his family have coped with such an incredibly tough situation , ' said @entity159			1
' @entity226 ’s humour and positivity were a major help			0
when i told him the news had broken in the local paper , he said he knew but he was annoyed that they ’d got his goals tally wrong			0
that ’s just typical @entity3 and it ’s great that we are now talking about his football again			1
he ’s a terrific striker and hopefully he ’ s now got a great career in front of him			0
