at the age of 13 , @entity0 thought nothing of jumping on a sunbed to take the last few minutes of her mother 's session			1
when she was younger , her mother had been diagnosed with psoriasis and believed using sunbeds would help her skin condition			2
lured by the glamorous pictures of tanned women on the walls of the sunbed salon , miss @entity0 believed two sessions a week was good for her health , helping boost her vitamin d levels			1
but six years later while watching @entity19 's @entity18 , the then 19 - year - old realised the dangers , noticing changes to a mole on her leg			1
miss @entity0 had the most deadly form of skin cancer , melanoma , which can spread quickly to other parts of the body			1
today the 22 - year - old is in remission and is an ardent critic of sunbeds , urging young people to opt for safer , fake tanning products			1
she has shunned sunbeds for the last years , and now shelters under umbrellas while on holiday to avoid the midday sun. she told this morning : ' my mum was diagnosed with psoriasis when she was younger			1
' she was in hospital for six weeks and was treated with sunbeds and so we thought they were beneficial			2
' when i was younger i would jump on for the last few minutes of her sessions			0
' @entity63 salons are full of pictures of beautiful women on the walls , it implies there are health benefits and there is lots of advertising saying vitamin d is good for your health			0
but miss @entity0 told this morning , six years later , when she was 19 she was diagnosed with melanoma , the most aggressive form of skin cancer ' we do n't get much sun here so i thought it was totally beneficial			1
' in 2005 , when miss @entity0 was just 13 , it was illegal for anyone under the age of 16 to use a sunbed			1
today the age limit has been raised and it is currently illegal for anyone under the age of 18 to use one			0
but miss @entity0 said she never had a problem persuading staff in sunbed shops that she was old enough			1
while people questioned her age , they took her word for it that she was over 16			0
by the time she was 16 , miss @entity0 was regularly using sunbeds at least twice a week			1
and she said , many of her peers at school were jumping on the sunbed wagon			0
' lots of the boys at school suffered acne and so would go on sunbeds to clear their skin up , ' the now 22 - year - old said			1
' coming into school burned , and saying we had been on a sunbed , which you had to be 16 to go on , was almost a badge of honour			0
' but for @entity117 , who naturally has pale skin dotted with freckles and moles , the years of exposure to harmful uv rays took its toll			0
miss @entity0 first noticed changes to a mole on her left leg , after watching @entity19 's @entity18 show where a woman was discussing her case of skin cancer at the age of 19 , miss @entity0 had two moles removed , one from her left leg leaving a 9cm scar ( pictured ) , and another from her stomach skin cancer is one of the most common cancers in the world			1
there are two types - melanoma , which spreads very quickly in the body , and non-melanoma , which is more common			0
melanoma is a rare and serious type of cancer , which begins in the skin and spreads to other organs in the body			0
a new mole or a change in an existing mole is a typical sign of skin cancer			1
this can happen anywhere on the body , but most often on the legs , back , arms and face			0
around 13,300 people in the @entity160 are diagnosed with melanoma each year			2
it is the fifth most common cancer overall in the country , excluding non-melanoma skin cancer			2
the number of people being diagnosed with melanoma is four times higher than it was 30 years ago			2
exposure to ultraviolet light increases a person 's risk of developing melanoma			0
the more moles a person has on their body , the higher their risk of developing the disease			0
those with a lot of moles and freckly skin should be very careful in the sun. having fair skin and a tendency to get sunburn will also increase a person 's risk			0
source : @entity190 and @entity191 at the age of 19 , when she was watching an episode of @entity19 's @entity18 , miss @entity0 realised there were dangers associated with using sunbeds			1
' the doctor was talking to a girl , and he pointed out the @entity200 theory - asymmetry , border and colour , ' she said			0
' i noticed a change on one of my moles on my leg and thought i had to go to the doctors			2
' i was referred to a dermatologist who told me i would have to have the mole removed			0
' she added : ' they called me early with my results so i had an idea something was wrong			0
' you hope for the best but expect the worst , but even then i did n't expect skin cancer at 19			2
' today the 22 - year - old is in remission but faces regular check - ups with her dermatologist to check for any more changes on her body			1
the ordeal has changed miss @entity0 's life for ever			2
for three years she has shunned sunbeds , opting for spray tans instead			1
and when she is in natural sunlight on holiday , the 22 - year - old uses factor 50 suncream and sits under umbrellas , avoiding the midday sun. she is urging young people to avoid using sunbeds , instead opting for fake tan alternatives			1
dr @entity235 , @entity236 's resident doctor who himself had skin cancer twice as a result of using sunbeds 40 years ago before the dangers were widely known , said melanoma is detectable and more importantly preventable			1
he urged people to watch out for changes to moles and freckles on their skin , watching for a change in size and colour , checking whether moles feel itchy , are bleeding or flaking			1
the 22 - year - old is now in remission and is urging other young people not to use harmful sunbeds , raising awareness of the dangers they pose a recent survey by @entity191 found people in @entity27 are at highest risk of being diagnosed with skin cancer , with 40 per cent of people admitting they use sunbeds at least once a week			1
@entity261 , chair of the @entity262 told this morning : ' the survey was undertaken soon after the law banning sunbed use by under 18s and the legislation has had a positive impact on underage use			0
' @entity63 salons are full of pictures of beautiful women on the walls , it implies there are health benefits and there is lots of advertising saying vitamin d is good for your health ' - @entity0 ' our code of practice prohibits underage use as just one element of the screening process			2
' properly trained staff offer customers information about responsible use			0
' past surveys by @entity191 in 2012 and 2009 linked sunbed use to an increased risk of getting skin cancer			2
in 2012 , an analysis of 27 studies revealed people have an increase in risk if they have ever used a sunbed			0
and the risk was highest for people who used a sunbed before the age of 35			0
the 2009 study found people who have regularly used a sunbed before the age of 30 have a 75 per cent increase in their risk of developing melanoma .			0

@entity0 first used sunbeds when she was just 13 years old
she thought they were beneficial , boosting vitamin d and helping the skin
but at 19 she noticed changes to a mole and was diagnosed with melanoma
melanoma is the most aggressive form of skin cancer , quickly spreading
the now 22 - year - old had two moles removed from her leg and stomach
she has shunned sunbeds for three years and now only spray tans
miss @entity0 urged other people to stop using sunbeds to avoid cancer
