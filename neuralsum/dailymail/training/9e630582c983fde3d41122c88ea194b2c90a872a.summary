@entity1 , from @entity2 , already had an ' atrocious ' criminal record for violence against women when he targeted the 68 - year - old at a pub in @entity2 in february this year			1
the 46 - year - old , who was described in court as ' dangerous ' , then went back to the woman 's home where he locked the door , tied her up with tape and stole her jewellery			1
he then subjected her to horrific sex attacks in an ordeal which did not end until the next morning			1
at the time of the brutal attack , @entity1 was out of jail on licence after being locked up in september 2012 for stabbing another woman in the face and neck			1
in a victim impact statement , the woman said she had been so disturbed by the incident that she had moved out of her home and left behind most of her belongings ' that this man had touched '			2
@entity1 has now been jailed for life after a jury at @entity42 found him guilty of two offences of rape and one of robbery			1
the jury of nine women and three men rejected his claims during the trial that his victim had consented to sex			2
@entity1 , who was arrested two days after the attack , was told he must serve a minimum of nine years in prison before he can apply to the parole board for release			1
judge @entity59 told him : ' it was cruel			0
it was nasty , and it shows you for what you are			2
' in my judgement you are a dangerous man			0
dangerous in the sense that if you are at large you are ever likely to commit offences of this kind and commit serious physical harm to another human being			0
' the court heard @entity1 armed himself with the knife before targeting the ' trusting and vulnerable ' victim when they met during a night out			1
prosecutors also told the jury how the defendant had a long criminal history of serious violent offences			2
one attack involved a woman suffering an eye injury when she was struck in the face with a pistol , while the attack for which he was on licence had led to a three - and - a - half year prison sentence			1
the court also heard that @entity1 had spent almost every day of his life in prison since 2002			2
the victim said : ' since this man did this to me i have n’t been right			0
@entity42 heard that @entity1 was out of jail on licence for stabbing another woman in the face and neck when the brutal attack took place ' i get upset and i end up crying and i ca n’t sleep at night and i ’ve had to stay at my sister ’s because i just ca n’t settle on my own at home			1
' i ca n’t even say what it is that makes me cry but the things this man did to me ran through my mind and i am really frightened			0
' in my judgement you are a dangerous man			0
if you are at large ... you are ever likely to commit serious physical harm to another human being ' judge @entity59 ' after the incident i did n’t go back into my house , which had been my home for five years			0
i am frightened of him coming back because he said that if i told anyone he would come looking for me and would kill me			0
' it is because of this i have given up my home and moved out of the area			0
' i did not even take anything out of the house other than my clothes , microwave and stereo as i could n’t face having the same things in my new home that this man had touched because this would remind me every day about the horrible and nasty things this man had done to me			0
' det chief inspector @entity132 , who heads @entity133 , said : ' these offences clearly show that @entity1 is a sexual predator who presents a serious danger to women			1
' we believe he cynically preyed on the vulnerable victim from the outset and had sinister intentions towards her all along			2
she was put through a prolonged ordeal which has understandably had a lasting traumatic effect on her			0
' police enquiries quickly identified @entity1 as the suspect for these offences and he was traced to the city centre and arrested the next day after being recognised by officers patrolling the area			1
' a full and thorough investigation by specialist safeguarding officers has seen him brought to justice and we hope the fact he has now had to answer for his crimes will provide some source of comfort to the victim			0
