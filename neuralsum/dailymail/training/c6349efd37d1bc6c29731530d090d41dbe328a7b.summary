by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 11:45 est , 9 april 2013 @entity3 : 14:21 est , 31 december 2013 a liberal magazine in @entity5 has published secretly recorded audio of a strategy session , in which @entity10 minority leader @entity9 's aides discussed how to use actress @entity12 's history of mental illness against her in a political opposition strategy			1
the recording includes @entity17 's voice , advising his staffers that ' this is the " @entity20 " period of the campaign , ' referring to the popular carnival game involving a foam sledgehammer and a series of underground rodents			1
' when anybody sticks their head up , do them out			0
' other meeting participants said @entity12 was ' emotionally unbalanced , ' that she had ' suicidal tendencies , ' and that she ' described having children as selfish			1
' @entity12 was also openly hostile to ' traditional @entity34 , ' the meeting heard			2
@entity17 campaign director @entity35 told @entity36 that the campaign has asked the @entity38 to investigate			1
the february 2 conversation was part of a ' private senior strategist meeting , with a very small number of attendees , ' @entity35 said			2
' a " family meeting , " if you will			0
' asked for a specific number , @entity35 said ' about half a dozen ' people were in the room			0
' the recording clearly came form some sort of recording or listening device planted in our office without permission , ' he said			0
' we 'll see what the @entity38 finds			0
' scroll down for audio actress @entity12 read off vote totals from the state of @entity63 - not @entity64 - during the presidential roll call vote at the @entity66 in 2012 senate minority leader @entity9 of @entity64 tod his aides to play ' @entity20 ' with @entity12 , a potential rival who ultimately decided not to run against him the liberal muckraking magazine @entity69 published the 11 - minute audio recording on tuesday , along with a transcript the magazine made waves with another secret political recording in 2012 when it published @entity76 's now - infamous claim that ' 47 percent ' of @entity1 would vote for @entity77 no matter what , because @entity77 would protect their government benefits in his second term			1
the recording itself will provide @entity84 @entity83 with fodder for months			0
' i refer to [ @entity12 ] as sort of the oppo [ sition ] research situation where there 's a haystack of needles , ' the @entity69 recording shows one @entity17 aide saying , ' just because truly , there ’s such a wealth of material			1
' ' she 's clearly - this sounds extreme - but she is emotionally unbalanced			1
i mean it 's been documented , ' the meeting 's leader said			2
' @entity35 can go in chapter and verse from her autobiography about , you know , she 's suffered some suicidal tendencies			1
she was hospitalized for 42 days when she had a mental breakdown in the ' 90s			0
@entity12 lives in @entity63 and spent ever - increasing amounts of time in @entity110 , but planned to run for the @entity1 @entity10 from @entity64 , where she was raised			1
her book , @entity113 , contained a wealth of opposition research for @entity116 , including recollections of her fight with mental illness in a recorded @entity121 interview played during the @entity17 staff meeting , @entity12 is heard explaining how the sight of a pair of socks in an airport shop could prompt an odd reaction upon returning to the @entity1 after overseas travel			1
' you know , i come back to this country			0
i freak out in airports , ' the group heard @entity12 say			2
' the colors , the sounds , ... the last time i came home from a trip , i absolutely flipped out when i saw pink fuzzy socks on a rack			0
i mean , i can never anticipate what is going to push me over the edge			2
' ' so pink fuzzy socks are of concern , ' the amused meeting leader joked			0
the group also heard that @entity12 ' is critical … of traditional @entity34			2
she sort of views it as sort of a vestige of patriarchy			0
she says @entity34 gives a @entity151 like a man , presented and discussed exclusively with male imagery , which legitimizes and seals male power			0
' @entity17 's native @entity64 is a bible - belt bastion of religious conservatism , a region where questions about @entity151 's gender would not play well in an election season			1
@entity12 announced on @entity162 that she would n't be running for @entity10 against @entity9 , but the secret ' family meeting ' at @entity17 headquarters happened weeks beforehand in another recording of @entity12 played during the meeting , she discussed her preference for ' native faith practices , ' saying she has ' a very nature - based @entity151 concept			1
' @entity69 reporter @entity171 argued that @entity12 has also publicly described herself as a garden - variety @entity34			2
but worse still for @entity12 - had she run for @entity10 - might have been campaign ammunition about her reported view that ' having children [ is ] selfish , ' and that ' she thinks it 's unconscionable to breed			1
' the group also discussed the usefulness of portraying @entity12 as a carpetbagger who would run for a @entity10 seat in @entity64 while being on record claiming @entity63 and @entity110 as her native home			1
' ' not only has she clearly claimed @entity63 as her home , ' a voice on the recording says , ' she 's actually mocked @entity64 to @entity63 audiences			1
she was bemoaning the low voter turnout among women in @entity63			2
she said , " @entity196 , that 's worse than even in @entity64			2
" ' that line of argument became part of the national conversation about @entity12 just four days later , with the release of a @entity203 video by the political group @entity204			1
in included a clip of @entity12 telling an audience near her home in @entity207 that one day , ' it just clicked : @entity63 is home			1
' the @entity210 highlighted one passage in her book , @entity209 , that could have become the subject of tv ads against her			0
' when i began to dream of making myself a home i could live in for the rest of my life , a home that would shelter me longer than anywhere i had ever lived before , this was the place the fates seemed to choose for me , ' she wrote in the memoir , referring to the 200 - year - old @entity63 farmhouse that has been her legal residence since the 1990s			2
in a statement earlier tuesday , the @entity17 campaign had painted the audio 's release to a liberal magazine as a political dirty trick			1
' we 've always said the @entity236 would stop at nothing to attack sen. @entity17 , but @entity239 - style tactics to bug campaign headquarters are above and beyond. , ' the statement read			2
' senator @entity17 's campaign is working with the @entity38 and has notified the local @entity1 attorney in @entity244 , per @entity38 request , about these recordings			1
obviously a recording device of some kind was placed in senator @entity17 's campaign office without consent			1
by whom and how that was accomplished presumably will be the subject of a criminal investigation			0
' problematic : @entity12 has called her @entity255 , @entity63 farmhouse home since the 1990s , which would have been an obstacle to her winning a @entity1 @entity10 election in neighboring @entity64 @entity17 campaign manager @entity35 ( with former boss @entity262 , @entity263 ) said the audio 's leak was the product of illegal wiretapping , and has asked the @entity38 to investigate in @entity64 , it is legal to make secret recordings of conversations , provided that at least one of the conversation 's participants is aware and gives consent			1
other states have so - called ' all - party ' consent laws , which provide that no one may be recorded without his or her permission			0
a federal law enforcement source told @entity36 that the @entity38 's involvement ' would typically commence after an illegally produced recording ' crossed state lines			0
' @entity69 magazine 's parent organization , the nonprofit @entity285 , is based in @entity110 , @entity287			0
reporter @entity171 , who broke the news tuesday , is based in @entity5 , @entity5 in a statement @entity171 provided after this story was first published , @entity69 magazine said it was ' recently provided the tape by a source who wished to remain anonymous			0
we were not involved in the making of the tape			0
' ' it is our understanding , ' the statement also said , ' that the tape was not the product of a @entity239 - style bugging operation			0
we can not comment beyond that			0
' @entity171 ( @entity263 ) has re-introduced the term ' @entity20 ' into the @entity1 political vocabulary with a leaked recording of sen. @entity9 and his staffers			0

opposition research showed @entity12 was ' emotionally unbalanced ' and had ' suicidal tendencies '
actress said ' i can never anticipate what is going to push me over the edge '
@entity17 campaign has asked @entity320 to investigate wiretapping *allegations*
meeting *focused* on @entity12 's @entity63 residency in @entity64 race , just 4 days before conservative group released @entity203 video on the same issue
