@entity0 is considering heading to @entity1 to prepare for his next fight in the belief that sparring partners are running scared after watching him go toe - to - toe with @entity5 and @entity6 super middleweight champion @entity7			1
the middleweight faces @entity10 ’s @entity9 for the @entity5 interim middleweight title , on the undercard of @entity13 versus @entity14 , at @entity16 ’s @entity15 on february 28			1
the fight will be @entity19 ’s first since suffering his first defeat to @entity21 last november			1
@entity0 ( right ) goes toe - to - toe with @entity7 early last year @entity19 says sparring partners have been scared off after watching the footage he maintains he should have got the decision over the @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 champion , but that his preparations for that fight had been undermined by a difficulty sourcing sparring partners since the emergence of video footage of him sparring with @entity7 before his rematch with @entity36 at @entity37 last may			1
‘ since i sparred with @entity7 and the footage went online , it ’s been hell to get any type of sparring partner , ’ said @entity19			1
‘ they ’ve seen me perform against a world - level fighter , standing toe - to - toe , not backing down – and he ’s a super middleweight , i ’m a middleweight			2
‘ fighters have seen that and thought “ maybe i should find somebody else to work with ”			2
@entity19 sparred with @entity7 before his rematch with @entity36 at @entity37 last may ‘ if i find myself in a situation like my last fight where sparring partners are scarce , then i will go over to the @entity51 , because sparring is number one			1
‘ if i do n’t have what i need then i will have to go			0
’ @entity19 lost a split decision to @entity21 in a fight that divided opinion but promoter @entity58 plans to stage a rematch between them in the summer			2
‘ i ’m not using ( a lack of sparring ) as an excuse for the fact i did n’t come away with the decision , because i feel like i performed better than @entity21 did in the fight , ' he said			0
@entity19 will bid to bounce back from defeat to @entity21 against @entity9 in february ‘ with @entity7 ( @entity69 ) , i travelled up to @entity70 , a four - and - a - half hour drive			1
i ’d made the trip because i wanted to test myself			0
‘ unfortunately i guess not everyone in the business has that mindset			0
some guys want easy sparring , they do n’t want their confidence knocked at all			0
‘ a lot of the time , because they do n’t want to spar , the only way for me to spar is to travel across @entity84 to different gyms , in different cities and towns			0
that way they ’ll do it , they feel more at home in their gyms			0
’ @entity94 and @entity95 is live on @entity96 on february 28 .			0
