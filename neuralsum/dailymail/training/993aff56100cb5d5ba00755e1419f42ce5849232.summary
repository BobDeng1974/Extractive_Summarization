by @entity0 last updated at 12:33 am on 15th february 2012 a @entity2 bull that more than lives up to its name has smashed the record for the world 's longest horns			2
seven - year - old @entity7 has horns that measure an incredible 9ft 1ins - and they are likely to grow even bigger			1
he has claimed the @entity26 from a bull in @entity28 called @entity29			0
but whereas that animal had horns that are 88ins long , @entity7 's measure a staggering 109ins from tip - to - tip. @entity7 is descended from pure @entity2 stock			1
his owner @entity35 , 50 , who runs @entity25 with his wife @entity36 , 39 , began breeding @entity14 14 years ago			0
tourist attraction : @entity7 is part of the largest herd of @entity14 in @entity20 , roaming around the 1,100acre @entity25 estate he said : ' i do n't think @entity7 realises how much attention he 's getting now he 's a record breaker			1
' he 's just happy and healthy , we do n't give him any special treatment , we just let him graze around with the kangaroos like the rest of the heard			0
' he 's only seven so he still has a bit of growing to do yet - they can live until their early 20s - his horns could still get bigger			1
' the park opened as a tourist attraction three years ago to allow visitors to take horse - drawn wagon tours to see the @entity14			2
@entity2 : by the time of its first birthday , the horns have grown to about 50 per cent of their total tip - to - tip size @entity14 are bred for their lean meat as well as their striking colour and horns			1
their gentle demeanour means it is extremely rare for a @entity2 to attack a human			0
however , care is required when in their vicinity because of the size of their horns , which they use to scratch their bodies			2
by the time of its first birthday , the horns have grown to about 50 per cent of their total tip - to - tip size			1
this growth reaches 95 per cent between five and six years of age			2
the horns continue to grow but this rapidly slows down as the bull gets older			1
horns grow from the base , resulting in ' growth rings ' that can be seen near the head of older cattle			1
many ranchers sell mounted horns to be hung in homes and public places			2
the horns are an official symbol of @entity92 in @entity14 , while the @entity2 is the @entity93			0
@entity14 are descendants of cattle brought across the @entity96 by the @entity97 in the late 1400s and early 1500s			0
but the gentle , intelligent cattle had actually come from the @entity99 , and before then had originated in @entity100			0
they finally became a registered breed in the @entity15 following the founding of the @entity104 in 1964			0
however , unlike most cattle , nobody set out to develop them as a breed - they had naturally evolved over the course of almost 500 years .			0

seven - year - old @entity7 has horns that measure an incredible 9ft 1in long
given his *youthful* age , they are likely to grow even bigger
