after an assist and a goal for @entity3 against @entity4 on monday night , 21 - year - old @entity0 stepped up in the absence of the injured @entity6 as @entity3 recovered from a poor @entity7			1
here , @entity8 finds out more about the young @entity10 frontman who has been quietly making a name for himself at the mestella			2
so who is @entity3 ’s new striking sensation ? he ’s @entity0 , @entity10 ’s 21 - year - old striker – one start , one assist and one goal are his international stats so far			1
talent : @entity0 ( left ) celebrates his goal with @entity21 during @entity3 's 5 - 1 win against @entity4 name sounds familiar ? top @entity25 clubs have been looking at @entity0 since 2010 when he top scored in the under - 17 euros with six goals for @entity3			1
he was free - scoring 16 - year - old in @entity10 ’s youth academy at the time			1
he got 14 goals in total in that tournament including qualifying			0
@entity34 took a very close look towards the end of last season but @entity10 – a selling club for so long but now under new ownership wanted to hang on to him			0
was his step up to the @entity3 first team predicted ? he got three goals for the under - 19s when they won the @entity44 in @entity45 in 2011 , scoring twice in the final against the @entity47 and a year later he repeated the feat scoring this time in the semi-final against @entity50			1
@entity3 love promoting their under - 21s so with @entity53 retired and neither @entity54 or @entity55 in the sort of form to earn them a recall his chance has come			2
new boy : @entity0 ( right ) could soon find himself in @entity3 's starting line - up more often thank you : @entity0 points to the sky in celebration after volleying @entity3 into a 2 - 0 lead but he has @entity6 ahead of him still ? in theory yes			1
@entity3 coach @entity68 has made costa his own personal project after persuading him to switch from @entity70 to @entity3			0
but many see @entity0 ’s style as better suited to @entity3 ’s short passing game			1
but he is not in @entity6 ’s league ? we ’ll he ’s not even in the @entity76			0
he was farmed out to @entity77 on loan in 2012 and he scored just four goals but still showed enough promise to be recalled and pushed up to the first team at @entity10 last season			2
he repaid that faith with 14 goals and now he is the main man at @entity85			0
he is not at @entity6 ’s level but he is young and having come through the @entity88 national youth system he fits perfectly in the senior side – unlike @entity6 who by his own admission is still adapting			0
filling in : @entity0 could take advantage of @entity6 's stuttering start to life in a @entity3 shirt international : @entity6 has struggled to find form for @entity3 despite a scoring start to life at @entity99 what are his key strengths ? he is a finisher first and foremost			1
quick , strong and clever enough to get in front defenders and get on the end of crosses in the six - yard box			0
likes to finish with a first touch as he did to get the winner against @entity109 at the @entity111 last season but also has the quick feet to make room for himself in the penalty area			0
and he ’s a no 9 ? he ’s technically good with the touch to play with his back to goal and hold the ball up for midfielders but he can also play in wider areas and for @entity3 against @entity4 he spent a lot of time running the left channel leaving @entity21 to appear through the middle			1
could he still finish up in the @entity125 ? his current contract runs out in 2016 and his buy out clause is set at £ 16million			0
another good season and there will be plenty of takers at that price			0
@entity133 striker : the 21 - year - old is now the main man at @entity10 and is contracted until 2016			2

@entity0 scored during @entity3 's 5 - 1 win against @entity4
@entity0 has *attracted* attention from top clubs around @entity25
@entity10 *youngster* has impressed during his time at the @entity143
@entity6 's place in @entity3 's starting line - up could be under threat
