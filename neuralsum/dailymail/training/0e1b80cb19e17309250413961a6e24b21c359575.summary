divers in @entity1 have discovered a rare collection of @entity4 artefacts buried deep beneath the @entity5			1
archaeologists believe the relics were left by @entity1 nomads 11,000 years ago and the discovery may be evidence of one of the oldest settlements ever found in the @entity14 region			1
some of the relics are so well preserved , reports have dubbed the find ' @entity1 ’s @entity17 ' and suggested the settlement may have been swallowed whole by the sea in the same way as the mythical island in the @entity23			1
divers in @entity1 have discovered a rare collection of @entity4 artefacts buried beneath the @entity5 , pictured			1
archaeologists believe the relics were left by @entity1 nomads 11,000 years ago and the discovery may be evidence of one of the oldest settlements ever found in the @entity14 region , dubbed ' @entity1 's @entity17 ' the artefacts were discovered by professor @entity30 from @entity31 , and a team from @entity33 , during an archaeological dive at @entity35 , off the coast of @entity37 in @entity1			1
buried 16 metres below the surface , @entity30 uncovered wood , flint tools , animal horns and ropes			1
among the most notable items found include a harpoon carving made from an animal bone , and the bones of an ancient animal called aurochs			1
aurochs are ancestors of modern - day cattle and lived through @entity52 before becoming extinct in the early 1600s			1
the last reported auroch died in @entity54 in 1627			0
this find is significant because it suggests a date for when these items would have been used			0
many of the artefacts have been preserved because the diving location is rich in a sediment called gyttja			0
@entity17 is the name for the large island or continent said to have been swallowed up by the @entity23 centuries ago			2
tales of the mythical island first appeared in books by @entity68 philosopher @entity67 around @entity69			0
in all of his books , @entity67 used interesting stories to contextualise and explain his ideas about government and philosophy and it is thought the story of @entity17 formed part of this			2
however , this has also lead to claims the stories were made up purely for effect			0
despite this , many maps have previously featured @entity17 , including the @entity84 by @entity85 , 1540 , pictured , that shows @entity86 in red at the bottom , labelled @entity89			2
@entity17 was written about again in 1882 by @entity90 who claimed @entity17 was not only real , but influenced cultures including the @entity92 and @entity93			2
studies of rock found at the bottom of the @entity23 concluded that there has never been a large island buried in the region , and many people now think @entity67 may have got the location of the island wrong			0
other claims suggest the island may have been near modern - day @entity105 , off the coast of @entity68			0
@entity108 , gel - like @entity109 is formed when peat begins to decay			0
as the peat is buried , the amount of oxygen drops and it is thought this lack of oxygen prevented the organic artefacts from being lost			0
@entity30 told @entity117 : ‘ around 11,000 years ago there was a build - up in the area - a lagoon of sorts - and all the tree and bone pieces are preserved in it			1
' if the settlement was on dry land we would only have the stone - based things , nothing organic			2
’ the dive was part of a three - year excavation partially funded by the @entity133			0
archaeologists are continuing the dig , and are now particularly interested to see whether there is also an ancient burial site in the region			2
the artefacts were discovered by professor @entity30 from @entity31 during an archaeological dive at @entity35 , off the coast of @entity37 in @entity1 , marked at @entity142 the dive was part of a three - year excavation partially funded by the @entity133 @entity17 is the name for the large island or continent said to have been swallowed up by the @entity23 centuries ago			1
an artist 's illustration is pictured			0
tales of the mythical island first appeared in books by @entity68 philosopher @entity67 around @entity153 - although the remains of the island have never been found this would add weight to the claims it was once a settlement location that has since been lost at sea			2
if the region was a settlement , it would have similarities with @entity17 - the mythical island first referred to by @entity68 philosopher @entity67			1
@entity17 was said to have been a large island , or even a continent , in the @entity23 that sank and vanished almost overnight			0
however , this underwater civilisation has never been found , and many claim @entity67 either made it up , or the location was not in the @entity23			0
other claims suggest the island may have been near modern - day @entity105 , off the coast of @entity68			0
@entity30 is quick to dismiss the claims the settlement is ‘ @entity1 ’s @entity17 ’ , however , stressing that the @entity1 at the time would have been nomadic			1
this means that the settlement may have only been temporary , and that a village never permanently existed on the site - unlike the mythical @entity17 .			1

divers found a harpoon , tools , horns and the bones of ancient cattle
the bones belonged to the animal auroch last seen in the early 1600s
archaeologists believe these relics date back to the @entity4
it is said to be the oldest settlement in the area - dubbed @entity1 ’s ' @entity17 '
