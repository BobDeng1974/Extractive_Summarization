they are familiar sights around @entity1 and @entity2 but love - locks , inscribed by couples and attached to bridges , are becoming increasingly popular in @entity6 with hundreds taking over @entity8			1
the romantic mementos are increasingly appearing on the 1883 suspension bridge - particularly since @entity11 on tuesday - as couples rush to make a public pledge to one another while taking in the @entity15			1
they are basic , every - day padlocks inscribed or doodled on with dates and initials of the couple , who are then supposed to throw their key in the water as a public statement of their ' everlasting love '			1
a ' love - lock ' hangs on @entity8			2
thousands have appeared on the landmark in recent years growing popularity : individual locks are in place all over @entity8 , left , but the practice is yet to reach the heights of that seen on landmarks in @entity36 and @entity1 , right the practice is popular in @entity38 and has had a boost in recent years from @entity42 's novel @entity40 , which featured a couple doing it in @entity44			1
it seems it started as a spontaneous practice stumbled upon and copied by romantic couples the world over without any idea who did it first			0
but it is now so popular , in some places , tourist stalls are cashing - in selling expensive locks to lovers so they can still make a pledge even if they are ill - prepared			2
also despite it being a seemingly innocent activity , many cities say they have had to stamp it out to protect old structures and stop it multiplying without limits , something @entity6 may have to consider in the future			0
in @entity44 , @entity36 , thousands of locks were removed from the world famous @entity67 as authorities claimed it was damaging the bridge			1
the same was done in @entity71 and to try to reduce the practice in @entity2 a website was established so that couples could just leave a lock ' virtually '			1
romance in @entity77 : hundreds of locks are attached to landmarks in @entity1 as well as cities throughout @entity36 the locks are also found in @entity82 , @entity83 , pictured , across the @entity84 engraved : in @entity8 , left , some locks are engraved while others are daubed in pen , right locked : in @entity38 all sorts of landmarks are targeted , including this statue on the @entity91 in @entity1 in fact @entity36 's capital is one of the most affected cities and in 2007 a lamppost on the @entity97 reportedly collapsed due to the weight of the locks attached to it			1
in @entity6 , the practice is officially against city rules but @entity104 officials appear to turn a blind eye			0
they have previously warned that ' on occasion ' they will remove the locks ' as necessary ' following their inspections , according to the @entity110			0
other cities believe the romantic practice attracts tourists and have even taken steps to promote it			0
in @entity116 in the @entity117 , a sign on the @entity119 reads : ' this is a special place for lovers ! interlock your padlocks on the railings and throw away the key into the @entity126			2
you will never lose your true love ! ' among the recent wave of locks which have appeared on @entity8 the quality of the endeavor varies massively			0
some couples simply pen their names on novelty locks while others take on a more professional approach with fully engraved or painted designs			0
every odd bit of metal which can be found on the bridge appears to have been targeted including metal parts of the structure , benches , and rusting old hooks in the stonework .			0

popular @entity38 practice where a couple inscribe a date and their initials onto a lock and attach it to a bridge is becoming increasingly common in @entity154
the couple throw the key into the water as a ' sign of their everlasting love '
the origin of the practice is *unknown* but has been given a boost after appearing in romantic *fiction* in recent years
in parts of @entity2 , @entity36 , it has been *outlawed* after a large number of locks caused a lamp - post to partially collapse in 2007
