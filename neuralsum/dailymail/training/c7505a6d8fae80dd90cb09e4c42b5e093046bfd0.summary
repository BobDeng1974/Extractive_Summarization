published : 05:09 est , 7 may 2013 updated : 05:36 est , 7 may 2013 a new study has discovered that women ’s brains are hard - wired to respond to a baby ’s cry , while men do not seem to react at all			1
@entity8 , carried out by @entity6 in the @entity7 , asked 18 men and women to let their minds wander			1
during this time the scientists conducted brain scans			0
oblivious : brain scans have shown that men 's brains do not react in the same way as women to the sound of a distressed baby the researchers then played a recording of white noise interspersed with short clips of a baby crying			1
the scans showed that while women immediately became more alert after hearing a baby ’s cry , the brains of men remained in a resting state			2
specifically , the dorsal medial prefrontal and posterior cingulate areas , known to be involved when the mind is allowed to wander , were recorded by functional magnetic resonance imaging ( @entity36 ) and later studied for results			0
' determining whether these responses differ between men and women , by age , and by parental status , helps us understand instincts for caring for the very young , ’ study co-author @entity38 the @entity39 told @entity46			2
although brain activity patterns differed between men and women , there was no difference in the brain patterns between parents and non-parents			0
the researchers also played the cries of infants who were later diagnosed with autism			0
interestingly , the study found that both men and women reacted to autistic babies			1
previous studies have shown that babies with the condition have higher - pitched cries interestingly , hearing these cries interrupted the mind wandering of both men and women			1
a previous study has shown that the screams of infants who develop autism tend to be higher pitched than those of other babies and that the pauses between cries are shorter			1
it has been long known that women 's bodies react to the sound of babies after pregnancy			2
soon after birth , a woman 's ' letdown reflex ' — the reflex that releases the milk produced by breasts — needs time to adjust to the sensation of feeding			0
frequent breastfeeding will help the reflex become attuned to particular stimulation , but until then , many sensations such as hearing screams and even certain thoughts may trigger lactation ( the release of milk from the breast ) .			0

@entity7 study shows that men 's brains are not *designed* to respond to the sounds of a baby crying
however both men and women react to cries of autistic babies because they are higher pitched
