@entity1 's injury - prone midfielder @entity0 played 90 minutes for @entity2 as they continued their strong start to the season at @entity5 , thanks to two goals from @entity8			1
@entity0 , who has been plagued with injuries over the past four years , was playing his second game for the academy side this season at an empty @entity5 , with just 377 fans in attendance			0
the @entity15 midfielder was strong and composed in the centre of the park , and showed occasional signs of his undoubted quality by threading sumptuous through - balls between the heart of the @entity23 defence			1
by that stage @entity8 had already capitalised on some calamitous defending by @entity23 captain @entity39 to put @entity1 1 - 0 up with a composed finish			2
and the striker , who broke the @entity1 record for the 10m sprint last week , doubled his tally late on , showing strength to match his speed as he held off a defender before finishing calmly with a flick of his right boot			0
@entity8 was one of several @entity1 youngsters who will hope @entity51 was watching their impressive displays on thursday night			2
@entity8 toes home his second goal despite being off - balance as @entity1 won at @entity5 @entity55 hurdles a challenge as @entity1 made it three wins and a draw from four games this season @entity61 ( left ) and @entity62 ( right ) were both solid at the back as they await first - team opportunities @entity61 and @entity62 will both expect a chance in the first team this season with @entity51 so light on defenders , while @entity70 once again showed why he is rated so highly at the @entity71			1
but it will have been the performance of @entity0 that most pleased @entity51			0
he managed just one @entity74 appearance last season , a 15 - minute run out in may against @entity31 , but if he can keep fit , he can provide the steel in @entity1 's light - weight midfield .			0

@entity8 scores twice as @entity1 continue *unbeaten* start
@entity0 looks fit and strong as he continues injury *comeback*
@entity15 midfielder plays a few glorious full - backs in attempt to prove he is ready for first - team *football* again
