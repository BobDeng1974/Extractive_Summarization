' it was like a torpedo shot and it had some weight behind it , hitting through the waves			0
' nothing in @entity1 could create a disturbance like that , apart from @entity18			2
i just sat there in amazement			0
' it was the moment i had always been waiting for , and i am kicking myself for not taking a photo			0
since then , i have been by the loch with my camera poised every day , come rain or shine			2

' i have been here for more than 20 years now , and this is my way of life			0
' he also dismissed suggestions that the monster might be nothing more than a myth , saying : ' the loch is such a huge and mysterious body of water , containing more fresh water than the lakes of @entity134 and @entity135 combined , so it is the perfect place for a unknown sea creature to dwell			0
' the legend of the @entity18 has been around since the sixth century , when an @entity139 monk called @entity140 witnessed locals burying a man who had been attacked by a ' water beast			0
