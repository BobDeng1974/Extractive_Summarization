football fans are rallying behind a football player who was resigned to his team after being cut so he could keep his health insurance and pay for his four - year - old daughter 's cancer treatments			1
defensive tackle @entity6 , 25 , was cut from the roster of the @entity8 two weeks ago , but the team did bring him on to the practice squad instead , meaning he would still get paid and receive his health insurance			1
and now , fans are showing their support in a very big way , by making his football jersey the fastest - selling in team history			1
it 's not just fans either , as even competing teams are showing their support by snapping up some of their rival 's shirts , with the @entity8 thanking the @entity40 for buying 100 jerseys earlier this week			1
the support from the @entity8 - which included allowing still to miss last sunday 's game in @entity44 - comes after he was out of six games last season for injuries to his elbow and back			2
speaking with @entity50 , he explained : ' they said if i keep working on my physical ... and mentally prepared myself to focus on football then they can move me back up to the roster so i am not all the way out of the loop ... just them sticking by me through this whole time , they understand exactly what i am going through			0
it is a blessing i am on this organization			0
' the move means that he will receive a weekly salary of $ 6,300 , will have to travel less , and get to spend more time with @entity69 , who is being treated in @entity70			0
brave little girl : @entity73 ( above ) has stage 4 pediatric cancer ever since @entity69 's diagnosis , still has shared images on @entity76 showing her dancing in the hospital and grinning as she headed back for her fourth round of chemotherapy a few weeks ago			0
the proud father , who is engaged , has also shaved his head in support of his daughter , who has lost her hair to her treatment			0
still 's daughter has @entity89 pediatric cancer .			2

@entity6 , 25 , of the @entity8 , was resigned after being cut to pay for his four - year - old daughter 's cancer treatments
now fans and even rival teams have shown their support for the defensive tackle by buying his jersey , which is now the fastest - selling in team history
the @entity8 are *donating* all proceeds from the sale of @entity6 's jersey to pediatric cancer research
