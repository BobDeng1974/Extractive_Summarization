towering over rural @entity1 , passing motorists could be forgiven for screaming for help from the doctor			1
a huge 35ft @entity4 has appeared in a field next to the @entity6 , seemingly intent on world domination			1
but even though its fearsome plunger looks set to exterminate , the people of @entity9 can sleep soundly in their beds instead of hiding behind the sofa			0
a dalek made out of straw is dominating fields in rural @entity1 , if not taking over the world as the greatest enemy in @entity18 may like to do staff at @entity21 ice cream shop near @entity9 create a large straw sculpture every year and chose to mark the show 's 50th anniversary for 2013 's offering the cyborg is made out of six tons of straw and five tons of steel and is the latest offering from staff at a nearby ice cream parlour			1
each year , the team at @entity32 , @entity33 , celebrates the summer with a new straw sculpture which is usually related to something newsworthy at the time			1
this year , they 're marking the 50th anniversary of @entity40 favourite @entity18 - and the most - feared of the doctor 's many enemies will even come to life and move , awakening childhood memories for many			1
the series itself will mark the occasion with a special edition of the show in november before the eleventh doctor @entity50 leaves the programme at the end of the year			2
celebrations have already begun in @entity1 , where the sculpture is expected to draw in visitors until the end of the year and will even be decorated for @entity56			1
some of the company 's @entity58 fans speculated that this year 's creation would mark the birth of the @entity62 and @entity62 of @entity64 's child , @entity65			2
but devoted @entity66 had other ideas			0
@entity68 of @entity21 said : ' we were absolutely inundated with @entity18 suggestions from customers coming into the shop and emailing and writing on @entity58			2
it has taken two days to get the @entity4 to its full height , with straw stuffed into a steel structure before being moved into place by a crane the body of the @entity4 takes shape , helped by a team of 13 to get it to its full 35ft height ' we just thought : a dalek in that field would look amazing			0
' the annual event started in 1998 when staff built a huge @entity90 sculpture from hay			0
since then , they 've taken on the @entity92 , @entity93 , the @entity94 and the @entity95 at the nearby @entity96 , among others			0
last year they celebrated last year 's @entity99 and @entity101 games with a cyclist racing around a straw velodrome			2
this year , engineer @entity104 , 54 , decided to go one better than previous years and animate the giant model			0
he designed the sculpture with @entity21 director @entity107 , 60 , and then worked out how to make it bit more like its television counterpart			2
the head of the @entity4 , seen being lifted into place , will move around once the sculpture and its electronics are completed today the eye of the @entity4 will light up and possibly scare a few @entity66 who come to see the 35ft sculpture for themselves thanks to mr @entity104 , the @entity4 's eye will light up and its head and plunger will move			0
the familiar cry of ' exterminate ! ' will also ring out across the fields			0
@entity121 will also sell a da - lick ice cream cone in the parlour to raise money for charity			1
a percentage of the cone 's sales will be donated to @entity129 to support a member of the dairy 's staff whose father is undergoing cancer treatment			0
in 2004 , the @entity21 team created their own @entity94 out of straw - and even gave it a cone the following year , the @entity92 relocated to @entity1 for the summer , becoming a straw @entity138 in 2009 , @entity93 spent the parliamentary summer break as ' @entity140 ' , which at 70ft was a quarter of the size of the real thing in 2010 , a 36ft meerkat , made popular that year by an insurance company 's adverts , watched over drivers			1
