by @entity0 published : 01:47 est , 29 october 2013 updated : 01:54 est , 29 october 2013 art - lovers will be able to see two of the most recognisable and much - loved paintings in the world at a museum in @entity6 for the first time in 65 years			1
the @entity8 will reunite two of @entity11 's iconic ‘ @entity12 ’ paintings next year , allowing visitors the chance to compare and contrast these much - loved masterpieces side - by - side			1
the historical exhibition , which will also showcase new research about the way the artist worked , was made possible thanks to a deal with the @entity23 in @entity24			0
two versions of @entity11 ’s iconic ' @entity12 ' are being reunited in @entity6 for the first time in 65 years in 2014 the paintings are two of the five versions of ‘ sunflowers ’ that are now spread around the world , with the others currently residing in @entity34 , @entity35 and @entity36			1
they are worth an estimated £ 100m each and were last exhibited in @entity6 together 65 years ago			1
the series dates from 1888 , when @entity11 left @entity39 to paint in the brilliant sunshine of the @entity41 , inviting @entity42 to join him			2
he completed the five sunflower paintings in autumn 1888 waiting for @entity42 to arrive , @entity11 painted a series of pictures of sunflowers to decorate his friend ’s bedroom			1
they were meant as a sign of friendship and welcome , but also of @entity11 's allegiance to @entity42 as his artistic leader			2
@entity11 wrote to his brother @entity56 in august 1888 : ' i am hard at it , painting with the enthusiasm of a @entity61 eating bouillabaisse , which wo n't surprise you when you know that what i ’m at is the painting of some sunflowers			2
' if i carry out this idea there will be a dozen panels			0
so the whole thing will be a symphony in blue and yellow			0
' i am working at it every morning from sunrise on , for the flowers fade so quickly			0
i am now on the fourth picture of sunflowers			0
' this fourth one is a bunch of 14 flowers ... it gives a singular effect			0
' the pair worked together throughout autumn 1888 – but it ended very badly at the close of the year when @entity11 seemed to have a nervous breakdown , famously cut off part of his ear and entered an asylum			1
@entity8 director , dr @entity88 , said : ' this exhibition is designed to help those for whom the paintings by @entity11 are compelling images to understand how they were made – and made again – and out of what materials			1
' it will deepen every visitor ’s appreciation of the artist			0
we are very grateful to the @entity23 for making this possible			0

@entity103 artist 's 1888 pictures will be reunited for first time in over six decades
the £ 100m paintings will be exhibited at @entity8 next year
@entity11 *created* them in *frenzy* of *activity* *shortly* before breakdown
