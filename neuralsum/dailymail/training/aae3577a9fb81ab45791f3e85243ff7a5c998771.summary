by @entity1 reporter published : 10:21 est , 11 july 2012 updated : 02:02 est , 12 july 2012 new warning signs have been erected around @entity3 to stop prostitutes and drug addicts using the grounds			1
cathedral bosses in @entity8 , @entity9 have finally run out of patience with prostitutes using the building 's grounds as an open air brothel			1
diocesan authorities are threatening to remove the vice girls who use the alcoves and churchyard of the @entity20 cathedral to ply their seedy trade , as well as drunks and drug addicts who desecrate the grounds			1
they have spent £ 1,000 on more than a dozen signs erected on lampposts around the churchyard warning potential wrong - doers that the site is a ' sacred ancient burial ground			1
' they fear the ‘ disgraceful behaviour ’ will deter people from enjoying the calm and tranquility of the surroundings			0
the cathedral 's canon @entity37 has complained of having to move unconscious drunks from a bench when he arrives in the morning and of dirty needles and other drug paraphernalia being found in the churchyard			1
he said clergy and other staff have also been threatened by drunks and anti-social youths when asked to move on - as well as muggings in the grounds , with police being called to deal with several incidents			0
@entity52 , who is in operational charge of the cathedral , said : ' things are getting worse but that is a reflection of society at large			0
' we decided we had to replace the existing signs with new tougher ones in view of what has been happening			2
' after warning potential offenders that ' cctv cameras operate in this area , ' the new signs say the cathedral ' reserves the right to ask people who are treating these grounds disrespectfully to leave			2
' @entity71 @entity37 is fed up with prostitutes and drug addicts using the @entity3 's grounds			1
the warning notices erected around the cathedral 's grounds also say no litter , ball games , shouting or swearing , alcohol , drugs or bicycles will be allowed			2
@entity52 said : ' the cathedral surrounds are an ancient burial ground and deserve to be treated with respect			1
' we do not have a problem with young people coming and using the cathedral grounds to sit , talk and even have a cigarette			0
' but we do not want people playing ball games , shouting and swearing in the grounds			0
this is not what they are here for			0
' people should not be treating the many previous residents of @entity8 buried here with disrespect			0
' he said problems had escalated in recent months with drunks coming into the grounds leaving bottles and cans around and increasing amounts of anti-social behaviour ' with broken bottles , dirty needles and drug paraphernalia left around			1
' ' there is a real problem with people dropping and leaving litter , ' he said			0
' it takes our gardeners an hour every morning to clear the grounds and obviously broken bottles and dirty needles are a health hazard			2
“ if people ignore the signs they will be asked to leave the grounds by clergy , vergers , and other staff			2
if they refuse , the police will be called to remove them			0
