by @entity0 flies appear to ' think ' before they act , and - like humans - they take longer to make trickier decisions , a study has found			1
scientists admitted to being surprised by the discovery , which indicates that even insects show signs of intelligence			0
gathering information before deciding on a course of action was previously thought to be the preserve of only highly evolved species , such as monkeys and humans			0
scientists have shown that flies ' think before they act '			0
the research was carried out by tasking flies with picking between two similar odours , and it was found they thought longer when the decision was harder			1
here is shown one of the fruit flies in one of the chambers in a series of tests , the researchers asked fruit flies to distinguish between ever closer concentrations of an odour they were trained to avoid			1
when the concentrations were very different and easy to tell apart , the flies acted quickly to move to the end of a chamber furthest away from the strongest smell			0
but when they were very close and difficult to distinguish , the flies took much longer to make a decision , and made more mistakes			2
instead of responding impulsively , they seemed to accumulate information , weighing up what their smell sense was telling them before committing to a choice			0
professor @entity49 , from @entity51 ’s @entity50 , said : ' freedom of action from automatic impulses is considered a hallmark of cognition or intelligence			2
' what our findings show is that fruit flies have a surprising mental capacity that has previously been unrecognised			1
' the researchers , whose findings appear in the journal @entity65 , showed that a gene called @entity67 was involved in the decision - making process in the fly ’s brain			1
the gene was active in a small set of around 200 nerve cells			0
lead author dr @entity74 , also from @entity51 , said : ' before a decision is made , brain circuits collect information like a bucket collects water			2
' once the accumulated information has risen to a certain level , the decision is triggered			0
' when @entity67 is defective , either the flow of information into the bucket is reduced to a trickle , or the bucket has sprung a leak			2
' flies with a mutation in @entity67 took longer than normal flies to make decisions when odours were difficult to distinguish			1
like a human paralysed by a difficult choice , they became indecisive			0
mathematical models developed to describe the mechanisms of decision - making in humans and other primates matched the behaviour seen in the fruit flies , the scientists found			1
fruit flies have one @entity67 gene , while humans have four related @entity67 genes			1
@entity106 and @entity107 have previously been associated with language and mental development			0
the genes are also linked to the ability to learn fine sequential movements , such as playing the piano			1
flies with a mutation in their one @entity67 gene , which is linked with the ability to learn fine sequential movements such as playing the piano ( stock image pictured ) , took longer than normal to make decisions when they were presented with odours that were difficult to distinguish ' we do n’t know why this gene pops up in such diverse mental processes as language , decision - making and motor learning , ' professor @entity121 said			1
' one feature common to all of these processes is that they unfold over time			0
' @entity67 may be important for wiring the capacity to produce and process temporal sequences in the brain			2
' he added : ' @entity67 is not a " language gene " , a " decision - making gene " , even a " temporal - processing " or " intelligence gene "			1
' any such description would in all likelihood be wrong			0
' what @entity67 does give us is a tool to understand the brain circuits involved in these processes			2
' it has already led us to a site in the brain that is important in decision - making			0

researchers tasked fruit flies with discerning between similar odours
and the study at @entity51 found them to be indecisive
when faced with a tough decision they took longer to deliberate , like us
the research shows a gene called @entity67 is *responsible* for decision making
this gene is also linked to fine movements like playing the piano
