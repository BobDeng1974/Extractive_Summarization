there 's a print of a monkey ’s head on @entity5 ’s cycling helmet but , after gorging himself on gold , the @entity6 would be perfectly entitled to consider a portrait of something faster			1
@entity5 and pilot @entity11 combine the darting speed of a gazelle with the brute strength of a big cat and , against even their own expectations , pooled their resources to dig out their second gold of these games in the @entity21			1
known as the ‘ @entity23 ’ for his perky persona and physical fortitude , there ’s no aping around when @entity5 climbs on his bike			2
the partially - sighted cyclist is already a @entity30 and @entity31 champion and now he and @entity32 can call themselves double @entity35 champions and @entity37 ’s first multiple gold winners of 2014			1
pride : @entity5 and pilot @entity11 celebrate after winning the tandem final on saturday this latest success was hardearned and somewhat unexpected			1
@entity5 , 30 , tweeted before the final that the odds were against the @entity37 and he looked worryingly correct after the first leg of the final against @entity46 @entity45 and @entity47			1
‘ the morning session was such a struggle for us , we were just so fatigued from yesterday , ’ said @entity5 as he soaked up the acclaim of the crowd in the sir @entity50			1
‘ qualifying did n’t go that well and i felt absolutely awful after it			2
we got through the semi-final and it was a real effort			2
the @entity46 were flying , they killed us in qualifying , and i knew they had a lot they could use against us			2
‘ they are such a talented team and i knew it was going to be a struggle			2
the first ride proved that and i have no idea where we found what we did at the end			2
‘ it just comes down to the crowd			2
without them i doubt we ’d have done it			0
’ after friday ’s heroics in the 1,000 metres time trial , @entity5 was not alone in fearing there would be a toll on the duo ’s legs , and the suspicion lingered when they qualified for the final slower than @entity45 and @entity47			0
beaten a little too comfortably in that first race of the final , gold looked a forlorn hope until a heroically strong finish in the second left them with a shot in the decider			0
who knows what alchemy occurs when the roar of an expectant home crowd transfuses energy into an athlete ’s legs but by the end of the decider they had streaked ahead to a rapturous reception			0
shots fired : @entity5 points out to the vociferous @entity103 crowd following the win sir @entity50 was in the commentary gantry to see his former team - mate @entity11 claim another medal but it was to his family that the 42 - year - old made a beeline at the end			1
‘ at the @entity114 i was in deep trouble for not going up to the stands and saying hello to my family , ’ he revealed			0
‘ i have kids here now , and it ’s very special having them in the crowd			0
it was extra special to do it front of a predominantly @entity37 audience			1
it ’s not often you get to do that and it means a lot as potentially it ’s the last time i will do this in my career			0
‘ i am not retiring just yet but i am not going to see another @entity35 , certainly not in @entity37			1
’ the night before @entity133 provided the celebrity support and this time there was royalty in attendance in the form of @entity139			0
still , @entity5 hopes his achievements reach a wider audience than the 4,000 or so in attendance			0
comeback : the @entity37 pair had to come from 1 - 0 down in the best - of - three final to win ‘ you do n’t really consider yourself inspirational but it is nice when people come up to you , ’ he added			1
‘ there are so many people with visual impairments in @entity37 and the @entity152 and the sad thing is we only have two @entity152 bikes here and there is not even an @entity158 tandem			1
‘ there are so many people who could be taking up the opportunity and if anyone is inspired by me to do that then i am happy			0
’ earlier , there was disappointment for @entity167 who was tipped for a medal in the 10km scratch race , but finished fifth as @entity46 ’s @entity170 took gold			0
@entity172 will go again in the 25km points race , her favoured event			0
‘ i guess i was in a prime position at the end and it just did n’t happen , ’ reflected the 20 - year - old @entity176 columnist			1
‘ the scratch race is such a short event that you ’ve really only got one chance at it , whereas the points race i feel it ’s always the strongest rider who comes out on top			0

sir @entity50 *salutes* @entity37 winners for second day running
@entity11 *competed* with @entity191 at @entity192
they came from 1 - 0 down to win 3 - 0 before a *lap* of *honour* with a @entity198
