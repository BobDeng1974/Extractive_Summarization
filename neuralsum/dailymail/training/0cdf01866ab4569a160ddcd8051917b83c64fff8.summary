@entity0 and @entity1 each paid £ 16million for a striker with something of a point to prove in the closing stages of the transfer window			1
@entity7 arrived in north @entity8 with a reputation for hard work , level temperament , a little skill , pace , power , and questionable finishing			1
@entity16 landed on @entity17 with a reputation for not much hard work , erratic temperament , a lot of skill , pace , power and cool finishing , at least from the penalty spot			1
@entity16 had a night to forget for @entity1 while @entity7 scored a hat - trick for @entity0 but already , with wednesday night ’s @entity30 action as @entity31 , the evidence suggests it is @entity32 with the bargain on his hands , while @entity35 perhaps has only trouble , greater even than he anticipated			1
@entity32 had the opportunity to buy @entity16 but declined , while @entity35 had earlier in the summer dismissed the idea totally			1
circumstances changed and he must now get the best out of the @entity41			0
@entity7 , meanwhile , has quickly shown he could be better than many thought possible			1
juxtaposing the abilities of the two players born just three months apart shows why			0
@entity7 , congratulated by @entity45 following his goal , looks to have settled in quickly at @entity0 @entity16 goes to ground on a frustrating evening as @entity1 lost 1 - 0 to @entity47 in the @entity30 work rate this is the defining quality that separates @entity7 from @entity16			1
too often a backhanded compliment for players not as talented as others , it is actually the difference between winning and losing			0
@entity7 will run all match for his team , while @entity16 often looks like he ’s not overly keen to stride a few yards			1
at @entity59 , that willingness meant @entity7 would be asked to play on the wing rather than up front			1
with a finish reminiscent of @entity0 legend @entity64 , @entity7 's three strikes gave @entity0 a 4 - 1 victory @entity7 worked tirelessly for the @entity0 cause and created countless problems for the @entity69 backline it is also why sir @entity71 gave @entity7 the job of @entity73 , under instruction to target and tackle @entity75 , when @entity76 visited @entity77 in march 2013			1
can you imagine @entity35 requesting a similar , thankless task of @entity16 ? it would be harder than convincing @entity81 to take a role as a supporting actor in a blockbuster film			2
@entity35 could not even persuade @entity16 to applaud travelling @entity1 fans following defeat in @entity47			1
@entity16 looks down following a disappointing night for @entity1 in @entity87 @entity16 failed to register a single touch in the opposition 's box as @entity1 failed to score in @entity87 finishing following @entity7 ’s first goal for @entity0 against @entity92 , @entity32 explained his belief that an instinct for finishing had ebbed during years spent on the edge of stage at @entity59			1
when every shot is scrutinised because of their infrequency , confidence can sap			0
this is not to absolve @entity7 for misses – indeed his attempted dink when through against @entity105 last season stands out as a particularly galling episode – but it goes some way to contextualising 20 goals in 92 @entity110 for @entity59 ( 39 appearances were from the bench )			2
as he showed in his hat - trick against @entity69 , @entity7 actually possesses the tools to score plenty			1
his first for @entity59 , as a 17 - year - old , was a thunderbolt from range , while the ' @entity119 ' for @entity120 against @entity121 at @entity122 expressed ingenuity			0
@entity124 - 4 minutes on pitch - 310 goals - 0 mins per goal - n / a shots on target - 5 shots off target - 8 shooting accuracy - 38 % chance conversion - 0 % blocked shots - 7 goal assists - 0 chances created ( incl			1
assists ) - 3 mins per chance created - 103 @entity133 passes - 74 pass completion - 74 % dribbles and runs - 7 dribble completion - 29 % stats courtesy of @entity138 @entity124 - 3 minutes on pitch - 256 goals - 1 mins per goal - 256 shots on target - 5 shots off target - 4 shooting accuracy - 56 % chance conversion - 11 % blocked shots - 4 goal assists - 1 chances created ( incl			1
assists ) - 3 mins per chance created - 85 @entity133 passes - 77 pass completion - 86 % dribbles and runs - 6 dribble completion - 67 % stats courtesy of @entity138 @entity16 has never suffered from a shortage of bravado			1
sorting his famous ‘ why always me ? ’ t - shirt ahead of the @entity155 derby shows as much			0
his finishing has mostly backed that statement up			0
from 12 yards he is pretty much invincible – recent lapses in @entity41 failing to puncture his perfect record in @entity120 – and there is no doubt he possesses the mentality of a goalscorer			0
he makes the difficult look simple , as with his only @entity1 goal to date against @entity166 , and has a knack for finding the extremities between the posts			2
his record for @entity171 of 20 @entity110 goals in 33 starts bears scrutiny with the best			0
@entity7 prods the ball past @entity177 goalkeeper @entity176 to open the scoring for @entity0 @entity16 shoots at goal but the assistant referee is quick to signal for offside to deny the @entity1 striker attitude a tale of two mindsets			1
where @entity7 is the ultimate team player , @entity16 is the ultimate maverick			1
moves will often link through @entity7 , who set up @entity189 in the win at @entity191 , and he showed his willingness to run beyond the shoulder of the last defender against @entity69			1
he may want that centre - forward role dearly , but his time at @entity59 shows he will not shun an order to sacrifice himself for the greater good			0
sacrifice is the word @entity202 columnist @entity201 could not countenance when discussing @entity16			2
his psychology is attuned to individual glory , as much as he may be a likeable figure in the dressing room			0
given the lone forward role in @entity47 , he regularly dropped deep in search of the ball when he would have been better suited providing an outlet further up			2
there was not a single touch in the opposition box , but two cracked free - kicks from distance – admittedly very good – and a shot slashed horribly wide when team - mates offered better choices			0
@entity7 screams with joy as he celebrates scoring the goal which gave him his first ever hat - trick @entity16 endured a miserable night up front for @entity1 and regularly dropped deep in search of the ball @entity224 this is an area @entity16 should excel over @entity7 but any footballer schooled in @entity59 ’s academy since the age of 11 will have a sure touch			1
@entity7 can dribble and perform a drag back as well as anyone in the division			2
@entity16 holds all the tricks in his locker but utilising them for best impact is a talent he is yet to master			2
just remember that @entity238 turn when through on goal in a pre-season friendly for @entity171			0
@entity241 hooked him straight away			0
@entity7 dribbles past @entity69 's makeshift centre back @entity243 and marauds forward with the ball @entity16 has plenty of tricks in his locker but the @entity41 has failed to truly master and utilise his talents fans rating @entity0 supporters were initially uncertain about @entity7 , even if they did delight in capturing a player @entity59 ’s faithful had called their own			1
that @entity253 were gazumped also added to his allure			0
but any doubts are beginning to be dispelled and virals celebrating @entity7 have flooded social media , ever the gauge of a footballer ’s popularity			2
@entity1 followers will always want to unite behind their players and even though @entity16 was once a thorn in their side , hundreds of fans flocked to the club ’s @entity267 training base the night he conducted his medical , cheering as he left past 9pm			1
that initial excitement has turned into realisation that he is not the @entity271 , however , just @entity16 ( and sometimes he can be a very naughty boy )			2
@entity7 has dispelled any doubts @entity0 fans once had while @entity1 supporters may be realising @entity16 is not the @entity271 they had been hoping for when the frontman arrived from @entity276 competition for places so far @entity7 has enjoyed the run of the @entity280 with @entity281 injured			1
it will be interesting to witness his reaction , and @entity32 ’s , when the @entity285 striker returns from his foot problem in january			0
he might have sealed his starting role as centre forward by then if he carries on like he is			0
@entity289 can play up front but is out of favour , while @entity292 is another who wants to play striker but is currently injured			0
finally @entity7 is the main man in possession of the shirt			2
it is a similar situation for @entity16 at current			2
@entity298 has been superb since arriving from @entity299 in january 2013 but has a frustrating habit for getting injured			0
he has been out with a thigh strain since the start of september			0
once fit , he could force @entity16 to the bench , with @entity304 and @entity305 for support instead			0
@entity307 and @entity308 are @entity35 ’ other striking options but neither is setting the world alight at @entity311			0
@entity307 has n’t scored in five substitute appearances in the @entity110 , while @entity313 has managed to stick around despite everyone ’s best efforts to get him to @entity316			0
he did score 10 times on loan on @entity319 last season but only twice for @entity1 the campaign before .			0

@entity16 and @entity7 both moved for £ 16million
@entity16 has had a disappointing start to his @entity1 career
@entity7 , however , has impressed after signing for @entity0
@entity1 lost 1 - 0 against @entity47 with *misfiring* @entity16 up front while @entity0 beat @entity69 4 - 1 courtesy of @entity7 hat - trick
