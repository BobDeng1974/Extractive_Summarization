by @entity0 follow @ @ oliver_todd when it comes to the @entity3 , @entity1 is @entity4 's main man			1
his record of nine goals in nine matches coming from just 10 shots on target coming into the game with @entity11 is astounding			0
and put simply : if @entity1 is on form , @entity4 win			2
his five goals in @entity15 in 2010 made him the tournament 's top goalscorer - and @entity4 might have had a shot at winning that tournament if it was n't for his suspension in the semi final against @entity21			2
23 minutes : @entity1 turns creator , slipping a ball out to @entity44 but the @entity47 man 's indecisiveness leads to him losing the ball			1
35 minutes : @entity1 drifts a glancing header wide of the goal			0
37 minutes : @entity4 's top goalscorer has a bit of a nightmare : he gets on the end of @entity44 's parried shot but in an entirely out of character moment he hesitates , takes a bad touch and the ball runs out of play			1
48 minutes : the @entity62 winner tees up substitute @entity63 with a cute layoff but @entity4 still fail to score			1
50 minutes : @entity1 makes a claim for a penalty after some grappling in the @entity11 box but the referee waves away his appeal			2
80 minutes : @entity1 forces a great save from @entity70 with a diving header that the ' keeper beats away for a @entity74 corner			0
81 minutes : after sidestepping a defender he toe - pokes wide to waste the best chance of the half			0
87 minutes : @entity1 slips just before running up to a free kick - potentially deliberately - as part of a bizarre @entity74 set piece that ends in nothing			1
92 minutes : he turns provider , playing a low ball across the box and a couple of deflections allow @entity63 to get on the end of it and score			1
117 minutes : @entity1 rounds the ' keeper but ca n't find the net in the closing minutes			0
and while @entity11 were taking advantage of @entity95 's side 's shaky defence - the @entity74 ' real problem was @entity1			1
he has been in fine form for @entity4 at this @entity3 but on monday night his performance was not that of the clinical international goalscorer we have seen so often at this level			0
instead , @entity1 looked laboured , easy to mark and amazingly for him : hesitant			0
a poor performance was summed up by his bizarre ' pretend - slip ' free kick routine which ended with him alone in the penalty area but without the ball			1
@entity1 ran towards the ball but fell just before the ball , jumped up , hopped over it and ran into the box			2
@entity29 looked to find him but @entity1 was in a terrible position			0
earlier , in the first half when he found himself on the end of @entity70 's parry from @entity44 's shot			2
where you would usually except this @entity62 winner to pull the trigger and smash home the rebound , he instead stopped to think for a second			0
in that moment , the chance was gone - @entity1 waited too long and ended up foolishly kicking the ball out of play			1
it was an embarrassing error , and the @entity74 gave him few better chances to make an impact			0
later , he missed the game 's two best chances so far in the space of nine minutes , firing a powerful header at @entity70 and then poking a shot wide from close range after rounding a defender			0
it has been an obvious trend at this @entity3			0
@entity4 looked great in their opener against @entity135 with @entity1 on song , poor against @entity137 when @entity139 's cameo saved them , and alright against the @entity141 when @entity1 scored again			1
reflecting on his successful tournament in 2010 , @entity1 said : ' i basically got lucky , i hit form at just the right time , ' and in @entity146 he has again mainly showed that good form			0
unfortunately for him , and @entity4 , that did not show against the plucky @entity40			2
luckily though , @entity63 was there to pick up the pieces - although @entity1 did put in the heavily deflected cross			1
are we seriously doing this lads ? the @entity74 chat about their dodgy training ground free kick routine almost : @entity1 looks on as @entity70 saves his shot towards the end of the game hero : eventually it was @entity63 who was left to make the difference in extra time @entity163 @entity74 survive @entity11 scare thwarted : @entity11 produced some brilliant defensive play to try to keep @entity1 quiet tough break : the 2010 @entity62 winner constantly had defenders around him from early on @entity169 : the @entity40 defence kept a close watch on @entity1 as he looked to extend his goal record glum : @entity1 , sporting his scar from earlier in the tournament , looks on wistfully after a missed chance @entity177 : @entity178			1

*embarassing* free kick routine summed up his evening
@entity1 *struggled* and wasted his only chance in the first half
*striker* *uncharacteristically* hesitated when receiving ball in the box
the @entity40 defence gave him little room to express himself
and @entity4 's *midfield* offered him few chances to thrive on
@entity63 and @entity44 score for @entity4 in 2 - 1 extra time *victory*
