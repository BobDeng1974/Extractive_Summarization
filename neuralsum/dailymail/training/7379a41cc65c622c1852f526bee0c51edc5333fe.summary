the book , which had sold only 1,500 copies and was languishing at 4,709 in @entity46 ’s bestsellers list immediately shot to the top of the chart			0
it led to claims that the revelation had been a marketing ploy to boost interest in the @entity55 ’s calling , which tells the story of @entity12 , a war veteran turned private eye , who is investigating the death of a model			2
a publisher admitted earlier this week she turned down the @entity55 ’s calling after finding it ' perfectly decent but quiet '			0
@entity61 , fiction editor at @entity62 , said she could n't see a @entity63 for the crime novel , submitted to her by ' first - time author @entity12 ' , in a ' tough ' market			2
unluckily for her it turns out there was one , and now sales of the book , which had had a lukewarm reception originally , are soaring			0
the book , which had sold a modest 1,500 copies and was languishing at 4,709 in @entity46 's bestsellers list until last week , shot up 5,000 places to the top of the chart after its true author was revealed			1
confessing that she wrote the book , published three months ago , miss @entity1 said : ‘ i had hoped to keep this secret a little longer because being @entity12 has been such a liberating experience			1
‘ it has been wonderful to publish without hype or expectation , and pure pleasure to get feedback under a different name			0
’ miss @entity1 ’s publishers have now reprinted 140,000 copies of her crime debut to meet demand			2
but she has spent the last four days trying to discover how her secret had been passed to @entity39 , a woman she has never met			0
now the legal firm , @entity20 , has apologised ‘ unreservedly ’ after one of its partners , @entity93 , was identified as the source of the leak			1

miss @entity1 said in a statement : ‘ i have today discovered how the leak about @entity12 ’s true identity occurred			1
‘ a tiny number of people knew my pseudonym and it has not been pleasant to wonder for days how a woman whom i had never heard of prior to sunday night could have found out something that many of my oldest friends did not know			1
‘ to say that i am disappointed is an understatement			0
i had assumed that i could expect total confidentiality from @entity20 , a reputable professional firm , and i feel very angry that my trust turned out to be misplaced			2
’ the @entity115 law firm said in a statement : ‘ we , @entity117 , apologise unreservedly for the disclosure caused by one of our partners , @entity93 , in revealing to his wife ’s best friend , @entity123 , during a private conversation that the true identity of @entity12 was in fact @entity1			1
‘ whilst accepting his own culpability , the disclosure was made in confidence to someone he trusted implicitly			0
‘ on becoming aware of the circumstances , we immediately notified @entity1 ’s agent			0
‘ we can confirm that this leak was not part of any marketing plan and that neither @entity1 , her agent nor publishers were in any way involved			0
’ the publisher of @entity12 had claimed it was written by a former plain clothes @entity143 investigator using the pen - name of @entity12			2
but literary sleuths would have noticed that the ‘ novice ’ writer shared an agent with miss @entity1			2
and the novel was published by @entity150 , part of publisher @entity152 , which released miss @entity1 ’s first book for adults , @entity153 , last year			0
readers had noted on social networking sites how well the ‘ male ’ author had described women ’s clothes			0
a worker packs finished copies of the @entity55 's calling onto a shipping pallet today the @entity55 ’s @entity12 had received rave reviews , with @entity164 , author of @entity165 , saying it reminded her ‘ why i fell in love with crime writing in the first place ’			1
miss @entity1 had said it had been ‘ wonderful ’ to publish for once without hype or expectation and to get feedback under a different name even if that meant some publishers rejected her work			0
last night there was no answer from the intercom at mrs @entity39 ’s large detached home in @entity180 , @entity181			0
mr @entity93 was not available for comment			0
miss @entity1 has hinted that a sequel will appear to the crime novel she wrote as @entity12			1

’ and despite her anger she has even signed ‘ a few copies ’ of her detective novel as ‘ @entity12 ’ , according to her publicist @entity188			2
when she began publishing her @entity10 novels @entity191 decided to use her initials rather than her first name , @entity195 , because she feared that boys would not want to read a book by a woman author .			1
