by @entity0 published : 11:06 est , 15 january 2013 updated : 14:16 est , 15 january 2013 a @entity2 man grew tired of his parrot ’s constant squeeks for attention , so built him a robot car to shut him up			1
@entity8 , a 29 - year - old computer engineering student , build the small electric buggy for @entity10 so he could entertain himself and quiet down			1
after trying different solutions to the @entity13 - related noise issue , including a sound activated water gun and a remote controlled drum , he came up with the beak - operated car			1
the first solution , a noise - activated water gun intended to deter the bird from making noise had a completely different result			2
' eventually it became a bird bath , and @entity13 would start making noise just to get sprayed , ’ he told @entity36			0
after another failed invention , the drum , which did everything but deter @entity13 , he built the @entity40			2
they see me rollin : @entity13 controls the car with a four - way joystick using his beak they hatin ' : the car is equipped with sensors and an infrared camera to help @entity13 drive safely ‘ i realized the bird needed to be around people constantly			1
he just needed to be in the same room			0
’ @entity13 operates the @entity40 himself , steering a joystick in four directions with his beak			2
the buggy has an infra - red camera as well as bumper sensors so @entity13 can safely steer around the house without crashing into walls			0
top speed : now that he is busy enjoying his new ride , @entity13 is a lot quieter ‘ he knows how to drive , forwards , backwards , left and right			0
’ mr @entity8 told @entity36			1
‘ he loves his new toy			0
’ a video of @entity13 and his ride has become a @entity70 favourite with 800,000 views in just over a month			0
although the new quiet version of @entity13 is a blessing to the whole family , mr @entity8 hopes that the publicity of his invention may lead him to a job .			1
