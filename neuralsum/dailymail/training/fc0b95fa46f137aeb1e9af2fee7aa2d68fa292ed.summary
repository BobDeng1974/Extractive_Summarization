@entity1 boss @entity0 has told @entity3 counterpart @entity2 it would be dangerous to write off the @entity6 men			1
the @entity8 rivals will both go into the hat for saturday 's @entity11 semi-final draw - raising the prospect of a first @entity14 derby since the @entity15 were liquidated in the summer of 2012			1
@entity0 has already admitted he would take ' anyone but @entity3 ' as he looks to steer @entity1 to their first major final under his management			1
@entity1 boss @entity0 says the @entity19 champions @entity3 should n't underestimate his side but he stressed @entity2 was wrong on thursday to suggest @entity1 are weaker than @entity23 outfits @entity21 and @entity24 , the other teams through to the last four			1
the @entity26 boss claimed the ' best teams are in the top division ' , but @entity0 chose to politely disagree with the @entity30 's assessment			1
he said : ' @entity2 is entitled to his opinion and maybe it makes sense because we are the only team from outside the top division			0
i can understand @entity2 's logic , yeah			0
' i do n't think it 's unfair but then i do n't necessarily agree with it			0
i can understand where he is coming from			0
in most cases you would think a team from a lower division that is left in a competition with three teams from the league above is the weaker side			1
' @entity2 would be 100 per cent right in his beliefs if it was a normal playing field			0
but i do n't think anyone can argue that in recent years , @entity54 football has been anything but a normal playing field			0
' we have got three of the top five clubs in the country playing in the division below the top flight			0
@entity3 boss @entity2 has overseen a disappointing start to the season ' so that does n't make it a normal playing field			1
' rangers have knocked out top - flight opposition twice on their way to the semi-finals			2
@entity73 - last year 's finalists - were beaten 1 - 0 at @entity6 last month , before the @entity75 champions repeated that scoreline when they saw off @entity79 winners @entity77 on tuesday			2
@entity0 says that is the basis of his confidence			1
' @entity3 are favourites , ' said the @entity6 boss			1
' surely everybody will accept that ? i think we are the outsiders along with @entity21 and @entity24			0
' that 's not mind games , it 's the definite opinion of football fans			0
' but we fancy our chances			0
i believe @entity21 and @entity24 are two of the better sides in the country on their day but we have proved this year that against teams from the top flight , we can handle the occasion and we now look forward to the draw			1
' striker @entity100 also believes @entity1 can make @entity2 eat his words			1
the former @entity3 frontman said : ' it 's a game i never thought i would get to play in again , so whether it be in a semi or a final , it would be one i 'd look forward to			1
' let 's be honest , they would go in as favourites			0
they are the reigning champions of the @entity19 , playing at the higher level , but we would go in confident , as we do with every game			0
@entity100 thinks @entity1 could spring a surprise if they are paired against their arch - rivals in the @entity11 ' we are in the @entity115 , we are the lowest - ranked team , so [ what @entity2 said ] makes sense a little bit			1
but only time will tell who the strongest is and who the weakest is			2
' rangers return to @entity122 on saturday for a @entity79 third - round tie just a week after beating them 3 - 0 at the @entity124 on league duty			2
but once again the build - up to the match has been overshadowed by events in the @entity6 boardroom			1
@entity130 has tightened his grip on the club after the @entity135 owner 's Â£ 2million loan was accepted			0
the terms allow @entity130 to put two of his own men on the board , while two of his close allies - @entity140 and @entity142 - have been hired as consultants			2
non-executive chairman @entity144 has assumed executive responsibility for the time being as he leads the search for a new chief executive following @entity150 's resignation			2
but @entity0 said he had still to hear from @entity130 's people directly			1
' i would n't expect to [ speak to @entity130 or his people ] but i 'm obviously available to speak to any board members or shareholders should they want to , ' @entity0 said			2
' i do have dialogue with the chairman			0
i spoke to him on monday and then yesterday again			0
he 's keeping me up to speed on what the board are doing and that is fine			0

@entity1 and @entity3 are in the hat for the @entity11 semi-final draw
a *potential* match - up could see the two teams meet for the first time since @entity1 entered liquidation in june 2012
@entity0 says @entity3 would be *foolish* to underestimate his side
