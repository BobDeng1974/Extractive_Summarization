the oldest known shell to have been engraved by an early human has been uncovered in a @entity3 museum collection , where it remained unnoticed since the 1930s			0
the ancient mollusc , originally discovered on the island of @entity8 , is between 430,000 and 540,000 - years - old , dating to the time homo erectus inhabited the remote volcanic outpost			1
the engravings resemble the previously oldest - known etchings , which were created by either @entity13 or modern humans around 100,000 years ago			1
the oldest known shell ( top ) to have been engraved by an early human has been uncovered in a @entity3 museum collection , where it remained unnoticed since the 1930s			0
pictured here is its polished edge ( bottom ) the shell has a polished edge and a zigzag pattern of engravings , suggesting it was used from cutting or scraping			1
if this is the case , it means our ancestors , @entity9 , were more intelligent than we thought			2
the successful , long - lived species emerged out of @entity34 almost two million years ago , and were possibly the first early humans to live in hunter - gather societies they also used rafts to travel the oceans			2
' it rewrites human history , ' dr @entity39 , a @entity40 paleoanthropologist who made the find , told @entity44			0
' it 's evidence that @entity9 exploited these aquatic food resources , and fits with other evidence that they probably foraged in and around water			2
' @entity52 engravings are considered to be a sign of modern cognitive abilities , but the origins of such behaviour have been debated			1
the latest analysis of freshwater mollusc shell collected from the @entity60 fossil site on @entity8 in the 1890s imply @entity9 was also capable of ' modern ' behaviour			1
the shell has a polished edge and a zigzag pattern of engravings ( shown ) , suggesting it was used from cutting or scraping			1
it may mean our ancestors , @entity9 , were more intelligent than we thought @entity52 engravings are considered to be a sign of modern cognitive abilities , but the origins of such behaviour have been debated			1
' it rewrites human history , ' said dr @entity39 , a paleoanthropologist at the @entity40 the team found that @entity9 were able to open the shells by drilling a hole through the shell with a shark 's tooth			1
this damaged the muscles causing the valves of the shell to open , so that the contents can be eaten			0
dr @entity83 , of @entity84 in @entity3 , said : ' the manufacture of geometric engravings is generally interpreted as indicative of modern cognition and behaviour			1
' @entity89 questions in the debate on the origin of such behaviour are whether this innovation is restricted to @entity94 and whether it has a uniquely @entity34 origin			0
' here we report on a fossil freshwater shell assemblage from the main bone layer of @entity60 - the type locality of @entity9 discovered by @entity100 in 1891			1
the engravings inside @entity102 in @entity103 are the first known examples of @entity13 rock art it may look like a cross , but lines scratched into a cave wall could be proof that @entity13 were more intelligent and creative than previously thought			0
the cross-hatched engravings inside @entity102 in @entity103 are the first known examples of @entity13 rock art. the find is significant because it indicates that modern humans and their extinct cousins shared the capacity for abstract expression , according to a team of scientists who studied the site			2
experts examined and described the grooves in a rock that had been covered with sediment in the study published in the @entity125 journal			0
archaeologists had previously found artefacts associated with @entity13 culture laid over the top of the artwork , suggesting that the engravings must be older , said professor @entity132 , director of heritage at the @entity134			2
' the production of purposely made painted or engraved designs on cave walls is recognised as a major cognitive step in human evolution - considered exclusive to modern humans , he said			0
the latest analysis of the freshwater mollusc shell ( shown ) collected from the @entity60 fossil site on @entity8 in the 1890s imply @entity9 was also capable of ' modern ' behaviour ' in the @entity100 collection in the @entity148 in @entity149 we found evidence for freshwater shellfish consumption by hominins , one unambiguous shell tool and a shell with a geometric engraving			1
' together our data indicate the engraving was made by @entity9 and it is considerably older than the oldest geometric engravings described so far			2
' although it is at present not possible to assess the function or meaning of the engraved shell this discovery suggests that engraving abstract patterns was in the realm of @entity167 cognition and neuromotor control			0
' the ability to make and use tools dates back millions of years			0
chimpanzees - our closest living relatives - can devise spear - like weapons for hunting and create specialised tool kits for foraging ants			0
this suggests our family tree could have possessed wooden tools since the ancestors of humans and chimps diverged some four million years ago			0
the team found that @entity9 ( artist 's impression pictured ) were able to open the shells by drilling a hole through the shell with a shark 's tooth the shell was originally found in @entity8 , an island in @entity193			1
today it has a population of 143 million			0

@entity197 , found in @entity8 , is between 430,000 and 540,000 - years old
@entity199 has a polished edge as well as a zigzag pattern of grooves
this suggests it was used as an ancient tool for cutting and scrapping
earliest previously known engravings are at least *300,000* years *younger*
find implies that @entity9 was also capable of ' modern ' behaviour
