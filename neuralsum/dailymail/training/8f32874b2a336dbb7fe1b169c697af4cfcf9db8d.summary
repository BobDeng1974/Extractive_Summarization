@entity0 has given a damming verdict of the @entity2 and described @entity4 's last two titles as ' absurd '			1
but the @entity6 icon is not dismayed at the @entity9 attacker 's victories because of his affiliation with @entity11 , as @entity0 is adamant @entity4 's club team - mate @entity12 should have taken the award			1
the 67 - year - old hailed @entity12 ' achievements with @entity16 in 2013 , where @entity18 's side cruised to league victory by 25 points , before lauding him for his attacking displays at the @entity23 in @entity24 , a tournament he said @entity4 was ' invisible ' in			1
@entity4 should not have won the @entity2 , according to @entity0 @entity0 believes that @entity12 was a much better candidate to take the award @entity12 poses with the @entity23 he helped @entity27 to win in @entity24 in 2014 ' at the highest level , it 's a combination of individual talent and titles , ' @entity0 told @entity33 newspaper @entity32			1
' from this point of view , it is absurd that , for the second consecutive year , the prize has been given to a player who has not played excellently [ at a major tournament ] or won the most titles			0
' in 2013 , @entity16 won everything there was to win , and yet @entity4 won the award instead of @entity12 or any other @entity16 player			2
' in 2014 , @entity12 was again decisive in the team that won the @entity23 , and yet he was not in the three finalists			0
@entity4 was invisible in the @entity23			0
' i just can not take this @entity49 award seriously			0
' @entity12 , who moved to @entity11 after his @entity23 triumph , was named in the @entity51 alongside @entity11 team - mates @entity4 and @entity53			2
@entity12 ( right ) poses with his @entity11 counterparts after being named in the @entity51 @entity0 won the @entity2 three times himself in 1971 , 73 and 74			0
despite @entity4 continuing his relentless scoring record and won the @entity57 , the @entity33 believes these feats are not as significant as @entity12 ' impact at the @entity23			1
@entity12 shone in all seven appearances in the tournament for @entity27 and scored twice in the 7 - 1 semi-final victory over hosts @entity24 .			0

@entity33 *legend* @entity0 says he ' can not this @entity49 award seriously '
he believes that @entity12 should have won the award at least once
@entity0 feels @entity4 's @entity23 *performance* should have ruled him out
