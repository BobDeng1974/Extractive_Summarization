the chancellor used this week 's budget to announce the first above - inflation increase in the threshold for the higher rate of tax @entity6 is expected to pledge to accelerate increases in the 40p income tax threshold if the @entity9 win the general election			1
the chancellor used this week 's budget to announce the first above - inflation increase in the threshold for the higher rate of tax , which has sucked in ever - more middle - class families , in seven years			1
but yesterday economists said that even after the latest rise , the decision to limit increases had left millions out of pocket			1
the @entity22 ( @entity22 ) said higher - rate taxpayers will be £ 535 worse off in 2017 - 18 than they would have been had the threshold risen in line with inflation since 2010			2
those earning up to £ 100,000 have benefited from repeated increases in the 20p threshold , but not as much as the 26million basic - rate taxpayers			2
mr @entity6 persuaded reluctant @entity32 colleagues to agree that the higher - rate tax threshold should rise gradually from £ 41,865 this year to £ 43,300 in april 2017 as he sought to woo voters ahead of may 's election			1
he is now expected to use the @entity9 election campaign to say he would go faster if the party wins outright			0
the chancellor says he wants to deliver a threshold of £ 50,000 for higher - rate tax and £ 12,500 for the basic rate			1
the @entity22 said yesterday that higher - rate taxpayers were feeling the pain from the @entity45 's earlier decisions to cut the threshold for paying 40p and then increasing it by less than inflation			1
the think - tank said the threshold would need to rise to £ 48,650 by 2017 to ensure that higher - rate taxpayers had not lost out since 2010			2
@entity52 , a senior research economist at the @entity22 , said : ' higher - rate taxpayers will be £ 535 worse off because the point at which you start paying 40p income tax has been reduced in real terms significantly over this @entity58			2
' but he said basic - rate taxpayers will be £ 597 a year better off by 2017 - 18 because of increases in the personal allowance – the point at which income tax of 20 per cent kicks in			0
mr @entity6 says he wants to deliver a threshold of £ 50,000 for higher - rate tax and £ 12,500 for the basic rate the @entity45 has already raised the personal allowance from about £ 6,500 to £ 10,000 and it is due to hit £ 11,000 in 2017			1
mr @entity6 said the planned increases in the 40p threshold in the coming years – which could be reversed by an incoming @entity74 government – were a modest ' downpayment ' on @entity75 plans to raise the threshold to £ 50,000 by 2020			1
@entity77 vowed last year to end the scandal of so - called ' fiscal drag ' , which has seen millions of people dragged into higher rates of income tax by below - inflation increases to thresholds			2
the number of people paying 40p tax has risen from around three million to five million since 2010 and is due to keep rising			0
the @entity22 , the leading independent expert on tax and spending issues in @entity91 , has estimated that one in four taxpayers could be hit over the coming decade			0
but it has warned that such a large increase in the threshold ' might be politically difficult for a government to go ahead with ' given the likely backlash among voters			0
the @entity75 have so far refused to say exactly where the money will come from to fund an increase in the 40p threshold to £ 50,000 by 2020			0
the policy has been opposed by @entity74 and the @entity32			0
critics called on all political parties to raise the threshold at which the 40p tax rate kicks in			0
one leading tax adviser said the 40p rate of income tax ' was not intended to be a tax on people who you would hardly say are earning a fortune ' .			0
