by @entity0 with his forked tongue , razor - sharp fangs and horns that poke from his forehead , @entity5 , 43 , from @entity6 , looks like most people 's idea of a terrifying demon			1
now the former security guard and self - described ' body modification artist ' is to have screws implanted into his skull in a bid to create a devilish metal mohawk			1
but because ' body modification ' is unlicensed and unregulated in the @entity20 , the entire operation will be done without anaesthetic			1
' you see the needle coming towards you and that 's really stressful			2
you ca n't be scared of pain if you 're the @entity41			2
' among the operations that @entity5 - real name @entity43 - has so far endured are having his tongue sliced in two to fork it , sub-dermal implants to create a set of horns and an eyeball tattoo that has turned the whites of his eyes bright red			1
but despite the pain , the 43 - year - old insists he has no plans to stop			2
' i describe myself as a body modification artist , ' he explains			1
' i am a human curiosity but body modification is my life 's journey			1
it 's a little bit weird , a little bit eccentric but that 's what i am			2
' he adds : ' i chose to become the @entity41 because everything else has been done , whether here or in @entity68			0
i 'm not satanic at all - it 's just a piece of fun			0
' it 's certainly an expensive piece of fun , with @entity5 confessing to spending more than £ 10,000 on his transformation so far			1
' over the years , it 's probably cost me £ 10,000 to look like this , ' he explains			1
' being a @entity41 does n't come cheap ! ' it has n't been cheap for the taxpayer either : in 2009 , @entity5 was caught swindling £ 3,552 by making a series of fraudulent benefit claims and was sentenced to 200 hours of community service			1
speaking outside court after the trial , the divorced father - of - two said : ' i was really constrained by money and i just wanted to have these modifications done so i used my benefit money to pay for some of them			0
' it was a stupid mistake and i 'm really sorry			0
i 'm paying it all back			0
' he added : ' but i 'm pleased with my look so far , but what i really want is a tail			0
and not just a synthetic one - a proper , organic tail			0
' inspiration : lucifer as portrayed by @entity103 engraver @entity101 in a plate from @entity105 while @entity5 is yet to realise his ambition of getting an organic tail , he has since had his ears made pointy and endured a series of painful tattoos that now cover his face and arms			1
although @entity5 says he 's happy with his unusual looks , he does admit that looking like @entity25 has made his quest to find a girlfriend fraught with pitfalls			1
' relationships is a bit of a difficult issue to be honest , ' he confesses			0
' i 'm looking for someone who can see beyond the mask			0
' it has changed the way people look at me , accept and deal with me			0
it has made certain aspects like relationships difficult but it is my life journey and i ai n't stopping ! ' i do get a lot of attention from people walking down the street and i do have fun with it			0
some people are scared and some do n't understand but it is just a bit of fun			0
i 'm not satanic at all , it 's purely an image thing ! @entity5 appears on @entity147 and @entity148 and i want more , tonight at 9pm on @entity149			2
