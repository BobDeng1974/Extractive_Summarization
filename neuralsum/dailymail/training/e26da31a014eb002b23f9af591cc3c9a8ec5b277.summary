earlier this week , astronauts on board the @entity2 embarked on the first @entity4 spacewalk since april to move a broken pump			1
and during the three - hour event - which was broadcast live online - astronaut @entity6 took time out to take a stellar selfie			1
the @entity11 flight engineer used a digital camera to take the photo on his helmet visor , in which , the reflection of the sun and parts of the space station are visible			2
say cheese ! during a three - hour spacewalk to move a broken pump outside the @entity2 , astronaut @entity6 took time out to take a stellar selfie ( pictured )			1
the @entity11 flight engineer used a digital camera to take the photo on his helmet visor , in which , the reflection of the sun and parts of the space station are visible @entity4 - based spacewalks were curtailed in july 2013 after @entity31 astronaut @entity30 nearly drowned because of a flooded helmet			1
@entity33 solved the problem with the suit 's water - cooling system , but then concern arose over spacesuit batteries			1
new batteries arrived late last month , clearing the way for tuesday 's spacewalk , and another one scheduled for next week			1
on tuesday , @entity4 astronaut @entity43 and @entity44 mr @entity6 worked together to move a broken pump into its proper storage location			1
the pump had been been outside the station since december			2
on tuesday , @entity4 astronaut @entity43 and @entity44 mr @entity6 ( pictured ) worked together to move a broken pump into its proper storage location			1
during the six - hour , 13 - minute spacewalk , mr @entity6 and mr @entity43 worked outside the space station 's quest airlock @entity4 - based spacewalks were curtailed in july 2013 after @entity31 astronaut @entity30 nearly drowned because of a flooded helmet			1

his vine reads : ' turns out a sphere of floating water makes the ultimate fisheye lens ' during the three - hour , 13 - minute spacewalk , mr @entity6 and mr @entity43 worked outside the space station 's quest airlock			1
they relocated the failed cooling pump to external stowage before installing gear that provides back - up power to external robotics equipment			2
the 780lb ( 350kg ) pump on the move was about the size of a double - door refrigerator			1
this is another angle of @entity6 taking a selfie			2
the camera is in front of him and below you can see the swirling clouds over @entity84 below this was the first spacewalk ever for mr @entity43 and mr @entity6 , and the former ’s exuberance was evident as he emerged from the hatch into the vast darkness over the @entity91 ( pictured )			1
‘ wow , looks like we 've almost got a full moon out here			0
it 's beautiful , ’ he said construction of the @entity2 began on 20 november 1998			0
it supports a crew of up to six , with crews split into groups of three			0
the station orbits at a height of about 264 miles ( 425 kilometres )			0
it has a total mass of about 990,000 pounds ( 450,000 kilograms ) and has liveable space roughly equivalent to a five - bedroom house			0
it completes an orbit of @entity84 every 92.91 minutes and moves at 17,100 miles ( 27,600 kilometres ) per hour			0
it has now been in space for more than 5,800 days , during which time it has completed more than 88,000 orbits of @entity84 , and has been continuously occupied for over 13 years			0
it ended up in temporary storage during urgent spacewalking repairs to the station 's ammonia - cooling system last december			2
@entity33 did not want to waste time back then putting the pump in the correct long - term location , given all the spacesuit worries			2
this was the first spacewalk ever for mr @entity43 and mr @entity6 , and the former ’s exuberance was evident as he emerged from the hatch into the vast darkness over the @entity91			1
‘ wow , looks like we 've almost got a full moon out here			0
it 's beautiful , ’ he said			0
when the glow of sunrise started to appear several minutes later , he shared his excitement again with @entity131			0
a follow - up spacewalk is scheduled for 15 october to further whittle down @entity33 ’s lengthy to - do list , on hold since the 2013 incident			2
that spacewalk will be conducted by mr @entity43 and fellow @entity4 @entity137 , a newcomer			1
a week after that , two of the three @entity140 on board will perform a spacewalk on their country 's side of the orbiting outpost			2
the @entity148 - led spacewalks were unaffected by @entity33 's spacesuit troubles			1
the helmets used by mr @entity43 and mr @entity6 ( pictured ) for tuesday 's spacewalk contained absorbent pads and makeshift snorkels in case of water leakage in july 2013 , @entity33 was forced to dramatically abandon a spacewalk on the @entity2 after a dangerous water leak in an astronaut 's helmet drenched his eyes , nose and mouth			1
@entity31 's first spacewalker , @entity30 , endured the terrifying experience when his drink bag tipped half a liter of floating liquid around his face			2
@entity30 could not speak or hear his radio due to the water , and he got wedged outside the craft before being helped in by fellow astronauts			2

here , @entity6 tests his spacesuit on the @entity2 in preparation for the walk the pump could not be moved until now owing to spacesuit troubles			1
in july last year , @entity31 astronaut @entity30 almost drowned when his helmet filled with water following a coolant fault			1
and later a battery malfunction left astronauts unable to go out the station			1

mr @entity43 and mr @entity6 moved a refrigerator - sized pump ( pictured ) left outside the station in december the leak was so bad that @entity30 asked his spacewalking partner , @entity4 @entity200 , to help him back in			1
' it 's a lot of water , ' the @entity31 said once he was back in the air lock of the station			2
he later recalled that he thought he was going to drown during the ordeal			0

' we ’re inspired that we live in an era where consumer technology now allows us to do things that were only exclusively available to professionals just a few years ago , ' said mr @entity227 , who founded the @entity242 ( @entity242 ) collective			0
' @entity245 amateur astronomers can now download this design and software , 3d print and assemble their own hardware , which is an amazing development			0
it opens up opportunities for people who have been gazing at the stars their whole lives , but have n’t , until now , been able to get involved			0
' powered by @entity224 smartphones , our hope is that hundreds of @entity257 will be assembled , enabling a large number of people to contribute to new discoveries as they explore the night sky			0
' the @entity221 is currently in @entity264 testing and @entity229 plans will be downloadable from the @entity242 website			0
over the next 12 - 18 months increasingly sophisticated models will be released , enabling enthusiasts to peer ever deeper into the stars			0
the @entity270 team is currently working on an application which will enable the @entity224 to be connected with the telescope			0
the pump could not be moved until this week owing to spacesuit troubles			1
