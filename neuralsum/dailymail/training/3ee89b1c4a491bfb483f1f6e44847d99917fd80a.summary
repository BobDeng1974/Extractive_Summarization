@entity0 and @entity1 have invited the @entity2 to join an alliance of ‘ like - minded ’ nations to limit action on climate change			1
the two countries have each rolled back green policies in recent months , and want others to join them to resist a legally - binding international deal on carbon emissions			0
@entity13 , @entity0 ’s prime minister , called for limited action on climate change that would not ‘ clobber the economy ’			1
he is seeking to form a conservative alliance that aims to undermine what he calls a ‘ left - liberal ’ push by @entity22 president @entity21 to ramp up green taxes			0
the @entity35 last night distanced itself from the @entity1 - @entity0 alliance , insisting it had not been approached and was , in fact , ‘ leading from the front ’ on climate change			1
mr @entity13 , standing alongside the @entity1 leader during a visit to @entity29 , said : ‘ we think that climate change is a significant problem , it ’s not the only or even the most important problem the world faces but it is a significant problem and it ’s important every country should take the action that it thinks is best to address emissions			1
’ he said no country would ever take action that would harm its economy , adding ‘ we are just a bit more frank about that than other countries ’			0
‘ it ’s not that we do n’t seek to deal with climate change , ’ he said			2
‘ we seek to deal with it in a way that enhances our ability to create jobs and growth , this is their position			0
’ he said efforts are underway to form a new ‘ centre - right ’ alliance including @entity2 , as well as @entity68 and @entity69			0
climate change is due to move up the political agenda in the coming months , with a @entity73 summit on climate action planned for september , to be hosted by @entity75 ban ki - moon			1
it will lay the groundwork for a legally - binding global deal on reducing greenhouse gas emissions , to be agreed in @entity80 in december 2015			0
mr @entity21 , who sees strong action to stop climate change as a legacy issue as his presidency draws to a close , last week announced plans to cut pollution from power plants by 30 per cent by 2030			2
the @entity35 , meanwhile , has gathered an anti-green reputation in recent months , after @entity90 reportedly told his officials to get rid of the ‘ green c * * p , his party promised to cap the number of onshore wind turbines , and officials slashed subsidies for large solar farms			0
@entity2 has gained an reputation for anti-green rhetoric after @entity90 reportedly told his officials to ditch the ' green c * * p ' but officials last night insisted the @entity2 was not aware of the anti-climate grouping and had not been approached about joining			0
a spokesman for the @entity106 said : ‘ the @entity2 government remains fully committed to domestic and international actions to curb climate change , and will continue to advocate strong actions through the @entity73 process and other international forums , working with our inter-national partners			1
‘ the @entity2 is leading from the front in the fight against climate change			2
‘ we are pushing for an ambitious @entity120 energy and climate change package that will lead to a 40 per cent domestic reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 , and we are also working to secure an ambitious legally binding global climate agreement in @entity80 in 2015			2
’ @entity125 , policy at the @entity127 on @entity128 , said : ‘ this looks like a desperate move by @entity13 who must be beginning to realise how isolated @entity0 and @entity1 are as @entity132 , the @entity22 , @entity133 and the rest of the world move towards stronger action on climate change			1
‘ the @entity0 and @entity1 governments , through their backsliding on commitments to cut green - house gas emissions , are making their countries synonymous with old and dirty methods of energy production , frantically trying to resist progress towards clean and more efficient sources			0
‘ i doubt very much that mr @entity90 or any other world leader will join prime minister @entity13 and prime minister @entity30 in what is , in effect , the slow lane , where their countries will be eventually overtaken by those that are making the transition to clean and sustainable economic growth			2
