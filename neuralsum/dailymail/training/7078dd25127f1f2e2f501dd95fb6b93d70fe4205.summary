by @entity0 published : 07:00 est , 13 june 2012 updated : 08:01 est , 13 june 2012 a six - year - old boy with a fear of loud noises ' died ' for more than half an hour after a ' petrifying ' thunderstorm triggered a heart attack			1
@entity6 had just been picked up from school when his heart suddenly stopped as he was sitting his mother 's car , leaving him ' dead ' for 33 minutes			1
his lips and face even started turning purple as his body was deprived of oxygen			2
doctors believe the attack was caused by a sudden adrenaline rush brought on by fear of the noise of the thunder and hail			1
@entity6 , 6 , was ' dead ' for 33 minutes after suffering a heart attack , but is now making a good recovery his mother performed life - saving cpr before he was taken to hospital			1
he was put into a medically induced coma to help his body recover , and for a while doctors feared he may have been permanently brain - damaged			1
he is now home , but needs round - the - clock supervision in case he suffers a similar episode			2
medics have compared his near - death experience to that of @entity38 footballer @entity37 , who collapsed on the pitch during an @entity41 quarter - final against @entity42 in march			2
@entity37 suffered a cardiac arrest and his heart stopped beating naturally for 78 minutes			1
@entity6 's mother @entity45 , 41 , from @entity46 , @entity47 , said the youngster had been in good health but had always been afraid of loud noises and was ' petrified ' on may 15 , when she picked him up from @entity51 in @entity46 , during a thunderstorm			1
the mother - of - three said : ' he 's always been quite scared of anything loud			2
at family weddings we have to give him ear plugs and he hates anything like drilling or even rain coming down on the conservatory roof			2
' that day i picked him up , he was absolutely petrified			2
there was hail , lightning and thunder , so i ran across the playground to get him into the car as quick as i could			2
' but when we got there , he was absolutely panicked			0
he kept saying , " where 's my seat ? " , because i had moved it to the front of the car			2
' i dashed to get it and when i got to the back of the car again , he was slumped over			0
' in my mind , i thought he was just messing about and i was getting quite annoyed with him			0
i just picked him up to put him in the seat , but my daughter @entity81 screamed , " no mum , he 's ill "			1
' i looked at him and could see he was n't breathing and was turning blue			0
' slow recovery : @entity6 was in an induced coma , before slowly getting back to normal following his heart attack thanks sis : @entity6 pictured with his older sister @entity81 , 18 , who helped perform cpr on the youngster mrs @entity90 , who is a trained lifeguard , began cardio - pulmonary resuscitation ( @entity88 ) from the back of her @entity94 car , while her 18 - year - old daughter called 999			1
' it had been years since i had done any cpr training but it all came flooding back to me , ' said mrs @entity90 , who is married to maintenance engineer @entity99 , 40			0
' the staff in the ambulance control room were amazing , talking me through every step			0
but @entity6 ’s lips and face started to turn purple and i became hysterical			1
' mrs @entity90 recalled how the 15 minutes passing between calling the ambulance and @entity6 arriving at hospital " felt like hours "			1
she said at one point , daughter @entity81 , who had no first aid training , had to take over the cpr with control room staff directing her what to do			0
she added : ' alot of people have said to me they would n't have been able to do what i did , but i just went into auto - pilot			0
i knew he needed me			0
' @entity6 was whisked to @entity118 , where staff continued to battle to save his life			1
' i was in a side room with a nurse who was trying to calm me down , but i was in bits , i kept asking if he was going to die , ' added mrs @entity90			0
' i was convinced i was going to lose him , but then they managed to start his heart beating again			2
i was told his heart had stopped beating for 33 minutes , i could n’t believe it			1
' cardiac arrhythmias , or disruptions to the heart working properly , are a common cause of this syndrome			2
sometimes there are no warning signs , but in other cases people can experience dizziness , fainting or fainting spells			0
sudden loss of consciousness or death often occurs during physical exercise or emotional upset			0
research has indicated that about 500 deaths a year in the @entity148 are because of sudden arrhythmic death syndrome , but it is very rare in children			0
inheritance may be a factor			0
the family was told the devastating news that @entity6 would have to be induced into a coma as his body had suffered such a horrific ordeal			1
' they said he may never come out of the coma , or even if he did there was a good chance he could have suffered serious brain damage , ' said mrs @entity90			2
' i was absolutely distraught , but when they told me he could be brain damaged i thought , i 'll accept that - as long as he pulls through that 's all that matters			2
' a day later doctors stopped the medication to bring @entity6 out of the coma - leaving his parents in an agonising waiting game to see if he would wake up			1
' i sat next to him holding his hand and talking to him softly , telling him it was time to wake up now as he had been asleep for too long , ' added mrs @entity90 ' i said " come on sleepy head ... if you wake up we can all go to @entity178 "			0
' the mention of @entity180 seemed to do the trick and @entity6 slowly opened his eyes			1
' when he squeezed my hand i broke down in tears , ' she added			0
' we were asking him questions and he would blink responses			0
everyone was amazed that he was alert and seemed to understand what was going on			0
' however , after becoming violently sick and struggling to breathe on his own due to fluid on his lungs , staff put the youngster back into a coma in a bid to give his body a rest from the trauma			1
' it was the longest five days of my life , ' said mrs @entity90			2
' but even though he was so ill , had an overwhelming feeling he would be alright			0
' mrs @entity90 said her husband @entity99 , ' went to pieces ' during their son 's hospital stay , while older brother @entity208 , 15 , could not bare to return to the family home where he shared a bedroom with @entity6 and instead stayed with his grandparents			1
six days after the heart attack , @entity6 was once again brought out of his drug - induced coma - and the family were at last ' overjoyed ' to hear him speak his first words			1
mrs @entity90 said : ' he whispered that he wanted to go home , ' she said			0
' those were the best words i have ever heard			0
' medics have compared @entity6 's experience to that of @entity38 footballer @entity37 , who collapsed on the pitch during a game against @entity42 in march back home at last : @entity6 was all smiles when he finally left hospital and returned home with his mother @entity45 @entity6 spent a total 17 days in hospital			1
each of his classmates sent him a get well card and picture , and his teachers visited him on the ward			0
mrs @entity90 said his recovery has been a ' miracle ' , but tests have so far failed to show why @entity6 , who regularly plays football and swims , would have suffered a heart attack			1
his consultant , dr @entity242 , at @entity118 , believes he may have cheated the condition , @entity243			0
he also believes that @entity6 became so distressed by the loud thunderstorm , that his body was overwhelmed by a huge rush of adrenaline , and this may have triggered the attack			1
@entity6 is now due to return to hospital on friday , after doctors " spotted something of interest " on his mri scan			1
mrs @entity90 added that no - one else in the family had suffered a similar event , but after @entity6 's heart attack , she discovered that her uncle had also suffered heart attacks as a child			1
@entity262 , who also lives in @entity46 , is now well and aged 71			0
now back at home , mrs @entity90 has been forced to quit her part - time job as a receptionist to home school @entity6 as medics have told her he must be with someone with cpr training around - the - clock			1
the family have now set up a charity , @entity272 , urging people to donate unwanted mobile phones in a bid to raise £ 2,000 to fund a potentially life - saving defibrillator at his school			0
they also want to raise funds to fund equipment at @entity118 .			0
