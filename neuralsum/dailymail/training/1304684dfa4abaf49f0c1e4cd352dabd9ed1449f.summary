home hunters spend less time deciding to buy a property than they do watching one episode of @entity5 , a new study reveals			1
research released today indicates we spend just 25 minutes and 30 seconds viewing a property before making a decision			1
this is almost five minutes less than it takes to watch one episode of the popular soap , including the advertisements			2
a lovely looking living room but almost three in ten homeowners ( 28 per cent ) would be quick to buy the house it is in because they ' did not want to put off the vendor by spending too much time there ' and this hasty decision could prove to be costly with the average @entity24 home selling for £ 250,000 - meaning each minute we decide to part with £ 9,804			1
what 's more , some of us are so eager to get the keys to a new home that we buy it before even seeing it for real , the study found			2
the new research , carried out by @entity36 , quizzed 2,000 @entity24 about how long it takes us to decide whether to buy a home or not			1
more than a quarter ( 27 per cent ) of potential buyers felt ' pressure ' from estate agents and 25 per cent were not sure how to arrange a second viewing it found one in eight ( 13 per cent ) purchased a property without even seeing it			1
meanwhile , one in five house hunters ( 17 per cent ) decided to buy within ten minutes or less			1
the study suggests we spend just seven and a half minutes more deciding on a new home than we do on a new pair of jeans			1
and it seems we allocate more time choosing which car to buy as it takes us 31 minutes to make that decision			1
the research comes as @entity36 released a new 21st century living : heads , @entity62			0
it reveals the reasons why we are so quick to purchase a new property			2
almost three in ten homeowners ( 28 per cent ) were quick to buy because they ' did not want to put off the vendor by spending too much time there '			1
home hunters spend less time deciding to buy a property than they do watching one episode of @entity5 - with the adverts - ( above ) , a new study reveals			1
more than a quarter ( 27 per cent ) felt ' pressure ' from estate agents and 25 per cent were not sure how to arrange a second viewing			0
one in ten ( 10 per cent ) said they had a ' lack of time ' and wanted to purchase the home there and then			1
the process leaves people feeling ' stressed ' ( five per cent ) and ' worried ' ( four per cent )			0
@entity87 , the ceo of @entity36 , said : ' purchasing a property , whether for the first time or the tenth time , is a major life investment			2
' it is really important for the buyer to be 100 per cent happy and confident in their decision			0
' but rushing this decision can and should be avoided			0
' considering a new build home is one way to do this - new build homes offer customers the opportunity to view a new property they 're interested in as many times as they like , without feeling pressured or rushed			1
' @entity36 teamed up with the @entity105 to gain further insight into the emotional factors affecting property buying			2
@entity109 , the author of watching the @entity110 : the @entity111 , said : ' given the deep emotional importance of the house in society , there is something very interesting about the disproportionately short amount of time - if any at all - that prospective buyers spend in a house before making the decision to buy			1
' when we enter a person 's home with the intention of buying it , it can seem strange and uncomfortable - like an imposition or invasion of privacy			2
