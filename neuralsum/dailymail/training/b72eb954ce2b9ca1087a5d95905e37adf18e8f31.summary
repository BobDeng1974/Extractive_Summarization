it is a view which is bound to make any sports fan set the countdown clock for 2016			0
these are the first images showing what we can expect from the @entity6 in just under three years ’ time			0
built on a waterfront peninsula in the @entity10 neighbourhood of the city , it stretches out over 300 acres and will help @entity13 host 15 @entity15 sports and 11 @entity17 competitions at 34 venues across the city			1
@entity44 - based @entity45 won the bid in 2011 , basing their design on classic @entity49 architecture and nature , with the aim to create a legacy for the city			0
the 15 venues will be interconnected by flowing pathways , intended to remind the great @entity56 , and for those who fail to get their hands on the much - coveted tickets , a waterfront open green space is to be built to host 12,000 people who will be able to follow the actions on big screens			2
a specific broadcast centre will play host to 20,000 journalists from around the world , and the @entity15 villages will be located nearby			2
architects say the construction of the @entity72 is set to be much more straight forward than the @entity73 , as several venues are already operating			1
paved with good intentions : what the park will look like in 2016 , during the @entity15 @entity15 legacy : once the @entity73 are over the @entity15 site , pictured as planned in 2018 , will begin a conversion from mammoth sports @entity81 to a resourceful addition to the city complete conversion : the image shows the site plan for 2013 , with many of the venues converted into housing and schools , much needed in @entity13 unlike the @entity93 , the main olympic stadium is not at the park - athletes will use the famous @entity49 football stadium , the @entity96 , which will also be the site of the opening and closing ceremonies as well as the @entity101 - home to the club side @entity102			1
the @entity40 itself is centered around three original sports venues which were built for the @entity38			1
the vision for the future is not just to create a global stage for the @entity15 and @entity17 of 2016 , but also , in the longer term , to create a new legacy district with new homes , jobs and places for leisure activities , ’ @entity105 said			0
' @entity115 needs to reflect the character and ambitions of the host city and this is where the differences between the two parks are most pronounced			0
‘ while @entity44 was about demonstrating how a short global event can lead to the long term regeneration of one of the most neglected and deprived areas of the city , @entity13 is about celebrating @entity49 's emergence as a world power as well as making sure there is a strong legacy plan in place			0
' good track record : the @entity44 architecture firm which was chosen to design the @entity13 site , was also responsible for creating the 2012 @entity40 in @entity43 lighting up the world : @entity13 's @entity40 will be located next to the water 's edge in the @entity10 area of the the city , built on the former @entity49 grand prix track			1
