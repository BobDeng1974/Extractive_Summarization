@entity0 , take a bow			1
then your man - of - the - match prize			0
it requires something special to shift the @entity7 spotlight away from @entity8 , but on a night when the @entity10 player did not quite produce his comic - book heroics , @entity13 's second choice staopper earned his nation a point with a performance that defied logic as much as the @entity19 attack on friday night			1
out from the @entity24 freezer , his string of saves very nearly got @entity25 all three			1
in added time , @entity8 advanced with predatory instinct and struck a fearsome shot that @entity29 strained every sinew to tip wide			1
then @entity8 whipped over the corner but @entity31 to get himself in a mess from two yards out			1
@entity25 forward @entity8 narrowly misses with this shot on goal against @entity19 @entity25 ( 3 - 5 - 2 ) : @entity0 8 ; @entity35 7 , a @entity36 6.5 , @entity37 6.5 , @entity38 6.5 , @entity39 6.5 ; @entity40 6.5 , @entity41 6 , @entity36 7 ( @entity42 83 ’ ) ; @entity8 7.5 , @entity43 5.5 ( @entity31 65 ’ 6.5 ) booked : @entity39 , @entity37 , @entity44 manager : @entity46 7 @entity19 ( 4 - 3 - 1 - 2 ) : @entity29 7 ; @entity47 6 , @entity48 6.5 , @entity49 6 , @entity50 6.5 ; @entity51 6.5 , @entity52 7.5 , @entity53 7 ; @entity54 7 ; @entity55 6.5 , @entity56 6.5 ( @entity57 83 ’ ) booked : @entity48 , @entity54 , @entity55 manager : @entity59 6.5 ref : @entity60 5 mom : @entity0 att : 30,741 @entity61 had an excellent chance too in the 78th minute , arriving unmarked onto @entity8 ’s free - kick six yards out only to head over			1
@entity0 provided that platform though , his best save of the night coming 10 minutes from the end			2
@entity54 hit his free - kick from 25 yards with dip and swerve but @entity0 threw his 6ft 6in frame into the air , reached up a glove , and diverted the ball wide			1
it was as thrilling as goalless draws come , and sees @entity25 top @entity75 in qualifying for @entity77			2
this was the most eagerly anticipated home international in years and it showed in the roads around @entity82			0
heavy traffic meant the stadium bore plenty of empty seats at kick - off			0
eventually the projected 30,741 crowd assembled to mark the biggest since @entity89 visited the @entity90 in march 2011			0
they had come hoping to see @entity25 make a statement of their intentions in this qualifying campaign ; they had come wanting @entity8 to do the business again			1
in the seventh minute , he should have			0
@entity40 fed the ball to @entity35 on the right wing and the @entity99 player immediately saw @entity8 had somehow been granted more space in the @entity19 area than he might expect walking atop @entity102			1
a swift cross followed but , from inside the six - yard box , @entity8 fluffed his lines and missed the ball			2
defender @entity49 leapt to divert it for a corner			0
it was a promising start nevertheless			0
@entity8 had another opportunity when @entity38 sent a high pass forward but world ’s most expensive left boot only managed to send a lofted volley wide			2
then @entity35 volleyed over from @entity39 ’s cross			0
@entity25 forward @entity8 gets in a shot at goal during the @entity77 qualifier @entity25 forward @entity8 races past @entity19 's @entity54 at @entity120 @entity25 ' @entity121 ( centre ) and @entity19 and @entity123 's @entity49 ( left ) battle for the ball gradually , though , with @entity126 ’s @entity52 doing an excellent job marking @entity8 , @entity19 gained increasing possession			1
@entity54 , so effective for @entity129 at @entity130 in the @entity131 , was at the heart of most it			2
he had already seen a deflected shot from range test @entity0 before he fired an effort just wide in the 27th minute			1
the second period saw @entity0 come to the fore			0
he may be keeping the @entity13 bench warm but he was alert time and again as @entity19 laid siege to the @entity7 goal for the first ten minutes after the interval			2
@entity25 ' goalkeeper @entity0 dives to make a save from @entity19 and @entity123 's @entity53 ( 3rd left ) @entity25 ' goalkeeper @entity0 ( 3rd @entity146 ) comes through a crowd of players to punch the ball clear @entity25 forward @entity31 has a shot at goal against @entity19 he spread himself to deny @entity53 from four yards following @entity153 ’s cross , then saved twice from @entity154 , the second at full - stretch as the @entity130 striker nodded a high ball into the far corner			1
his second save from @entity53 , as @entity25 groaned under the pressure , was just as impressive			0
he pushed the @entity19 ’s shot from range far away from the three lurking attackers			2
the intensity of the evening was laid bare when a mass melee broke out following @entity168 ’s firm , yet fair , tackle on @entity169 that earned him an undeserved yellow card			0
@entity61 and @entity55 were both booked by referee @entity171 , seemingly for the crime of being captains			1
the episode illustrated @entity7 steel , something missing during previous campaigns			0
‘ we dug deep , ’ said manager @entity46			0
‘ last time we got bullied by @entity19 ( in a 2012 friendly ) but we were never bullied tonight			0
’ @entity19 's striker @entity55 ( r ) runs with the ball during the @entity77 qualifier @entity8 remained upbeat despite failing to find a way through the visitors ' defence @entity25 defender @entity61 ( 2nd left ) went close with a header in the second half @entity8 clashes with @entity55 during a mass melee following @entity168 ’s firm tackle on @entity169 @entity31 had a great chance to grab a late winner but he got into a mess and put his header well wide @entity8 's girlfriend @entity194 ( centre right ) watches the action at the @entity120			1

@entity8 forced two fine saves from @entity29 in the @entity19 goal
@entity61 and @entity31 both headed wide from close range
@entity25 goalkeeper @entity0 made excellent saves to thwart @entity54 and @entity55
