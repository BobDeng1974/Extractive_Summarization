that finish he made for the equaliser , he does that day in and day out in training			0
‘ he ’s a player that is so fit and so strong			0
he is such a team player and does so much unselfish for work for the team but this year we are asking him to get more into the box			0
‘ his strength is that he can really penetrate the defensive line and he is an athlete – he can run all day – so i would expect him to be getting upwards of 10 goals this season because he has the quality and the tactical nose to arrive in the area to do that			2
