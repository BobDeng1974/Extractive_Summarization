it 's considered to be the world 's most sophisticated superfighter jet , but @entity4 's new £ 150million combat aircraft has been banned from flying in bad weather for fears it could explode			1
engineers working on the @entity9 have found the jet 's fuel tank could explode if hit by lightning			1
according to reports , the aircraft , which is hoped to enter service for both the @entity15 and the @entity16 in five years ' time , has also been made more vulnerable to enemy attack than the aircraft it is set to replace , after its weight was reduced in an attempt to increase fuel efficiency			2
the @entity9 , also known as the @entity9 ( @entity9 ) , has been banned from flying in bad weather , for fear its fuel tank could explode if hit by lightning @entity28 has reported the revelations were disclosed in a leaked report from the @entity32 's operational test and evaluation office , which states that , until a device in the fuel tank is redesigned , test - flying within 25 miles of thunderstorms is ' not permitted '			1
several other problems have been identified with the plane , including a fault in the design of the fuel tank which means it is unable to rapidly descend to low altitude			1
a handful of cracks were also discovered in the tested aircraft during examinations by the @entity48 and the aircraft 's manufacturer @entity49			0
the report states : ' all of these discoveries will require mitigation plans and may include redesigning parts and additional weight			0
' a @entity49 spokesman has said the manufacturer does not consider the latest problem a ' major issue '			0
the spokesman said : ' we have demonstrated very good vulnerability performance and we continue to work with the @entity63			0
' the new fighter jet has been designed to be practically invisible to radar and has a top speed of 1,300mph the short take - off and vertical - landing version of the @entity69 is due to become @entity4 's replacement for the harrier			2
the new fighter jet has been designed to be practically invisible to radar and has a top speed of 1,300mph and a range of 1,450 miles , compared to the @entity71 's 700mph and range of 350 mile range			0
the latest revelation is the second blow to the programme in recent weeks , after @entity82 pulled out of a deal to buy 65 of the aircraft last month			0
and while the @entity85 is buying 2,500 f - 35s for £ 254bn , @entity4 is committed to buying only 48 , although the final decision will depend on the role of the @entity16 's two new carriers in the future and whether the price of the aircraft falls , as is expected			1
a @entity93 spokesman said : ' all variants of @entity9 are currently within the development test phase and minor issues like this are common during this early stage of the overall programme			2
' it has been reported that until a device in the fuel tank is redesigned , test - flying within 25 miles of thunderstorms is ' not permitted '			1
