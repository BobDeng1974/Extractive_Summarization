@entity0 has given a clear indication that @entity3 ’s scintillating form will be rewarded with a senior call up for @entity6 ’s internationals in march			1
the @entity8 striker has enjoyed an outstanding season , scoring 20 goals , securing a new five - and - a - half - year contract and the final gloss would be for @entity13 to name him in his party for the @entity16 qualifier against @entity17 and the friendly against @entity19 next month			1
@entity0 , @entity6 ’s under - 21 head coach , will have no qualms if @entity13 does take @entity3 from his group rather than leave @entity3 to be selected for the under - 21s key friendlies against the @entity24 and @entity25			1
@entity3 has been tipped prosper for @entity6 at both levels this year by @entity0 the under 21 coach says that @entity3 could still join up with his side in the summer @entity3 has been an integral part of the under - 21 team in the last 12 months and is expected to be a key figure at the forthcoming @entity32 and @entity0 believes it is possible for him to go up to the seniors before dropping back down in june			1
‘ there is no reason he would n’t come with us in the summer , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ it is easy for him to do both			2
he falls into that category that he has been with us right the way through			0
i think he would want to come and be on that stage really			0
‘ it is still a terrific stage when you look at some of the players in the last couple of tournaments ; all of the @entity52 group , including @entity53 and @entity54			0
@entity55 ( @entity19 ) , some of the @entity58 boys at the @entity60 - 20 @entity59 , ( @entity62 ) @entity61			2
‘ clearly someone like @entity3 , going as well as he is , might get the nod ( in march )			1
that ’s @entity13 ’s call			2
it depends how others are doing and if he is still delivering when we get nearer that time , which is still a few weeks			0
‘ but it has been brilliant how he has kept his form for quite a sustained period so let ’s hope he can continue that			0
he ’s in a great place at the moment , as is @entity74			0
@entity74 is going to improve and improve			0
he has the right mentality and is at a club where the ethic is good , to work and learn			0
’ @entity3 has been in sparkling form for @entity8 this season and has scored 20 goals in all competitions @entity13 has admitted he is impressed by @entity3 's form and is considering calling the striker up @entity3 won his first under - 21 cap when @entity13 took temporary charge for the friendly against @entity87 in august 2013 and has gone on to make nine more appearances , scoring eight times			1
but this season he has looked a different player and @entity0 puts that down to his club manager ’s influence			1
‘ i know the way @entity95 works and i am sure the sessions they are doing on and off the training ground will have helped that , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ we saw with @entity95 last year at @entity100 he is not afraid to give people a chance if they are doing well			0
he has given @entity103 an opportunity and he is keeping some outstanding players out of the team			0
