by @entity1 reporter published : 20:14 est , 3 march 2013 updated : 14:45 est , 4 march 2013 a link between obesity and the deadliest form of skin cancer has been uncovered by scientists			1
they found that the gene most strongly related to being very overweight also increases the risk of malignant melanoma , implying that people who are obese may be at increased risk of developing skin cancer			1
until now experts thought that the illness was primarily caused by intense sunbathing or frequent use of sunbeds			0
scientists have found the gene most strongly related to being very overweight also increases the risk of malignant melanoma but researchers from @entity21 and the @entity22 believe the gene called @entity24 may also have a role			2
their study , published in the journal @entity28 , looked at the dna of 73,000 patients including 13,000 with skin cancer			1
those with a particular variation of the @entity24 gene were far more likely to develop the illness			0
malignant melanoma is the fifth most common cancer in the @entity36 with around 12,800 new cases and around 2,200 deaths each year			0
experts previously thought that malignant melanoma was primarily caused by intense sunbathing or frequent use of sunbeds ( file picture ) lead author dr @entity43 , said : ‘ this is the first time to our knowledge that this major obesity gene , already linked to multiple illnesses , has been linked to melanoma			1
‘ this raises the question whether future research will reveal that the gene has a role in even more diseases			0
’ dr @entity55 , @entity21 ’s senior science information manager , said : ‘ these are fascinating early findings that , if confirmed in further research , could potentially provide new targets for the development of drugs to treat melanoma			0
‘ advances in understanding more about the molecules driving skin cancer have already enabled us to develop important new skin cancer drugs that will make a real difference for patients			2

scientists find gene @entity24 may have role in obesity and skin cancer
study looked at dna of 73,000 patients including 13,000 with skin cancer
previously though illness was mainly caused by sunbathing and sunbeds
