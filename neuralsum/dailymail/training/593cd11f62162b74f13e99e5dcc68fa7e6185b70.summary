per @entity1 accepted @entity0 undid all of their recent good defensive work by not being ' switched on ' in allowing @entity4 to come from behind to win the north @entity6 derby 2 - 1 at @entity7			1
the @entity8 had looked set for another positive away performance when they snatched the lead through a fine volley from @entity12 after 11 minutes			2
however , @entity4 soon regained momentum as @entity0 struggled to deal with the impressive midfield work - rate from @entity16 's men			1
per @entity1 ( centre ) admits @entity0 were n't defensively switched on during their 2 - 1 defeat to @entity4 @entity1 ( left ) and the @entity0 defence failed to contain the threat of @entity4 ' @entity21 in the second half @entity21 ( second left ) rises highest to head the ball expertly into the corner to give @entity4 the win vs @entity0 the industry of the home side was rewarded when @entity21 swept in an equaliser as he ghosted in unmarked at the far post when @entity0 failed to deal with a corner at the start of the second half			1
just when it seemed @entity0 had done enough to maintain their recent unbeaten run , another lapse in concentration at the back allowed in - form @entity21 to get between @entity35 and @entity36 to head home @entity39 's deep left - wing cross			1
@entity0 - who had won five successive matches ahead of saturday 's poor display , including a battling victory at @entity46 - find themselves below @entity4 in sixth place in the @entity48 and must now regroup quickly for tuesday night 's visit of bottom club @entity50 to keep the pressure up on the top four			1
' we found a way recently to prepare ourselves on crosses better defensively ( and also ) on set - pieces , but we did not switch on quickly enough and were not up for proper defending , so that was worse than in recent weeks , ' @entity1 said on @entity59			0
' we were not active enough and only started to play our game a bit towards the end , that took us too long			0
@entity63 ( right ) challenges @entity4 midfielder @entity64 for the ball during their encounter ' when we had the ball , we could not find any solutions , they were always at us and we could not get the ball quickly in our own half so we could not hurt them on the counter-attack			2
' the @entity75 , who is captaining the side with midfielder @entity78 still injured , added : ' we have to analyse the problems they caused us , then we focus on tuesday to bounce back from this setback as quickly as possible			0
' @entity8 boss @entity82 accepted his side paid a heavy price for ' too many technical mistakes in the middle of the park ' and was also less than impressed at the way @entity4 crafted a late winner			0
he said : ' ( for the second goal ) @entity21 had a completely free header in the box , with five minutes to go , that is difficult to understand with the experience we have at the back			0
' i am disappointed by the quality of our football and it was just not good enough			0
' @entity8 boss @entity82 was unimpressed by his side 's defending for @entity21 's late winner @entity0 are expected to have leading scorer @entity102 back from a hamstring problem on tuesday , while @entity104 is pressing for a recall having been left on the bench as fit - again @entity107 started at @entity7			1
@entity82 maintains @entity50 will be no pushovers , despite being rooted to the foot of the table after a third - straight league defeat when beaten 1 - 0 at home by @entity113 , if his team do not produce the required performance			2
' we play at home against @entity50 , a team who fight not to go down , ' said @entity82			0
' we have to recover from the disappointment and be ready to respond very quickly			0
' @entity0 hope to have have @entity102 fit for tuesday 's game against @entity50 after a hamstring injury			1

@entity4 beat @entity0 2 - 1 in the @entity124 on saturday
@entity12 but the visitors ahead but two @entity21 goals won it for @entity4
result sees @entity4 *leapfrog* their rivals into *5th* spot in @entity48
@entity0 *entertain* @entity50 in their next @entity48 match on tuesday
