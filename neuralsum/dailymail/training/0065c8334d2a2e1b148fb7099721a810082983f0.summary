cult leader @entity0 has spent the past six years behind bars after being arrested and later convicted of sexual abuse of young girls , but that has not stopped him from continuing to exude complete control over his polygamous community			1

the @entity29 holds polygamy as a fundamental belief and its men take multiple wives in what are termed ' celestial marriages ' each performed in a ceremony called a ' sealing '			2
the @entity44 - based church believes polygamy brings exaltation in heaven and arranged marriages sometimes involve underage girls			0
more than a year after his conviction of child sex abuse , it appears that little has changed in the remote @entity55 compound in @entity56 housing the @entity29 , a radical wing of the @entity58			1

children of cult members receive little more than a grade school education where science and history are ignored in favour of religious studies with an emphasis on @entity0 ’ proverbs , and where every school book must be personally approved by the leader			1
totalitarian leader : @entity0 was convicted last year of molesting two teenage girls and sentenced to life in prison , but he continues to have control over his sect one proverb reads : ' when you disobey there must and will always be a punishment			1
' children in the local schoolhouse are also taught that @entity0 was the president of the @entity26 and that @entity11 led @entity104 away from the moon during the @entity106			2
when questioned by an @entity7 reporter about their general level of knowledge , a trio of girls who escaped the cult several months earlier along with their mother said that they had never heard of @entity114 , @entity115 or @entity116			0

the @entity29 organization is protected by @entity44 ’s homeschooling law , which means that state officials have no say about the content of the curriculum taught on the grounds of the secured compound			2
in august 2011 , @entity0 , 56 , was found guilty of molesting two girls ages 12 and 15 whom he took as brides in ' spiritual marriages ’			2

so far , all seven , who have been prosecuted , have been convicted - receiving prison sentences of between six and 75 years			0
in recent months , it appears that the all - powerful self - proclaimed prophet has begun unraveling , issuing ever more bizarre edicts to the members of his community such as a ban on children ’s toys and the consumption of corn			0
more importantly , @entity0 has ordered married couples in his community to stop having sex or even touching one another			1
instead , he selected 15 men from among his trusted followers to father all the future @entity29 children			1
now , if a woman wants to have a baby , she has to approach one of the men handpicked for the task by @entity0			2
the sexual act must be witnessed by two other men from the group			0
in a tragic twist , the jailed cult leader ordered that 500 - 600 men and women be banished without any explanation from the compound , which for many of them had been the only home they had ever known			1
the effect of this decree issued from behind bars has been devastating to many families that were torn apart			0
so absolute is @entity0 ’ control over his flock that those members who were ordered to leave , severed all ties with their loved ones still living on the compound for fear of retribution			2
