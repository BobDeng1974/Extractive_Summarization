it has been a cracking @entity1 so far			1
even the dullest of games ( looking at you , @entity6 v @entity5 ! ) have had the decency to end with a bit of drama			0
but with the tournament now building towards sunday 's final , and just two teams remaining ( excluding the perennially pointless third - placed playoff ) , attention 's are slowly turning towards the start of next season			0
and what are often the main points of topic in the campaign following a @entity1 ? @entity21			2
lack of a proper break for star players			0
then come @entity48 in second , with 2,748 minutes clocked up so far			1
and with @entity65 stars @entity45 , @entity66 and @entity67 still involved , that number could very well increase			0
in fact , the potential signings of @entity69 ( 390 minutes ) and @entity70 ( 360 minutes ) would also see the club rise above @entity46 on the list - but until those moves are completed , @entity48 remain firmly in the second spot			1
@entity76 are third on 2,740 minutes , including 90 from new signing @entity77 , whilst cross-town rivals @entity79 are currently fourth with 2,548 - a number which could yet fall should @entity81 ( 360 minutes ) move on			1
@entity82 round out the top five on 1,932 minutes - with @entity84 clocking up 450 of those for @entity85 - and @entity86 are sixth on 1,722 minutes ( including new signings @entity87 and @entity89 ) , although they could lose 178 of those should @entity90 complete a potential move away			1
switch : @entity77 has left @entity48 for @entity76 , whilst it seems that @entity81 is on his way out of @entity79 but not forgotten : whilst @entity90 made quite an impact in just 178 minutes in @entity30 @entity96 players flop in @entity30 @entity97 and @entity98 are 7th and 8th , on 1,029 and 984 minutes respectively , whilst @entity99 racked up 867 minutes in @entity30 - mostly thanks to @entity100 goalkeeper @entity36 's 570			1
@entity102 rest in 10th on 816 minutes at the moment , with one of those being registered by the mighty @entity105			0
but they are set to lose 360 of the rest as soon as @entity70 's departure to @entity48 is confirmed			2
@entity108 clocked up 600 minutes of @entity112 's 681 ( with new signing @entity109 managing 81 ) , whilst @entity111 are just behind on 679			0
then come @entity113 on 437 , @entity114 with 364 pitch minutes and @entity116 recorded all 270 minutes for @entity117			0
pain : @entity36 clocked up 570 minutes for @entity30 and @entity99 so far			2
though he hopes to forget some of it big man : @entity108 clocked up 600 of @entity112 's 681 @entity1 minutes those racking up below 100 minutes were @entity122 's 90 minutes for @entity123 , @entity125 's @entity124 getting 71 for @entity126 and finally @entity127 's 23 minutes for @entity128			2
rock bottom , however , were @entity130 and @entity131 , with neither having a single players at the @entity1			1
will it all make a difference on the outcome of the @entity27 next season ? only time will tell .			0

@entity46 top the list of most minutes played at the @entity1 so far
@entity48 lie in second with @entity76 third and @entity79 fourth
@entity82 round out the top five whilst @entity131 and @entity130 fail to clock up a single minute in @entity30
