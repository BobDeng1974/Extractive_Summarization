by @entity0 @entity2 chief @entity1 is determined to ban clubs from @entity5 competitions in 12 months if they continue to stick two fingers up at financial fair play regulations – causing further problems for the toxic @entity11 brand			1
@entity13 - owned @entity12 and @entity11 - owned @entity14 have already been punished with a heavy fine and squad reduction after running up excessive losses			1
@entity1 is now prepared to push through the ultimate sanction – exclusion from the @entity20 – for repeat offenders			0
watching : @entity1 is determined to ban clubs from @entity5 competitions if they ignore @entity25 rules punished : @entity12 owner @entity26 was found in breach of the @entity25 regulations significantly , he has the backing of many of @entity2 ’s leading clubs including @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 and @entity36 who argue spending should fall in line with revenue			1
ironically , @entity2 ’s governing body are not expecting further problems with @entity12 , whose owner @entity26 is working hard on cutting losses			2
@entity12 reported losses of £ 51.6m in their latest set of financial figures in january which broke @entity2 ’s £ 37million threshold , but it was greatly reduced from the previous year ’s deficit of £ 97.9m			1
but @entity14 , @entity52 , a venture of the @entity11 government , have incensed @entity1 and other @entity2 bigwigs by completing the £ 48milion signing of @entity57 from @entity35 while they were being warned about their over-spending			1
it is seen within the game ’s governing body as deliberately provocative and is leading to a resolve that they will punish @entity63 more severely unless they take heed of @entity2 ’s wishes			0
@entity11 is already under huge international scrutiny following allegations that they used bribery as a tool to be awarded the @entity71			0
too far : @entity14 have incensed @entity1 by signing @entity35 's @entity57 for £ 48million during over-spending row @entity12 and @entity63 were each fined £ 49million by @entity2 last month , £ 32million of which was suspended , after failing financial fair play rules			1
in addition , they can only name a 21 - man @entity20 squad next season instead of he usual 25 , and can spend only £ 49million net in transfers in this window , and not increase the club ’s overall wage bill			0
a senior source said : ‘ there is a perception that @entity1 does n’t want to take @entity14 on because they are a @entity87 club			2
‘ but the reality is he and others are fuming at the way they seem to be carry on spending despite already being fined			0
there is a real resolution within @entity2 and among the other clubs to impose a @entity20 ban on any club that carries on playing outside the rules			2
’ @entity11 have spent millions trying to gain respectability through football , sponsoring @entity34 among other clubs as well as buying @entity63 and winning a vote to host the @entity71			0
but the game 's rulers are now aware of a public backlash against a perception of @entity11 " buying " football and are determined not to allow @entity63 to outspend other clubs			0
