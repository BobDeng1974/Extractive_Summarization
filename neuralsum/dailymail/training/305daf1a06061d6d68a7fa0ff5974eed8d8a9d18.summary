by @entity0 published : 17:33 est , 4 june 2013 updated : 19:56 est , 4 june 2013 the d word is now officially part of the @entity3 spot - fixing scandal			1
@entity6 chief @entity5 says he has incontrovertible evidence linking the sordid saga to its d - company masters in @entity10 and @entity11			1
he told mail today : " we have extensive details of phone numbers based abroad in @entity16 and @entity11 highlighting the network and apparatus			2
" we are very clear that this is organised crime and that the entire operation was run by the underworld syndicate as a triangulated play : @entity23 - @entity11			2
" all roads lead to @entity25 : @entity6 believe infamous gangster @entity26 ( left ) and his longstanding aide @entity27 ( right ) have been running a spot - fixing network through their underworld contacts in several countries on tuesday , the @entity6 named underworld @entity31 and his close aide @entity27 as co-accused in the case , saying fixing was done at their behest			1
ironically , the dramatic move came on a day that saw @entity39 principal @entity38 , actor @entity40 and seven other accused in a parallel betting probe being granted bail by a @entity23 court			0
the @entity6 said that the command for spot - fixing originated from underworld don @entity26 's outfit			1
asserting that the main bookies @entity50 , @entity51 and even the cricketers were in direct touch with the fugitive don , the police invoked the stringent @entity55 ( @entity55 ) against disgraced cricketer @entity56 and 22 others in the case			1
that there was mafia - style muscle - flexing involved has been made clear by @entity62 's top cop			2
@entity6 have invoked the stringent @entity55 against cricketers @entity56 , @entity64 and @entity65 " we have intercepts of top bookie @entity67 threatening cricketers and anybody else who needed to be threatened , saying clearly that the underworld wants this done or you are imperiled			1
the size and scale of the operation is humungous			2
let me tell you that the extent of the malfeasance is widespread and the rot has set in deep			0
money running into thousands of crores is changing hands with the hawala route back in our crosshairs , " he said			1
@entity27 on tuesday confirmed @entity5 's assertion			1
in an exclusive telephonic interview with @entity89 , @entity27 said : " yes , we threaten bookies , cricketers and filmstars			1
we threaten them when it is required			0
but this does n't means that we are involved in spot - fixing			1
" @entity62 police commissioner @entity5 said of the @entity3 scam : " the malfeasance is widespread and the rot has set in deep " @entity5 explained that bail is going to be that much more difficult since the offences are now in the domain of organised crime			2
" and anyone who partakes in this conspiracy becomes an accused , " he said			0
what @entity55 does is give @entity6 that much more time to interrogate all the accused and take every lead to its logical culmination			2
" we want to file the chargesheet as early as possible			0
we are also examining the role of another team and three other players by connecting the dots , " @entity5 added			2
a senior police official associated with the probe said they had enough call intercepts to showed the bookies had made calls to @entity11 , @entity16 and other cities of @entity10 to fix and alter betting rates			2
" efforts are also underway to nab a @entity125 - based person who could lead to the door of another cricket team whose players were allegedly involved in spot - fixing			1
the person was named by bookie @entity132 , arrested in @entity125 , during his questioning , " the official added			2
explaining its @entity55 move , the police said : " since the accused persons were acting on command of people based abroad like @entity26 and @entity27 who have a continuous past record of organised crimes , provisions of @entity55 have been invoked against the accused			1
" detailing @entity25 's role in the fixing scandal , the police said that @entity25 's syndicate controlled gambling in @entity148 through hawala channels and also fixed the rates of gambling			1
" this organised crime syndicate besides controlling illegal betting was indulging in fixing performance of players and rates of betting , " the police said			0
by @entity158 in @entity159 @entity161 actor @entity160 , arrested in the @entity3 spot - fixing scam , was till recently a director in the @entity159 's leading jewellery firm - @entity164 - which belongs to the two absconding bookie - brothers @entity167 alias @entity165 and @entity170 alias @entity159			0
it department during a massive raid conducted last year on @entity174 ' premises had unearthed unaccounted money to the tune of about rs 100 crore plus assets and gold worth around rs 2 crore			0
at that time , the department failed to comprehend the significance of @entity182 's connection with the @entity164			0
@entity183 was arrested after the investigators traced his calls to the two brothers			0
invocation of @entity55 against accused in the spot - fixing case might appear to be a fillip for the @entity6 in strengthening its case , but its sustainability is questionable in the court of law , according to legal experts			1
lawyers feel @entity55 has been slapped in this case only for the purpose of denying bail to the accused			0
according to legal luminaries , slapping of @entity55 against the accused is not relevant in this case and it will be a herculean task for police to justify the invocation of this harsh act before the court after filing of the charge - sheet			0
senior advocate @entity209 explained : " for @entity55 to be attracted against anybody , elements of violence , coercion and intimidation should be there			0
but it seems to be absolutely missing in the case			0
it will be very difficult for police to justify @entity55 in this case			0
" by @entity0 underworld don @entity26 's close aide @entity27 revealed that many cricketers and bookies were in touch with d - company and were threatened			1
in an exclusive telephone interview with @entity89 , @entity27 said : " yes we threaten bookies , cricketers and film - stars			1
we threaten them when it is required			0
but this does n't mean that we are involved in spot - fixing			2
" when asked that under pressure of d - company many cricketers were forced to execute deals relating to spot - fixing , @entity27 said d - company is close to many bookies			1
" we speak to many players but we do not want to take their names			0
will it be fair if i reveal that i have given money to some players , " he added			0
on charges of operating one of the biggest cricket - betting syndicate in @entity247 , @entity27 said : " is betting a crime ? lot of people bet in the world			1
should it be brought under @entity55 ? " @entity27 was of the view that @entity254 should also be put under the scanner in the betting case .			0
