the distance from the @entity1 to the @entity2 is less than half a mile			2
the last time we met for dinner , @entity3 had to get a taxi			1
he started off with the best intentions for a short stroll , but retired hurt no more than 50 yards down @entity9			2
this was before his left knee went , too			1
back then , it was just the right that had him in agony			2
his condition has deteriorated greatly			2
@entity3 quit @entity18 on tuesday with the club second bottom of the @entity21 @entity3 says his knee problem was the main reason why he had to quit @entity18 as he could no longer walk @entity3 outside his home in @entity25 on several occasions over the last two years , @entity3 has considered resigning from football management			1
he misses the hands - on engagement of coaching , he misses getting out onto the training field as he used to			1
he still scouts games , but it 's a chore			2
he has to make plans for staircases , for distant car parks ; if he 's on the wrong side of the stadium , it can take him 20 minutes to get to his seat			2
sooner or later , something had to give			2
he quit @entity18 on tuesday , after being told he would need replacements for both right and left knees			1
unable to walk even 100 yards , he accepted he was not the man to lead @entity18 into their relegation fight			1
and he called owner @entity46 in the small hours to deliver the news , shortly before sharing the decision with his son , @entity49			1
' i was awake all night , thinking about it , ' @entity3 told me			1
' i 'm struggling so badly now			2
i ca n't walk , i can barely stand and watch			2
i 'm in pain all the time			1
i 've been putting it off , and putting it off , but it has got to the stage where i can not do the job			2
' i booked a ticket for @entity61 's @entity60 game with @entity62 on tuesday night , but my first thought was , " how am i going to get to the ground ? " even if i get a car park pass there is going to be some walking			1
i ca n't walk around @entity68 anymore , i ca n't walk down the street – that 's how bad it has got			0
' i went to see my grandson play football at the weekend , and after five minutes had to go back to the car			0
i could n't even stand up			0
what sort of life is it if you ca n't watch the kids play ? that sort of made my mind up			0
' i went to bed thinking i would sleep on it , but then i could n't sleep a wink			0
that 's when i decided to call @entity46			1
it must have been 5.30am			1
i just told him he needed someone who could properly coach and manage the team in the next ten weeks			1
it 's such an important time			1
they need someone who can give it everything			0
' @entity3 says he had a good relationship with @entity18 owner @entity46 @entity3 guided @entity18 back to the @entity21 at the first attempt via the play - offs @entity3 says @entity98 was his only transfer target on deadline day - but he was too expensive @entity3 's resignation immediately brought speculation that he had become frustrated at a lack of activity in the transfer window			1
rangers face financial fair play restrictions , and a huge fine , and have been working to cut budgets			0
yet he insisted this was not the case			0
' i have n't got the hump , we have n't had a row , ' said @entity3			1
' i knew some while ago that we were not going to be able to get much done in january			0
' we had one real target on the last day , @entity98 , because we are short upfront			0
but he was too much money			0
there are no hard feelings on my part – i 've not had a problem with @entity46 in all my time there			1
' i even went to training this [ tuesday ] morning because it was my intention to say goodbye to the lads			1
i went to sort out some bits and pieces with the club and by the time i had finished they were gone			1
it 's been that quick			0
i just made my mind up because events were piling up			0
being told i needed both knees replaced was a huge blow			0
it would put me out of the game for months because you ca n't have them done together			0
' @entity143 called me when he heard the news and we were talking about our time together at @entity18 last year			1
he reminded me that i was on crutches for 10 weeks back then			1
it 's been a problem for too long now			0
' i know what people think - that i 've been sacked , or stormed off because we could n't get the players in			1
' my son @entity49 said that my timing has to be the worst in the world			0
when i look back on my career , it certainly is n't my strong point - but i ca n't control what people think			2
i feel positive about the future at @entity18 - @entity161 is back at the weekend and he will make a huge difference			1
we 've got other players coming back from injury , too - if i could get out and coach them like i could five years ago , i 'd be optimistic			1
' @entity3 and @entity18 have not won a single point away from home this season his wife , @entity168 , broke a knee cap too , before @entity170 , stumbling over the vacuum cleaner			1
he regrets not being at home more to tend to her and you can sense a desire to be closer to home			0
' i was totally honest with @entity46			1
i told him he needed someone who could commit to every aspect of the job in the next ten weeks , and that 's not me			2
i still do n't think i 'm finished with football			0
when i 've had the operations , i 'll be looking for work again , i know that			0
i ca n't imagine my life without it			0
but right now , i 've got to make my health the priority			0
' i ca n't even walk the dogs			0
i stand watching the team play , and i 'm struggling			0
it 's reached a point where i ca n't ignore it any longer			0
it 's not a decision i would take lightly			2
i 've thought about it a few times this season , but have always decided to give it one last go			0
' the last week has been the tipping point			0
i can barely move and i 'm not enjoying my life			0
i need to get this done as quickly as i can and try to move on			0
@entity202 at @entity203 told me had a knee replacement and was ready to go again after six weeks			1
i 'm not sure i 'll be hopping about in that time , but i 'll talk to @entity205 , my surgeon , and we 'll work out a plan			2
' @entity3 's final game in charge of @entity18 was the 3 - 1 defeat at @entity211 on saturday afternoon			1

@entity3 resigned as @entity18 manager on tuesday
@entity3 says he needs knee replacements and was unable to *continue*
