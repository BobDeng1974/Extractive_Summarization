by @entity0 published : 20:49 est , 10 february 2013 updated : 07:56 est , 11 february 2013 an entire town was in mourning today after @entity3 , the world ’s largest crocodile in captivity – and a huge money - spinner – died in its man - made lake of a mystery illness			1
the 21ft , one - tonne saltwater crocodile , which was captured less than 18 months ago by a team of brave men in the southern @entity14 , was found lying upside down in its enclosure in an eco-tourism park			1
@entity3 , believed to be more than 50 years old , fell ill after swallowing a nylon cord about three weeks ago			1
he was left with nonstop diarrhoea , @entity18 reported			0
@entity3 , named after a famed @entity14 hunter , had been blamed for the deaths of several fishermen before its dramatic capture in the marshes near the town of @entity27 ( population 35,000 ) , 515 miles south east of @entity29			1
villagers are devastated at the loss thirty men had spent three weeks trying to capture the huge reptile before they finally snared it in september 2011 using a dead pig as bait and throwing steel cables over it			0
a tractor was needed to haul it onto a trailer – but not before local people had crowded around the crocodile to pose for photos with their world - record catch			2
since then , @entity3 has been a star attraction at the tourism park and town councillors gleefully announced that their small town had finally found its place on the world map			1
but today many of the townsfolk were in tears on learning that @entity3 had died within a year and a half of being moved to its new home			1
‘ we do n’t know what happened to it , ’ said the shocked mayor , @entity63 , who reportedly cradled the colossal creature in his arms before it died ,			1
‘ its death is a complete mystery and i have to admit that i ’m really depressed			0
‘ i ’ve come to love that crocodile			0
it brought fame and fortune to our town and , in a small way , to the @entity14			1
’ this september 2011 file picture shows the capture of @entity3			2
it was the largest crocodile in captivity , measuring 6.17 metres prize catch : villagers pose with newly - captured beast			1
it was hunted after a spate of attacks on humans and livestock , officials said mr @entity63 said that after the crocodile ’s capture - which made international headlines – a special eco-tourism park was created to house it			0
local people and foreign tourists made special trips to the remote community to gaze in awe at the enormous creature			1
‘ we were planning to build a special road leading to the park because we were getting so many tourists , but now i ’m not so sure whether we will proceed with it , ’ said the mayor			2
‘ perhaps the plan will go ahead if we can catch more crocodiles – there are many more out there - but i ca n’t say whether they will have the same appeal as @entity3			2
‘ you only had to see him and you ’d stand there staring as if under a spell			0
’ colossus : residents use their hands to measure @entity3 , which is suspected of having attacked several people			2
it weighed 600 kg at the time of its capture tourists from far and wide flocked to see @entity3 in his purpose - built enclosure in the town when rangers at the park found @entity3 floating on its back they called for immediate help from mr @entity133 , a veterinarian who specialises in reptiles			1
he found that @entity3 was still alive but close to death and as a desperate measure he and park rangers immersed it in lukewarm water			2
the region has been hit by unusually cold weather this month and mr @entity133 suggested this might have had something to do with the crocodile ’s dire condition			0
despite all efforts , however , @entity3 was declared dead a few hours later			0
as word spread through the town , many people gathered in the streets and wept			0
this picture gives an impression of the true scale of the enormous creature but mayor @entity63 said all was not lost – for there are now plans to have @entity3 stuffed and put on display			1
‘ i think it might still attract people even in death because it is such an enormous creature , ’ said mr @entity63			0
‘ i think even the locals who have seen it when it was alive will come back – they are n’t going to let him slip from their memories , of that i ’m sure			0
’ an autopsy is expected today to determine the cause of death .			0
