devoted : @entity0 and @entity1			1
the couple met while he was a young academic at @entity3 the film @entity4 , about the novelist @entity1 ’s descent into alzheimer ’s disease , was directed by @entity7 — whose own mother suffered from this appalling form of dementia			1
it was , obviously , an extremely harrowing story , which touched the hearts of many			0
audiences watched the young @entity4 ( played by @entity14 ) , a tousled tomboy cycling round @entity3 , her head full of philosophy and the fiction which would make her name			1
then we saw @entity21 ( as the older @entity4 ) in a cardie , becoming at first muddled , and then more or less witless			1
@entity4 ’s husband , @entity0 , in old age , was played by @entity25 , an avuncular , gentle figure , whose devotion to his wife was saint - like			1
i watched the film , which appeared in 2001 , with a mixture of emotions			0
i had known @entity0 , who died this week aged 89 , and @entity4 well for many years			1
@entity0 had been my tutor at university , and @entity4 was a good friend , who encouraged me in my early writing career			1
we had seen a great deal of one another in over 30 years of friendship			0
like all their friends , i had admired the gallant way in which @entity0 coped with his wife ’s illness			1
he scarcely left her side during the four years the nightmare went on			0
no doubt about it , @entity0 was a hero in the way he had nursed her			1
but even before she died , he published a memoir — the book on which the film was based , and what would be the first of a trilogy about @entity4			1
it was moving , telling how , as a shy young academic at @entity59 , @entity3 , he had one day looked out of the window and seen this young woman ( rather older than himself ) cycling past			0
he had decided she was the girl for him — not because he fancied her , but because he did n’t ! scared of sex , he was not particularly interested in the act ( still less in the idea of offspring )			0
the passages about sex in the book were both unconvincing and more than a little bit troubling			2
but if we all knew that @entity4 was bisexual and that she had several lovers , none of us guessed , until a biography published after her death , how unfaithful she had been			1
there were dozens of lovers , throughout her marriage			2
i had always had a half - sense that this pair , so close in many ways , and so obviously in a ‘ good marriage ’ , were not quite as other couples			0
i suppose i had known them about 20 years when @entity4 suggested she and i went to lunch , just the two of us			1
another friend of theirs , who had known @entity0 since they were students together , said : ‘ but you normally have lunch with @entity0			1
’ ‘ yes , ’ i replied , ‘ but @entity4 has suggested we meet up in @entity96			1
’ ‘ well , i ’m telling you , ’ said the friend , ‘ if you say yes , you ’ll never have another lunch with @entity0			1
’ i thought the friend was being absurd			0
at the time , i had lunch with @entity0 , on average , every couple of weeks , and had done so for 20 years			1
i did not refuse @entity4 ’s invitation			1
adaptation : the couple were played by @entity25 and @entity21 ( pictured ) in the film version of @entity4 but sure enough , my friend was right			1
though i sometimes had dinner with them together , that lunch with @entity4 was enough to bring my special friendship with @entity0 to an end			1
i realised then how very jealous he was , and after she died , i saw how much he must have resented her repeated unfaithfulness			2
when i reread his accounts of their life together , and of her illness , i came to think that , despite his love and willingness to care for her , other things had been going on as well			2
one was a possessive desire to have @entity4 all to himself			1
another was a little like vengeance			0
his accounts of her ‘ in her water - buffalo guise ’ — a reference to her lumbering movements — are not very loving			0
the descriptions of her loss of bodily control , of her dirtiness , of his need to hose her down when she was doubly incontinent , are profoundly shameful			1
these descriptions , and the subsequent film , had the effect of almost expunging @entity1 ’s fame as a writer			0
she was no longer the woman who , for three decades and more , had written witty novels about the emotional chaos in which we live			0
she was the @entity147 ’s lady played by @entity21			1
had @entity0 intended this ? as well as being an @entity3 don and literary critic , he was an unsuccessful novelist			1
was he , consciously or not , envious of his wife ’s success , and boiling with resentment at all the girlfriends and boyfriends with whom she had made a fool of him ? that was how it must have seemed to many readers of his very strange memoirs			2
i published my own account of the @entity4 i knew , and did not hide my unhappiness at @entity0 ’s unflinching portrait of her			1
strange : @entity0 's descriptions in his memoir , and the subsequent film , had the effect of almost expunging @entity1 ’s fame as a writer			1
above , the couple together but the years have passed , and now that he is dead , i find my mind going back to the time when i first knew @entity0			1
he was one of the most amusing , original beings i ever met			0
he was very widely read , but he bore his learning lightly , and he was in no sense a scholar			0
he loved @entity182 ’s @entity181 stories and childish books about @entity185 aeroplanes as much as he loved the highbrow stuff , even though , at his best , he was one of the finest critics of difficult modern poetry i ever read			0
his books were rather waffly			0
they belong to a vanished era of literary criticism and i can not imagine anyone getting anything out of them today			0
however , his conversation could be sublime , whether expounding his reason for loving the novels of @entity200 , the poetry of @entity202 , or the plays of @entity204			0
at the same time , there was a strong element of blarney			0
he was well - known for having ‘ learnt @entity208 ’ , but i remember his face , at a party , when a friend of mine quoted perhaps the most famous lines of the @entity208 poet @entity213 to @entity0			1
the passages about sex in the book were both unconvincing and more than a little bit troubling it was quite clear he had n’t the foggiest what was being said			2
yet he went on to be the judge of the @entity222 ! @entity0 also chaired the @entity224 committee , yet , after stammering out the winner ’s name , he told me he had not actually read the winning entry			1
@entity229 , the narrator in @entity4 ’s novel @entity228 , @entity228 , dreams up some highly distinctive dishes to eat alone , such as braised onions dusted with curry powder and served with a little tomato ketchup ( ‘ only a fool despises tomato ketchup ’ )			1
these odd recipes were all supplied by @entity0			1
in the days of @entity4 ’s health and vigour , dinner with them would include some very weird concoctions — slices of pork pie as a starter , @entity246 for pudding , and chicken scattered with dandelions and curry powder as a main course			2
once we went to supper with them in @entity4 ’s @entity96 flat and four people shared one scrambled egg			2
corned beef in their fridge would quite often be growing a grey mould			0
but those meals were joyous , with lots of cheap wine and whisky			0
even with appalling hangovers the next day , it did not stop one remembering the hilarious , frivolous talk			0
they were both tremendous gossips , but — unlike me , i fear — they were not malicious , and i think @entity0 was right when he used to say that @entity4 never found anyone boring			1
in their heyday they were universally adored			0
i never met anyone who disliked them			0
they seemed like babes in the wood , and their curious partnership — whether or not it had ever possessed a sexual element , and perhaps because it did not — seemed harmonious and fun			0
@entity284 , bespectacled , shambolic , clad in ill - fitting clothes from charity shops , and seldom without a cloth cap , @entity0 was eccentric almost to the point of lunacy			2
at a tea - party at my college , i once saw him stuffing sandwiches and delicate , creamy meringues into his pockets			0
suppers at home often consisted of the fried - up contents of his pockets			0
he was not really able to cope with ‘ normal ’ life			0
@entity0 had a stammer , a very posh voice and had been educated at @entity301			2
harmonious : in their heyday , @entity4 and @entity0 were universally adored and their partnership seemed harmonious @entity0 was terrified of ‘ ordinary people ’			1
once , he found himself opposite one of these frightening beings on the train			0
even worse , the man tried to make conversation			0
‘ now do n’t tell me , ’ said the man			0
‘ i ’d guess you are a lawyer			0
’ ‘ s - s - s - sort of , ’ was @entity0 ’s nervous reply			2
‘ where are you going to ? ’ @entity316 was the real answer , but either because he could not say the word , or because lying came naturally to him , @entity0 answered , ‘ @entity320			2
’ when they reached @entity322 , the man stared at him so hard that @entity0 felt obliged to get out			2
@entity4 , who was waiting anxiously for him on the platform at @entity325 , had no idea where he had disappeared to			2
after @entity4 died in 1999 , @entity0 married their friend @entity327			1
he once said they talked ‘ incessantly about @entity4 ; never stop , really ’			2
i sorely regret , in many ways , having gone public with my feelings of dismay about the memoirs @entity0 had written			2
it still strikes me as weird , even incomprehensible , that he could have written in that humiliating way about @entity4 , and that — conscious or unconscious of his feelings of envy and resentment — he reduced her by writing the books			2
he was furious with me for writing as i did and our friendship was , of course , utterly destroyed			0
this does not prevent me from seeing that , with his passing , we have lost one of the greatest , most glorious @entity348 eccentrics .			0

@entity0 wrote memoir about wife @entity4 ' descent into @entity147 's disease
friends admired the gallant way @entity0 coped with the novelist 's illness
but even before she died he published first book in a trilogy about @entity4
they revealed her *secret* lovers and describe her loss of bodily control
