an @entity1 bus pulling out on to @entity2 in @entity3 is met by the unusual spectacle of a team of horses dragging carriages of freight			2
meanwhile a modern 4x4 is parked just around the corner from a classic @entity12 - in trademark black			2
these evocative images , showing a bizarre clash of past and present , demonstrate beautifully the way our cities have changed with the passage of time - and the ways they have n't			1
past meets present : this image shows a bus pulling on to @entity24 in @entity25 , blended with a team of three horses and carriages bearing goods from the nearby docks classic : this building appears to have remained unchanged , while in the surrounding area modern cars and traffic signs sit incongruously with two classic @entity12 cars to the right the march of time : workers are seen headed in to @entity41 in the older picture , while the area is gated off in the present day created by @entity47 wizard and local historian @entity48 , the collection of images show a blend of scenes past and present in @entity3 and @entity25			1
mr @entity48 , a 46 - year - old postal worker , finds eye - catching images showing his home city in bygone days , then takes his own from the exact same vantage			1
he then digitally blends the two to create an amalgamation of the past and present in a single image			1
he said : ' i do n't look for any type of period really , just if a picture catches my eye and i know the area is still roughly the same i ’ll see if i can create the image , ' said @entity48			1
yesteryear : this composite image shows a goods vehicle emerging from a bustling @entity41 , while a modern car and a cyclist zip by in the present @entity69 : this images superimposes a wedding procession with an everyday pedestrian scene			1
the two images share an overcast sky vintage : an old - time bus and classic cars are seen against the colourful and glass - coated fronts of modern buildings ' i ’ll try and position myself in the exact same spot as the original photographer , capturing the same image but adding something modern to it			1
' once i have the current image i use @entity47 to blend the two images together and begin the process of trying to make it look as authentic as possible , which is sometimes easier said than done			2
' it sometimes takes days to edit the images to perfection , but mr @entity48 believes that the area around @entity25 and @entity3 has remained largely unchanged			1
the city of @entity25 is home to around 210,000 people , and is one of a number of large settlements just outside of @entity3			2
it was an industrial centre in @entity101 times , a period which peaked with the construction of the @entity3 shipping canal , which forms the border with @entity3 proper , in 1894			0
at the time it was the largest shipping canal in the world			0
the city suffered industrial decline throughout the @entity110 , as @entity112 manufacturing moved abroad , but has been regenerated in recent years thanks to projects like the @entity116 's @entity115			0
grand : the @entity119 building , now part of the @entity121 , seems much the same now as it did decades ago memory lane : this old - fashioned parade of shops has been intruded on by two modern vehicles he explained : ' the most striking thing i see in my pictures is times change but the area does n’t			0
' in my area at least , a lot the old buildings still remain			0
' i ’d like to expand this project to other cities as i ’m sure every city has its old buildings and streets that still remain			0
' gone : an old - fashioned tram can be seen making its way down this street , while the overhead wires powering it have disappeared in the recent photograph			0
through the looking - glass : the tower blocks seen on the left of the image would have been new in the early picture , while the bright blue footbridge in the background is a striking contrast to the black - and - white surroundings continuity : this ornate building pictured here still dominates the scene today			0
