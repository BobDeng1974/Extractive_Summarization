life - changing : taking vitamin @entity0 cured @entity2 of her @entity4 symptoms @entity5 was in a work meeting when once again she was gripped by painful stomach cramps			1
' i did n't know whether to make a dash to the bathroom or just sit it out and hope it would pass , ' recalls @entity2 , 43 , a medical librarian , who is divorced and lives in @entity13			1
' i was coping with up to seven bouts of diarrhoea a day and it was really taking its toll on me			0
' i decided to risk it and stay put , but i was concentrating so hard on staying in control that everything being said in the meeting passed over my head			0
' i felt bloated , tired and fatigued			0
my weight was below 7st ( i 'm 5ft 3in )			0
i 'd lost so much weight and looked terrible - i 'm sure people thought i had anorexia			1
it was also making me depressed			0
' i 'd tried every drug , complementary therapy and diet under the sun , some things helped a little but nothing made my symptoms manageable			1
i was just so fed up with being ill all the time			0
' @entity2 , then in her early 30s , had been struggling to cope with irritable bowel syndrome ( @entity4 ) since the age of 13			1
@entity4 is the medical name for a collection of symptoms including abdominal pain and spasms , diarrhoea , constipation or an erratic bowel , bloating , and wind			1
up to a third of the population is thought to have @entity4 at some point , with one in ten experiencing symptoms so severe they seek medical help - @entity4 accounts for a tenth of all visits to gps			1
but the condition is notoriously tricky to diagnose and treat : @entity4 does n't show up on x-rays , blood tests or scans			1
doctors still do n't know what causes it , and unlike other bowel diseases it does not physically damage the gut , yet patients suffer very real symptoms			2
treatment is often a case of trial and error - options include drugs for diarrhoea or constipation , antidepressants , relaxation and psychological therapies , and dietary changes			2
but could vitamin d offer another option ? after years of debilitating symptoms and failed treatments , this is what helped @entity2 , and her experience has now led to a major new study looking at the nutrient 's benefits			1
@entity2 first ' plucked up the courage ' to see her gp in her early 20s			2
' he told me i did have @entity4 and that in my case it was due to stress and advised me to tackle the stress , ' she says			2
' i did n't think i was any more stressed than any of my friends and thought the stress i was under was at least partly due to coping with my ibs			2
i tried meditation , but it made no difference			0
' over the years my ibs left me feeling totally drained			0
' @entity4 : a collection of symptoms including abdominal pain and spasms , diarrhoea , constipation and wind then , in her early 30s @entity2 was finally referred to a gastroenterologist after she broke down in tears at her gp 's because she felt so depressed			1
' i felt i just could n't cope with my symptoms any more			0
' the consultant she saw suggested antidepressants for her depression and anxiety and explained these can have a calming effect on the gut , too			0
' i carried on trying alternative remedies - aloe vera juice , herbal supplements , counselling , hypnotherapy and probiotics to name but a few - but nothing fixed it , ' she says			0
@entity2 's experience is far from unusual , according to dr @entity129 , chairman of the @entity131 's medical advisory group			1
' trying successive treatments is fairly typical as there is n't any one definitive treatment and it 's a matter of deciding what makes most sense and works best for you			0
' @entity4 is most common in women between the ages of 19 and 32			1
' it tends to occur in the more sensitive individuals , who can find themselves overwhelmed with their busy lives , ' says dr read			0
' they tend to blame their diet , but symptoms of @entity4 often start or get worse after a significant change , such as a new job , a holiday , a breakdown of a relationship or the start of a new one , marriage , childbirth , or later , empty nesting , care for elderly parents , bereavement - the stuff of life , ' he says , adding : ' sometimes it follows an attack of food poisoning			1
' such changes and stresses can make the bowel more sensitive to different foods , particularly fats and coffee as these cause the bowel to contract , and milk , wheat , and fruits and vegetables that cause gas			0
' to understand @entity4 , think food and mood , ' says dr read			2
three years ago , @entity2 took to the internet hoping to find a new treatment			2
she teaches medical students how to appraise medical journals and had read many papers in such publications about treatments for @entity4 , but says she ' also wanted to find out what patients were saying about what worked for them '			1
' one thing that kept cropping up online was how high - dose vitamin d supplements could help , ' recalls @entity2			1
' i read one blog then reports from patients on forums talking about this - it was generating a lot of interest			0
' female sufferers : @entity4 is most common in women between the ages of 19 and 32 @entity0 is a fat - soluble vitamin important for bone health , a healthy immune system , muscle growth and blood clotting			1
it is made by the body under the surface of the skin through exposure to sunlight			0
small amounts are contained in dairy products , egg yolks , oily fish and fortified margarine			0
it 's well known that people in the @entity223 and other @entity225 countries have low levels of vitamin d in the winter months			2
increasingly , research is linking a lack of vitamin d to a host of illnesses including inflammatory bowel disease , multiple sclerosis , colorectal cancer and depression			2
based on what she 'd read , @entity2 started a low daily dose of the nutrient ( 1,000 international units ) - she took vitamin @entity241 , a form which comes mainly from plants			1
but it had no effect			0
' then a work colleague who has multiple sclerosis mentioned that vitamin @entity0 from fish oils is closer to the type the body makes naturally and was more effective and should be taken at a higher dose , ' says @entity2			1
' so i switched to 4,000 international units a day of @entity0 , which is a safe dose			2
within days , my symptoms eased and progressively improved over the months			0
' after years of symptoms , my diarrhoea , cramps , pain and bloating disappeared			2
i started to feel well , put on weight and my depression lifted			0
my symptoms would flare up again though , if i forgot to take it			0
' with the help of medical researchers she knew from her work at @entity269 medical school , @entity2 wrote up her experience as a case report for the @entity272 - she included anecdotal reports on vitamin d from blogs , which suggested it worked in 70 per cent of cases			1
the article generated a lot of interest			0
' lots of patients wanted to know more but i knew doctors would n't - quite rightly - recommend vitamin d unless it was backed up by clinical trial evidence , ' says @entity2 , who is now studying for a doctorate based on patient experiences of @entity4			1
now the university 's oncology department is to run a randomised controlled trial of the treatment involving 100 @entity4 patients - half will take a high daily dose ( 3,000 international units ) of vitamin @entity0 , the other half a placebo , for three months			1
a possible cure for the symptoms of @entity4 ? @entity0 ( from fish oils ) is effective ' hopefully this will produce some hard evidence one way or the other , ' says @entity2 , who is a researcher on the trial ( which will soon be recruiting patients )			1
there 's been an ' explosion ' of research into the role of vitamin d in illnesses including cancer multiple sclerosis and inflammatory bowel disease , says dr @entity314 , head of @entity269 's molecular gastroenterology research group			1
' so it is not unreasonable to investigate whether it plays a role in @entity4 , ' he adds			2
there are several ways vitamin d might work , including boosting the immune system and improving the gut 's barrier			1
dr @entity129 says there is evidence some types of @entity4 involve a low level of inflammation in nerve endings in the gut			2
' inflammation around the gut 's nerve cells may make the intestine more sensitive to food and stress , ' he explains			0
' we ca n't say vitamin d works as a treatment for @entity4 yet			1
only a properly designed trial will establish whether it works or not			0
' @entity343 , professor of gastroenterology at @entity345 , @entity346 , agrees the idea that vitamin d may play a role in @entity4 is ' plausible '			1
' we should n't assume it will work , ' he cautions			0
' it could just be the power of placebo			0
