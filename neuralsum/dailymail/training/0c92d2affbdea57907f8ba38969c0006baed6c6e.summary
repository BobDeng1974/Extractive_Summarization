an out - of - court deal has reportedly been agreed between the former head of the @entity8 and @entity9 , 33			1
it is expected the agreement will see her dropping a civil lawsuit she pursued against him after a criminal prosecution collapsed last year			1
loan : with no income or savings , @entity1 will have to ask multi-millionaire heiress @entity19 , his 64 - year - old wife who left him in the summer , for half of the money accuser : @entity9 maintained her claims the she was the victim of a ' violent , sadistic attack , ' despite criminal charges being dropped the @entity27 newspaper @entity26 reported yesterday that the pair would meet a judge in @entity5 next friday to sign the deal			1
' the discussions have been giong on for weeks , months , ' said @entity32 , a friend of @entity1 , 63 , who saw him recently			2
' the agreement should be confirmed at the start of next week			0
we are moving towards the end of a tragedy			0
' @entity26 revealed yesterday that the man once tipped as a future president of @entity27 has turned to his ex-wife , @entity19 , to help him fund the settlement			1
@entity43 has travelled to @entity5 from his home in @entity45 on a number of occasions in the past month to broker the deal with miss @entity9 's representatives aimed at making her ' quietly ' drop her case say friends			2
' according to his confidants , he must give $ 6million ( £ .7million ) to the woman who has accused him of sexual assault , ' @entity26 reported			0
' according to friends , he has confided that he personally does not have this sum			0
' he has therefore told his family that he will be getting a bank loan of $ 3million ( £ 1.8million )			0
' his wife @entity19 , from whom he has been living apart since the summer , should also lend the remaining $ 3million			0
' miss @entity19 , also 63 , a heiress and former television presenter who now runs a @entity45 website , originally put up a £ 624,000 deposit and £ 3.1million bond to get @entity1 out of the notorious @entity65 prison in may 2011 after his arrest at the @entity68 hotel in @entity69			1
at the time , she insisted her husband was innocent , but the pair split up after miss @entity9 's civil case accused @entity1 of a ' violent and sadistic attack , and humiliating and degrading behaviour which was an affront to the dignity of women '			1
battered : @entity1 lost his political career and his job as the head of the @entity8 over allegations he tried to rape a hotel maid the couple who have a daughter @entity83 , had been married for 20 years			1

miss @entity9 alleged that @entity43 forced her to perform a sex act in his suite at the @entity69 hotel on may 14 last year			2
the criminal prosecution fell apart after doubts emerged about her credibility as a witness and the attempted rape charges against @entity1 were eventually dropped			0
he has maintained that the sexual encounter was consensual , although he admitted in a television interview after his return to @entity27 that he regretted his ' moral error '			0
@entity1 filed his own counter-suit against the maid earlier this year , claiming miss @entity9 's accusations had destroyed his career and harmed his reputation			1
the £ 3.7million agreement should mark the end of the sordid saga , although @entity1 's lawyers last night described reports of the settlement as ' fanciful ' .			1

the agreement brokered by lawyers for the 63 - year - old former head of the @entity8 will mark the end of a sordid saga
@entity9 , will 33 , sign a legal agreement dropping a civil law suit against @entity1 , once tipped as a future @entity27 president
may 2011 sex assault *scandal* cost @entity1 his job , his political career and his marriage
