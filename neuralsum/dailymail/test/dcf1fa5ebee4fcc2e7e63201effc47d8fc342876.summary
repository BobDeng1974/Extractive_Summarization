@entity0 , now 73 , was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes by chance in 1999 , aged 58 @entity3 shot to fame in the @entity5 as the original dashing hero @entity6			1
at the time , he was as much a heart throb as @entity8 , star of the hugely successful @entity10 remake of the @entity12 epic that concludes on sunday			2
in fact , even now at the age of 73 @entity0 has retained the physique that helped make him famous - as he showed in a cameo in the @entity10 remake			1
yet even though he has been slim all his life - 12st , which is perfect for his 6ft 1Â½in frame - @entity0 has type 2 diabetes , a condition that many of us associate with being overweight			1
in type 2 diabetes , the body 's cells fail to react to insulin , causing blood sugar levels to soar which , if uncontrolled , can lead to blindness , kidney damage , heart disease and circulation problems , especially in the feet and legs			1
@entity0 was diagnosed by chance in 1999 aged 58 after a friend was diagnosed with prostate cancer and he decided to get himself checked			1
' it was clear , but blood tests showed my blood glucose levels were high , ' he says			0
' six months later , i was tested again and told i had type 2 diabetes			1
' he had none of the tell - tale symptoms such as increased thirst or urination			0
although he had smoked 20 roll - ups a day for 20 years , he gave up when he was 40			0
he was running five or six miles a day , and did n't have a sweet tooth			0
so how did he end up with type 2 diabetes ? normally , it occurs in those who are overweight or who have an inactive lifestyle			1
this is thought to be linked to excess fat cells releasing chemicals that disrupt the way the body responds to insulin			0
however , the problem can also develop in apparently slim people with a normal @entity64 ( @entity64 )			2
that 's because diabetes is strongly linked to visceral fat - which is hidden in the abdomen , around the organs			2
' @entity64 does n't tell the whole story and it 's just as important where the fat is on your body , ' says @entity74 , professor of cardiology at the @entity76			2
' studies show some people can have a normal @entity64 , but a higher proportion of fat than you might expect from looking at them			2
' this does not appear to have been the problem for @entity0			2
he 'd been only too aware of the risks of diabetes - his mother died aged 67 of a heart attack brought on by 30 years of type 1 diabetes			2
pictured here in @entity90 , he was struck by @entity92 's book , dine out and lose weight , which advocates giving up white ( refined ) carbohydrates rather than counting calories ' because of my poor mum 's history , i was fully aware of what my diagnosis meant , ' he says			1
type 2 diabetes has a strong genetic element - if a parent has it , there 's a 50 per cent chance their child will , too			1
however , @entity0 's mother had type 1 diabetes , which is an entirely different type and so it 's likely to be just a coincidence			1
in type 1 diabetes , the insulin - producing cells in the pancreas are destroyed , meaning none is released , whereas in type 2 the pancreas may produce decent levels of insulin but the body is resistant to it			1
the diabetes picture has changed dramatically since @entity0 's mother 's days			1
rates of type 2 diabetes have soared , due to rising obesity levels , and it is being diagnosed at a much younger age			1
in the @entity132 in 2010 there were 3.1 m over- 16s with diabetes , 90 per cent with type 2			1
by 2030 , there are expected to be 4.6 m people with the condition , equivalent to one in ten of the adult population			0
' there is an epidemic of type 2 and the myth that this is a milder form of diabetes has been totally busted , ' says dr @entity145 , consultant diabetes specialist at @entity146 , @entity147			1
indeed while complications such as nerve damage to the eyes and feet equally affect both types of diabetes , damage to the large blood vessels in the heart , brain and legs are far more common with type 2			1
heart disease is a common complication of type 2 diabetes , because high blood sugar can damage the blood vessels and raise the risk of arteries becoming blocked			1
once he was diagnosed , @entity0 was determined to do everything he could to limit the damage through lifestyle changes			1
previously his diet included meals grabbed from the catering truck while filming on location as well as late - night meals with friends while sharing several bottles of wine after coming off stage			0
now , he has eliminated sugar and refined carbohydrates such as white bread from his diet , and developed a passion for cooking from scratch			2
' after being told about diabetes , i read up on it and was struck by @entity92 's book , dine out and lose weight , which advocates giving up white ( refined ) carbohydrates ( that release sugar quickly into the bloodstream ) rather than counting calories			1
i made the changes immediately			0
' @entity0 has since written a number of cookbooks for people with diabetes , as he found there was a lack of recipes available			1
the proportion of hospital beds occupied by patients with diabetes when filming for the current series of @entity90 , he took his own healthy breakfast			2
' i travel with oats , walnuts , dried apricots and prunes to which i add almond milk , which is virtually sugar - free , and then i 'll have rye bread			1
' @entity0 's other lifestyle change was to walk the recommended 150 minutes a week , little but often ( he 'd given up running by then )			1
for ten years he was able to control his blood sugar through these methods alone			0
only recently has he been put on medication , as diabetes is a progressive disease which worsens with age			0
only a minority of patients can combat the disease without drugs for so long			0
' it is achievable , but only in patients who have the knowledge and motivation to do it , ' says dr @entity145			0
six years ago , @entity0 was put on diamicron , a form of sulphonylurea drug , which stimulates the pancreas to produce more insulin			2
three months ago , he was also given januvia , which prevents the breakdown of the gut hormone @entity231 , whose role is to prompt insulin release after a meal			0
two years ago , routine tests indicated that @entity0 had possible artery problems and he was sent to a clinic			2
' i arrived light - hearted as i was n't short of breath or suffering chest pains - and found myself having an angioplasty ( a procedure to widen a blocked artery ) feeling like a chicken on a slab			0
' under local anaesthetic , a catheter was threaded down his arm and a wire then delivered three stents - tiny mesh tubes - to widen the blocked artery			0
' it took no time and i left feeling light - hearted again as it had been fixed			0
but it was further proof that you must take diabetes seriously			0
' since then , all has been well			0
@entity0 - who lives with his @entity261 wife , @entity260 , in @entity262 in south - west @entity263 , does have some numbness in his feet , another common complication of diabetes , and sees a chiropodist every three months			1
' my blood glucose levels are checked every three months , ' he says			0
' there has been a small , steady rise over the years , consistent with my age but still very good			0
' people get depressed and think their diagnosis is the end of the world			0
well , it is n't			0
i 'm still here and i 'm aiming to die of old age , not diabetes			0
