by @entity0 a @entity2 police officer has been suspended pending an investigation into a brawl he had with an alleged speeding driver he recently pulled over who turned out to be his ranking officer			1
officer @entity9 did n't know he was pulling over a fellow cop when he made the traffic stop and was shocked when he says the driver lunged at him and told him to get back in his car			1
the driver turned out to be lieutenant @entity15 with the force 's internal affairs unit			1
despite @entity15 's apparent combativeness toward the uniformed officer , it 's now @entity9 who 's been suspended			1
@entity2 police cruisers are not equipped with cameras and it 's unknown why @entity9 was taking video			1
the footage begins as @entity9 is first pulling over the white @entity42 , whose driver he would later say refused to stop at first			0
when the driver did stop , @entity9 approached the car			1
when he asked for the driver 's license and proof of insurance , the driver appears to fling his car door at @entity9 and lunge			1
@entity9 then easily overpowers @entity15 , and wrestles him to the ground as passing officers swarm and leap atop @entity15			1
that 's when things became awkward			0
video shows the altercation quickly coming to an end , presumably when all the men learn that @entity15 is a fellow cop with over twenty years experience			0
@entity9 , meanwhile , stuck to his guns and suggested in the video that @entity15 was pulling rank on him			2
swarm : the altercation quickly escalates as more passing police swarm to the scene uncomfortable : an awkward moment soon came when all the responding officers realized they 'd pulled over one of their own , a veteran of over 20 years ' i 'm like , i do n't know who you are , @entity77 , ' he said			0
' i do n't care if you 're a lieutenant or whoever you are			0
' but that 's precisely who @entity15 was			0
before the video ends , the lieutenant can be seen phoning someone as the officers linger at the scene			0
and now @entity9 has been suspended as both officers are investigated by @entity2 authorities			2
while @entity15 , unlike his inferior officer , has merely been reassigned and not suspended , the president of the local @entity89 told @entity33 that the law may be on @entity9 's side			2
' @entity93 will tell how this will play out , ' said @entity95			0
' i believe that officer @entity9 was acting in good faith when he pulled over @entity99			1
once the contact was made between the officer and the lieutenant , that â€™s where things get sketchy			0
' @entity9 suggests in the video that @entity15 was attempting to pull rank on him and get out of the ticket			2
@entity109 is now suspended while @entity15 has merely been reassigned			0

@entity2 police officer @entity9 pulled over a speeder as his *personal* @entity36 camera rolled
@entity9 approached the car and the door *suddenly* flung open and the **man** *stepped* out and appeared to argue with @entity9
when the *interaction* turned *physical* , @entity9 flung the **man** to the ground before learning he was lieutenant @entity15
