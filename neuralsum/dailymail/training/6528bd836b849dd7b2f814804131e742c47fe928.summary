@entity0 has gone on the offensive over the @entity3 corruption whitewash by urging world football ’s high command to insist on investigator @entity7 ’s report being published in full			1
the @entity9 chairman says @entity3 can not go on in their present state and full transparency on all bids is ‘ a matter of urgency			1
’ @entity0 ’s letter to 26 members of the @entity17 follows ethics judge @entity18 ’s findings being rubbished by @entity7 himself , causing a meltdown in @entity21			2
@entity9 chairman @entity0 has written to every @entity3 executive committee member about the corruption report @entity0 has every reason to go on the attack as @entity18 ’s conclusions , which cleared @entity27 and @entity28 to stage the @entity29 in 2018 and 2022 , attached most blame for damaging the integrity of the bidding process to @entity33 2018			1
other countries — notably @entity28 and @entity35 — who failed to co-operate with @entity7 were let off almost scot - free			0
@entity0 , who described @entity18 ’s judgement as a joke , says in his letter : ‘ i am writing to each member of the @entity41 to urge you to insist on the publication of mr @entity7 ’s full report as a matter of some urgency			1
‘ as you probably know the reputation of @entity3 was already low in @entity33 and much of @entity51 before the events of last week			0
the failure to publish mr @entity7 ’s report and his statement that the summary report contained “ numerous materially incomplete and erroneous representations ” has resulted in further decline in public confidence of @entity3			2
there have been calls for @entity60 to boycott the 2018 @entity3 , but it will be hosted by a @entity60 member @entity3 president @entity63 previously said criticisms of the organisation were motivated by racism ‘ complete transparency is required if the actions of all those who bid , including @entity33 2018 , are to be judged fairly			2
’ @entity0 , who led the attack against @entity3 president @entity63 before the @entity71 last summer when he accused the @entity73 press of being racist , continued : ‘ i know some of you believe @entity3 ’s reputation in @entity33 is the result of an obsession amongst the @entity73 media with @entity3 , and i know mr @entity63 sees their reports as an unfair attack on the organisation he leads			2
‘ however , if you read a whole range of @entity73 newspaper reports about @entity3 , they do provide compelling evidence of wrongdoing			0
they can not be simply dismissed as “ racist ” or “ an attack on @entity3 ” , as mr @entity63 described them			0
‘ urgent action is needed if confidence in @entity3 is to be rebuilt in @entity33			1
’ @entity96 said the decision to give the @entity98 to @entity27 was ' ludicrous ' there was no reaction at @entity3 to @entity0 ’s broadside			1
they are in unchartered territory with the civil war between their two ethics chambers — investigatory and adjudicatory			0
and fifa can hide behind their lack of comment as @entity7 has started his appeal process of @entity18 ’s alleged misrepresentation of his report , though the pair will meet later this week to sort out their major differences			0
meanwhile , @entity0 ’s predecessor @entity96 has urged @entity51 nations to boycott the 2018 @entity3 unless @entity3 undergoes serious reform			1
he said : ‘ if i was at the @entity9 now , i would do everything to encourage other nations within @entity60 to take this line			0
‘ at some stage you have to do something			0
it sounds drastic but choosing @entity27 was clearly one of the most ludicrous decisions in the history of sport			1
’ to add to the @entity3 fiasco , two minor whistleblowers , @entity130 ’s @entity129 and @entity27 ’s @entity131 , have made a formal complaint to @entity3 that their promises of confidentiality have been breached by @entity18 ’s judgement , claiming it makes them easily identifiable .			0

@entity9 chairman @entity0 has *reiterated* his desire for @entity7 *'s* report into corruption in @entity3 to be published in full
@entity0 has written to every @entity3 executive committee member about it
the former @entity147 boss said ' urgent action ' was required on the matter
