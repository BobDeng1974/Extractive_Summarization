guarding the @entity1 ’s home is a serious and solemn duty			1
so it ’s a good thing her majesty was not around to see this soldier apparently pirouetting on the forecourt of @entity7			1
in his red tunic and bearskin , the @entity8 was filmed seemingly trying to ease the boredom of his two - hour shift with a series of remarkably elegant dance moves			1
he could now face disciplinary action			1
the @entity1 was not in residence at the time as she is currently holidaying in @entity28			2
but a spokesman for the @entity25 confirmed to the mail last night that they were aware of the film and have launched an internal investigation			2
she said : ‘ anyone who is found to fall short of the @entity24 ’s high standards can expect to face appropriate action			1
’ initial enquiries have suggested that the film is not a hoax			2
the three - minute clip was posted online last month and appears to have been filmed recently as a notice advertising the annual @entity41 of the palace ’s @entity42 can be seen in the foreground			1
how about a twirl @entity47 on shoulder , he launched into a pirouette it shows the solider , dressed in his red tunic and bearskin with its white @entity55 plume , attempting to alleviate the boredom of his two - hour guard shift with a series of silly stunts			2
marching up and down , he first bends down to pick up something from the gravel forecourt which he then puts in his pocket			2
he then proceeds to walk very slowly – freezing at one point – before launching into a comical speed walk			2
on his next turn he pretends to polish his guard box with his knuckles as walks past			2
the antics do not end there , however , as the soldier walks with a hip - swinging strut before launching into his tour de force : a series of three , remarkably elegant , pirouettes - not once but twice			1
a group of @entity77 tourists can clearly be heard laughing in the background , marvelling at the guardsman ’s antics			0
one child says : ‘ look at him spinning			0
do you think he will get told off for it by the policeman ? ’ strictly not allowed : dancing on duty , the guard turns his back he then retreats to his box but not before he gestures a thumbs - up to what appears to be his fellow guardsman on the other side of the portico , scratches his nose and leans theatrically to one side			0
although the footage is hugely amusing , a military source said senior officers would take a dim view of the soldier ’s slapstick			1
‘ he is there to guard @entity7 not provide horseplay for tourists , ’ said one yesterday			1
it is likely that he will be either confined to barracks or see his pay docked			0
the @entity8 – motto : @entity116 , shame upon he who thinks evil of it – was formed in 1656 by the exiled @entity117 and are stationed at @entity118 in @entity119			1
it is one of seven regiments that make up the @entity123 , which has provided @entity1 ( or @entity117 ’s ) guard since the @entity125			0
four sentry guards are posted immediately outside the palace when the @entity1 is residence , which is reduced to two when she is at @entity129 or holidaying on one of the estates			0
well , that livened up the day : back at the sentry box a sentry will be on duty at their post for a two hour period			0
every 10 minutes he comes to attention , slopes arms and does a march of 15 paces across the area of the post			0
each sentry will do this four to five times before halting			0
he will then shoulder his arms and stand ‘ at ease ’			0
orders for sentry duty read out before each two - hour ‘ tour of duty ’ , make it clear that : ‘ you may not eat , sleep , smoke , stand easy , sit or lie down during your tour of duty			0
’ members of @entity162 not simply ceremonial soldiers , however			0
as well as providing sentries day and night , they also patrol the grounds of the @entity7			1
like many of their fellow regiments , the @entity8 are also professional infantry soldiers deployed on operations across the globe			1
in a statement the @entity24 told the @entity172 yesterday : ‘ we are aware of the video			0
anyone who is found to fall short of the @entity24 ’s high standards can expect to face appropriate action			1
’ a @entity7 spokesman said : ‘ we have no comment to make			1
it is a matter for the @entity25 and his regiment			0
