by @entity0 @entity1 triumphed in the first four - man play - off in @entity4 history to win his first @entity6 title in the most dramatic fashion on sunday			1
@entity1 , @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10 were all in with a shout of lifting the title after they could not be separated on 19 under par after the final round			1
it took until the fifth extra hole for @entity1 to clinch it , with @entity10 and @entity9 bowing out on the second and fourth extra holes respectively			1
maiden win : @entity1 won the @entity4 for his first victory on the @entity6 eyes on the prize : @entity1 won the @entity4 in the tournament 's first four - man play - off sealed with a kiss : @entity27 celebrated his win with his wife @entity29 at the @entity31 - based tournament @entity33 highlights it means that @entity1 is now the first golfer from @entity35 to win on the @entity6 and improves his previous best finishes of runner - up in the 2009 @entity38 , 2010 @entity39 and 2012 @entity40			1
@entity9 would have been the favourite in many eyes going into the titanic play - off tussle after notching an eagle and a birdie on the 17th and 18th holes already on sunday			2
but @entity1 was the only player out of the four leaders to avoid carding a bogey in the fourth round and he maintained that statistic when it mattered most			0
' i have really been playing very well in the last few weeks so i knew that if i had a good round i would have a good chance , ' he told @entity54			0
' i have been working a lot and trying to bring up my confidence to get to this moment and finally i am here			0
' winning smile : @entity1 ( front ) was the only player out of the four leaders to avoid carding a bogey on sunday world number two @entity8 had looked to be in control on the first extra hole , with a birdie in sight , but he missed to keep all four men in the hunt			2
if the @entity68 was stewing over that opportunity as he walked back to the 18th tee he did not show it , finding an unlikely birdie to once again put the pressure on his rivals			0
@entity75 became the first casualty , but the other two men rose to the challenge			0
@entity8 , who won the @entity4 via a play - off in 2006 , looked like he knew exactly what was required to win on the third extra hole , putting himself in position to make an eagle			1
but he just missed his putt and all three men birdied as rain started lashing down			0
close but no cigar : @entity8 was one of three golfers to lose to @entity1 in the four - man play - off the start in @entity31 had been brought forward due to forecasts for storms and there were fears it might interrupt the thrilling climax at one point			1
@entity9 - @entity9 finally cracked on the fourth extra hole , finding the lake to bow out , while this time it was @entity1 's turn to wobble and miss a birdie opportunity after @entity8 pitched to within a few feet of the pin from a difficult position			1
back on the 18th , @entity8 followed @entity9 into the water while @entity1 fell short of the green but , crucially , managed to stay dry			2
@entity107 landing : @entity108 attempts to play a ball out of a bunker at the @entity4 @entity8 finally conceded after he was unable to make his shot from bunker fall to prompt celebrations from @entity1			1
@entity115 @entity114 fell just short of getting involved in the exciting finale as he finished on 18 under par overall			0
@entity114 carded seven birdies in a fine fourth round , but was made to rue a bogey on the 12th hole that meant the play - off was agonisingly out of reach			2
sweet swing : @entity125 plays an approach shot to the second green during his fourth round on sunday he was joined by @entity130 @entity129 , who continued his fine form over the weekend with five birdies in a blemish - free final round			0
overnight leader @entity134 slipped off the pace , dropping his first shots of the weekend with two bogeys on the ninth and 14th holes , as he fell two shots behind the four - strong leading pack .			0
