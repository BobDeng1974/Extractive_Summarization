@entity7 developers @entity8 have announced that @entity9 is making a return on all major consoles – and will be a launch title for the @entity13			1
great fun : it may not boast eye - popping visuals , but @entity9 oozes character regarded by many as one of the best games of its time , you play an unlikely hero called @entity24 – out to rescue his kidnapped friends			1
thankfully , @entity24 has a variety of abilities to help him along the way			0
he can stretch to reach items and drop to areas below him			0
he can also lie flat to avoid enemies and absorb items that can be used at a later date			0
then there 's the attack move , where @entity24 makes a fist to bash enemies , and if it all gets too much , he can inflate and soar to previously out - of - reach areas			2

it ’s helped by some vibrant visuals , too			0
although its side - scrolling nature puts a limit on all - out graphical quality – it ’s still incredibly pleasing on the eye			1
environments are varied enough to stave off monotony – ranging from @entity72 tombs to scary laboratories			0
