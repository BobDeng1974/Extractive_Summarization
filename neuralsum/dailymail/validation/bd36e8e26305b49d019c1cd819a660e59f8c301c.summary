the @entity0 are going back to the @entity1 this spring – onstage , that is			2
' @entity6 , ' the brainchild of two @entity5 brothers , makes its off - @entity8 debut in april with a hysterical premise and a gentle look back at the ' 90s			1
the play celebrates the first baby - boomer president – the one who preferred briefs to boxers , played a sax on national tv , presided over an economic boom and got himself impeached			1
the cast of characters includes @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 and former @entity6 special prosecutor @entity24 , who sings ' a @entity25 ' and ' sexual relations			1
' ' @entity6 the musical ' stars @entity29 ( left ) as the wholesome and intelligent @entity30 , @entity31 ( right ) as the sex - crazed ' @entity30 , ' and @entity33 ( center ) as @entity35 – the only person who can see both of them @entity38 , she 's there too : @entity23 ( left ) , the president 's @entity1 - intern lover , makes appearances in ' @entity6 ' @entity43 ? as @entity35 ( left ) prepares to run for president , her husband 's legendary sexual appetite could come back to haunt her ' the thing that endeared @entity30 and continues to endear him to the @entity50 public is that he was a very identifiable human being , ' said @entity52 , who wrote the music and lyrics and co-wrote the story			1
' he was clearly human and he had flaws like everyone			0
' there 's a dancing press corps in the show , and music that takes you back to @entity64 , @entity65 and the @entity66			1
' it really does its job of taking down @entity50 and uplifting it at the same time , in a weird sort of way , ' said @entity71 , the @entity72 - nominated director and choreographer			0
' two men will play the 42nd president – one a wholesome , intelligent @entity6 , and another a randy , rogue one ( @entity29 and @entity31 share the task			1
) only @entity35 can see both			1
that bifurcated idea was first proposed by @entity80 , @entity52 's older brother , a lawyer in @entity5 , who co-wrote the story and now consults daily with his brother via @entity83 on last - minute changes			2
' it seemed like a good device to sum up a very complicated man but also something that had a lot of opportunity for humor , and also something that allowed us to tell a story that everyone knows in way that they do n't know , ' said @entity52 , a ph.d. candidate in musical composition at the @entity99			0
no ' @entity100 ' ? it 's unclear whether @entity30 accusers @entity102 ( left ) , @entity103 ( center ) and @entity105 ( right ) made any apearances in the new off - broadway production @entity33 , the @entity72 - nominated star of ' @entity108 , ' will play @entity35 just as the former secretary of state debates whether to run her own presidential campaign in 2016			1
the @entity52 brothers kept an eye on @entity35 's career as they wrote the show , reworking her part and throwing in topical humor , like jokes about her email			1
' that 's part of the fun of doing something that 's set in the past where people know what 's going to happen in the future but the characters in the past do n't know what 's going to happen , ' said @entity52 , 27			2
' that 's an opportunity for comedy			2
' the show was first presented in a shortened form at the @entity133 in 2012 , before playing the @entity134 last year			1
it opens off - @entity8 at @entity136 on april 9			1
the @entity52 brothers have been adding and shaping the show , and only two songs remain from the fringe show			2
characters have also been deepened			0
' there was not enough @entity24			2
you can never get enough @entity24 , ' @entity52 joked			2
@entity30 's tenure was highlighted by a failed health care reform plan and record budget surpluses			0
he faced constant scandals , capped by an affair with a @entity1 intern that made him just the second president to be impeached			0
the show notes that the @entity6 presidency also coincided with the start of the cable boom and the 24 - hour news cycle , developments that have buffeted the leaders who follow			1
' i think it was a time when the distance between the public and the presidency evaporated , ' said @entity52 , whose humor is rooted in shows like ' @entity165 , ' '' @entity166 , ' '' @entity157 ' and ' the @entity167			0
' ' a @entity168 is born ' : an actor portraying independent counsel @entity24 ( left ) makes an appearance in the show , along with the president 's ' i did not have sexual relations with that woman ' moment ( right ) the idea of making a musical about the @entity6 presidency came about a decade ago when the @entity52 brothers saw ' @entity178 ! , ' a musical about @entity5 prime minister @entity178			1
they went with their dad , @entity180 , who afterward commented : ' it 's good , but i do n't think politicians make great subject matter for musicals , except maybe @entity30			0
' ' we went , ' of course ! '' @entity52 said			0
the brothers insist they have no domestic political axe to grind , seeing as they are @entity5 citizens			0
they wanted simply to see the president as a flesh - and - blood man			0
' i admire @entity30 , ' @entity52 said			0
' he 's a very complicated person , but i think we all are			0
my view of all of the people involved in the story is that they 're all very complicated human beings			0

two men will play the 42nd president : one portraying him as wholesome and intelligent , and another as a *lascivious* rogue
only @entity35 can see both
cast includes actors playing @entity6 *adviser* @entity21 , @entity23 , @entity22 and independent counsel @entity24 – who argued for the president 's impeachment
@entity24 sings songs titled ' a @entity25 ' and ' @entity211 '
show opens april 9 , and features a dancing press corps
