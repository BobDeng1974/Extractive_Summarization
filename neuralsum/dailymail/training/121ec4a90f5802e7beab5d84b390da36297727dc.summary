‘ his earlier equalising header in that @entity61 final was his 157th goal in 341 appearances , a total placing him fourth in the club ’s all - time highest - scorer list			2

i am excited for this next chapter of my career			0
’ @entity7 will play the role of understudy to new signing @entity108 but the @entity111 star is sure to be impressed by his new colleague ’s record at @entity114 — not least the 34 goals in @entity81 competition that remains a @entity3 record , and the nine strikes in nine cup finals			1
in eight years he won three @entity30 titles , four @entity121 , two @entity122 and the @entity61			0
