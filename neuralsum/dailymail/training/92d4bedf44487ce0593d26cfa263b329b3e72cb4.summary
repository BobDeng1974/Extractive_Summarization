by @entity0 published : 14:50 est , 8 august 2013 updated : 15:16 est , 8 august 2013 claims : healthcare assistant @entity2 says she was bullied by colleagues for six months after raising concerns about nursing practices a hospital whistleblower who claims she was bullied by colleagues after raising concerns about nursing practices was offered just 56 pence in compensation to settle her case , a court heard			1
healthcare assistant @entity2 , 58 , is attempting to sue @entity12 for £ 185,000 in damages claiming she was subjected to six months of victimisation			1
she says she reported a nurse for taking just four - and - a - half hours break between shifts believing it was putting patients at risk			1
‘ the whistleblowing letter was written out of concern at the fact she finished her night shift at 7.30am and was rostered to start a bank shift at noon , ' she told @entity26			2
‘ i felt what she was doing was irresponsible behaviour , and in the letter i described it as extremely dangerous			2
’ mrs @entity2 told the court that as a result of the letter she was made to appear before a disciplinary panel			1
she said she was exonerated at her subsequent disciplinary hearing , while the allegations against the nurse were upheld			1
but mrs @entity2 alleges senior managers instructed colleagues to alienate and bully her as a result			1
she resorted to secretly recording conversations with colleagues in a bid to prove she was being victimised			2
‘ there was alienation , bullying , harassment , and victimisation , and i did have the tapes ’ , she said			0
‘ i had them transcribed by a court preferred company , and the keywords are all there - evil , manipulative , bully , harassment , and liars			0
‘ the point i am making is under the whistleblowing policies , i should n’t have been subjected to six months of repercussions			0
' mrs @entity2 was offered a settlement by the hospital of just 56p , and is now putting this forward as part of her collection of grievances			1
dispute : senior managers at @entity12 instructed colleagues to alienate mrs @entity2 following her whistleblowing letter , a court heard mrs @entity2 , who is now on antidepressants , says she tried to sort her complaints through human resources , @entity75 , and with her union , before taking the hospital to tribunal			1
she lodged an official grievance in november 2009 and forced the hospital to appoint an independent assessor to look at her claims , but said the subsequent report clearing health bosses was ‘ completely farcical ’			2
the hospital , which is contesting the allegations , says proper procedures were followed in dealing with mrs @entity2 ’s complaints			1
the independent inquiry found the whistleblowing procedures had not been correctly followed , but supported the outcomes of the disciplinary hearings			0
the report also noted that mrs @entity91 had not helped her feeling of becoming isolated from colleagues by secretly taping their conversations			0
it also found no evidence of intimidation or bullying			0
mrs @entity2 has ploughed ahead with the tribunal despite being warned by a judge last year that she has very little chance of winning			2
judge @entity102 , assessing the case last year , ordered the healthcare assistant to pay a £ 1,000 deposit to bring the case to tribunal because he believed she should drop her claims			0
he told her : ‘ i really do not think you have a good chance of succeeding , i think you have little prospect of success			0
‘ if you fail , the respondents will undoubtedly make an application for costs and the tribunal , in deciding whether to order costs will look at this judgement and the fact that you were ordered to pay a deposit			0
’ he warned mrs @entity2 , who earns £ 26,000 a year working at the hospital , that she could face a hefty costs bill if the tribunal rules against her			1
the hearing , which will sit next week , continues .			0
