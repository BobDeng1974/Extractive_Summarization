by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor by selling the @entity4 , vendors can register as self - employed and claim benefits , @entity2 said selling the @entity4 is being used by poor eastern @entity7 as a fast - track route to claiming benefits in @entity10 , @entity2 has warned			1
becoming a vendor of the magazine for homeless people allows people to register as self - employed , and claim working tax credits			1
the @entity16 said the loophole was being used ‘ more and more ’ , with a warning that benefits tourism applied to those in work as well as the jobless			1
the government wants to tighten rules on when migrants can claim benefits after arriving in @entity10			1
at the start of the year new rules were introduced banning claims for the first three months , but senior @entity30 want to go much further			0
most of the focus has been on migrants claiming @entity34 and other out - of - work benefits instead of moving to the @entity10 for in search of a job			1
but speaking in @entity38 , mr @entity2 said there are growing concerns about the abuse of in - work benefits			1
answering questions after delivering a speech on welfare reform , the conservative cabinet minister said there was a perception which has a ‘ core element of truth ’ that people arriving in the @entity10 ‘ find themselves drifting in and out of benefits ’			2
he added : ‘ a good example of that is the @entity4 , a magazine which is a brilliant idea by a brilliant individual who himself was homeless			0
‘ but actually what is happening progressively , more and more , is people mostly from southern and eastern @entity7 have actually ended up being @entity4 sellers and they claim , as self - employed , immediately , tax credits , ’ the @entity59 reported			1
‘ so when we talk about benefits , they are not just out - of - work benefits , they are also in - work benefits that are being claimed			2
‘ @entity68 have been claiming those for some time now , regardless of when they came in			2
we had a reasonable influx of @entity68 long before we opened the doors on january 1			2
‘ they came in on the self - employment level and that is an issue that needs to be dealt with			0
so [ when ] i talk about benefit tourism in a sense , we are talking about in - work benefit tourism			0
’ the @entity16 said he wanted to tackle the perception of benefit tourism , including among those in work the remarks followed a controversial speech in which he hit out at the @entity84 for telling us ‘ we will have to pay benefits to anyone who comes here from @entity7 , regardless of their circumstances ’ , and that doing otherwise is ‘ akin to xenophobia ’			2
he said the government had already banned new migrants from claiming housing benefit and stopped them from getting unemployment or family support until they have been living in the @entity10 for at least three months			0
migrants without work are also now required to prove they can speak @entity101 and that they will be able to get a job in order to claim			0
but mr @entity2 said @entity10 wanted to go further , and demanded ‘ the right to say to migrants that we require a much longer record of commitment before you get benefits and shortening the duration of any benefit claim that is allowed ’			1
however , in response to his claims about the @entity4 , the magazine insisted that the ‘ problem is the government 's and not one of [ our ] making ’			0
‘ in the meantime , it is wrong to promote the idea that the @entity4 is doing anything nefarious or harmful in adding to a problem which is not of its making , ’ a spokesman said			0
the @entity128 said it was already taking action to deal with the @entity4 loophole , insisting claimants must earn a minimum £ 153 - a - week .			0
