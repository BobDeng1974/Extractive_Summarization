is it a boat or is it a plane ? well , it 's both , and a sensational way to see the northern coast of @entity5			2
this ' flying boat ' , as it 's known , operates out of @entity7 and is somewhere between a seaplane , a paraglider and a hang glider			1
starting on flat ocean water the boat is only a boat for moments , as it picks up speed and takes to the sky courtesy of its hang glider wing			1
from that point it can cruise in the air to wherever the passenger desires , whether it be a joy ride around the beautiful beaches of the area such as @entity24 and @entity25 or a return trip to the towns of @entity28 to the north or @entity30 to the west			2
not just reliant on the breeze , a 70 horsepower engine also helps the pilot stay in control			0
while the gentle noise of the engine interrupts the serenity somewhat , the freedom it offers makes the many pleasure boats that charter the waters here look positively ill - equipped			0
unsurprisingly , it 's not exactly a cheap exercise , with a 30 - minute return journey to @entity49 setting visitors back 120 euro ( £ 74 ) or a flight to somewhere such as @entity30 costing 200 @entity52 ( £ 124 ) per hour			0
an extra 30 @entity52 ( £ 18.50 ) immortalises the view in video form on a memory stick			0
