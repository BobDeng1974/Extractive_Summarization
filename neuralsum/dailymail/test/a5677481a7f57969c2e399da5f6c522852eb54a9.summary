the @entity0 has been told it must pay the @entity1 thousands of pounds if it wants to serve the cakes to 5,000 women attending centenary celebrations at the venue in june it ’s been a gargantuan undertaking , even by the formidable standards of the @entity0			1
for days on end , two of its members slaved away baking enough cakes to feed 5,000 women attending the @entity0 ’s centenary celebrations at the @entity1 in june			1
but the @entity0 has now been told it must pay the venue thousands of pounds to serve the cakes			1
‘ it ’s outrageous , ’ said one @entity0 stalwart , who did not wish to be named			1
‘ we ca n’t waste money on this			0
i do n’t understand why they just wo n’t let us give it away			0
’ @entity25 , 35 , a member of her local @entity0 group in @entity28 , @entity29 , added : ‘ it seems rather petty			1
' the @entity0 is a charity and i would have thought the @entity33 could have come to an amicable arrangement			2
’ the idea was that the 5,000 members attending the @entity37 of the @entity0 ’s @entity38 , which this year celebrates the anniversary , would find a box of centenary cake on their seats			1
but organisers were astonished to be told that the gesture would incur a ‘ sampling charge ’ of £ 2,500 because the centenary cake has fallen foul of the @entity33 ’s sponsorship rules			2
even though the fruitcake has been home - made by two @entity0 star bakers , some of the ingredients were donated by companies including @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity56 , and their contribution is acknowledged on the cake boxes			1
under the @entity33 ’s booking conditions , extra fees are liable if products of commercial sponsors are promoted inside the building			1
to avoid the unexpected cost , members will now be given a piece of the cake to eat on the way home , instead of at the venue			0
a @entity0 spokeswoman said : ‘ once we considered the logistics , we decided it would be easier all round to give every federation their “ pieces ” to distribute after the meeting			2
’ the @entity1 declined to confirm the amount of the extra cake charge - but under the @entity33 ’s booking conditions , extra fees are liable if products of commercial sponsors are promoted inside the building baking the 44 @entity0 fruitcakes used more than five stone of butter , several hundred eggs and enough rum to paralyse a fleet of pirate ships			1
here ’s what it took in total : the @entity1 declined to confirm the amount of the extra cake charge			0
but a spokeswoman said : ‘ @entity95 charges a fee for sponsors ’ commercial products to be promoted within the building			1
the @entity0 informed us that their requirements had changed and the product will no longer be consumed on the premises			2
therefore no fee will apply			0
’ the cakes ’ creation has been a military exercise for retired home economics teachers , @entity109 , 72 , a dairy farmer ’s wife from @entity111 , @entity112 , and @entity113 , 75 , from @entity114 , @entity115			0
they spent 11 full days last month baking 44 12 x 12in cakes 3.5in deep between them			0
divided up , this provides enough cake for the 5,000 members			0
miss @entity121 said : ‘ we ’ve been very careful with costing			0
we used cheap flour and bought eggs in bulk			0
if we had n’t had some donations , it would have cost about £ 1,100			0
’ the pair followed a recipe chosen following a competition for the @entity0 ’s 200,000 - plus members won by @entity131 , 66 , from @entity132 , @entity112 , who is chairman of the @entity0 ’s @entity133 .			2
