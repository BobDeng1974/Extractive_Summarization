by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 _ the @entity2 has seen some fantastic games and goals but perhaps just as notably , some brilliantly funny moments			2
here , @entity6 looks at the top 10 things that got people laughing in @entity9 and at home			2
@entity12 's big slip as @entity15 ’s strike thundered off the top of the crossbar , @entity13 manager @entity12 bizarrely gave the illusion that he was fainting , careering backwards towards the dugout and having to be caught by a member of his backroom staff			1
the 59 - year - old , closed his eyes , leaned back , and collapsed backwards to produce one of this tournaments most bizarre moments			0
frustration : @entity12 closes his eyes and begins to lean back after @entity15 smashes the bar too far : @entity12 continues on his way backwards and begins to lose his balance spin : @entity12 begins to hurtle towards the dugout as he falls down the gap behind the pitch smash : @entity35 continues his assault on @entity12 in this meme as he forces his up off the ground with a punch walking the plank : @entity12 is depicted as doing a bungee jump from a high crane @entity45 's terrible free kick as four players stood over the ball , it appeared that the @entity49 had a subtly designed routine in place to surprise @entity52 in the round of 16 clash			2
however , the scheme ( and @entity56 ) fell flat on its face as the @entity49 stumbled and collapsed head - first onto the turf as he attempted to dummy the ball , with team - mate then chipping the ball straight to the @entity52 defence			0
defender @entity64 claimed after the match that the stumble was all part of the masterplan : ‘ we practiced that free - kick in training			0
the final chip was n’t quite right ’			0
we do n’t doubt you for a moment , @entity64 …			2
one : @entity56 begins his run - up for the free kick two : but after @entity76 steps over the ball , @entity56 falls to the floor three : @entity56 crawls a couple of steps and then launches himself back up , over the ball floor : he runs away from the ball , into the box , but the free kick taker can not find him five : @entity56 speeds off , much to the bemusement of those watching at home &amp; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; lt ; br / &amp; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; gt ; @entity106 's big celebration slip with the eyes of the world watching on , falling flat on your backside is never the most advisable course of action			1
but that ’s the fate that befell @entity9 ’s golden boy @entity106 , as he sprinted over to celebrate @entity116 ’s opening goal against @entity117 in the @entity2 quarter - final			1
his team would go on to win the tie but the match ended in heart - breaking fashion for the @entity125 man , as a brutal challenge by @entity127 left him the @entity128 with damaged vertebrae			0
poised : @entity9 team - mates gather in the corner after taking the lead against @entity117 on friday disappearing act : @entity106 ( left ) slips as he goes to join his team - mates in celebrating the opening goal @entity136 and the giant grasshopper it sounds like the sequel to a @entity141 novel but there was no happy ending for the brilliant @entity144 as the star of this @entity2 headed out of the competition despite scoring a penalty against @entity9			1
his @entity117 side were defeated 2 - 1 by in the quarter - final on friday night despite his late consolation goal , which was most memorable for the giant green insect that perched on his sleeve as he coolly tucked away the spot - kick			0
after setting @entity158 ’s @entity157 and @entity159 onto @entity144 , even @entity9 ’s nipping grasshoppers could n’t prevent the playmaker having a say on this quarter - final			0
incoming : the green bug can be seen flying towards @entity144 during the @entity2 quarter - final on target : the insect finds its mark on @entity144 's arm and attaches itself to @entity117 's @entity169 look closely : you can see the invader clinging to @entity144 's sleeve as he celebrates his penalty @entity174 5 misses from @entity2 qualifying @entity177 plays it cool with @entity179 we 've all been there			1
offering your hand out for the respect you deserve , before having to style out that rejection seconds after			0
this was the case for the linesman in the tunnel as a dignitary greeted the officials and the captains ahead of @entity193 ’s group stage defeat against @entity194			2
in fairness , he recovered swiftly , swiping his hand across his head before sharing a joke with @entity193 goalkeeper @entity179			0
ouch : the linesman his snubbed for a handshake ahead of the @entity193 vs @entity194 game super cool : he tries to style it out , rubbing his head instead sympathy : @entity193 goalkeeper has a laugh with the linesman after the incident @entity211 's oversized mascot poor old @entity211 is only 5 foot 6 inches , so it seemed a little cruel when @entity213 assigned the tallest mascot to the @entity215 ahead of the quarter - final against @entity45			1
the midfielder just about peers above the young boy and he will have felt particularly perturbed to see the commanding midfielder @entity220 paired with the smallest mascot			0
not much difference : @entity211 ( left ) had a mascot almost as tall as him against @entity45 @entity224 : internet pranksters swapped the heads of @entity211 and his mascot around @entity229 's ridiculous biting defence memo to @entity229 : if you ’re going to sink your teeth into an opponent , you probably should n’t give the game away by then clutching your jaw in pain			1
you ’d have think he ’d have learned by the third time			0
this image , one of the defining moments of the tournament , also left @entity229 ’s post-match comments rather flawed , as the @entity245 complained : ‘ i had contact with his shoulder , chest against shoulder and i got a knock to the eye – nothing more			1
’ bite night ! @entity254 writhes on the floor after the clash with @entity229 not fooling anyone : @entity229 holds his teeth after appearing to sink them into the shoulder of the @entity261 cover up ! @entity262 holds his face to suggest that he had only collided with @entity254 cover up ? @entity229 holds his teeth in pain after the incident suggesting he collided with @entity254 @entity267 reading death in @entity9 after @entity269 collapsed to their worst @entity2 performance for 58 years , @entity268 chairman @entity267 could hardly have picked a more painfully appropriate title than @entity273 ’s ‘ a death in @entity9 ’			1
the increasingly erratic @entity268 chief was pictured reading the book just days after @entity269 ’s exit had been confirmed following defeats by @entity278 and @entity279 in the group stage			1
engrossed : @entity268 chairman @entity267 was seen reading ' a @entity272 in @entity9 ' ahead of @entity269 's training session time out : @entity269 were training in @entity283 ahead of the game against @entity285 keen reader : sir @entity287 also seemed interested in @entity267 's book @entity291 's @entity290 impression @entity291 and @entity290 : two names you thought you ’d never hear in the same sentence			1
well , at least until the @entity296 manager appeared on the @entity297 in a skimpy pair of sky blue swimming trunks and paraded down the beach to perform his finest baywatch impression			0
the 62 - year - old looked in fine fettle and then demonstrated his athleticism with a game of beach football , replicating @entity308 ’s magnificent diving header against @entity193 to wow the locals			0
who 's that ? a male figure starts to emerge from the choppy waters on @entity315 beach is it @entity317 ? despite wearing similar trunks to @entity290 ( right ) it is actually @entity291 ( left ) on my head : @entity291 plays a game of volleyball on the beach in @entity9 airtime : @entity291 flings his legs in the air , resembling @entity308 's header against @entity193 @entity329 squirting @entity12 with speculation that @entity12 was struggling to command the respect of the @entity13 dressing room , @entity329 added fuel to the fire by squiring his gaffer with water as the coach attempted to remonstrate with him during the 3 - 2 win over @entity339			1
between taking swigs from a water bottle @entity329 - with his back to @entity12 - appeared to intentionally squirt water over his shoulder and on to the @entity13 boss ’ suit			2
between swigs : @entity329 squirts some water over his shoulder in flight : the stream of water arcing towards @entity13 boss @entity12 making a splash : the water hits @entity12 on the top of his head			2

@entity291 's bond moment and @entity106 's slip had people *giggling*
@entity229 , @entity329 and a cool linesman also make our list
@entity211 and @entity268 chairman @entity267 did not escape ridicule
