by @entity1 reporter last updated at 2:42 pm on 9th december 2011 plastic manhole covers are being trialled in a drastic move by a local authority after scrap metal thieves stripped an area of the traditional road coverings			1
councillors in @entity9 have ordered the trial after scores of the covers were stolen earlier this year			1
the move comes as scrap metal theft reaches almost epidemic proportions across the @entity15			1
plastic replacement : the cheaper covers are being tested in @entity9 following a spate of thefts nineteen manhole and drain covers , which are made out of wrought iron and cost an average £ 4000 , were stolen in just 48 hours across @entity9 in march			1
the new plastic replacements cost only £ 400 and are built to last for 15 years where their metal counterparts require replacement after five years			1
@entity28 is now working with motorcyclists in the @entity31 area to determine whether the plastic anti-skid cover are a safe alternative			1
@entity28 spokesman , @entity34 , said : ' we are trialling a new type of cover in one location in @entity31			0
it is made of plastic and is anti-skid			1
' we are now working with a local motorcycle group to monitor and get feedback from the group into the performance of the cover over the coming months			0
metal target : manhole and drain covers are being stolen countrywide as the cost of scrap metal rises ' the new covers are also less likely to be stolen as they have no scrap value			1
we are trialling one of the plastic covers and if this proves successful , we would hope to use them in other areas across the district			1
' local residents have also complained that the covers at @entity61 in @entity62 have yet to be replaced despite them being stolen nine months ago			2
the council has cordoned off the area around the missing covers to warn drivers and pedestrians , but residents say work needs to be done urgently to replace them			1
some councils have reported the theft of manhole covers , wheelchair ramps and even children 's playground equipment			2
rail companies are having power and signalling equipment stolen on a daily basis across the network with @entity80 admitting number of thefts ' is huge '			0
as police admit they are failing to keep up with the thefts around the country sparked by the global rise in metal prices there is growing pressure on the government to reform the 1964 @entity91			2
the coalition is considering licensing scrap metal dealers , banning them from dealing in cash and giving police powers to close rogue traders down			2
ministers are considering the crackdown on the industry worth £ 5bn a year to the economy			2
it is thought that more than 15,000 tonnes of metal is stolen in the @entity15 each year			0
one resident said : ' there is no street lighting to speak of along @entity61 and to have these open manholes surrounded by barriers in the @entity108 is a safety hazard			0
one of the cordons is just around a blind bend and when you come around the corner you are on top of it before you have noticed			0
' i would n’t have thought it would have taken more than six to eight weeks to order replacements and get them fitted			0
' i believe there are some concerns about the fitting of these manholes because of the utilities which may be under the road			0
' but other companies seem to manage to carry out work without these problems , so why ca n’t @entity28			0
i am concerned that nine months on , these covers have not been replaced			0
' mr @entity34 said the covers were being replaced but there had been delays because surveys needed to be carried out first			0
the metal covers need to be drilled into the road surface and sometimes cables and pipes lie underneath			1
the council is also appealing to anyone who sees anything suspicious to report it immediately to the police .			0
