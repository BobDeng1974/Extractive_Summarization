when renowned hard - man @entity1 admits to being taken aback at the levels of violence that @entity5 team - mate @entity4 was capable of when they were part of the club ’s notorious @entity8 in the 1980s , you are not surprised to hear the powerful striker and former host of hit tv show gladiators was no bleeding heart liberal			1
nevertheless , it is shocking — and doubtlessly refreshing to some — to hear the man once dubbed ‘ @entity16 ’ not only defending his behaviour more than 25 years ago , but also regretting that modern football and society in general has gone soft in a way that prevents people like him ‘ rising from the gutter into fame and fortune ’ , as he puts it			2
@entity4 , 52 , last week travelled from @entity27 where he is a successful businessman , to @entity28 for the premiere of a tv documentary on the @entity8 , to be screened on @entity31 on @entity32			1
@entity4 is restrained by the referee during a match between @entity5 and @entity35 former @entity5 duo @entity4 and @entity1 ( right ) embrace after @entity1 rejoined the club in 1992 @entity4 , who used to present tv show @entity37 , is now a successful businessman in @entity27 it charts the rise of @entity5 from a non-league club to winning the @entity42 in 1988			1
some of the stories are hair - raising			2
@entity1 , whose tough - guy reputation saw him forge a @entity47 career , described one dressing - room fight : ‘ @entity49 literally lifted him up , swung him around and smashed him down on the floor and his calf just obliterated			1
’ @entity4 revels in ruling by fear and admitted : ‘ there were times when we were 200 per cent physical			1
we believed we were warlords because at three o’clock on a saturday , it was war			2
’ former @entity5 owner @entity60 and ex-manager @entity61 have condemned the film for focusing on the violence rather than the club ’s amazing rise from the @entity66 to playing the likes @entity68 and @entity69			1
' @entity16 ' , as he was known , grabs the throat of @entity71 as tempers flare @entity1 ( left ) , @entity60 ( centre ) and @entity4 celebrate after a match against @entity68 @entity4 says it is wrong to suggest that @entity5 were only about bullying but in an exclusive interview with the @entity78 , he refused to apologise for the way he behaved — and for maintaining some strong views that , in today ’s society , are very controversial			1
referring to himself in the third person , he describes life at a club he joined from @entity87 in 1986			2
‘ @entity49 was a physical bastard and you would either have to adapt or dissolve as a person , ’ he declares			2
‘ the players ran the club and if you were a wise manager , you would work with us , not against us			2
’ discipline was enforced by kangaroo courts , chaired by @entity1 and @entity4 , ruling on anything from timekeeping to dress code			1
@entity99 defender @entity98 was left with a fractured skull after a clash with @entity4 in 1993 @entity98 lays on the ground ( centre ) after clashing with @entity5 's @entity4 and sustaining fractured skull ‘ the @entity5 players did n’t have money at that stage , we could n’t fine you , so the best we could do is beat the crap out of you			1
‘ that is how we got our success			1
we are not here to apologise , we are here to tell you how it worked			2
‘ once , one of our lads would n’t pay a fine , @entity1 and @entity119 ( @entity120 ) went to get him , i locked the door of the changing - room and when the door is locked , it is only me , him and @entity126 who knows what ’s happened			1
but i assure you , you come out looking different than when you went in			2
‘ people will now go , “ well , that was too much intimidation ”			2
i ’m sorry , in the world we were living in then , it was part of the qualities of leadership , intimidation			2
’ @entity4 was an intimidating figure to both the opposition and his own team - mates , it has been revealed referee @entity140 gets an earful from @entity142 and @entity143 during a win against @entity145 dressed in an expensive suit and delighted to be around former team - mates like @entity148 , @entity149 and @entity143 , the gregarious @entity4 does not now carry an air of malice			1
a former doctor @entity153 ’s boy who was fostered with his brother , @entity154 , by a @entity156 family , he is proud that the @entity8 helped people like him and hod carrier @entity1 to be successful			1
‘ @entity5 was a hard team , ’ he says			1
‘ they were hard boys			0
we had all come from broken homes , no money , we were the rags - to - riches story			0
i work on $ 20 million projects now in @entity27			1
it is because of my background at @entity5			1
i was able to come from the gutter to rise to fame and fortune , @entity1 fame and fortune , @entity120 fame and fortune			1
’ @entity4 says the worst crime at @entity5 was trying to break up a fight on the pitch rather than piling in to support your team - mate			1
‘ it was about camaraderie			0
@entity183 football is the working man ’s game , the @entity1 tackle			1
we do n’t support the @entity188 and @entity189 , ping - ping - ping			0
’ the wimbeldon team following their victory over @entity69 at @entity192 @entity4 ( centre ) and @entity1 ( right ) were central figures in @entity5 's @entity8 not surprisingly , he is in despair over what he sees as the liberalisation of football — and life , too			1
‘ on the pitch , we ’ve definitely gone soft			0
it ’s got to the extent where there is no physical play			0
football is physical , a contact sport			0
‘ everything in life has become far too liberal , my good lord			0
anything goes in @entity183 now			0
try telling your son to go to bed at 12 o’clock			0
the son will slap your face			0
you ca n’t do anything , if my son is sitting there , i ’m even scared of him			0
“ come on son , let ’s go ”			0
“ i do n’t want to go ”			0
“ ok , stay there then ”			0
i do n’t want to touch him — it ’s ridiculous , rubbish			0
i am from the old school			0
if he does something wrong , i ’ll give him a clip and off we go			0
that ’s how you become a man			0
‘ what i am saying is what i believe and what everyone else believes but dare n’t say			0
you ’re not going to have your 16 - year - old daughter coming back with her boyfriend and sleeping in the side bedroom , and allow it			2
that ’s liberalisation , i am sorry			0
