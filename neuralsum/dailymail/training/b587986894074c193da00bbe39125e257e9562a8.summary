published : 19:33 est , 30 november 2013 @entity1 : 08:22 est , 1 december 2013 the ' world 's oldest public toilet ' has been discovered in @entity4 - and scientists claim dinosaurs used enormous piles of faeces to scare away predators			1
the 240 - million - year - old ' communal latrine ' contained thousands of fossilised stools , known as coprolites , from the @entity13 , one of the largest herbivores of the @entity17 era and similar to modern rhinos			1
it was found in the @entity20 in north - west @entity4 and predates the former earliest megaherbivore communal latrine by 20 million years			1
dr @entity37 , of @entity38 , who discovered the dung heaps , told the @entity40 : ' firstly , it was important to avoid parasites - " you do n't poo where you eat " , as the saying goes			1
' but it 's also a warning to predators			2
if you leave a huge pile , you are saying : " hey ! we are a big herd			1
watch out ! " ' a selection of coprolites , demonstrating their various shapes and sizes , which shows they came from a herd of beasts the evidence also bolsters the hypothesis that @entity13 were sociable creatures			2
an estimated 30,000 coprolites are spread across the area , with a density of up to 94 coprolites per square metre			0
the largest of them weigh several kilogrammes and reach lengths of up to 35cm			0
the variation in size and shapes , ranging from tiny nuggets to long and thin , suggest they belong to several different herbivores of varying ages			0
they are a rich store of new information about the ecology of ancient ecosystems as latrines like this are extremely rare because faeces decomposes so quickly			2
dr @entity37 said a sheet of volcanic ash has preserved the ancient dung piles ' like @entity87 '			0
@entity88 , another author on the study , says they contain clues , on now - extinct plants , fungi , and parasites at a vital point in the history of evolution			2
he said : ' this was a crucial time in evolutionary history			0
the first mammals were there , living alongside the grandfather of dinosaurs			0
' maybe with these fossils we can glimpse into the lost environment which gave rise to the dinosaurs			0

the 240 - million - year - old ' communal latrine ' was discovered in @entity4
large piles of faeces warned predators a big herd was *nearby*
the stools contain *fascinating* *insights* into extinct plant life
