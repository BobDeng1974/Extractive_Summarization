by @entity0 forget how many years you ’ve clocked up — experts say what really matters when it comes to how good you look and feel is your ‘ biological age ’			1
this is the physiological age of the internal systems that keep your body functioning healthily and looking good — from your kidneys , brain and nervous tissue through to your skin			1
one of the best markers of this is the level of advanced glycation end - products ( @entity17 ) in your body			1
ages are harmful compounds that are formed by glycation : a chemical reaction that happens naturally as we age , but can be accelerated by poor lifestyle choices			1
how healthy are you ? : if you are guilty of not getting enough exercise , smoking , having high stress levels , a poor diet and not getting enough sleep , you could have a biological age that is much higher than your real one as you may have damaged your internal systems these @entity17 trigger an inflammatory response , causing tissue damage and premature ageing , as well as contributing to the development of age - related diseases such as diabetes , vision impairment , heart disease and kidney damage			1
as we revealed in our definitive sugar series with @entity43 earlier this year , your dietary intake of sugar affects the speed at which glycation happens — and therefore the rate at which @entity17 are produced			1
the more sugar you consume , the more ages are generated			1
but it ’s not only sugar that takes its toll			1
dr @entity52 , reader in clinical biochemistry at the @entity54 at @entity55 , explains : ‘ @entity56 cooked at high temperatures with direct heat , such as grilling and frying , where caramelisation occurs , increase the production of @entity17			1
’ other contributing factors include lack of exercise , smoking , high stress levels , poor diet and not getting enough sleep			1
previously , the only means of measuring your ages was through an invasive skin biopsy			1
but a new , clinically proven scanner called @entity75 can measure the levels in your skin — a good indicator of the level of @entity17 throughout the rest of your body — in 20 seconds , to give an instant picture of your inner state of health			1
the higher your level , the ‘ older ’ you are — both inside and out			1
we asked three women to discover their inner age , before @entity89 , an expert from @entity90 , the company behind the scanner , analysed their surprising results			1
@entity92 , a freelance fashion assistant , lives in @entity93 , @entity94			1
@entity97 age , 44 @entity92 : real age 19 , inner age 44			1
her love for chocolate and steak and no time to go to the gym has seen her rise from a size ten to a size 12 i left my parents ’ home in @entity110 last october and moved in with a friend in @entity94			2
most nights i ’ll have a stir - fry or make burgers or fry chicken with oven chips			2
i eat out once a week : my favourite meal is steak and chips			2
i do n’t eat breakfast , but i have a cereal bar later in the morning and a tuna sandwich with crisps for lunch			2
i love fruit and vegetables , and get my five a day			2
my big weakness is chocolate , especially @entity129 bars , and i can eat up to three a week			2
i drink quite a lot of juice , too , particularly orange juice and @entity133			2
i used to be a size ten , but now i ’m a size 12			2
a lot of this is due to stress — i ’ve just left my previous job and looking for new work is tough			2
i feel insecure and everything is up in the air			2
when i lived in @entity110 , i used to go to the gym three times a week , but i ’ve been too busy and feel very sluggish as a result			2
@entity147 ’s verdict : @entity92 ’s score is quite bad , but this is often the case with young people when they ’re living fast and not thinking much about the consequences			2
she has plenty of time to get her diet right and balance her age levels out			1
she eats a lot of fried , seared food , so even baking or steaming some of her evening meals would help			2
the higher the temperature food is cooked at , the more chemical reactions between sugar and protein will occur , forming more @entity17			1
swapping juice for water would be good , too : juice has a high sugar content , and sugar is the enemy			2
it ’s also thought high stress levels can contribute to a spike in @entity17 as when we are anxious our blood sugar levels can rise , speeding up the glycation process			1
@entity177 , an acting teacher and scriptwriter , lives in @entity179 , @entity94 , with daughter @entity180 , eight			0
@entity97 age , 57 @entity183 : real age 45 , inner age 57			1
although she is a smoker who has the odd glass of wine , @entity183 has recently started eating healthier i ’ve smoked 20 cigarettes a day for more than 20 years			0
i ’ve tried to stop several times and once managed it for nine months , but i ca n’t seem to kick the habit for good			0
i love a glass of wine with my evening meal and find it ’s a great way to relax after a hard day			0
i drink more at weekends when i ’m with friends — maybe up to half a bottle of wine in one evening			0
otherwise , i ’m quite health - conscious			0
i ’ve been trying to lose weight as i was getting heavier round the middle and had put on nearly two stone over the past year , going from a dress size 12 to 14			0
i ’ve been cutting back on carbohydrates and eating low - fat versions of everything from yogurt to soup			0
in the evenings , i ’ll try to cook a healthy meal for me and my daughter : a roast chicken with buttered cabbage , or fish with potato and green beans			0
@entity180 and i go swimming once a week and i walk my dog , @entity219 , three times a day , too			0
on the downside , i ’m a sun - worshipper , and i was a flight attendant for eight years on the @entity225 - @entity224 routes , so my skin has been damaged and i ’m more wrinkled and dry as a result , with age spots and pigmentation			1
@entity147 ’s verdict : the main contributing factors to @entity177 ’s high score are the amount she smokes and drinks			0
cigarette smoke contains a substance called nornicotine ( derived from nicotine ) , which is inhaled into the lungs and passes into the blood stream			0
@entity241 reacts with proteins in the body to produce @entity17 , and studies have found smokers have far higher levels than non-smokers			1
it would be ideal if she could stop smoking completely , but even cutting the smoking and drinking by half could improve her looks and health in weeks			0
@entity256 , a receptionist , has two daughters , @entity258 , ten , and @entity259 , eight			0
she lives with husband @entity260 in @entity262 , @entity263			0
@entity97 age , 41 @entity256 : real age 44 , inner age 41			1
after noticing how much wine her husband and her were consuming , @entity256 has cut back and started exercising several times a week towards the end of last year , my husband and i were getting through a whole bottle of wine a night			0
it was our way of winding down after a stressful day			0
i work six days a week , from 8.30am to 2pm , and during the week i ’d be rushing from one after - school club to another with the girls			0
by the time i ’d got home and prepared a quick meal , i was exhausted			0
@entity282 , i ’m a fan of anything quick — pasta with sauce or ready meals i can pop in the oven , and i ’ll steam some vegetables to go with my meal			0
i noticed i ’ve been getting fatter , so last month i gave up alcohol and started exercising			0
i go swimming once a week , and i do a legs , bums and tums class , too			0
i eat three meals a day , with cereal for breakfast , and a sandwich or cup of soup for lunch			0
i definitely feel and look better than i did four weeks ago			0
@entity147 ’s verdict : @entity256 has done really well			0
to lower her age levels further she needs to cut back on processed food and try to cook a proper meal at least a couple of nights a week			1
her new - found abstinence will have reduced her age level , as well			1
alcohol contains large amounts of sugar			0
the exercise will have helped , too , as it burns up excess sugar in the body for fuel , so lowering blood sugar and , therefore , age levels			1

experts say biological age is the best indicator of how youthful you are
biological age is the physiological age of the internal systems
one of best markers is level of @entity17 ( @entity331 )
harmful compounds ages cause tissue damage and premature ageing
