a new study has found salt consumption is not linked to higher blood pressure doctors have long warned of the dangers of a high - salt diet			1
but a new study has revealed sodium does not cause high blood pressure , and the link between the two is ' more complex than once believed '			1
hypertension is the most prevalent chronic disease across the world			1
known as a ' silent killer ' high blood pressure rarely has obvious symptoms			1
around 30 per cent of people in @entity18 have hypertension , but many are unaware			2
meanwhile in the @entity22 67 million adults ( 31 per cent ) suffer the condition			2
scientists analysed data from 8,670 @entity27 adults and concluded the assumption that salt causes higher blood pressure is ' overstated '			1
their aim was to evaluate the impact of lifestyle and nutritional factors on blood pressure levels			1
despite finding no direct link , the authors of the study did note those patients who were hypertensive ( had a high blood pressure ) consumed much higher levels of salt than those without the condition			1
their findings suggest salt affects people in different ways			0
researchers found other lifestyle factors including alcohol consumption , age , and most importantly body mass index ( @entity52 ) were all strongly linked to a rise in blood pressure			1
eating more fruit and vegetables , on the other hand , acted to reduce hypertension			0
the study authors , said : ' stopping weight increase should be the first target in the general population to counteract the hypertension epidemic , ' time reported			0
the study added : ' @entity52 was the main contributory modifiable factor of @entity68 level after multiple adjustments			0
' @entity70 ( @entity71 ) was higher in participants with elevated bmis			0
alcohol intake was positively associated with @entity71 in both sexes			0
' @entity77 intake was not associated with @entity71 in either sex after multiple adjustments			0
' however the @entity79 ( @entity79 ) in the @entity22 yesterday issued a warning that nine in 10 schoolchildren are eating more salt than is recommended			0
almost half comes from 10 processed foods - pizza , bread , savory snacks , sandwiches , cheese , processed meats , processed chicken , pasta dishes , soup and @entity94 dishes			0
the report said one in six children has raised blood pressure , which can be lowered in part by a healthy diet , including less sodium			2
@entity101 , from the @entity79 , told @entity64 : ' we consider the totality of the evidence			0
' a vast majority of scientific research confirms that as sodium is reduced , so is blood pressure			2
' the review of more than 8,000 @entity27 adults found body mass index ( @entity52 ) had the greatest affect on raised blood pressure levels			1

study of more than 8,000 @entity27 adults found no link between salt consumption and high blood pressure
30 per cent of people in @entity18 and the @entity22 suffer hypertension - high blood pressure , the most prevalent chronic disease in the world
researchers found body mass index ( @entity52 ) had the greatest impact on *systolic* blood pressure levels
