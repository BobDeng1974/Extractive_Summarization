' fortunately for me , mr @entity2 stepped in and said he would be signing me and on a permanent deal			2
it was the chance i needed			0
' @entity10 had the option of signing @entity0 but chose not to and the striker made his point by scoring against them @entity10 's scouts in @entity22 had said @entity0 was n't good enough but that only made him more determined			1

@entity3 gave me the chance and now the coach mr @entity18 believes in me too			0
i 'm enjoying it and scoring goals against @entity52 and @entity53 shows i can play at this level			0
i 'm just glad mr @entity2 put his trust in me			0
' @entity0 ( centre ) also scored against @entity53 with a close - range header at @entity58			2
