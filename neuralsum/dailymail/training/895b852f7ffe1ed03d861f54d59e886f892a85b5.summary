last week , it was easy picking for @entity2 showing @entity3 live			1
seven days ago , all they really needed was to point a camera at @entity6 and let the @entity8 manager deliver the telly gold			2
this week , however , it was more about the bigger picture			2
they had an entire city to cover			2
this they did by laying it on thick and heavy with the match they dubbed ‘ @entity18 ’			0
now there will be plenty of you thinking , well hold on , what ’s all that about with the ‘ the ’ ? a derby , yes			2
a good derby , again yes			2
so local rivalries aside , it was a big @entity45 game for the pair of them			2
nevertheless , there were plenty enough of these games in the past that did ignite and remind us what a derby match is all about			2
or as @entity55 put it when discussing the belter he was involved in 1996 , it was all about ‘ three points , and bragging rights ’			0
from here , you may have thought a few old stagers once again locking horns might have been the ideal set up for a traditional tie like this one			0
but @entity2 decided not to travel too far down memory lane			1
they could n’t have got more contemporary , for example , than they were with one of the ‘ mini derbies ’ they arranged prior to kick off			0
new @entity3 hero @entity72 was sat down alongside his fellow @entity73 and @entity31 favourite @entity74 to set the match up			1
and via subtitles , the midfielder was nicely on point when he told us ‘ all derbies are clasicos ’			0
@entity26 was happy to remind @entity27 of @entity31 's famous 6 - 1 win against @entity3 at @entity83 in 2011 @entity72 ( right ) was sat down alongside his fellow @entity73 @entity74 ( left ) to set the match up while in excellent @entity87 , the right back from the blue half was somewhat more mischievous when he said the two were ‘ not going to be friends on the pitch ’ , before nodding at his mate and adding , ‘ he ’s not understanding what i ’m saying			1
do n’t say nothing to him ’			0
but the highlight of @entity2 production for this game was the other head - to - head they had arranged			1
this one , between their pundit , and former @entity3 right back , and the man behind one of @entity38 ’s most successful exports , @entity30			1
@entity26 and @entity27 locking horns and swapping snipes was a real treat			1
sat together at a much too empty counter in a rather too fancy bar for my personal tastes , they popped away at each other like the couple of hardcore fans they clearly are			0
@entity26 was the man with the most to say			1
happy to remind @entity27 of ‘ the sheer comedy of @entity119 not knowing the score ’ when @entity31 put six past @entity3			1
that @entity122 ’s overhead was good but ‘ he did shin it ’			0
and that he hates the ‘ hypocrisy ’ of @entity3 , especially most recently after they sacked @entity125 and suddenly it ’s ‘ raining tenners ’			0
' all about one love , ' claims @entity26 as @entity27 brandishes the musician 's latest album cover but @entity2 ’s man was not to be outdone			1
turned out he was just biding his time to get his digs in			2
when @entity26 told him @entity30 had once had a meeting about the band investing in @entity137 , @entity27 chuckled ‘ that would have brought some stability to football ! ’			1
he then brandished the sleeve of a new @entity26 cd ‘ in the heat of the moment ’ - half red , half blue - and asked incredulously ‘ you signed that off ? ’			1
‘ all about one love ’ was the musician ’s awkward reply			0
but it was all in good humour , and most entertaining in the process , too			0
what ’s more , you were not left wondering if @entity26 might actually be one of those modern day ‘ prawn sandwich ’ supporters			1
‘ i learned how to sing on the @entity157 ’ he remembered fondly			0
although there may have been a whiff of the posh nosh when he also happily proclaimed ‘ i have n’t paid to get in for years ’			0
well we all would if we could , would n’t we ? so @entity2 certainly delivered their all - star moment to get their match coverage going			1
although i do wish there had perhaps been a red button alternative to it			0
i ’d love to have seen the ‘ other brothers ’ in action , too			0
@entity172 and @entity173 , down the local , with @entity174 trying to ask serious questions , while @entity172 threw cheese and onion crisps at his head			0
@entity179 saved a @entity181 penalty during a half - time shootout at the @entity183 a little idea for the return derby at @entity83 in april , perhaps ? you can have that one on me , telly people			1
but hold on , you might be saying ? what about the action on the pitch ? quite right , too			0
how could i forget that penalty save ! what a blinder that was from @entity179 at half time			1
all those years in the slips clearly paid off			0
although his opposite number from @entity197 , @entity198 , was far from impressed			0
‘ he keeps telling me he ’s a @entity200 fan ’ , said @entity198			2
‘ now he ’s kissing the @entity31 badge ’			1
very @entity26 brother , i ’m sure ! @entity198 was surprised to see alleged @entity203 grab the @entity31 badge			1

@entity2 ramp up @entity38 derby with big name interviews
@entity27 chats with @entity30 star and @entity31 fan @entity26
@entity26 reminds @entity27 about @entity31 's 6 - 1 win in 2011
@entity179 saves @entity181 penalty during half - time at the @entity183
