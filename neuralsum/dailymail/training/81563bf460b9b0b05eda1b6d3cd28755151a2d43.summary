by @entity0 published : 12:23 est , 11 march 2013 updated : 14:05 est , 11 march 2013 how often do you lie - even to yourself - on @entity3 , @entity4 or @entity5 ? perhaps online you 're in a ' complicated ' relationship , but in reality you 're all on your tod			2
maybe you 're spending saturday night at home alone with a box of @entity10 when all your @entity11 think you 're ' in the pub with the girls '			0
or are you posting photos of a beach in @entity16 , when really you 're repainting the shed in @entity17 ? a third of women admit being dishonest at least once a month on social networking sites , according to research			1
but a new ' anti-social ' networking forum , @entity24 , is hoping to bring an end to this world of made - up make - believe , enabling users to post anonymously and be as honest as they would in a personal diary			1
@entity24 allows users to post completely anonymously and without the fear of online friends judging them @entity32 - subtitled online with ' imagine if you could read other people 's thoughts ? ' - was launched to bridge the gap between what people say ( on @entity3 , @entity39 , @entity5 ) and what they really think			1
describing the site as ' as real as it gets ' , founders say the idea is that people journal ' every aspect of their lives , as it really is '			2
users predominantly take to the site to have a much - needed moan about life , relationships , work , personal struggles and financial stresses , and other writers then impart words of advice and encouragement			0
website users take to @entity32 to have a much - needed moan about work , relationships , financial woes and personal struggles , and receive words of encouragement and advice from other site members since the new online platform went live two months ago , over 3,000 people have signed up and nearly 4,000 entries have been posted			1
primarily written by women ( core demographic has been tracked as female , ages 32 - 45 ) , the site 's anonymous disclosures provide a raw , unfiltered snapshot of thoughts that would never see the light of day on personal blogs , @entity3 or even @entity39			2
this is also giving the ongoing diaries an addictive , voyeuristic quality - site viewers spend an average 12 minutes every time they visit , checking in regularly to see what 's been happening with the people they ' follow '			1
@entity88 enables people to write as if penning a personal diary , and be as miserable and honest as they like recent heartfelt posts include messages about depression , breaking up with a partner , losing jobs , bullying and guilt			1
according to one leading psychologist the pressure to stay connected on social media can paradoxically leave us more isolated			0
@entity88 enables people to be truly honest about the way they are feeling			2
dr @entity104 , @entity105 and clinical director at @entity107 said : ' the popularity of this new social media site is not surprising at all			0
we work very hard presenting ourselves to the world online , pretending and attempting to be happy all the time which is exhausting and ultimately unfulfilling			0
' omitting the less desirable imperfections of our lives from the conversations with our " friends " online leads to less opportunity to feel empathised with - resulting in a greater sense of disconnection from others			0
' @entity88 allows people to be completely honest with the world and themselves a recent survey by @entity125 into lying online revealed that 33 per cent of women are dishonest on social networking sites at least once a month			1
the most common things respondents lied or exaggerated about were what they are doing at the moment , how much they drink , where they are on holiday , how successful they are and their relationship status			0
the top reasons given for lying were worrying that others see you as boring , feeling jealous of others ' exciting posts , having nothing else to say and wanting to impress someone .			0
