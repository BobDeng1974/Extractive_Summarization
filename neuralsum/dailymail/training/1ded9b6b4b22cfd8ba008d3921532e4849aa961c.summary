by @entity0 published : 18:45 est , 16 october 2013 updated : 07:34 est , 17 october 2013 @entity1 has been forced into a bizarre apology after making a ‘ monkey ’ joke during his half - time team talk on tuesday at @entity6			1
@entity1 used the joke as he attempted to explain to right back @entity7 that he wanted to get the ball to @entity10 more often after the break during the @entity13 qualifier			1
but @entity10 tweeted on thursday morning to insist that ' no offence ' had been meant by @entity1 or taken by him			1
apology : @entity16 manager @entity1 has apologised for making a joke about a monkey during the team 's @entity13 qualifier against @entity21 on tuesday night nonplussed : @entity10 tweeted to say there was no offence meant or taken defence : @entity25 took to @entity26 to stand up for @entity1 a series of video stills which show @entity10 emerging from the tunnel for the second half good show : @entity10 put in a good performance against @entity33 before he was substituted @entity10 tweeted : ' i do n't know what all this fuss is about			1
no offence was meant and none was taken ! it 's not even news worthy ! ' @entity16 ’s head coach is believed to have upset an unnamed player in the dressing room during the 2 - 0 win over @entity21 that secured @entity16 ’s @entity13 place			1
the @entity46 have confirmed that @entity1 did make the remarks , but are disappointed that it has been interpreted by some as a racial slur or innuendo			1
@entity1 said on wednesday night : ‘ i would like to apologise if any offence has been caused by what i said at half - time			1
‘ there was absolutely no intention on my part to say anything inappropriate			2
‘ i made this clear straight away to @entity10 in the dressing room			1
i also spoke to @entity10 again on wednesday			1
‘ he has assured me and the @entity46 he did not take any offence and understood the point i was making in the manner i intended			2
’ video : watch the players emerge from the tunnel at half - time clash : the joke came in a half - time team - talk during the crunch game at @entity72 the joke , which is believed to have been told in full at half - time , is as follows			1
‘ @entity74 decided they would finally send a man up in an capsule after sending only monkeys in the earlier missions			2
‘ they fire the man and the monkey into space			0
’ ‘ the intercom crackles “ fire the retros ”			0
‘ a little later , “ monkey , check the solid fuel supply ’ ‘ later still “ monkey , check the life support systems for the man ”			0
‘ the astronaut takes umbrage and radios @entity74			0
“ when do i get something ”			0
’ ‘ @entity74 replied – in 15 minutes , feed the monkey			0
’ @entity16 ’s head coach is furious and insists it was an analogy about @entity74 sending a monkey into space and can not be interpreted in any other way			0
@entity10 has been spoken to by the @entity46 and insists he has no issue with the joke			1
his father @entity100 works for the kick it out campaign and is believed to have discussed the issue with his son			2
@entity1 is understood to be distraught by any attempt to smear his name after successfully leading @entity16 to the @entity13 finals on tuesday			1
although he is known for lengthy team talks to his players at times , @entity1 ’s decision to make an attempt to tell a joke at the break does seem unusual			1
the 66 - year - old is a man of vast experience but is dealing with a much younger dressing - room in a modern climate			0
success : the @entity16 team secured their passage to next year 's @entity13 in @entity122 by the 2 - 0 victory goalscorer @entity25 jumped to @entity1 's defence on thursday morning , he tweeted : ' seen the story on roy this morning			1
' @entity131 boss @entity130 did not think that it was an issue			0
he said : we are a politically correct country and we have to be careful about what we say today			0
but if we continue to wipe it up and promote everything in the press , nobody will be able to say a word shortly			0
' we 'll have to keep ourselves quiet and not express opinions			0
we should n't be saying anything wrong but you have to be very careful today			0
i 'm sure with what @entity1 said he did n't mean any offence or any harm			1
' former @entity16 international @entity148 , meanwhile , insisted the joke makes no reference to race			2
' if @entity1 has said that phrase in the dressing room then it is in the context of the story , ' he told @entity156			1
' people are walking on egg shells , worried about everything they say			0
why would the word " monkey " have a racist feel for someone in the dressing room , or any player ? i ca n’t see the link , can you ? ' we ’ve all got the right to feel offence , but this is really spurious			1
what are you actually offended by ? the word " monkey " ? i do n’t see any reference to race			2
you have to look at the big picture			0
' is @entity1 , from what we know of him over the last 30 - 40 years , the sort of man to go out of his way to be stupid enough to cause offence ? i would say no. ' star : the remark came as @entity1 urged players to pass to up - and - coming @entity187 the row has taken the gloss off @entity16 ’s qualification and came as it was revealed that @entity1 is in line for a huge bonus after leading @entity16 to @entity122			1
if he is successful next summer , the cash reward he will receive could touch the £ 1million mark			0
@entity1 accepted a basic package worth £ 3m a year when he was released by @entity196 to take the team to @entity198 following @entity200 ’s exit			2
his salary is less than half the @entity203 ’s £ 6.5m wage during his five - year spell as @entity16 manager , but there are huge bonuses in the deal			0
@entity1 has a number of targets , including further incentives for progressing beyond the group stage in @entity122			2
the bonuses for qualifying were put in place before the first group game against @entity217 last september but the incentives for progress next summer will be decided in the new year			0
relief : @entity1 celebrates at @entity6 , and is now in line for a big bonus if @entity16 do well next summer			2
