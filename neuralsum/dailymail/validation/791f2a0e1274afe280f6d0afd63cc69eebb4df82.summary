retired @entity1 politician @entity0 says he passed on a third presidential campaign because ' it just did n't feel right ' and will instead allocate his time to business and philanthropic causes , as well as his wife @entity6 and their 23 grandchildren			1
' somehow , it just did n’t feel like this was the right time for us to step forward , ' @entity0 told @entity13 news anchor @entity12 during an interview that was released on thursday			1
' i would love to be president			2
i just concluded i was not the best person to carry forward the @entity1 torch			1
' @entity0 would n't endorse one of the many possible @entity1 presidential candidates in his first interview since he took his name off the 2016 roster but spoke sharply of @entity25 front - runner @entity24			1
@entity12 interviews @entity0 in @entity26 , @entity27 , at his son 's home			2
' i would love to be president			2
i just concluded i was not the best person to carry forward the @entity1 torch , ' @entity0 told her @entity0 would n't endorse one of the many possible @entity1 presidential candidates in his first interview since he took his name off the 2016 roster but spoke sharply of @entity25 front - runner @entity24 former @entity33 gov. @entity32 , @entity35 gov. @entity34 , @entity33 sen. @entity36 and @entity38 sen. @entity37 would all make tremendous presidents , he indicated			1
@entity32 , who was widely considered @entity0 's biggest hurdle toward securing the @entity1 presidential nomination for a second consecutive time due to their similarity in background and policy positions , @entity0 described as a ' sound , effective governor			1
' he will make for ' a very formidable and capable candidate , ' said @entity0 , who met privately with the fellow former governor just before he definitively ended rumors that he was contemplating a 2016 bid			2
@entity34 he characterized as ' a man of integrity and character ' and said ' he makes a very compelling case to become a nominee			2
' ' he was one that faced a recall , fought for his agenda ; it was supported by the people of @entity35 , ' @entity0 told @entity12			2
' i think a guy like that really has stood the test of a very close inspection			0
' @entity0 also voiced approval of a possible @entity36 candidacy , saying the freshman senator ' has really distinguished himself ' on foreign policy			1
and while he and @entity37 , whose father @entity71 competed against the @entity73 governor for the party 's blessing in both 2008 and 2012 , do n't often see eye to eye , particularly on foreign policy issues , @entity0 said he understands the draw to the non-traditional @entity1 lawmaker			1
' a lotta young people are very excited about @entity37			0
and of course , there ’s a libertarian strain in my party , and he ’s connected with a lotta folks who wan na see us take a different course as a party , ' @entity0 said			2
' i mean , more power to him as he expresses his views			0
' @entity92 , on the other hand , is in quite ' a mess ' over her secret server and will have to defend what he called ' the @entity24 / @entity98 foreign policy			1
' ' i mean , it ’s always something with the @entity101 , ' he said , responding to a question about the former secretary of state 's email debacle			1
' they have rules which they describe before they get into something , and then they decide they do n’t have to follow their own rules			1
and that , i think , is gon na be a real problem for her , ' he said			0
he added , ' she did n’t follow the rules and regulations of the federal government			1
' the former @entity73 governor said he passed on a third presidential campaign because ' it just did n't feel right ' and would instead allocate his time to business and philanthropic causes , as well as his wife @entity6 , pictured here during the interview , and their 23 grandchildren ' somehow , it just did n’t feel like this was the right time for us to step forward , ' @entity0 told @entity13 news anchor @entity12 during their interview on wednesday , which was released thursday @entity0 became the laughing stock of much of the political class in the lead up to the 2012 election when he named @entity136 as the @entity138 ' greatest geopolitical foe but has since been heralded by @entity1 as as visionary			1
in the interview he again scrutinized @entity92 for her infamous ' reset ' with @entity136 and the mock button she gave the country 's top diplomat @entity144 in 2009			0
he also warned that @entity147 extremists abroad are unlikely to suffer defeat if the @entity98 administration continues to refuse to put @entity138 troops on the ground			0
' i ’m afraid you ’re gon na have to see more @entity138 military involvement in order to keep @entity156 from spreading even further , ' he said			0
it would be ideal for most of the ground troops to be provided by regional partners such as ' @entity160 or @entity161 or others , ' @entity0 said			0
' but i think , as the @entity163 , you have to say that we will defeat @entity156 , period			0
and we will do what ’s necessary for that to happen			0
' reacting to former @entity98 senior adviser @entity174 's claims in his memoir that @entity0 suggested in his election night , congratulatory call to the president that he won reelection because blacks in urban cities voted for him , @entity0 said a ' misunderstanding ' must have occurred			1
@entity174 claims that @entity0 told @entity98 , ' you really did a great job of getting the vote out in places like @entity182 and @entity183			2
' ' i certainly did not , ' @entity0 told @entity12			0
' i remember going into the room with a few of my staff people , picking up the phone and being as gracious as i could possibly be at a very difficult time , and congratulating the president on winning and congratulating him on having a good campaign and running a good campaign			0
the former @entity1 politician acknowledged that he ' may well have said what a good job they did turning people out , because they did			0
' but ' i do n’t even know what happened in @entity183 , so some of those quotes are obviously a misunderstanding			0
' ' i had nothing but congratulations for the president and positive feelings that i expressed to him , ' he posited .			0

' i would love to be president . i just concluded i was not the best person to carry forward the @entity1 torch , ' @entity0 said
it was his first interview since he took his name off the 2016 roster
@entity0 would n't endorse one of the many possible @entity1 presidential candidates but spoke *highly* of @entity34 , @entity32 and @entity36
@entity24 , on the other hand , is in ' a mess ' over her secret server and will have to defend ' the @entity24 / @entity98 foreign policy '
' i mean , it ’s always something with the @entity101 . they have rules which they describe *...* then they decide they do n’t have to follow their own rules '
@entity0 said it 's ' certainly ' not true that in his election night , congratulatory call to @entity163 he suggested he won because of blacks
