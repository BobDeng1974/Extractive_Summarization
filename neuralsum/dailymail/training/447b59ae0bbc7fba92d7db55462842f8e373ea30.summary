by @entity0 published : 05:15 est , 22 november 2012 updated : 11:41 est , 22 november 2012 an @entity2 elephant keeper , who was almost crushed to death by the animal she had cared for from its birth , told for the first time today how she felt ‘ challenged ’ before the beast attacked her			1
@entity8 , 40 , who spent 12 days in hospital after suffering a heart attack and severe injuries when the elephant pinned her to a metal bollard at @entity15 ’s @entity14 , said she noticed a change in the usually timid @entity17 moments before the attack			1
miss @entity8 gave a dramatic insight into the incident in a letter posted on the @entity14 website today			2
although conscious when paramedics arrived at the zoo , she then lapsed into a coma and had a cardiac arrest for about five minutes			0
the medics managed to save her life but she remained critical in hospital for several days afterwards			2
miss @entity8 said she noticed a change in the two - year - old elephant – formerly known as mr @entity45 – when he failed to respond to one of her orders during a routine training session			1
‘ when he did not respond , i sensed a behavioural change in him and realised he was thinking of challenging me , ’ she wrote of the elephant she and other keepers had hand - reared followed his traumatic birth			0
close call : miss @entity8 told how the elephant put his trunk against her chest , took her breath away and prevented her from ordering him to move away at @entity14 ( pictured ) ‘ i immediately tried to redirect his thoughts by asking him for a different behaviour and at the same time i was making my way out of the stall			1
‘ unfortunately , just as i was almost out , he raised his trunk and pinned me against one of the metal bollards			0
‘ his trunk on my chest took my breath away , which made it impossible for me to talk and tell him to stop			0
’ miss @entity8 said it was fortunate that her co-workers were on hand to immediately move the elephant away			2
cared since birth : the elephant , who lived in this enclosure at the zoo , caused miss @entity8 to suffer a heart attack , severe injuries , and lapse into a coma she suggested that @entity17 might have challenged her because of his low confidence levels following his traumatic birth , which had resulted in him being hand reared by @entity91 and other keepers			1
despite her injuries , which included broken ribs , miss @entity8 has decided to courageously continue raising @entity17			1
she said that being a part of raising the elephant after such a traumatic start to his life remained one of the biggest highlights of her career			0
she was looking forward , she said , to being reunited with @entity17 once her fractured ribs had healed .			0
