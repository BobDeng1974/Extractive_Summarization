@entity0 must learn to choose his tennis commitments wisely to avoid a repeat of his @entity4 exit , former mentor @entity5 has warned			1
@entity0 was beaten 6 - 0 6 - 1 by @entity6 in his group b match at the @entity8 last month , which was the @entity10 's worst result in seven years			1
his seventh successive qualification for the @entity4 needed a mammoth run of tournaments in @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 - the eventual strain meant @entity6 needed all of 56 minutes to dispense of @entity0			1
@entity22 and @entity0 share a joke while participating in the inaugural @entity24 last weekend the @entity10 apologies to the crowd after being thrashed 6 - 0 , 6 - 1 by @entity6 last month in @entity27 and @entity5 , who mentored and coached a teenage @entity0 during his years at the @entity29 - @entity5 academy in @entity30 , feels the @entity10 has to start working smarter in 2015			1
speaking at the academy 's visit to @entity33 , where it delivered a series of performance player , coach , and adult workshops , @entity5 told @entity39 : ' he needs to choose well			1
' i think he did about five ( tournaments ) in a row before the @entity4			0
' it 's difficult to play more than three for these guys			2
more than three , it depends on the player			0
@entity0 's , in action in @entity48 , played six straight tournaments to qualify for the @entity50 @entity0 linked up with @entity51 just before @entity52 , where the two are pictured back in july ' at the beginning , when you are young , it 's good that you play everything - it is the best way to learn			1
' at 18 , 19 , 20 we used to play 36 , 37 tournaments			0
the more you get a better ranking you have to choose little bit			0
he has to do that			0
' he took the risk maybe with that match ( against @entity6 ) , i do n't know what happened			2
' it has been a transitional year of sorts for @entity0 , not least with @entity51 joining him as coach in june , following @entity72 's exit			1
in late november , @entity0 parted ways with long - term coaches @entity74 and @entity76 , the latter having befriended him as a teenager in @entity30			1
@entity5 mentored @entity0 for 15 years at the @entity29 - @entity5 academy in @entity30 nevertheless , @entity5 is confident @entity0 remains in prime condition to challenge for more @entity82 titles , despite the pressure that comes from being @entity85 's most successful tennis player of the open era			1
' these guys play a lot , they play a lot of years at high level with pressure from sponsors , press , the country , and they get tired , ' @entity5 added			2
' as far as you are getting older , you are fit , but it 's tough to recover			2
from one day to the other one , when you wake up it 's different to when you were in your twenties			0
' @entity0 is still very young - 27 is good			1
he 's at his peak			0
' you mature well , you do n't do mistakes as when you were a junior			0
