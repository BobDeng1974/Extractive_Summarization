@entity0 announced scrapping income tax paid on interest from regular high street accounts the chancellor heralded a savings revolution yesterday by scrapping income tax paid on interest from regular high street accounts			1
in a major move to counter the effects of years of historically low interest rates , he announced a new personal savings allowance that will make ordinary accounts tax - free for 95 per cent of the population			1
it means a basic rate taxpayer can earn £ 1,000 in savings interest without paying tax			1
a higher rate taxpayer will be able to earn £ 500			1
at current rates , a basic rate taxpayer would need to have more than £ 70,000 in an average account to go over the new £ 1,000 allowance			1
by stopping tax on savings the chancellor has effectively handed a 20 per cent boost to the rates earned by most savers in the @entity29			1
the revenue estimates that the allowance will benefit some 28 million savers			2
the way savings are taxed is currently riddled with complications			0
every year someone can pay in £ 15,000 to a cash @entity38 where interest is paid tax - free			1
but on a standard high street savings account , interest is taxed at the saver ’s normal rate of income tax			1
this tax is automatically deducted by a bank and building society before the interest is paid , and passed directly to @entity49			2
higher earners paying 40 per cent or 45 per cent income tax are supposed to declare the interest they receive on a self - assessment form			1
lower earners who do not pay income tax can fill in a form to stop the tax being deducted			0
these deductions mean that someone with £ 20,000 in a high street savings account paying 2 per cent would earn only £ 320 a year interest if they were a basic rate taxpayer			1
a higher rate tax payer would earn £ 240 and a top rate taxpayer £ 220			1
if the interest was untaxed the saver would earn £ 400			1
in addition to this , those with total income below £ 15,600 a year can apply to have their savings interest paid tax - free			1
every year thousands of pensioners who can claim tax - free interest on their savings miss out on this perk because they do not realise they qualify			1
it means a basic rate taxpayer can earn £ 1,000 in savings interest without paying tax , while a higher rate taxpayer will be able to earn £ 500 figures from @entity49 suggest around £ 1.8billion a year is received a year in savings interest tax			1
@entity0 said @entity29 will be back in the black before the end of the decade – as he shot down @entity91 ’s claims that he is taking the country back to the 1930s			2
the chancellor outlined plans to bank a surplus of £ 5.2billion in 2018 - 19 – the first since 2001 – as he hailed a @entity29 ‘ that is growing , creating jobs and paying its way ’			1
he said the national debt will start to fall as a percentage of national income next year , having risen consistently since 2001			0
‘ those 13 years amount to the longest year - on - year rise in our national debt since the end of the 17th century , ’ he said			0
‘ today we bring that record to an end			0
’ the chancellor announced that state spending will fall to 36 per cent of national income in 2019 - 20 – marginally above the 35.9 per cent it reached in 1999 - 2000			2
he had previously planned to slash spending to 35.2 per cent of national income – the lowest level since the 1930s			0
but mr @entity0 said the reality was that the state will now return to a size last seen under the previous @entity91 government ‘ before spending got out of control ’			0
two years ago , @entity29 ’s building societies called for the government to scrap all tax on savings to remove this complexity			1
yesterday the chancellor revealed his major overhaul			0
his introduction of a personal savings allowance means that from april 2016 those who earn below £ 16,800 a year wo n’t have to pay any tax on savings interest			1
meanwhile , anyone earning below £ 42,700 – the point at which higher rate tax starts – will be allowed to have £ 1,000 in savings interest tax free			1
those with earnings from £ 42,701 to £ 150,000 will have a £ 500 allowance			2
anyone earning more than this , and paying the 45 per cent tax band , has to pay tax on their savings interest			1
the @entity149 has welcomed the move			0
a spokesman said : ‘ this is great news for savers			0
we are delighted to get rid of the complicated tax system on savings			2
’ @entity157 , director of analysts @entity158 , said : ‘ it feels like interest rates on savings accounts have been falling for ever , and so this effectively gives them a 20 per cent boost to a basic rate taxpayer			1
‘ it makes regular savings accounts as competitive as tax - free cash isas , and the change is likely to force a serious change in the way people save			2
’ @entity173 , director at investment firm @entity174 , said : ‘ this allowance will eradicate the double taxation most people currently experience , where they pay tax on their wages and tax again on the interest from their savings			1
however , it does little to deal with the paltry interest rates currently on offer to savers			1
’ thumbs up : @entity186 - with @entity187 , four , and @entity188 , two - welcomed the tax - free boost @entity190 , 36 , and his wife , @entity191 , 41 , have more than £ 45,000 in savings			1
they described yesterday ’s announcement that the first £ 1,000 in interest on savings will be tax - free from april 2016 as ‘ fantastic news ’			1
it means they will keep all of the interest they earn on their savings			1
mr @entity186 earns £ 42,000 as a @entity204 teacher , while his wife is a stay - at - home mother			2
they are keen savers and put a lot of money aside after mrs @entity209 was made redundant from her job , where she earned £ 75,000			2
they have £ 10,000 in a high - rate savings account , £ 20,000 in a current account and £ 15,000 in an @entity38 they also put £ 200 per month in a regular saver for their children , four - year - old @entity187 and two - year - old @entity188			1
mr @entity186 said : ‘ this is fantastic news for us			0
interest rates are so low that it ’s really hard to save money , so any helping hand to make saving more worthwhile is going to be beneficial			2
‘ we earned £ 150 on our @entity38 last year , so for us to see our savings income be protected from tax really gets the thumbs up			1
’ flexibility to dip in and out of your @entity228 by @entity230 , @entity231 plans to introduce smart cash machines which allow customers to pay in as well as withdraw cash could lead to bank branch closures , experts warned last night			0
budget documents yesterday revealed plans to develop new atms that will offer a range of services currently only available inside branches			0
as well as taking out money and getting balance statements , people will be able to deposit cash and cheques			0
these machines already exist in many branches to cut down queues , but are only available to customers of that bank			0
it is thought the new machines could allow customers of any bank to use them			0
however @entity257 , director of the @entity258 , said : ‘ these will lead to the closure of more branches			0
’ last year 479 bank branches shut – more than double the number that closed the year before			0
savers will able to dip in and out of their @entity38 without using up their vital annual allowance , the chancellor has announced			2
currently , everyone can pay £ 15,000 a year in to an @entity38 – which is rising to £ 15,240 from april 6			0
isas are hugely popular with savers as they allow them to earn interest without paying tax			1
around 10.5 million were opened last year			0
but at present , once savers have invested their full allowance , that ’s it			2
should they need to make any emergency withdrawals during the year they are not then allowed to later put any extra cash back in to replenish their account			0
many savers find this a huge inconvenience as it means their one - off allowance disappears if they suddenly need to get money out in arush			2
so the @entity289 plans to overhaul the rules in the autumn			0
from then , savers will be able to pay £ 15,240 in to an @entity38 and then , for example , withdraw £ 2,000			2
should they get another £ 2,000 later in the year they will then be able to put this back in to their account to top up back up to the maximum allowance			2
it is the latest change to @entity228 which were given an overhaul at the last budget			0
then the chancellor increased the annual allowance to £ 15,000 , and said savers would be allowed to move between cash and shares			1
investors in stocks and shares @entity228 will not benefit from the new rule			0
@entity0 said the government would offload £ 11billion of mortgages the state was left holding the sale of bank assets taken on by the government during the financial crisis will raise £ 20billion to pay down the national debt , the chancellor said			2
the @entity289 plans to sell at least £ 9billion worth of shares in @entity318 in the coming year as it reduces its stake in the bailed - out lender			0
mr @entity0 said the government would also offload £ 11billion of mortgages the state was left holding following the rescue of @entity325 and @entity326 and @entity327			0
‘ the last government put taxpayers ’ money into the banks – this government is getting it back , ’ he said			0
mr @entity0 said it would be ‘ deeply irresponsible ’ to treat the cash as a ‘ windfall ’ that could be spent ahead of may ’s election			0
he added that it would involve ‘ spending money we did n’t really have ’ and ‘ racking up borrowing our country could n’t afford ’			0
‘ we ’d be repeating all the mistakes the last government made instead of fixing those mistakes , ’ he said			0
instead the money raised from the sales – as well as savings from lower welfare bills and debt interest payments – will be used to pay down the national debt .			0
