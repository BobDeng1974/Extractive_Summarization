by @entity0 @entity1 : multi-millionaire @entity2 is the man behind the company that supplied @entity5 supermarkets with horsemeat contaminated burgers many of @entity5 's biggest retailers were forced to pull products from their shelves yesterday as their suppliers were found to be selling beefburgers laced with horse meat			1
@entity15 's were found to contain up to 29 per cent equine dna , while @entity17 , @entity18 's and the co-op all withdrew frozen burgers as a ' precautionary measure '			1
today the @entity21 reveals that a multi-millionaire beef supplier dubbed ‘ @entity1 ’ is behind the company that supplied @entity5 supermarkets with contaminated food			2
@entity2 , 76 , is a director of the @entity25 which owns the meat processors @entity27 in @entity28 and @entity29 in @entity30 , @entity31			1
his family owns a sprawling country home on a 700 - acre estate in @entity36 , @entity37 and property around @entity39 including a share in the @entity42 headquarters of @entity43			2
but in @entity37 , the @entity2 name is synonymous with financial malpractice after he dragged the country ’s beef industry through the dirt in the 1990s after details of his business links with @entity52 ’s @entity51 were exposed			1
@entity53 - driving mr @entity2 , an intensely private man , started out as a 15 - year - old school drop - out selling sheep guts to butchers in @entity57 , @entity37 for use as sausage skin			1
he made his first fortune after he founded @entity61 in 1962 and started selling beef to @entity64 countries including @entity52 ’s @entity51			1
but @entity66 sanctions imposed on @entity51 after @entity52 invaded @entity67 in 1990 led @entity51 to default on millions of pounds of payments to @entity2 ’s company			1
eventually the banks took a 60 per cent stake in the business and @entity2 – a lifetime teetotaller – was allowed to cling on to the rest			1
but an investigation by @entity91 journalist @entity90 , now an @entity37 @entity93 senator , subsequently revealed serious financial malpractice involving the @entity95			1
that then led to a judicial tribunal in @entity37 , known as the @entity98 , which shone a light on the relationship between @entity2 and @entity37 ’s then @entity102 @entity101			1
boss : @entity2 is a director of the @entity104			1
pictured is the @entity25 foods factory in @entity107 , @entity31 which is one of the frozen food suppliers identified as using horse meat in burgers it was during this hearing that @entity2 – one of @entity37 ’s richest men with a fortune believed to be worth around £ 600million – became dubbed ‘ @entity1 ’ by the @entity37 media			1
for many , it is simply a matter of economics			2
while calling the vet to put down a lame or surplus horse can cost in excess of £ 200 , abattoirs will gladly pay £ 300 for an unwanted animal			2
as a result , 8,118 horses and ponies were slaughtered in @entity5 in 2011 , to be sent to the continent to be sold as gourmet meat			2
nothing is wasted , with their skins going into the leather trade , while any off - cuts will be used as dog food			2
most will be former pets their owners can not care for or riding school mounts that can no longer pay their way because they are too old to work			2
but according to @entity143 , a campaigner for charity @entity144 , in 2011 ‘ 1,127 were thoroughbreds discarded by the racing industry ’ , which ‘ overproduces horses each year ’			2
the number of @entity5 horses ending their days in the slaughterhouse has doubled since 2008 , a little - known consequence of the recession			2
mr @entity143 said around 10,000 horses and ponies are now believed to be slaughtered in @entity5 each year			0
‘ with belt - tightening following the recession , it is often luxuries such as horses that face the chop , ’ he said			0
‘ it makes sense they would end up in slaughterhouses rather than paying a vet a fee or trying to sell them on			0
‘ the real scandal behind the horse slaughter figures is that the volume of horses being produced for the pet and horse racing industries is unregulated and out of control			0
’ permitted methods of slaughter include shooting with a bullet , or stunning with a penetrative bolt followed by immediate bleeding			0
there are two major abattoirs that take horses in @entity5 , but they are not keen on publicising it			0
several thousand live horses are believed to be sent to the continent for slaughter			0
customers in @entity184 , @entity185 and @entity186 like horse meat			0
small amounts are also eaten in @entity189 , @entity190 , @entity191 and @entity192			0
a spokesman for the @entity194 said almost all @entity5 horse meat is exported			0
‘ it is legal to slaughter and sell horse meat in the @entity5 , provided it is from an approved abattoir and the meat must carry the stamp declaring it is fit for human consumption , ’ he added			0
it emerged that after winning an election in 1987 @entity101 had agreed to underwrite a multi-million pound beef contract @entity2 had secured with @entity51			1
the agreement meant the @entity37 government had effectively provided @entity2 with an insurance that meant the taxpayer would foot the bill if @entity51 reneged on its payments			1
at the time @entity51 was embroiled in a bitter war with its neighbour @entity214			0
the policy was later cancelled			0
despite the findings of the @entity217 was never charged with any wrongdoing			0
less than five years after he was bailed out @entity2 was able to buy his business back from the banks for £ 30million			1
the beef baron ’s processing company , @entity222 , has not published accounts since 2001 when it recorded a turnover of £ 720million			0
his companies now have contracts with fast food chains and supermarkets including @entity15 , @entity230 , @entity17 and @entity18 ’s			1
now the company is under investigation again by the @entity233 amid suspicions that it may have received contaminated meat from unchecked sources			0
@entity27 yesterday said it was withdrawing 10million beef patties from stores across @entity37 and the @entity5			0
the @entity25 yesterday said it had despatched its own auditors to two of its suppliers to conduct spot checks on their products			1
in a statement it said : ‘ we take this matter extremely seriously and apologise for the understandable concern this issue has caused			0
‘ @entity25 companies have never knowingly bought , handled or supplied equine meat products and we acknowledge the understandable concern created as a result of the @entity233 of @entity37 ’s @entity254 frozen beef burger test results			1
’ it also said it was introducing a new testing regime for its meat products which will include dna analysis			0
in the @entity37 parliament yesterday @entity259 agriculture spokesman @entity258 demanded to know the names of the companies in @entity189 and the @entity263 which are believed to have supplied contaminated products			1
the @entity37 minister for agriculture @entity265 said any companies involved in the production of beef burgers containing horse meat would be named			2
he said : ‘ if there are inappropriate linkages here , we will highlight those			0
’ a spokesman for mr @entity2 said he would not be making a personal statement on the horse meat issue .			1

@entity2 , 76 , is a director of the @entity25
he was revealed to have had business links with @entity52
his companies have deals with @entity15 , @entity18 , @entity17 and @entity230
