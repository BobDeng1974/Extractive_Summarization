@entity1 manager @entity0 has given up on signing @entity2 forward @entity3 this month			1
the former @entity5 boss had hoped to use the uncertainty over the former @entity9 international 's future to his gain and lure commons south			0
but he has now ruled out a late january move after @entity2 made it clear the out - of - contract attacker will not be sold in this transfer window			2
@entity1 boss @entity0 used to be manager of @entity2 before taking over the @entity16 club @entity0 wanted @entity3 ( right ) to join him at @entity1 but accepts it will not happen in january @entity0 told @entity18 : ' @entity2 have come out publicly and said he 's not for sale , he wo n't be leaving and we have n't pursued that any further			1
' i 've got a great relationship with @entity2 , a great relationship with @entity24 [ @entity25 ] and i do n't want to damage that			0
' people keep asking me about @entity3 and i feel uncomfortable talking about him because he is @entity2 's player at the end of the day			1
' @entity3 , was a central figure under @entity0 , netting 31 goals in the @entity32 's final season in charge			1
but under @entity34 , he has been in and out of the side as he was forced to accept his position was not guaranteed			0
however , @entity0 believes @entity2 should look to tap into more than just his playing abilities as he recommended the 31 - year - old for a future coaching role with the @entity40			2
commons has not been a regular in the @entity2 team under manager @entity44 @entity0 said : ' it was something that myself and @entity24 talked about			1
@entity3 gets the club , he gets @entity2			2
' he was having a great season last year and we talked about it in terms of working again together when his career finished			0
he 's an intelligent boy , i think he 'd have plenty to offer on the coaching side of things			0
' i think he would be an asset for @entity2 in a coaching capacity			0

@entity0 wanted to sign @entity2 *midfielder* @entity3 in january
commons ' contract expires at @entity63 *champions* at the end of the season
but @entity2 have *refused* to allow @entity3 to leave the club
