@entity13 is an attractive , intelligent women with a tattoo on her left upper thigh ( file photo ) author @entity18 has two tattoos on her right foot ( and one on her bikini line ) - the feet and ankles tend to be the favoured place for women to have tattoos although @entity29 bitterly regrets having hers the study showed professionals are now marginally more likely to be tattooed than their working class counter parts – of which only 27 per cent have undergone the needle			1
it is a trend that has even become well established in the ‘ @entity38 ’ upper class , with 19 per cent adorned with body art. @entity40 , research assistant at @entity41 , which conducted the study , said that the tattoo was no longer the preserve of the working classes			1
@entity46 @entity45 is a typical middle - class woman - she works in finance in the @entity49 and has a small tattoo above her ankle ( file photo ) many women plump for a discreet tattoo that can not be seen when they are dressed ( file photos ) he said : ‘ the tattoo appears to have transcended traditional class boundaries			1
’ the study , which looked at more than 2,000 people across the country and from different demographics , found that 6 per cent of the middle classes had between three and five pieces of body art and 17 per cent had between six and ten			1
only 1 per cent had more than ten			0
but according to tattoo parlours , these new customers are adopting a wholly more conservative slant on the ancient craft			2

‘ they tend to be on the ankle , the foot , the lower back or the shoulder blade			0
celebrities : @entity108 , once of the @entity109 ( left ) has several tattoos but not as many as @entity111 ( right , before she was almost totally adorned in them ) who has many all over her body ‘ middle - class men tend to go for letters and scripts			1
koi fish tattoos are popular			0
men tend to get tattoos on their backs , legs and under - arms			0
they do n't tend to go really big			0
’ he said that after working in the tattoo industry for 18 years , he has seen a marked change in his customers in the last decade			1
‘ tattoos are more accepted and more of a fashion accessory these days , so it has become more normal and therefore more attractive to all sorts of classes , ’ he said			2
‘ coming through the door now is mainly professionals , aged between late 20s and 40s			0
they are the main core of our establishment			0
’ the transition among the classes has been felt throughout the industry , with many parlours adopting classier looking décor to attract moneyed customers			0
fortunately most women do n't go as far as having a tattoo ' sleeve ' covering their whole arm @entity146 , publicist for the international @entity148 , has seen a dramatic growth in popularity since the event began in 2005			2
