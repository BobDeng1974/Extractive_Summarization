by @entity1 reporter published : 15:35 est , 19 september 2013 updated : 17:01 est , 19 september 2013 for more than 60 years , historians and literary researchers have wondered about the identity of @entity5 , the mysterious author of ' @entity6 '			1
the ' @entity7 ' is an account of life as a house slave written in the 1850s , but was only discovered in 1948			1
while the account has been verified , until recently the author 's identity has alluded experts			1
case solved : a professor in @entity18 claims to have ended the 60 - year mystery surrounding the life of ' the @entity21 's narrative ' author @entity5 , who wrote about life as a slave after escaping the south yesterday , in the @entity25 , a professor in @entity18 stepped forward saying he finally traced crafts ' roots back to a woman named @entity5 , who lived a very similar life as the novel 's protagonist			1
end of story : @entity35 professor @entity34 traced @entity5 origins to a slave born in @entity38 named @entity5 @entity39 , a @entity41 black history archivist , discovered the manuscript in 1948 at a @entity44 bookseller and bought the book for $ 85			1
more than 50 years later in 2001 , the manuscript went up for auction and was won for $ 8,500 by @entity48 historian @entity47			1
within a year , mr @entity47 verified the manuscript and said it was written before 1861 since there was no mention of the war or secession			2
other experts agreed after analyzing the ink and paper			2
publishers were quick to snap up the rights to the narrative with a female perspective of life as a slave and in 2002 it was published by @entity62			1
but without a confirmed identity for the author , literary researchers found it hard to make any sort of statement on the account			1
' i think there was some suspended judgement because we did n't have a traceable historical person , ' @entity71 , an @entity72 professor at the @entity73 , @entity70 told the @entity25			2
we had all sorts of interesting inferences			0
but we could n't talk about the book without any confidence of authorial intention if we did n't know who the author was			2
' professor @entity34 , a @entity88 literature expert at @entity89 , seems to have made the most convincing pitch so far : @entity5 was really @entity5			1
he came to this conclusion after conducting interviews and studying wills , diaries , handwritten almanacs and public records which led him to the slave who worked at the plantation owned by @entity100 in @entity101 , @entity38			1
@entity100 was a prominent @entity38 who would go on to serve as @entity103 and the @entity104 to @entity105			1
@entity5 was a self - educated woman who waited on the lady of the house , @entity106			1
but in 1867 she escaped , dressed as a man in a suit , possibly given to her by a @entity100 family member			1
clues : left , a picture of @entity114 owner @entity100			1
the plantation often took boarders from a local school where they had to memorize excerpts of @entity121 ' @entity120 , which is referenced in @entity123 ' book she escaped first to @entity125 before eventually settling in @entity126 , marrying , and becoming a school teacher			1
in @entity125 she was sheltered by a family by the last name of crafts , hence the author 's pseudonym			1
mr @entity47 , the manuscript 's owner , believes the conclusion and so do other respected @entity48 historians			1
@entity136 of @entity137 called it a ' tremendous finding '			0
@entity136 said she was ' totally convinced ' @entity141 is crafts ' to the extent that anything historical can be documented without an @entity146 picture of her writing the novel			2
' mr @entity34 plans to publish his case in a book tentatively titled ' @entity151 of @entity5 '			1
it may be that i assume to [ o ] much responsibility in attempting to write these pages			0
the world will probably say so , and i am aware of my deficiencies			0
i am neither clever , nor learned , nor talented			0
when a child they used to scold and find fault with me because they said i was dull and stupid			0
perhaps under other circumstances and with more encouragement i might have appeared better ; for i was shy and reserved and scarce dared open my lips to any one i had none of that quickness and animation which are so much admired in children , but rather a silent unobtrusive way of observing things and events , and wishing to understand them better than @entity174 was not brought up by any body in particular that i know of			0
i had no training , no cultivation			0
the birds of the air , or beasts of the field are not freer from moral culture than i was			0
no one seemed to care for me till i was able to work , and then it was @entity5 do this and @entity5 do that , but i never complained as i found a sort of pleasure and something to divert my thoughts in employment			1
of my relatives i knew nothing			0
no one ever spoke of my father or mother , but i soon learned what a curse was attached to my race , soon learned that the @entity48 blood in my veins would forever exclude me from the higher walks of life			2
that toil unremitted unpaid toil must be my lot and portion , without even the hope or expectation of any thing better			0
this seemed the harder to be borne , because my complexion was almost white , and the obnoxious descent could not be readily traced , though it gave a rotundity to my person , a wave and curl to my hair , and perhaps led me to fancy pictorial illustrations and flaming colors.the busiest life has its leisure moments ; it was so with mine			2
i had from the first an instinctive desire for knowledge and the means of mental improvement			0
though neglected and a slave , i felt the immortal longings in me			2
in the absence of books and teachers and schools i determined to learn if not in a regular , approved , and scientific way			0
i was aware that this plan would meet with opposition , perhaps with punishment			0
my master never permitted his slaves to be taught			0
education in his view tended to enlarge and expand their ideas ; made them less subservient to their superiors , and besides that its blessings were destined to be conferred exclusively on the higher and nobler race			0
indeed though he was generally easy and good - tempered , there was nothing liberal or democratic in his nature			0
slaves were slaves to him , and nothing more			0
practically he regarded them not as men and women , but in the same light as horses or other domestic animals			0
he furnished supplied their necessities of food and clothing from the same motives of policy , but [ di ] scounted the ideas of equality and fraternity as preposterous and absurd			0
of course i had nothing to expect from him , yet ' where there 's a will there 's a way			2

in 1948 , a black history archivist found the manuscript for ' @entity6 ' a *semi-autobiographical* account of life as a house slave in @entity38
more than 50 years later in 2001 it was put up for auction but it 's author , @entity5 , remained a mystery
now a professor in @entity18 says he has traced crafts back to a female slave named @entity5 who served the house of @entity100 before escaping to @entity125
