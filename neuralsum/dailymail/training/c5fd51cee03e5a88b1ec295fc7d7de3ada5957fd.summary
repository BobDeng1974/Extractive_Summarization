by @entity0 @entity1 may have been furious with @entity2 after the @entity3 forward appeared to bite his shoulder on tuesday , but the @entity6 defender can now see the funny side			1
the @entity9 centre back was incensed when no action was taken by the referee as @entity12 were knocked out of the @entity13 in @entity14			0
but he has now posted a picture of a hotel maid biting his shoulder in much the same way as @entity2 while @entity14 striker @entity19 was snapped pretending to bite team - mate @entity21 's arm in training			1
' it is clear , clear - cut and then there was the obvious dive afterwards because he knew very well that he did something that he should nâ€™t have done			0
' @entity2 is a sneak and he gets away with it because @entity41 want their stars to play in the @entity13			1
' i 'd love to see if they have the courage to use video evidence against him			0
the referee saw the bite mark too , but he did nothing about it			2
' meanwhile , @entity41 's disciplinary hearing into the incident will continue on thursday morning , according to the head of the @entity55			2
the independent disciplinary committee met until late into the night without coming to a verdict on the case of the @entity60 striker who has been charged with misconduct			0
step 1 : @entity2 approaches @entity1 from behind during a @entity3 attack stage 2 : the @entity60 striker moves his head close to @entity1 's shoulder as he prepares to attack stage 3 : @entity2 appears to clamp his jaws down and bite @entity1 's shoulder @entity70 in another bite storm @entity3 @entity73 president @entity72 emerged from the @entity75 hotel in @entity76 shortly after midnight local time to say the hearing would continue on thursday			1
@entity72 said : ' we know they met for a long time but we do n't know if that means a good or a bad situation			0
they will continue in the morning			0
' @entity2 's lawyer @entity85 , who is also a @entity3 @entity73 board member travelled to @entity76 to defend the @entity60 striker and claimed there is a @entity88 campaign against him led by @entity89 and @entity12			1
an outcome is expected well ahead of @entity3 's match with @entity12 on saturday and @entity2 's sponsors including adidas are keeping a close eye on the verdict			1
the video evidence appears damning and one senior @entity41 official with experience of disciplinary cases , who asked to remain anonymous , believes the biting should be judged to be at least as serious as spitting , which carries a minimum six - game ban which would see @entity2 's @entity13 brought to an abrupt halt			2
however there are influential voices who are trying to bring pressure to bear for the player to be dealt with more leniently			0
according to @entity3 newspaper @entity112 , the most powerful figures in @entity111 gathered in the @entity75 to try to secure a much less severe sanction			2
shocking : @entity1 displays bite marks on his shoulder after the incident , but the referee was n't swayed these included @entity127 's long - standing vice-president @entity126 who is second only to @entity128 in the pecking order , the president of @entity123 @entity122 and his predecessor , @entity124 , who are both @entity125			1
the independent disciplinary panel , chaired by @entity132 lawyer @entity131 , has a range of sanctions available up to 24 - match ban or a two - year suspension from all football			0
a worldwide ban would impact on his playing for @entity60 but there is no precedent for such a sanction happening			0
it remains unclear whether @entity2 's previous biting bans - 10 games for biting @entity147 's @entity146 and seven matches for biting @entity150 's @entity149 - would be taken into consideration , but the panel do have that power if they wish			2
a @entity41 spokeswoman said : ' they can take in all elements they deem necessary			0
' @entity2 has not appeared in person at the disciplinary hearing			1
there are also reports that the @entity3 @entity73 are claiming pictures of teeth - marks on @entity1 's shoulder were digitally altered			1
trouble ahead : @entity41 will continue to discuss disciplinary proceedings against @entity2 on thursday @entity70 hands @entity60 problem			1

@entity1 was furious after @entity2 appeared to bite him on tuesday
but he saw the funny side when a maid pretended to do the same
@entity2 is expected to discover his fate on thursday
@entity3 striker could be banned for up to two years
