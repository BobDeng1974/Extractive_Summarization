by @entity0 a woman in @entity2 has launched a campaign to get a stretch of @entity6 ’s coastline designated as a nudist zone			2
@entity8 , 19 , started the petition for the naked sunbathing zone on campaigning website @entity11			1
in the petition , ms @entity8 appeals to @entity15 mayor @entity14 to designate around one quarter of the @entity19 city 's coastline as ‘ clothing optional ’			1
making waves : @entity6 boasts around four miles of sandy beaches and ms @entity8 wants the mayor to devote one mile of this to nudist sunbathers the online petition needs 2,500 signatures and has so far attracted over 1,700			1
on @entity11 's website , ms @entity8 writes : ‘ the practice of nudism is purposely nonsexual			1
it serves as a personal comfort and a stronger sense of freedom			0
' there is the belief that nudism helps with self - esteem , relaxation , and overall well - being			1
’ @entity6 city boasts around four miles of sandy beaches and ms @entity8 wants the mayor to devote one mile of this to nudist sunbathers , leaving over three miles as ‘ clothing required ’			1
daring to bare : @entity44 is the only beach in @entity2 where nude sunbathing is officially allowed ‘ in this we give way for everyone to go to the beach however they choose ' , she explains			0
' as many will want to go to a clothing - required beach , they will definitely have the choice within more than 3.1 miles of land , not to mention @entity57 and other surrounding beaches as well ; and for those who recommend clothing optional , they may now have the option also			1
’ @entity44 is currently the only beach in @entity2 where nude sunbathing is officially allowed but sunbathers dare to bare on several other beaches in the @entity2 , including @entity64 , @entity65 and @entity67 beach			0

no tan lines here : @entity8 wants @entity6 sunbathers to be able to go skinny dipping as they do on @entity44 she told @entity80 : ‘ it ’s out of the way a little bit because it was hard to find someone with a big enough yard and on private land			2
' but mr @entity14 dismissed the idea in an interview with @entity88 : ‘ quite frankly , it 's contrary to the objectives of creating a family - friendly @entity6			0
‘ my recommendation to anyone who would do that is to find some private property somewhere where you can do that			0
’ he referred to the fact that there were several topless and nude beaches in @entity102 and said that @entity19 sailors looked forward to visiting them			0
but when they got there they discovered not models but members of the general public , aged from six to 60 , which he said was ' not quite as pleasant as you might think ' .			0
