hospital consultant professor @entity0 warned financial incentives for hospitals to put patients on the @entity4 could influence the work of doctors hospitals are paid millions to hit targets for the number of patients who die on the @entity4 , the @entity7 can reveal			1
the incentives have been paid to hospitals that ensure a set percentage of patients who die on their wards have been put on the controversial regime			1
in some cases , hospitals have been set targets that between a third and two thirds of all the deaths should be on the @entity4 , which critics say is a way of hastening the deaths of terminally ill patients			1
at least £ 30million in extra money from taxpayers is estimated to have been handed to hospitals over the past three years to achieve these goals			1
critics of the method warned last night that financial incentives for hospitals could influence the work of doctors			1
the @entity4 involves withdrawal of life - saving treatment			2
patients are sedated and most are denied nutrition and fluids by tube			0
on average a patient put on the @entity4 dies within 29 hours			2
one of the leading critics , hospital consultant professor @entity0 , said : ' given the fact that the diagnosis of impending death is such a subjective one , putting a financial incentive into the mix is really not a good idea and it could sway the decision - making process			2
' @entity4 is thought to be used in more than 100,000 cases a year			2
yesterday the @entity49 , which represents doctors working in hospices and on specialist hospital wards , announced it is organising an inquiry into the method			0
the @entity4 is intended to ease the final hours of patients who are close to death and to spare them the suffering associated with invasive treatment			0
payments to hospitals to introduce it are made through a system called @entity63 , or @entity64 , which channels money to hospital trusts through @entity68 ' commissioners '			0
the use of @entity64 payments to encourage the spread of the @entity4 through the wards and to persuade doctors to meet pathway targets was revealed in answers to @entity77 requests			1
among trusts that confirmed the use of targets was @entity81 , which said that in the financial year which ended in march the percentage of patients who died on the @entity4 was ' 43 per cent against a target of 35 per cent '			1
over the year the @entity81 received £ 308,000 for achieving ' goals involving the @entity4 '			1
@entity88 had @entity64 payments connected to the @entity4 almost halved after failing to reach targets			0
( file picture ) controversial : the @entity4 is intended to ease the final hours of patients who are close to death and to spare them the suffering associated with invasive treatment figures show @entity88 had @entity64 payments connected to the @entity4 almost halved after failing to reach targets the @entity81 was offered £ 73,385 for increasing numbers of patients who die at home rather than in hospital			1
part of the scheme was a target for the number of patients discharged from hospital to die at home after being put on the @entity4			1
this would have paid £ 36,392 if a 47.6 per cent target had been reached			0
its @entity77 statement said : ' @entity109 achieved 45.5 per cent so funding for the @entity4 element was reduced to £ 18,600			2
' ' given the fact that the diagnosis of impending death is such a subjective one , putting a financial incentive into the mix is really not a good idea and it could sway the decision - making process			0
' professor @entity0 @entity77 replies so far received by the @entity7 suggest that if the money paid by @entity68 commissioners were spread equally around all @entity68 acute hospitals , it would mean £ 30million has been sunk into the campaign to put the @entity4 into universal use since 2009			1
the @entity126 defended lcp payments by target last night			0
a spokesman said : ' it is right local areas try to improve the care and support offered to dying people as it means patients are more comfortable and treated with dignity in their final days and hours			0
' we are clear the @entity4 can only work if each patient is fully consulted , where this is feasible , and their family involved in all aspects of decision - making			2
staff must properly communicate with the patient and their family – any failure to do so is unacceptable			0
' but dr @entity146 , chairman of the @entity148 pressure group said : ' if death is accelerated by a single day that will save the @entity68 nearly £ 200 – that is the estimated cost of a patient per day in hospital			0
' my position on the @entity4 is that it is inherently dangerous and unnecessary			0

some hospitals set target of two thirds of all deaths should be on @entity4
at least £ 30m in extra money handed to hospitals to achieve these goals
