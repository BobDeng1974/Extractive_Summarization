@entity1 fans upset at the @entity2 for switching the extra loyalty value of attending matches from away games to @entity6 will be infuriated at the way their appeal over the change has been ignored			1
the @entity2 intend to carry on regardless awarding two caps to their @entity1 club members for coming to home games and one cap for trips abroad			1
for years it had been the other way round for the loyalty league table that will next be used to allocate @entity2 tickets for what will be a hugely over-subscribed @entity21			1
@entity1 supporters have chanted their upset - ‘ two caps for @entity6 , you ’re having a laugh ’ - at every international game since the @entity27 and the matter was raised by fans chief @entity29 at the last @entity2 council meeting			1
@entity1 fans are unhappy with the @entity2 's move to switch loyalty value of attending away games to @entity6 @entity1 supporters who attended @entity1 's friendly in @entity33 will have earned just one cap for the trip the @entity2 board said they noted @entity29 ’s concern			1
but rather than look fully into whether they had made the right decision , the @entity2 are staying on the same course			1
they claim that the hardcore loyal support who go to home and away games are not being disadvantaged and that filling @entity6 is the over-riding priority			1
@entity1 fans ambassador @entity46 said : ‘ we have appealed in the right way through our council representative and it will be disappointing in the extreme if our complaints are effectively ignored			1
the @entity2 have not heard the last about this			1
’ @entity54 shoots and scores during @entity1 's 1 - 1 draw against @entity33 at the @entity57 @entity58 , who pulled their @entity1 rugby sponsorship after boorish behaviour by the players on a company day during the @entity65 fiasco in @entity66 , have purposely made their tournament sponsorship in 2015 grass - roots related			1
yet @entity58 still felt the need to spice up their launch match between two amateur sides at @entity72 by inviting along rugby celebrities sir @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 and @entity77			2
and so much for grass - roots delivery — all the junior and mini-rugby sessions were cancelled so committee members could meet the big names			0
@entity58 , sponsors of next year 's @entity27 , invited @entity75 to their launch match @entity86 , the @entity87 president charged with cleaning up rotten cycling , faces a difficult day on thursday			0
@entity87 ’s licence commission meet to discuss his recommendation to withdraw leading team @entity91 ’s elite competition licence following major doping offences by their riders			0
drug - riddled @entity91 are expected to take their case to the @entity96 if they lose their permit			0
they will claim @entity86 has not followed the correct legal procedure as there is nothing in the @entity87 statutes about withdrawing team licences for rider transgressions			0
potentially , @entity91 — backed by the @entity105 sovereign wealth fund — could then sue the @entity87 for massive damages if their appeal is upheld by @entity96			0
@entity109 club @entity108 have tenuous links with the @entity1 team through being the first professional clubs of @entity113 and @entity114			2
and they are now in the unlikely position of having their chief executive of 10 days @entity118 on the @entity2 international committee			2
@entity118 was in @entity120 on tuesday night as an @entity2 representative			2
@entity118 , pictured during his spell as a @entity124 player , is on the @entity2 international committee @entity127 ’ @entity126 pay - off the size of @entity127 ' six - figure pay - off from the @entity126 after walking out as chief executive of @entity132 2015 points to @entity135 ’s high command wanting her out — even if she made the first move			2
it is understood the breakdown of @entity127 ’ relationships with the @entity126 leadership included those with affable chairman @entity142 as well as chief executive @entity143			0
@entity127 received a pay - off after walking out as chief executive of @entity132 2015 it is said @entity127 had been thinking about leaving since @entity146 , such was the disconnect			0
so there would have been time to ensure she did not depart @entity151 empty - handed and her believed £ 150,000 severance payment reflects tournament preparations going well			0
the last big split before the @entity127 affair in which both sides kept this quiet followed @entity158 ’ sacking as @entity160 ’s lead football presenter			0
@entity158 has still not spoken out about losing his prime sports host role to @entity162 , despite having settled his pay - off terms with @entity160 .			0

the @entity2 intend to carry on despite fans ' appeals over the change
