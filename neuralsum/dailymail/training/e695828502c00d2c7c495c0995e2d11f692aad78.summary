notorious hate preacher @entity6 is considered such a threat that he will be permitted to roam the streets for only two hours a day			1
but mr @entity9 ruled that he must be allowed to walk his youngest child to school under his bail conditions			1
it raises the prospect of parents at the school gates bumping into the radical cleric , who was known as @entity19 ’s ambassador in @entity20			2

@entity29 has spent much of the past decade in a high - security prison and has cost taxpayers more than £ 1million in benefits , prison costs and legal fees			1
ministers are attempting to deport him to @entity39 to stand trial on terror charges , but three weeks ago they were blocked by @entity20 human rights judges			2
yesterday government lawyers argued the fanatic should remain in prison while they continue efforts to remove him and insisted he presented an ‘ unusually significant risk to the @entity50 ’			1
but the @entity51 ruled he should be released on bail , to resume his life with his wife and five children			1
@entity39 authorities released this picture of @entity29 ( left ) in 2008 under his name of @entity6			1

meetings with anyone other than his immediate family will have to be approved by security officials			2
if he breaks the conditions , he could be back behind bars within hours			2
officials do not consider it likely that @entity29 will take part in the planning of a terrorist attack or other operational activities			1
however , it is feared he could use the internet to give justification for attacks overseas or in @entity50			2
officials want to prevent this happening by banning him from having a mobile phone or access to the internet , where his sermons could be uploaded on to extremist websites			0
@entity29 is currently being held at the category a long lartin prison , but after a judge 's ruling will walk free within days in evidence it was claimed that home secretary @entity106 ( pictured ) does not accept that @entity29 's detention was unlawful @entity29 ’s strict curfew also reflects the fact that he has , in the past , been accused of terrorist fundraising			1
he was found to have £ 170,000 cash in his possession , including £ 805 in an envelope marked ‘ for the mujahedin in @entity117 ’			0

in his ruling , mr @entity9 said @entity29 ’s bail conditions could be relaxed within three months unless @entity50 makes ‘ demonstrable progress ’ in negotiations to send the 52 - year - old home			1
last month , judges in @entity130 ruled that @entity29 could not be deported in case evidence obtained from torture was used against him at trial in @entity39			1
@entity50 diplomats are trying to extract assurances that this will not happen			0
attorney general @entity137 said the government was bound by the rule of law ' as much as anybody else '			0
he told the @entity142 4 today programme : ' the government is obviously very concerned about this case and very much wishes to see @entity6 deported to @entity39 and , when he is in @entity39 , tried fairly if the @entity39 authorities wish to put him on trial			0
' he can not be deported unless the assurances which are required following the judgment in the @entity149 can be secured			0
' a @entity151 spokesman said : ‘ @entity29 should remain in detention , our view has not changed			1
that is the argument we made to the court today and we disagree with its decision			0
‘ this is a dangerous man who we believe poses a real threat to our security and who has not changed in his views or attitude to the @entity50			1
’ @entity165 , chairman of the @entity166 , said most people would be ‘ astonished by this decision considering @entity6 is wanted on terrorism charges in eight countries ’			0
shadow home secretary @entity171 said : ‘ the home secretary needs to explain urgently what action she is taking on the national security implications of this judgment			1
‘ @entity6 should face terror charges in @entity39 , and the home secretary needs to urgently accelerate discussions to make that possible			1
’ @entity179 of the @entity180 , a foreign policy think tank , said : ‘ today ’s decision is a disgrace			0
but , if @entity6 is to be released , the government should place him under a @entity186 and @entity185 , the successor to control orders			2
he is far too important an @entity190 ideologue not to be under surveillance			0
’ @entity29 , also known as @entity6 , featured in hate sermons found on videos in the flat of a september 11 bomber			1
the @entity149 in @entity130 has overruled every court in @entity50 in ruling that @entity6 can stay in @entity50 @entity6 has variously been described as ' @entity190 's spiritual leader in @entity20 ' , ' @entity19 's right - hand man in @entity20 ' , ' the most significant extremist preacher in the @entity50 ' and ' a truly dangerous individual '			1
the @entity39 father of five , whose real name is @entity203 , claimed asylum when he arrived in @entity50 in september 1993 on a forged passport			0
he was allowed to stay and preach his extremism , and was accused of calling on @entity50 muslims to martyr themselves in a holy war on ' oppression '			0
a 1995 ' fatwa ' he issued justified the killing of converts from @entity214 , their wives and children in @entity217			0
in october 1999 a sermon in @entity73 called for the killing of @entity220 and praised attacks on @entity222			0
and the same year he was convicted in his absence of planning terror attacks in @entity39			0

videos of his sermons were found in the @entity233 flat used by some of the 9/11 hijackers			0

after 10 months on the run he was discovered in a council house in south @entity73 , arrested and taken to @entity248 high - security prison			0
@entity29 was released in march 2005 and put under a 22 - hour home curfew designed to limit contact with other extremists			1

as the court battle continued , @entity6 was released in june 2008 to live in his £ 800,000 council house in west @entity73 before being rearrested that november over fears he would breach his bail conditions			2
in 2008 , the @entity261 ruled in @entity29 's favour , saying there were reasonable grounds for believing he would be denied a fair trial in @entity39 because evidence against him could have been extracted through torture			2
but in a landmark judgment in february 2009 , five @entity268 unanimously backed the government 's policy of removing terror suspects from @entity50 on the basis of assurances from foreign governments			0
lord @entity276 , now president of the @entity277 , went further , saying that evidence of torture in another country ' does not require the @entity50 to retain in this country , to the detriment of national security , a terrorist suspect '			0
