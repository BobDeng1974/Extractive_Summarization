a @entity1 loving couple visited a total of three @entity4 theme parks in one day , taking them on an incredible whistle stop tour of the globe			2
@entity8 , 49 , and @entity9 , 51 , from @entity10 , spent 28 hours travelling 7,900 - miles to @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13			1
beginning at 9.50am in @entity14 , the pair , who celebrate their wedding anniversary at the theme park every year , managed a quick snap in front of @entity21 , then boarded a 10 - hour flight to @entity23			1
@entity8 and @entity9 spent 28 hours travelling 7,900 - miles to @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 they had struggled to decide between visiting @entity14 and @entity25 , in @entity26 , so they chose to do both - stopping at @entity14 , in @entity12 , in between			1
the mission could only be accomplished on days when the @entity29 in @entity13 was open until midnight			2
and even though they arrived in @entity26 an hour later than expected , the @entity30 reached @entity14 just after noon , posed for a picture and raced to @entity33 's @entity32			0
but tension mounted when they missed their flight to @entity26 and the pair thought they 'd never make it in time to see all three parks			0
thankfully they were ushered onto the next available flight and made it to @entity25 , @entity26 at 11.40pm - just twenty minutes before their deadline			0
romantic : every year the couple spend their wedding anniversary at @entity14 , in @entity12 ' exhausted ' : @entity49 tweeted about the adventure , telling friends it was ' fun but really insane ' the couple at @entity54 in @entity55 , @entity12 , left , and arriving at @entity25 in @entity26 despite the travel time being 28 hours - @entity11 is 14 hours behind @entity26 , which meant that technically , they visited all three parks in a day			1
' the best thing was doing it with my wife and best friend , ' @entity49 wrote on @entity64			0
' having her by my side for the whole thing made it special			0
' ' it 's completely insane , and that 's why we did it , ' @entity8 told the @entity73 .			2
