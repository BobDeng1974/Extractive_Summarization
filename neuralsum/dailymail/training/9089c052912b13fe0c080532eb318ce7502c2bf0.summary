@entity0 hopes a new low cost laptop could tempt buyers away from new tablets from @entity4 and @entity5			1
the lightweight computer will sell for £ 229 ( $ 249 ) and is being made with @entity7			0
it was revealed just days before @entity4 is expected to unveil a low cost version of its @entity11 tablet , and @entity5 and @entity12 begin selling their tablet computers			1
see the computer in action below @entity0 has launched an aggressive advertising campaign for its new laptop , claiming the £ 229 machine is ' for everyone ' unlike a traditional laptop , the @entity20 has no hard drive , instead keeping all of its information on @entity0 's servers			1
this means that while most functions can still be used without an internet connection , some are limited			0
@entity0 also supplies a virtual drive for the machine , which users can also access from a desktop @entity33 and even their mobile phone			2
the @entity0 machine 's software is based on @entity0 's @entity38 web browser			1
like other so - called @entity40 , this laptop does n't have a hard drive , instead storing information on @entity0 's internet servers			1
the machine in the latest @entity20 , a line @entity0 first released two years ago			2
it will go on sale early next week in @entity48 stores in @entity49 and more than 500 @entity51 stores in the @entity52 ' this is a big step in the journey for us , ' said @entity56 , @entity0 's senior vice president of @entity38 and apps			1
' i think it 's generally an exciting time in the computing industry			0
' like tablets , the discount @entity20 will rely on a computer chip design known as @entity64 , instead of @entity66 microprocessors			0
the @entity64 architecture is more energy efficient , extending the duration of batteries between charges			0
with an 11.6 - inch ( 29.46 - centimeter ) screen , the new @entity40 also will have a larger display than tablets selling in the same price range			0
the @entity20 launch comes as @entity0 suffered the single largest plunge in stock market history on thursday when $ 24billion ( £ 15billion ) was wiped off the company 's value after its results were accidentally released			2
the catastrophic error revealed that profits were down by 20 per cent			0
trading in the company 's stock was halted when its shares fell by nine per cent in just eight minutes following the release of its disappointing earnings report			0
the report was leaked ahead of schedule when a printing firm working for @entity0 put out an incomplete press release without authorisation from the online giant			2
the plunge prompted worries that a second dot.com crash could be on the way			0
@entity0 's troubles coincide with a steady fall in @entity104 's share price and the ongoing struggles of newer start - ups such as @entity107 and @entity108			1
@entity0 's third - quarter profits fell 20 per cent on a year earlier to $ 2.18billion ( £ 1.35billion ) - well below analysts ' expectations			1
the dire results were due to be issued after the markets had finished trading for the day			0
but because they were released early , investors were able to dump their stock and send the shares into a nosedive			0
the laptops will be set up to automatically use all of @entity0 's services , including its search engine , @entity123 and @entity124 video site			1
because the laptop lacks a hard drive , @entity0 also is offering 100 gigabytes of free storage on computers kept in its eight data centers			1
those remote computers provide the backbone for @entity0 's online storage service , @entity133			1
@entity56 , senior vice president of @entity38 at @entity0 , unveiling the machine in @entity135 however , despite the low price , experts say the new @entity20 will face a tough time winning over consumers because it is n't set up like a traditional pc with a hard drive , said @entity143 analyst @entity142			1
' a lot of people are going to see it and think , ` once i have it , what exactly do i do with it ? " ' @entity142 said			0
@entity0 , which is based in @entity151 , @entity152 , will try to educate and woo prospective buyers by setting up @entity20 kiosks in @entity51 stores where staff will be on hand to field questions			2
the company also will promote the new @entity20 in television ads. the attempt to grab a few early headlines thursday backfired , though , when @entity0 prematurely released its third - quarter earnings while the company was providing a preview of the low - priced @entity20 to a group of reporters			2
the @entity20 for the user , the main difference between @entity0 's laptop and others is the fact that everything is done within @entity0 's @entity38			1
the laptops are set up to automatically use all of @entity0 's services , including its search engine , @entity123 and @entity124 video site			1
@entity0 also offers online spreadsheets , word processing and other office applications			2
because the laptop lacks a hard drive , @entity0 also is offering 100 gigabytes of free storage on computers kept in its eight data centers			1
those remote computers provide the backbone for @entity0 's online storage service , @entity133			1
with an 11.6 - inch ( 29.46 - centimeter ) screen , the new @entity20 's have a larger display than tablets selling in the same price range , and also boast a real keyboard			2
the @entity20 is a very different type of machine - and @entity0 's biggest issue will be whether it can easily explain how it works to consumers			1
once the earnings slipped out , some reporters bolted from the laptop presentation to focus on numbers that disappointed investors			0
@entity0 appears to be trying to beat @entity5 and @entity4 to the punch with the discount @entity20			2
@entity5 is poised to release @entity204 8 , a dramatic makeover of its famous operating system , on oct. 26			0
the long - awaited makeover is designed to run on touch - based tablets , as well as laptop and desktop computers			0
a variety of manufacturers will be selling a hodgepodge of @entity215 - powered personal computers and tablets			0
@entity4 says it plans to show off a new product tuesday			0
the event is widely expected to be the coming - out party for a slightly smaller version of its hot - selling @entity11			0
the mini @entity11 is expected to feature a 7.85 - inch ( 19.94 - centimeter ) screen compared to the nearly 10 - inch ( 25.4 - centimeter ) screen of the pioneering @entity11			0
industry analysts expect @entity4 to price a smaller ipad in the $ 249 to $ 299 range in an effort to siphon sales away from other scaled - down tablets , such as @entity0 's @entity230 and @entity12 's @entity231 .			1
