@entity0 face the ignominy of being relegated to a third - placed @entity3 seeding for next season ’s competition if they do n’t beat @entity7 at home on tuesday night			1
@entity10 ’s side need victory over the @entity13 champions at the @entity14 to have any hope at all of qualifying for the next stage of the tournament after losing two games and drawing two so far			1
however , @entity0 also need to make sure that if they do n’t qualify then they at least finish third in the group and go in to the @entity21			0
if they were to finish bottom , they will be in grave danger of seeing their coefficient dropping so low that they would go back to being a third seed in next summer ’s draw			0
this time they were a second seed and that saw them handed a group that should – in theory at least – have been a little easier			0
failure to beat @entity50 at home and just one point from six against @entity53 , however , has left @entity10 ’s team in dire straits ahead of their game against @entity58 ’s outfit			2
it is expected that @entity60 will change the seeding system a little for next year ’s competition , with the winners of the @entity3 and also the winners of each of @entity60 ’s top seven leagues automatically receiving top seed status			2
@entity0 , though , would need to overhaul @entity68 and win the @entity38 for that to be relevant			0
@entity70 and former @entity7 man @entity71 ( left ) share a joke during training city were beaten 1 - 0 when they last played @entity7 - former player @entity75 scored the winner the @entity30 champions train in @entity78 ahead of their clash at the @entity14			1

@entity0 have *n't* won a @entity3 game in 2014 - 15
@entity10 's side are in danger of dropping down a seeding
city face @entity30 *giants* @entity7 on tuesday night
