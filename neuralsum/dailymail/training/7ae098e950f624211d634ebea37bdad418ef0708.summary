@entity1 boss @entity0 admits @entity3 's new contract will not stop the speculation about his future			1
@entity3 signed a one - year contract extension on wednesday that will keep him at the @entity7 until june 2018 after proving to be a huge hit since his club record Â£ 12million move from @entity12 club @entity11 in the summer of 2013			1
the @entity14 striker - who scored 25 goals in his first season in @entity18 football and has another four so far this term - has been linked with @entity20 and @entity21 in the past and @entity0 accepts that speculation will always exist if the 25 - year - old keeps on performing			1
@entity14 striker @entity3 has signed a new deal to stay at the @entity7 until 2018 @entity3 has scored four goals for @entity1 so far this season after netting 25 times last term ' it 's just reward for what he 's been doing since he joined us and it 's a boost for the club and the fans but also for his team - mates , ' @entity0 said at his press conference ahead of saturday 's @entity39 game at @entity40			1
' he 's been very important on and off the pitch but he shows the commitment that the club have shown him in offering him a new deal			0
' the club deserves it too and him signing it shows clear indication he wants to be here and part of this team , training with the players he 's training with			0
' but i do n't think any contract you sign will stop speculation and being linked with anyone			2
' we ca n't stop speculation whether it 's a one - year or 20 - year contract but that 's not our problem			1
' my problem is to try and sign the players we want on long - term contracts for as long as possible			2
' @entity3 could actually miss as many as six games for @entity1 in january and february following the @entity14 's qualification this week for the @entity66 finals in @entity67			1
but @entity3 will be available after the @entity14 's goalless draw against @entity69 which secured @entity71 qualification for the trip to the @entity73 - a ground where @entity1 have yet to score in the @entity39 , let alone collect a point			1
@entity1 manager @entity0 accepts that speculation over his star striker 's future will continue the @entity14 's gaolless draw against @entity69 could see @entity3 ( c ) miss six games for @entity1 next year @entity40 have injuries to key players this weekend with @entity83 and @entity84 ruled out by injury and captain @entity86 and @entity87 also struggling to make @entity1 's visit			1
but @entity0 said : ' the players they 've got to come in would get in most sides in the league			2
' they are very strong as well and probably look at this as a chance to get three points but , hopefully , we can put on a performance to try and warrant points for ourselves			0
' it 's a tough place to go as they 've got an extremely good squad and are defending champions			0
' but the players relish these games to see how far they 've come as individuals and a group			0
' we can see how far we have come in these games and this is another chance to do that			0
' @entity1 climbed into the top five before the international break with an excellent 2 - 1 comeback home victory over @entity20 but @entity0 said no - one was getting carried away at the @entity7 with the start they have made this season			1
' we just focus on the next game because if you look too far ahead you lose track of what you 're doing , ' @entity0 said			2
' we 're just looking at @entity40 and giving that 100 per cent commitment and effort and see where that takes us			0
@entity123 celebrates scoring the winner against @entity20 that took @entity1 to fifth in the table ' who knows if we can stay in the top six			2
you obviously look at the tables but my focus is on attacking every single game as best we can			0
' we want to get the best performances and hopefully that will get us enough points to stay in the top half of the table and see where that takes us			0
' we 're realistic and teams below us are very powerful financially , but all i care is we compete against these teams and we 're competing so far			0
