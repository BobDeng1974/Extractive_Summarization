by @entity0 published : 06:46 est , 18 february 2014 @entity2 : 09:04 est , 18 february 2014 hosted in a darkened @entity7 warehouse and set to the thumping roar of a live , heavy metal duo , @entity5 's @entity4 collection was always going to be quite left - of - centre			2
the entire front row was decked out in @entity12 beanies that had been provided in their goodie bags , and before the action kicked off there were hushed whispers as to whether @entity20 's half - sister @entity18 was modelling or not			1
strobe lights welcomed a-list models , who stomped down the runway in a flurry of oranges , cobalt blues and greys			0
in fact , the modelling collective was more star - studded than the front row , featuring the likes of @entity33 , @entity34 and - the rumours were true - keeping up with the @entity37 star @entity18			1
the collection itself proved more extrordinary than many others seen on the runway , as @entity5 included two entirely machine - washable pieces			1
working with @entity60 , @entity5 started his machine - washable revolution last @entity62 , showcasing seven such dresses in @entity64 , saying that he wants to change the landscape of clothing care			1
' my role with @entity60 is to challenge the pre-conceived ideas of what can be put inside a washing machine , and that means creating designs using future fabrics which can take centre stage on the runway and be cared for once they are inside a wardrobe			0
' @entity5 added that he has n't had to let his design quality slip in order to make the clothes machine - washable			1
@entity81 studded catwalk : @entity83 , left , and @entity20 star @entity18 , right he continued : ' since starting as @entity60 's global fashion consultant i have had my eyes opened to the future of fabric care and wash technology , i have worked with specific mills who have enabled the process to retain the essential " @entity5 " elements without compromising at all			2
' you 'd be hard - pressed to guess which items in the collection were machine - washable , but one piece included a tunic worn by @entity33			1
highlights of the collection included a humming bird - print dress ( that also came in a machine - washable version ) oversized orange knits , and one particular little black dress that was embellished with hundreds of black and white beetles			1
it 's us ! @entity83 recorded the models ' finale walk in a video selfie from the runway and these were pieces of which the designer himself was pretty fond , with @entity5 having remarked : ' my favourite pieces are the kingfisher print and embroideries and the lilly bug dresses '			1
despite having some of the most influential and charismatic models gracing his catwalk , @entity5 never has a particular muse in mind when designing his collections			0
' i never have one specific muse , i much prefer the idea of lots of different fantastic characters and characteristics			0
from a visual perspective , i was interested in the melancholy of nature viewed through a technological mindset			0
' keeping up with a @entity20 : @entity18 backstage at last night 's @entity5 show front row ladies : @entity137 , left , and @entity138 , right , were guests on the @entity5 front row but @entity5 does have a good idea of what sort of woman might wear his clothes			2
' the @entity5 girl is one who enjoys fashion and is partial to some accessible flamboyance and eccentricity , ' he said			0
there was certainly a feel of flamboyancy in the room , with strobe lighting and on - catwalk selfies			0
even the finale differed from its competitors , with @entity5 sending models down in groups of three rather than in a continual line			0
@entity34 's trio was the one captured in her three - way video selfie			2
made in @entity163 's @entity162 , who sat in the front row , said of the show : ' it had a great vibe but it was also very wearable			0

@entity5 ' collection included two machine - washable pieces
front row had @entity173 and the @entity174 in goodie bags to wear
models included @entity83 , @entity33 and @entity18
@entity34 documented models ' finale with ' world - first ' runway video selfie
