the @entity2 administration has banned federal law enforcement from profiling on the basis of religion , national origin and other characteristics , it was announced on monday			1
the @entity8 hopes the protocols could be a model for local departments as the nation tackles questions about the role race plays in policing			0
the policy , which expands decade - old guidelines established under the @entity19 administration , also will require new training and data collection			0
civil rights advocates said they welcomed the broader protections , but were disappointed that the guidelines will exempt security screening in airports and border checkpoints and wo n't be binding on local and state police agencies			1
' particularly in light of certain recent incidents we 've seen at the local level - and the widespread concerns about trust in the criminal justice process which so many have raised throughout the nation â€” it 's imperative that we take every possible action to institute strong and sound policing practices , ' said attorney general @entity68 , referring to the august shooting by a white police officer of unarmed black teen @entity71 in @entity72 , @entity73 , and the chokehold death weeks earlier of @entity75 in @entity76			1
local grand juries declined to indict either officer			0
the @entity8 is investigating both cases			0
the guidelines cover federal agencies within the @entity8 , including the @entity82 , the @entity83 and the @entity84			2
they also extend to local and state officers serving on joint task forces alongside federal agents			2
their practical impact remains to be seen , especially since local police officers are the ones primarily responsible for traffic stops , 911 calls and day - to - day interactions with the communities they patrol			1
@entity38 attorney general @entity68 , pictured last week , said that he expected the new guidelines , which apply to federal law enforcement but not local police officers , would be announced in coming days but the @entity2 administration envisions the rules as a possible road map for local police , with @entity68 expected to brief local law enforcement officials monday to encourage them to adopt the federal guidelines			1
@entity68 , who has made the release of the guidelines a priority before leaving the @entity8 next year , called the guidelines a ' major and important step forward to ensure effective policing ' by federal law enforcement			1
the guidelines extend a ban on routine racial profiling that the @entity8 announced in 2003 under then - attorney general @entity117			1
civil rights groups have long said those rules left open too many loopholes by allowing an exemption for national security and border investigations and by failing to extend the ban to characteristics beyond race and ethnicity			1
the new guidelines would end the carve - out on national security and border investigations and widen the profiling ban to prohibit the practice on the basis of religion , national origin , gender , sexual orientation and gender identity - though agents would still be able to consider those factors if they had information linking a person of that characteristic to a specific crime or threat			0
still , the new protocols allow for significant exemptions , including some for @entity147 officials who screen passengers at airports and do inspections at the border			0
@entity147 officials argued for the exemptions on the basis of what they said was ' the unique nature of border and transportation security as compared to traditional law enforcement '			1
' this does not mean that officers and agents are free to profile , ' the department said in a statement			0
' to the contrary , @entity147 ' existing policies make it categorically clear that profiling is prohibited , ' while allowing for limited circumstances in which race , ethnicity and other characteristics could be considered			0
the @entity172 objected to those exemptions			0
' it 's so loosely drafted that its exceptions risk swallowing any rule and permit some of the worst law enforcement policies and practices that have victimized and alienated @entity180 and other minority communities , ' said @entity182 , director of the @entity172 's @entity183			2
' this guidance is not an adequate response to the crisis of racial profiling in @entity38			0
' the department said other activities , such as civil immigration enforcement and @entity192 law enforcement actions , would still be covered unarmed 18 - year - old @entity71 ( left ) was shot and killed by a white cop in @entity72 , @entity73 in august weeks after the chokehold death of @entity75 by a white cop in @entity76			2

civil rights advocates said they were disappointed that the guidelines wo n't be binding on local and state police agencies
their impact remains to be seen , especially since local cops are responsible for traffic stops , 911 calls and day - to - day interactions on patrol
the limits will not extend to border or airport screenings
attorney general @entity68 is expected to brief local law enforcement officials on monday to encourage them to adopt the federal guidelines
