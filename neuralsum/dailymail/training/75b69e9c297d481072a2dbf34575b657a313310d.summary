by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 12:34 est , 16 january 2013 updated : 12:59 est , 16 january 2013 education secretary @entity2 was accused of being ' deeply frustrating ' to work with by former children 's minister @entity3 education secretary @entity2 was today accused of running his ministry like the department store in seventies sitcom @entity6 ? @entity3 accused education secretary @entity2 , his old boss , of behaving like @entity8 mr @entity7 , the out - of - touch department store owner in the comedy who barely knew the people who worked for him			1
and the former children ’s minister slammed the ‘ declining ’ priority given to children and families ' issues , accusing mr @entity2 of ‘ complete radio silence ’ on the subject			1
giving evidence to the @entity20 , mr @entity3 painted a devastating picture of the @entity22 ( @entity22 ) as inefficient and bureaucratic with an ‘ upstairs downstairs mentality ’			1
‘ most officials have never met the @entity25 other than when he will troop out a few chosen people for the new year party , mr @entity28 - like from @entity30 , and tell us we 've all done terribly well and then disappear , ’ he said			2
‘ that is no way to run an important department			2
it is terribly anachronistic , terribly bureaucratic , terribly formal			0
’ mr @entity3 said that when he was a minister , children and families had been a ‘ declining priority ’ within the @entity22 , which appeared to have been further ‘ downgraded ’ since the reshuffle last september			1
‘ there is a particular area around child exploitation where the department seems to have gone on complete radio silence at a time when sexual abuse of children has never had a higher profile in public consciousness and the media @entity50 , ’ he said			1
mr @entity3 said mr @entity2 was like the elderly @entity8 mr @entity7 ( centre ) in 1970s sitcom @entity53 who rarely met or visited those working on the shop floor ‘ that is deeply , deeply worrying and i hope that does n't signify any downgrading of the priority that it absolutely is			1
’ he said that when he became a minister he had been alarmed to discover that many of the officials in the @entity22 responsible for drawing up child protection regulations had never even met a social worker			1
‘ these were people who were drawing up the regulations , who were responsible for government safeguarding policy ... and too many people working in the @entity22 had never actually been out with a social worker before , which i found alarming , ’ he said			0
there was a culture of not answering questions properly at the department , mr @entity3 told mps ‘ if the department is going to be a delivery department , we need to have more people who actually know about the job and what it delivers rather than producing a nice glossy brochure and thinking that that 's the end of the story			1
’ mr @entity3 also complained ministers never met without civil servants present and that the weekly ministerial meeting was frequently either cancelled or attended by ‘ a cast of thousands ’ which made it impossible to discuss strategic thinking			1
mr @entity3 also complained ministers never met without civil servants present and that the weekly ministerial meeting was frequently either cancelled or attended by " a cast of thousands " which made it impossible to discuss strategic thinking			1
' too often one was having to double guess what the boss ( mr @entity2 ) might think			1
it was deeply frustrating , ' he said			0
at the same time the way the department worked was ' deeply inefficient ' , with ministers denied open access to the officials working for them			2
' there is a bit of an upstairs downstairs mentality			0
the ministers were all posted on the seventh floor			0
officials were summoned to your office , ' he said			0
' when i just wanted to have a quick chat with a particular official about a query it had to be a diarised meeting and that person was summoned			0
occasionally i played hooky and actually went to another floor			0
it was like a state visit			0
' i literally had to give my private office the slip in order to go and have a two - minute conversation with an official			2
' he said there was a culture within the department of giving ' as little information as possible ' when it came to answering @entity78 ' questions , with the responses vetted by special advisers before they were signed off by ministers			2
' the parliamentary question system is there for parliamentarians to ask for information to which they are entitled			0
i think we as ministers and we as a department have a duty to give it			0
that was not the culture in the @entity22 , ' he said .			0

former children 's minister @entity3 takes *aim* at his old boss
