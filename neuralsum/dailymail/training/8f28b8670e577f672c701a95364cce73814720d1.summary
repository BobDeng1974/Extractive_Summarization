a professional female fighter says she hopes she can be a role model for other women and inspire them to take up the combat sport			1
@entity3 , 28 , from @entity4 , @entity5 , is taking part in the first women - only season of @entity11 's @entity10 - a reality tv series where she will compete against other female fighters from around the world			1
@entity14 has been practising mixed martial arts ( @entity16 ) from a young age and is delighted to have the opportunity to take part in the show			1
the winner will walk away with a six figure contract with the @entity23 ( the world 's biggest @entity16 organisation ) and will become a world champion			1
she said : ' i do n't tell people straight away			2
i usually say i work in the gym and then i 'll see how the conversations goes			0
then i might go on to tell them i 'm a professional fighter			1
' they say i 'm too sweet or too quiet and innocent to be a fighter			1
' she added that she gets told ' all the time ' that she should n't be a fighter because she 's a woman			1
' people say " your face is too pretty to be getting hit "			2
i train hard every day so that i do n't get hit in the face ! ' she said			2
although some may be shocked at @entity14 's vocation because of her gender , she said there 's no such sexism within the fighting industry			1
she said : ' luckily , i 've been in an environment where i 've never been treated badly			0
my fans like me because i 'm a good fighter , not because i 'm a woman			1
occupational hazard : the brunette is often told ' your face is too pretty to be getting hit ' in action : @entity14 , left , had her first professional fight at the age of 18 ' the men in the gym just see me as another fighter , not as a girl			1
as long as you keep your head down and work hard , no one is ever going to judge you or treat you differently because you 're a woman			0
' @entity14 added that her friends and family are extremely supportive and watch all her fights			0
she said : ' my mum always does my hair before my fights if i 'm fighting locally			2
she always winds me up and says that i should be doing a beauty pageant , not a fight			0
but she 's been there since day one			1
she was the one who took me to my first class			0
' she knows how much i love it and how dedicated i am , and she just wants me to be happy			0
my brother and sister love it too			0
they will all watch it - even my sister who is a school teacher and does n't have a violent bone in her body			2
they support me and they know i love what i 'm doing			2
' the athlete said she feels extremely lucky that she has been able to turn a sport she loves into a career			2
she said : ' even if i was nâ€™t fighting professionally , i would be doing it as a hobby because i love it so much			0
loves the sport : @entity14 says mixed marital arts is a great workout for your body and mind ' i 'm not doing it for the money or for anything else ; i 'm doing it because i love it			1
everything else is just a bonus			0
i 'm so grateful that i 've managed to make a living out of the sport i love			1
it just shows you that , if you work hard and you put your mind to it , you can achieve what you want in life			0
' she first tried the combat sport @entity116 when she was 13 and went on to have her first professional fight she was 18 before focussing on @entity16			1
she 'd love it if more women would follow in her footsteps			2
' it would be good to see more women taking up @entity16			1
everyone i meet , i try to get them to try it			0
@entity16 is an outlet for things			0
it 's like going to the gym but it 's so much better because you 're not just going there , running on the treadmill and leaving , but you 're training your body in different ways , ' she enthuses			2
winning mentality : her goal is to become @entity23 strawweight champion ' you have to switch off from the world			1
if i 've heard bad news or i 've had a bad day , i 'll go to the gym and two hours later i 'll leave and feel so much better about things			2
i get lost in the moment			0
@entity16 lets you look at things in a different , more positive way			0
' she added : ' my goal for now is to be the @entity23 strawweight champion and all the stuff that comes along with that is just a bonus			0
during that journey i would like to think i could touch people			0
i 'd like to be a role model for young girls and boys			0
' aside from encouraging more people to take up the sport , she also hopes @entity163 will encourage more people to watch live fights			1
' for people who have never seen a @entity23 fight , you ca n't even describe the atmosphere , ' she said			0
the ultimate fighter : a champion will be crowned is on wednesday nights at 3am on @entity11 and repeated at 10pm on thursdays on @entity11			1
