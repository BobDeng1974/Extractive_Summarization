by @entity0 published : 12:42 est , 5 march 2013 updated : 13:23 est , 5 march 2013 these tragic photos show the body of a tusker elephant who died today when he was hit by a speeding train in @entity6			1
the adult elephant was struck by a train in a forest at the @entity10 , a few miles from @entity11 in north east @entity12			1
a speeding passenger train , the @entity15 - bound @entity14 , hit the elephant while he was crossing the railway line			1
heart - breaking sight : the dead body of the tusker elephant lies on railway track after it was struck by the speeding passenger train deadly collision : unlike the @entity28 species , only male @entity26 elephants have tusks , making it certain the elephant who died here was an adult male the tiger reserve where the elephant was killed is inside the @entity10 , which runs along @entity12 's boundary with @entity37			1
this means that the tiger reserve serves as international corridor for elephants migrating between @entity12 and @entity37 , making a it a danger spot for train drivers			2
@entity12 forest guards now have the difficult task of getting the huge animal off the tracks so that the train line can reopen			2
sadly this fatal collision was not an isolated incident			0
as recently as december last year , five elephants were killed after they were hit by a passenger train in the eastern @entity12 state of @entity55			1
they were crossing railway tracks with their herd			0
at the moment there are around 26,000 wild elephants in @entity12			2
although elephants are worshipped by many @entity12 , their shrinking habitat has made them increasingly unsafe , especially when travelling cross country			0
the state of @entity55 in eastern @entity12 last year issued a warning , asking trains to slow down because of moving elephants herd , but they say it was ignored			0
the main reasons for elephant deaths are poaching , eating crops poisoned by farmers , and being hit by trains			0
last week , @entity12 â€™s rail minister @entity77 stressed the need to protect the elephants from trains , describing the animals as ' gentle giants ' whose lives must be safeguarded			1
forlorn : the huge elephant is left on its back with the dent from the collision clearly visible on the front of the train			0

adult male was killed instantly by the passenger train in @entity6
@entity12 's rail minister has stressed need to look out for these ' gentle giants '
