president @entity0 is slapping back at a former longtime top adviser who writes in a new book that he lied for years about his position on gay marriage so he could get elected president in 2008			1
@entity7 ' is mixing up my personal feelings with my position on the issue , ' the president said tuesday , in a startling admission that his public stance on the divisive social issue was n't always in sync with what he actually believed			1
' i always felt that same - sex couples should be able to enjoy the same rights , legally , as anybody else , ' @entity0 told @entity21 , and so it was frustrating to me not to , i think , be able to square that with what were a whole bunch of religious sensitivities out there			1
' documents reveal wild swings in the @entity31 politician 's stated positions as his career developed in the 1990s and beyond			0
but on tuesday the president claimed his true feelings never wavered			0
' i favor legalizing same - sex marriages , and would fight efforts to prohibit such marriages , ' @entity0 wrote then			2
two years later , as his political future began to take shape , he told the same newspaper that he was ' undecided			1
' @entity0 said tuesday that ' the old questionnaire , you know , is an example of struggling with what was a real issue at the time , which is how do you make sure that people ’s rights are enjoyed and these religious sensitivities were taken into account ? ' ' you know , these are the kinds of things you learn as you ... move forward in public life : that sometimes you ca n’t split the difference			2
that sometimes you just have to be very clear that this is what ’s right			0
' it took the president more than a decade to take that advice			0
by 2008 , under the glare of a presidential campaign and the weight of history , his public rhetoric swung to a position that @entity97 's bible belt could embrace – support for only a traditional definition of marriage			1
but as president in 2010 he returned publicly to his original position 14 years after he first articulated it			1
@entity42 press secretary @entity104 did not respond to a request for comment on tuesday about the timeline that brought @entity0 to his eventual public awakening on the issue , which came after a series of court rulings made it less politically risky to support gay marriage rights			1
@entity7 writes in ' believer : my forty years in @entity116 ' that he told the future president in 2008 that he should hide the ball and deceive the @entity97 public for political purposes			1
' opposition to gay marriage was particularly strong in the black church , ' the former @entity0 insider writes , ' and as he ran for higher office , he grudgingly accepted the counsel of more pragmatic folks like me , and modified his position to support civil unions rather than marriage , which he would term a " sacred union "			1
' in 1996 when @entity0 ran for statewide office in @entity47 for the first time , he told a @entity31 newspaper called outlines that ' i favor legalizing same - sex marriages ' by 1998 @entity0 's transformation into a more cautious – and electable – politician had begun ; he told the same paper that he was ' undecided ' about marriage rights for gays and lesbians that duplicity reached its apex during a 2008 appearance at pastor @entity146 's @entity145 , a wellspring of @entity97 evangelical @entity149 thought			1
' i believe that marriage is the union between a man and a woman , ' he said then			0
' now , for me as a @entity149 – for me – for me as a @entity149 , it is also a sacred union			0
@entity156 's in the mix. ' and just two days before he would be elected president , he told an interview on @entity160 that ' i believe marriage is between a man and a woman			2
i am not in favor of gay marriage			1
' six months into his first term as president , @entity0 would ask @entity168 to repeal the @entity169 , an anti-gay - unions law			1
the following year he told a group of liberal bloggers that he was having a change of heart			0
' attitudes evolve , including mine , ' @entity0 said then			0
on tuesday he repositioned his personal slipstream of policy shifts as a much narrower matter of semantics driven by hurt feelings			0
' where my evolution took place , ' @entity0 said in his @entity21 interview , ' was not in my attitude toward same - sex couples			2
it was in understanding the pain and the sense of stigma that was being placed on same - sex couples who are friends of mine , where they ’d say , " you know what , if you ’re not calling it marriage , it does n’t feel like the same thing			0
even if you gave me the same rights , the fact that i ’m being treated differently or the love that we feel is somehow segmented off , that hurts "			0
' ' it was because of those conversations that i ended up shifting positions , ' he explained – ' that civil unions , in fact , were not sufficient rather than marriage			0
' ' but i think the notion that somehow i was always in favor of marriage per se is n’t quite accurate			0
' if he was having a change of heart , @entity7 writes , it was in the process of returning to his true feelings			2
' if @entity0 's views were " evolving " publicly , they were fully evolved behind closed doors , ' he relates in his book			1
' the president was champing at the bit to announce his support for the right of gay and lesbian couples to wed – and having watched him struggle with this issue for years , i was ready , too			1
' hide the ball : two days before his first presidential election , he told an @entity160 audience that ' i believe marriage is between a man and a woman			2
i am not in favor of gay marriage			1
' @entity240 got the first sneak peek at the section of the book , released tuesday , that deals with @entity0 's on - again , off - again relationship with the gay marriage issue			1
@entity7 's recollections pair a picture of @entity0 as a tortured soul , unable to square his self - image as a tgruth teller with the reality of his political lie			1
' having prided himself on forthrightness , though , @entity0 never felt comfortable with his compromise and , no doubt , compromised position , ' he writes			2
' he routinely stumbled over the question when it came up in debates or interviews			0
' @entity7 writes that he recalls @entity0 telling him : ' i 'm just not very good at bulls * * * * ing ' – a claim that @entity266 would dispute			1
ultimately it was vice president @entity268 who flushed his boss out , saying on the @entity272 ' talk show that he was ' absolutely comfortable ' with the idea of gay marriage			1
with that , @entity0 had to come forward			0
' every single @entity97 – gay , straight , lesbian , bisexual , transgender – every single @entity97 deserves to be treated equally in the eyes of the law and in the eyes of our society , ' he said at an annual dinner of the @entity285 , @entity97 's leading gay - rights group			2
@entity287 : @entity0 publicly said in 2012 what he had believed for years – that he backed marriage rights for homosexuals and on may 9 , 2012 in an interview with @entity292 , he said : ' i 've just concluded that for me personally , it is important for me to go ahead and affirm that i think same - sex couples should be able to get married			1
' last month during an interview with a @entity299 celebrity , the president said he hopes the @entity97 @entity300 will issue a ruling this year that would prevent states from banning gay marriage			1
' i 'm hopeful the @entity300 comes to the right decision , ' he said			0
@entity7 's recollections might be taken with a grain of salt , since the first published excerpt from his book focused on a story that was later labeled ' ridiculous ' and a ' lie			2
' @entity311 ? @entity7 's book has already stirred controversy with a story about @entity315 that the former @entity266 nominee 's closest personal aide says is a ' lie ' he claimed that during a post-election concession phone call in 2012 , @entity266 presidential nominee @entity315 hinted to @entity0 that he won primarily on the strength of black voter turnout in inner cities			1
' you really did a great job of getting the vote out in places like @entity326 and @entity327 , ' @entity315 told the president , according to @entity7 's version of events			2
but @entity315 's personal aide @entity332 said he was in the room , listening to @entity315 's end of the conversation , and nothing like that conversation ever occurred			0
the revelation appeared timed to affect the public standing of @entity315 if he had decided to run for president again in 2016			0
ultimately , the former @entity342 governor opted to stay on the sidelines			0
' i just hope this lie is the work of @entity7 and not the president , ' @entity332 told @entity348			2
i was very disappointed they would make that up			0
' @entity0 's sit - down with @entity21 is the latest in a series of occasions where the @entity42 has given liberals in nontraditional media outlets rare access to the leader of the free world			2
last month three @entity299 celebrities interviewed @entity0 , including one comedienne best known for eating @entity362 while sitting in a bathtub filled with milk and the cereal			0
the folllowing day the president spoke with @entity367 , a newish left - wing website known for ' @entity370 ' news concepts – and attracting digital slaps from people eager to correct its mistakes			0
@entity21 's interview also covered topics related to @entity377 , the 2016 elections , the death of @entity382 hostage @entity380 , and companies ' reactions to restrictions placed on them by the @entity386 .			0

president told a newspaper in 1996 when he first ran for office that he supported gay marriage ; two years later his answer changed to ' undecided '
by 2008 , as a presidential candidate , he was firmly in the ' traditional marriage ' camp
but @entity0 returned to his 1996 leanings in 2010 , telling the country that his position had ' evolved '
former @entity0 advisor @entity7 claims in a book @entity0 *lamented* to him that ' i 'm just not very good at bulls * * * * ing ' – but another of his stories from the same book has already been labeled as *fiction*
the president slapped back at @entity7 on tuesday , betraying in the process the realities of how he squared his then - *unpopular* beliefs with political realities
