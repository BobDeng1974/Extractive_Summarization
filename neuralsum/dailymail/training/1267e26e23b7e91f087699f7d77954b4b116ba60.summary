' i hit a pothole when i was doing about 35 or 40mph - which is well under the recommended speed limit there			1

i did n't know what to do so i ended up on the other side of the road			2
the apprentice hairdresser is calling on her local council to fill in the potholes to stop other drivers from suffering the same fate ' then i went through a fence and into a tree			1
i would have gone further but i went into a hedge which stopped me			2
' at some point during all of this my air bags deployed , i 'm not sure when though			0
' i was really scared			0
i looked for my phone to call 999 but i could n't find it and i started to panic			0
' then some men came running up to me and helped get me out my car and called 999			0
' i was taken to hospital where they had to give me some really strong pain killers			0
' they also had to give me some aesthetic so they could pull all the glass out my face			0
' miss @entity8 has now launched an appeal for all of the potholes in the area to be filled in to prevent the same thing happening to other drivers			1
she said : ' the only thing that was there to warn about them was white paint around the outside , but the paint had been there so long it was starting to fade			0
' there should have been something there to warn drivers			0
miss @entity8 , who has since recovered from her injuries , recalled the accident			1

i looked for my phone to call 999 but i could n't find it and i started to panic ' the teenager , who was forced to spend £ 500 on a new car , called for @entity96 to repair the potholes			1
a spokesman for the council said the holes have been filled as part of routine inspections made across the county 's road network ' when it 's such a dangerous and busy road there needs to be some kind of warning			1
' at night it 's impossible to see them , there needs to be a sign or something			2
' after my accident my sister saw another @entity11 lose control after hitting a pothole on a different road			1
' it 's going to keep happening until the council do something			1

' the teenager braved the roads for the first time today , getting back behind the wheel of her car , adding the incident could have been a ' lot worse '			0
a spokesman for @entity96 said : ' our sympathies are with the driver involved in this accident			1
' we inspect our busiest roads every month as a matter of course , fixing the worst potholes immediately and repairing others within 28 days – in line with national guidelines			2
' potholes on this stretch of road have now been fixed as part of these routine repairs and we will continue to monitor the road closely			1
' when @entity151 damaged his car driving over a pothole , he decided that the council should foot the repair bill			2
but rather than admit fault , officials said they knew nothing of the hole and said his poor driving must have been to blame			0
they dismissed the 62 - year - old grandfather ’s claim that they should pay the £ 500 bill to fix the wrecked suspension on his @entity166			1
pothole : @entity151 , 62 , stands over the pothole in @entity169 , which damaged the suspension on his car but mr @entity151 suspected he was being fobbed off and resolved to find out whether the council was telling him the truth			2
using a @entity173 request , he found out that a council worker had reported the 18in by 6in hole during an inspection three months earlier – but the council had ignored it			2
the hole was even recorded as a priority case that should be repaired within 28 days , but it was never fixed			2
he thought that this evidence should be enough to force the council to soften its stance			0
but even after mr @entity151 , a retired @entity186 project manager , told @entity187 of his findings , it still refused to pay up – and the disagreement went to the small claims court			0
at a hearing at @entity193 , a judge ruled in favour of mr @entity151 and ordered the council to refund him £ 500 , plus costs of £ 115			0
‘ i think the council works on the basis that a lot of drivers will just throw their hands up in despair at all the obstacles which are put in their way and just forget about it as people just do n’t want the hassle , ’ he said			0
‘ i have had phone calls and texts saying “ well done ” since i won the court case and hopefully more people will now do the same			0
