much of the talk surrounding @entity1 this summer has been focused on who will replace @entity3			0
what @entity4 quickly realised is that there was probably no one that could			0
and therefore against @entity9 at @entity10 he had to adapt - changing last season 's hugely successful system to make up for the loss of his £ 75million striker			1
@entity16 , cut loose from his familiar partner , worked as a lone striker			1
@entity19 went wide on the left while @entity21 took his place on the right with a license to move inside			2
@entity25 had to settle for a spot on the bench			0
only this time round , that forward was n't @entity3			0
@entity19 moved inside from his left wing position and latched on to @entity45 's excellent ball from inside his own half to tuck the ball beyond @entity47 - putting @entity1 ahead after 23 minutes			1
but while last season @entity1 were free - flowing and constantly dangerous - against the @entity9 there were teething problems , although they did eventually start the @entity63 era with a win			2
and it had all started so well - @entity4 ' tactical switch paid dividends midway through the first half when @entity19 scored the opener			2
the pacey 19 - year - old was hanging around on the left while @entity72 and @entity45 fought for the ball in midfield			2
with @entity16 and @entity21 otherwise occupied , @entity45 looked up to see @entity19 as the best option			1
the additional width provided by his new role put @entity19 in the perfect positon to sprint away from @entity79 and giving him the chance to finish coolly past @entity47			0
it was the sort of move so frequently seen last season when @entity3 was cutting defences into ribbons - and would have had @entity1 fans believing that there is life after @entity3			0
but unfortunately that moment was out of the ordinary rather than the norm			0
while there were concerns about nullifying @entity19 's threat out wide for @entity95 this summer - @entity1 ended up having exactly the same problem with @entity21			1
finish : @entity19 puts the ball in the back of the net during the first half to give the @entity101 the lead delight : @entity4 ' new system looked to be paying dividends as @entity19 put @entity1 ahead after 23 minutes tactical issue : @entity21 found it difficult to create from out wide and his inroads into midfield were n't great the @entity111 playmaker has been in great form for the @entity101 in pre season but he simply could n't get ahold of the game - finding it difficult to create from the wide role and finding himself a little lost when he tried to make inroads into the centre of the park			1
that left @entity16 starved of service with @entity19 - who was excellent in the first half - only providing fleeting glimpses of his talent in the second half as @entity9 grew into the game			1
@entity128 for once looked a little lost , leaving @entity45 as the prime creator - a role that he performed admirably but that proved too much to shoulder alone			2
tightly marked : @entity19 finds it difficult to escape from the excellent @entity133 at @entity10 what now ? @entity21 and @entity16 prepare to restart the game after @entity79 's equaliser got that one wrong : @entity21 heads off after failing to spark @entity1 into life at @entity10 @entity4 rung the changes , with @entity139 coming in for @entity140 and @entity25 making his debut in place of @entity21			1
@entity139 made things a bit more direct and his impact helped create the winner			0
@entity16 slipped in the winner after the ball had bounced around the @entity9 area with four @entity1 players in the box as they mixed it up			1
it was relief rather than justification for @entity4 ' tactical switch but for now it does n't matter			0
@entity1 are off and running with three points - but the conundrum of how to replace @entity3 continues and they will need to do more against @entity158 in their second @entity160 game			0
decider : @entity16 watches as his side footed finish drops into the bottom corner of @entity47 's net relieved : @entity16 celebrates the winner that he provided with a deft touch from @entity19 's headed pass			1

last season 's player of the year *joined* @entity172 in £ 75million deal
@entity4 has spent big to replace the @entity176 's big influence
*manager* went with experience in the forward positions vs @entity9
@entity19 started wide on the left with @entity21 in no 10 role
@entity16 was *deployed* as a lone striker - a change from last season
@entity19 gave @entity1 the lead after 23 minutes latching on to @entity45 's smart through ball that cut through @entity9
@entity21 looked lost out on the right as @entity1 *struggled* to create
@entity16 scored the winner latching on to @entity19 's header in the box
@entity1 had success after bringing on @entity25 and going direct
