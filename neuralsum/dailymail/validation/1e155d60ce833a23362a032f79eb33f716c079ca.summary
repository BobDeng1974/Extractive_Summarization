being a member of a boy band is always a risky business but being a member of a tribute boy band is even more uncertain , as the ' @entity5 ' of the @entity8 's most popular @entity7 tribute band found out last week			1
@entity9 , 25 , from @entity10 , has been part of only one direction for the last three years and was preparing to go on tour with the group when the news broke last wednesday			1
but despite @entity5 's departure from the group , @entity9 has decided to carry on with the band in the traditional five - person line - up			1
nothing lasts forever but the last three years have been unforgettable for us all			0
' there ’s been tears of joy , tears of pain , hatred , love but when it ’s over , we will all leave with a set of friends and i for one , cherish them …			0
but do n’t let them know that ' but only one direction will be gigging as normal as a five piece with @entity5 in it - as long as people want to see us , i think we would be silly not to carry on			1
' it ’s great to be able to do what you love for a living			0
' @entity9 ( left ) has been playing the part of @entity5 ( right ) in a tribute band for three years @entity58 as @entity5 in 2013 @entity9 joined only one direction in 2012 after being contacted by an old friend who had signed on to play the part of @entity26			1
he said : ' i knew @entity25 , who plays @entity26 - we were in the @entity63 together			2
' he called me and said , " hey , i ’ve got a really fun opportunity			0
it ’s for a @entity7 tribute , " three years later , i ’m still here			2
' since then the group have toured the @entity8 , @entity68 and the @entity69			1
@entity9 said : ' it ’s been a rollercoaster for us			1
' i entered this group thinking that it would be a little pocket money but it quickly became a full time job			0
' i was always sheepish about saying , i ’m in a @entity7 tribute but truthfully , i ’m very proud of the shows we put on			0
' @entity5 with the rest of @entity7 in 2012 and while they may not be the real deal , it does n't stopped teenage fans going crazy at shows and meet and greets			1
@entity9 said : ' it can get a little crazy			1
in @entity89 , we had to have security and had to be moved to avoid crushing crowds			0
' people remark on a passing resemblance [ between @entity5 and @entity94 ]			2
but the truth is we ’re not trying to be lookalike band			0
that would be a little token tribute			0
' no disrespect to the other tributes out there but we ’re a theatre show , we like to bill ourselves as an experience			0
' @entity58 as @entity5 from one direction for the meantime , @entity9 is going to continue performing as @entity5 , but even if all the members of the real one direction decide to throw in the towel , he has his own music to fall back on			1
on tuesday he releases his debut solo single @entity109 on @entity110			0
@entity9 said : ' i 'm inspired by perseverance and learning from those around me			2
' there ’s such talent coming out of the @entity8 music scene and i ’m keen to be a part of it			2
