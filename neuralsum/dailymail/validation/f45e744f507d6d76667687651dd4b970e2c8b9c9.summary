it 's a common practice for people to leave honest appraisals of a hotel after their stay , and they are often scathing and highly critical			1
however , after one too many rude guests , a hotel group has decided to start reviewing their guests and publishing their scorecard online			1
@entity10 will trial a new program , ' @entity11 ' at their six hotels in @entity13 and @entity14			1
it gives the hotel staff the opportunity to rate guests ' behaviour and post their scorecard online			1
' stay and request to be reviewed at any of our hotels from april 17 until may 31			1

but be warned , if you misbehave , everyone will know ! ' @entity10 marketing director @entity42 said the program has been inspired by online review website ' @entity45 ' and is intended as a fun activity for guests and staff alike			2
' @entity49 flips the process on its head and provides a way for us to recognise and reward good behaviour in a fun and light - hearted way			2
' ' these days everyone 's a critic			0
the internet has enabled people to rate every film , restaurant or latte they experience , good or bad , ' the hotels ' website explains			0

' ' we have many guests who fail to meet our standards but we did n't have a forum of our own - until now , ' the company says , explaining that guests are known to steal from or trash hotel rooms the @entity10 are curious to see if the fear of dirty laundry being aired in public affects their guests ' behaviour			1
it comes after a study by @entity84 unveiled the truth about awful behaviour in @entity88 hotels and the filthy acts that go on behind closed doors			1
the number of people game enough to admit that they are guilty of trashing rooms , parading naked in front of windows and stealing proves that even grown adults run amuck when they 're away from home			2

also , the study found that wealthier people are more likely to misbehave and ' the poorer you are the less likely you are to take an item without paying '			0
