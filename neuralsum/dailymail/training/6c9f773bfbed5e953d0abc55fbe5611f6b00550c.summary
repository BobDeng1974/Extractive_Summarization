a letter written in @entity1 by @entity2 in 1925 has sold for almost £ 50,000 at auction a letter by @entity2 that is unusually written in @entity1 has fetched £ 49,000 at auction			1
the @entity7 genius ’s 1925 missive to @entity1 electrical engineer @entity8 defends his 1915 theory of relativity in the face of strong criticism			1
it also speaks of ‘ @entity14 ’ as a scientific concept despite @entity2 not believing in a deity			2
the letter was penned after the scientist faced the criticism of @entity21 physicist @entity20 who sought to disprove his theory in a series of experiments			1
dismissing his findings , @entity2 wrote to @entity8 : ' i agree with your opinion on the fact that the movement of an ether with a [ mathematical formula ] so high is particularly impossible			1
' @entity14 created the world with more intelligence and elegance			0
you ’re right to compare with @entity20 ’s works , the laws of aberration			0
' the theory of @entity41 is very artificial and can not - in my opinion - explain this law of aberration			0
' i would be very curious to know the real cause of the @entity20 ’s phenomenon			0
. i do not doubt the validity of the theory of relativity			0
' although @entity2 was fluent in @entity1 having lived in @entity1 with his family in the mid 1890s letters written by him in the language are scarce			1
a spokesman for @entity56 in @entity57 , @entity58 , where the sale was held , said : ' this magnificent letter is rife with intriguing content - each and every sentence contains a revelatory turn and could be expounded upon at length within the context of @entity2 ’s life and work			1
' that it is written in @entity1 is notable in itself			1
his family had moved to @entity1 for a few years in the mid- 1890s and , although he was fluent , letters in @entity1 are seldom seen			2
' while in @entity1 at just 16 years old , @entity2 published what is generally considered his first scientific paper , entitled ‘ on the @entity74 in a @entity75			1
’ ' this presents a nice connection to the letter , which refutes some of the concepts surrounding that very topic			0
the @entity7 scientist was fluent in @entity1 after living in @entity1 with his family for some time as a teenager ' especially interesting is the strong stance he takes in defence of the theory of relativity at the conclusion			1
' @entity2 had dedicated much of the previous decade to refining the study of relativity after introducing his ‘ @entity91 ’ in 1915			0
. ' as @entity2 ’s revolutionary theory grew in acceptance within the scientific community through the 1920s , a small but vocal minority emerged in opposition			2
@entity2 , who famously did not believe in @entity14 , makes reference to the deity in the rare letter ' @entity20 , an advocate of ether theory and absolute space , was one such opponent and offered @entity2 experimental evidence to support his ideas			1
' while @entity2 acknowledged that a positive result for the existence of ether would invalidate the theory of special relativity , he asserted that @entity20 ’s results were erroneous and tainted by environmental factors			2
' the discussion of @entity14 as a creator is also fascinating			0
although he did not believe in a personal deity , @entity2 was not averse to speaking of @entity14 in a scientific context when discussing differing interpretations of quantum physics			0
' in 1929 , he said that he believed " in @entity118 ’s @entity14 , who reveals himself in the harmony of all that exists , " and in the 1950s he wrote " if something is in me which can be called religious then it is the unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our science can reveal it			0
" ' it is this conception of @entity14 that appears in the present letter , with the idea of a world designed with " intelligence and elegance " corresponding with these later notions of structural harmony			0
' it was these harmonious structures - the things at the very core of creation - that @entity2 hoped to uncover and describe in his quest for knowledge as a physicist , forming a bridge between the scientific and the spiritual			2
' all together , this is a truly exceptional letter that encompasses a varied range of @entity2 ’s thoughts during this period			2

the letter was written in 1925 and addressed to engineer @entity8
in it , @entity2 dismisses views of @entity21 critic opposed to his theory
it is one of the rare *examples* of the scientist *'s* knowledge of @entity1
the letter was sold for £ 49,000 to a *private* buyer at an auction in @entity57
