by @entity0 @entity1 is to modernise its army by introducing flexible working hours that allow soldiers to take time off during school holidays and offering on - barracks daycare services for their children			1
defence minister @entity9 said army bases will be fitted out with flat - screen tvs and minibars as part of of a € 100million drive to make the armed forces more attractive to new recruits the measures have been roundly attacked by army commanders , who described them as policies for ' sissies and wimps ' , with ms @entity9 - @entity1 's first female defence minister - criticised for being out of touch with the real needs of the army			1
new era : soldiers in the @entity1 army ( pictured ) will now be treated to extended leave during the school holidays and widescreen televisions in barracks as part of plans to ' modernise ' the armed forces general @entity38 , a retired former chief of staff of @entity1 ’s armed forces , told @entity41 magazine that ms @entity9 had no idea of the military , adding that her proposals were the ideas of a ' good housewife taking care of her children '			1
in a separate interview he said the @entity1 army 's outdated equipment was of far greater concern than the childcare and entertainment needs of soldiers , the @entity49 reported			2
@entity1 's defence spending remains far behind that of other countries in @entity59			0
the country spends only 1.3 per cent of its gdp on its military , despite having signed a @entity65 agreement saying each member state 's defence spending must be at least 2 per cent			0

anger : @entity1 's first female defence minister @entity9 ( pictured ) has been criticised for being out of touch with the real needs of the army			1
one commander said her policies were for ' sissies and wimps ' ms @entity9 's € 100million recruitment drive has therefore caused anger among those who have long demanded more money be made available to modernise weapons and defence systems			1
another concern is that the international image of the @entity1 army is at all time low , with its depleted workforce already seen as overly soft - particularly on recent peacekeeping missions in @entity101			0
ms @entity9 has defended her recruitment project however , saying the army had to modernise its childcare policies in order to compete with top businesses and attract the best staff			2
despite concerns over the strength of the @entity1 army , the country remains the world 's third biggest arms exporter - behind only the @entity72 and @entity77			0
foreign sales of weaponry bring almost € 1billion into the @entity1 economy every year .			0
