by @entity0 cabinet office minister @entity1 wants older people to use the internet to access government services older people must start using the internet or run the risk of losing access to government services , a senior @entity5 said yesterday			1
the vast majority of public services will only be available online in the future , said cabinet office minister @entity1			1
he said millions of pounds can be saved by copying airlines , which only provide services face - to - face if there is no way to move them online			2
the minister called on older people to get ‘ digitally engaged ’ – because getting to grips with the internet is a ‘ better thing for people ’s lives ’			2
but pensioners ’ groups last night reacted with fury , saying that elderly people who refused to ‘ conform ’ to the state ’s demands would be treated as ‘ second - class citizens ’			1
those who had paid taxes all their lives should be able to access government services in whichever way they feel most comfortable – and not left to ‘ drown ’ , they said			1
at a @entity40 conference , mr @entity1 said one - off help will be given for the ‘ digitally - excluded ’ – chiefly pensioners			1
he said : ‘ our point is that everything that can be delivered online should be delivered online and only online			1
’ more than five million pensioners have never been online , estimates show			2
ministers are moving dozens of public services on to the internet , including the carers ’ allowance , used by the 3.2million carers a year			0
driving licences , the small claims service and ‘ lasting powers of attorney ’ – which allow families to take control of a loved one ’s financial affairs – are also going online			2
mr @entity1 , addressing civil servants about government efficiency measures , said such moves would cut the cost of manning phonelines or face - to - face services			1
help for those who did not know how to use the internet would be given through a ‘ assisted digital ’ service , provided by charities such as the @entity72			0
but the focus would be on showing them how to go online – not on helping them to access services if they do not wish to use the internet			1
mr @entity1 also indicated that help would not be offered ‘ repeatedly ’			2
‘ they ’re doing it in a way that will help to get those people online , because actually people will have in future richer lives if they become digitally engaged , ’ he said			0
pensioner @entity86 was taught to use the internet on her @entity88 by a friend at her home in @entity91 , @entity92 as part of a project funded by the @entity95			0
but many elderly people have no access to the internet pensioners ’ groups yesterday expressed concern that services important to the elderly , such as pensions , benefits and council tax , will be moved online only			1
@entity108 , of the @entity107 , said ministers were creating an ‘ information gap ’			0
‘ the idea that we all have to be digital citizens or else we end up as second - class citizens is wrong , ’ she said			0
@entity115 , from @entity116 , added : ‘ the digital tide is certainly turning , but the government needs to ensure we can all ride the technology wave and not leave some left to drown unaided because they do n’t choose to “ conform ”			0
’ @entity121 , of @entity122 , added : ‘ no - one should be locked out of any services simply because they do n’t use the internet			0
’ people should be able to vote from the comfort of their armchairs , commons speaker @entity127 said last night			0
allowing the electorate to go online rather than to polling booths is hardly ‘ earth - shattering ’ , he told the @entity134 think - tank .			0
