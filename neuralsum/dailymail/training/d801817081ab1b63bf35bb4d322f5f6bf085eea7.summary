by @entity0 for @entity1 the human face has been officially classed as an organ , paving the way for a future where @entity6 give permission to allow theirs to be donated to a complete stranger			1
the agencies which regulate @entity6 's transplant system , @entity9 and @entity11 and the @entity12 , announced the changes in july , bureaucratically streamlining the previously difficult application process			1
inarguably the most visible and personal of organs now on the transplant list , the news that facial transplants have become nationalized will invariably raise concerns about the limits of state control over the most emotive body - part of all of its citizens			1
scroll down for @entity24 incredible : here is @entity28 native @entity27 before ( left ) and seven months after surgeons performed the most extreme face transplant ever			1
the 37 - year - old 's face was destroyed after being shot in 1997 model star : @entity33 , 39 , appears in @entity34 this month , talking about the life - changing face transplant he received in 2012 and how it has become a landmark study around the world on july 3 , less than a decade after the first facial transplant was conducted in @entity41 , an @entity6 's face is now classified as an ' organ ' for the purposes of transplantation			1
however , unlike the liver , heart , lungs or kidneys , which for all intents and purposes are invisible , the face is not considered under the new law to be an organ until it is harvested			2
the face is now technically referred to as a @entity58 organ , or a vascularized composite allografts ' , which means three years on from the nation 's first transplant , a whole raft of legal guidelines now exist for state transfer of one deceased citizens face to another living person according to medical blog @entity65			1
also joining the list are hands , which also previously fell under the control of the @entity70 and were only transplanted in experimental surgeries , like faces			1
the reason why faces and hands have been classified slightly differently to other body parts is to reflect the sensitivities of the public , uneasy that faces and other personal organs like hands , can be transplanted			1
with only 21 face transplants ever conducted worldwide , the @entity70 had classed the surgery experimental			1
now , reflecting the growing abilities of medical bio-science , the change in status of the face allows doctors transplanting it access to the global and national network of associations dedicated to transporting the body part efficiently			2
watch video here staggering : face transplant recipient @entity95 is seen before her injury , and before and after her surgery ( @entity98 ) , in this combination picture made from photographs released on august 11 , 2011 ' there ’s this whole machinery that ’s highly efficient and very well trained to do organ transplants , but as it stood with a face transplant ... it was like a mom and pop operation , ' says @entity107 , a transplant surgeon at @entity108 and chair of the committee with the @entity12 to the @entity111			1
however , @entity107 is keen to allay fears from the public about their faces now being potential state property			0
@entity33 , 38 , blew his face - off with a shotgun blast in front of his mother in 1997 , while drunk			1
the blast took off half of his face and @entity27 was left contemplating suicide during his recovery			0
in 2012 , the @entity125 in @entity126 performed the ground - breaking surgery			1
incredibly , in 2014 , @entity27 and his new face found themselves on the cover of august 's @entity34 , reflecting his incredible recovery			2
@entity95 was viciously attacked by her friend 's chimpanzee , @entity134 , in 2009			0
in 2011 , @entity135 in @entity136 performed the surgery to repair the damage			2
@entity139 , who was left permanently blind , and lost her nose , eyes and lips in the attack , received a ground - breaking face transplant in may , 2011			2
a team of more than 30 surgeons , nurses and anaesthetists at @entity135 in @entity136 , led by dr @entity150 , painstakingly rebuilt her face			0
they took the donor 's skin , underlying muscle , nerves and upper palate and transplanted the whole face on to ms @entity95 's skull			2
@entity161 became the first @entity6 to have a full face transplant in march , 20011 at @entity135 and women 's in @entity136			1
the surgery was paid for by the @entity165 , which gave the hospital a $ 3.4million research grant for five transplants			0
mr @entity161 was the third person in the @entity6 to receive a face transplant - after @entity170 , at the same hospital in 2009 and @entity172 at the @entity173 in 2008			1
a team of more than 30 doctors , nurses and anaesthesiologists work for 15 hours to replace his face			0
he suffered life threatening burns after losing control of a lift platform he had been on to repair a church window two - and - a - half years ago			0
after toppling over his head had slammed into a live power cable that seared off his face			0
' we do n’t think the general public is at a point now where we can rip off somebody ’s face just because they signed a state registry ...			0
the policy is you have to have separate , explicit consent from the family for hands and face , ' she said to the @entity111			2
indeed , @entity107 acknowledges the wildly different psychological process involved with a facial transplant			0
' the thought of transplanting such a highly visible personal part of somebody is a very different concept than thinking of putting someone ’s kidney in you , ' said @entity107 to the @entity111			0
for most , the idea that their loved ones heart can save anothers life is presently more acceptable than their face being appropriated			0
recovery : @entity161 settles into life in @entity217 , @entity218 , after undergoing face transplant			0
here , he is at home with his dog @entity221 , june 20 , 2011 experts responding to the news note that from birth we are hard - wired to respond and react to people 's faces in a symbolic manner			1
however , the new classification will allow for far easier transplants of those injured in @entity233 and @entity234 , and even open up the field for more organs			1
' there have been transplants of the larynx , of a whole vascularized knee joint , ' said @entity107 to the @entity111			0
' there ’s been some very few uterus transplants , even some thoughts of penile transplants ...			0
it ’s a very wide open field			0
' first : @entity246 who received the world 's first partial face transplant in 2005 , addresses a news conference at @entity251 hospital in @entity251 , @entity41 on february , 2006 and ( right ) in november of 2006			2

@entity253 changed the *definition* of the face in july
takes over *responsibility* for @entity6 citizen 's faces from @entity70
experimental surgery has only been performed 21 times worldwide
hands now officially classed as organs too - after *successful* surgeries
it is hoped that process will now become easier - easing the suffering of injured *war* vets
