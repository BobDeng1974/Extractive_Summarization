@entity0 , 29 , eventually had a perfect smile for her wedding day - after five months of corrective treatment for a set of botched veneers a young woman was devastated to be left with shattered black teeth just months before her wedding due to a botched set of veneers			1
@entity0 , 28 , had worn veneers since she was 15 after being bullied throughout her childhood for having discoloured teeth			1
she hoped a new set before her wedding would boost her self - confidence and was initially delighted with her new white smile			2
but she was horrified when her two of her teeth shattered when she bit into a bagel - and closer inspection revealed all the other veneers had turned grey			1
she discovered her gums and teeth had been badly damaged due to the botched veneers , fitted by a dentist she had known since she was a child			1
a veneer is a thin layer of porcelain made to fit over the front surface of a tooth , like a false fingernail fits over a nail			0
to make matters worse , she was then left with a £ 7,000 bill to fix her smile – along with five months ' worth of corrective treatment			1
miss @entity0 had not realised that her dentist , whom she had been visiting for years , had no extra qualifications or training for fitting veneers			1
after finding a dentist who specialised in veneers , her teeth were saved and she had a perfect smile for her wedding			1
she is now sharing her story in the hope that others will do their research before having veneers fitted			2
miss @entity0 , from @entity50 , said : ' it was only after my veneer completely shattered when i was eating a bagel that i discovered the full extent of the problem			1
' it was disgusting , i could see my tooth was black			0
it was something i was so conscious of because of the bullying i 'd suffered at school			0
' playground bullies picked on me for having large front teeth that were discoloured due to mineral imbalances			0
' i was so upset that my mum decided i needed veneers			2
' after being fitted with her first set at 15 , she had no problems until they were replaced in 2010 at a cost of around £ 2,000			1
miss @entity0 added : ' after my tooth shattered and the other veneer cracked , i lost faith in my old dentist so i went online to do some research to try and understand what sort of qualifications people should have to fit them			1
' i discovered there were courses for dentists to make sure they have all the information they need to fit veneers properly , and that my original dentist did n't have those			1
miss @entity0 had six veneers fitted by her local , trusted dentist in july 2010			1
initially she was happy with the result , but they later shattered as she was biting into a bagel			1
it emerged her teeth had cracked , turned black and grey and her gums had been damaged ' i found one who did and when he saw my teeth he was horrified			1
' he said it was the worst case of its kind he had seen in his 25 - year career			0
' the new dentist told me the veneers had not been fitted correctly and there was a gap between my gums and the veneers			1
' this meant bacteria was getting in and eating away at the bond which holds everything together			0
' a veneer is a thin layer of porcelain made to fit over the front surface of a tooth , like a false fingernail fits over a nail			0
veneers can improve the colour , shape and position of teeth			2
a precise shade of porcelain can be chosen to give the right colour to improve a single discoloured tooth or to lighten the front teeth			0
a veneer can make a chipped tooth look intact again			0
the porcelain covers the whole of the front of the tooth with a thicker section replacing the broken part			0
veneers can also be used to close small gaps , when braces are not suitable			2
if one tooth is slightly out of position , a veneer can sometimes be fitted to bring it into line with the others			0
veneers should last for many years ; but they can chip or break , just as teeth can			2
small chips can be repaired , or a new veneer fitted if necessary			2
porcelain veneers should last between five and twenty years , while composite veneers last a year or two at most			2
the costs for this treatment can vary from practice to practice so it is important to discuss charges and treatment options with the dentist before starting treatment			0
all six of miss @entity0 ' veneers needed replacing and she also had to undergo painful treatment on her gums , as well as ongoing treatment to tackle the gum disease she was left with			1
the treatment cost £ 7,366.20 and had to be carried out over a five - month period , but was thankfully complete before her wedding to fiancé @entity170 , 35 , in september 2014			1
miss @entity0 said : ' i was planning my wedding and all i could think about was how grey my teeth would look in the photographs , or the possibility of having a veneer falling out			1
' she took legal action against her old dentist who had fitted her six veneers so poorly			2
she was eventually paid £ 10,000 in compensation , covering the cost of her new set , and also helping to compensate for her pain and suffering			1
now , with her teeth fully repaired and her gums healed , she has a nice set of wedding pictures in which include plenty of smiles			1
but miss @entity0 says she will never forget her ordeal and is calling for much tighter regulation of dentists			2
' i do n't think dentists should be allowed to perform cosmetic dental procedures without having gone through additional training , ' she said			0
' my first dentist had lots of certificates in his waiting room and i always felt as though i could trust him as he was a professional			0
' i did n't know there was anything drastically wrong and because i trusted him i never questioned it			0
' he had been my dentist since i was a little girl and i had known him all my life			0
' thankfully my new dentist cleaned my teeth and managed to save them before fitting my new veneers			2
they are great now and everything has healed			0
' @entity212 , litigation assistant at @entity213 , represented miss @entity0 in her compensation claim			1
miss @entity0 found a new dentist who was able to restore her teeth in time for her wedding to @entity170 , 35 , in september 2014			1
she is now calling for cosmetic dentists to be regulated she believes the case is a good example of the need for greater regulation of industries such as cosmetic surgery and dentistry			0
she said : ' all too often we represent clients who have suffered as a result of dental or cosmetic surgery negligence and , as in this case , patients can suffer both financially and emotionally			0
' having veneers fitted is a very costly procedure and we were very pleased to have secured a positive outcome for @entity0			1
' however , we hope her case sends out a clear message to others that cosmetic dentistry , and any form of cosmetic surgery , is not something people should rush into			0
' before seeking treatment , check the dentist is registered with the @entity245 in the @entity246 , the @entity245 has lists of all registered dentists			0
before you seek treatment , check the dentist is registered			0
some dentists with special training or experience will also be on the @entity255 and can call themselves a ‘ specialist ’			0
these include areas such as orthodontists - who prevent or correct irregularities in the teeth , bite and jaw and prosthodontics - who are qualified to replace missing teeth by crowns , bridges , dentures which may be fixed or removable			0
