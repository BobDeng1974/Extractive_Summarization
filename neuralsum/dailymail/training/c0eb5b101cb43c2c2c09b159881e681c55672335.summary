by @entity0 a touching video has shown the moment a 12 - year - old dog who spent her entire life locked in a tiny cage has felt grass beneath her paws for the first time			1
the footage shows @entity11 the @entity13 stepping apprehensively across the grass weeks after she was rescued from an enclosure no bigger than 18 inches by 18 inches			1
until she was saved by the @entity18 in march , @entity17 had spent her life locked in the cage at a puppy mill in @entity21 , never leaving the confines of its four walls to play or run			1
apprehensive : @entity17 , a 12 - year - old @entity13 dog who spent her entire life in a tiny cage at a puppy mill in @entity21 , is filmed trying to walk across grass for the first time in a touching video getting there : @entity17 looks uncertain as she stumbles across grass after being rescued in march so it is unsurprising that the video shows how she is overwhelmed by the experience as she apprehensively sniffs the ground and wobbles from paw to paw			1
but in another video taken by her new owner just weeks later , @entity17 is seen full of life and leaping across the grass as she revels in her freedom			1
she has just a right eye as veterinarians were forced to remove her left one when it was found swollen and infected			2
she also had several tumors removed			0
' when we brought her in , she was terrified , ' the @entity18 's media officer , @entity47 , said			0
' these dogs know nothing of human touch			0
saved : an image shows @entity17 shortly after she was found			1
she went on to have her infected left eye removed ' the video is very cute and sweet but it 's also very poignant because it reveals what these dogs have been through			2
' she added that after @entity17 received medical care , she was put into a foster home in @entity60			1
in what the @entity18 jokingly call a ' foster failure ' , the foster parents adored her so much that they decided to adopt her , and she is now going from strength to strength			0
' she 's actually doing really well and looking much healthier , ' @entity47 said			0
' she 's running about and is used to the grass			2
she 's a lovely dog			0
' @entity47 added that puppy mills are entirely legal and the dogs ' treatment and cage sizes follow strict @entity74 @entity73 guidelines			2
on the mend : @entity17 , who is going from strength to strength , is pictured at bedtime at her new home happier times : in another video taken weeks later , @entity17 is seen hopping across the grass with ease but while it may be above board , she added that many pet owners are unaware that their puppies have been born to mothers living in such heart - wrenching conditions			1
' people do n't understand the puppies in some pet stores are coming from these places , ' she said			0
' if you ca n't see the homes and see a loving environment then look elsewhere			0
' twenty - five per cent of all dogs in shelters are pure breeds , so even though it might take a bit of time , i would tell people to look around shelters instead of going to pet stores that sell puppies			0
' puppy mills contact the rescue when they have dogs which are no longer of breeding age , and the group will rescue them			1
@entity47 added that other mills simply euthanize the dogs			0
the rescue takes in around 60 to 100 dogs a month and takes them to their shelter in @entity119 , @entity60 , where they stay until they are adopted or put into foster homes			1
locked up : the rescue center saves as many as 100 dogs from puppy mills every month ( file picture )			2
