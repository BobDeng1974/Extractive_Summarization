just 13 games in to the @entity2 season and we have already had five different league leaders			1
the latest of those , @entity6 , ascended to the top of the table with a 1 - 0 win at @entity10 on tuesday night			1
it was their fifth victory in seven games			0
perhaps more poignantly , @entity6 are unbeaten in 10 games			0
yes , four of those results have been draws , some not pretty , but they only serve to demonstrate the resiliance which makes the @entity18 arguably the most likely of the five table - toppers so far this season to be there come may 2			0
@entity22 steps up to slot home @entity6 's winner at @entity25 on tuesday night @entity26 ( right ) leads the celebrations after @entity22 scored the only goal of the game @entity30 consoles defender @entity31 after @entity33 's play - off final defeat by @entity34 the quartet of @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 and to a lesser extent @entity42 have the attacking flair to challenge @entity6 for automatic promotion , but may all lack the consistency to keep in touch with @entity30 's relentless @entity18			1
since the former @entity46 manager took the helm at the @entity48 just over a year ago , @entity6 have maintained a handy knack of churning out points , only losing consecutive matches twice and never going more than four games without a win			2
in fact , were @entity30 in charge for more than 36 games last season , then surely @entity6 would have joined @entity59 rivals @entity58 in the automatic promotion places , rather than being consigned to that agonising defeat by @entity34 at @entity33 ( which the quality of their football simply did not deserve )			1
it seems almost incredible to think of the furious fallout from @entity68 's sacking in late september last year given @entity30 's popularity in @entity6			1
@entity68 's foundation work has to be appreciated ; much of @entity30 's side was inherited from the now - @entity73 boss , but the ' @entity30 ' has truly rebuilt his reputation on these shores			2
@entity77 football aficionados will point out that he did that when winning the @entity79 league with the unfashionable @entity80 in 2010 , but it was very much out of sight , out of mind with regards to @entity30 for the @entity86 football fan			0
given his success in @entity88 , adopting the same fluid 4 - 3 - 3 system he uses at @entity6 , @entity30 was expected to bring verve and flair to the @entity93 , which he has , but it has been his ability to get the best out of seasoned @entity97 pros that has impressed and surprised most in the last year			1
while neither started on tuesday night , defender @entity98 and midfielder @entity99 have been key men for @entity6 in the last year , @entity30 getting them to fit in to a modern , @entity77 system despite their reputations as uncompromising journeymen			2
@entity6 's two key men over the last year , striker @entity22 and midfielder @entity105 , were both underperforming under @entity68 , but now look like two of the best players outside the @entity109 , and more then capable of making the step up			0
@entity22 has been a revelation since @entity30 took over and has scored 10 goals already this season @entity30 has continued to put faith in youth as @entity68 did before him , with academy - product midfielders @entity116 and @entity118 flourishing in the first - team and @entity121 winger @entity119 excelling on loan , just as fellow @entity123 did the season before			2
all in all , it has been a brilliant year or so for @entity6 under @entity30 , with 34 wins coming from 56 games ; the @entity18 losing just 10 games			2
the only blot on the copybook being that last minute @entity132 strike at @entity33			0
the last two champions in the second tier , @entity58 and @entity135 , got their noses out in front early and never looked back			0
it 's taken @entity6 13 games to get to the top - and @entity30 13 months - but they may just be there for good			1
good week for … @entity140			0
the last four days could not have gone any better for @entity142 ’s side			0
two wins , six points , six goals scored , zero conceded			0
pre-season promotion favourites in @entity147 , @entity140 started strongly but a run of just one win in six games had seen them slip some way off the automatic places			0
tuesday night ’s 5 - 0 thrashing of pace - setters @entity154 bodes well though ; it ’s now three wins on the spin for @entity142 ’s men , who are back up to fifth and just four points off @entity162 at the top of the table			1
@entity165 is mobbed by his team - mates after scoring @entity140 's fifth goal on tuesday night bad week for … @entity168			1
@entity168 ’s performances have plummeted this season along with their attendances			0
on their return to the @entity173 in september the @entity168 drew in a crowd of 27,306 , beat @entity175 1 - 0 and moved up to eighth place in @entity177			1
on saturday , just 11,888 were in attendance as @entity180 ’s side lost to unbeaten league leaders @entity182 , a result which was compounded by tuesday night ’s 4 - 1 thrashing at @entity185			0
@entity180 's side are now just one point off the bottom of the table in 20th place			0
talent scout : @entity192 ( @entity193 ) @entity34 have all but abandoned their academy in recent years as @entity195 has ploughed tens of millions of pounds into signing players , but young @entity197 winger @entity192 may be hard to ignore if his career continues on its upward trajectory			1
the 19 - year - old , just 5ft 6in , scored twice as @entity193 moved up to fifth place in @entity177 with an impressive 3 - 2 win at @entity203 on tuesday night			1
@entity192 , playing just his second game for @entity206 ’s side , also looked good on loan at @entity168 last season			2
@entity192 brings the ball down before scoring @entity193 's winner at @entity203			1

@entity6 top of the @entity2 after beating @entity10 1 - 0 on tuesday
@entity30 took over at @entity6 13 months ago with club 14th
lost play - off final in may to @entity132 's last - minute winner for @entity34
@entity140 have won two games in four days without conceding
@entity168 just one point off bottom of @entity177 table after two defeats
@entity193 's on - loan @entity34 winger @entity192 impressing
