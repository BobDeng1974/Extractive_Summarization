by @entity0 last updated at 3:57 pm on 9th february 2012 trust your doctor ? a new survey has found that some doctors fib about a patient 's prognosis , with more than half admitting they described someone 's prognosis in a way they knew was too rosy			1
nearly 20 percent said they had n't fully disclosed a medical mistake for fear of being sued			1
and 1 in 10 of those surveyed said they had told a patient something that was n't true in the past year			1
physician fibs ? about half of the doctors surveyed said they have been less than honest with a patient to give them hope when faced with a grim diagnosis but the survey , by @entity26 researchers and published in this month 's @entity27 , does not explain why , or what was n't true			1
lead researcher dr @entity29 , a @entity30 professor and director of @entity33 's @entity32 , said : ' i do n't think that physicians set out to be dishonest '			1
she said the untruths could have been to give people hope			2
but it takes open communication for patients to make fully informed decisions about their health care , as opposed to the ' doctor - knows - best ' paternalism of medicine 's past , dr @entity29 added			0
the survey offers ' a reason for patients to be vigilant and to be very clear with their physician about how much they do want to know , ' she said			0
guarded condition : the survey suggests that many doctors fail to admit a medical mistake to avoid an expensive lawsuit the findings come from a 2009 survey of more than 1,800 physicians nationwide to see if they agree with and follow certain standards of medical professionalism issued in 2002			1
among the voluntary standards are that doctors should be open and honest about all aspects of patient care , and promptly disclose any mistakes			1
a third of those surveyed did n't completely agree that doctors should ' fess up ' about mistakes			1
that 's even though a growing number of medical centres are adopting policies that tell doctors to say ' i 'm sorry ' up front , in part because studies have found patients less likely to sue when that happens			2
not revealing a mistake is ' just inexcusable , ' said dr @entity84 , a prominent medical ethicist at the @entity85			0
beyond decency , ' your care now has to be different because of what happened			0
' the vast majority of those surveyed agreed that physicians should fully inform patients of the risks , not just the benefits , of treatment options and never tell a patient something that is n't true - even though some acknowledged they had n't followed that advice at least on rare occasions in the past year			1
perhaps least surprising is that doctors give overly positive prognoses			2
best policy : the majority of those surveyed agreed doctors should never tell a patient something that is n't true - even though some acknowledged they had n't followed that advice in the past year it 's hard to deliver bad news , especially when a patient has run out of options , and until recently doctors have had little training in how to do so			1
but dr @entity29 said patients with the worst outlook especially deserve to know , so they can get their affairs in order , and patient studies have found most want to know			0
what else might doctors not tell ? there are shades of gray , said dr @entity84 , the ethicist			0
for example , he has heard doctors agonize over what to tell parents about a very premature baby 's chances , knowing the odds are really bad but also knowing they 've seen miracles			0
doctors prescribe placebos sometimes , and telling the patient could negate chances of the fake treatment helping , he noted			2
sometimes they exaggerate a health finding to shock the patient into shaping up			0
and sometimes it 's a matter of dribbling out a hard truth to give patients a chance to adjust , dr @entity84 said : ' ok , this looks serious but we 're going to order some more tests , ' when the doctor already knows just how grim things are			2
withholding the full story is getting harder , though , dr @entity29 said			0
not only do more patients @entity153 their conditions so they know what to ask , but some doctors who have embraced electronic medical records allow patients to check their test results .			0
