the police have made it clear that no crime was committed , and the dispute over the windows is a civil matter fitness coach mrs @entity10 , who also runs a @entity87 firm , had wanted to use the new annex as a gym ' yet they thought they had the right to simply turn up unannounced while i was out and , for want of better word , steal my new bi-fold windows			1
' i was left looking at nothing but fresh air where the windows should have been			2
i was only out of the house for a couple of hours at most			0
' mrs @entity10 , who planed to use the annex as a gym area for her fitness coaching , paid for the windows to be installed at her £ 730,000 four - bedroom home with inheritance money she was left by her father			1

mrs @entity10 added : ' how can it be right for someone just to turn up and take what i have paid for while i am out taking my kids to school			1
