by @entity0 published : 05:47 est , 12 june 2012 updated : 09:59 est , 12 june 2012 a stricken pensioner who fractured his kneecap after slipping on a wet step was made to wait four hours in the rain before an ambulance arrived to take him to hospital			1
@entity7 , 69 , was only kept dry thanks to the kindness of passers by who shielded him from the downpour by fashioning a makeshift shelter with their own umbrellas			1
in a desperate bid to find help for the retired civil servant , they dialed 999 six times but were told there were more important emergencies to tend to - and one operator even hung up to take another call			1
@entity25 : rotary club members and hotel workers covered @entity7 in blankets , propped his head up on a pillow , and supported his leg on a cardboard box , as well as calling 999 six times for assistance mr @entity7 , from @entity34 , @entity35 , had slipped on rain - soaked decking as he left a rotary club meeting in nearby @entity38 , leaving him unable to move for the pain and risk of further damage to his leg			1
he was left lying on the floor outside the @entity45 in @entity46 , @entity38 , for three hours and 35 minutes with a fractured left kneecap			1
mr @entity7 , a retired civil servant , was still in good spirits despite the wait , and said : ' on a very rational basis i think it ’s ridiculous that when you injure yourself you have to wait for so long			2
' it does feel like a long time but i feel relatively comfortable			0
' rotary club members and hotel workers covered him in blankets , propped his head up on a pillow , and supported his leg on a cardboard box			1
three hours and 20 minutes after the first emergency call was made , a rapid response vehicle arrived at 5:30pm			2
the paramedic apologised to mr @entity7 , and fifteen minutes later he was taken to hospital by an ambulance			2
@entity66 , owner of the @entity45 , said : ' i would have picked him up and taken him in my car but they said it ’s too risky			0
it ’s so frustrating that we ca n’t do anything			0
' long wait : mr @entity7 was left lying on the floor outside the @entity45 in @entity46 , @entity38 , for three hours and 35 minutes with a fractured left kneecap dr @entity76 , a former gp , made two of the 999 calls , and was hung - up on the second time after being told a more urgent call needed to be taken			1
the first time he called they said that there was no ambulance available			2
he said : ' i think the paramedic service is wonderful but this has got to be a terrible system			0
something needs to change and something needs to be improved			0
' it ’s frightening that the ambulance service ca n’t cope at this time of year			0
' a @entity92 spokeswoman said : ' we very much regret the time taken to respond to this call , which was received during a period of high call volume in the area			0
' whilst we can not discuss individual patient details , we will be looking into this incident , and would encourage the patient or family involved to contact us directly should they wish to discuss their concerns			0
