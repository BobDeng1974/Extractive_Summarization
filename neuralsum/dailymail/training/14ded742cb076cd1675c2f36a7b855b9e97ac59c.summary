by @entity1 reporter published : 15:04 est , 4 february 2014 @entity3 : 18:05 est , 4 february 2014 actor turned author : researchers only recently discovered that @entity7 wrote a book in 1948 a virtually unknown novel by @entity7 is now being made public for the first time			1
the comic actor ’s only novel is titled ‘ footlights ’ and is believed to be the basis for his film ‘ @entity15 ’			2
the book was written in 1948 and has a similar plot line to the 1952 film in which a washed - out clown saves a dancer from suicide			1
the book is being published in @entity23 by the @entity24 , an @entity26 film restoration institute which has been working with @entity7 biographer @entity27 on reconstructing drafts found in the @entity30 archives			1
@entity7 was born in @entity31 in 1889 to poor parents , who struggled to make a living as music hall entertainers			0
as an adolescent , he began working in music halls in @entity37 , before eventually becoming an actor with a theatre troupe			0
in his first appearance on the silver screen in the @entity42 ' , @entity7 plays a swindler -- complete with the hat , cane , moustache and baggy trousers he would become famous for around the world			0
according to @entity27 , the relationship between drunken clown and desperate ballerina in the much later ' footlights ' was likely inspired by his meeting with legendary @entity55 dancer @entity54 in 1916			0
the @entity56 describes @entity7 's ' vivid , idiosyncratic ' writing style which , ' unadulterated by editors , moves freely from the baldly colloquial to moments of rich imagery and dickensian description			0
similarities : his book @entity52 , which will be released today , has a similar plot to that of his 1952 film @entity15 wherein a washed - out clown saves a dancer from suicide ( @entity70 and @entity7 seen at right in the film ) ' for a setting , he looked back to @entity31 and the music halls of his first professional years , an enchanted period in which he had broken out of the deprivations of his childhood to discover , progressively , his unique gifts as entertainer and communicator , ' the institute said in a statement			1
' but this retrospect also recalled the painful insecurity of an uneducated , uncultured boy launched into the world of success ' , and the clown 's expressions of despair at losing the world 's respect and admiration likely reflected @entity7 's own feelings as his popularity dwindled			2
the book is illustrated with previously unpublished documents and photographs from the @entity30 archives , as well as pictures of the theatrical world of @entity7 ’s youth and images from the author 's private collection .			2

researchers only just discovered that @entity7 wrote a book in 1948
the book , called ' @entity52 ' , has a similar plot to his 1952 film ' @entity15 '
tells the story of a washed out clown saves a suicidal girl
