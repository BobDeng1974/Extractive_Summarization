a northern white rhinoceros that was just one of six left in the world has died at the @entity3			1
@entity4 , who was about 44 years old , apparently died of old age on sunday			1
he had arrived at the park from the @entity7 in @entity8 in august 1990			0
' @entity4 's death is a tremendous loss to all of us , ' safari park curator @entity9 said in a statement			1
' not only because he was well beloved here at the park but also because his death brings this wonderful species one step closer to extinction			2
' on their @entity22 page , zoo officials said the rhino had been ' under veterinary care for geriatric conditions for some time '			0
the others are in captivity in @entity3 , the @entity34 and @entity35 his death leaves only one northern white rhino at the zoo - a 40 - year - old female named @entity40 - another at a zoo in the @entity34 and three in a preserve in @entity35			1
of these , just one is male			0
@entity4 's death also comes after the death of another white rhino earlier in 2014			1
@entity47 horns are valued as dagger handles and the powdered form is mistakenly seen as an aphrodisiac			2
as a result , poaching has pushed the critically endangered rhinos to the brink of extinction			0
attempts to mate @entity4 with @entity40 were n't successful			2
just last week , preservationists at the @entity59 animal sanctuary in @entity35 conceded that their one male and two female northern white rhinos will not reproduce naturally			1
@entity27 ( pictured ) and a female rhino at the zoo failed to reproduce naturally but his semen and testicular tissue were stored to be used with rhinos in @entity35 when new reproductive technologies are developed the northern white rhino is one of the two subspecies of white rhino ( the other is the southern white rhino )			1
they were originally found across grasslands and woodlands in @entity76 and @entity77 , but now there are just five remaining			0
all are in captivity - one in @entity3 , one in the @entity34 and three at a preserve in @entity35			1
poaching through the 1970s and 1980s saw numbers dwindle			2
in the early 2000s , it was believed just five to 10 remained in the wild			0
@entity47 horns are valued as dagger handles and are mistakenly seen as an aphrodisiac in their powdered form			2
and it 's not just the northern rhino under threat			0
a rise in poaching has been encouraged by a thriving market in @entity96 and @entity97 for rhino horn , which is used as a traditional medicine believed to cure ailments and diseases , including cancer			0
@entity104 white rhinos almost went extinct at the end of the 19th century , plunging down to only 20 at one point			1
decades of conservation efforts gradually brought them back to life			0
according to the @entity111 , there are more than 20,000 southern white rhinos alive today			1
the animals were flown from the @entity34 zoo to the @entity35 conservancy in december 2009 in hopes the natural environment could be easier for them to breed there than in captivity			1
' we always knew from the very beginning that the chances of this working were small even if they bred , ' said @entity124 , chief executive of the conservancy			0
efforts will now be made to keep the species alive through in vitro fertilization			1
that experiment could take place with a southern white rhino surrogate mother			0
@entity27 's semen and testicular tissue have been stored at the @entity133 and will be used with the rhinos in @entity35 when new reproductive technologies are developed			2
' more than two decades ago we started working with the species here at the @entity3 , ' @entity136 of the @entity137 said in a statement			2
' unfortunately we only had three rhinos here at the park and they were all of an advanced age			0
we were not able to get them to breed and we have been sadly watching their species being exterminated in the wild			0

@entity4 , who was about 44 , passed away at the zoo on sunday
his death leaves just five northern white rhinos : another in @entity3 , one at a zoo in the @entity34 and three in a @entity35 preserve
efforts to reproduce the rhinos naturally have long been *unsuccessful* and efforts will now be made to keep the species alive through *ivf*
the animals are poached for their horns , which are mistakenly seen as an aphrodisiac , and they have seen their numbers plunge since the 1970s
