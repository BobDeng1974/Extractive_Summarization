by @entity0 and @entity1 prime minister @entity2 , pictured in his @entity4 constituency , insisted the @entity6 case raised questions about the welfare state @entity2 today weighed into the bitter row over linking the @entity6 arson case to the need to overhaul @entity13 's troubled benefits system			1
the prime minister backed chancellor @entity14 for suggesting the tragic case raised questions about the way some people come to rely on state handouts			1

it provoked a storm of outrage from the @entity39 , accusing the chancellor of ' demeaning ' his office			0
but today he received the defiant backing of mr @entity2 , who said mr @entity14 was ' absolutely right '			2
the prime minister added : ' he [ mr @entity14 ] said the mr @entity6 was the one to blame for his crimes , that he should be held responsible ; but what the chancellor went on to say was that we should ask some wider questions about our welfare system , how much it costs and the signals that it sends			1
' and we do want to make clear that welfare is there to help people who work hard , it should n’t be there as a sort of lifestyle choice , and i think that ’s entirely legitimate			1
in an extraordinary reaction from @entity89 , the chancellor was described as a ‘ disgrace ’ for making his comments on the day that father - of - 17 @entity6 , his wife @entity73 and accomplice @entity6 were jailed for burning the couple ’s six children to death			1
did the benefits system contribute to the @entity97 fire killings ? the jury at @entity99 had heard that one of the motivations for @entity6 ’s sickening crimes was his desire to get his hands on the benefits money which vanished when his live - in lover left with their five children			1
the subsequent row over whether the welfare system lies at the heart of the appalling case has dominated radio phone - ins and internet message boards all week			2

he replied : ‘ @entity6 is responsible for these absolutely horrendous crimes , that have shocked the nation			2
' the courts are responsible for sentencing			0
shameless : former @entity128 minister @entity127 , who filmed a documentary about @entity6 's lifestyle , said she was appalled by a state system which allowed a man to live in this way hated by the nation : @entity6 's infamous appearance on the @entity136 in 2009 when he was roundly criticised for demanding a bigger council house for his expanding brood front - page news : yesterday 's @entity27 on @entity6 's conviction ‘ but i think there is a question for government and for society about the welfare state , and the taxpayers who pay for the welfare state , subsidising lifestyles like that			1
' and i think that debate needs to be had			0
’ the chancellor has led the government ’s defence of changes in the welfare system and this week accused opponents of talking ‘ ill - informed rubbish ’			1
in the face of growing pressure from churches , charities and opposition parties , mr @entity14 said suggestions that the changes marked the end of the welfare state were ‘ shrill , headline - seeking nonsense ’			1
within hours of his remarks about @entity6 , he faced a backlash from left - wingers who accused him of ‘ cynically ’ exploiting the tragedy to push the government ’s case for cuts to handouts			1
@entity177 said the reaction of the @entity179 is proof that it still fails to grasp the depth of public fury at the way some have abused the benefits system			0

on the attack : @entity89 's @entity195 and shadow work and pensions minister @entity194 have accused @entity14 of acting ' cynically ' that move was described as the ‘ catalyst for everything that was to follow ’			2

what a sickening figure he is			0
not fit to hold public office			0
’ shadow chancellor @entity207 said mr @entity14 was ‘ cynical ’ and ‘ desperate ’ but offered no ideas about how @entity89 would combat the soaring welfare bill			1
he said : ‘ a chancellor has to think very carefully before they comment on the issues of the day			0
how they do so says a lot about the character of their chancellorship			0
‘ that is why i believe @entity14 ’s calculated decision to use the shocking and vile crimes of @entity6 to advance a political argument is the cynical act of a desperate chancellor			1
‘ we should have a proper debate about welfare reform			0
but for the chancellor to link this wider debate to this shocking crime is nasty and divisive and demeans his office			0
’ the reaction from the opposition front bench was condemned by @entity89 activist and blogger @entity233 , who said mr @entity207 had ‘ plunged ’ into a trap set by the @entity177			0
‘ @entity89 ’s strategy on @entity6 and welfare is suicidal , ’ he said			2
‘ the @entity177 want lots of stories tomorrow that have the phrases “ @entity6 ” , “ welfare ” , and “ @entity89 defends welfare ”			2
they ’re going to get them			0
‘ you do n’t need to be a master strategist to make a monkey of the @entity247 on the issue of welfare			0
