for most fathers , today is about spending time with their children and enjoying the influx of gifts and cards , but for one parent , @entity5 is one he thought he would never get to celebrate at all			1
@entity7 , from @entity8 in @entity9 , was diagnosed with @entity11 's lymphoma aged four and was told at 16 that he would never be a father			1
today , however , mr @entity7 , 38 , is celebrating his first @entity5 as a parent after a pioneering fertility treatment led to the birth of his baby son			1
@entity7 , centre , had been told that he would never be a father , but today he proudly shows his son @entity17 , right , with wife @entity18 , after he underwent pioneering fertility treatment now enjoying life with baby @entity17 and wife @entity18 , mr @entity7 says he hoped his decision to seek treatment might help others			1
' he 's a very special little boy , ' said the overjoyed father			2
' i was concerned my family line would stop with me , but now @entity17 is here , he can go on to have a family of his own			2
' being a parent - something i never thought would happen for me - is simply incredible			2
' and it 's all the more so given the hurdles @entity7 and mrs @entity31 have had to overcome			2
although mr @entity7 's sperm was all but destroyed during treatment for cancer - leaving him infertile			1
' i knew it was unlikely that i would be producing sperm but the results still come as a blow , ' he says of the moment he was given the bad news			0
' i was disappointed but not surprised			0
' i felt particularly bad for @entity18 , as she was more hopeful then i was about the result and was quite upset			2
' we talked about adoption but decided we wanted to try @entity44 with a sperm donor first so went to our local hospital for further fertility testing			1
' although the couple were resigned to using donor sperm but experts at @entity51 , a fertility clinic near @entity53 , suggested they try a new procedure known as testicular sperm extraction			0
@entity7 , right , developed @entity57 's lymphoma as a four year old and was told he would never be a father as a result , however , dr @entity59 , left , was able to use a new technique to make his dream true there are several methods of surgical sperm retrieval , which is used when there are no sperm in the ejaculate - this includes removing sperm from liquid in the epididymis where it is stored , or by extracting immature sperm from tiny pieces of testicular tissue where it is made			1
incredibly , much to their delight , an operation 18 months ago , doctors successfully found sperm , which was then frozen until the @entity81 were ready to start a family ' i was worried @entity7 might not bond with a child that was n't his own , ' adds mrs @entity31			1
' he was realistic and stoical about the whole thing - but i was disappointed for him			0
' happily for the @entity81 , the treatment worked and baby @entity17 was born by caesarian section in november last year			1
the couple 's consultant , @entity59 , said the case illustrated how difficult men found it to confront the issue of infertility			0
he added : ' for many , an appointment with me is the first time they 've been able to freely ask questions without embarrassment and often do n't realise just how common the problems are			0
' mr @entity59 said couples struggling to conceive should take an equal role investigating the causes of infertility			0
' boosting fertility with good diet and improving general health can increase the chances of natural conception , ' he added			0
' couples should also consider having a semen analysis as this can identify or eliminate issues early on and determine if further medical help may be required			0
' if there is a problem with the sperm count , then patients should be seen by a male fertility specialist			0
