by @entity0 , @entity1 , @entity2 and @entity3 published : 19:01 est , 16 january 2013 updated : 02:40 est , 17 january 2013 ten million beefburgers are being recalled in the scandal over horse meat contamination , it emerged yesterday			2
as revulsion over the issue grew , more supermarkets and fast food chain @entity11 were drawn into the row			1
@entity13 ’s , @entity14 and the co-op have decided to remove thousands of packs of frozen burgers as a precautionary measure			1
the firms acted because the products were made by an @entity22 food giant which is known to have been supplying burgers contaminated with horse meat			1
empty shelves : @entity26 had taken its frozen burgers off the shelves today not for sale : @entity26 in @entity29 had removed all its own brand burgers from sale today separately , @entity11 confirmed it gets burgers from the same company			1
however , it said there has been an ‘ absolute assurance ’ that these are not contaminated			2
food watchdogs in the @entity38 and @entity22 are racing to establish whether products made for other retailers , take - aways and restaurants are contaminated			1
last night the @entity43 and the @entity44 announced a @entity38 wide survey into the authenticity of burgers and other processed meat products			1
the revelations have been met with anger and disgust , while the companies involved face prosecutions for misleading shoppers			2
speaking at @entity55 , @entity56 , said : ‘ people in our country will have been very concerned to read this morning that when they thought they were buying beefburgers they were buying something with horse meat in it			2
this is a completely unacceptable state of affairs			2
’ he warned the stores involved , saying : ‘ ultimately retailers have to be responsible for what it is they sell and where it comes from			0
’ the alert was first raised by @entity22 food watchdogs earlier this week after horse dna was found in burgers sold through @entity26 , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 and @entity80 in @entity22			1
what goes into a value @entity82 it subsequently emerged that burgers from the same batches were sold in the @entity38 outlets of both @entity26 and @entity77			1
the beef content in one @entity89 burger sold by @entity26 was actually 29 per cent horse meat			0
the tests were carried out in november but the results were not released until they had been checked by experts in @entity94			0
it is likely that many thousands of the burgers contaminated with horse meat have been eaten by families			1
investigations are focussing on the role of @entity22 food company , @entity101 , which is run by controversial entrepreneur @entity102			1
@entity101 owns @entity103 , which supplied burgers containing horse meat to @entity26 and @entity78			1
it also makes cheap burgers for @entity14 , co-op and @entity11			1
@entity101 also owns @entity108 , which is based in @entity109 and made suspect burgers for @entity77			1
it also produces 13 lines for @entity13 ’s			1
yesterday , @entity101 pointed the finger at a mystery ingredient used in the burgers – thought to be a protein powder – supplied by two foreign firms , one in the @entity117 and another in @entity118			1
worry : @entity56 said that people were concerned about the horse meat revelations at @entity55 today the powder – used to bulk up cheap burgers – is supposed to be created from rendered down carcasses of beef animals			1
the episode lifts the lid on some of the more distasteful elements and ingredients used to produce cheap food for families on a budget			1
professor @entity138 , director of the @entity139 at @entity140 , @entity141 said : ‘ what goes into a burger is all the low quality cuts of meat that ca n’t be sold in any other form			0
they are at the bottom of the chain			2
’ the @entity44 will look at launching legal action with breaches of food labelling rules bringing fines up to £ 20,000 and a prison term of up to two years			2
headlines : the news that horse meat had been found in supermarket burgers was revealed yesterday the @entity22 research also identified that a number of other beef products , such as ready meal cottage pies , contained pig meat that was not declared on the label			2
this has serious implications for the @entity162 and @entity163 communities who are forbidden from eating pork			0
@entity26 had no idea about the contamination and has apologised			0
its group technical director , @entity168 , said : ‘ our customers have the right to expect that food they buy is produced to the highest standards			2
’ @entity14 , @entity13 ’s and the co-op all insisted there was no evidence their burgers contain horse meat			1
however , they decided to withdraw them because they come from firms which are known to have had this problem			0
gone : burgers had also been removed from other supermarkets today			1
@entity14 in @entity186 , @entity185 is pictured same supplier : fast food giant @entity11 was drawn into the row today as it uses the same supplier as supermarkets where burgers were found to contain horse meat @entity13 ’s said : ‘ although our products have not been implicated , as our customers would expect we treat matters like this extremely seriously			1
’ @entity14 said : ‘ as soon as we were made aware of the issue we launched a full traceability audit with our supplier			1
’ co-op said it was removing two lines of frozen own - brand burgers while tests are carried out ‘ to ensure they have been produced to our strict specifications ’			1
@entity11 said it has been given ‘ absolute assurance ’ by @entity101 and @entity79 that none of its burgers were affected			1
it said its burgers are produced with clean ingredients on a separate production line			2
for many , it is simply a matter of economics			0
while calling the vet to put down a lame or surplus horse can cost in excess of £ 200 , abattoirs will gladly pay £ 300 for an unwanted animal			0
as a result , 8,118 horses and ponies were slaughtered in @entity38 in 2011 , to be sent to the continent to be sold as gourmet meat			0
nothing is wasted , with their skins going into the leather trade , while any off - cuts will be used as dog food			2
most will be former pets their owners can not care for or riding school mounts that can no longer pay their way because they are too old to work			0
but according to @entity236 , a campaigner with charity @entity237 , in 2011 ‘ 1,127 were thoroughbreds discarded by the racing industry ’ , which ‘ overproduces horses each year ’			0
the number of @entity38 horses ending their days in the slaughterhouse has doubled since 2008 , a little - known consequence of the recession			0
mr @entity236 said around 10,000 horses and ponies are now believed to be slaughtered in @entity38 each year			0
‘ with belt - tightening following the recession , it is often luxuries such as horses that face the chop , ’ he said			0
‘ it makes sense they would end up in slaughterhouses rather than paying a vet a fee or trying to sell them on			0
‘ the real scandal behind the horse slaughter figures is that the volume of horses being produced for the pet and horse racing industries is unregulated and out of control			0
’ permitted methods of slaughter include shooting with a bullet , or stunning with a penetrative bolt followed by immediate bleeding			0
there are two major abattoirs that take horses in @entity38 , but they are not keen on publicising it			0
several thousand live horses are believed to be sent to the continent for slaughter			0
customers in @entity277 , @entity278 and @entity279 like horse meat			0
small amounts are also eaten in @entity118 , @entity282 , @entity283 and @entity284			0
a spokesman for the @entity44 said almost all @entity38 horse meat is exported			0
‘ it is legal to slaughter and sell horse meat in the @entity38 , provided it is from an approved abattoir and the meat must carry the stamp declaring it is fit for human consumption , ’ he added .			0
