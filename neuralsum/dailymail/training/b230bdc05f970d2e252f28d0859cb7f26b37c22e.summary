i 'll have what she 's having by @entity3 you ca n’t be a woman and not think you need to go on a diet or get a face transplant , writes @entity3 at the start of her journey into the bizarre world of celebrity dieting			1
she exaggerates — but only a little			2
like it or not , celebrities are role models for many of us			2
we crave their fame , glossy hair , glowing skin and fabulous post-baby bikini bodies			2
and whether from a prudent desire not to upset the public ( adoration can turn sour in an instant , as @entity26 , @entity28 et al know only too well ) , or because they have books and fitness apps to flog , celebrities almost never admit that their astonishing beauty is a lucky accident of fate — the equivalent of winning the genetic lottery			2
@entity3 was surprised to find @entity26 ’s recipe for roast fish with anchovy salsa verde was delicious instead , they talk about superfoods , elimination diets and kale smoothies , holding out the tantalising possibility that , if only we had their self - discipline — and unlimited supplies of kale — we , too , could find ourselves sharing a joke at the @entity50 with @entity51 and @entity52			1
fascinated by the fact that the easiest thing to discover about most celebs is what they consume , @entity3 set herself the alarming task of following the diets recommended by 16 celebrities , from @entity60 to @entity61 , to find out if we really are what we eat			1
her self - imposed rules were simple : try to keep exactly to the diet recommended by her chosen celebrity			2
also ‘ buy any cookbook a celebrity wrote , even if it looked really bad			2
and i would try to employ exercise regimens , clothing choices or dinner parties when appropriate ’			0
would she achieve her ideal body at the end of it all ? would she have any friends left ? there was only one way to find out			1
@entity60 , with her formidably wholesome diet and much - mocked lifestyle website , @entity81 , where she is currently recommending a chocolatey confection called sex bark and products from @entity87 health shop @entity85 , is the @entity88 of diet - conscious modern celebs			1
after a food allergy - related panic attack , she was inspired to write it ’s @entity94 , a cookbook that eliminated ‘ bad ’ foods , such as bread , red meat and cow ’s milk , in favour of healthier alternatives			0
the astonishing cost of the ingredients for @entity26 ’s seven - day detox — almost triple @entity3 ’s usual weekly food budget — was a shock , and the recipe for turkey and arugula meatballs came out an offputting shade of green			1
but when she consciously uncoupled from the diet , having followed it for ten days , she had lost 4 lb and discovered @entity26 ’s recipe for roast fish with anchovy salsa verde is totally delicious			0
from this high point , it was downhill all the way			0
@entity122 ’s diet includes the cheering element of a ‘ controlled pig - out ’ ( she liked a whole pizza followed by a hot fudge sundae ) , but it made @entity3 sick			1
@entity128 ’s regime involves ten @entity129 a day and a sinister recipe for quail ( ‘ emaciated birds with dinosaur claws ’ )			0
an attempt to live like @entity61 , following the diet and exercise regime with which @entity138 ’s sister apparently maintains her famous posterior , while holding themed parties from her book , celebrate , came adrift when haggis , the essential ingredient of a @entity144 supper , proved illegal in @entity146			1
( it contains lung , apparently a prohibited substance in the city			0
) @entity3 made do with a lung - free , tinned version , but it was n’t the same			1
you ca n’t plunge a ceremonial dagger into the steaming heart of a tin			0
as the diets get more bizarre ( @entity157 recommends chewing food then spitting it out ) , @entity3 ’s attempts to follow them become increasingly perfunctory			1
by the time she gets to @entity163 ’s diet ( vodka and tonic , watercress soup ) , she lasts three days			0
at the end of it all , her weight remained exactly the same , but she was surprised at how much insight she had gained into celebrities by following their diets : ‘ i never quite imagined i would understand so much about the women i profiled through their food			1
‘ @entity175 was very refined			0
@entity122 just wanted to drink ! @entity26 is great at everything , even healthy eating			0
i had a certain affinity for all of them after a while			0
’ in the end , she concludes , we should n’t copy celebrities , but pity them			1
‘ instead of derision , [ they ] need compassion ! their lives are horrible ! ’ a thought worth remembering next time you ’re tempted to embark on @entity189 .			0

@entity3 tested out 16 diets recommended by celebrities
from @entity60 to @entity61 , she tried them all
but did @entity3 achieve an ideal body at the end of the *gruelling* *process* ?
