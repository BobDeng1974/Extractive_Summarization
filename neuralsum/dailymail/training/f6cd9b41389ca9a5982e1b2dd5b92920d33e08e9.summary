by @entity0 published : 16:16 est , 21 july 2013 updated : 16:16 est , 21 july 2013 @entity1 : for most of my 27 - year marriage i ’ve enjoyed a tender and romantic sex life , but in the past year my husband has changed			1
he barely approaches me , is far less tactile and verbal and sometimes abandons lovemaking halfway through			1
i ’ve tried to talk about it , but he shrugs me off			0
how can we recapture our joy ? after 27 loving and romantic years , her man has become distant and seems to have lost his sex drive answer : there ’s nothing more distressing than finding the person you love best has become a stranger to you			1
there ’s a temptation to think , ' is it something i ’ve done ? ' , but in reality that ’s rarely the case			0
the change is baffling precisely because some external agency is involved			0
cynics might suggest another woman , but you would surely be aware if your husband was addicted to his phone and spending hours away from home ? typically , it ’s the erotically unfulfilled who stray , while you say the pair of you have enjoyed a good sex life			1
my guess is that the problem is physiological or psychological — or a combination			1
if your husband has enjoyed an untroubled sex life into middle - age , the sudden onset of impaired libido would prove a huge shock to his sense of self			1
numerous health issues from heart disease to diabetes can play havoc with desire and men ’s ability to sustain an erection			0
around half of men aged 40 - 70 will suffer from erectile dysfunction at some point and 80 per cent of cases stem from physical causes			1
the biggest clue is that your spouse abandons sex without achieving orgasm			1
that suggests a problem with male plumbing , because a man with a steady erection does n’t tend to pull away			2
two of the most common causes of a depleted libido are depression and stress , but a failing appetite for sex can , of itself , make one feel low			2
has your spouse had anxieties in the past year ? the most robust men can go off sex if their professional or financial security is threatened			2
many men ’s sexual vitality is index - linked to their sense of success ; take that away and they wilt			2
put it like this : no man who ’s made a bad investment , or seen his company ’s stock price plummet , will feel sexy			0
the more they bottle up the truth , the worse they feel — ashamed that their emotions and self - discipline have failed them , let alone their winning streak			2
the problem can be intensified by the fact most frequently prescribed antidepressants tend to suppress libido			0
for that reason i would check your husband ’s medicine cabinet in case , unknown to you , he ’s taking a drug that has personality - altering side - effects			1
above all , you must ensure your husband goes to see his gp			0
small changes , such as exercising and reducing alcohol intake , can have a big impact			0
if your husband is suffering impaired blood flow to the genitals this might be the first symptom something ’s wrong with his heart ( chest pains arrive later ) , so it ’s crucial he has a full check - up			1
i would also talk to your husband ’s family and friends to see if anyone else has noted @entity134 last line of resort is to make it clear how distressed you feel and how you can cope with anything — even a lack of lovemaking — if communication is restored			0
the key is not to put more pressure on your husband , while coaxing him into seeking a solution			0
it ’s a delicate dance , but once you ’re allies again , it ’s a far shorter step to rekindling your lover ’s flame .			0

i *'ve* enjoyed a romantic sex life for 27 years but things have changed
my husband barely approaches me and is much less tactile
