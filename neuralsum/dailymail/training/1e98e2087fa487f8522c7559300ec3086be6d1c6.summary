when @entity1 started getting labor pains , she decided to get in the car and head to the midwife 's clinic			1
not forgetting what the 33 - year - old went through with her second child @entity8 last year , she covered the back seats in blankets , just in case			1
but as they drove towards the @entity14 in @entity15 , @entity16 , it became more apparent that history was going to repeat itself			0
during the 25 - minute journey to the clinic , their third child , @entity19 , was born in exactly the same spot as her older brother - on the @entity26 exit ramp to 42nd street			1
family : @entity1 , 33 , holds new - born @entity19 in front of her eldest son @entity30 , three , and his brother @entity8 ( bottom right ) who was also born on the ramp between 42nd street and the @entity26 in @entity16 , @entity35 last thursday mrs @entity1 and her software engineer husband @entity36 , 49 , thought they had left enough time to avoid having to pull over			1
but during the 25 - minute journey , the contractions became more intense , prompting the mother - of - three to shout : ' oh no , it 's happening again			2
' stop the car ! stop the car ! the baby is coming , ' she screamed			0
mr @entity46 thought they could make it to the nearby @entity50 medical center , but his wife shouted : ' you 've got to catch her , or she 's going to go on the floor			1
' her husband then leaned over in the suv and grabbed the infant who was crying			0
he then handed her to his wife and wrapped the new - born in a blanket			0
they then continued onto their intended destination , and @entity19 is said to be in good health			0
' i was kind of nervous , ' mr @entity46 told the @entity63 , ' because i was driving , and i had to pay attention to her and see how she reacted , because the baby could pop out anytime			2
' on february 15 , 2013 , mrs @entity1 , went through an identical experience			2
throughout the day her labor pains had been sporadic , according to the paper , but then they started coming more frequently			0
' we were like , oh , my word , we have to leave now , ' she said			0
as they stopped on the stretch of road , nurses from the nearby hospital rushed out after mr @entity46 in , saying that his wife had just given birth in their car			1
their first child , @entity30 , was born in a hospital			0
now , after their second roadside delivery , what 's their plan if there 's a fourth child ? ' if there is , ' mrs @entity1 said , ' maybe we 'll just go park there ( at the @entity14 ) a month early or something , or as soon as the first contraction hits			1
' when he kids are older , the stay - at - home mother plans to go back to the spot and take a picture			0
mr @entity46 told the paper : we wanted to avoid this happening again			2
but it not just happened , it happened in the same place ... @entity100 does strike twice in the same place birthplace : @entity101 came into the world on the highway ramp between the @entity26 and 42nd street on thursday in @entity16 , @entity35			1
