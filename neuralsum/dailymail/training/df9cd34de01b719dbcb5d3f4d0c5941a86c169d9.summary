@entity1 lawmakers are holding their ground and refusing to fund the proposals president @entity4 laid out in his @entity6 address			1
having already panned his pitches as ' unserious ' and ' dead on arrival , ' republicans are now threatening to shred most of @entity4 's budget , due for release on tuesday , the moment it lands on their desks			1
' he is the most liberal , fiscally irresponsible president we ’ve had in history , ' @entity18 chairman @entity17 told the @entity22 after seeing a preview of the president 's spending requests			2
' i do n’t know why he does n’t see it			0
' the @entity28 on thursday admitted that it does n't expect the president 's budget to pass ' in its current form			1
' rather , it considers the document ' a way that we can codify our values and our priorities			1
' president @entity4 is pictured here in the @entity39 of the @entity28 giving a speech today			1
yesterday , @entity4 revealed that his 2016 budget would ' fully reverse the sequestration cuts for domestic priorities ' and increase defense spending @entity4 told @entity45 on thursday he would ask for a $ 74 billion in 2015 above the ceiling mandated by a bipartisan agreement			1
the @entity28 confirmed that @entity4 will ask @entity48 to trash the sequester			1
' no way , ' @entity51 sen. @entity50 said in response to the news			1
' initial peak at @entity59 budget shows same wonderland mentality that @entity61 can tax and spend its way to prosperity am ppl ca n't be fooled , ' @entity56 sen. @entity55 tweeted			1
@entity17 told the @entity22 the @entity65 is ' facing a debt crisis not because @entity65 are taxed too little but because the government spends too much			0
' in his @entity6 address @entity4 presented an ambitious framework of revenue increases that place even higher tax burdens on financial institutions and wealthy @entity65 and would raise $ 320 billion over 10 years to pay for his favored programs			1
but @entity1 have firmly dismissed any attempt to increase revenues through those means			2
' i do n’t know any @entity1 , myself included , that would support any of that , ' @entity78 sen. @entity77 told reporters last week , using the ' dead on arrival ' refrain			1
' i think it 's pretty clear that that ’s a non-starter , and i think the president knows that , ' @entity88 rep. @entity87 told @entity89			2
' those kind of tax increases would just be devastating to the economy			1
and you know we still have a very fragile economy			0
' @entity1 after @entity1 has slammed the new measures as bad for the same @entity65 it purports to help - the middle class - since his joint appearance before @entity48 last week			2
' president @entity4 stayed the course of tax , spend , borrow , regulate , and add to the debt			1
this policy has hammered working families , ' @entity78 's other senator , @entity105 , also a @entity1 , said in a statement			2
' instead of trying to manipulate our tax code to punish success , president @entity4 should work with @entity48 to fundamentally reform our tax code in ways that will grow our entire economy and provide relief to all families , ' @entity110 sen. @entity109 said			2
@entity120 sen. @entity119 contended that @entity4 was tone - deaf and did not ' hear ' the @entity65 peoples ' message in november when they ousted his party from power in the upper chamber			2
' he intends to do precisely the opposite ' of what they voted for , @entity119 said			0
' he intends to double down on the failed policies of the last six years			0
he intends to have yet more and more government spending and taxes and debt and all of the policies that are hurting hardworking @entity65			0
' house speaker @entity134 accused @entity4 of ' more of the same approach that has failed middle - class families			2
' ' @entity138 proposals may make for good political theater , he said , but ' they will not distract this new @entity48 from our focus on the people 's priorities			2
' senate majority leader @entity144 said that in digging in his heels @entity4 ' missed ' and opportunity for ' bipartisan , constructive engagement			2
' ' we know the president may not be wild about the people ’s choice of a @entity48			0
but he owes it to the @entity65 people to find a serious way to work with the representatives they elected , ' the @entity1 leader said			2
moderate @entity45 are waiting until @entity4 's budget is unveiled to determine whether @entity4 and the @entity28 ' have really gone too far left , ' @entity158 , co-founder of left - aligned group @entity159 indicated to @entity161			1
' we are big believers in dealing with the long - term mandatory spending crisis and driving economic growth for the middle class , ' he said of his organization , ' and we hope to see some of that when the whole budget comes out			0
' @entity4 has already had to strike one of his changes to the tax code from his budget in the last week after he faced blow back from @entity1 and @entity45 alike , including the top @entity172 in the @entity28 , @entity173 , and the no. 2 @entity172 in the @entity18 , @entity174			1
the president wanted to amend the rules pertaining to popular college savings accounts often referred to as 529s as part of his plan to reform the tax code			0
used most often by the wealthy , the @entity28 wanted to begin taxing withdraws from the investment accounts			0
@entity45 argued that too many middle income @entity65 use the accounts , though , for that to be a smart source of revenue for @entity4 's free community college tuition plan that 's been promoted as a boon for average @entity65 families			1
building on the @entity6 , @entity4 offered a preview of his budget on thursday in an op - ed for the @entity193			1
' we have to build on the bipartisan budget agreement i signed in 2013 that helped us end some of the arbitrary , across - the - board budget cuts known as " sequestration , " ' the president wrote			2
' in order to get wages and incomes rising faster , we need to take the next step			0
that 's why my budget will fully reverse the sequestration cuts for domestic priorities in 2016			2
' not only does the president intend to give the @entity210 back the money it would lose next fiscal year if the sequester were allowed to take effect , he will propose ' equal dollar increases for defense funding			1
' ' if @entity48 rejects my plan and refuses to undo these arbitrary cuts , it will threaten our economy and our military , ' he said in his op - ed. ' investments in key areas will fall to their lowest level in ten years , adjusted for inflation , putting @entity65 research , education , infrastructure , and national security at risk			0
' but if @entity48 joins me , we can make sure that ending sequestration is fully paid for by cutting inefficient spending and closing tax loopholes			0
' yesterday , @entity4 told @entity45 he would ask for a $ 74 billion in 2015 above the ceiling mandated by a bipartisan agreement in his budget , due out next tuesday			1
he is pictured here at their retreat in @entity239 , @entity240 the @entity28 said thursday that the president 's budget is based on his belief that is possible to ' make our tax code fairer and more simple , and do it all in a way that ’s fiscally responsible			1
' @entity4 's spokesman , @entity248 said , the @entity28 believes ' there is a better way that we could have succeeded in reducing the deficit ' than sequestration - and that would have been to raise tax rates on @entity255			1
' but in some ways , those are debates for the past			0
what we want to talk about now is the future			0
and i do think that the strategy that the president has laid out - focusing on middle - class families - is one that certainly deserves strong bipartisan support in the @entity48 , ' he said			0
@entity248 contended that ' no president has ever put forward a budget with the expectation that @entity48 is going to pass it in its current form , ' he said , even when the executive and legislative branches of government were controlled by the same party			0
still , president @entity4 's budget is ' important , ' he said , because it ' codifies the president ’s values and vision for the country			1
' ' but @entity1 in @entity48 will certainly have their say and we look forward to seeing what they put forward , ' he noted			0
looming cuts to defense spending is a problem that @entity4 and @entity1 who favor a robust military agree must be resolved			1
at a @entity290 hearing on the sequester on wednesday the committee 's chair , @entity51 sen. @entity294 , said the @entity65 is en route to shaving $ 1 trillion off of its defense budget by they year 2021			1
' if we in @entity48 do not act , ' @entity294 said , and the sequester goes into effect next year , @entity48 will be ' setting our military on a far more dangerous course			0
' ' why would we do this to ourselves now ? ' he said , recalling the global crises of late , including @entity308 's invasion of @entity309 and @entity311 ' violent rampage across @entity312 and @entity313			0
@entity294 said the @entity314 and @entity315 wo n't have enough forces if the sequester kicks in and the @entity318 wo n't have enough planes			0
the aircraft the @entity318 will in many cases ' be too old , ' he said			0
continuing , he warned , ' our soldiers , sailors , airmen , and @entity315 will not get the training or equipment they need			0
and it will become increasingly difficult for them to respond to any number of contingencies that could threaten our national interests around the world			0
' quoting retired @entity315 general @entity333 , who spoke to the committee on tuesday , @entity294 said : ‘ no foe in the field can wreck such havoc on our security that mindless sequestration is achieving			0
’ @entity294 ally , @entity340 , a @entity1 from @entity341 told @entity342 he 'd even consider tax increases to stop sequestration			1
' whatever it takes within reason to get this problem fixed is what i 'm willing to do , ' he said , adding that he 'd do what it takes ' just to get the damn thing done			0
' @entity340 's eagerness to raise revenues to save the military is not shared by the entire @entity1			1
' a lot of this gets down to whether or not the president is willing to work through tax reform and entitlement reform , or decide he wants to raise taxes , ' @entity1 rep. @entity1 told the @entity22			2
' i do n’t believe @entity1 are willing to raise taxes			0
