by @entity0 a small study suggests mosquitoes contribute to the problem of childhood obesity in parts of the @entity6 mosquitoes contribute to the problem of childhood obesity in some parts of the @entity6 , a small study suggests			1
researchers from @entity12 in @entity13 led an experimental study to investigate whether the amount of time children spent playing outside varied depending on whether the mosquito population was controlled or not			1
they found that children spent more time outside in areas with effective abatement compared to those with lots of mosquitoes to conclude effective control of mosquitoes could play a role in cutting the rate of childhood obesity			1
the scientists asked 38 children from @entity30 and @entity31 between 2009 and 2012 to log the time they spent outside , when treatment to kill mosquitoes was alternated between the two places to see if there was a correlation			2
@entity38 , lead author of the paper published in the @entity40 admitted the study was limited because of the small number of participants and children 's self - reporting , but believes the results were clear			0
children living in areas where effective action was taken to cull the mosquito population spent more time exercising outside			2
he said : ' because obesity is difficult to treat , public health efforts need to be directed toward prevention , which could include mosquito abatement since physical activity protects against obesity			0
' the study also found that 75 per cent of the local population said they would spend more time outside if it was n't for mosquitoes and households spent $ 86 a year on their own mosquito controls , indicating that they take the problem seriously			2
distribution of @entity69 mosquitoes in the @entity6 , by county , researched in 2000			0
the mosquitoes invaded 30 states in 1985 and are believed to have hitched a ride on shipments of car tyres from @entity76 scientists said people spent an average of an extra two hours a week exercising in the outdoors when the mosquitoes were kept under control			1
the study is one of many seeking to quantify just how much misery mosquitoes cause			0
a project by scientists at @entity87 focused on the impact of the @entity89 - a particularly blood - thirsty species that has colonised half of the @entity6 since 1985			1
they said that at times the mosquitoes were so plentiful they kept children indoors and passive during the summer months			0
while the cost of pest control is considerable , @entity95 , a population geneticist at the university said the cost of not controlling them could be childhood obesity			2
the $ 3.8 million study into @entity103 in @entity104 shows the pests negatively affect people 's quality of life			0
because obesity is difficult to treat , public health efforts need to be directed toward prevention , which could include mosquito abatement since physical activity protects against obesity , ' said mr @entity114 spent an average of an extra two hours a week when mosquitoes were kept under control @entity120 @entity69 mosquitoes invaded 30 states in 1985 and are believed to have hitched a ride on shipments of car tyres from @entity76			1
while they are not thought to transmit serious diseases in the @entity6 , they spread dengue and the chikungunya virus in the hotter climates of @entity131			0
scientists are examining the mosquitoes as the @entity6 @entity134 , which is part funding the @entity87 study , wants to work out the best way of controlling the pests before they start carrying disease as the @entity6 climate warms up			1
professor @entity141 , the project organiser , told @entity143 : ' mosquito control in urban settings came first , and the children 's physical activity idea was birthed from that			0

two scientific studies conclude mosquitoes prevent children and **adults** exercising outside in certain parts of the @entity6 in summertime
@entity6 scientists from @entity12 and @entity87 , believe the effective control of mosquitoes could help *decrease* childhood obesity
children and **adults** spent more time - an extra two hours a week - exercising outdoors when the mosquitoes were kept under control
