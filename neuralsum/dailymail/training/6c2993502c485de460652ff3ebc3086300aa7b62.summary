when new mother @entity1 noticed bruises on her legs and constant back ache , she put the symptoms down to her recent pregnancy			1
the 19 - year - old had no reason to suspect it was a sign of something more sinister			1
but after visiting her doctor , the mother - of - one was immediately referred to hospital where tests revealed she was actually suffering chronic myeloid leukaemia			1
@entity1 , 19 , blamed her bruised legs and back pain last april on her recent pregnancy - shortly after giving birth to her son @entity18 , now 16 months , pictured ms @entity1 , a full - time mother , said : ' in april last year i was getting stomach pains and coming out in bruises , but could n't explain what was causing it			1
' eventually , she put the bruises on her leg down to her new son @entity18 gently pinching her skin			1
she added : ' i had back ache quite early on , but my mum said she had back ache for about a year after having my brother , so that 's what i put it down to			1
' but one day i felt so sick , had a headache and my stomach was really swollen			0
i had big , lumpy bruises too			0
@entity36 said " something is not right "			0
' after doctors diagnosed miss @entity1 's cancer , they kept her in at the @entity41 for two nights , while deciding the best course of medication			1
she said : ' i did n't know anything about leukaemia so i was n't look for the signs because i did n't know what they were			2
' even when i was getting bruises i had put it down to the baby			2
i think a lot of people wo n't be sure what it is so i want to raise awareness so other people know what to look out for			1
' it was hard on my partner , @entity60			0
he is a car valet and had to take unpaid time off work to look after our baby			0
that was quite a hard time			0
the mother - of - one visited her doctor , who immediately referred her to hospital where tests revealed miss @entity1 was in fact suffering chronic myeloid leukaemia miss @entity1 , who says she will one day have a brother or sister for baby @entity18 , is raising awareness of the disease , having not been aware of the symptoms before she was struck by the blood cancer @entity79 is a cancer of the blood forming system in the body			1
it originates in the bone marrow - the soft inner part of your bones			0
in leukaemia , abnormal white blood cells are made in the bone marrow			0
white blood cells usually circulate around the body in the blood stream and protect the body from infection			0
but in leukaemia the cells do not work and do not fight infections			2
around one in four people with chronic myeloid leukaemia will have no symptoms when they are diagnosed			1
but other patients will suffer : ' when @entity60 had to go back into work my mum and dad were able to step in and help out			0
my family have all been brilliant			0
' when she is ready , miss @entity1 said she hopes to have another child			1
@entity18 is now 16 months old			1
she said : ' professor @entity109 at the @entity110 said it 's not impossible for me to have children again			0
' this may be feasible once the leukaemia has been successfully treated for another year or two			2
' i 'm grateful i 've got @entity18 and he 's healthy but it would be nice to have a brother or sister for him			2
' prof essor @entity109 , a consultant haematologist , said : ' symptoms of leukaemias are often vague ' everyday ' complaints such as tiredness , aches and pains or maybe recurrent infections , that do n't go away with simple measures			1
' there may even be no symptoms , as they are sometimes diagnosed on a blood test in an unrelated routine check - up			2
' it is always worth seeking medical advice if you have easy bruising , as with @entity1			0
' a simple blood test via the gp is all that is needed to rule out a leukaemia or similar blood disorder			0
