dreams of leaving school and making it big in @entity3 usually consist of breaking into something like tv , banking or politics			1
but when @entity10 , 21 , made the journey three years ago from his home near @entity13 in @entity14 to find his fortune in the capital , his business plan had little to do with stocks and shares or television scripts			1
he had already decided to make his living by selling sex to other men			1
@entity10 , 21 , claims he is a successful male escort because of his young looks @entity10 said of his first job after leaving school : ' when i was in @entity14 and on dating websites , i did kind of know that i was attractive to guys , but then when i moved to @entity3 and started going to bars i realised there were lots of people who are attracted to me			1
' so i figured out pretty early on that i could make money from being an escort			1
' i do n't think that i will do it for many more years , definitely not when i 'm 30 , but it has paid for my future so far			1
' since then , the baby - faced 20 - something has made almost a million pounds , owns his own cocktail bar in @entity42 , has a book in the pipeline and runs his own website selling sex toys			2
he is also the proud recipient of a dubious award : in 2011 , he was named @entity48 at the @entity49			1
with a few years of work under his belt , he is now putting his efforts into changing the @entity55 public 's idea about prostitution , claiming it is a career just like any other			1
@entity10 is widely considered to be one of the most successful escorts of his generation , making hundreds of thousands of pounds a year from the business			1
his youthful appearance and knack for self - promotion means that he can command up to £ 1,500 a night for his services			2
@entity10 , 21 , shortly after arriving in @entity3 from @entity14 - escorting was his first job in the capital ' it ’s based completely on time , if someone wants to have sex or go on a date or whatever , it ’s all based on time , there are no hidden charges ' i do n’t usually do a whole week , because people ca n’t afford it , but sometimes i have gone to places like @entity79 - i would charge between £ 10,000 and £ 12,000 for that			1
' weekends are more normal , i get those fairly regularly and that ’s around £ 4,000			2
' ' the clients are wide - ranging , with some just wanting to have sex , while others would rather do anything but that			2
he said : ' it totally varies , depending on the client , obviously some are just hiring me for sexual services			2
' but then some are hiring me for the whole experience , where we would go out to the theatre or something , then for a meal and back to my place or to their hotel - that ’s a boyfriend experience			2
' there are the other ones who just want companionship , so they come to my place and we just sit on the couch and have a glass of champagne or a cup of tea and we just sit there and talk			2
@entity10 tried his hand at modelling but only as a sideline to his escort work ' for those kinds of people it ’s a confidence thing - if some of them have n't come out as gay and are never going to come out , it ’s their only outlet to do that kind of thing			1
' or some of them might be older or even disabled and it has knocked their confidence to go out and meet people , so i 'm an easier solution			2
' then there are the people who just do n’t have time to meet people ; the business people who are millionaires or billionaires that fly into @entity3 and just want convenience , they do n’t have time to go on chat rooms or whatever			0
' those billionaires are the biggest demands when it comes to his time			0
despite their money , they may still be hiding their sexuality from friends and family , so put heavy restrictions on @entity10 's time , often making for bizarre situations			1
he said : ' i stayed at the estate of a @entity153 oligarch for a weekend , which was the biggest eye opener			0
' it had a lake with a boat and 4,000 trees , several outhouses for staff and a garage the size of a townhouse - it made the properties in an episode of cribs look like they belonged on @entity168			0
@entity10 being presented with the gong for @entity48 at the @entity49 in 2011 ' he offered £ 3 million to basically buy me , he said that if i lived with him for two or three years , he 'd write up a contract , transfer the funds and have everything done legally when it came to making payments			1
' i would even have been restricted on where i could go - with breaks to see family and friends " every now and then " ' i was so insulted and i told him , " when i 'm ready to be a millionaire i 'll make myself a millionaire thanks			0
" ' that was the first client and one of a small few i was n't able to get along with , i refused to meet him			0
' i rent my time , body and mind like every other working person does but i do n't sell those things for someone to take ownership			0
' another client even offered to hand over his estate when he died			0
@entity10 said : ' one guy in @entity191 i met a few times developed a fixation , he even offered to sign his millions over to me in his will and buy me a penthouse in @entity191 to live near him			1
' i ended up leaving the country and cutting off all communication because it just got too much			0
' but this job was never going to come without huge risks - he has had several stalkers and after a couple of hairy incidents while working from his @entity205 flat , he also does n't keep any sharp objects at home			0
he said : ' i have had situations where i ’ve had to throw people out when i thought they might get violent or i thought they had no money			0
' you have to be very streetwise - you have to be aware of your surroundings , i do n’t even keep sharp objects or anything that could be used as a weapon in my home			0
' i have one sharp knife but will move it whenever a client comes around , so it is n't somewhere obvious			0
@entity10 works for a charity for sex workers called @entity222 in his spare time ' i 've also had a few stalkers , people who have ended up hanging around and even sleeping outside my building			1
' but on the whole , @entity10 has been incredibly fortunate to have avoided any violent attacks , unlike many sex workers in the @entity55			1
it is for that reason that he now volunteers for a charity called @entity222 , that offers assistance to escorts and prostitutes to protect them from violence			0
he said : ' my side of the charity is about awareness , speaking to escorts when they come to me for advice			0
not all of us are in it out of choice either , i could leave tomorrow and get another job if i wanted to , but other people do n’t have that			0
' and the more i come out and talk about this issue , the more sex workers might be able to come forward and get the help they need			0
