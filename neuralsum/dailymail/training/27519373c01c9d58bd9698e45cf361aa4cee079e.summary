bridges boasting dramatic waterfalls , sweeping cycle lanes and vibrant light displays are just three of the ideas that have been submitted as part of an international competition to design a new crossing over the @entity8			1
dozens of proposals have been put forward as part of the contest , which called on architects and engineers to create a creative and practical route between @entity16 , in @entity17 , on the @entity18 , and @entity19 on the north side of the river			2
and now @entity22 , which is organising the competition , is inviting @entity23 to vote on the 74 proposals to help jurors decide on which designs will make it through to the next stage of the process			1
the designs , which are being showcased online and at local exhibitions , are now undergoing a detailed technical assessment			0
next month , the jury panel will recommend a shortlist of up to four teams to go through to the next stage and to develop more detailed plans			0
there are currently five possible sites for the new bridge			0
the most likely option , according to a brief by @entity43 , will stretch from just south @entity44 in @entity19 to near the new site for the @entity46 in @entity17			2
the proposed scheme , which will cost an estimated £ 40million is being hailed as a much - needed transport link by officials south of the river			1
@entity51 is facing opposition from @entity53 , who argue it will be detrimental to the local environment			0
@entity56 : this proposed design would see pedestrians climb along the edge of a dramatic waterfall , bringing a touch of fantasy to the @entity8 futuristic : one of the bridge designs in the international competition features three separate paths that weave and curve across the river striking : this unusual design has a multi-coloured structure built above and alongside the cycle and pedestrian crossing vibrant : massive pink spirals around the bridge would be mounted with bright pink lights - allowing the bridge to twinkle after dark proposed sites : the exact location of the bridge has not been chosen , but option one or option two are most likely , according to officials angular : this proposed design would be supported by a series of interlinking metal structures that would reach to the riverbed simple : this more streamlined design offers two separate routes for pedestrians and cyclists to avoid congestion along the bridge iconic : if the above design was chosen , the large curved structure would add a striking mark to the ever - changing landscape of south @entity98 sweeping : this design allows cyclists and pedestrians to enjoy winding ramps up to the main crossing , with benches incorporated on land sleek : this bridge extends out in a giant curve from the banks of the river , and incorporates strips of light that illuminate it after dark modern : this design , titled ' @entity114 ' , will be illuminated by coloured lights embedded in the structure of the bridge after dark clean : this bridge design is defined by a large arch over the river , which supports suspension cables for the base below splash of colour : red support pillars and beams brighten up this design , which has been submitted to the international competition green : this design incorporates attractive gardens dotted with flowerbeds and trees at the landing point of the bridge practical : this bridge ties together two elevated walkways - leaving pedestrians free to walk along the riverfront below two separate paths lead on to this bridge , which is built on a subtle curve and looks out on to @entity145 ( left ) dynamic : this twisted bridge transforms from brown to rainbow - coloured as it stretches across to the @entity18 stylish : it is not clear how the bridge connects to the ground in this design , but it would offer users impressive views of the city attention to detail : images inset in this design offer a close - up view of the landing points and the bridge 's tension ribbon and arch structure seamless : glass and metal combine to create this light and airy design , which gives users plenty of opportunity to admire the views sculptural : this streamlined design rises elegantly off the banks of the river - and incorporates eyecatching art installations at either end fluid : in this design , the bridge curves upwards from the ground to form a wide road across the water , with designated cycle routes minimalist : in this innovative design , the bridge is suspended over the water as if unsupported , offering unobstructed views across the city			1

£ 40million crossing will connect @entity16 , on the @entity18 , with @entity19 on the northern side of the @entity8
waterfalls , vibrant light displays and sweeping cycle paths are *included* in proposed designs from around the globe
