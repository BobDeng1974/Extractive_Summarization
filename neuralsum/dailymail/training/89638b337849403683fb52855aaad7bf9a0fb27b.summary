@entity0 has issued a defiant warning that the @entity3 crash must not be used for ' selfish political ends ' and urged separatists to allow international experts access to the crash site			1
wearing a dark suit and looking tired and drawn during a rare television address , the @entity9 president insisted ' all people ' in @entity13 had a responsibility to the families of the 298 passengers and crew who died last week			1
but he added : ' no - one has the right to use this tragedy for any kind of vested interest in the political sense			1
such incidents should unite people rather than separate them			0
' his comments came just hours after @entity28 issued a stark warning to @entity0 that his billionaire ‘ cronies ’ will have their assets frozen in @entity31 unless @entity9 co-operates with the investigation			1
hitting back : wearing a dark suit and looking tired and drawn , @entity9 president @entity0 issued a defiant warning that the @entity3 crash must not be used for ' selfish political ' advantage rows of bodies : bagged victims can be seen above lined up in front of a truck yesterday at the crash site , ready to be moved to the refrigerated trains final indignity : rescue workers , pictured above , loaded the corpses onto trucks at the crash site in eastern @entity13 , which were then taken to refrigerated train carriages nine miles away meanwhile , @entity0 has been examining samples of aviation equipment at the @entity53 there are already representatives of @entity56 and @entity57 working there , as well as representatives of the emergencies ministry of @entity13 and others			1
but this is not enough			0
this task force is not enough			0
we need more , we need a fully representative group of experts to be working at the site under the guidance of @entity68 , the relevant international commission			2
we must do everything to provide security for the international experts on the site of the tragedy			1
we need to do everything to provide its [ @entity68 commission ’s ] safety , to provide the humanitarian corridors necessary for its work			0
in the meantime , nobody should and has no right to use this tragedy to achieve their narrowly selfish political goals			0
we repeatedly called upon all conflicting sides to stop the bloodshed immediately and sit down at the negotiating table			0
i can say with confidence that if military operations were not resumed on june 28 in eastern @entity13 , this tragedy would n’t have happened			0
during his television address this morning , @entity0 said it is necessary for ' all people ' involved in the current conflict in @entity13 take responsibility for their actions			2
he said there was a duty to : ' improve their responsibility to their own people , and to the people of the countries whose representatives have been victims of this crash '			2
@entity0 added , ' we need to do everything to ensure the security and safety of the observers and the experts working at the crash site			1
' the comments came as chancellor @entity116 said the @entity117 was prepared to take an ' economic hit ' in order to put pressure on @entity121 over its involvement in the @entity13 crisis			0
@entity28 , meanwhile , is due to make a statement to mps later spelling out what measures he believes should be taken following the apparent shooting downing of the plane by rebels			2
in what was described by @entity132 as a ' frank ' conversation last night , the prime minister told mr @entity0 his support for insurgents in eastern @entity13 had ' contributed to an appalling tragedy ' and the delay in experts being able to investigate was ' indefensible '			1
the chaos surrounding the handling of the crash has compounded the grief of families all around the world bereaved by the crash , who have been left unable to arrange funerals or properly mourn their dead			0
@entity151 's relatives have made emotional appeals for the bodies to be returned as soon as possible , amid reports that the refrigeration in the carriage has only been inconsistently working			1
earlier the bodies of almost 200 victims of the @entity3 plane disaster were seen decaying for a fourth day in a refrigerated train			1
since the bodies of the 298 victims fell from 33,000ft after their plane was struck by a surface - to - air missile , they were left in the open in sweltering heat for three days before being gathered up in bags , bundled on to trucks and driven away			2
grisly : the bodies of almost 200 victims of the @entity3 plane disaster were seen for a fourth day in a refrigerated train which has done little to hold back the stench of decay which has already overtaken the corpses stench : a rebel can be seen holding his nose as the door to a carriage containing the heaped bodies is opened the bodies were taken from there to the town of @entity184 , nine miles away , where they have been piled up in four refrigerated train carriages			1
the refrigeration has done little to hold back the stench of decay which has already overtaken the corpses amid accusations the rebels are holding up the return of the bodies unnecessarily			2
rebel commanders have reportedly promised that the train will leave this afternoon , but gave no indication of where or whether the bodies would be handed over			2
further pressure will be put on @entity9 to cooperate with the crash investigation at the @entity201 , after @entity117 , @entity202 and @entity203 came to the agreement that the @entity205 must be prepared to ratchet up sanctions if they refuse			1
it was not immediately known what the @entity209 team would do with the black boxes , but there was speculation they would pass the boxes on to experts with experience of reading the data a @entity209 investigator , left , takes a black box as it is handed over by a @entity222 official in the city of @entity56 a meeting of @entity205 foreign ministers tomorrow is expected to result in a more punitive sanctions regime , with mr @entity0 's ' crony group ' possible targets			1
the threats of extensive sanctions on @entity9 billionaires has already spooked a number of wealthy @entity234 businessmen and women			1
' the economic and business elite is just in horror , ' @entity236 , the head of the @entity237 in @entity121 , told @entity242 news			0
' nobody will speak out because of the implicit threat of retribution ... any sign of rebellion and they ’ll be brought to their knees , ' he added			0
one billionaire , speaking on condition of anonymity , added that @entity0 risks becoming a pariah figure as wealthy and powerful @entity9 seek to distance themselves from him to keep hold of their money			1
the prime minister likened the failure to tackle @entity0 to the appeasement of @entity260 in the 1930s , while foreign secretary @entity262 said @entity9 risked becoming a ' pariah state ' if it carried on arming rebels the prime minister likened the failure to tackle @entity0 to the appeasement of @entity260 in the 1930s , while foreign secretary @entity262 said @entity9 risked becoming a ' pariah state ' if it carried on arming rebels @entity203 arms sales and @entity202 dependence on @entity9 fossil fuels have been seen as possible barriers to tougher measures , but @entity117 will argue that the whole union must share the burden			1
a no 10 source said the @entity117 wanted additional names to be added to the list of @entity9 subject to travel bans and asset freezes under the existing criteria for @entity205 sanctions			1
these could include ' entities ' - firms or organisations - as well as individuals involved in supporting efforts to destabilise @entity13			0
but there will also be an effort to extend the scope of the sanctions , to allow those who are influencing or supporting the ' @entity9 regime ' to be targeted for sanctions , meaning oligarchs within mr @entity0 's inner circle could be named			1
in a round of broadcast interviews this morning , mr @entity116 accepted that @entity117 could not escape unscathed from taking such action against @entity121			0
' this is about living in a world where international borders are respected , where commercial airliners are not shot down , " he told @entity307 's today programme			2
' it is absolutely in @entity117 's national economic interest that that is the case			0
' of course any sanctions will have an economic impact , and we are prepared to undertake further sanctions			0
' but think of the economic hit ... of allowing international borders to be ignored , of allowing airliners to be shot down			0
that is a much greater economic hit for @entity117			0
we are not prepared to just allow that to happen			0
' investigation : @entity9 president @entity0 has urged separatists ( right ) to allow international experts ( left ) access to the crash site masked and armed : a pro-russian fighter guards the crash site of @entity329 near the village of @entity331 in eastern @entity13 the separatists placed bodies from the downed @entity334 in refrigerated train carriages in the rebel - held town of @entity184 , nine miles from the crash site , and said they would remain there until the arrival of an international aviation delegation			1
they also claimed the plane 's black boxes had been recovered and would be handed over to the @entity345			0
the @entity117 is supporting an @entity347 attempt to secure a @entity201 @entity349 ( @entity349 ) resolution , which would demand ' safe , full and unfettered access to the site " and for the bodies to be handled with respect and dignity			1
' a @entity132 source said @entity9 had blocked an attempt to agree a press statement by the @entity349 and the government was ' realistic ' about the prospect of success in getting a resolution through without it being vetoed			0
meanwhile , the @entity362 set out the evidence it claimed it had for @entity9 separatists being behind the atrocity			2
secretary of state @entity366 said it was ' pretty clear ' that an sa - 11 missile system had been transferred by @entity9 into the hands of the separatists .			2

@entity9 president urges @entity373 *leaders* not to politicise @entity3 disaster
says nobody has the right to use tragedy for ' any kind of vested interest '
also called on separatists to give investigators full access to crash site
comments come amid threats @entity9 billionaires could have international assets frozen unless the country cooperates with crash investigation
@entity28 issued stark warning that @entity0 's ' cronies ' were under threat
new sanctions could be *imposed* at a meeting of @entity205 ministers tomorrow
meanwhile bodies of 200 @entity3 victims are still decaying on *motionless* train
*undignified* scene with *swarms* of flies has *sparked* international outrage
