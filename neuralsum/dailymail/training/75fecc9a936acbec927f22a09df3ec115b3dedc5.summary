by @entity0 published : 09:37 est , 16 september 2013 updated : 11:41 est , 16 september 2013 a couple had to put their wedding on hold after an owl which had been chosen to carry the rings fell asleep in the roof of the church			1
the bride had secretly arranged for the bird to swoop down to the altar with the wedding bands attached to its feet by tassels			1
but the spectacular stunt failed when the barn owl , called @entity18 , took to the rafters to enjoy an impromptu snooze			1
bird brain : this was the moment a church wedding had to be halted because an owl chosen to carry the rings fell asleep it remained perched high inside the 900 year - old @entity29 in @entity30 , @entity31 , for an hour after falling asleep			1
rev @entity32 , who was in charge of the ceremony between @entity35 , 46 , and @entity36 , 49 , tried to coax the animal down but his efforts were in vain , so he decided to continue the service by using a back up set of rings			1
he said : ' it would have been absolutely superb - if it worked			2
it was a lovely idea and it was supposed to be really stunning			0
' it was a complete surprise to the groom , although the bride was in on it			2
it was the bride ’s mother ’s idea			2
' the groom is into falconry as a bit of a hobby and so it was secretly arranged for two falconers to suddenly appear at the moment when the best man hands over the rings			2
' this chap popped up at the front of the church next to us with a gauntlet on , as another chap appeared at the back of the church with a box			2
' the owl appeared , and took a bit of coaxing to take to flight it paused for a little bit , eventually saw the gauntlet , and then took off			0
halted : the @entity75 in @entity30 , @entity31 , where the wedding was briefly stopped as the owl took to the rafters for an ill - timed snooze ' but instead of landing on the arm of the man by us and delivering the rings it went up over our heads and landed up in the roof space			1
' the idea was it would be amazing and would swoop over the heads of the guests , and they ’d all feel the air rushing from its wings , but it did n’t quite work like that			2
' rev. @entity32 added : ' we all had a bit of a laugh about it , and then we tried to get it down , but it did n’t come			1
' in fact it fell asleep			0
it presumably thought ‘ i ’m a barn owl , this is like a barn ’			0
' we had a plan @entity107 they say never work with animals , so we had a back - up pair of rings			1
' after a few minutes , we gave up trying to get it down and carried on			0
it was actually rather nice when we went up for prayers and the owl was right above us			0
' the couple , from @entity116 , had left the chuch by the time dozy @entity18 was finally brought back down			2
' the chaps were there for probably an hour , and in the end had to get a long ladder to go up and get it down			1
' i thought it would be a really beautiful and interesting thing to do at a wedding			0
' it ’s important that people realise that a church wedding does n’t just come as a package of things you have to do , and there ’s no room for creativity			0
' i ’m all for including something of the personality and individuality of the couple getting married			2
' @entity18 was booked to deliver the rings to mr @entity142 and miss @entity35 as they tied the knot			1
@entity35 , a mother - of - two , said : ' @entity36 is a twitcher , so the owl delivering the rings was a surprise gift from my mother			1
high up : the bird was in the roof of the 900 - year - old church for an hour before it flew away ' the owl is a ring bearer so the idea is that it 's meant to fly in with the rings attached to some ribbon and deliver them			1
' when the owl flew in though it seemed really distracted , i 'm not sure if maybe it was spooked by something , but he just was n't concentrating			2
' it 's meant to fly straight into the glove of a falconer who then takes the rings off , but instead the bird disappeared into the rafters			1
' it probably felt really at home because the inside of the church is a little like the inside of a barn , so it just ended up sleeping			0
' she added : ' we waited for about 15 minutes for the bird to come down but it did n't come			0
' instead we went ahead with plan b , we had back up rings ready because they do n't always do as they 're told - a bit like all animals and children really ! ' i 'm glad that the bird did n't come actually , it did n't ruin the big day at all , in fact it added to the humour			1
' it was such a magical wedding and it was so full of emotion , it was nice to be able to have a bit of a laugh			0
' luckily the service was able to go ahead and my husband was able to hold the bird and have some really nice pictures taken after the ceremony			1
' @entity18 belongs to @entity202 , who runs wings over @entity31 which promotes the bird as ' a ring - bearer ' for weddings			1
his website says : ' in the recent months we have added to our collection of birds of prey			0
' @entity211 came to us as a four week old ball of fluff and has settled in perfectly			0
' @entity18 was hand reared and is now ready to embark on the many ideas we have for her			0
' the site adds : ' why not forget the traditions and have the beautiful @entity18 fly the wedding rings over the congregation to the alter ? it is a stunning performance to make your day extra special			0
' after the ceremony , if you would like , we would be part of the photographs or entertain the guests with our other birds			0
' we can colour coordinate @entity18 's ribbons and the ring pouch to what ever colour you would like to make your day as perfect as possible			0

@entity35 , 46 , and @entity142 , 49 got married at the @entity29 in @entity30 , @entity31
the bride hoped the bird would swoop down with the rings attached to its feet by tassels during the ceremony
instead , it flew into the rafters to enjoy an hour - long nap
rev @entity32 was forced to use a set of pair of back - up rings
