striker @entity1 , 16 , shattered his tibia in a horror tackle during a @entity5 match two weeks ago			1
he was taken to hospital for an x-ray , before being sent home to recover in a plaster cast			0
however , the teen was shocked to wake up the next day to find councillor @entity24 - who had refereed the match - had sent him a @entity12 message making fun of the horrific injury			1
it read : ' sorry to hear of your “ broken ” leg , probably happened during the 15th roll , not the challenge ! ' it ’s only a crack , not a real break			2
football is a physical game played by men			1
' maybe think about netball or rounders in future			1
' @entity43 , who sits as mayor for the town of @entity6 , @entity7 , is now facing charges of improper conduct by @entity48			1
today , @entity1 said he was ' disgusted ' to have received the sarcastic messages			2
' i knew straight away it was a horrendous tackle but the ref was saying if i ’d really broken my leg i ’d be crying , ' said @entity1 , who lives with his mother @entity54 , 38 , in @entity6			1
' he even said he was going to book me for diving			0
after i dragged myself off the pitch , the ref never came to check if i was ok or show any concern really			0
' then he sent me these sarcastic messages on @entity12 making fun of me and saying i should play netball or rounders instead			1
a ref should n’t behave like that			0
when i found out he was mayor , i could n’t believe it			0
' he added : ' my main worry is that he ’s going to ref other games			0
his job is to protect the players but he showed me no sympathy - he should take these things seriously			0
' @entity1 , who is on the books of @entity76 club @entity75 , now fears his football dreams may be over due to his injury			2
' disgusting ' : the @entity12 message from councillor @entity24 poked fun at @entity1 's horrific injury he must wear a plaster cast for six weeks and doctors have told him he can not play football again for six months until his leg fully heals			1
he said : ' i ’m gutted , i was meant to play with @entity75 on monday , but obviously i could n’t			0
' i ’ve played football for ages , it ’s so frustrating , i ’m desperate to get back on the pitch			2
ms @entity54 said she was ' furious ' with the @entity12 message			1
' it is very unlike @entity1 to go down			2
he does n’t dive , he only goes down if he has been hurt - that 's how i knew something was wrong , ' she said			0
' the ref went over to him and said " get off the floor , you would be crying if you had broken your leg " , before carrying on with the game			0
' when @entity1 got home from hospital , he went straight to sleep , then woke up to find the @entity12 messages			1
' it was shocking - how can someone act like that ? he is supposed to be protecting the people of the town , not acting like this			0
' i want a full apology from the referee and i hope he does n't referee ever again			0
' @entity48 said they were investigating allegations into @entity24 's behaviour on and off the pitch			2
