@entity0 : the story of our shore by @entity4 we are an island race , — which means , in practice , we are a coastal people			1
no one in @entity10 lives as much as 70 miles from the sea			1
our coastline of 10,800 miles is longer than @entity13 ’s ( unbelievable ? try measuring the ins and outs of @entity16 ’s )			1
many people in the @entity18 , @entity19 or @entity20 never see the sea in their lives			1
but most of us are saturated with it in childhood — in holiday homes and beach huts with deckchairs and sandy sandwiches , shivering and occasionally baking in the capricious arms of the sea			1
people are drawn back to the sea in their retirement , staring once more and feeling as they did as children			1
our attachment to the coast is strong			1
popular television series explore it , gliding over the cliffs by helicopter as if in a dream			2
coastal paths are never short of walkers			0
@entity4 ’s book is written to celebrate 50 years of @entity47 , the @entity48 ’s campaign to save our coastal beauties from being spoiled — by purchasing them			1
beginning in 1965 , the @entity48 has by now acquired 742 miles of coast			1
our attachment to the coast is strong			1
popular television series explore it , gliding over the cliffs by helicopter as if in a dream and coastal paths are never short of walkers naturally , the @entity48 mainly bought up the wilder shores to preserve their wildness , which is why you wo n’t find any popular resorts among them			1
this suits @entity67 ’s taste , because his childhood holidays were partly spent on @entity70 , off the emptiest part of the @entity72 — an island with only one hut , where his parents chose to stay			2
he goes back to stay on @entity77 alone , evoking not only its emptiness , but also its dreamy union of sea and land — good for meditation for a night or two , though not for a fortnight ’s holiday			2
he also waxes fondly on the loneliness of beaches and headlands			0
he even has a love affair with @entity90 , @entity91 , a radar spying station kept top - secret and out of bounds by the @entity94 for 80 years			0
he likes the spookiness of its decaying laboratories , toxic testing sites and the tales that were told about the secret base called @entity101 , which was rumoured to have housed the @entity102 that supposedly landed in nearby @entity103 in 1980			0
but who would want to visit the @entity90 now we can , heaven alone knows			0
@entity67 sails keenly for two of the inhabited islands off the coast			2
@entity110 and its attendant islands were places of monkish contemplation for @entity115 and @entity116			0
@entity118 , with a permanent population of 28 get - away - from - it enthusiasts , in summertime adds 60,000 visitors , who come to see the puffins			0
he loves the cliffs and chasms off @entity126			0
walking the tops of them is , he says , ‘ the next best thing to flying ’			0
when i was young , we stared with fascination at another mysterious island because no one was allowed to land on it			2
@entity136 , in @entity137 , had belonged since the 1920s to the eccentric mrs @entity139			0
for 40 years , she kept all human beings out ( with an armed guard ) , while allowing only animals running wild to share it with her			0
when she died , in 1961 , the @entity48 was given the island by the @entity146 in lieu of death duties			1
it took nearly 50 years to clear the wild rhododendron that had overrun it			0
now , it is partly open as a nature reserve , but it lacks its old mystery now it ’s no longer surrounded by notices , saying : ‘ keep out ! ’ @entity4 has provided a tempting introduction to many little - known stretches of our coastline , with helpful instructions on how to get to them ( although they do not include places to stay )			2
he is the right man to salute the preservation of our coast : the @entity48 ’s miles are the only part we actually have the right to stand on as common land			1
the rest of the waterline belongs to the @entity175			0
as a true coast - lover , @entity4 once proposed to a girlfriend by drawing the invitation in the sand and taking her up a dune to read it			2
she said : ‘ yes ’ .			0

as an island race , no one in @entity10 lives more than 70 miles from the sea
@entity47 is the @entity48 *'s* campaign to save the coastline
since starting in 1965 the @entity48 has acquired 742 miles of the @entity190 coast
