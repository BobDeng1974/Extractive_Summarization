another co-founder was @entity14 , the one - time leader of @entity15 ! the @entity16 reported monday that @entity14 's wife financially supported the @entity21 's 2012 @entity20 @entity19 campaign with donations totaling $ 1,750			1

among its initiatives was an unfulfilled plot to destroy power lines leading to a nuclear power plant			1
@entity14 , then @entity15 's leader , pleaded guilty to conspiring in that plot			1

he later paid a $ 250 fine			0
other @entity15 activists including @entity14 's wife also served on the @entity2 group 's board of directors while @entity1 was its chairman			1
the @entity57 ' home often served as the organization 's meeting place during that time			2
in a documentary film titled @entity15 : the @entity61 , @entity14 spelled out his green pressure philosophy			2
' we are n't fooled for a minute that we ’re engaged in the liberal reform , ' he said			0
' we 're sticking a wrench in the system , we 're slowing it down , we 're thwarting it , we ’re kicking it in the face			0
' that ' monkey wrenching ' philosophy often extended to the personal lives of business and government leaders who the group saw as putting economic progress ahead of the planet			0
' the earth is not dying , ' its official motto read			0
' it is being killed			0
and those who are killing it have names and addresses			0

@entity96 reports showed that @entity97 , the so - called ' @entity97 ' who ran a deadly bombing campaign in the @entity20 from 1978 to 1995 , was first inspired to kill after reading such a hit list published by @entity15 ! his first murder victim was @entity101 , an advertising executive at @entity102			1
