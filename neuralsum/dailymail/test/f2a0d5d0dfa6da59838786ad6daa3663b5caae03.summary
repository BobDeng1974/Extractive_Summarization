@entity0 by @entity1 who likes rejection ? whether you are being rejected by a lover , an employer or a barman who serves a newly arrived regular customer before you , it ’s galling			1
and in every case there ’s nothing we can do about it			1
nothing that does n’t carry a long prison sentence , anyway			2
it would take someone exceptionally optimistic and uncynical to propose an alternative thesis , and @entity1 is both of those			1
born into a family of teachers , @entity1 was so determined to become an entrepreneur that , as a child in @entity24 , he dug a hole in the garden , intending to reach @entity28 by the shortest route			1
he eventually made the journey by conventional means , and found a good life there			2
wife , children , several degrees , job in middle management			0
but he was n’t happy			0
he wanted to take risks , start his own company			0
it does n't matter where it comes from - no one likes being rejected and in each and every case there ’s nothing we can do about it ( picture posed by model ) the problem was he inevitably encountered rejection , mainly from potential backers for his project ( another @entity55 app no one could possibly need or want )			1
and each time , rejection felt like the @entity56			2
a successful entrepreneur needed to be more robust than this			0
so , having possibly read one self - help book too many , @entity1 decided to embark on his own rejection - proofing quest			1
instead of avoiding rejection , he would spend 100 days deliberately seeking out situations in which he was likely to be rejected , film them and put them up on his blog			1
all of which seemed to me , at first glance , rather artificial			0
there have been any number of ‘ quest ’ books , in which humorous writers have gone round @entity71 with a fridge , for example , less for the sake of doing it than to write a book about it			0
but @entity1 is n’t a humorous writer			1
he may adopt a light - hearted tone , but his quest was deadly serious			2
on day one , he went up to a security guard and asked if he could borrow $ 100			0
the security guard said no , and @entity1 almost broke into a run to get away			1
watching the video later , he said he looked like the man in @entity88 ’s @entity87			2
on day two , he went into a burger joint and , noticing a sign on the soft drinks machine saying ‘ free refill ’ , asked the cashier for a burger refill			0
the cashier said no. but as he continued his quest , @entity1 realised there were ways and ways of asking			1
show confidence , inject a little bit of humour , be willing to negotiate and you might not get exactly what you want , but you might get something			0
so he walked into @entity106 and asked for a set of five iced doughnuts , interlocking in the manner of the @entity111 symbol			0
the woman behind the counter looked thoughtful			0
‘ when are you looking for these ? ’ she asked			0
15 minutes ? ’ ‘ let me see what i can do , ’ she said			0
you can see what happened next on @entity118			0
and so develops a surprisingly entertaining study of rejection in all its many manifestations			1
people confuse it with failure , but rejection is personal , and we take it personally			2
the crucial point is that rejection is unavoidable and it ’s how we respond to it that matters			1
@entity1 ’s extreme positivity can grate at times but his message is sound : rejection is only someone else ’s opinion , and it may not be the right one .			1

it does n't matter where it comes from - no one likes being rejected
and in each and every case there ’s nothing we can do about it
@entity1 , with his exceptional optimism , proposes an alternative thesis
he has developed an entertaining study of rejection in all its many forms
