by @entity0 published : 20:43 est , 26 november 2013 updated : 20:43 est , 26 november 2013 four out of 10 doctors do not think inquiries into @entity4 failings - such as at @entity5 - will have a positive impact on the way their hospital works			1
almost half also remain fearful of the personal consequences of raising concerns about poor patient care , a poll of 800 hospital doctors for the @entity15 found			1
around a third admit to having witnessed poor patient care that they did not report but now wish they had			1
four in ten doctors do not think that inquiries into @entity4 failings will have a positive impact on their hospital when asked why they did not report the incident , 67 per cent worried that they would not be supported by management , 48 per cent worried they would not be supported by their colleagues and 49 % feared raising concerns would have an impact on their career			1
of the 371 who raised concerns about a colleague , 47 per cent said their concerns were addressed			0
but for the 178 who raised concerns about their organisation , only 18 per cent found their concerns were addressed and 43 per cent said nothing happened at all			0
two - fifths of all doctors surveyed have ' little or no confidence ' that the recent inquiries into failings in healthcare will have a positive impact on the culture of their health trust			2
and 65 per cent said imposing criminal sanctions on staff for wilful neglect would create a culture of fear			0
dr @entity55 , director of policy and communications at the @entity15 , said : " the @entity15 has long argued that better care for patients in the @entity4 would come through creating the right culture ; this can not be achieved through legislation			2
@entity5 was the subject of a damning inquiry into standards of care ' by creating a culture of openness and learning , we believe doctors , nurses and other healthcare professionals will not only be in a position to raise patient safety concerns with confidence that they will be supported , but they will also be in a position to drive continuous improvement in standards of care			2
' whilst introducing a new criminal offence for wilful neglect may seem like a strong measure , our survey of hospital doctors shows many believe it is more likely to create a greater climate of fear with the risk of less focus on patients , not more			0
this is not what the @entity4 needs			0

a third of doctors admit to witnessing poor patient care , but did not report it
less than half said concerns where addressed when they did report them
