by @entity0 over 10,000 historic maps of @entity2 have been scanned and made available online by the @entity3			1
the library has also unveiled a radical new ' warping ' feature that allows users to superimpose any of the maps onto modern - day @entity2 to see changes			1
it allows users to virtually fly around the maps , seeing just how @entity12 has evolved			0
' @entity3 has now scanned nearly all of its public domain @entity2 atlases , a collection of now more than 10,000 maps , ' @entity41 of the library revealed in a blog post announcing the project			1
he also revealed the ' warper ' tool that allows the old maps to be put on top of new maps			0
' we have also built a web tool where users both inside and outside the @entity3 can virtually stretch old maps onto a digital model of the world @entity60 or @entity61 , thus creating a new copy that is not only aligned with spatial coordinates on the @entity16 , but normalized across the entire archive of old maps			2
' the library worked with staff , volunteers , and interns , a group of roughly 1,500 participants worldwide to complete the ambitious project			0
this is the first time the majority of the maps have been made available online			0
an 1863 map of @entity77 that is opart of the collection			0
it 's library entry reads : ' entered according to @entity81 in the year 1863 by @entity82 , in the @entity83 of the @entity84 for the @entity85 of @entity86 ' @entity87 hopes to expand to project to create a ' historical @entity89 ' for @entity2 , with everything from restaurant menus to pricing in stores from the city 's past			1
' if we have documents related to past times and past places ( old maps ) , then we can create data to ' rebuild ' those past times and past places			0
57 maps of @entity2 electronically stitched together in the software an early map of @entity2 ' if we ' rebuild ' old places in virtual space , we can then organize a universe of other information around those old places			2
' @entity112 € ™ t it be great to have yelp.com and @entity114 , but for old restaurants and with old menus and prices ? or to have at least a smattering of old photos in a historical street view ? or to search the @entity121 using a map interface ? an early map of @entity124 in @entity2 that forms part of the new collection an early map of @entity2			1

users can *choose* a map and superimpose it on today 's @entity2 to see *differences*
reveals how @entity2 has evolved over time
@entity3 hopes to add restaurant menus to create a ' historic yelp '
