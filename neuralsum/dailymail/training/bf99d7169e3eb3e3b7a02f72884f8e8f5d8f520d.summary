@entity0 are dealing with a mice infestation at @entity2			1
a hygiene report , seen by @entity4 , reveals @entity0 are working with pest - control contractors to sort out problems with rodents in the @entity8 stands			1
and it is understood that the vermin problem has spread to other parts of the ground , with rodents even spotted in staff offices			1
the problem is thought to be linked to the famous stadium ’s canalside location			1
in 2012 , a similar report identified issues with mice in the staff canteen at the @entity80 while in 2010 a mouse was pictured scurrying over the pitch during @entity0 ’s victory over @entity39			1
six years earlier , @entity85 players complained that there were mice all over the pitch during their @entity29 clash with @entity0			1
the hygiene report , carried out last year , tells staff to ‘ continue to act on the recommendations of the pest - control contractor in connection with the mice activity ’			1
it also advises them to make sure no food or waste is left out			1
@entity0 say they carry out weekly checks and implement ‘ immediate and appropriate action ’ if mice are spotted			1
a club spokesperson said : ‘ @entity0 implements a robust pest - control system throughout @entity2			1
as the report acknowledges , weekly checks are made in all catering areas and stringent measures are taken to ensure high levels of hygiene and cleanliness wherever food is stored , prepared and served			1
if incidences of this nature do occur at the stadium , immediate and appropriate action will be taken			1
