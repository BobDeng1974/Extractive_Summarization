by @entity0 the language of love does not come easily to 22 - year - old graduate @entity3 , a freelance film - maker diagnosed with @entity5 ’s syndrome six years ago			1
inappropriate outbursts or swearing make it difficult for him to approach women , although in an ironic twist , being in love helps minimise the effects of his condition			0
‘ being in love is like a form of medication for my @entity5 ’s , ' he reveals			1
' when i ’m sleeping next to someone i have no @entity5 ’s , no insomnia , no nightmares , nothing			1
his co-stars include men and women with dwarfism , a man with @entity38 's and even a woman with @entity41 syndrome , a condition that causes the face to distort			1
but with 70 per cent of @entity46 people saying that they would n't even consider dating a person with disabilities in a recent sex survey , @entity3 and his co-stars are facing an uphill struggle			1
@entity3 's story began at the age of 15 when he woke up one morning and noticed he had a small twitch in his head and neck			1
within three months he was dealing with physical and vocal outbursts and the effect on his life was devastating			0
@entity5 ’s syndrome is a neurological condition that affects the brain and nervous system			1
named after @entity66 doctor , @entity5 , who first described the syndrome in the 19th century , it is characterised by involuntary noises and movements			1
tics are usually vocal ( grunting , coughing and shouting ) or physical , with typical movements including jerking the head or jumping up and down			1
most sufferers are first diagnosed during childhood and it is linked to adhd and obsessive compulsive disorder			0
source : @entity78 ‘ initially my parents had no idea what was going on and assumed that as a teenager going through puberty , it was a phase			0
' when i was diagnosed i was determined to try and get on with my life like any other 15 - year - old but it was incredibly difficult especially as i was living in a small town at the time and i really stuck out which was very isolating , ' admits @entity3			1
although he was still dating his childhood sweetheart at the time , the impact of his diagnosis put enormous strain on the relationship			0
when they split up five years later , @entity3 was devastated and the effects on his health were disastrous			2
‘ i was at university and , unfortunately , the @entity5 ’s feeds off low points in my life			2
i was so ill my weight dropped to seven stone			0
' doctors managed to help me with medication and i slowly recovered			0
i started going out and making friends but the anxiety of going on a first date can bring on the tics and i can start twitching or swearing			0
' in the back of my mind , i am always worrying that the @entity5 ’s is going to draw attention to me , and therefore to my date , which will make her feel really awkward because the whole room will be staring at her			2
film maker : @entity3 in a still for a mini documentary he made to document his battle with @entity5 's devastated : when @entity123 and his childhood sweetheart broke up , the effect on his health was disastrous ' going out with me is like going on a date with a live grenade and hoping that it does n’t go off			1
i hate the awkward silences because that is when the @entity5 ’s really wants to come out			2
' i can never tell how my @entity5 ’s is going to act			2
i wish i could keep it at home on the days i am going on dates , ' says @entity3			2
he now hopes that his appearance on @entity32 , his second , will help him overcome his dating hang - ups and find that special someone			1
but his foray into tv has n't always proved the impetus he 's looking for			0
in the last series , he met bar worker @entity141 , 19 , and hit it off with her during a snowboarding trip			0
constant anxiety : going out with @entity3 is like ' going on a date with a live grenade ' sadly , it fizzled out soon after the cameras stopped rolling			2
' we dated a few times and really got on well			0
' i could relax in her company and that kept my tics at bay			0
but sadly the initial spark fizzled out but we have remained good friends and still keep in touch			0
' since i appeared on the show people recognise me around town and have been friendly and understanding about my @entity5 ’s which has given me a huge confidence boost			2
‘ i have gone out with my mates and while i do n’t go up to a girl and tell her i have @entity5 ’s , if we get into conversation i ’ve found that talking about the condition can actually be an ice - breaker			2
has @entity3 found love ? he was instantly won over by @entity172 's confidence and playful personality ' but , ' he adds , ' i would still like to find love which is why the producers matched me with another date			1
' this time , he was matched with @entity172 , 26 , an actress and model and @entity178 admits : ‘ even the @entity5 ’s voice in my head was shouting , " boom , jackpot ! " ' her confidence and fun instantly won @entity3 over and she was n’t fazed by his tics			1
‘ i shouted out loud during one of our dates and it just passed over her head like it had n’t happened			0
' the second time when it happened i laughed and she just cracked up as well			0
no matter how crazy or strange the disability that a person may have , they are just normal people and what is most important is being treated like you are n’t different			0
romance : @entity3 says being in love helps to minimise the symptoms of @entity5 's syndrome ‘ simple things like a kiss on the cheek or someone showing concern for me when i ’m having a really bad tic can help calm me and it also shows their acceptance of me			1
' he and @entity211 spent their first date on a pedalo which @entity3 admits was a bit too ‘ cheesy ’ for either of their tastes but quickly followed it up with a gig at a club in @entity220 to watch the @entity221 , a band in which @entity3 's flatmate @entity222 plays lead guitar			1
‘ we found we shared common interests in music , are both creative people and it was fun introducing her to all my friends , ’ admits @entity3 but he refuses to be drawn any further on his future with @entity172 until viewers watch their story later in the series			0
‘ i ’m only young so marriage and a family are something that is still way in the future for me but finding love , that ’s the medicine i need right now			0
' @entity3 appears in @entity32 , thursday at 9pm on @entity31			1
