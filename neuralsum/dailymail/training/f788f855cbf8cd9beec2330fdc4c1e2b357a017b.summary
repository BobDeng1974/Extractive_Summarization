@entity0 said : ' at one time i strived to get hair that was bone straight and now all i want is it big and poofy '			1
' when my hair is stretched out to its complete length and pressed , it goes down to my butt			0
but i do n't wear it like that because it looks weird			0
' the newly single care worker is proud of her unique style but usually ties her hair back when going on first dates , only revealing her secret later			0
' i did tell one guy and he was shocked and he googled me and was like ' oh , wow '			0

her jaw - dropping look brings her attention wherever she goes but it does have its drawbacks as she often gets it caught in trees , car doors and people 's earrings			0
it can also take two days to wash and dry and is so big she struggles to see clearly out from beneath it - which means she can not drive with her ' hair up '			1
to get her hair ready for a night out she shampoos it and then uses up to five conditioners			0
she then puts her hair into two @entity70 braids and from then it takes about two days to dry			1
but the positives far outweigh the negatives and she has become a hero in her hometown of @entity76 , @entity77			0
her biggest joy is inspiring young girls to stop using chemical straighteners , which can cause long - lasting damage to hair			2
hair washing has turned into a long - drawn out affair as it takes her two days to wash and dry it all in sections however , @entity0 is thrilled with the results and is keen to encourage other @entity89 - @entity88 to let their hair grow naturally she said : ' i do n't know why but there 's something very important to me about little girls appreciating my hair and then wanting to wear their hair the same			1
' i tell them there is nothing that i did special , there is no magical formula , we are born with our hair like this			0
' @entity0 was originally inspired by a picture of her mum @entity105 wearing an afro in the sixties - and she remains one of her biggest fans today			1
mrs @entity0 , 62 , who runs a care home , said : ' i 'm humbled by the fact she did this because she liked my natural hair , way before she was born			1
