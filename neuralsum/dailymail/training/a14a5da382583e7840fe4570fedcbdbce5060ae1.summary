author @entity0 says there is a pandemic of party rudeness that has gripped the nation the story about the parents of a five - year - old being sent a ‘ no show ’ invoice for £ 15.95 for failing to honour their word about their son ’s attendance at his friend ’s ‘ slide and ride ’ birthday party at a ski centre in @entity19 has hit the headlines			1
the bill senders ( the birthday boy 's parents ) are getting some flack for issuing the invoice in the first place – i agree , a tad weird and certainly not the correct thing – but i do applaud their courage			1
especially given the @entity30 family had replied officially confirming their son @entity31 ’s attendance but decided to go with , what will appear to the jilted hosts to be a ‘ better offer , ’ of a family day visiting relatives			1
supposedly no contact details were available for the hosts so the @entity30 ’s could n’t contact them to rescind @entity31 ’s attendance			1
as bizarre as this particular scenario may be , this family in @entity19 ( hardly the party - centre of the @entity44 , i admit ) is just one example of the pandemic of party rudeness that has gripped the nation			1
no one knows how to behave at parties anymore			1
times change , i get it			1
but when it comes to the world of entertaining there are some areas that i feel should be sacrosanct			1
as a regular host i can get quite worked up when i attend the events of others to see guests behaving in a fashion , which to my eyes , feels less than courteous			2
although it can be helpful for getting together large numbers of friends , it has its pitfalls - namely this magic third - option for soirées that mr @entity75 has invented : maybe attending			1
a guest is not ' maybe ' attending			1
you ’re either going , or you ’re not			2
if you are unsure if you can go but need to check , hold off clicking anything			2
some techno - babe once told me why people often click maybe attending			1
she said that invited guests would feel like they ’d offend the host by saying they were n’t coming			2
again , as a host , i know that not everyone can come to everything , but need to know final numbers so i know how many canapés to make			2
what would happen if all guests clicked maybe attending ? @entity30 was issued an invoice for £ 15.95 by a fellow parent after he failed to take @entity31 , pictured , to his classmate 's birthday party at a ski slope in @entity19 after saying he would be attending the pre-party some under 35s are now particularly guilty of initiating what we shall term a ‘ pre-party ’			1
this is where one of the guests decides to invite a select few to their house at the same time as the initial party for a ‘ warm up ’			1
not only does it somewhat upstage the original host , but also should the stealth gathering be discovered it could seriously damage friendships			2
at one party i attended , the host actually commented , after 50 minutes , as to the whereabouts of the 14 other guests			1
only me , the host ’s partner and two others had arrived on time			2
then , at 8.25pm , the remainder of the guests list arrived en masse with no explanation as to where they had all been or why they were all arriving together			2
if you do n't want to find yourself on the end of an unwanted invoice follow my top tips for being the perfect party guest ... 1			1
reply all invitations , whether through the post , online or in your child ’s satchel must be replied to within 2 - 3 days of receiving them			2
correct form is usually to reply to the invitation in the same way it was sent – so if your friend invites you by text , a text message back with your response is acceptable			2
attend if you say you are going – go ! even if you get a better offer you ca n’t back out			2
for most social parties you allow 10 - 15 minutes before showing up			0
thus , if the invitation says 7.30pm , you arrive at 7.40ish			0
bring something unless it is a very formal affair then it is now customary to bring a ‘ hostess gift ’ ( still called that if it ’s a single man hosting you )			0
never bring flowers that will need to be stuck in water upon arrival – you ’re just turning up with a job for your hosts			0
@entity160 yes , there may well be guests you do n’t find that stimulating , or ones who you could speak to all evening , but the objective at parties is to mix with as many people as possible			0
for dinners this is trickier as you are static for most of it , but for drinks or cocktail parties ensure you spend roughly no more than 10 - 12 minutes with as many guests as possible			0
@entity176 thank you ­ for good friends sending a text once you get home safely and to say a quick thank you is a nice touch , but is no substitute for something a little nicer and more tangible through the post			0
send your thank you letter or card within 36 hours of the party ’s end			1
time - keeping as we have seen , people can play fast and loose with the arrival time but so many people are oblivious to the ‘ 10 minutes late ’ rule - where you arrive just after the stated event time to give your host a bit of breathing time			0
when i explain this to those who do n’t understand it , they are unfailingly not hosts themselves , and therefore see no need for guests to give that safe breathing space to their hosts			0
a few weeks ago , 65 per cent of the guest list swanned into a housewarming a whole two hours late ! this only served in making those who had gone to the effort to arrive on cue feel like they ’d now be rude to leave			0
maybe this is the new form and it ’s just me ? if you say you ’re going to something you go for all of it , or none at all			0
mr @entity30 found a brown envelope containing this invoice in his son 's school bag snubbing as we have seen today with the party peril in @entity19 , sometimes we do get a better invitation to something or our plans and family circumstances change			1
but if we have already committed , then it is tough cheese and well done to the host for being organised and getting their invitations out first			0
if you ’ve said you ’re going … guess what … you ’re going ! only work or fatal illnesses are valid excuses in my book			1
and in those rare cases you send flowers and / or a hand - written missive to apologise			0
if two drinks parties are close by then it may be possible to attend both			0
even if it is just showing your face to ‘ make a cameo appearance ’			0
an acquaintance of mine committed to a party two months ago and failed to show , with no explanation sent to our host ( a mutual friend )			1
the morning after the night before , on @entity68 , a picture of her appeared at a bar with her friends … if you are going to be so rude as to snub , have a bit of intelligence about it			0
as a host , i worry about the details and how someone ’s actions , whether giving or receiving the hospitality , will affect others			0
clearly there is currently a rather inelegant acceptability as to what counts as ‘ correct form ’ when it comes to modern parties			0
people just do n’t seem to care anymore			0
for those who could n’t care less , do n’t bother inviting them			0
spend the money and effort on those who ‘ get it ’ and not those who presumptuously believe they ’re such good value at balls and bashes they ’ll be invited to the next one			0
