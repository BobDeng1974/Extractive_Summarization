by @entity0 a new @entity2 study has found the earlier women start to diet the more likely they are to suffer long - term health problems the earlier a woman starts to diet , the more prone she will be to health problems such as eating disorders and alcohol misuse , scientists have warned			1
a study at @entity14 followed 1,340 students for 10 years and found cultural pressures to stay thin affect women of all ages			1
some began to watch their weight and actively diet at the age of three , while others started to follow a calorie - controlled programme at the age of 26			0
researchers noted the earlier a woman started to diet , the more likely they were to suffer long - term health consquences			0
psychology professor @entity30 , who led the team , said : ' younger age of dieting predicts greater problems 10 years out from college			1
' she said it is not completely clear why dieting at an early age may have such an effect on health later in life			0
one possible reason was ' there is already something different ' about women who start dieting at an early age in terms of their social environment or genetic make - up			2
the findings , presented at the annual meeting of the @entity51 , revealed those factors can stay with a woman for life , increasing the risk of resorting to extreme dieting or other unhealthy behaviours later in life			0
eating disorders are often driven by social , psychological and biological factors , said professor @entity30			1
she said discouraging weight loss diets in young girls may reduce risk for eating , alcohol and weight - related problems in adulthood			2
public health initiatives should promote behaviours that increase wellness in girls such as increasing activity , decreasing leisure time watching tv and on computers and consuming more fruits and vegetables			0
such interventions could be necessary as early as primary school to support girls before they enter puberty - a time when their bodies will naturally experience rapid growth , weight gain and an increase in body fat			0
the @entity14 study found women were more prone to suffering eating disorders , obesity and alcohol misuse			1

study at @entity14 studied 1,340 *female* students for 10 years
found some women began dieting from as young as three
early dieting can leave women at risk of eating disorders and obesity
