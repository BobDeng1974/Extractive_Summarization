by @entity1 reporter published : 17:18 est , 14 february 2014 @entity3 : 19:49 est , 14 february 2014 @entity4 was used to making tough dives and dropping into dangerous territories as a @entity7 but his most harrowing mission came when he left a message for his boyfriend a former @entity7 has revealed how by accidentally ending a voicemail to his boyfriend by saying ' i love you ' led to the end of his military career			1
@entity4 was a part of the elite military unit nearly a decade before the ' @entity20 ' policy was lifted , allowing military servicemen and women to serve while being open about their sexuality			1
in 2002 , @entity4 had just returned from his second deployment and on the morning after his welcome home party , @entity4 called the fellow @entity7 serviceman who threw him the party			1
@entity4 left a voicemail thanking the man - who he had secretly been dating - and accidentally said ' i love you ' at the end of the message			1
when the man got home and listened to the message , a female colleague was in the room with him			0
that woman reported what she heard to her superior and it worked its way up the chain - of - command			2
' that was all it took for the @entity7 to launch a full - scale investigation that lasted for months , ' @entity4 told @entity48			1
at the end of the investigation , the @entity7 evidentally did n't like what they found because they pulled his security clearance and ' treated me like i was a criminal , ' @entity4 said			1
' it was one of the most difficult times of my life ... it was so damn humiliating , ' he told @entity48			0
on the outs : after a colleague of his boyfriend 's overheard a private message , she told her superiors and he became the subject of a months - long investigation the @entity7 honorably discharged @entity4 in 2003 and a spokesman would not comment on his allegations about the investigation			1
@entity4 recently penned an essay about his time in the @entity7 for @entity71 , a site dedicated to military news and stories that takes its name from the code for @entity77			2
he wrote how he reluctantly spun a web of lies to keep his brothers - in - arms from finding out about his social life			0
he recalled an instance when he got a call from a man named @entity85 who he had met the night before at a gay bar , and how he desperately wanted to see the man again but would have to come up with multiple excuses to keep it from his peers			0
' i absolutely hated it when i did that , ' he said of lying to the other seals in his company			0
' second , i was going to lie to @entity85 , because there is no way in hell i was going to tell him truthfully what i did and who i worked for			0
i ’m not proud of the lies , but living under the rule of @entity20 left me few options in such a small close - knit community			2
' support : @entity4 was honorably discharged in june 2003 but said that the majority of his fellow @entity7 were supportive of him during that difficult time mr @entity4 ' is not the first to go through such hurdles in order to keep two parts of his life - his sexuality and his service - separate from one another			1
the 2011 repeal of @entity20 made it legally safer for military servicemen and women to serve openly , but he said that the majority of the @entity7 from his company were supportive of him			2
' eventually , i was forced out of the closet to my seal team , and i discovered that it was not as bad as i had made it in my mind			0
sure , there were guys who would whisper and talk behind my back , but overall my @entity7 brothers supported me			0
for that , i will always be thankful , ' @entity4 wrote			0
' it was because of that support , from my brothers , that i could proudly say , “ my name is @entity4 , i am a @entity7 , and i am gay			2

a colleague of his boyfriend 's heard it and reported it , launching an investigation that *resulted* in @entity4 being discharged
