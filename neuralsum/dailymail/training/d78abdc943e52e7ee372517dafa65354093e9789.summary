by @entity0 published : 09:34 est , 29 april 2013 updated : 09:38 est , 29 april 2013 enjoying a a glass of wine could help prevent rheumatoid arthritis drinking alcohol in moderation could slash the risk of rheumatoid arthritis , according to new research			1
some regular drinkers were nearly half as likely to develop the crippling condition as teetotallers or those who rarely drank			2
researchers discovered the connection after carrying out an extensive review of previous studies that looked into the role of alcohol and rheumatoid arthritis			1
the results , published in the journal @entity21 , suggest a few drinks a week could have a protective effect against a disease that affects around 600,000 people in the @entity26			1
although the latest investigation did not look at the reasons why a regular tipple might offer some protection , earlier research suggested it could be because alcohol appears to dampen down inflammation in the body and also has a mild pain - killing effect			1
rheumatoid arthritis is triggered when the immune system , the body 's in - built defence mechanism , goes into action unnecessarily , attacking joints and sometimes other parts of the body			1
the reasons why remain a mystery but some evidence suggests exposure to mild infection may be enough to launch this over-reaction			2
as a result , joints become inflamed and swollen , causing pain or stiffness , and many sufferers also experience flu - like symptoms			0
in very severe cases , they can end up crippled and unable to live a full or active life			0
several small studies in recent years have hinted that drinking moderate amounts of alcohol could reduce the risks of developing the incurable condition			2
animal studies , for example , indicate mice are less likely to suffer arthritis if they have small amounts of alcohol added to their drinking water			2
rheumatoid arthritis is a crippling condition that causes extreme pain and in some cases deformity now researchers from @entity75 have carried out a meta - analysis , where data from earlier investigations are pooled to provide a more definitive answer			1
they gathered findings from nine different studies involving a total of nearly 12,000 patients			0
when they combined all the results they found that regular drinkers were 48 per cent less likely to be diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis			1
however , the benefits were confined to patients who tested positive for anti-citrulllinated protein antibodies			0
these are proteins that are released into the bloodstream when the disease in emerging and can often be detected before any symptoms appear			0
they affect around two - thirds of arthritis sufferers and their presence indicates a more severe form of the disease			0
patients who tested negative for the protein , which suggests they have a milder form of the disease , saw little or no benefit from regular drinking			0
in a report on their findings the researchers said : ' alcohol intake is inversely associated with @entity113 - positive rheumatoid arthritis , suggesting a protective effect			1
' but further research is needed to confirm this relationship			0

@entity26 review of studies found alcohol to have a protective effect against rheumatoid arthritis
condition affects around 600,000 @entity26 people
experts believe alcohol may have *anti-inflammatory* effect and also a mild *painkilling* effect
