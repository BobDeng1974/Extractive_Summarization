@entity0 pronounces himself to be ‘ a uniquely athletic boxer ’			1
@entity1 is perceived as a replica of his famously eccentric father			0
this saturday night in @entity7 ’s excel , their immediate futures will be mapped out			1
the massive @entity9 traveller and the muscular chip off the old @entity12 rock have sold out the 15,700 - seat arena in the @entity14			0
now both men need to take out equally ambitious rivals to move on to world title challenges			0
@entity1 and @entity18 at the weigh in ahead of the younger 's clash with @entity20 @entity0 , who said he was a ' a uniquely athletic boxer ’ , at the weigh in before his fight with @entity22 @entity0 , on the eve of his rematch with @entity22 from which the winner should be propelled into a mega-euros fight with @entity28 , has trained ‘ as never before ’			1
so hard in fact that he was able to weigh in fully clothed and still scale under 19 stones			0
@entity31 makes a sudden jump in class as he takes on @entity20 — but also a leap of faith that he will be the one to challenge the winner of next month ’s fight for the vacant @entity38 middleweight title between @entity39 and @entity41 ’s @entity40			1
the most extravagant boast before these @entity43 has come from @entity18 , who touts his son as greater already than the legendary @entity45 and more dangerous than any other boxer active today — @entity47 and @entity48 included			1
yet the claim which will intrigue the sports community most is @entity0 ’s depiction of himself as ‘ the most mobile , fluent , lithe , flexible and explosive athlete in the world ’			1
but even though 6ft 9in @entity0 is an incorrigible jester , he is deadly serious when he says : ‘ i am a one - off			1
i was born to be a sportsman			0
not only a fighter but a champion at any sport			2
’ @entity22 , who is eight inches shorter than his opponent , squares up to @entity0 at the @entity61 @entity20 ( right ) is the current @entity62 , @entity63 and @entity64 middleweight champion most importantly , he points out : ‘ the biggest key is my legs			1
they are the legs of a racehorse			0
not the legs of a carthorse like most fighters who are built squat for power			0
’ by chance , i can confirm that he is unexpectedly agile when he wants to get in shape			2
one day at his old training camp in @entity77 he said ‘ watch this ’ and vaulted acrobatically from the floor , above the ring apron and over the ropes to land lightly on his feet in the ring			2
it was a startling sight			0
@entity0 suspects that the mighty @entity85 is already aware of his physical prowess ‘ and may not agree to fight me next year even though i will be his mandatory challenger ’			1
@entity85 had a close - up view of one of the very few heavyweights taller than himself when @entity0 worked out at @entity28 ’s and his brother @entity92 ’s training camp in the @entity94			1
@entity0 says : ‘ he watched me train — but showed no inclination to spar with me			1
in a way i ’m glad because if we do meet he wo n’t have the learning experience of us trading punches			0
’ @entity1 has considerably less professional and amateur experience than his opponent @entity0 claimed that his biggest assets are his legs , which he said were the legs of a racehorse @entity31 , on the contrary , is built for the strength which he hopes will counter @entity20 ’ considerably deeper amateur and professional experience			1
@entity20 is defending his @entity63 , @entity62 and @entity64 middleweight titles			1
as the champion , he is favourite			0
but it is not forgotten in the @entity31 household that this month sees the anniversary — the 24th — of the dramatic night when @entity118 , then a comparative novice , overturned the odds with that historic upset of @entity122			0
and of the two big fights at the @entity125 , this appears the harder to call			1
‘ fifty - fifty , ’ plead many when asked to predict the outcome			0
so it will be if @entity20 allows his visibly seething anger at the deliberately provocative behaviour of the opposing camp to draw him into a slugging match			2
the @entity132 are calculating on a knockout if the fight turns into machismo exchanges of heavy punches			0
@entity1 and @entity20 looks set to overshadow the main event between @entity0 and @entity22 @entity0 throws a big right hand at @entity139 during their first fight at @entity142 in 2011 but if @entity20 keeps his temper and sticks to his boxing skills , he should edge a 12 - round decision			1
@entity0 , for his part , argues with conviction that in his current chiselled and athletic condition he will beat @entity22 more easily than he did when they first met three years ago			1
@entity22 , however , has rededicated himself since that defeat , taken @entity85 the distance and now scales 18lb lighter than he did three years ago at 17st 3½lb			2
it will be no surprise if both men are knocked down at various stages of the fight but @entity0 has a consistent record of getting up after being decked — and appears to hit the harder			2
it would be no great shock , either , if this one went the full 12 rounds scheduled for @entity22 ’s @entity63 title defence			2
although that is not my expectation			0
fury should get the job done , even it is later rather than sooner			0
@entity168 ’s predictions : @entity20 beats @entity31 on points			2
@entity171 : live on @entity172 from 7pm and @entity173 .			0

@entity0 will face @entity22 at @entity125 on saturday night
@entity176 will face @entity64 champion @entity20
@entity0 recently boasted he was ' a uniquely athletic boxer ’
@entity18 claimed his son was better than legend @entity45
