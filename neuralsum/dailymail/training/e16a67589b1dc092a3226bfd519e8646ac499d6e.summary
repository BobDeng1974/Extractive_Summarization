@entity1 's notoriously windy weather almost got the better of the @entity2 as she arrived at @entity3 for the @entity5 's coronation celebrations			1
sporting a stunning white lace dress with a scalloped hem by favourite designer , @entity9 , and a beautiful white picture hat by milliner , @entity11 , the @entity2 looked elegant , although she struggled to keep her headgear in place			1
but despite the unhelpful breeze , the wife of @entity15 looked in good spirits as she made her way into the cathedral alongside her cheerfully grinning husband			0
their five - year - old son , @entity33 , was not at the @entity3 but the rest of the the senior royals and crowned heads from all over @entity38 did make an appearance			0
like the @entity2 , both the @entity24 and the @entity40 plumped for pale , summery shades as did princess @entity42			0
@entity5 , too , wore a suit made from ivory jacquard - the same colour in which she was crowned 53 years ago , as did her daughter , @entity48			0
two who chose more formal , dark colours were the princesses , @entity31 and @entity32 , who looked elegant in navy blue and teal dresses			1
stylish : the @entity2 has reinvented herself in recent years and is now one of the most fashionable royals excited : @entity56 looked thrilled to be at the @entity3 and sat between her parents for the third time this year , @entity2 appeared in a hat by milliner , @entity11 ( pictured right )			1
for the @entity67 memorial service , for the royal family 's trip to church on @entity64 and now for the coronation celebrations at @entity3 , the @entity2 chose creations by the @entity70 - based milliner , who has been designing for just five years			2
so just who is @entity11 ? first launched in 2008 , the designer began by creating one - off pieces for friends attending events such as the @entity76 and @entity77 , but demand for the pieces quickly snowballed			0
five years on , the designer now creates bespoke hats for a veritable who 's who of royal and jetset clients , as well as releasing three ready - to - wear collections per year			0
in addition to the @entity2 , other famous clients include the @entity24 , @entity89 , @entity32 and princess @entity90 , the glamorous @entity93 wife of the @entity96 country 's crown prince @entity94			2
celebration : the @entity5 stole the show as she made her way into the @entity3 in an elegant ivory coat flattering : prince @entity102 's daughters , @entity31 and @entity32 , chose more sober hues of teal and navy colourful : @entity89 accompanied her husband @entity107 into the cathedral wearing a bright yellow dress pretty : both @entity48 and her daughter - in - law , @entity110 , chose a gorgeous powder pink hue pale and interesting : princess @entity42 chose a chic eau de nil suit for her appearance at the @entity3 anniversary : it is 60 years since the @entity5 was crowned at @entity3 on 2nd june 1953 chic : both the @entity40 and the @entity24 plumped for pale hues and big hats			1
