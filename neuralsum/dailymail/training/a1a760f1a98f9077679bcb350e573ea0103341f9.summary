by @entity1 reporter published : 12:40 est , 15 january 2013 updated : 12:40 est , 15 january 2013 a high school in @entity3 is planning to tackle underage binge drinking at dances by breathalyzing students at the door			1
@entity8 will test pupils for alcohol consumption before every school dance , perhaps as soon as the next event on february 9			2
the school has experienced problems with drinking before , such as an event in 2005 where 12 students were suspended , but it is now taking a direct approach			1
testing times : @entity8 is planning to breathalyze students at the door to school dances dr. @entity23 , the school 's interim superintendent , told @entity25 , that : ' there have been problems in the past , as in most suburbs – students who binge in the parking lot and come in looking perfectly normal , but half an hour later , blotto			1
' ' we even had one incident where a student threw up on the shoes of the principal ’s wife , ' @entity23 added			0
the superintendent told @entity38 that @entity40 police officers will meet students at the entrance to the prom with breathalysers			1
but @entity23 also says that the planning for the new regime is still at an early stage and it is not yet decided if the school will test every student , or just the ones that seem intoxicated			0
secret binge drinking is problem at many high schools the school is currently working with police and the local attorney 's office to plan the new measures , while the school committee will have the final say			2
' i ’m not holding to a particular schedule , ' @entity23 told @entity25			0
' it depends on how confident we are that it is appropriate , and whether civil liberties are protected , and we ’ve exercised due diligence			0
' during a @entity72 ' dance in 2005 , a number of severely intoxicated students were taken to local hospitals due to alcohol poisoning			2
the event was cancelled and 12 students were suspended			1
since then @entity8 has tried a number of measures to crack down on drunkenness at school functions			0
at a @entity83 - themed dance at @entity8 numerous students were taken to hospital for intoxication and 12 were suspended the school has vastly reduced the number and the length of official dances			1
and in 2008 @entity40 introduced a ' promenade ' event before attendees went to the prom			0
during the promenade , students are made to walk down the aisle of the auditorium with their dates in front of the whole school community , as well as family and friends			0
but it seems that students are still turning up drunk at dances and the school has now called in breathalyzers and the police for assistance			1
according to @entity113 , this practice already takes place at schools in other @entity3 cities and towns			0
@entity8 is n't yet sure whether they will breathalyze all students or just the ones who appear intoxicated			2

following a prom in 2005 , 12 students at @entity8 in @entity3 were suspended for intoxication
@entity8 has tried to cut down on underage drinking since but now is turning to police officers with breathalyzers
