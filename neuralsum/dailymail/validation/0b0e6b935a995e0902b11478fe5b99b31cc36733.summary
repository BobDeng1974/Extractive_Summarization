a new injectable drug designed to eliminate double chins without surgery was unanimously recommended for approval by a @entity5 advisory committee this week			1
the drug , currently known as @entity7 , now only needs to receive final @entity5 approval before it becomes available to the public			1
unlike current double chin surgeries , which require doctors to ' cut it out or suck it out , ' @entity7 will be a ' noninvasive , in - the - office procedure , ' according to dr. @entity15			1
this causes the fat cell to burst , destroying it permanently			2
side - effects include short - term swelling , bruising and numbness @entity15 , a dermatologist who has been working with @entity7 - 101 since 2007 , said many people have fat underneath the chin , even if ' they 're not fat in the rest of their body ' , she told @entity39			1
to insert the drug , @entity15 marks the area where she sees the ' max amount of fat ' with a grid of tiny dots , which act as the injection sites for the @entity7			1
@entity15 says the procedure only takes about five minutes and patients heal in two to three days - and do n't even need to wear a bandage			1
the drug is a formulation of deoxycholic acid , a ' naturally occurring molecule ' that helps our bodies break down the fat we receive from food , according to manufacturer @entity58			2
dr. @entity59 , who presented @entity7 - 101 to the @entity5 , said the drug destroys the membrane of the fat cells underneath the double chin			1
the @entity7 - 101 treatment only takes five minutes to administer and two to three days to heal this causes the fat cell to burst			1
its remains are naturally absorbed back into the body , while the cell is destroyed permanently			0
as with any drug , there are side effects			1
they include short - lasting swelling , bruising and numbness that was found to be ' mild to moderate ' , according to dermatologist @entity77			1
@entity79 pain at the site of the injections was also reported			0
@entity77 noted in the trials that the intensity of the side effects decreased with each additional treatment session , he told @entity87			2
although the drug reaches its maximum desired effect if the patient undergoes six treatments spaced a month apart , @entity77 said he does not believe ' most patients ' will require that many			0
@entity77 said @entity7 could be a game - changer in terms of what dermatologists can do when patients are worried about their neck			2
' we 've been accustomed to addressing patient aesthetic concerns primarily from the chin up , ' he told @entity87			0
' however , the neck ... is critical in framing the lower half of the face and creating our profile			0
changes in the neck as we age or gain weight can have profound effect on our self - esteem			0
' the drug is a formulation of deoxycholic acid , a ' naturally occurring molecule ' that helps our bodies break down the fat we receive from food , according to manufacturer @entity58 dr. @entity120 , president of the @entity121 , said not everyone is a good candidate for the drug			0
he told @entity124 he worries that , after @entity126 is approved , people will use the drug to try and fix larger areas of fat			0
but according to @entity15 , the drug is ' not a weight loss treatment ' and needs to be administered properly so that patients get a ' very even reduction of fat			2
' she warns that physicians must ' understand the anatomy ' of the area underneath the chin , which houses delicate nerves that should not be touched			0
@entity141 recommends patients only receive the procedure from trained ' board certified experts '			0
@entity7 has been tested in 19 clinical studies with 2,600 patients			2
it will not be covered by insurance and the approximate cost is not yet known .			0

@entity7 is a noninvasive , in - office procedure that takes five minutes

patients heal in 2 - 3 days and can walk out without wearing a bandage
