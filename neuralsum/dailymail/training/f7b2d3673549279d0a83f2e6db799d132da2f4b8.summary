by @entity0 and @entity1 last updated at 12:57 am on 14th december 2011 one of the men accused of murdering @entity4 was secretly filmed telling friends he wanted to torture and kill black people , the @entity2 heard yesterday			1
in an appalling racist rant recorded by a police surveillance camera , @entity4 boasted he would use ‘ two sub-machine guns ’ in a plan to ‘ skin a black * * * * ’ and ‘ blow their two arms and legs off ’			1
then , he said , he would tell them : ‘ go on , you can swim home now ’			2
he added : ‘ they would be bobbing about like that			2
’ suspects : @entity4 , left , and @entity4 both deny murder @entity4 , 35 , and @entity4 , 36 , are alleged to have fatally stabbed 18 - year - old @entity4 , an a-level student , in @entity23 , @entity24 , in april 1993			1
twenty months later , in december 1994 , police installed a covert camera inside @entity4 ’s rented flat in @entity27 , @entity23			1
over a period of 17 days , detectives heard @entity4 frequently use racist terms to describe black and @entity34 people , jurors were told			1
@entity4 was seen in one video clip recalling a time when he threatened a black colleague with a knife			1
a brawl started between the pair when @entity4 stole his baseball cap , and he later threatened the colleague with a @entity44 knife			1
@entity4 said on the video : ‘ i said , “ tap me once more , you silly * * * * , i ’m going to slice this down you seven times ”			1
’ he was also seen wandering around the flat with a large knife , and telling another man who is not on trial , @entity53 , that a ‘ @entity55 ’ had won the lottery jackpot			2
on one occasion , @entity53 was seen to hide a knife in his jacket before leaving the flat with @entity62 jurors were shown a series of clips from the surveillance video , the trial judge mr @entity56 warned they might find the material distressing			2
‘ the material you will be watching shows the behaviour the prosecution alleges is racist and violent but you will have to be the judges of what it shows , ’ he told them			1
‘ you may well find it shocking			0
if you do , you must remember that emotion has no part to play in this trial			0
’ the black and white sequences were shot over a number of days on a tiny camera installed low in the front room of the flat , close to the television			0
murdered : black teenager @entity4 who was stabbed to death in april 1992 the conversations between @entity4 , @entity4 and @entity87 were heard with programmes such as @entity89 , @entity90 and gladiators in the background			1
@entity4 was stabbed to death in @entity94 , @entity23 , shortly after 10.30pm on april 22 1993 , after being attacked by a gang of white youths who had shouted racist abuse			1
detectives asked @entity4 about his grey bomber jacket which prosecutors say is now at the heart of the case			1
@entity4 said : ‘ neither me or my jacket was out that night , the night of the murder			1
’ he went on : ‘ stabbing innocent people is not something we get off on , it ’s not something we enjoy doing			0
’ the court has previously heard that brothers @entity53 and @entity113 were suspects in the original investigation and items of clothing were seized from their family home in @entity23 during a police search			2
@entity4 and @entity4 were charged after a forensic breakthrough during a review of the case in 2007 and 2008			1
prosecutors claim that 16 fibres linked to the clothes @entity4 wore on the night of his death were found on @entity4 ’s jacket and a multi-coloured cardigan , or in the evidence bags they were kept @entity130 also found a tiny blood stain on the collar of his jacket and a fragment of blood which encased two fibres			1
defence lawyers claim that neither @entity4 nor @entity4 was at the scene at the time of the killing and have suggested forensic evidence has been contaminated			1
at the time of the killing @entity4 was living in @entity23 , and @entity4 lived three miles away in @entity143			1
@entity4 later rented the flat in @entity27 with a friend			1
@entity4 and @entity4 deny murder			1
they were separated by nearly two decades – the foul - mouthed teenager with a knife in his hand , and the sober - suited , quietly spoken man in the witness box			0
one was @entity4 aged 19 , filmed on a secret police camera the year after @entity4 was stabbed to death			1
the other was @entity4 aged 36 , facing a murder charge 17 years later			1
yesterday an @entity2 jury saw both of them – first when the 1994 video recording turned the clock back to the time when he and his associates were suspects ; then when he took the witness stand to deny any involvement in killing the 18 - year - old black student			0
for the first time in this marathon trial , jurors witnessed the venom and racial hatred that was captured by a covert camera set up in @entity4 ’s rented flat			1
his friend @entity4 , now his co-defendant , was heard bragging that he wanted to torture and kill black people			1
@entity4 and one of his friends were seen holding large knives			2
but yesterday @entity4 , sitting just yards from @entity4 ’s parents in court , said he was ‘ disgusted and embarrassed ’ by the racist language he was heard using on the covert film			1
he conceded there was ‘ no denying ’ he held racist views at the time it was made , but he added : ‘ i do n’t dislike people because of the colour of their skin			2
’ he said he had black , @entity34 and @entity192 friends			0
the stark contrast between the 1994 film and the figure in the witness box came on the first day of the defence case after nearly a month of prosecution evidence			0
it was the first time the court has heard either defendant speak , save for answering to their names on day one – the first time , too , that either has been out of the dock			2
earlier @entity4 had sat in silence as the film was played to the court			1
now he adjusted his striped blue tie , pulled down the waistcoat of his three - piece suit and sat facing the eight men and four women jurors			0
above him , in the public gallery , his mother and relatives watched			0
a dark - haired woman was in tears			0
asked by his counsel @entity218 how he felt as he watched the film , @entity4 replied : ‘ to be honest with you , i ’m not comfortable sitting there watching it			2
it ’s the first time i ’ve seen it in 15 years			0
it ’s not something i ’m proud of			0
it ’s certainly not the way i was brought up to speak either			0
’ when he was filmed talking to his friend @entity53 about threatening to ‘ slice ’ a black workmate with a @entity44 knife , it was ‘ just a bit of bravado ’ , he said			2
‘ i think i was just talking up the situation and relating it to my friends			0
just being a bit stupid			0
’ why did the surveillance film at his flat show him at one stage with a knife in his hand ? ‘ i ca n’t quite recall , but watching the video , i ’d been cleaning and tidying up and everything else			0
there ’s a chance i was making dinner at that time			0
’ what did he feel about being heard to call someone a @entity253 ? ‘ it ’s not right , ’ he said			0
‘ i ca n’t defend it			0
i ca n’t justify it			0
’ he would ‘ definitely not ’ have used that sort of language in front of his parents , he said			2
and calling someone on tv a n * * * * * ? ‘ i suppose you could call it idiotic banter , ’ he said , ‘			0
for the amusement of my friends sitting there with me			0
it was just a rude and stupid conversation			0
’ @entity4 was adamant he was at home with his parents on the night of april 22 , 1993 , when @entity4 was attacked by a gang of white youths at around 10.30pm			2
@entity4 had been in his bedroom listening to music and playing computer games , he told the jury			1
the only time he went out was some time around 11.30pm , when he called at the home of his friends @entity53 and @entity113 , who , the court has been told , later became suspects in the police investigation			2
he went to borrow a @entity284 cd and ask if they had a joint for him to smoke			0
was n’t that rather late to be making a social call , his barrister asked ? ‘ it was , ’ he agreed			0
‘ but at that age in life , for me and all my group of friends , it was n’t too unusual to be going round late at night			0
’ mr @entity294 asked him : ‘ did you have anything to do with the events that led to the death of @entity4 ? ‘ no , ’ @entity4 replied			2

@entity4 told court he was ' embarrassed ' by secretly filmed racist language
