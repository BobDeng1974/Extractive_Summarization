he is now a partner at @entity52 , a security and intelligence consultancy			0
the @entity29 ( @entity29 ) was created in 2003 when the @entity6 was founded			0

' we must not become complacent , ' he wrote @entity81 , an accomplished security expert , runs the @entity29			0
he has managed security operations in the @entity83 , and was also an explosive ordnance disposal officer but little is known about what role obp actually plays in attempting to prevent bombings at public events that could be considered target - rich environments @entity81 has headed the office since august 2012			0
he has lengthy security management experience with a defense contractor , in the @entity83 , and as an explosive ordnance disposal officer			2
on february 26 the @entity1 @entity13 issued a lengthy @entity78 for countering @entity10			1
@entity1 wrote in an introduction to that document that ' we have no greater responsibility than providing for the safety and security for [ sic ] our citizens , allies , and partners ... the use of improvised explosive devices ( @entity10 ) threatens these interests by killing , injuring , and intimidating citizens and political leaders around the world			1
' ' we must not become complacent , ' he wrote			0
the policy document included statements about ' enhancing our focus on protecting @entity12 lives ' and ' screening , detecting , and protecting our people , facilities , transportation systems , [ and ] critical infrastructure			0

' president @entity7 ( @entity128 ) created the @entity6 in 2003 as part of a broad response to the sept. 11 , 2001 attacks on the @entity133 towers and the @entity44			1
former @entity135 governor @entity134 ( r ) was the cabinet - level agency 's first secretary @entity13 principal deputy press secretary @entity137 did n't respond to a question about whether there were any failures in the president 's @entity78 for countering @entity10 , or whether it was too soon to judge the february 2013 policy 's effectiveness			1

@entity137 also did n't respond to a question about how much money @entity1 's current budget proposal , delivered to @entity154 on april 10 , allocates for domestic prevention of terrorist bombing attacks on @entity12 soil			1
but the february @entity13 policy document acknowledged that ' the threat from ied use is likely to remain high in the coming decade and will continue to evolve in response to our abilities to counter them			2
' ' a whole - of - government approach ... will best position the @entity12 to discover plots to use ieds in the @entity12 , or against @entity12 persons abroad , before those threats become imminent			0

$ 20 million budget under @entity7 became $ 11 million under @entity1
both administrations neglected domestic bombing prevention , *devoting* a tiny *fraction* of the $ 1 billion *earmarked* for @entity10 prevention overseas
@entity1 issued a lengthy ' @entity78 for countering @entity10 ' in february but a *spokesman* wo n't say if it failed
