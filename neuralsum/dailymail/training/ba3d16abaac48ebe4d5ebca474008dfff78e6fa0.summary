by @entity0 murdered : a painting of teenager @entity2 , apparently showing blood coming from her head , has been covered up by art exhibition organisers after the girl 's mother called it ' sick and disgusting ' controversial paintings of a schoolboy and his ex-girlfriend , who he murdered for a bet , have had to be covered up at an art exhibition after the victim 's mother described them as ' sick and disgusting '			1
@entity16 , 50 , protested after pictures of her daughter 's teenage killer @entity20 went on display at an arts and culture festival in @entity24			1
another of the images at the festival appeared to show @entity16 's 15 - year - old daughter @entity28 with blood coming from her head			1
the pictures , which have been covered up with white sheets , were on show only 10 miles from the spot where @entity20 bludgeoned @entity28 to death with a rock in october 2010			1
@entity20 , now 17 , was jailed last year after a court heard that he carried out the brutal killing for a bet with a schoolmate to win a full @entity42 breakfast			2
the paintings , by artist @entity43 , went on display at the @entity48 arts and culture festival in @entity49 , @entity50 of @entity51			1
organisers initially resisted calls to cover them up , saying they were ' not in the business of censorship ' , but they relented after mrs @entity16 complained			1
mrs @entity16 said : ' i feel like throwing a pot of red paint over them			2
' it ’s sick and disgusting that a painting like this can go on show so soon after my daughter was murdered			0
' some of @entity28 ’s school friends were due to go to the exhibition - they would have been in tears if they had seen this vile picture			2
' blocked out : the controversial pictures by @entity43 have been covered following anger at his subject matter sick : the exhibition - titled people i know , people i used to know and people i 'd rather not know - features paintings of murdered school girl @entity2 @entity77 had broken up with @entity28 but later lured her to woodland near his home in the village of @entity80 , @entity81			1
he used a rock the size of a rugby ball to kill her then went home as if nothing had happened			0
@entity28 ’s body as found the next day after mrs @entity16 reported her missing			1
advice : a notice at the art festival warns visitors of the content of the exhibition			0
organisers have decided to cover the controversial paintings the artist used @entity20 's police mugshot to create one of the controversial paintings			1
he said it was a ' crime of passion ' by a tortured young man driven mad by his girlfriend ’s rejection and unrequited love			0
and he wrote ' @entity105 ' on @entity20 ’s forehead - the @entity108 word for ' love ' or ' darling '			0
but the murder trial heard @entity20 had a ' deep - seated hatred ' of @entity28 and had boasted to friends that he was plotting different ways to kill her			2
mrs @entity16 , of @entity115 , @entity116 , accused the artist of ignoring the facts			1
she said : ' what right has he got to say things like that because it is not true			0
anger : killer @entity20 smiles as he arrives at court during his trial , left , and @entity16 , centre right , mother of tragic teen @entity2 with her young son @entity130 and teenage daughter @entity128 ' it was heard in court - this was not a crime of passion it was premeditated murder			1
' if the artist had said evil on @entity20 ’s forehead then maybe i could have accepted it			0
' but " @entity105 " - that is totally wrong			0
' the @entity16 family 's local mp , @entity145 , said : ' the original decision to exhibit these paintings has caused deep distress , and should not have happened at all			2
' this has shown immense insensitivity and bad judgement dealing with a matter that is not only local but very recent and very vivid , not least for the families involved			0
' the decision late in the day to cover these pictures from public view will be of scant consolation to those affected , knowing they have been on display for several days			0
' the paintings form part of a series of works called ' people i know ; people i used to know ; and people i ’d rather not know '			0
@entity169 organisers said they were not aware of the identities of those in the paintings when the submission was received or when they were independently selected for the open exhibition at this year ’s gallery .			0
