they have been known for decades as ‘ @entity1 ’ after the upmarket @entity3 borough in which their well - heeled 4x4 owners drive them			1
but now the title of ‘ @entity10 ’ capital of @entity9 has moved decidedly @entity11 - to oil - rich and rather royal @entity12 in @entity13 , toppling the trendy suburb from its claim to fame as the postcode with the most off - roaders			2
@entity1 ’s @entity20 post-code has traditionally topped @entity9 ’s 4x4 league table - despite the fact that the rugged vehicles are more likely to be seen on the school - run or outside a trendy restaurant than ever actually venturing off - road into a muddy field			1
@entity28 drives a @entity29 , a vehicle that has been given the name ' @entity1 tractor ' in recent years because of its popularity with rich people in urban areas but now having lost its crown to @entity13 , it also has fewer than neighbouring @entity38 and @entity39			1
the relegation coincides with five years of soaring 4x4 sales that has seen annual registrations almost double across the country			0
farmers are still the drivers most likely to own one but the list of top ten buyers is now dominated by property developers , landlords , company directors , finance chiefs and bankers			0

one in four drivers in @entity59 near @entity60 now own and operate a @entity29 , or other type of 4x4 one of the estates in the affluent area of @entity59 near @entity60			1
the 4x4 has become popular for those rich enough to own them who want to drive around @entity13 country lanes the top ten is made up of well - heeled @entity3 boroughs , affluent parts of @entity12 and the @entity71			1
indeed @entity12 takes up four of the top ten places , including first place			0
one in four drivers has one in the table - topping market town of @entity59 , which is just 20 miles from @entity13 ’s @entity77 oil capital @entity60 and is famed as the gateway to @entity79			1
it pips the @entity3 ’s upmarket @entity20 post-code of @entity38 and @entity39 at 23 per cent - almost on a par with the third place @entity83 of @entity85 , which is also in @entity12			0
fourth place is @entity3 ’s fashionable @entity89 postcode of @entity38 and @entity90 ( 23 per cent ) which pips @entity1 ’s @entity20 into 5th place ( 22 per cent ) and @entity92 in @entity93 ( @entity94 ) into sixth position ( 22 per cent )			2
some of the £ 1 million - plus houses that reside in the @entity3 borough of @entity1			2
many of the residents of these sorts of urban areas use @entity29 and other 4x4s as a sign of wealth , given their expensive price tag colourful terraced houses , @entity107 , @entity1 , @entity108 , where the stats for those owning 4x4s has dropped significantly the statistics based on more than three million policyholders revealed that those with children are more than twice as likely to buy one			1

@entity29 makes the three most popular models with its @entity122 top followed by the @entity123 and @entity124			2
the current popularity of 4x4s marks an astonishing turnaround since the mid-noughties when sales plunged after vehicle excise duty on the most polluting cars was doubled			0
the slump followed protests by environmentalists over carbon dioxide emissions from ‘ gas guzzlers ’ that halted production at @entity29 ’s factory in @entity139 in may 2005			0
manufacturers claim fuel efficiency of new 4x4s has improved by 37 per cent in the past seven years and many cost less than a hatchback			2
the @entity146 ( @entity146 ) said sales of ‘ dual purpose vehicles ’ - a category of mostly 4x4s - have nearly doubled from 132,472 in 2009 to 248,003 last year			0
