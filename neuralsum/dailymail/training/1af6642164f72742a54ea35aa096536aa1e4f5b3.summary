a quarter of teachers and a third of police have now been dragged into the 40p tax rate , it emerged last night			1
and one in ten nurses are paying the higher rate of income tax , showing that the 40p band once aimed at the rich is now the ‘ norm ’ for hundreds of thousands of workers who would not consider themselves wealthy			1
over the past decade more than 1.6million employees have started to pay the higher rate , which kicks in when wages exceed £ 41,865 a year			1
the revelation will pile pressure on @entity30 to use next year ’s @entity32 manifesto to pledge to raise the threshold in line with rising incomes			0

the figures from the @entity40 reveal that 120,000 teachers , 70,000 police officers and up to 72,000 nurses have been pulled into the 40p band			1

who is arguing for lower taxes now ? ’ the @entity68 says that one in three workers will be higher rate taxpayers within two decades			1
more than ten million will have been dragged over the higher rate threshold by 2033 , twice as many as at present			1
in april , chancellor @entity72 used his budget to increase the tax - free personal allowance from £ 10,000 to £ 10,500 , a change that the @entity23 says benefits all workers earning up to £ 100,000			1
but calls to raise the threshold for the 40p rate in line with rising incomes were ignored			0
according to the @entity40 , the number of ‘ teaching professionals ’ paying the higher rate has trebled , rising from 100,000 to more than 300,000 in the past decade			2
they now include 87,000 secondary teachers and 34,000 primary teachers			0
