every january , the technology world treks to @entity1 to see the technology set to invade our lives in the year ahead			0
however , this year @entity5 delivered its latest hi - tech innovation in a unique way			0
the @entity9 car maker sent its self driving car on a 550 - mile ( 885km ) journey from @entity12 to @entity1			1
' we 're demonstrating our leading role in the area of self - driving cars , ’ said technical development director professor dr @entity23 the concept relieves the driver of driving duties from 0 to 70 mph , or just over 110 km / h , with a ' piloted mode ' the @entity28 piloted driving concept utilizes the latest technologically advanced systems developed by @entity5			1
the concept relieves the driver of driving duties from 0 to 70 mph , or just over 110 km / h. the car , that has been affectionately been named ' @entity33 ' by the development team , can initiate lane changes and passing manoeuvres			1
in addition , the @entity28 piloted driving concept accelerates and brakes independently			1
before the piloted driving system reaches its limitations , in city environments for example , the driver is requested to take control of the vehicle to ensure proper safety			1
the @entity9 auto - giant calls its self - driving technology ‘ @entity53 ’ , and insists the sensors and equipment demonstrated in the vehicle are ‘ production ready ’			0
as a result , the company claims it is on course to put driverless cars into commercial production as soon as next year			0
elsewhere , to highlight the growing importance of self - driving cars , @entity5 sent an automated @entity28 ‘ supercar ’ on a 550 - mile ( 885km ) journey from @entity12 to @entity1 to prove the driverless car could soon be a reality on the world ’s motorways			1
self - parking cars are already in production and widely available , however the next generation of vehicles promise to carry their passengers on long journeys without incident or accident			0
' at more than 550 miles of piloted highway driving with journalists behind the wheel , @entity5 is demonstrating the era of automated driving is nearly here , ' the firm says			0
the long - distance test drive of the @entity28 piloted driving concept car will show that unprecedented performance can be achieved with series production technology			1
the drive will take place from @entity88 , @entity18 to @entity1 , @entity89 to attend the @entity90 2015 ( @entity90 ) , one of the world ’s most important electronics trade shows			0
„ ' the test drive from the west coast of @entity18 to @entity1 demonstrates our leadership role in piloted driving ' , said prof. dr. @entity23 , @entity98 and @entity99			0
before the piloted driving system reaches its limitations , in city environments for example , the driver is requested to take control of the vehicle to ensure proper safety			1
the car , that has been affectionately been named ' @entity33 ' by the development team , can initiate lane changes and passing manoeuvres			1

in addition , the @entity28 piloted driving concept accelerates and brakes independently			1
before initiating a lane change to the left or the right , the vehicle adapts its speed to surrounding vehicles			1
if the speed and distance calculation is deemed safe , the vehicle initiates the lane change with precision and in a timely manner			1
the piloted concept vehicle utilizes a combination of various sensors , many of which are close to production ready			1
a new hi - resolution 3d video camera , already integrated into the next generation systems found in the new @entity140 , takes a wide - angle view out in front of the vehicle			2
four small front and rear mounted cameras view closer surroundings			0
navigation data is used for basic vehicle orientation			0
the long range radar sensors of the adaptive cruise control ( @entity151 ) and the @entity5 side assist ( @entity153 ) keep watch of the front and rear of the vehicle			0
two mid-range radar sensors at the front and rear respectively are aimed to the right and left to complete the 360 degree view			0
laser scanners are mounted within the @entity164 grille and the rear bumper skirt			0
the scanners deliver redundant information to provide detailed recognition of static and dynamic objets during piloted driving			0
the technologies are production ready including their vehicle integration and cost structure for vehicle production in the near future			0
last year @entity5 showed off the @entity177 piloted driving concept completing a lap on the @entity181 track in @entity182 – at racing speed , without a driver			1
before the piloted driving system reaches its limitations , in city environments for example , the driver is requested to take control of the vehicle to ensure proper safety			2
a trained @entity5 professional test driver will accompany the media from the passenger seat for added safety			2
last year the @entity9 car giant let the car show off its at skills at top speed for the first time			2
the @entity177 piloted driving concept completed a lap on the @entity181 track in @entity182 – at racing speed , without a driver			1
@entity5 scored yet another major success in the development of piloted driving : before the season finale of the @entity210 ( @entity210 ) , the latest technology pioneer was running up to its physical limit , with no driver			1
it took the @entity177 piloted driving concept just slightly over two minutes to complete a lap on the @entity181 track in @entity182 – piloted with high precision and accuracy to within centimeters			2
' the top performance by the @entity5 rs 7 today substantiates the skills of our development team with regard to piloted driving at @entity5 , ' said prof. dr. @entity23 , @entity224 at @entity5 ' the derivations from series production , particularly in terms of precision and performance , are of great value for our further development steps			1
' for orientation on the track , the technology pioneer uses specially corrected gps signals			0
the car has no driver - and is driven entirely by software			1
for orientation on the track , the car uses specially corrected gps signals			2
this gps data is transmitted to the vehicle via @entity243 according to the automotive standard and redundantly via high - frequency radio			0
in parallel to this , 3d cameras in the car film the track , and a computer program compares the cameras ' image information against a data set stored on board			2
this is what makes it possible for the technology pioneer to orient itself on the track within centimeters - and decide on the perfect race line			0

piloted driving is one of the most important development fields at @entity5 : the first successful developments were achieved ten years ago			2
the test results continually flow into series development			2
the latest test runs at the physical limit are providing the @entity5 engineers with insights for the development of automatic avoidance functions in critical driving situations , for @entity287 assistance systems from @entity5 are already making driving more relaxed and better controlled			2
these systems ' highest level of development can be experienced in the updated @entity291 * and @entity293 * model series .			0

concept car takes over at speeds from 0 to 70 mph
adapted @entity28 , called ' @entity33 ' by the development team can initiate lane changes and passing manoeuvres without driver *intervention*
