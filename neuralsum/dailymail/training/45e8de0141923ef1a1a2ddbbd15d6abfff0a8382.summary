the futuristic property , in @entity14 , @entity15 , was built in 2005 by @entity1 superfan @entity16 , managing director of @entity17			1
and just like the @entity1 ' radio sign off - the stunning home is certainly f.a.b. the local property developer says many of the striking exterior features - such as the blue glass and iconic copper roof - were all taken from the tv show			2
and while the property does lack many of the features of the original @entity3 villa - it does n't open up to allow missiles or jets to fly out - it still boasts five en - suite bedrooms , another three bathrooms , a cinema room , a luxury fitted kitchen and a large living space spanning across the ground floor			1
unique : the curved design and blue glass windows were both taken from the @entity1 base featured in the popular 1960s tv show spacious : the £ 3million property boasts five en - suite bedrooms , three additional bathrooms , its own cinema and an outdoor pool located in the highly sought after @entity67 area , there is also an outdoor swimming pool , gym and a triple car garage , as well as a large private garden to explore			1

luxury : the property is just as luxurious as the fictional home of the @entity96 in @entity1 and priced at just £ 3million - it 's bargain hunters are go high tech : while the property ca n't open up to launch missiles or armed jets , most electronics in the property can be operated from a single keypad ' although the house is contemporary , it is far removed from some of the square and minimalist houses which have become prolific in the area			1
' @entity74 also occupies a magnificent plot , undoubtedly one of the best in @entity67 and @entity112			0
' houses in the road have sold for up to £ 4 million so we believe this could be an excellent opportunity for somebody who wants to acquire a highly individual house at a realistic price - point			0
' the unique features of this luxury abode have been recognised with a number of awards , including best private home in the 2006 @entity126 awards			0
