by @entity0 and @entity1 a man has been captured on video drinking an entire bottle of white wine in four seconds as his friends cheered him on			1
the gentleman - known only as @entity8 - is seen unscrewing the cap before putting several straws inside the @entity12 straws would allow liquid to be replaced by air so the fluid can be consumed quicker			2
without flinching , he then puts it to his mouth before tipping it upside down and consuming the lot			0
the man 's friends then gather around him - with one giving him a congratulatory pat on the back			2
the person who uploaded the video on to the @entity47 captioned the video : ' our friend @entity8 has always been good at downing drinks so on this monday night we tested him with a bottle of house white			1
' he drinks the contents of the entire bottle before neatly plonking it back on to a table believed to be in a pub experts today condemned the video , saying it was ' dangerous '			1
they warned the video may also be damaging for the man as it could be seen by future employers			2
dr @entity66 , medical adviser to alcohol education charity @entity67 , said : ' young people often say they feel peer pressure to drink to fit in , but competitions to drink excessively in a short space of time can be dangerous and this should not come as a surprise			2
' quite apart from the risk of accident or injury as a result of drinking to excess , there is another aspect to these online drinking games which is the ' cybershame ' some young people may experience			0
' @entity67 research shows nearly half of 18 - 24 year olds admitted un-tagging drunk photos of themselves that they did n’t want others to see			0
the government advises that people should not regularly drink more than the daily unit guidelines of 3 - 4 units of alcohol for men and 2 - 3 units of alcohol for women ' however there is still a chance that these photos may be seen by universities and prospective employers			1
so while it may seem like a lot of fun at the time , the range of negative consequences are no laughing matter			0
' binge drinking is defined by the @entity28 as drinking more than double the daily unit guidelines in one session			1
for men this is over eight units , and for women , over six , the charity @entity116 says			0
however , the rate at which they reach intoxication varies because individuals are all different			0
