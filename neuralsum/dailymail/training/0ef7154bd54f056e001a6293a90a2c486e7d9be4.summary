it is reproduced in full below military : mr @entity1 , who signed up for the army in 1934 , died in 1974 aged 56 how sleeps the beast in the soul of man , the urge to do what 's wrong , it is easy to fight it , some men can , but others are not so strong			1
so when the final reckonings come , remember he who tried , and share the laurels one by one , do not their souls divide			0
why do the weak men have to fight , the strong man not to worry , why the fit man take his time , the lame man have to hurry ? â€˜ tis the way of life that 's given so we just must not grumble , and if we want to go to heaven , give a right good smile at a tumble .			0
