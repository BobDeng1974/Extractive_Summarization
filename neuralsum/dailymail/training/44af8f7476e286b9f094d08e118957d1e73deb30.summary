women who live near their mother are more likely to become mothers themselves			0
one reason is that relatives can provide help with looking after a young child , a study by @entity5 researchers shows			1
it also found that a mother 's influence is a major pressure on women to have children			1
women trying to get pregnant are more likely to succeed if they live near their mothers or other close relatives the researchers believe that having potential childcare close by helps a woman 's psychological state , but say even they were surprised by the strength of the link			1
they looked at a series of studies carried out on nearly 2,000 women where records were kept on their fertility but also their lifestyle , health and social status			1
this included questions about their relationship with their immediate family , their extended family and their networks of friends			0
those women trying for a baby and getting pregnant more quickly tended to have their family nearby , not just for their first child but for subsequent children , too			1
dr @entity46 from the @entity5 said : ' we were surprised that we actually found a significant effect			2
' we thought that maybe there might be a relationship , but we were surprised that the relationship remained even after we controlled for a whole myriad of social and economic background factors			2
it 's thought that having potential childcare close by boosts a woman 's fertility as she feels psychologically calmer ' comparing two young women who have effectively the same income , education , religion , ethnicity , the young woman who is closer to her family still seems to find it significantly easier to have children			1
' we know that having kin around is beneficial in terms of having children in high - fertility resource - poor populations , both in developing countries and in historical @entity74			0
' we were surprised that even in a very different setting , a modern technologically advanced society such as @entity76 , we still see the same pattern			0
' economically , having ' free ' childcare from a relative seems important to would - be mums , particularly for mothers of one child to go on and have a second one			0
yet women may be fooling themselves that this is the best option , said the researchers , for it could also be preventing them from finding much better paid work in areas much further away			2
@entity91 founder @entity91 said : ' the support of extended family is important to the wellbeing of mothers after they 've given birth			0

link remains when women are of same *age* , income and social class , say @entity5 researchers
thought the psychological boost of having nearby family *members* may improve a woman 's fertility
