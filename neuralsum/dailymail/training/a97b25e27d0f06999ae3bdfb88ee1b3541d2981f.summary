@entity0 made it 20 league goals by november in @entity4 ’s 4 - 0 win over @entity5 – no wonder @entity7 could be seen imitating his top scorer ’s goal celebration on the touchline			1

this was always going to be tough for @entity5 whose 16m budget for their entire squad would n’t pay @entity0 ’s salary			2
they started brightly but were gradually undone by @entity4 ’s 300m forward line			0
@entity4 could have taken the lead on seven minutes when @entity73 dipped a vicious free - kick from 30 - yards out and @entity5 keeper @entity100 did well to adjust his position to tip the ball over			1
when the first goal came it was controversial with two possible claims for offside			0
@entity0 crossed to @entity74 who looked offside as he tried to poke it past @entity100			2
his shot ran back out to @entity0 who , now also looked offside as this time , he picked out @entity35 at the back post , and the @entity110 headed home			1
@entity5 had a chance to equalize when @entity49 found @entity113 and only a fine save from @entity65 kept @entity4 ahead			2
@entity0 then got his name on the scoresheet when @entity73 and @entity66 cominbed down the right and from @entity66 ’s cross @entity0 found the bottom corner			0
he has now scored in his last 11 league games			0
@entity27 once scored in 21 straight matches but on this form you would n’t back against @entity0 beating that record too			2
in the second half @entity74 made it 3 - 0 converting @entity35 ’s cross into the roof of @entity100 ’s net			1
@entity5 players complained that the ball had gone out of play when the @entity110 hooked it back across the face of the goal for @entity74 to finish			1
@entity0 then got the fourth from the spot to complete the rout			2
it was an impressive performance from @entity4 in their first game without @entity142 who will be out for three months with a tendon injury in his left thigh			0
despite his absence @entity147 target @entity77 was still left on the bench just a month from being able to negotiate a free transfer away from the club			0
the result kept @entity4 on top of the table			0
they had overcome a potentially tricky international break game , winning their first league encounter ever in @entity158			0
and they had made it look frightening easy			0
