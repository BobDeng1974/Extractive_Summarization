she is also a member of @entity5 ’s @entity17 , which is made up of senior @entity5 mps – including leader @entity19 – and sets the direction of party policies			1
the appointment raises more questions about the unions ’ influence over mr @entity19 , after @entity2 was accused of rigging a parliamentary selection contest in @entity27 to try to get @entity28 , a close friend of mr @entity1 , chosen as the candidate by signing up new union members without their knowledge			0
mrs @entity10 ’s new role will fan the flames as she will be helping as many union supporters as possible get picked as @entity5 candidates for the 2015 general election			1
it is understood she has already challenged mr @entity19 over his response to @entity27 , telling him he should not have brought in the police			0

' i am sure you will agree with me that this appointment now begs new questions as to whether @entity2 ’s leadership is not only rigging @entity5 selections , but also appointments to its senior team			2
‘ i call on you on to join me in condemning this appointment , and that you investigate the process under which it was made			0
