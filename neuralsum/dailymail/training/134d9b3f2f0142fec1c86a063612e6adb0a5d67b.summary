by @entity0 today we have all sorts of drugs and equipment to prevent the spread of life - threatening diseases			0
but an ancient parasite egg discovered in a 6,200 - year - old grave hints that humans unwittingly spread disease using the earliest farming technology			1
the schistosomiasis parasite egg was unearthed with a skeleton in a prehistoric town by the @entity14 in @entity15			1
an ancient parasite egg discovered in a 6,200 year - old grave ( pictured ) hints that humans accidentally spread disease using the early irrigation systems			1
the egg was discovered in the pelvic area of the skeleton , where the intestines and bladder would have been @entity24 - also known as snail fever - is a disease caused by parasitic worms , which can infect the urinary tract or intestines			1
the disease is spread by contact with water that contains the parasites - hence the danger posed by irrigation systems			2
the parasites are released from freshwater snails that have been infected			0
today , the disease is especially common among children in developing countries as they are more likely to play in infected water			0
methods to prevent the disease include improving access to clean water and reducing the number of snails			0
in areas where the disease is common , entire groups may be treated all at once and yearly with the medication praziquantel			0
@entity24 currently affects almost 210 million people worldwide			0
between 12,000 and 200,000 people die from it each year			0
@entity24 - also known as snail fever - is a disease caused by parasitic worms , which can infect the urinary tract or intestines			0
the disease is spread by contact with water that contains the parasites - hence the danger posed by irrigation systems			2
the parasites are released from freshwater snails that have been infected			0
it can spread a disease that causes kidney failure , among other potentially fatal conditions			2
it is thought the egg could be the first evidence that agricultural irrigation systems in the @entity70 helped spread diseases caused by deadly flatworm parasites that live in the blood vessels of the bladder and intestines			1
researchers believe the disease was spread by the introduction of crop irrigation across ancient @entity79 , the region along the @entity80 that is now part of modern day @entity82 , @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity15 and @entity86			2
the study , published in @entity88 , revealed that the parasite can cause anaemia , kidney failure , and even bladder cancer			1

this image shows a schistosome egg recovered from the pelvic sediment of the skeleton researchers believe the disease was spread by the introduction of crop irrigation across ancient @entity79 , the region along the @entity80 that is now part of modern day @entity82 , @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity15 ( marked at a ) and @entity86 ‘ the individual who contracted the parasite might have done so through the use of irrigation systems that were starting to be introduced in @entity79 around 7,500 years ago , ’ dr @entity104 , at the @entity105 , said			1
the schistosomiasis parasite egg was unearthed by a skeleton ( pictured ) in a prehistoric town by the @entity14 in @entity15 ‘ the parasite spends part of its life cycle in snails that live in warm fresh water , before leaving the snail to burrow through the skin of people wading or swimming in the water			1
‘ these irrigation systems distributed water to crops and may have triggered the beginning of the enormous disease burden that schistosomiasis has caused over the past 6,000 years			1
' the discovery was made by archaeologists from @entity105 , @entity130 and @entity131 , and is older than the @entity24 egg discovered in @entity134 mummies from 5,200 years ago			1
the egg was found in the pelvic area of the body , where the intestines and bladder would have been			2
dr @entity104 added : ‘ @entity24 has become progressively more common over time so that it causes a huge burden across the world today , with over 200 million people infected			0
‘ it causes anaemia which significantly decreases physical productivity in infected people , and may also cause bladder cancer			0
‘ we would expect these consequences in ancient peoples to have had a significant impact upon early civilisations in the region			0

the grave and egg were discovered by the @entity14 in @entity15 , where agricultural irrigation systems were used up to 7,500 years ago
it could be the first evidence that these systems spread disease in the area
