jailed : @entity0 stole £ 4,200 from vulnerable @entity1 while pretending to care for her a carer stole thousands of pounds from the 90 - year - old dementia victim she was supposed to be looking after finding her pin written in her diary			1
@entity0 left her frail victim @entity1 ' heartbroken ' by abusing her trust to plunder £ 4,200 from her bank account over a seven - month period			1
the victim was so upset by the crime that she has had to leave her home in @entity13 , south @entity14 and move into sheltered accommodation			1
@entity0 , 59 , visited mrs @entity1 twice a week and stole her bank card so she could withdraw large amounts of cash , using the code written in the elderly woman 's diary			1
she even stole money while mrs @entity1 was ill in hospital , @entity22 heard			2
sentencing @entity0 to 12 months in jail , @entity25 told her : ' the victim was in her nineties , had problems with dementia , and , effectively , you inveigled your way into her family			1
' he added : ' it 's still unclear to me why you would do that to someone of that age , why you would cause her that much pain , which , in the end , was n't really for that much money			0
' but time and time again you took her card and took money from her account			0
it seems almost every time you went to her house you would have taken money			0
' mrs @entity1 , who has four children and eight grand - children , had lived at the same house for around 30 years , but she was so distressed by the crime that her dementia deteriorated and she had to move into care			1
' one of the features of this case which is disturbing is that she had to leave her home , ' mr @entity25 said			2
in a victim impact statement read to the court , mrs @entity1 said : ' i know @entity0 does not have a mother , but that is no reason to do what she did			1
' you were trusted by me and i 'm heartbroken			0
it 's disgusting what @entity0 did to me			2
it worries me she could have done it to other people			0
' @entity72 , prosecuting , told the court that mrs @entity1 paid @entity0 £ 10 every time she visited			1
the thief 's deception was found out when mrs @entity1 's daughter @entity77 , 70 , saw that there was money missing from her bank account in july last year			1
hearing : @entity13 @entity81 ( above ) heard @entity0 even stole money while mrs @entity1 was ill in hospital ' she noticed there was £ 2,000 , or £ 3,000 less than what there should have been , ' mr @entity72 said			1
mrs @entity77 then took a closer look at her mother 's bank statement and noticed ' a pattern of sums of £ 100 and £ 200 withdrawn over a significant period of time ' , he added			2
she notified the police who checked @entity97 footage from the @entity98 in @entity13 and identified @entity0 withdrawing £ 100 from the victim 's account the previous day			2
@entity0 , from @entity101 in @entity102 , was arrested and pleaded guilty to fraud at an earlier hearing			0
speaking outside court today , mrs @entity77 said her family was ' elated ' by the jail sentence , but added : ' it 's had a detrimental effect on mum - she has deteriorated badly			0
' part of that is due to her age , but every time i see her she mentions it and says , " why did she take it ? " and " how could she do that ? " ' when i told her about the sentence it was the first time i have seen her smile for a long time			0
' mrs @entity77 said she was ' disgusted ' by @entity123 , whom her family had known for around five years , saying : ' if she had been handed a suspended sentence she would have done it again tomorrow			0
' i think she has gotten away with it up until now , but we were n't going to let her get away with it			0
