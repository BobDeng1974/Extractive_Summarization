after an initial confusion , @entity2 tugged and pulled at the garment for the best part of 30 minutes and finally decided to wear it her own way			0
at one stage the ten - year - old gorilla diva managed to get the blue top over her head and an arm through one of her sleeves , looking mightily pleased with herself			0
perfect match : @entity2 the gorilla manages to get her hands on a blue t - shirt and like any curious ape she wants to try on her new outfit but then came the trick of taking it off			1

@entity35 , 40 , from @entity36 , said : ‘ the keeper threw the shirt to @entity2 which surprised me as i 've never seen them do it before			2
‘ @entity2 had a blast with the blue t - shirt , she ran with it , tried to put it on and then ripped it when it would n't fit nicely on her			1
