forty years ago this week , the nation was captivated by one of the most horrendous crimes in living memory			0
an unprovoked frenzied axe attack by a total stranger on a ten - year - old as she walked home from school			1
and as police launched one of the biggest manhunt in @entity14 history and detectives chased down leads on the appalling crime , only one thing seemed certain : that little @entity18 would never leave a normal , happy life - if she survived at all			2
but @entity18 has made a remarkable recovery , defying the negligible odds she was given by medics in the wake of the shocking attack			1
not only did she go on to regain movement and speech following pioneering treatment in the @entity28 , but she also went on to have two children - and has now welcomed her first grandson into her life			1
' she added : ' i was just going home from school and i went to the shortcut - that was the railway track - and for no reason somebody hit me over the head with an axe			2
' now i have got @entity56 , who is 15 now and @entity57 , 18 , and she is a mother as well			0
i 'm now a nan to @entity58			2
' smiling as she sits next to her mother , the sight is a far cry from what the family expected when surgeons told her mother @entity67 to ' forget her daughter ' and leave her to die in hospital			1
medics had told @entity67 that her ten - year - old had barely any chance of survival and would be unable to walk or talk if she did make it through			1
her mother said : ' i just ca n't believe how it has all turned out , i never imagined that i would be a grandmother , never mind a great - grandmother			2
' at this point in my life , i am so very happy			0
we have had our problems along the way , but i am so very glad i did n't listen to the surgeon who told me to just leave her			1
' the attack , which sent shockwaves through the community , took place on february 13 , 1975			0
desperate to get home after the school bell rang at @entity89 for the day , @entity18 had thrown on her backpack and began walking back to her home in @entity38 , as she did every day			1
but , as she took a shortcut along the railway embankment , she was struck over the head by the mystery attacker , who split open her skull in one of 15 excruciating blows			0
evidence : @entity18 sits on her mother @entity67 's lap as she talks to chief inspector @entity102 about what happened manhunt : the attack , which sent shockwaves through the community , sparked one of the biggest manhunts ever carried out by @entity14 but the attacker disappeared detectives search the area where @entity18 was attacked for clues			1
the incident took place on february 13 , 1975 so desperate were @entity18 's attempt to shield herself from the man 's menacing attack that her left hand was almost severed as she tried to protect her head			1
in hospital , surgeons removed a piece of brain tissue the size of an egg			0
but , despite the work carried out by medics , they warned @entity18 's devastated family that , if she even survived to the end of the week , she would never walk or talk again			1
for her mother @entity67 , who lives with @entity18 and her family in @entity134 , the memory of what happened is as clear as if it were yesterday			1
' the cat was ill , so i was planning on taking her to the vet after work , ' said @entity67 , 69			2
' i had told @entity18 that , if she was not home in time , i would go on to the vet so as i did n't miss them before closing			1
' she was n't there , so i left her a note saying that she should stay at home until i got back			1
i remember clearly that the weather was dreadful and i thought twice about going , but the cat really needed to see the vet			0
' when @entity67 got back , she found her neighbour at home , who was ' white as a sheet '			1
re-enactment : police re-enacted the attack on @entity18 alongside the @entity160 railway line , @entity38 the young girl leaves her home with her mother @entity67 to meet a police car , which was waiting to take her to the re-enactment of the attack return : despite her ordeal , @entity18 returned to the same spot where she had been attacked 12 months later to help police re-enact the scene , in the hope of finding the mystery man probe : detective constable @entity172 retraces the steps taken by @entity18 on the day of the fateful attack			1
@entity18 's friend @entity175 ( pictured front ) also walked with the officer ' i remember thinking it was strange because the neighbour had red hair and a red face , but he was white as a sheet , ' she said			2
' he followed me into the house and i saw immediately that @entity18 's coat and shoes were not where she usually left them and the note had n't been touched			1
i knew immediately something bad had happened and they took me straight to the hospital , but i still did n't know how bad it was			0
' when @entity67 got to the hospital , @entity18 's father broke the devastating news			1
' he told me she had been hit 15 times with an axe - 15 times , ' says @entity67			2
' i do n't know how i managed to stay upright			0
that was the biggest shock of all and then i was n't able to see her because she was in surgery			0
' when we finally got to see her , she was all bandaged up and her eyes were almost closed			0
there was blood on her legs because they had been so focused on the surgery they had not had time to clean her up			0
none of it felt very real , it was like waking up in a nightmare			0
' @entity215 ( left ) came to @entity18 's rescue following the brutal attack , after finding her in a ditch near the railway line			2
police hunting the attacker issued a photofit of the suspect ( right ) fear : parents who would usually let their children walk home alone from @entity89 arrive at the school to the collect them following the attack ' they told me that if she survived the next three days , she would never walk or talk again			1
' one doctor told me to go away , leave @entity18 with them and to forget about her			0
he said i was young enough to have another family , but there was no way i was going to leave my daughter there			0
' despite advances in forensic science , the brazen attacker has never been caught			0
cruelly , heavy rain washed the evidence away and they have never been found			0
but the mystery over the attacker 's identity became secondary to the remarkable recovery story which was to follow			1
family : @entity18 's children @entity57 , now 18 , and @entity56 , now 15 , ( left ) and her grandson @entity58 , 16 months surgeons at @entity253 tried to explain to @entity18 's parents how badly injured she was			1
' at the end of the day , they were not giving us much hope , and said that she was likely to be a vegetable because her brain injury was so severe , ' recalls @entity67			2
@entity67 refused to believe the doctors and took her daughter to @entity28 for pioneering assessment at the @entity263			1
with financial help from friends , @entity18 endured six years of physical and mental exercises , which lasted 14 hours a day			0
when they started the treatment , @entity18 was in a wheelchair , unable to feed herself			2
by the end , she was able to hold down a job in an electronics factory			0
@entity18 's health continued to go from strength to strength			0
she soon met @entity276 and together they had children @entity57 , now 18 , and @entity56 , 15			0
then , 16 months ago , @entity57 gave birth to @entity58 - her first grandchild			0
@entity58 's birth , which made @entity67 a great - grandmother , was yet another chapter in @entity18 's story which the family never thought they would see			1
@entity67 said : ' they get embarrassed when i say it , but i am so , so proud of them all			0
' when @entity18 was pregnant first time , i did n't tell anyone , but i really hoped that she would have a girl because i could get to see a little girl grow up the way they should			2
