by @entity0 published : 02:17 est , 10 january 2014 updated : 20:59 est , 10 january 2014 the final whistle had just brought the curtain down on @entity3 ’s worst week for two decades when the questions started			1
chief among the topics being fiercely discussed was the plight of one young winger , who had sat impassively on the bench as his team - mates laboured against @entity11 , suffering their third defeat in seven numbing days			2
he can take teams apart , too			2
on a freezing night in @entity37 last march , he tore through @entity39 ’s under 21s ; @entity22 was also the reason @entity41 reached the @entity43 play - off final in may , with two goals against @entity45			1
this young man can play			2
so surely , @entity3 supporters argued , there was something more sinister behind @entity22 ’s inactivity ? why else would a player who commanded a fee rising to £ 15million last january be forced to endure a campaign in which his time on the pitch adds up to a meagre 167 minutes ? theorists say it is an agenda			1
the truth is much simpler			2
@entity25 is not a manager who will keep a player sidelined for no apparent reason			2
in his world , the team is king and winning is all that matters ; he wants those he chooses to go to war with to have many qualities but it would be risible to say he favours artisans over artists			0
hard work and discipline are virtues he extols but , above all , he wants players who provide magic			0
you only have to spend time in his company , away from the glare of cameras and microphones , to see him enthuse about those individuals who have a style and swagger above the norm			0
@entity22 has the tools to thrill – he has been known to start competitions with @entity90 ’s @entity89 during @entity16 under 21 training sessions to see who can produce the best moment of skill – but does he have the correct attitude ? the answer , at the moment , would have to be no. @entity22 failed to impress with his body language during the @entity43 last summer ; he never looked like he wanted to be in @entity99 and that enraged the @entity16 players who had given everything to be there			1
outcasts : both @entity22 ( right ) and @entity104 have got used to life on the bench under @entity25 game - changer : @entity22 was electric during his time at @entity41 ( right ) but has n't hit those heights ... yet @entity14 has played a mere 28 minutes in the @entity23 for @entity3 in two cameo substitute appearances - and he had to wait for december for his first top - flight match			1
dec 7 : @entity3 0 @entity113 1 ( 22 mins ) dec 15 : @entity114 0 @entity3 3 ( six mins ) he has not really made an impact in those games , having just 29 touches in 28 minutes			1
he has had one ( off - target ) shot , and has tried just 11 passes , completing 64 per cent of them			2
most surprisingly for @entity15 , given his style of play , he has attempted just four dribbles and only one of those has been a success			0
his one cross also came to nothing			0
@entity131 is not something that will be tolerated at @entity19 , either			0
@entity25 will be scrutinising @entity22 every day on the training pitches at @entity134 ; his coaching staff talk to him all the time , reporting what he has done well and the areas on which he can improve			2
if @entity22 was hitting the levels expected of a @entity3 player , pushing himself to the limit and striving to improve , there is no question @entity25 would have used him in more than just four games ( and one of those was the @entity149 )			1
as he continues to be out of the team , you can deduce that he does n’t yet appreciate what is expected of him			0
' @entity153 has not appeared , ’ @entity25 said			0
‘ we have not felt we have had the opportunity			0
i want @entity153 to get used to what happens here			0
it is important @entity153 gets to see the level of the training here , the level of the players and the quality they have got			0
’ silverware : @entity14 holds the @entity43 play - off trophy after helping @entity41 to the top flight demanding : @entity25 offers some advice to his young player during @entity3 's pre-season tour arm round the shoulder : but @entity25 has rarely uttered the words , ' on you go , son ' to @entity22 those words were delivered on october 15 last year , so the fact he has started one @entity179 tie and made two cameo appearances in the @entity23 since makes it clear @entity22 has ' not got better ' as quickly as @entity25 would have anticipated			1
it would , of course , be wrong to write off his @entity3 career at this juncture but it is equally difficult to escape the feeling that @entity22 needs to appreciate what an opportunity he has			1
if he continues to drift along , it will be gone before he realises what he had			0
‘ i am sure in time he will be an asset for @entity3 but i guess everything there with the new manager and everything , everybody is getting used to a new way of working , ’ @entity16 under 21 head coach @entity192 observed last autumn			1
time to shine : @entity22 will have to up his game if he is to break into the @entity3 first team the competition : wide men @entity204 ( left ) and @entity205 ( right ) are preferred to the youthful @entity15 final fling : £ 15m @entity22 was sir @entity208 's last purchase as @entity3 manager ‘ @entity153 has only just arrived there and i think from his point of view , it is as important that the new manager can see what he is about as it is for him to go and play first - team football			1
they will make a decision ( about loaning him out ) based on that , i am sure			0
’ @entity3 are willing to let @entity22 leave on loan this window			1
that @entity25 is prepared to sanction such a move means he does n’t feel sir @entity208 ’s final buy is ready to contribute			1
only time will tell if he ever is			0
abject : @entity22 was part of a poor @entity16 campaign at the @entity43 in @entity99 that 's better : in march last year , @entity22 was in fine form against @entity39 in @entity37 bust up : @entity22 ( in ring , yellow boots ) and @entity16 team - mate @entity229 ( red boots ) have a scuffle			1

@entity235 has played just 167 minutes for @entity3 this season
he has made only two appearances in the @entity23
@entity3 are willing to let @entity22 go out on loan this month
the 21 - year - old was signed for *big* money from @entity41 last january
he was sir @entity208 's final buy as @entity3 manager
