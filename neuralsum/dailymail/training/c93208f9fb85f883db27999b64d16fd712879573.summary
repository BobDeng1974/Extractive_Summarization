@entity4 constable @entity3 , who was based in @entity15 , was found with 3000 pictures of underage girls on his computer , of which 16 were of them posing naked or half naked			1
@entity3 was arrested on august 7 last year following an investigation which found he had surfed sites which promoted themselves as sources of ' jailbait ' images			1
the 29 - year - old had received a commendation award in 2007 for his work at a murder scene in @entity27 where music producer @entity28 was shot dead			0
@entity29 heard that a search of his laptop recovered the images , which included 16 classified as indecent			1
detective constable @entity35 from the @entity36 said the haul included girls aged between 13 and 16 posing semi-naked in the shower and a girl of about 14 embracing another girl while semi-naked on a bed			1
they were deemed to be of level one , the lowest category of five			0
' it was based on what the girls look like , how formed they were and their faces in terms of determining how old they were , ' he told the court			2
' in my opinion 16 of these images were children			1
' of the rest of the photos , @entity57 said : ' they depicted more girls aged mainly 13 to 18 years old			2
' they were predominately schoolgirls , in school uniform at school , or bikinis at the beach			1
they were not indecent but they were in variety of settings and scenarios			2
' during his evidence , @entity3 claimed that the images downloaded onto his machine without his knowledge while he was searching for legitimate pornographic material			1
however , district judge @entity76 , dismissed this claim			0
he said there was no way that the officer did not know what he was doing			0
' mr @entity3 has given evidence and i have said that i did not find it terribly convincing , ' said the judge			2
' [ his claim that ] " i am looking for 18 or 19 year olds which seek to pass themselves off as being younger " , is neither realistic or credible			0
' it is clear that if he is looking for , as he accepts he was , the underage look , he finds that interesting , simulating or whatever , and he is looking for that			0
' i do n’t think he is looking for 18 or 19 - year - olds that look younger , he would be likely to look at younger women			0
' he added : ' it does not matter where these images came from and when they were downloaded , it is sufficient in this case for the court to conclude that the defendant was browsing for such images of people under 16			2
' i am satisfied that he deliberately , knowingly brought these images onto his screen			0
' the court heard that an analysis of @entity3 ’s computer showed he was browsing a website with a name including the sick term ' jail bait ' , while his search history included terms such as ' teen jail bait '			1
during the trial , the court heard evidence from forensic computer expert @entity119			0
he said the site would be shut down under @entity122 rules but continues running because it is based in the @entity123 despite 36 complaints to the @entity125 accusing the website of hosting inappropriate photos of children , mr @entity119 said it continued to operate because @entity123 legislation was different than that in the @entity122			0
