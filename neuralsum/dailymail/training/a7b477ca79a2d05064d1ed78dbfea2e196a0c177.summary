by @entity0 ' you can still finish first without being attractive ' : researchers said @entity4 winner @entity3 might be bucking the trend they already get the girl			1
now it seems that handsome men also finish first in endurance sports			2
a study of the elite cyclists in the @entity12 found that the best - looking men raced ahead			2
it is thought just as a stag ’s antlers are a sign of strength and masculinity , a man ’s face advertises his underlying staying power			1
the @entity23 researchers began by showing people head and shoulder shots of elite cyclists from the @entity27 and asking them to rate their looks			1
they then compared this with how well they did in the race , which covers 2,000 miles in 23 days and is often considered to be the world ’s toughest endurance event			0
as a rider ’s overall position is highly dependent on team tactics , the calculation also included the men ’s performance when racing in individual time trials			0
the best - looking cyclists were also the fastest , the journal @entity42 reports			0
importantly , although the men and women judging the photos knew the men were cyclists , they did not know how good they were at the sport			2
this , said researcher @entity49 , shows evidence of a link between looks and endurance			0
he thinks that women in particular have evolved to use a man ’s face as quick way of judging his endurance			1
good performance : @entity60 , the reigning world champion , fared well in the study by @entity23 researchers in times gone by , a man with staying power would be able to last the pace when hunting for days on end on the plains of @entity69 and bring back food for the family			1
it is also possible that the men who did best were the most competitive and there is something about a determination to win that we find appealing			0
@entity79 @entity78 was judged to be the most handsome cyclist			0
@entity60 , the reigning world champion , also fared well			0
' @entity3 could be a good example of the relationship between good looks and endurance			1
or he may show you can still finish first without being attractive ' @entity86 , @entity87 unfortunately @entity27 winner @entity3 and fellow @entity4 @entity89 and @entity90 were excluded from the analysis			1
reasons for this included them wearing caps or sunglasses in the official team photos used – making it difficult for their looks to be scrutinised			0
dr @entity49 , of the @entity87 , said : ‘ i have heard mixed reports about the attractiveness of @entity3			1
‘ he could be a good example of the relationship between good looks and endurance			0
or he may show you can still finish first without being attractive - that there is still hope for everyone			2

women have ' evolved to judge a man *'s* *physical* prowess from his face '
those with staying power to hunt and feed family appear more attractive
but @entity23 researchers say @entity3 might be bucking the trend
