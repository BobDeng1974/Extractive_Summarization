a friend sent me a very interesting document last week			2
it is @entity5 ’s wage bill ... from august 17 , 1960			1
you ’ll recognise the names if not the sums			2
@entity10 winner @entity9 takes home 22 quid ; @entity11 £ 18 and 13 shillings ; and @entity13 legend @entity12 collects £ 16 and two shillings per week and pays the club £ 2 to rent a house			1
@entity17 must have counted as an executive , because he is not listed , but @entity19 and @entity20 are already on the staff , giving some idea of the wealth and depth of experience in that famous boot room			0
different times , of course			0
@entity5 ’s wage bill from august 17 , 1960 , featuring @entity11 , @entity19 , @entity20 , and more 1966 @entity10 winner @entity9 scores beyond @entity30 goalkeeper @entity29 in 1959 @entity9 took home £ 22 - a far cry from modern wages - as the @entity5 's wage bill from august 1960 shows this was also the last year that football had a maximum wage			1
we often hear that money has ruined the game			0
it will have an effect on any industry			0
yet players today get what they are worth in a commercial environment that generates billions			0
@entity5 were a @entity47 team in 1960 - 61 , but still drew 43,041 for their first home match with @entity49 three days after these salaries were paid			1
that game ended in a 2 - 0 win			2
makes you wonder where it all went , once the man the fans came to see took out his 20 quid			0
@entity19 ( pictured ) and @entity20 were already on the training staff on @entity61 's revealed document @entity20 ( pictured ) was among the training staff when @entity5 were a @entity47 team in 1960 - 61			1
