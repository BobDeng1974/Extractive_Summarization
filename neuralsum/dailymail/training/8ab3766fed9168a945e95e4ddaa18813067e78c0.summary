by @entity0 published : 17:03 est , 9 march 2013 updated : 09:37 est , 10 march 2013 when soprano @entity2 steps on to the pitch in front of 81,000 rugby fans at @entity6 this afternoon , she hopes to dazzle in a stylish outfit that wo n’t suffer the sort of revealing wardrobe malfunction that made headlines at the @entity11 a fortnight ago			1
yet away from the limelight , the 22 - year - old shuns glamour for the rough and tumble of rugby first - hand – playing full - back for her local club in @entity19 where spectators number in the dozens , not the tens of thousands			1
now , in this exclusive @entity23 photoshoot , the ‘ @entity30 ’ shows off both sides of her image , posing in both a mud - splattered @entity27 kit and a @entity29 designer gown			1
pitch perfect : @entity2 in an @entity32 , left , and modelling a gown by designer @entity29 ‘ it ’s nice to feel girly and glamorous sometimes , ’ @entity2 says			1
but she admits that her last appearance as @entity27 ’s official anthem singer – when a gust of wind lifted up her white split - to - the - armpit @entity40 dress and exposed her hotpants – was n’t quite the image she was hoping to project			1
‘ you ’re representing your country , ’ she says			2
‘ you do n’t want to overstep the mark			1
’ she promises to be more demure when she sings at today ’s @entity27 - @entity48 clash			1
‘ i ca n’t wear any less , ’ she admits			1
‘ could you call it a dress ? it was a bit of material , was n’t it ? there were wind issues last time , but i did n’t really think about it			2
i just wanted to go out and look good and sing well			1
’ high note : @entity2 revealed a little too much of her white hotpants when she sang the national anthem ahead of the @entity11 match between @entity27 and @entity61 at @entity6 last month there is little doubt that @entity2 takes everything she does seriously			1
as well as studying at the @entity65 and working on her third solo album , she is training for the @entity68 and an international @entity70 challenge , an intense discipline combining weightlifting , sprinting and gymnastics			2
@entity74 , not singing , was her first love , and she relishes her time playing for the @entity77 , nicknamed the ‘ @entity78 ’ , even if it means that she is forever having to cover the cuts on her legs for her professional singing engagements			0
‘ i ca n’t tell you how your body feels after a rugby match , ’ she says			2
‘ it ’s like nothing else , like no other sport i ’ve ever done			0
’ her first match after her last @entity6 appearance was against @entity91			0
‘ they were quite aggressive at the beginning , ’ she recalls			0
‘ we did n’t win but we only lost 20 - nil			2
it was a vast improvement , as the first time we lost 55 - nil			2
’ action girl : @entity27 's official national anthem soprano singer @entity2 also plays for full - back for her team @entity77 @entity101 - born @entity2 has been hailed as the next @entity102 , although it is a comparison @entity2 dislikes			1
she says : ‘ @entity102 has done so well , but i want to make my own name			0
it ’s so funny how different we are			0
when i ’m not working , i ’m always in jeans and trainers			0
i respect what she does , but i want to do things differently			0
’ @entity2 shot to prominence when she won @entity114 ’s @entity116 competition at 15			1
she then became the youngest member of the classical girl band @entity118 , leaving after she won her college place			0
nevertheless , combining demands there with her own career is difficult			0
@entity2 explains : ‘ it ’s been a struggle			1
there are five singers in my year			2
so the college is going to expect a lot of you , that ’s understandable			0
but i ’d be silly not to take all the opportunities given to me			0
as a performer , you want to perform to as many people as possible			0
’ and she certainly wo n’t be short of an audience at @entity6 today .			0
