by @entity0 published : 06:56 est , 7 october 2013 updated : 17:33 est , 7 october 2013 @entity2 @entity1 and @entity3 and @entity5 - born researcher @entity4 have won the 2013 @entity6 in medicine for discoveries on how hormones , enzymes and other key substances are transported within cells			1
this traffic control system keeps activities inside cells from descending into chaos and has helped researchers gain a better understanding of a range of diseases including diabetes and disorders affecting the immune system			1
the discoveries have helped doctors diagnose a severe form of epilepsy and immune deficiency diseases in children , @entity6 committee secretary @entity23 said			1
americans @entity1 and @entity3 and @entity5 - born researcher @entity4 won the 2013 @entity6 in medicine for discoveries on how hormones , enzymes and other key substances are transported within cells in the future , scientists hope the research could lead to the development of medicines to treat more common types of epilepsy , diabetes and other metabolism deficiencies , he said			1
professor @entity1 , 62 , is a professor at @entity42 while professor @entity3 , 64 , is at the @entity43			1
dr @entity4 , 57 , joined @entity44 in 2008			1
professor @entity3 said he was woken up at 1am at his home in @entity46 by the chairman of the prize committee and was still suffering from jetlag after returning from a trip to @entity51 the night before			2
‘ i was n't thinking too straight			0
i did n't have anything elegant to say , ’ he told @entity52			0
‘ all i could say was “ oh my @entity54 ” , and that was that			0
’ he called the prize a wonderful acknowledgement of the work he and his students had done and said he knew it would change his life			0
the discoveries have helped doctors diagnose a severe form of epilepsy and immune deficiency diseases in children , @entity6 committee secretary @entity23 said			1
image shows the winners being announced ‘ i called my lab manager and i told him to go buy a couple bottles of @entity72 and expect to have a celebration with my lab , ’ he said			0
the @entity6 committee said the three researchers ’ work on ‘ vesicle traffic ’ - the transport system of our cells - helped scientists understand how ‘ cargo is delivered to the right place at the right time ’ inside cells			1
vesicles are tiny bubbles that act as cargo carriers			0
‘ imagine hundreds of thousands of people who are travelling around hundreds of miles of streets - how are they going to find the right way ? where will the bus stop and open its doors so that people can get out ? ’ said professor @entity23 , the committee 's secretary			2
‘ there are similar problems in the cell , to find the right way between the different organelles and out to the surface of the cell			0
’ professor @entity3 said he was woken up at 1am by the chairman of the prize committee and was still suffering from jetlag			2
' i was n't thinking too straight			0
i did n't have anything elegant to say , ' he said in the 1970s , professor @entity3 discovered a set of genes that were required for vesicle transport , while professor @entity1 revealed in the 1980s and 1990s how proteins dock with their target membranes like two sides of a zip			1
also in the 1990s , dr @entity4 found out how vesicles release their cargo with precision			2
‘ this is not an overnight thing			0
most of it has been accomplished and developed over many years , if not decades , ’ professor @entity1 told the @entity52 asked if the @entity6 might change his work or funding , he said : ‘ i honestly do n't know			1
it 's a new experience			0
’ professor @entity1 said he lost grant money for the work recognised by the @entity6 committee , but he will now reapply , hoping the @entity6 will make a difference in receiving funding			1
the medicine prize kicked off this year 's @entity6 announcements			1
the awards in physics , chemistry , literature , peace and economics will be announced by other prize juries this week and next			0
each prize is worth 8 million @entity141 kronor ( $ 1.2 million )			0
‘ these discoveries have had a major impact on our understanding of how cargo is delivered with timing and precision within and outside the cell , ’ the committee said			2
professor @entity1 and professor @entity3 won the @entity150 for their research in 2002 - an award often seen as a precursor of a @entity6			1
established by @entity141 industrialist @entity154 , the @entity6 have been handed out by award committees in @entity156 and @entity157 since 1901			2
the winners always receive their awards on december 10 , the anniversary of @entity154 's death in 1896			0
last year 's medicine award went to @entity164 's @entity163 and @entity166 's @entity165 for their contributions to stem cell science .			0

@entity2 @entity1 and @entity3 and @entity5 - born @entity4 won the 2013 @entity6 in medicine
they discovered how hormones and enzymes are transported in cells
their findings have given scientists a better understanding of diseases including diabetes , epilepsy and of disorders of the immune system
*hhoped* their research on ' vesicle traffic ' - the transport system of our cells - will lead to the development of new treatments for diabetes and epilepsy
