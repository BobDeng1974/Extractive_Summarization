by @entity0 published : 16:52 est , 29 january 2013 updated : 03:28 est , 31 january 2013 fireworks have exploded at @entity2 after new boss @entity3 hired and fired six big names in his first two days in the job			2
the first departure was political power couple @entity7 , the veteran political analyst , and his wife @entity10 , who have been with @entity2 since 2005			1
@entity2 network 's managing editor @entity11 then announced that he was going to quit as it emerged @entity15 's @entity14 was coming over to start a new morning show			1
@entity18 's @entity17 will also be leaving and will reportedly be heading to @entity19 , which recently fired @entity20			1
shake - up : @entity2 's new boss @entity3 , pictured left , has hired and fired six big names in his first two days in the job			1
however , the former editor of @entity27 's @entity26 , @entity28 , right , will keep his job but perhaps the biggest news of all is that the voice of @entity32 will once again speak the ' this is @entity2 ' greeting			1
the @entity34 nominee and voice of @entity36 has not been featured on the network for years but @entity3 asked that it be brought back on monday to coincide with president @entity40 's inauguration - also his first day in the job			0
it also appears that the former editor of @entity27 's @entity26 , @entity28 , will remain in his position as host of @entity45 , which he began hosting on 17 january 2011			0
the changes show just how serious @entity3 is about turning @entity2 around , but for so much to happen so soon has raised eyebrows			2
his actions also leave huge questions over others whose fate rests in his hands , namely @entity53 who wants to leave @entity54 for @entity2			0
another who will be feeling anxious is @entity57 , who currently hosts the @entity2 morning show ' @entity59 , ' which has struggled in the ratings despite being critically applauded			1
gone : the first departure was political power couple @entity7 , right , the veteran political analyst , and his wife @entity10 , left , who have been with @entity2 since 2005 co-anchors : @entity14 , left , will reportedly be paired with @entity66 , right , who currently hosts her prime time @entity2 show ' @entity69 ' @entity57 faces being ousted for @entity14 who will reportedly be paired with @entity66 , who currently hosts her prime time @entity2 show ' @entity69			1
' getting @entity14 , the son of @entity72 governor @entity71 , is quite a coup for @entity2 as he is a former anchor on @entity15 's @entity74 and is extremely experienced			1
but @entity57 will now have to renegotiate her role and try to avoid being put on the dreaded ' special assignment ' duty which will see her consigned to graveyard slots and obscurity			0
a @entity2 spokesman said : ' @entity82 is very important to the network , and we 're discussing various options with her			0
' @entity87 's firing seems less controversial			0
he claimed that he was ' completely cool ' with being axed and that it was to do with the fact he lives in @entity91 and not @entity92			0
fate unclear : it 's not clear whether @entity53 , right , will be able to leave @entity54 for @entity2 and @entity57 , right , who currently hosts the @entity2 morning show ' @entity59 , ' could be out switch : @entity17 , left , is out , but @entity32 , right , is rehired for the @entity2 jingle he told @entity98 : ' i was told that they wanted the contributors to be more available -- essentially , closer to @entity92			1
i 'm not always available , i do n't live there			0
' @entity10 told @entity98 in an email : ' agree with everything @entity104 said			0
' i loved my time in and out at @entity2 and more , the many lifelong friendships made there			0
' @entity11 , a former @entity106 editor , left with a barb and sent out an email to staff saying that he stepped aside because @entity3 has what he called ' forceful ideas			2
' gone : @entity2 's managing editor @entity11 has resigned he then tried to smooth things over and said : ' for him to succeed , i believe he deserves his own team and management structure and the freedom to communicate one clear vision to the staff			1
' i have shared that conclusion with him and he has agreed to let me step down as managing editor and move on from @entity2			2
@entity3 will in fact take over @entity11 's role overseeing editorial content at @entity2 and there will no new managing editor appointed			1
@entity3 said in a statement : ' i want to thank @entity11 for his service at @entity2			2
we are grateful for his contributions and wish him the best in the future			0
' right - leaning @entity17 has been with @entity2 since 2010 when he started as a contributor on @entity134 , @entity135 , which has already been axed , before becoming a contributor across the network			2
the worst affected by the switch seems to be his daughter and on his @entity18 blog he wrote : ' when i told my 7 year old i had decided to leave , she laid on the sofa for an hour crying that she 'd never see @entity143 again			0
' he also wrote that even though he was not an ' easy fit ' at @entity2 and that the first month was ' tumultuous , ' he was grateful for the chance to ' learn to be friends with people who i disagreed with			0
' under @entity3 's orders , @entity2 has already lured @entity15 's @entity150 to host an afternoon show on politics and @entity153 has been brought in to co-host early start from 5am to 7am			1
@entity3 was hired from @entity54 to shake up @entity2 after it suffered its worst rating slump in 21 years last summer .			2

political power couple @entity7 and his wife @entity10 were the first departures
@entity2 's managing editor @entity11 announced his plans to quit after @entity15 's @entity14 was hired for a new morning show
@entity18 's @entity17 will also be leaving and will reportedly be heading to @entity19
