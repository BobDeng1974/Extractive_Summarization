there were calls today to shut down the @entity3 service which is thought to have played a key role in helping mobilise looters involved in the riots across @entity7			1
@entity8 , a technology journalist and digital adviser to @entity10 , said it was ' unbelievable ' that the @entity3 service had not been disabled			1
messages on the service , along with posts on @entity14 , helped spread the locations of riots like wildfire and brought hordes of teenagers together to attack neighbourhoods throughout the weekend			1
@entity23 : smash and grab - a man jump kicks a store front window to get in and loot @entity23 : looters queue to get in to a convenience store to get hold of its goods @entity23 : hooded thieves take what they can from inside the store the messenger service on @entity3 handsets , an instant , cheap and safe form of communication , helped galvanise looters across @entity7 and nationwide over the weekend			1
the @entity3 itself is now the smartphone favoured by young people in this country , and is used by a massive 37 per cent of @entity44 teens			1
unlike social networks like @entity47 and @entity14 , messages sent through @entity3 can not be traced back to the sender 's phone			1
for the majority of teens with @entity53 , @entity50 has replaced regular sms messages which still cost around 10p each to send			1
@entity3 @entity44 were forced to deny weekend reports that they planned to disable the service			1
@entity57 , the firm behind @entity3 and @entity3 , instead said they would ‘ engage with the authorities ’ following the riots			1
today , mr @entity8 described the @entity3 service as ' text messaging with steroids ' , as @entity63 itself denied reports it had planned to disable the messenging service			1
mr @entity8 had tweeted last night : ' it is unbelievable that @ @entity67 is not shutting down @entity3 right now			1
' he told the @entity69 programme this morning : ' mobile phones have become weaponised in their capability of spreading information about where to target next			2
' there is evidence that @entity3 is an encrypted , very secure , safe , fast , cheap , easy way for disaffected urban youths to spread messages for their next target			1
' it 's like text messaging with steroids - you can send messages to hundreds of people and once it 's gone from your phone it can not be traced back to you			1
' @entity3 @entity44 had to deny reports over the weekend that it planned to shut down the messenging service			1
the firm instead tweeted that it would help the authorities with their investigation			2
mr @entity8 said police need to communicate with phone firms like @entity3 to help anticipate future disturbances			1
he added : ' @entity3 itself has said these messages are very hard to trace			1
obviously there is going to have to be some kind of communication between the police and companies like @entity3 to try to get the information befre the riots happen '			1
mr @entity8 has since removed the tweet from his @entity14 feed and qualified his comments on the today programme by adding that ' you could not shut down @entity3 because information would still be rooted around '			1
young looters were accused of an opportunistic ‘ @entity113 ’ motivated by nothing other than greed			2

claims that rampant lawlessness was motivated by the death of @entity124 at the hands of police was quickly exposed as a lie			2
some of those involved in attacks on stores in @entity131 , @entity132 and @entity133 were barely old enough to be arrested			2
