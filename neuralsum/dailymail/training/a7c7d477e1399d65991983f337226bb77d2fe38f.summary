one source said : ‘ @entity5 can literally do what it likes			1
’ under fire : @entity5 began door - to - door deliveries two years ago to add to the chaos , people who find letters dumped or wrongly delivered by @entity5 typically put them into a @entity3 postbox			1

@entity50 , a mother of two from @entity52 , west @entity16 , says she missed two important hospital letters because of failings by @entity5			1
one related to her 20 - month - old daughter @entity55 , who was born with a hole in her heart			0
the 48 - year - old knew something was amiss only when a letter arrived from @entity61 asking why she had not turned up to an appointment			0
she said : ‘ when i phoned the hospital , which has been fantastic , they said it happens all the time			0
‘ it is such a waste of hospital appointments			0

@entity24 was walking her two dogs by the @entity93 in @entity27 , north @entity16 , when she spotted a pile of around 250 letters under a bush			2
over the next 12 days , she telephoned @entity5 repeatedly – about eight or nine times – to urge them to come and pick up the mail			1
but the pile of letters remained where she had first spotted them			2
she was told by one worker at @entity5 the bushes were too ‘ thorny ’ to tackle			1
she became so frustrated she went into the bushes herself , put all the letters into a bag and called @entity5 again to pick them up , which they did			1

i see items of mail strewn in the street or thrown on doorsteps			2
‘ i see @entity5 postmen taking short cuts			2
i have them asking me directions and the whereabouts of certain streets			0
‘ all this astounds me and even saddens me as i have always taken pride in my own standards of service			0
‘ worse still , there is the notion held by many of my customers that the decrease in service and standards is down to me			0
’ a @entity5 spokesman said : ‘ we of course apologise for the disruption and distress caused by non-delivery of a letter by @entity5			2
‘ however , sometimes human nature means that we can not always live up to the standards we set ourselves and where there are issues with service quality , we will take the necessary action to resolve the issues to the satisfaction of our clients			0
’ @entity3 lost its monopoly on all postal deliveries in january 2006			0

but that doorstep job is now also being done by @entity5 , meaning households can have two deliveries a day			2
