@entity0 wants @entity2 ’s players to wreck @entity5 ’s @entity4 derby farewell and banish their own wretched record in this famous fixture			1
@entity2 have beaten @entity8 only four times since the turn of the millennium			1
their last win was in october 2010 , a run in all competitions that stretches nine matches , so recent form makes @entity18 ’ side favourites to ensure @entity5 ’s 33rd derby appearance is a successful one			1
@entity18 wryly observed that @entity21 would probably be glad to see the back of @entity5 , who will join @entity24 in the summer , but @entity0 feels @entity2 ’s players are ready to inject some momentum into their campaign			1
@entity5 leads the way as @entity8 train at @entity29 on thursday morning @entity5 will likely play in his last @entity4 derby at @entity31 on saturday evening @entity32 : games - 29 , @entity33 - 16 , drawn - 9 , lost - 4 , win % - 55.1 , @entity35 - 9 , @entity36 - 4 , @entity37 - 3 , @entity39 cards - 2 cup : games - 3 , @entity33 - 1 , drawn - 1 , lost - 1 , win % - 33.3 % , @entity35 - 1 , @entity36 - 0 , @entity37 - 0 , @entity39 cards - 0 victory at @entity42 last saturday was @entity2 ’s first since december 15 and @entity0 hopes that will prove to be a turning point			1
the @entity2 manager is aware of the emotion surrounding @entity5 but hopes he leaves @entity31 with a defeat			1
‘ there is going to be a lot of talk about @entity5 but the only thing that matters to us is to try to use this as a springboard for our season , ’ said the @entity48			1
‘ we picked up a very important win last weekend			2
the derby comes at the perfect moment for us			2
it can kick - start our season after the good moment we are sharing			2
‘ if you want to grow as a team you need a strong rival and a strong rivalry			2
we had that last season			2
i ’m not too concerned about the record for the last 20 years			2
i ’m more concerned about what the record is going to be in the next 20 years			2
’ @entity0 will be hoping to ruin what could potentially be @entity5 's final @entity4 derby @entity5 will be playing in his last @entity4 derby unless they meet in the @entity74 the build - up to this game is not entirely settled for @entity0 , who is ready to take a chance on the hamstrung @entity78			1
@entity79 has cast doubt on his future at @entity31 and suggested he may leave in the summer			1
@entity82 were keen on signing @entity79 in january but never made a bid			0
the @entity84 international has never said he wants to leave but , with 18 months left on his contract , he feels he is approaching the stage where he has to review his situation			0
‘ i like it over here but i feel ready for a new challenge , ’ said @entity79			0
‘ i dream of playing in the @entity94 next season , with @entity2 or with another club			1
i just have to see after the season			0
‘ do n’t forget , the 2015 @entity74 winners will qualify for the following season ’s @entity94			0
i like the @entity32 but @entity98 tempts me			1
@entity99 have enquired , but there was no offer			0
’ @entity78 could be risked by @entity0 as he recovers from a hamstring injury @entity79 has cast doubt on his future at @entity31 and suggested he may leave in the summer for @entity8 , the build - up to this fixture has been relatively smooth and confidence is high following the dramatic @entity108 win at @entity109			1
@entity18 ’s main decision is whether to start @entity111 or use the @entity113 striker from the bench			0
‘ he is not far away from starting , he is really champing at the bit , ’ said @entity18			0
‘ but we want to make sure he is going to be available now for the rest of the season			0
if the timing is not quite right it can hurt us			0
‘ his appetite to play is there , which is great			0
i need to speak with my staff and @entity111 and make a decision			0
it is difficult because these are games that we want to win , so it is hard if someone only needs 30 or 45 minutes			0

@entity5 could be set for final @entity4 derby on saturday
@entity0 hopes his players will wreck @entity5 's day
@entity8 face @entity2 at @entity31 in the @entity32
