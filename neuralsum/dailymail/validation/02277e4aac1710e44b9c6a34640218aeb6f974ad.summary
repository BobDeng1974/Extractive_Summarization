a domestic treble is a marathon rather than a sprint			2
yet @entity3 are closer to their promised land after routing the @entity5 in @entity8 football ’s answer to the six - day war			1
by 5pm on saturday , @entity10 were worn out			2
as punch drunk as a flabby heavyweight leaning against the ropes in the 14th round			2
exhausted — mentally and physically — by three losses in a week to a side with more depth , energy and firepower			1
the @entity21 team fancied their chances after holding on for a 1 - 1 @entity23 draw with nine men a fortnight ago			1
then @entity3 won the @entity25			1
and followed it with a thumping 4 - 0 victory in last wednesday ’s @entity23 replay			1
@entity29 celebrates with his team - mates after giving @entity3 a three - goal lead before half - time @entity29 taps home from close range as @entity3 record comfortable victory against @entity10 battered and bruised , @entity10 were gone then			1
long before they found themselves three goals down in the first half of this league match			1
the heat , light and fury which bred six red cards , three penalties and running feuds in the previous meetings had gone			2
@entity49 told , @entity3 and @entity10 met four times in two weeks			1
by the end , @entity52 ’s team were pleased the ordeal was over			2
the same might be said of the title race			2
in saturday ’s early game , @entity56 shipped two points in @entity59			2
the @entity61 equaliser came from the grandson of former @entity64 chairman @entity63			2
proof , if it were needed , that this was @entity3 ’s week			1
‘ it ’s been a great week , ’ said defender @entity67			2
‘ we know that , but we don ’ t want to look at what we ’ve done			2
we want to look forwards and that means the next game			2
that ’s more important than what we ’ve already done			2
‘ every game counts in the league and we want to keep going			0
from now until the end of the season , we want to keep doing our best , so we can defend our title and get to the @entity83			0
then we can see if the @entity84 is still possible			0
’ @entity85 struck to make it 2 - 0 to @entity88 's side after 33 minutes at @entity89 on saturday the @entity23 looks the last substantial hurdle			1
@entity91 , an awkward opponent , await in the semi-final on april 19			0
thereafter it is @entity95 or @entity96 in the @entity25			0
‘ it ’s an enjoyable place to be at the moment because everything is working well for us , ’ said @entity67			0
‘ i think , right now , it would take a lot of effort from another team to stop us			0
‘ @entity3 are playing at a top level			1
it ’s difficult for others to withstand what we have right now			0
@entity85 is congratulated by his team - mates after doubling the home side 's lead ‘ we have a huge squad and everyone is in their best form			1
it ’s difficult for the manager to pick his starting line - up			1
there ’s a lot of competition in the squad and that makes us better			0
’ there was nothing boastful in the way the @entity127 said this			0
he was merely stating a bald truth			0
for the fourth meeting with @entity10 in a fortnight , @entity88 replaced his entire front four			1
@entity134 , @entity135 , @entity136 and @entity137 made way for @entity85 , @entity139 , @entity140 and @entity141			1
@entity141 and @entity140 were @entity10 ’s star players until they were sold to @entity3 for £ 2million in january			1
@entity141 opened the scoring against his former club to set up victory for @entity3 once again , @entity147 chairman @entity146 had cause to ponder if it was worth it when @entity141 smashed a superb opening goal in 16 minutes , accepting a simple @entity67 pass and winding up for a swerving left - foot shot from fully 25 yards			1
as a former @entity10 player , his reluctance to celebrate was understandable			0
why @entity85 did likewise after doubling the lead in 33 minutes with a looping , deflected shot into the top corner was harder to work out			1
by then , @entity3 were playing a training game			1
a flat affair , given the ill feeling of the previous encounters , the home support could barely even bring themselves to boo @entity164			0
there was a brief flash of the old enmity when @entity168 was lucky to escape a red card for a wild , scything tackle on @entity141 on the stroke of half - time			1
if a yellow was a lenient punishment , @entity3 added to the penalty by scoring a third when @entity176 thumped @entity139 ’s low free - kick towards goal before @entity29 intercepted and cheekily back heeled into the net for 3 - 0			1
@entity141 ( left ) celebrates his goal with @entity139 during the @entity182 match the @entity183 has found a rich vein of form and , as with @entity176 , the @entity3 support should enjoy him while they can			1
@entity10 came close just once , when substitute @entity187 had a dipping , long - range effort tipped over the bar by @entity191			1
in truth , the visitors looked utterly demoralised by then			0
‘ i thought we were soft in the first half and we accepted things , ’ said @entity52			2
‘ so i told them i was disappointed in that			0
i was a bit angry at half - time about belief and not just pride , but in terms of doing things and not feeling sorry for themselves			1
‘ in the second half , we did that			2
we rolled up our sleeves , though it could be argued that @entity3 took their feet off the gas			1
’ they could afford to conserve their energies			0
only three times in @entity3 ’s 127 - year history have the club won a @entity84 and they are now tantalisingly close to a fourth			1
‘ i never allow myself to think about the @entity84 , ’ parried @entity67			0
‘ none of us do			0
‘ the most important thing for the team is to go game by game and that ’s what the manager wants			0
we take it as it comes			0
‘ we do n’t put anything in our heads			0
the important thing is to play hard and prepare			0
everyone wants to beat @entity3			1
‘ it ’s important that we ’re calm and work to the tactics the manager wants us to play			0
‘ we need to have one spirit , one heart			0
we have good momentum right now and i think we have delivered what the manager expected			0
‘ but we ’re not there yet , so we have to keep pushing in training			0
every time we play a game , he wants us to improve , so that ’s a challenge he has given to us			2
’ a popular whipping @entity245 when things go wrong , it ’s worth recording that ambrose himself has improved of late			0
the @entity250 sang his name on saturday , prompting a wry chuckle from a player who seems a little safer at right - back than centre - half			1
‘ the @entity3 supporters are the best in the world , ’ said the defender , ‘ i will give them credit for that			1
‘ sometimes it ’s unfair if i get criticism but that ’s football			0
we ’re a team , not individuals			0
‘ if a mistake happens , you just have to get on with it , work harder and make sure you correct the mistake			0
’ of late , @entity88 ’s @entity3 have managed not only to correct their early season mistakes , but eradicate them			1
as the final mile of the marathon approaches , they are pacing themselves nicely .			0

@entity141 opened the scoring for @entity3 after 16 minutes
@entity85 doubled the hosts lead 12 minutes before half - time
@entity29 made it three for @entity88 's side on stroke of half - time
