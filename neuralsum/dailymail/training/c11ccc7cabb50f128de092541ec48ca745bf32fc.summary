' @entity143 - @entity24 replaced @entity144 as the official supplier of kit to the @entity143 in 2012 in a five - year deal that is the most lucrative in @entity122 sport			1
and there is still an opportunity for @entity0 to do a further fashion brand tie - up , with @entity153 company @entity152 , who sponsor @entity156 champion @entity155 , understood to have been in talks			2
but once again the fans will be hit in the pocket			0
