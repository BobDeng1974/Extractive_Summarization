motorists will get new ‘ mini-motorways ’ as part of a £ 15billion overhaul of the nation ’s highways			2
busy a-roads will be revamped – with roundabouts and traffic lights stripped out – to cut delays and transform them into ‘ mile - a - minute expressways ’			1
details , included in a strategy by the @entity13 presented to @entity14 , also include new slip roads to make the roads flow and banning slow moving vehicles such as tractors and bicycles			1
new roads : busy a-roads will be revamped – with roundabouts and traffic lights stripped out – to cut delays and transform them into ‘ mile - a - minute expressways ’ up to 18 a-roads are likely to be transformed in the first tranche with seven more to follow			1
the strategy document says : ‘ our ambition for the next 25 years is to revolutionise our roads			2
’ our busiest a-roads will become expressways , providing improved standards of performance , with technology to manage traffic and mile - a - minute speeds			1
‘ users of motorways know they can expect a broadly consistent standard from the whole of their road , and that this ensures they have a safe , free - moving journey			1
’ but it notes : ‘ the same is not true of a-roads , where piecemeal upgrades have often resulted in inconsistency and substandard stretches of the road that are often less safe and a regular cause of congestion			2
‘ by 2040 , we want to have transformed the most important of these routes into expressways : a-roads that can be relied upon to be as well - designed as motorways and which are able to offer the same standard of journey to users			1
’ ' vital part of the long - term economic plan ' : transport secretary @entity61 ( pictured ) said the government is ' investing £ 15billion in the biggest upgrade to @entity65 ’s strategic roads in a generation ' these will be ‘ largely or entirely dual carriageway roads ’ that are ‘ safe , well - built and resilient to delay			1
the first group of nine expressways is expected to include the @entity71 and @entity72 from the junction with the @entity74 in @entity75 to @entity76			0
the @entity78 north of @entity79 , which motorists have long campaigned to be made into a motorway , is another , as is the @entity83 from @entity84 to @entity85			0
these will also link with up to 400 miles of ‘ smart motorways ’ where hard shoulders are used at peak times to reduce jams			0
a dual carriageway is planned for ‘ the entire @entity71 from the @entity74 to the @entity95 at @entity96 ’ , as well as building a tunnel as the road passes @entity94			0
there will also be a new bypass on the @entity99 at @entity100 together with improvements at @entity102 and @entity103 in @entity104			0
also featuring will be construction of the @entity107 link road together with overtaking and safety improvements and duelling the @entity109 to improve @entity111 connectivity			0
a range of duelling and junction improvement schemes on the @entity117 / @entity116 corridor supporting growth at @entity119 , @entity120 , @entity121 and @entity122 is also planned			0
they will be built so that ‘ traffic on the main road can pass over or under roundabouts without stopping ’			0
the strategy document seen by the @entity128 says : ‘ an expressway will be able to provide a high - quality journey to its users			0
‘ most expressways should be able to offer mile a minute journeys throughout the day , particularly outside of urban areas			1
’ the @entity13 has presented the @entity135 to @entity14 ahead of it being transformed on april 1 into the new private sector roads operator called @entity65			2
ministers say the new government - owned company marks ‘ a step change ’ in how @entity65 ’s roads are maintained and managed and will be responsible for delivering more than £ 15billion of investment by 2021			1
it will have longer - term funding to be able to plan ahead and invest in skills and equipment to speed up essential work			0
a @entity149 spokesman said : ‘ the move is part of a radical package of road reform that is expected to save the taxpayer at least £ 2.6billion over the next ten years			1
’ transport secretary @entity61 added : ‘ infrastructure is a vital part of this government ’s long term economic plan to secure a better future for this country , that is why we are investing £ 15billion in the biggest upgrade to @entity65 ’s strategic roads in a generation			2
’ ‘ the creation of @entity65 will mean better value for money , improved customer satisfaction , more road capacity , improved safety and a better quality of service for millions of people who use the strategic road network every day			0
