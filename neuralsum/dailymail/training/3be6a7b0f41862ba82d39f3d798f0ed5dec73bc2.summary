instead , the area - described as an ' @entity20 's cave ' of natural resources - was simply handed to the former @entity11 nation by the @entity23 on the @entity24 of the @entity25 , a treaty body run by the @entity26 , on march 15			1

@entity6 ambitions : two weeks ago , president @entity92 announced the creation of a ' united system of naval bases for ships and next - generation submarines in the @entity6 ' to defend @entity0 's interests there ' it makes sense to create a body similar in status to the state commission with broad authority , as it was previously done for the @entity120			1
