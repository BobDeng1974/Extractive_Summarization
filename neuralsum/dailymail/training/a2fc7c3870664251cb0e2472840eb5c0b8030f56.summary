a forgotten @entity1 manuscript which could be worth up to £ 10million has been discovered in a @entity3 scrapbook in a @entity5 's archive			1
it has been hailed an important historical find in the week the four original copies were brought together for the 800th anniversary of the charter which established the principle of the rule of law			1
the parchment , discovered in @entity15 's archive , was ripped and a third had been lost , but experts were able to establish it was issued by @entity18 in 1300			1
speaking from @entity19 , professor @entity20 , of the @entity21 , who authenticated the document , said : ' it is a fantastic discovery which comes in the week that the four other known versions were brought together at the @entity26			0
' @entity48 dr @entity47 discovered the historical document at the @entity51 history and library centre in @entity53			1
it is one of only 24 editions of the @entity1 in known existence around the world			1
professor @entity20 said the fact @entity15 had its own @entity1 means that is may have been issued more widely than previously thought to at least 50 cathedral towns and ports			1
' and it is very likely that there are one or two out there somewhere that no one has spotted yet , ' he said			0
more than 40,000 people entered a public ballot for the chance to see the four surviving original @entity1 copies , but only 1,215 will get the opportunity the medieval history expert said the value of the sandwich edition could be up to £ 10million			1
the first @entity1 was agreed between @entity32 and the barons in 1215 and was reissued on many occasions			1
dr @entity47 found the document in december when he was asked to look up a copy of the town 's original @entity79			1
it was found next to the charter in a @entity3 scrapbook and its high value comes from the fact it also comprises the @entity79			1
there is only one other such pair in the world , owned by @entity89 , @entity90			0
it is understood that @entity15 does not intend to sell its @entity1 but instead is hoping to benefit from its potential as a tourist attraction			1
@entity94 , mayor of @entity95 , said : ' on behalf of @entity95 , i would like to say that we are absolutely delighted to discover that an original @entity1 and original @entity79 , previously unknown , are in our ownership			2
@entity32 signing the @entity1 reluctantly by @entity99 , @entity100 , which was painted in 1945 ' to own one of these documents , let alone both , is an immense privilege given their international importance			2
' perhaps it is fitting that they belong to a town where @entity108 lived , who proposed in his pamphlet @entity111 a @entity112 for what were then the @entity115 colonies , ' answering to what is called the @entity1 of @entity38 ... securing freedom and property to all men , and ... the free exercise of religion '			2
' through the @entity122 , continuing in the @entity123 , @entity1 still underpins individual liberties worldwide			2
' to own such a document - and the @entity79 - is an honour and a great responsibility			0
' the four known 1215 editions are from @entity129 , @entity130 and two held at the @entity31			2
they were brought together for a one - day exhibition at the @entity31 @entity133 for a crowd of 1,215 chosen by a public ballot			0
the first @entity1 was agreed by @entity32 ( left ) in 1215 , pictured ( right ) is 13th century copy which sold for £ 10million speaking of the exhibition , the lord speaker , @entity137 , said : ' @entity1 established the principle of the rule of law and equality before the law ; for 800 years we have been influenced by its contents and it remains one of the most important political documents in the world , with countries such as the @entity115 , @entity148 , @entity149 and @entity150 tracing constitutional influences back to @entity1			1
' the speaker , @entity152 @entity152 mp , said : ' over the past eight centuries the public and their @entity133 have shaped society and changed the way we live our lives			0
' the sealing of the @entity1 in 1215 and the @entity161 parliament of 1265 marked the start of the journey towards modern rights and representation , paving the way for the @entity167 and democracy as we know it today			1
' the parchment , which was issued by @entity18 in 1300 , is the final version of @entity1 and three of its clauses remain on the statute books today			1
these include the defence of the church , the protection of the @entity176 and the right to trial by jury			0
the first @entity1 was drafted by the archbishop of @entity184 and agreed by @entity32 on 15 june 1215 to make peace with a group of rebel barons			1
it was reissued and reaffirmed on many occasions in subsequent years			0
eight centuries after @entity32 sent copies of the first @entity1 across his kingdom , just four remain			2
two of the survivors are kept at the @entity31 , were they lay alongside the other two copies which are usually found at @entity195 and @entity196			0
the two @entity31 copies came from the private library of the mp and and antique collector sir @entity200 , whose collection of preserved documents laid the foundation for the library back in 1753			0
one of these manuscripts was almost destroyed in a fire in 1731 , suffering some damage but remaining largely intact			0
. staff at the @entity209 in the early 19th century also made it harder to read by using outdated techniques to flatten and mount the historic document			0
the @entity129 @entity1 has been at the @entity130 since the 13th century			2
it may have been deposited there by @entity214 , @entity215 and one of @entity32 ’s chief advisers , or it may have come from @entity218 , who supervised the building of the @entity130 from the 1220s			0
the manuscript has rarely left the @entity129 in its 800 year history			0
the @entity195 @entity1 has belonged to the @entity130 for 800 years			2
it is arriving at the @entity31 directly from the @entity115 after going on display in @entity224 and @entity225 , where over 200,000 people viewed it			0
on its return to @entity195 , the manuscript will move from the @entity130 into a new permanent home at the ‘ @entity230 ’ in nearby @entity231			0
