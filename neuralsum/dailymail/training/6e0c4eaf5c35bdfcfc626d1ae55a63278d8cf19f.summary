a patient left worried for his own nutrition has revealed the pitiful meals he was given while being cared for at a new hospital			1
@entity4 spent eight days at @entity5 in @entity6 after having an operation on his feet			1
every day , the 29 - year - old was given tiny portions of food at the £ 430million facility , including a roast dinner with just one floret of broccoli			1
@entity4 was given this tiny roast dinner with just one floret of broccoli , two potatoes , two pieces of cauliflower and fatty beef at @entity5 the 29 - year - old was dismayed with the small portions he was given			1
this half - plate of chilli con carne was one of the meals he received when the photographer asked for a different topping on a baked potato , he was given this small cheese sandwich instead the photographer has shared pictures of the dishes he was served up by hospital staff every day to expose the hospital which belongs to @entity38 - one of the first in the country to win a catering award			1
' in a way , it should n't have been sent from the kitchen			2
it was n't great service			2
my family were bringing me food from home in a @entity53			2
' the food was horrible			2
it was not great at all			0
to be quite honest , i think a dog would n’t eat what they were serving			1
' among the meals he was given was a pathetic roast dinner with just one head of broccoli , two small pieces of cauliflower , two potatoes and fatty beef			1
on another day he was given a half - plate portion of chilli con carne with rice			1
' there was no balance in the food , especially in the calorie intake			2
there was no way we were getting what we needed			0
' there was even a member of staff who said they were concerned			0
' the portions were so tiny			2
i have a two year old girl and she would eat more than that			1
' the worst meal i got was the sunday roast			1
the meat was fatty and chewy and it tasted like tinned potatoes			0
' i ordered some cheese and biscuits one night			0
there were just two crackers and a travel pack of cheese			0
' i just had these two crackers with a tiny bit of cheese between them			2
mr @entity4 said not even his two - year - old daughter would be satisfied with the food he was given following an operation on his feet the hospital ( pictured ) belongs to @entity38 which has been given a silver award in food catering ' one meal tasted like they have tipped a whole tin of seasoning on			1
' @entity5 opened in may this year as part of the @entity111			1
after almost 10 years of construction , the hospital was forced to cancel 180 operations before opening its doors due to a problem with its air conditioning			1
it is part of @entity38 which has a silver @entity121 catering award from the @entity122			0
but mr @entity4 claims the portion size was not the only thing wrong with the food			1
the new £ 430 million hospital @entity5 opened in may this year as part of the @entity111 ' one night there was jacket potato with pasta			1
i asked for beans or cheese instead but that ’s all they had			0
' ' they do n’t cater for everyone			0
that ’s how i ended up with a cheese sandwich one night			0
if you do n’t like the second choice you are left with a sandwich			0
' i have to go back to have plaster removed			0
' hopefully i wo n’t have to stay though and if so i ’ll take my own food			2
' @entity144 , director of facilities at @entity38 said : ' i would like to offer sincere apologies to mr @entity4			1
' we take great pride in our patient meals which contain high - quality ingredients , are nutritionally balanced and cooked in - house			2
' the photographs he took do not show the meals we would aspire to provide , particularly the portion size which is short of what it should be and is certainly not typical of what we serve			1
' we have spoken to the staff who serve meals on the ward mr @entity4 was treated to ensure they are fully aware of how they should serve the food and to re-iterate how much should be on the patients ’ plates			1
' we did try to address mr @entity4 ’ concerns directly with him but unfortunately he was discharged before our catering manager could talk to him			1
' if anyone has any concerns about their food whilst with us , we would ask that they talk to one of the ward staff so their concerns can be addressed immediately			0
' forty per cent of adult hospital patients and 15 per cent of children are malnourished on admission , half of these severely so , according to the malnutrition charity @entity180			2
the majority who depend on hospital food for all their nutrition continue to lose weight while in hospital , reflecting the inadequacy of current feeding policies			2
between 30 and 50 per cent of hospital food is wasted - and average food intakes are less than 75 per cent of that recommended , particularly among the elderly			1
guidance from the @entity194 ( @entity194 ) stipulates that adults of a healthy weight ( classed as nutritionally well ) should consume between 1,810 and 2,550 calories a day while in hospital			0
those classed as ' nutritionally vulnerable ' should be given between 2,250 - 2,625			0
hospitals should be following the following strict guidelines when it comes to food , according to the @entity194 protein is vital to recovery and building up muscle strength			0
the recommended amount is 1g for every kg of body weight / day and is based on a 60 - 75kg individual ( 60 - 75g protein / day )			0
the @entity194 guidelines state that the minimum protein content for any main meal i.e. a starter , dessert and a main course that is based on meat , fish , eggs , cheese , pulses or other vegetarian ingredient , must reach 15g			0
' on a menu where some desserts such as fruit or jelly may contribute negligible protein , the 15g minimum protein level will therefore need to be provided by the starter and main course			0
' in hot meal services , the judicious use of accompaniments such as dumplings and @entity237 puddings , vegetables such as peas and sweetcorn and / or suitable sauces e.g. parsley or cheese sauce may be required to balance the protein element of the meal			0
' the recommended daily menu and calorie count , according to a report by the @entity194			0
