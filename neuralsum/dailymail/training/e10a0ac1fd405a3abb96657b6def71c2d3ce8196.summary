by @entity0 published : 19:04 est , 1 may 2013 updated : 19:05 est , 1 may 2013 @entity1 was accused of a ‘ contemptuous ’ refusal to answer ‘ legitimate questions ’ after insisting he would make no further comments on an affair between a counsel to his inquiry and a barrister representing celebrities			1
the judge reacted with irritation to a letter from @entity15 mp @entity14 requesting further information about the relationship between @entity18 and @entity19			1
mr @entity14 , a parliamentary aide to health secretary @entity20 , is calling for a full investigation by the @entity22 , as a professional code of conduct suggests affairs between opposing lawyers should be avoided lest the perception be created of ‘ a danger of a breach of confidence or other conspiracy ’			1
questions have been raised about whether the affair between @entity18 and @entity19 tainted the findings of the @entity1 report mr @entity19 , who represented actor @entity36 and other celebrity victims of phone hacking , went on holiday to the romantic @entity41 island of @entity42 with ms @entity43 , a married mother of two , in august last year			1
the visit took place while the inquiry was being conducted , although the couple claim they simply discussed the ‘ possibility of a future relationship and decided against it ’			0
parliamentary aide @entity14 described @entity1 's dismissal of his request for information as ' contemptuous ' they say they changed their minds later and became a couple after the inquiry ended in november			2
in a letter to mr @entity14 yesterday , @entity1 flatly rejected any suggestion that his report into press standards may have been tainted by the relationship			1
the judge insisted that ‘ every finding of fact , every conclusion and every recommendation ’ in last year ’s report was his alone and that ms @entity43 had no influence over them			1
‘ you ask whether it is possible that [ ms @entity43 ] may have had an input into the inquiry ’s conclusions ... the answer is “ no ” , ’ he wrote			1
‘ ms @entity43 was second junior counsel to my inquiry and , throughout the process , undertook all of her work at the request and under the direction of either myself or @entity84 ... ‘ as for her impact , i repeat from my report : ... every finding of fact , every conclusion and every recommendation is mine alone			2
’ @entity1 added : ‘ i am aware that you have written to the @entity22 and it will be for the board , not me , to determine whether there has been any breach of the code of conduct			2
‘ in the meantime , i see no benefit in engaging in further public debate about the work of the inquiry or the integrity of its processes : i do not intend to comment on this matter further			0
’ standing firm : @entity1 said he plans to make no further comment on the matter mr @entity14 said @entity1 had ‘ contemptuously dismissed ’ proper questions			2
he said : ‘ @entity1 ’s response is highly unsatisfactory			0
in the past , the courts have rightly shown great humility and taken any perception of a conflict of interest or breach of confidence very seriously indeed			0
‘ @entity118 cases have been quashed where people assisting a judge are perceived to have a conflict of interest			0
instead , @entity1 has contemptuously dismissed perfectly legitimate questions about what work his counsel was doing , what access she might have had to confidential information , and what the nature of her relationship with @entity131 ’s barrister was during this time			1
‘ leaving these questions unanswered does n’t do the @entity134 or the legal profession any good			0
‘ i am frankly baffled as to why @entity1 has acted in this way			0
’ @entity1 was criticised after declining to take any questions from the media as he announced his findings last year .			0
