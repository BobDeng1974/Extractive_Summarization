by @entity0 published : 05:37 est , 4 december 2013 updated : 04:03 est , 5 december 2013 ever wondered what @entity1 really felt like when she fell down the rabbit hole ? one 24 - year - old can tell you exactly what the iconic children ’s book character experienced			1
@entity10 suffers from @entity1 ( @entity1 ) , a rare disorder which affects her sense of vision and perception , causing objects to seemingly grow and shrink around her			1
she realised that she had the condition , after seeing it feature in an episode of the hit television series ‘ @entity22 ’ and reading about it in a newspaper supplement			1
ms @entity10 , the deputy editor of popular website @entity35 , started to experience the strange hallucinations at the age of five			1
she said : ‘ when i was younger , i would suffer from attacks almost every other day and that was quite scary			0
what made it worse was that nobody knew what it was			0
’ @entity1 attacks can happen anywhere and at any time and last for about twenty minutes			1
ms @entity10 , whose father also experienced similar hallucinations , said : ‘ an attack gradually builds up on you			1
you feel like the room is shrinking in on you and that your body ’s becoming larger			1
‘ your arms and legs start to feel longer			0
things look further away or seem smaller than they are			0
everything feels exaggerated and movements feel faster and sudden			0
ms @entity10 started experiencing the hallucinations when she was five			1
as a child she had them most days but now it only happens a few times a year image shows a drawing of @entity1			1
ms @entity10 said : ' an attack gradually builds up on you			1
you feel like the room is shrinking in on you and that your body 's becoming larger			1
' ‘ it feels exactly how @entity1 did in the book - the way everything feels big or small and strangely out of proportion			1
i guess that ’s why the syndrome ’s named after it			0
’ ms @entity10 , from @entity78 , saw six psychologists - one of whom wrongly assumed she had epilepsy and another who told her that she would ‘ outgrow it ’ - before she was diagnosed with the syndrome last year			1
‘ i read about @entity1 in a small column in a newspaper and thought “ @entity89 , that ’s what i have ! ”			2
afterwards i started researching it more online and i then happened to watch an episode of @entity22 in which a patient was thought to have the disorder			2
for years doctors were unable to establish what was wrong with ms @entity10			2
one thought she was epileptic while another said she would ' outgrow it ' ms @entity10 was only diagnosed after seeing the condition featured on an episode of the hit television series ' @entity22 ' ( pictured ) ‘ i rang my dad and we could n’t believe that the weird thing we had both suffered from was a real thing and had a name			1
doctors had been baffled by me for years			0
’ after discovering her disorder , ms @entity10 went online to discuss her experiences and received numerous responses from fellow @entity1 sufferers across the globe			1
her condition has since improved and now only experiences attacks around five times a year , most frequently when she ’s about to sleep			2
she said : ‘ much more research should be done into @entity1			2
i do n’t think it ’s as rare as most psychologists seem to believe			0
ms @entity10 says she was amazed when she learnt her condition was a medically recognised syndrome ms @entity10 said : ' much more research should be done into @entity1			1
i do n't think it 's as rare as most psychologists seem to believe ' ‘ i ’ve spoken to sufferers from around the world and in some cases , their condition genuinely disturbs their lives			0
’ a spokesperson for @entity133 , a resource for people with the disorder , said : ‘ there is , as yet , no proven effective treatment for @entity1			2
‘ @entity1 is sometimes a frightening condition for the sufferer			2
if you suffer from it , please be assured that the symptoms themselves do not indicate that you are ‘ going mad ’ or have anything serious wrong with you			0
’ @entity1 ( @entity1 ) is a set of symptoms including the alteration of body image and the alteration of visual perception			2
it makes the sufferer feel as though parts of their body are changing size and as though the sizes of objects are changing			0
other symptoms include the feeling that time is moving too quickly or too slowly , a feeling that the ground is spongy under the feet and a distorted perception of sound			0
it is most common in children but some people also experience it later in life			0
symptoms most commonly occur at night			0
the cause is not know but the syndrome is thought to be associated with migraines , epilepsy and glandular fever			0
there is currently no known treatment for @entity1 other than to look for an underlying cause that can be treated			0

@entity10 was diagnosed with @entity1 after seeing it featured on an episode of the hit television series ' @entity22 '
she has experienced the hallucinations since she was five - they used to happen most days but now only occur about five times a year
each attack causes her to feel like the room she 's in is shrinking and her body is growing
