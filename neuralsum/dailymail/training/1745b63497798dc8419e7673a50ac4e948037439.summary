@entity9 was one of two babies who died in @entity11 from a strain of the chronic stomach bug			1
she was born ' very premature ' and contracted the infection while being cared for on a specialist ward			1
the second baby died in the community , but doctors suspect the child ’s mother had caught the infection at the hospital and passed it on at home			1
outbreak : two babies have died after contracting @entity25 and three other people are ill. health chiefs are investigating how the cross-infection occurred ( file pic ) both cases are centred on @entity31 in @entity11			1
@entity9 died after contracting the @entity5 strain , which is resistant to antibiotics and can cause serious problems for the ‘ vulnerable ’			2
her parents @entity35 and @entity36 are too upset to speak about their loss , but grandmother @entity39 , 66 , said : ' they are very distraught - they do n't know what is going on			2
' we have n't been given any information as to the cause of @entity9 's death			0
we 've only been told an inquiry is ongoing and they are investigating			0
' we need to know the answers of what took @entity49 away from us			0
' mrs @entity1 said the family was ' unaware ' of any link with the other baby and three adults who are also being treated for @entity5 at the hospital			1
@entity55 , chief executive of @entity56 said : ' the purpose of the review will be to ensure we have taken all reasonable measures to identify the cause of the cross infection			2
deaths : @entity31 in @entity11 , @entity63 , where baby @entity9 died			1
a second baby died ' in the community ' but health chiefs believe the cases are linked ' it will also ensure that the management of the infections in conjunction with @entity72 has been effective , and that the arrangements put in place for the ongoing care of mothers and babies are safe and appropriate			1
' this review is expected to commence after we have concluded our own investigation into the two cases of @entity5 cross infection			1
' dr @entity83 medical director of @entity85 : ' we can confirm there is no evidence of the infection spreading further , and reiterate that these appear to be isolated incidents which have been contained			2
' @entity91 's maternity unit is open as normal for full - term births			1
' the temporary precautionary neonatal unit restriction limiting routine admissions to babies over 36 weeks gestation is continuing , but this is under constant review and we anticipate lifting this restriction shortly			1
@entity100 chiefs at the @entity101 said they were aware of five cases of the infection over the past month			1
it said two of the cases of @entity5 – normally less serious than the food poisoning strain of @entity5 - are being investigated in the maternity and neonatal unit at @entity91			1
@entity9 was born in the hospital on october 31 but never went home after contracting the illness			2
she died on november 4			0
health officials yesterday said a new mother on a maternity ward had contracted the infection but is not seriously ill. a hospital spokesman said : ‘ @entity5 is most often found in the gastrointestinal tract but may cause urinary tract infections			1
‘ it is resistant to commonly used antibiotics such as penicillin , but can be treated			0
’ dr @entity83 , medical director , said : ‘ tests have confirmed that in one of these cases the @entity5 infection was contracted in the hospital			1
' sadly , this was a very premature baby who , despite the best efforts of staff , later died			1
‘ the cause of death of this baby is currently being investigated by the coroner			0
everyone involved with the unit and in the care of this baby deeply regret this tragic loss			2
’ dr @entity83 added : ‘ these appear to be isolated incidents which have been contained , and there is no evidence of the infection spreading further			2
‘ checks have been taken of patients , equipment and areas in the maternity - neonatal unit and no evidence of @entity5 has been found			1
the unit has an excellent record for hand hygiene and general infection control adherence			2
’ extra precautions have been taken at the hospital which include carrying out a ‘ deep clean ’ at the obstetric theatres and increasing cleaning in the neonatal and labour wards			0
the doctor said : ‘ as a precaution , we have temporarily restricted the neonatal unit to admissions for babies of 36 weeks and over gestation			1
' we would like to reassure expectant mothers due to give birth in @entity31 that the maternity unit is open as usual for full - term births			1
’ according to the @entity175 , there are between 2,000 and 2,500 cases of @entity5 every year in @entity177 , most of which affect the elderly			0
any concerned mothers - to - be are advised to speak to their midwife first but a helpline has also been set up on 0774 761 5627			0
what is @entity25 ? @entity25 is a type of bacterium found in the intestines of humans and other animals and forms part of the normal gut flora			0
however , some strains can cause serious food poisoning and infection			0
while most people are affected with short - term diarrhoea , e. coli bacteria can cause the bladder infection cystitis and more serious complications , such as haemolytic - uraemic syndrome ( @entity201 )			1
this is a serious disorder of the digestive system , which produces toxic substances that can get into the blood stream and cause kidney disease			0
where do the @entity5 bacteria come from ? most people carry harmless strains of @entity25 in their intestine			0
both these and the strains that cause diarrhoea come from contaminated food or water			0
it can also be passed from animals to people and person - to - person through hand to mouth			2
what about @entity223 ? the latest @entity5 outbreak involves the @entity223 strain - a milder strain than @entity226 which causes food poisoning			0
@entity223 infects around 30,000 people in @entity177 and @entity72 each year and causes no harm in most			2
however , it can cause infections in vulnerable people such as babies and the elderly and is difficult to treat as it is resistant to antibiotics			0
patients with the strain can develop urinary tract infections that in turn can develop into deadly septicaemia ( blood poisoning )			0
how do you stop @entity5 it spreading ? good hygiene is very important in preventing person - to person spread and small children should be supervised with hand washing after using the toilet and before @entity247 is always advisable to wash fruits and vegetables before you eat them			0
peeling or cooking fruit and vegetables can also remove germs			0
also be careful not to swallow water while swimming in lakes or ponds .			0
