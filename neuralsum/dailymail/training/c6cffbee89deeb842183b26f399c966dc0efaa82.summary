by @entity1 reporter published : 17:30 est , 19 september 2013 updated : 00:06 est , 20 september 2013 a group called @entity3 has launched a website where students can post photos of the most unappetizing lunch offerings from their schools			1
it is called @entity10 and , like all projects taken on by the non-profit , it aims to empower young people to make positive changes in the world			1
along with the pictures , grossed out teens can vent their frustration with sarcastic captions that sum up just what makes each dish so unpalatable			0
brain food ? a new website allows school kids nationwide to upload photos of their most unappetizing school lunches			1
this gruel was uploaded by a student at @entity29 in @entity30 mission : the site was started by @entity3 , a non-profit dedicated to empowering young people to make positive changes in the world those who visit the blog - style site can approve of , or condemn each photo via eat it or toss it buttons			1
according to @entity42 , who runs @entity10 , the idea for the project came from a study that sought to understand why students drop out of school			2
‘ the obvious reasons , like bad grades and needing to support their families with a job , came up , ’ @entity48 told today			0
‘ but we started realizing that nutrition in school plays a huge role in ability to perform			2
have you ever eaten a fried food lunch and felt the effects afterwards ? for some students , they have no choice but to feel that way after a meal			0
’ unappetizing : many examples , like this lunch from @entity67 in @entity68 , @entity69 with what appears to be pizza , are downright disgusting tossing your lunch : the site allows users to upload photos like these , and also to vote each photo as eat it or toss it tasty ! the uploader of this photo from @entity82 in @entity83 noted the light seasoning of human hair atop what may or may not be pizza @entity88 : many of the uploads come with sarcastic , though occasionally flattering , remarks about the food items from the students salty : part of the @entity97 's @entity96 , hunger - free kids initiative stipulates that high school lunches must contain less than 740 milligrams of sodium fatty : the @entity97 also stipulates that school lunches contain less fat than they once could @entity10 has received thousands of submissions in the week or so since it launched			1
and the photos have received a combined 30,000 votes			0
‘ we 've learned that young people care , ’ @entity48 says			0
‘ they want to see change , and up until now have n't known how to voice their opinions			0
’ users will be able to post photos and vote through november 15			0
once voting closes , @entity3 will compile the data and create infographic maps that show where the best and worst lunches in @entity117 are served			1
@entity118 n't : @entity42 , who runs @entity10 , fears that fattening , fried foods are compounding the problem of poor student performance in schools the funny captions hide a bitter truth about @entity117 school lunches			1
despite new legislation aimed at making them healthier , around two thirds of @entity117 school lunches exceed recommended fat content and most exceed recommended sodium content one potato , two potato ? what appear to be tater tots at left are actually chicken nuggets healthier : the @entity137 established new standards for all foods sold in schools with an emphasis on more veggies and fewer calories what 's being done in 2010 , the @entity97 instituted the @entity96 , @entity146			1
the initiative is a pet project of first lady @entity149 , who has made childhood obesity her signature issue			0
the new regulations have a calorie cap and require that school meals include only one portion of meat or protein			2
they also stipulate that milk be either skim or one percent fat and that bread be ‘ brown wheat			0
’ in an effort to curb obesity , carbohydrates like @entity165 fries may only be served in three - fourths of a cup portions and kids in elementary school — where the complaints mostly seem to originate — may only be served a total of 650 calories per meal			2
why it 's important the government estimates that around two thirds of school meals exceed the fat content limits			0
most lunches are believed to exceed the sodium limits			0
meanwhile , some 21 million students relied on school lunches as their primary meal of the day last year			1
and at least a third of @entity117 children and adolescents are overweight or obese , according to the @entity189			0
@entity42 , who heads up @entity10 , fears that @entity117 students are losing out in part because of fattening school lunches			1
' hard ham and cheese ' : this ham and cheese comes from an @entity198 high school hopeful : @entity48 hopes the @entity10 project will help improve school performance and alleviate the childhood obesity epidemic @entity203 all bad : not all of the photos are uploaded by students angry at the quality of their school lunches			1
some actually praise them , though the majority of votes are likely of the negative variety useful : @entity10 intends to take data it collects from the site and turn it into an infographic handout for schools and nutritionists			2

a non-profit called @entity3 aimed at empowering kids has created @entity10 so they can *showcase* the worst of school lunches in an effort to educate the public about what kids are eating
