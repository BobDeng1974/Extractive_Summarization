two years after a shocking doping scandal forced him from the charity he created , former elite cyclist @entity0 may start a new cancer foundation if he is not allowed to return to the iconic @entity5 brand			1
@entity0 , 42 , recently told reporters he was weighing his options as the people in charge of @entity5 consider his potential future involvement			1
he told the @entity11 that ' if i 'm not welcome ' he would likely either start a new foundation ' which is probably the most likely scenario , or just be willing and able to help , wherever i 'm asked			2
however chairman @entity19 said that a reconciliation was ' not on the table			0
' @entity0 was removed from the charity in november 2012 just one month after the @entity23 hit him with a lifetime competition ban and he was stripped of his seven @entity26 titles			1
he founded the @entity5 after his own battle with testicular cancer in 1997			1
based in his hometown of @entity31 , @entity32 , it 's raised more than an estimated $ 500 million			1
he claims to have used $ 7 million to $ 8 million of his own money to seed the foundation			1
@entity0 may start a new cancer foundation if he is not allowed to return to the iconic @entity5 brand @entity0 said that even the possibility of a return was shocking			1
' i was surprised by that			0
that was never the impression i 'd been given , ' @entity0 said			1
' to see the follow - up statement by the chairman , @entity19 , that was more in line with where i think they are			0
' that 's beyond my control			0
i ca n't force that issue			2
but what i can do ( is ) stay committed to the fight , stay committed to the cause			0
' @entity0 said he was still uncertain how he would respond to an invitation to return and that any answer would ' involve a lot of conversation			2
' ' i 'm a big believer in the whole ( author ) @entity60 theory of ' who 's on the bus ? who 'd been on the bus ? who wanted to get off the bus ? who wants to get off the bus now ? ' he said			0
' so we might have to look at who 's on the bus			0
' @entity0 said he used $ 7 million to $ 8 million of his own money to seed the foundation before he was removed following his doping scandal however he acknowledge it was , at best , a remote possibility			1
' i do n't see that happening anytime soon			2
in fact , i 'm almost certain that 's not going to happen , ' he said			0
he refuses to let that stop him from engaging with people battling cancer			2
' i think it 's convenient for them to put me on the sidelines , ' he said			0
' but i 'm not staying on the sidelines			0

*disgraced* former champion cyclist is ' almost certain ' he wo n't be welcomed back
@entity0 was banned in 2012 following *revelations* the former @entity26 winner doped
