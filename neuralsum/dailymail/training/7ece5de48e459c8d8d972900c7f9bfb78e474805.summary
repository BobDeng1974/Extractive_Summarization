captain @entity2 , 29 , from @entity16 , @entity17 , had a first class degree and was described as an ' exceptional officer ' who was ' unbelievably clever '			1
but an inquest in @entity21 heard that @entity22 was like a ' coiled spring ' who put himself under immense strain			1
he was found dead the day before his 30th birthday and only a week into his deployment at the @entity28 base in the @entity30 district			1
three empty bullet cartridges were found on the floor of the the cubicle next to a pistol			1
colleagues said it was unlikely his death was an accident or that enemy action was involved			2
his room mate , captain @entity41 , said @entity22 got up unusually early and left their tent at around 6.30am on 21 september 2012			0
@entity44 did not hear gunshots but entered the toilet and shower block one minute and 56 seconds later to find blood coming from inside the third cubicle			0
he told the inquest : ' at the time i made the assumption that someone had shot themselves or had suffered a nasty accident			2
' there was blood on the floor which was coming from inside the cubicle			0
i had n’t heard anything to concern me - i definitely had n’t heard gunfire			2
' colleagues used a knife to unlock the door and found @entity22 sitting on the toilet but slumped to the floor with gunshot wounds to the head			1
he was found with a @entity70 9mm pistol - a weapon which soldiers would carry with them at all times			1
up to three empty bullet cases were on the floor of the cubicle and there was a bullet hole in the wall , the inquest heard			1
just three minutes and 18 seconds after @entity2 had entered the block he was on a stretcher , en route to the base ’s medical centre			1

treatment : captain @entity2 was pronounced dead at @entity89			1
doctors tried desperately to save him but he died a short time later however , there was nothing to suggest an underlying issue			0
regiment sergeant major @entity100 of the @entity102 said : “ he came across as quiet and reserved			0
' from what i could see @entity2 put himself under a lot of pressure to do a good job			2
' he was trying to do a good job , and do the job to the best of his ability			0
he was a coiled spring			0
' but i do n’t know much about him and i ’m not sure whether that behaviour was normal			0
' his colleagues told the court it was unlikely his death would have been an accident			2
lieutenant @entity118 said : ' you need a conscious , positive thought to discharge the weapon , it is not something that could be done by accident			0
' i believe it was a self - inflicted gun - shot wound			0
i did not think it was a green on blue threat , which is where rogue members of @entity11 security take out @entity131 troops			2
' ' unbelievably clever ' : the @entity133 graduate , who also worked as a tax associate at @entity135 , had only been at the base for a week captain @entity137 added : ' at the evening briefing @entity2 was asked questions by the commander			1
' he appeared to be hesitant and he was swallowing a lot more than you would usually expect a person to			0
