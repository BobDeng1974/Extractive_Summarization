by @entity0 published : 11:46 est , 7 february 2014 @entity2 : 13:59 est , 7 february 2014 from a young age @entity3 dreamed of becoming a vet			1
and the mother - of - two was so determined that she refused to let a potentially life - threatening allergy to animals get in the way of owning her own veterinary practice			1
the 38 - year - old faces a daily battle against sneezing and spluttering , sticking to a rigorous timetable of medications to help ease her symptoms			1
but carrying out a routine examination on a dog , cat or rabbit can render the vet incapacitated , fighting to breathe and suffering from a painful skin rash			2
@entity25 faces a daily battle against a potentially life - threatening allergy to animals every day is a fight against the allergy , with ms @entity3 keeping a ready supply of antihistamines and inhalers close to hand			1
despite the constant battle , ms @entity3 refuses to let her allergy get in the way of the job she loves			1
she said : ' being a vet is part of who i am - i have never even considered doing anything else			1
' i ’ve known that i ’ve been allergic to cat and dogs from a fairly young age , and the rabbit allergy seemed to develop a few years ago			2
' it can be hard sometimes but as long as i ’m careful and ensure i have good hand hygiene , then i get along fine			2
' i am most allergic to rabbits , so if i feel like my airways are starting to close up i ’ll just step outside and take a few puffs on my inhaler			2
' it would probably be better for me to wear gloves and a mask when i ’m treating an animal , but i do n’t think it ’s fair on them - a mask can look quite scary and you ca n’t examine them properly with gloves on			0
so severe is the 38 - year - old 's allergy , that a routine examination can leave her fighting to breathe and with a painful skin rash the mother - of - two is particularly allergic to rabbits			1
she keeps a ready supply of antihistamines and inhalers close at hand to keep her symptoms at bay ' sometimes i ’m snuffly during a consulation , but i assure the owners i ’m not contagious			1
the animals are never put in in any danger , so i ’ll keep going for as long as i can - i just love my job			0
' ms @entity3 first discovered she was allergic to animals when her family took a dog home from @entity87			1
she said : ' when i was a child i went to @entity89 with my dad and my sister and we came home with a dog			0
' it was common in those days to be allergy tested and shortly after i found out i was allergic to a few animals			2
' i remember playing with my friend ’s kitten , @entity98 , and after she had scratched me a little , as all kittens do , my skin erupted in red wheals			0
' my allergies are constantly changing and evolving - i think i ’ve recently developed an allergy to fleas			1
it starts with an itch in my nose , and i can tell as soon a pet with fleas walks into the room			0
' i ’d say i ’m allergic to pretty much all of the animals that i treat on a regular basis			0
' once i had to treat a giant rabbit and in the car on my way home i really started to struggle to breathe			0
' i stepped out of my car and nearly had to call an ambulance - it was really scary			0
this is when i first realised that i had developed an allergy to rabbits and that i ’d need to control it			2
' rabbits are by far the worst - after i ’ve seen about three or four rabbits in a row i ’ll need to take some time out			0
' but despite her serious allergies , ms @entity3 , who runs the veterinary practice at @entity130 in @entity131 , continues to be dedicated to her profession and refuses to let them get in the way of delivering the best patient care that she can			1
ms @entity3 first discovered she was allergic to animals when , as a child , her family picked up a dog from @entity87 ' i take antihistamines most days , and i have to have my inhalers with me at all times , in case of emergency			1
' most owners would n’t know i have these allergies , as i manage to control them so well			2
' if i know i ’ve got a particularly heavy day - especially with lots of rabbits then i ’ll take extra medication			0
' i also have a fantastic team around me that support me and would know what to do if i had an extreme reaction			0
' but whilst @entity3 battles on through her allergies , she often finds them frustrating			1
she said : ' to be honest i just find them a bit annoying			0
' it just irritates me and i hate getting wheezy because i can barely speak			0
i find it a bit embarrassing but i just try not to think about it most of the time			0
' but despite her allergies , being a vet has always been a dream of @entity3 ’s			1
she added : ' i have never wanted to do anything other than being a vet			2
' as a little girl , when my friends were saying they wanted to be princesses and fairies when they grew up , i always wanted to be a vet			2
' all my soft toys were animals and i absolutely adored our family pets			0
but ms @entity3 refuses to let the allergy get in the way of her dream			1
she said : being a vet , allergies or not , is part of being me , i just love it ' ' i just love animals - the bond that you can have with a pet is just incredible , and i love that i can be there for an animal , and find out what ’s wrong with them when they could never tell you themselves - i give them a voice			1
' i knew that i ’d run into some difficulty being a vet , but i can control my allergies with medications and inhalers , so i ’ll keep going for as long as i can			1
' i have never thought about doing anything else			0
despite the constant challenges , the lack of rest breaks , the long hours , and my allergies , i just love being a vet			2
i would n’t swap it for anything			0
' i spend most of my down time working , either talking to anxious owners or tending to one of the many abandoned pets that come to us			0
' every pet deserves to be loved and cared for , and they are an absolute privilege to own and to work with			0
' being a vet , allergies or not , is part of being me , i just love it			1
