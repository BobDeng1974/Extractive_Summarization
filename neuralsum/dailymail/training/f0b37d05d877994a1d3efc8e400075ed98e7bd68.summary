’ injured : @entity3 hurt his ankle in @entity4 's first leg of their @entity22 play - off against @entity17 tough night for @entity24 @entity24 appeared agitated and confused like a caged beast as he prowled around behind the corporate glass of the @entity29 ’s vip areas before the game , the coach having been banned after his dismissal in the first leg			1
his assistant @entity33 took his place on the touchline but @entity24 was writhing in his seat , chewing his fist			0
caged animal : @entity24 was sitting in the @entity29 stands after he was sent off during the first leg video we pushed @entity4 all the way - @entity40 @entity42 was not happy with some of the physical attention from @entity17 in @entity44 and he was on his feet to complain again in the first half as the @entity48 team started with the same aggressive intent			1
why should opponents make it easy for @entity4 ? although perhaps @entity52 took it a bit far , he was booked for dissent after confronting referee @entity56			0
