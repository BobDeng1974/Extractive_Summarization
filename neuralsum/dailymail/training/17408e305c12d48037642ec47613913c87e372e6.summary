refloated : the calamitous little - known tale of how @entity3 submarine @entity7 sank at its own mooring when blundering crewmen left its hatches open has come to light sinking : @entity7 was about to be refuelled in a wet dock in in @entity9 , @entity10 , in july 1971 when the 280ft vessel began sinking to the horror of her crew rescued from the sinking vessel : hapless submariners had forgotten to shut the torpedo loading bay and the rear escape hatch was also left open so that power cables could be run through to the control room to safety : duty petty officer @entity32 is helped ashore from the sunken @entity7			1
@entity33 had gushed through the torpedo bay at the stern and then the open hatch above it as her fuel tanks were flooded with water in readiness to take on fuel , the vessel sat lower in the water			1
seawater began gushing through the torpedo bay at the stern and then an open hatch above			1
within 15 minutes the 1,300 - ton submarine , which had served the @entity3 for 25 years , had sunk to the bottom of the dock			1
three crew members trapped inside , although they escaped 12 hours later			1
however , the submarine was irreparably damaged			0
many of her senior officers , including her commander , were not aboard at the time - and @entity7 was under the control of her third hand			2
following the calamity , a damning report was compiled laying blame firmly on the crew for negligence			0
saved : acting @entity63 was one of three men trapped inside the forward torpedo room of @entity7 when she sank in @entity9 in july 1971 getting out : @entity63 was the second man to escape from the sunken @entity7			1
a frogman is pictured ( right ) diving in to pull him to safety out of the water : a frogman with @entity63 , one of the three escaped trapped sailors at the scene in 1971 aid : leading marine engineering mechanic @entity75 is helped to an ambulance after escaping the embarrassing story has come to light after a former crewman took an engine telegraph he salvaged from the wreck along to the @entity85 programme @entity83			1
@entity7 was an a-class submarine , built by @entity87 of @entity88 on the @entity89			2
it was launched just after the end of the @entity92 in august 1946 , before taking part in the @entity94 seven years later for @entity96 's coronation			0
she weighed 1,360 tons and was 280ft long , with a beam of 22ft and a depth of 16ft			0
it had a diving depth limit of 350ft , a surface speed of 18.5 knots and a crew of 61			0
@entity7 sank in july 1971 while while moored at the @entity105 shore - establishment at a wet dock @entity9 , @entity10 , during refuelling			1
she had been there for maintenance , but water began to come in through the open hatchways when she was ballasted down , and she sank			2
the submarine was raised five days after sinking before being decommissioned , and sold to be broken up for scrap that december			0
a report called ' @entity7 - the lessons learnt ' was produced following the incident - and it is still said to be essential reading for submarine commanders even today			2
over its 22 pages , there are 65 errors of judgement			0
@entity124 , an engine room stoker who was 22 at the time , bought the device upon seeing the wrecked sub about to be dismantled at a scrap yard in @entity131 in 1993			0
the machine , used to send messages from the bridge to the engine room , still has watermarks on it from where it was flooded			0
mr @entity124 , 65 , from @entity131 , said : ‘ @entity7 had just undergone its last ever refit at the dry dock in @entity9 , which i had worked on			1
‘ following the refit i took leave to my home in @entity146 and was in the pub when the landlord ’s son came over and said my submarine had just sunk			2
‘ he had just seen it on tv so i got straight onto my motorbike and rode home to see the news			0
‘ as the sub ’s fuel tanks were being flooded with sea water , which is done on subs for ballast purposes , water started coming in through the torpedo bay which had been left open			1
‘ as the torpedo bay filled up the stern of the sub sank down until water started coming in through the rear escape hatch , which had power cables running through it into the control room			1
‘ the hatch could n’t be shut because of the cables and within 15 minutes the whole thing was at the bottom of the harbour			1
basically the crew on the submarine that day were not doing their jobs properly			0
‘ the whole affair was a pr disaster for the @entity3 , especially because it happened at the @entity183 headquarters , and not something they like talking about even to this day			0
programmer : the story has come to light after former crewman @entity124 took an engine telegraph he salvaged from the wreck along to @entity85 's @entity83			1
he is seen ( left ) with expert @entity191 ( right ) discussion : another view of mr @entity124 ( left ) , 65 , from @entity131 , talking to expert @entity191 ( right ) engine telegraph : mr @entity124 , an engine room stoker who was 22 at the time , bought the device upon seeing the wrecked sub about to be dismantled at a scrap yard in @entity131 in 1993 photograph : an image from the sinking in july 1971 is shown to the expert on the @entity83 ‘ it was an embarrassment that should never have happened			1
in 1993 i noticed @entity7 was being cut up and so i went along to see if there was anything left that i could have as a souvenir			0
‘ the only thing left was the port engine telegraph which i bought for £ 30			2
’ ' the whole affair was a pr disaster for the @entity3 , especially because it happened at the @entity183 headquarters , and not something they like talking about even to this day ' @entity124 , former engine room stoker the engineering officer , the third hand and the chief stoker were all found at a court martial to have been guilty of making mistakes that caused the submarine to sink			0
@entity225 , historian at the @entity226 in @entity9 , said : ‘ the sinking of @entity7 was not the @entity183 ’s finest hour - it was all very embarrassing			1
‘ it was a watershed moment for the service and had far reaching consequences which are still being felt today			0
‘ the @entity3 ’s first nuclear submarines had been introduced to some controversy not long before , and here was a group of seamen who could n’t keep their submarine afloat when docked at the service ’s hq			0
submarine : it was built by @entity87 of @entity88 on the @entity89 at night : the recovery scene when @entity7 sank at the @entity105 shore establishment in @entity9 man with the engine telegraph : former crew member @entity124 ( first left ) at a ceremonial visit in 1969 looking back : the @entity248 's front page on july 2 , 1971 - the day after @entity7 sank in @entity9 seen today : a more recent panoramic view of the @entity105 shore establishment at @entity9 in @entity10 ‘ it did not look good at all			1
following the sinking the @entity3 came down hard and a document was produced warning of the danger of complacency			0
' it was a watershed moment for the service and had far reaching consequences which are still being felt today ' @entity225 , historian ' it is still used today , and thankfully the incident has never been repeated			0
’ @entity191 , the @entity83 specialist , tells mr @entity124 on the show : ‘ i think it ’s a great story because it ’s the sort of story that never gets told because it ’s about bungled - you know it ’s not the great heroics that we ’d all expect			2
but you ’ve got this great treasure and it is a very important piece			0
’ mr @entity124 ’s telegraph machine from @entity7 will feature on the @entity83 on sunday .			2

@entity7 was about to be refuelled at @entity9 wet dock in july 1971
but hapless submariners had forgotten to shut the torpedo loading bay
rear escape hatch was also open so power cables could be run through
seawater began gushing through torpedo bay and open hatch above it
fifteen minutes later the 1,300 - ton submarine had sunk to bottom of dock
three crew members were trapped inside but all escaped 12 hours later
story comes to light thanks to engine telegraph on @entity83
