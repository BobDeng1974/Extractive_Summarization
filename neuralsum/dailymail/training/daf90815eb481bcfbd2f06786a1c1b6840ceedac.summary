an angry businessman has threatened to raise a weather balloon above his land every day to stop a ‘ gang of @entity9 ’ from prince @entity5 ’s @entity4 base thundering overhead in their planes			1
@entity10 , 62 , said the aircraft roar over his estate up to 75 times a day , as low as 200ft and at speeds of around 400mph , instead of flying over empty fields			1
he was so annoyed by the @entity17 jets that he threatened to raise a balloon into their flight path every day from his property in @entity21 , @entity22 , to deter the pilots			1
frustration : @entity10 has planes from @entity25 in @entity21 regularly flying over his property runway : aircraft at @entity4 valley , which fly excessively over @entity30 according to mr @entity10 the chartered surveyor said the planes from nearby @entity25 , where the @entity32 works as a rescue pilot , were scaring children attending a nursery on his land at @entity37 , where he rents out property to businesses			1
long running dispute : mr @entity10 says he has corresponded with successive station commanders requesting they adjust their course he repeatedly wrote to the base , asking in one letter : ‘ are our children being subjected , as some say in the village , to punishment by a gang of @entity9 for daring to ask if they will fly over open fields instead of a children ’s nursery ? ’ in another letter , he warned : ‘ since you have refused to send independent observers to @entity37 i will be arranging for a weather balloon to be raised daily at the corner of our property			1
it will be taken down each evening at midnight			0
’ within 48 hours of the base receiving the balloon threat , police were dispatched to talk to him and said the @entity4 had become concerned for their safety and that of the public			2
mr @entity10 said he felt the response was ‘ ridiculous ’			2
‘ i told the policeman i was proposing to put one up because the planes were scaring the children , ’ he said			0
‘ the safety aspect of this was my main concern and i was worried			0
‘ these planes are coming in at a speed of around 400mph and as they get to the edge of the property they open the throttle and give it a hell of a blast			0
‘ i had noticed that the jets were starting to fly much lower and far more regularly			0
‘ they were flying straight over us despite having the rest of the fields surrounding us , which are either empty or have cattle in			0
’ the problems are being caused by fighter - jet pilots from prince @entity5 's airbase a spokesman for @entity25 said : ‘ we take our broader community responsibilities very seriously and we always strive to be a good neighbour , so we regret that mr @entity10 has had cause to complain			1
' [ pilots ] are instructed to try to avoid direct over-flight of the @entity98 children ’s nursery whenever possible			0
’ speaking of the response to the balloon threat , a police spokesman said : ‘ @entity103 classified the event as “ precautionary ” and deployed an officer to speak with the resident and clarify his intentions and advise of the possible dangers to air traffic and the local community			2
‘ an amicable conversation ensued during which time our concerns for safety to local residents and air traffic were expressed			0
’ ' good neighbours ' : an @entity4 spokesman said they take their community responsibilities very seriously and regretted mr @entity10 's cause for complaint defence : mr @entity10 threatened to raise a weather balloon like this one 499 feet above his property			1
