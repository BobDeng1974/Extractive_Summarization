he is particularly venomous about @entity125 's extensive legal claims on his royalties claiming he ' grabs all he can ' , taking ' Â£ 3 million - or thereabouts ' of @entity1 's royalties under a later @entity153 deal with @entity154 , which the singer called ' a farce of unimaginable proportions '			1
