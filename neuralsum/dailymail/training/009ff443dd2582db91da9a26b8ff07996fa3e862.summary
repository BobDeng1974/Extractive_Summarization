education secretary @entity0 has been accused of ' sitting on ' warnings of a ' @entity3 ' plots since 2010 education secretary @entity0 was accused yesterday of ‘ sitting on ’ four - year - old warnings that @entity6 hardliners were attempting to take over @entity8 schools			1
headteacher @entity9 said he cautioned the @entity10 ( @entity10 ) in 2010 about governors with a ‘ disproportionate impact ’ wanting to replace one sitting city head with a @entity6			1
he had described a ‘ bloodless coup ’ at one @entity8 school and ‘ an alliance to destabilise the head ’ at another – three years before a letter alleging a ‘ @entity3 ’ plot was sent to the council			1
mr @entity9 also highlighted ‘ aggressive ’ , ‘ intimidating ’ and ‘ highly organised ’ governors that a primary headteacher believed were from a ‘ co-ordinated group ’ trying to exercise control over a school ’s collective worship policy and other issues			1
the @entity10 has insisted that its meeting with mr @entity9 – head of @entity30 , @entity8 , was a ‘ general policy discussion ’			1
but @entity33 ’s @entity32 , @entity34 , said mr @entity0 was complacent and had failed to listen to warnings			2
allegations emerged in early march about a so - called ‘ @entity41 ’ plot by hardline @entity38 to seize control of @entity8 schools			1
@entity42 has since launched inspections of 21 schools while @entity45 and the government are also carrying out their own separate investigations			0
the @entity10 has appointed @entity48 , the former national head of counter-terrorism , to probe the alleged ‘ @entity3 ’ plot			1
mr @entity9 , whose school is not being inspected by @entity42 , told @entity52 he gave the department a presentation about the threat in 2010			1
he said : ‘ back in 2010 , i had a whole series of colleagues , other headteachers , who were reporting concerns about governance and things that were n’t going well in their schools			1
‘ over 20 years … tensions and politics have exploded and as a result headteachers have had nervous breakdowns , they ’ve lost their jobs , schools have been really torn apart			1
’ slides from the presentation describe ‘ staff and governors in an alliance to destabilise the head ’ at one secondary school			1
the @entity77 in @entity8 - which , according to whistleblowers , has been infiltrated by @entity38 extremists who are attempting to change the school and target young people ‘ ( a ) member of staff ( was ) suspended , having tried to prove the head to be fraudulent			1
’ at another school it was claimed there was a plot to remove the head teacher , mr @entity9 said			1
the slide said : ‘ two governors with disproportionate impact ... want to remove the head to have a @entity6 head ... ( they are ) working to undermine him			2
a known explicit intention the head lives with			2
’ at a primary school , a dramatic increase in interest in joining the governing body was described			0
previously , it had been ‘ hard to recruit a single parent ’			0
‘ at the start of a new year four vacancies generate 13 nominations , ’ mr @entity9 said			0
‘ the @entity105 [ headteacher ] believed four to be from a specific co-ordinated group			0
three were elected and the fourth came on as an @entity111 ( local authority ) governor			0
this group were highly organised / nationally networked			0
' @entity0 refused to listen to the warnings about radical hardliners ' ‘ the focal point was collective worship and a parent / public meeting was called			2
this was aggressive , intimidating ... issues spread to swimming , other curriculum areas , meals , uniform			0
’ mr @entity9 , one of about 800 national leaders of education , told @entity52 he was not surprised the @entity10 did not act on his concerns			0
‘ what i think the solutions might be are in the absolute opposite direction to government policy , ’ he said			2
‘ because of the academy programme encouraging schools to opt out of local authority control , you ’ve got increasing numbers of schools acting individually , on their own			0
‘ we have schools that have now become increasingly isolated and segregated			0
’ a @entity10 spokesman said : ‘ our records show this was a general policy discussion			1
there is absolutely no place for extremism in schools and this government has taken a number of significant steps to combat it			0
‘ this meeting took place at the same time as the @entity10 was enhancing our due diligence and counter-extremism capability to make schools more aware of risks and to protect children			2
’ but @entity34 insisted the government should have acted on the allegations			0
he said : ‘ @entity0 refused to listen to the warnings about radical hardliners taking control of schools			0
his department has sat on these warnings for four years ‘ this is gross negligence on the part of ministers			2
@entity0 ’s complacency has given rise to a constant stream of failings in our school system			0

@entity175 ' sent letter to the council warning of bloodless coup ' in 2010
caution came three years before council learned of ' @entity3 plot '
council insists meeting with head in 2010 was a ' general policy discussion '
