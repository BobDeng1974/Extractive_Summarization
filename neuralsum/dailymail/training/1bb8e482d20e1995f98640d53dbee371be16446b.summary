a group of mothers are campaigning to remove an inappropriate range of @entity4 clothing from the shelves of all @entity7 ' us stores			1
@entity9 - based mother @entity8 started an online petition asking the retailer to remove the ' damaging ' garments after seeing the new collection , which is designed for baby girls aged zero to 24 months , on shelves and online			1
the campaign comes just one week after @entity19 ' sister store @entity18 agreed to stop selling a line of breaking bad action figures , after parents accused the retailer of promoting drug use through the sale of the toys			1
' you pulled the @entity47 toys because they promoted drug use			2
you should pull this clothing line because it promotes bad behavior as well			2
' the madness has to stop			2
if the toys are damaging so is the clothing			0
' the collection , which is an extension of @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity58 's globally - successful @entity57 for adults , includes a $ 25 leatherette mini skirt - with ' attached diaper cover ' - a $ 33 fur faux animal print vest and a $ 23 leatherette skirt			1
each of the designs , while not necessarily the personal handiwork of @entity55 , 34 , @entity56 , 30 and @entity58 , 35 , have all been given the seal of approval by the sisters which is perhaps all the more disturbing given that @entity55 and @entity58 both have young daughters of their own			0
@entity58 welcomed her daughter @entity73 , her second child with long - term partner @entity74 , in july 2012 , while @entity55 and @entity76 's daughter @entity77 was born on june 15 last year			0
at the time of writing , the petition , which is just a few days old , has already been signed more than 2,000 times by eager supporters , many of whom wholeheartedly agree with @entity8 's thoughts about the offending clothing designs			1
motherly instincts : both @entity55 , 34 , and @entity58 , 35 , have young daughters of their own ' damaging ' : the designs , such as this pair of gold lurex pants , have been deemed completely inappropriate for young children ' disgusting ' : the collection includes a number of short skirts and tight - fitting lurex trousers @entity97 from @entity98 , @entity99 , wrote : ' babies do n't need to look like porn stars ' while @entity103 from @entity104 , @entity102 added : ' @entity47 toys are nowhere near as damaging to a young psyche as sexualization at such a young age			1
' these people should be ashamed			0
' the campaign has also convinced some people to boycott the store entirely , with one mother commenting on the petition : ' disgusting			0
i was just looking at starting my baby registry at @entity18 last night			1
i am so glad i saw this first			0
@entity4 controversy : while @entity56 , @entity55 and @entity58 did not design each of the garments themselves , each item of clothing has been given their seal of approval car crash clothing : while the @entity129 ' clothing collections have proved incredibly popular with adults , they seem to have missed the mark with their unsuitable childrenswear designs ' i would never spend my money on it ' : the petition has now been signed by more than 2,000 people , many of whom have children and grandchildren of their own 's * * * * s and babies just do not go together			2
babies are innocent , @entity55 is a s * * * k , any questions ? ' and it 's not just parents who have taken offence at the inappropriate clothing collection			2
@entity150 , a grandmother from @entity151 , @entity152 , said of the designs : ' i am a grandmother and shop at @entity18			0
' i find the @entity155 completely inappropriate and would never spend my money on any @entity4 merchandise that promotes their stardom from a sex tape			0
' @entity160 has contacted @entity19 for a comment			0
' babies are innocent ' : one mother claimed that she will not shop at @entity18 until the offending garments are removed @entity166 garments : these gold lurex trousers retail for $ 33 stop the madness : @entity9 - based mother @entity8 is demanding that the @entity170 's ' damaging ' baby clothes be removed from all @entity19 stores			1

@entity9 mom @entity8 is *calling* for the retailer to remove the offending garments which are designed for baby girls aged 0 to 24 months
the collection includes a $ 25 leatherette mini skirt and $ 33 gold lurex pants
