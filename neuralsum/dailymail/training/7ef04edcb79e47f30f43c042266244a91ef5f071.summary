the family of a 35 - year - old mother who died under @entity3 respite care have accused doctors of making no attempt to save her life because they assumed she was dying anyway			1
@entity7 was suffering from cancer but had been told she could live for a further two years			1
but the mother of six died within days of being admitted to a palliative care centre last month with what her family thought was a routine infection			1
tragic : @entity7 who passed away at @entity15 in @entity16 , @entity17 , with son @entity18 the day before her death last month , she had been looking forward to going home , chatting with her children , eating crackers and drinking cola , her family claim			1
but when her husband @entity26 visited her the following day he found her heavily sedated			1
when he urged unit staff to send her to hospital for treatment , they refused – saying she would only die in the ambulance			2
mr @entity32 had already become concerned about his wife ’s treatment after finding she had been labelled with a ‘ do not resuscitate ’ notice			1
the notice , which meant she would not be revived if she suffered a medical crisis , went against the wishes of @entity32 and her family , who were desperate to prolong her life so she could spend precious months with her children , aged between one and 17			1
yet mr @entity32 said he and his wife had to ask five times to have the notice removed			1
after her death , mr @entity32 claims he was told by a nurse and his gp that despite being expected to live for at least 18 months , his wife had been put on the @entity50 , the controversial system designed to ease the suffering of the dying in their final hours			2
last night the clinic denied that mrs @entity7 had been placed on the @entity50			1
marriage : @entity7 , pictured on her wedding day in august 2006 with her husband @entity26 but the case will reignite debate over the treatment of those who are believed to be dying			1
thousands of patients are placed on the @entity50 every year , which some medics say leads to the premature deaths of more than 100,000			2
mr @entity32 said : ‘ @entity7 had a lot of things she wanted to do for the children			1
she did n’t get a chance to say goodbye to them			2
’ ' @entity7 had a lot of things she wanted to do for the children			1
she did n’t get a chance to say goodbye to them ' @entity75 the @entity76 and @entity77 , which runs the unit where mrs @entity7 died , declined to give further information on the case before mrs @entity7 ’s inquest			1
the @entity50 was devised in the 1990s and involves the heavy sedation of a patient and the removal of tubes providing food and fluid			2
however its use was criticised in the summer by a senior consultant , professor @entity89 , who told a medical conference that nearly a third of @entity3 deaths now involve patients on the pathway			2
he said a decision to put a patient on the @entity50 has become ‘ a self - fulfilling prophecy ’ , adding that ‘ factors like pressure on beds and difficulty with nursing confused or difficult - to - manage elderly patients can not be excluded ’			1
mrs @entity7 , who had two children from a previous marriage and four – aged seven , four , three and one – with her husband , was diagnosed with cervical cancer in january last year which later spread to her lymph nodes			1
mother - of - six : mrs @entity7 ( pictured left , and right with other people at her wedding ) , had two children from a previous marriage and four - aged seven , four , three and one - with her husband her husband said she had been given between 18 months and two years to live			1
mr @entity32 , a former care worker who now looks after his children full - time , said a nurse had advised him last month that his wife should be admitted to @entity15 in @entity16 for palliative care			1
the @entity50 was devised in the city in the 1990s to make the dying as comfortable and free of pain as possible			2
it was recommended to hospitals across the @entity123 by the @entity124 in 2004			2
the pathway is designed to come into operation when doctors believe it is impossible for a patient to recover and death is imminent			2
patients on the pathway are sedated with drugs and deprived of nutrition and hydration by tube			2
on average a patient will die 33 hours after entering the pathway			2
critics of the system claim it is increasingly being applied to patients without their families ’ knowledge			0
‘ i believed she had an infection , ’ he said			1
‘ she had had the same symptoms in the past with infections			0
i did n’t think it was serious at all			0
’ mr @entity32 and the children visited mrs @entity7 on september 19			1
‘ she was active , cheerful and looking forward to going home , ’ mr @entity32 said			0
‘ she spoke to her children , she was eating cheese and crackers , and she was drinking @entity159 with lemon			0
’ however , he said , his wife was concerned because she had been told doctors had placed a ‘ do not resuscitate ’ notice in her notes			1
mr @entity32 said his wife told him : ‘ i have fought this far			0
why would i want to die now ? ’ however , he said , it took five requests from himself and his wife before medics removed the @entity169 notice			1
the following day , at 6.30am , mr @entity32 was phoned by nurses to be told his wife had been bleeding and vomiting			0
he was , he said , told she was likely to die that day			0
‘ i could n’t understand it at all , ’ he said			0
‘ i could n’t understand why they assumed she was going to die so quickly			0
’ on arriving at the unit he said he found that his wife had been heavily sedated and no tubes for artificial hydration or nutrition had been connected			1
sad case : her husband said she had been given between 18 months and two years to live he said he was later told she had been placed on the @entity50			1
‘ i asked a nurse and she said , “ we are treating her on the @entity50			0
the papers have been prepared by the doctor and she is being treated as a dying lady on the @entity50 ”			0
’ he said he ‘ argued with ’ doctors to provide his wife with intravenous fluid and this was done			0
as her condition worsened he threatened to call an ambulance to take her to hospital			0
' i could n’t understand it at all			0
i could n’t understand why they assumed she was going to die so quickly ' mr @entity32 ‘ they said i should n’t do that , ’ he said			0
‘ they said it would disturb her dignity and she would die in the ambulance			0
’ his wife died at 8.30pm that evening			1
‘ her death was sudden and very unexpected , ’ he said			0
‘ she would have been shocked at the idea that she was dying			0
we all thought she had a year , probably a year and a half			0
she wanted to make boxes for the children , with pictures and other things to remember her by			2
’ he added : ‘ one day she was eating and drinking			0
the next she was dead			0
it makes no sense to me			0
’ a spokesman for the @entity76 and @entity77 said : ‘ we can confirm this patient was not on the @entity50			0
however , we have been advised by the coroner that it would be inappropriate to comment further at this time as it may be subject to a coroner ’s inquest			0
