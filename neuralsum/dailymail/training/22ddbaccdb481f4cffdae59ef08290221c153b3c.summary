fearless @entity0 says @entity2 do not fear @entity3 and @entity4 because they have a generation of players who can make @entity10 history and stay on top of the world game for years to come			1
low , who leads @entity2 into their first @entity10 final since 2002 , where they can become the first @entity17 side ever to lift the trophy in @entity19 , is confident the restructuring of @entity22 football over the past ten years will build to a victorious climax at the @entity24			1
‘ we do n’t have any fear whatsoever , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ we have the necessary level of self - confidence and the respect for our opponents ’ strength , but we are convinced if we impose our game , we will win			2
in the past , @entity51 have dominated in @entity19 all the time			2
this would be considered an additional joy for us if we were to win as @entity17 on @entity55 soil			2
’ the @entity22 @entity56 restructured its administration and coaching after failures at @entity60 and 2004 , with @entity0 joining the coaching staff ten years ago			0
he suffered @entity10 semi-final defeat in 2006 , as assistant , and in 2010			0
but the ruthless way in which @entity2 ripped @entity65 apart in the semi-finals sent shockwaves through world football			2
@entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity72 were all outstanding - as was 23 - year - old @entity73 , who came off the bench to score a fine brace			0
if the @entity22 win again to lift the @entity10 on sunday , @entity0 is convinced it will not be the last time his players do so			2
running riot : @entity2 scored four goals in six first - half minutes during tuesday 's semi-final against @entity65 midfield battle : @entity2 's @entity72 was brilliant against @entity82 in the centre of the pitch with an average age of 26 , this @entity2 squad is the sixth youngest in @entity65			1
and two of their rising stars - @entity90 and @entity91 - are both missing through injury			0
low thinks the potential is there for @entity2 to dominate world football - just as @entity98 did when they won three successive major trophies , starting with @entity100			2
‘ we have players at their peak , but we also have young players in the squad and others who are n’t even here , players with a fantastic future , ’ said @entity0			0
‘ @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity110 , @entity73 , @entity70 can go on to play on top of the world for a good few years yet , with young players coming in to reinforce the team			0
’ planning : low and @entity71 talk in training ahead of @entity2 's @entity10 final against @entity4 skills school : low controls a ball with his hamstring as he joins in during @entity2 's training session multi-tasking : @entity71 prepares for the final at @entity2 's training base in @entity49 @entity0 has warned his team not to obsess about the threat of @entity3 , though many observers see the game as a chance to elevate the @entity131 superstar to the level of the legendary @entity133 and @entity134 if he wins the @entity10			1
low , whose side beat @entity4 4 - 0 in the quarter - final four years ago , said : ‘ this team is not only about @entity3			1
' if you believed it was , you ’d be making a mistake			0
they have @entity143 , @entity144 , @entity145			0
their team is better organised than in 2010 as they ’ve shown over the tournament			0
after their 7 - 1 demolition of @entity65 in the semi-final , @entity2 are big favourites to beat @entity4 and win the @entity10 in @entity49			1
if they are successful , it will be fourth time they have won the famous trophy - but it will be the only occasion they have triumphed on @entity19 soil			2
indeed , no @entity17 nation has won the tournament on this continent in four attempts			0
@entity164 and @entity165 reached the final in 1962 and 1978 respectively , but @entity0 hopes his team can go one better in @entity65 this weekend			1
sweet sixteen : @entity169 became the @entity10 's all - time top goalscorer with his strike against @entity65 focus : low stands in the middle of the group and gives instructions to his squad on the eve of the final ever since @entity2 hammered @entity181 4 - 0 in the group stages , they seemed destined to make sunday 's final			1
their only scare came in the second round when they needed extra-time to beat @entity189 , one of the surprise packages of the tournament			0
@entity0 's optimism is also born out of the fact that he has done everything possible to get his team ready for sunday 's game - both physically and mentally			1
the @entity2 coach and his backroom staff scoured the planet on scouting missions well before the tournament began and they have been working on a plan to defeat the @entity204 ever since they swept @entity65 aside in @entity205			1
' over the last few years we 've travelled and watched international football , in @entity17 and @entity19 , and we 've tried to learn little things that can influence matches , ' @entity0 said			1
disciplined : @entity2 were ruthless against @entity65 in their semi-final , scoring five in the first half pre-match press conference : @entity2 coach @entity0 is positive of his side 's chances in the final ' we 've taken on the new - fangled things that are being done			1
we have looked at @entity98 and we 've looked across the border at what the @entity220 are doing - how they train individual players			0
' that planning extends to penalty preparation too			0
@entity226 has been tirelessly studying @entity4 's penalty takers so he is primed and ready should they match go beyond extra-time			1
@entity2 have one of the best penalty records in history , but @entity0 hopes his team win in normal time			1
' we hope and expect to decide the match before , ' he said			0
' penalty shoot - outs depend on so many things			0
' they 're an additional pressure			0
but all the goalkeepers are ready for that potential			0
we have tried to analyse the situation			0
' calm : @entity2 's first - choice goalkeeper @entity226 is confident if the final goes to penalties on sunday @entity2 and @entity4 share a rich history when it comes to @entity248			1
@entity2 defeated the @entity19 nation to win @entity250 and four years earlier @entity134 captained the @entity204 to @entity10 glory after a 3 - 2 final win over @entity2			1
' it will be a gripping final between two teams who have had fascinating duels in the past , ' said @entity0			2
leader : @entity3 has dragged @entity4 to the @entity10 final with a string of fine displays			1

@entity2 are attempting to become the first @entity17 side to win the @entity10 in @entity19
@entity0 's side demolished @entity65 7 - 1 in the semi-finals to reach the final
@entity2 coach says his team do not fear @entity204 star @entity3
he is confident the *current* crop can make history by winning against @entity4 and then go on to win the trophy again in 2018
@entity226 says he is ready if the final has to be decided by penalties
