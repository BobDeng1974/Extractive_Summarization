mrs @entity3 , a 69 - year - old choir singer , had spent four months waiting for the case to come to trial , but was finally vindicated when prosecutors offered no evidence at the hearing			1
accused of harassment : for four years , @entity3 had tried to get in touch with her son 's young twins , whom she had n't seen since he died in 2009 as magistrates acquitted mrs @entity3 , who was spared the indignity of standing in the dock , applause broke out in the public gallery from the dozen friends and relatives who had supported her			1

mrs @entity3 has not seen her twin grandchildren since a few months before their father , @entity34 , a project manager , died of bowel cancer in may 2009 , at the age of 41			1
they are now just a few months off their tenth birthdays			0
after her acquittal , mrs @entity3 said the fight to maintain contact with the children had devastated the health of her 74 - year - old husband @entity44 , an ex-farming union secretary			1
she blamed the stress of their long fight – which included three run - ins with police – for a string of mini-strokes suffered by mr @entity52			2
fight : mrs @entity3 has not seen her twin grandchildren , pictured with parents @entity34 and @entity54 , since a few months before her son died of bowel cancer in may 2009 , at the age of 41 mrs @entity3 said : ‘ i am a loving grandmother who has never been near a police station , let alone a court before			1
‘ how can i be taken to court simply for trying to stay in touch with my only grandchildren ? ‘ it is n’t right			2
@entity44 and i have suffered a double loss			0
not only have we had to bury our only son , but we have lost contact with our only grandchildren			1
‘ we do n’t even know if the children realise we are still alive			0
’ she said the case highlighted how it was not only the parents of separated couples who could lose contact with their grandchildren			1
she added that she had been determined to ‘ have my day in court ’ on behalf of other grandparents in a similar position			0
mrs @entity3 added : ‘ @entity34 assured us before he died that we would n’t lose contact with our grandchildren			1
@entity81 appearance : @entity82 arrives at @entity81 after accusing her mother - in - law of harassment ‘ i will keep fighting for him as much as myself			1
grandparents have so much to offer their grandchildren			0
‘ we used to pick the children up from school			0
we would ice cakes together and i would always make them an @entity91 bonnet			0
’ the government has promised to address the issue , but grandparents still have no legal right to access to their grandchildren – although they do have the right to apply to the family court for leave of access			0
mrs @entity3 said family lawyers had warned her such action could cost thousands of pounds – money she does not have			1
her defence costs in the criminal case this week were covered by legal aid			0
the pensioner , from @entity107 , @entity108 , said she had no idea why her daughter - in - law , a part - time veterinary nurse , halted access to the children following @entity34 ’s death			0
the couple had met at school when @entity34 was 17 and @entity54 a year younger			0
mrs @entity3 claimed that after @entity34 died , @entity54 let out their home and moved away with the children			1
the @entity119 hired a private detective , and that december he tracked @entity54 down to a village near @entity122 , where she was living with a new partner and the children			0
@entity54 , 44 , told police her mother - in - law was harassing her , and mrs @entity3 was interviewed , but said the @entity126 decided against any charges			1
the @entity119 began sending their grandchildren cheques in birthday and @entity132 cards , first to their home and later to their school , without acknowledgement			0
by june last year they were so desperate to see the children they drove to their village home			0
@entity54 ’s partner called police and the @entity141 left after speaking to officers			0
@entity143 later wrote to @entity52 to advise that no further action would be taken , but warned that any future contact could ‘ constitute harassment ’			1
this june mrs @entity3 was issued a summons to court			2
the indictment accused her of harassing @entity54 through the sending of four cards or letters between december last year and march 2013			2
they consisted of a letter to @entity54 , a letter to her partner ’s mother , pleading for her help to resolve the situation , and a letter to @entity54 from mrs @entity3 ’s lawyer			2
the fourth and final communication consisted of some @entity91 cards which mrs @entity3 sent to the children ’s head teacher in the hope they would be passed on			2
her solicitor , @entity167 , said : ‘ the sorry fact is a decent , law - abiding mother and grandmother was placed at risk of a criminal conviction because of one question which has still not been answered : “ why ca n’t she see her grandchildren ? ” ’ she warned that @entity52 and her husband will need to find a ‘ fighting fund ’ to take their case to the family court			2
