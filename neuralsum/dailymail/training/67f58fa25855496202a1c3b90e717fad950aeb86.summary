and he criticised @entity15 's supporters of organising mass rallies and ' street mobs ' to intimidate no campaigners			1
@entity33 author @entity3 was subjected to obscene online abuse from so - called ' cybernats ' earlier this year after donating £ 1million to the no campaign			1

businesswoman @entity24 has also been attacked for warning of the dangers of @entity31 independence			1
lord @entity6 also criticised @entity0 for their rallies accusing the @entity45 of bias after its political editor @entity47 posed tough questions to mr @entity15			2
the former labour cabinet minister said : ' the language that i worry about is the language of abuse towards not only men , but women in particular - @entity3 , @entity24 , the opponents of separatism			1
' the online abuse , the fact they are now demanding that reporters doing their jobs are sacked , the mass rallies , the street mobs - that 's what worries me			1
' thankfully i do n't think that is anything that is anywhere near the heart of the vast majority of @entity31 people			0
' i think we should conduct our arguments in a robust fashion but be careful in the language we use			0
' lord @entity6 was speaking at a rally in @entity75 to highlight how independence would put thousands of shipbuilding jobs on the @entity78 at risk			2

' he will not come and look the workers in the eye despite repeated requests			0
' i 've got a simple message			0
what would you say to a used car salesman who would not look you in the eye when selling you a car ? you would no thanks - thanks , but no thanks			0
' and that 's the simple message to people in @entity31 over the next few days			0
a no vote is one to protect jobs , to create more jobs in the future , for our children and our grandchildren			0
' lord @entity6 said jobs would be under threat because the @entity119 would no longer commission warships from a foreign country - and because an independent @entity31 would not need them			2
' the amount of money that @entity15 is going to spend on defence is going to come nowhere near what the @entity119 puts in , ' he said			0
