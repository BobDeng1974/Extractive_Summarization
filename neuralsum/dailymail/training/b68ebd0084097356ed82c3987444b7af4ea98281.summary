by @entity0 published : 17:35 est , 5 august 2013 updated : 17:35 est , 5 august 2013 the quintessentially @entity2 pastime of selling homemade jams and cakes at the village fete to raise money for a good cause is as old as the hills			0
but when @entity11 guidelines on food hygiene were introduced it sparked panic among the self - appointed health and safety police			1
they issued strict new guidance which saw the pots of homemade gooseberry jam and chocolate cakes disappearing from community fundraisers			2
victory for common sense : the ruling comes days after @entity26 , 12 , was told she could n't sell homemade cupcakes to her schoolmates because her mother , @entity29 , did not have a food hygiene certificate but now the food watchdog in the @entity2 has handed every keen cake baker and jam maker a reprieve which should see village fêtes offering home produce once again			2
the @entity37 ( @entity37 ) has ruled that volunteer cooks and charity groups who occasionally prepare food for community events are not covered by @entity43 laws			1
so that means they no longer need to possess a food hygiene certificate before they are allowed to offer their wares for sale			2
in black and white , the ruling states : ‘ there is no rule banning the sale of homemade cakes at school fêtes or other community events			1
’ the new @entity37 guidance comes just days after schoolgirl @entity26 , 12 , was banned from selling homemade cupcakes to her schoolmates at an end - of - term charity event			1
pleased : @entity61 , restaurateur and judge on @entity64 s @entity63 , called it ' the best news that has come out of the @entity37 for years ' she was told he could not offer from for sale because the baker - her mother , @entity69 , 39 - did not have a food hygiene certificate			1
@entity72 , headteacher at her school , the @entity71 , said a health and safety adviser had told them not to accept home produce as they could be liable if someone fell ill. but the food watchdog now says that most charity and community organisation provide food less than once a month and do not need to register their activities			1
only groups that serve hot food regularly , deal with the under - fives or the elderly or are involved in large scale events need to be registered			1
@entity88 and guide groups as well as bring - and - buy sales , @entity91 events and village fêtes are also cleared to sell their produce without registering			0
the move has been welcomed by professional chefs and amateur cooks alike who have called it a ‘ a refreshing injection of common sense			1
’ mrs @entity26 , a mother - of - five from @entity101 on the @entity102 , said : ‘ @entity103			0
i am very pleased about that			0
’ ‘ selling homemade cakes and jams to raise money for good causes is a traditional @entity2 pursuit and something that should be applauded to banned			0
‘ i was stunned when my daughter , @entity113 , was told she could not sell the cupcakes i had baked			0
it was a @entity116 recipe - for goodness sake ! ’ she said : ‘ it is a refreshing injection of common sense and i welcome it wholeheartedly			0
it make children self - sufficient to bake and also instils a sense of social responsibility of they are baking for charity			0
’ @entity61 , restaurateur and judge on @entity64 ’s @entity63 , said : ‘ it ’s the best news that has come out of the @entity37 for years			2

@entity37 rules food made for community events is not covered by @entity43 safety rules
the move has been welcomed by professional chefs and amateur cooks alike
