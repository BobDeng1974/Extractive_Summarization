an incredible country estate with a 38 - bedroom main house , its own loch , a golf course and 19 other homes has been put on the market for £ 6million			1
the @entity8 , in the @entity7 , was earmarked to become the world 's most expensive private members club , with annual fees of £ 2million , and was dubbed the ' @entity12 of @entity13 '			1
but planning permission was rejected and the owner , @entity15 , decided to continue to use it as a family home			1
the @entity8 is bigger than many villages - and comes with @entity37 , its own loch , an assault course , an old golf course , a boat shed , a boat house , dormitories and 19 additional homes			1
there are labs , a hydro power station and even an indoor sports centre with its own five - a - side football pitch on the estate - which dates back to 1346 and is located on the south shore of @entity52 in @entity53			1
the sprawling property is dominated by the 38 - bedroom main home and whoever takes over the estate gets riparian rights on the loch			1
the owner is @entity15 , a secretive cornishman who made his millions in property speculation			1
he bought the property for around £ 1.3million in 2002			2
view of the castle : the main building has 38 rooms and is currently occupied by its enigmatic multi-millionaire owner @entity15 views of the loch : the site offers stunning views of @entity52 , pictured above , in @entity53 mr @entity15 bought the estate in 2003			1
it had previously been @entity75 , whose former pupils include the current @entity78			0
the @entity8 , now on the market for £ 6million , was previously @entity75 - until the institution closed in 2002			1
the school was founded in 1959 and was immediately welcomed as the perfect private school environment for a robust regime of outdoor pursuits			2
pupils flocked to the remote surroundings with its beautiful lochside setting			0
but by 1999 , many parents were questioning the value of a boarding school education and the only private schools that were flourishing were those that could guarantee top grades and a ready supply of day pupils			2
@entity97 performed averagely in exams and was seen as too remote by most parents			0
from a high of around 300 pupils , by 2001 the school roll had declined to just 140			0
but the private school , opened in 1959 , was forced to close in 2002 due to falling numbers and insurmountable debts			2
the businessman had hoped to turn @entity8 into a playground for billionaires and , in 2009 , unveiled ambitious plans for the ultimate private members club			1
he wanted to charge people £ 2million per year to be a member , leading to the proposed site being dubbed the ' @entity12 '			1
the entrepreneur boasted about how @entity115 would n't be able to afford to be a member , but he would be allowed to use the golf course ' as a guest '			1
but there were a number of protests and @entity122 and @entity123 voted against the plans			0
mr @entity15 uses the main mansion as his private home but has now instructed @entity127 to sell the entire estate for more than £ 6million			1
@entity129 , boss of @entity127 , today described it as ' a really special place with fantastic history '			0
he said : ' a clan seat estate is a very rare thing and i hope someone spots its potential as a corporate retreat or a hotel			2
' now the referendum has been decided it is time to find it a new owner			2
we have interest from all over the world and finding a buyer is very much what i aim to do			0
' it is likely to attract wealthy hoteliers from @entity151 but it would also be an ideal billionaire 's retreat			2
the estate has so much			0
it practically has the services you would find in a small town			0
' there is the old golf course , curling rink , chapel , sports centre , hydro station and even a small library			0
' the estate lies on the edge of the ancient @entity168 of @entity52 , which is one of the largest remnants of ice age forests in @entity172			0
