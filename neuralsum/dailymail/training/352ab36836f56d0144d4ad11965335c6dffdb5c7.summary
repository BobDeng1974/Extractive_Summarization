@entity0 will provide a clue to their one - day strategy for their forthcoming seven - match series in @entity4 when they omit @entity5 from their top three in friday 's warm - up game against @entity4 a in @entity8			1
the 25 - year - old @entity10 opener , who is currently third in the @entity14 's @entity13 world rankings , has been touted by many as a potential match - winner at next year 's 50 - over @entity17 in @entity18 and @entity19			1
but @entity0 are set instead to go in to their tour opener with a top three of captain @entity22 , @entity21 and @entity23 – leaving them open once more to the accusation that their approach to one - day cricket is simply too conservative to challenge the world 's best sides			1
@entity5 , pictured during a nets session in @entity8 , will not be part of @entity0 's top three against @entity4 @entity10 opener @entity5 is currently ranked third in the @entity14 's @entity13 world rankings @entity5 has played just four one - day internationals , all against @entity34 at the end of the summer , when he made only 92 runs at a strike - rate of 68 , with a top score of 42			1
but four games is hardly a scientific sample , and many still remember his breath - taking unbeaten 116 from 64 balls to dispatch the @entity44 during the @entity13 earlier this year in @entity45			0
as one six after another flew into the @entity49 night sky , it seemed @entity0 had unearthed a world - beater for both forms of limited - overs cricket			2
in his next match against @entity4 – another @entity13 game at @entity56 in may – he top - scored with 66 from 41 balls , with no other @entity0 batsman reaching 30			2
it is fair to say he is the one @entity0 player the @entity44 truly fear			0
yet coach @entity60 and @entity22 took note of @entity5 's struggles against the tight line served up by @entity34 's opening bowlers in august and september , and have also borne in mind the spin option provided by @entity21 in a part of the world where slow bowlers need little encouragement			1
coach @entity60 , pictured during a nets session on thursday , could be accused of being too conservative captain @entity22 ( right ) will make up part of @entity0 's top three with @entity21 and @entity23 even so , for those looking for signs that @entity0 will embrace an aggression - first approach as they seek to avoid a sixth successive @entity17 flop , the news that @entity5 is not being given a licence to thrill at the top of the order will feel dispiriting			1
at a training session at the @entity83 in @entity8 today , @entity60 said : ' we 're trying to move to be a more positive side , with both bat and ball , take every opportunity to score runs and put pressure on the opposition			0
' it 's not a simple process to say " i 'm going to walk out and whack it "			0
' we saw that in that @entity34 game , when @entity97 [ who made 264 against @entity4 at @entity98 ] started slowly , and then suddenly found freedom and played beautifully			0
@entity21 ( left ) and @entity23 ( right ) will complete @entity0 's top three in friday 's warm - up match against @entity4 a ' we 've got to do that			1
it 's not actually complicated			0
you 've just got to find your way of doing it as an individual , and a team			0
' with only two warm - up games scheduled before wednesday 's first one - day international here in @entity8 , it looks as if @entity5 's best hope will be for @entity23 to fail twice			2
it is not the ideal sentiment at the start of a tour which @entity0 hope will provide them with a platform to shock the world in @entity18 and @entity19 .			0

@entity22 , @entity21 and @entity23 will make up @entity0 's top three
@entity5 is ranked third in the @entity14 's @entity13 world rankings
coach @entity60 once again open to accusations that @entity0 's approach is too conservative to challenge world 's best
