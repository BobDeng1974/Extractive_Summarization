by @entity1 reporter published : 22:22 est , 26 april 2013 updated : 02:38 est , 27 april 2013 ironic : while covering his medical marijuana beat , @entity2 accidentally ate high potency pot brownies a reporter with a beat in the seedy dealings of medical marijuana found himself swallowing a bitter pill as he accidentally got a taste of his own medicine and was forced to re-evaluate his notions of the pot world			1
though many journalists get wrapped up in their work , not a lot cover what @entity2 does			1
for the @entity18 and @entity19 , @entity2 has covered @entity21 ’s medical marijuana laws and booming pot industry for years			1
in 2010 , he spent the day in @entity23 with a pot dealer turned business woman looking to reap the benefits of the state ’s newly loosened marijuana laws			1
‘ she let us follow her as she was doing her thing , ’ @entity2 said in a video produced by the @entity30 about the incident			1
he ’d gone to the woman ’s home , where she hosted a weekly gathering of weed enthusiasts			0
a doctor was on call to write marijuana prescriptions for those who needed them , bongs were packed and waiting in a back cottage , and food was available , some laced , some not			2
‘ it was brunch with pot , ’ he said			0
thinking he was merely indulging a sweet tooth , he indulged with his subjects			0
‘ i did n’t really pay close attention … so i ate the brownies			2
’ ‘ in a little bit of a hurry , ’ @entity2 left for the airport to catch a flight back to @entity63 shortly thereafter			2
but when he got there , something was n’t right			0
‘ it hits me , ’ he said			0
‘ i am , like , totally stoned			0
’ unfortunate : @entity2 boarded a @entity71 plane soon after the brownies kicked in , his first time on the unusually lit air carrier @entity2 managed to get on his flight , but even that did n’t seem normal			1
‘ i had never flown @entity71 before this trip , ’ he said			0
accidentally stoned , the reporter also happened to board what can only be described as the trippiest of all @entity82 air carriers			2
he boarded a cabin filled by moody purple and pink lights and trance music			0
‘ i got ta get out of this plane , ’ he recalled thinking			2
@entity2 quickly deboarded in a panic and found a lonely corner in @entity90 , where he attempted to just sleep it off			1
he even called his wife in hopes she could calm him down and she advised him just to wait things out			0
for four hours he experienced severe anxiety before he was able to ‘ even think about ’ boarding another plane			0
he ’d later learn that the marijuana brownies from the party were of a very high grade and even experienced users were encouraged to only eat a quarter to a half of the large dose confections			1
he ’d eaten two full brownies			0
but the experience , @entity2 said , was an educational one the experienced marijuana journalist had gotten a dose of his own bitter medicine			1
panicked : @entity2 ran off the plane and spent four hours in the airport that forced him to rethink his views on medical marijuana rethink : @entity2 wondered what a 16 - year - old in his position might have done and suggested that more regulation is a good thing ‘ [ it ] got me to think a lot harder about pot. ’ @entity2 said he now believes today ’s marijuana is a far cry from that of 20 or 30 years ago			1
‘ if i was a 16 year old kid and ate two of these brownies , ’ he wondered			2
‘ where would it leave me if i were driving a vehicle ? ’ right now , @entity2 said , medical marijuana is not closely regulated			1
he likely thinks that should change when he ’s in the @entity130 he calls home and commonly encounters the aroma of pot. ‘ every time i smell a joint , i still have that slight little pulse of panic			0

on *assignment* in the hemp *jungles* of @entity23 , @entity2 *inadvertently* ate what turned out to be marijuana brownies
after a panic - inducing experience trying to board a plane , the *veteran* journalist was forced to rethink how he feels about today *'s* changing laws on the drug
