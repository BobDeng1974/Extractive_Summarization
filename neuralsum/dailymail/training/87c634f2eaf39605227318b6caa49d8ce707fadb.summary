using robotics to perform surgery is increasingly common practice - they enable surgeons to perform the most delicate procedures with unprecedented precision but this ' robotic snake ' is a medical droid of a new species , as it slithers down a patient 's throat without needing incisions to gain access to certain parts of a body			1
it is hoped that the flexible device will soon be able to perform advanced procedures inside the human body			1
open wide ! the @entity21 is inserted into the throat to perform operations inside the human body known as the @entity21 , the design is based on research by @entity27 , professor of robotics at @entity29 , @entity30			1
the robot - assisted device is being developed by @entity34 - based company @entity33 originally the robot had been used to explore @entity37 ’s abandoned @entity36 nuclear power plant			1
but now this flexible endoscopic system will be used to give surgeons access to parts of the human body that are difficult to reach via other methods			1
this will enable more patients to get so - called minimally - invasive treatment , speeding up hospital waiting times			0
‘ the @entity21 is the first robot - assisted flexible endoscopic platform for use during surgical procedures , ’ dr @entity48 , president and ceo of @entity33 , said in a release			1
‘ the system enables surgeons to access and visualise hard - to - read anatomical locations			0
' in addition , the robotic snake can ' deploy specially designed flexible surgical instruments to perform procedures			2
’ the device ( pictured ) will primarily operate in the oropharynx ( the area between your mouth and the top of your throat ) and the endolarynx ( within the larynx )			2
but in the future it could also be used for more complex operations like heart procedures physicians use a joystick to steer the snake around organs and other obstacles after it has entered through the mouth			1
attached to the head is a high - definition camera so the physicians can see where it is going			1
the snake is made of linked segments that enable it to bend while remaining rigid			1
each link mimics the position of the one in front , preventing it from accidentally bumping into something as it moves through the body			0
either side of the camera are ports for small surgical instruments to be attached			2
these can be used to operate in confined spaces of the human body			1
it will primarily operate in the oropharynx ( the area between your mouth and the top of your throat ) and the endolarynx ( within the larynx )			0
but in the future it could also be used for more complex operations like heart procedures			2
@entity33 is in the process of marketing the device across @entity114 , where it could soon be making its way into hospitals			2
space scientists are planning to use robotic snakes to explore the hostile surface of @entity121			0
a team from the @entity123 in @entity124 , @entity125 , is studying how robosnakes could be used to gather samples from hard - to - reach places on the red planet			0
the work is part of a feasibility study by the @entity133 ( @entity133 ) which aims to provide greater mobility during space research than traditional rovers can provide			0
one idea is to use a conventional rover , such as @entity139 , to carry a robotic snake over large distances and then deploy it to places the rover ca n’t access			0
@entity144 's robot consists of 10 identical joint modules , each having two motorised degrees of freedom			0
the modules are covered by passive wheels to give the robot ground friction , which enables it to slither forward over flat surfaces .			0

surgical robot will be used for heart , neck and throat operations
the robosnake was made by @entity29 and @entity33
it is composed of linked segments that can *navigate* the human body
movements are controlled using an *external* joystick
tools can be attached to its head to grasp or cut body tissue
a *predecessor* was used to explore an abandoned nuclear power plant
