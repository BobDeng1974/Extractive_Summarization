the @entity2 @entity1 's arguments on tuesday over same - sex marriage will cap more than two decades of litigation and a transformation in public attitudes			1
based on the court 's actions during the past two years , a sense of inevitability is in the air : that a majority is on the verge of declaring gay marriage legal nationwide			1
justice @entity15 , the court 's pivotal member on gay rights , has been marching in this direction with opinions dating to 1996			2
in his most recent gay rights decision for the court in 2013 , rejecting a legal definition of marriage limited to a man and woman for purposes of federal benefits , @entity15 deplored that @entity2 law for making gay marriages ' unequal			1
when states appealed rulings striking down their same - sex marriage prohibitions , the @entity1 declined to intervene , most notably in october 2014 when it denied appeals in seven cases on a single day			0
instead , the nine justices are hearing in tuesday 's oral arguments an appeal of the sole decision from a regional @entity2 appeals court that went the opposite way			1
last november , the @entity56 - based @entity55 for the @entity57 upheld gay marriage bans in @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62			1
with 37 of the 50 states now permitting gay marriage , many because of judicial orders , it seems unlikely the country 's highest court would reverse course			1
public opinion polls over the last decade have shown large increases in support for gay marriage			1
a ruling is due by the end of june			0
how much will @entity15 , a member of the court 's five - man conservative bloc who often casts decisive votes in close cases , show his hand in the 2 - 1/2 hours of oral arguments ? will he reveal a clear view that the @entity85 gives gay people a right to marry or will he voice concerns for state interests in controlling marriage laws ? an element of uncertainty hovers over chief justice @entity93 , who broke with the other court conservatives and cast the deciding vote upholding president @entity97 's healthcare law in 2012			1
@entity93 voted against gay rights in the 2013 ruling			0
but he separated himself from the most conservative dissenters and declined to declare outright that states may ban gay marriage			1
he has demonstrated apprehension about the reputation of the court that , by virtue of his service as chief justice , informally bears his name			0
in his opinions , he has sometimes tried to lower tensions in controversial cases and reassure people that the court is aligning with precedent and public expectations			0
the question is not only how @entity93 might vote but what he might write			0
in the 2013 ruling , he denounced the court majority 's sentiment that federal lawmakers were deliberately harming gay people with the limited definition of marriage			1
' i would not tar the political branches with the brush of bigotry , ' he wrote			0
for the other seven justices , expectations are clearer			0
the four liberals , @entity131 , @entity132 , @entity133 and @entity134 , have signaled their opposition to state same - sex marriage bans			0
on the other side have been the three most conservative justices , @entity139 , @entity140 and @entity141 , asserting that nothing in the @entity85 guarantees same - sex marriage			0
two legal questions are before the justices : whether the @entity85 's guarantees of due process and equal protection cover a right to same - sex marriage ; and , if they do not , whether states that ban same - sex marriages must recognize such unions performed in other states			2
gay couples and their families , about 30 adults and 20 children , have appealed the @entity57 's decision			2
the name petitioner is @entity162 , who wanted his home state of @entity59 , which prohibits gay marriage , to recognize his @entity166 marriage to @entity167 as @entity167 was dying from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , also known as @entity170 's disease			2
officials expect the courtroom to be packed to its 400 - seat capacity			0
lines for general spectator seats began forming around 6am on friday , more than four days ahead of the scheduled oral arguments at 10am on tuesday .			2
