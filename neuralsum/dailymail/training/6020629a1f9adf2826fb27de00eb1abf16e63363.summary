by @entity0 sweating in the spring sun , it took @entity4 several trips to load all his bags and belongings on to the huge blue and white train			2
his wife @entity8 tried to calm one of their young children who was screaming , while a second child stood watching beside their small dog			2
finally , @entity4 folded up a pushchair and with a quick glance towards a gang of @entity18 militia in red armbands , boarded for @entity20			2
‘ when guns are pointed at you and your family , it does not feel wise to stay , ’ said the hotel manager from @entity22 , on the @entity24 coast			2
no choice ? @entity30 will not have the option to stay with @entity32 in the vote			1
the referendum asks : do they support joining @entity36 or do they support @entity24 becoming independent from @entity32 ? the family is fleeing the region following the @entity36 invasion and anticipated annexation , fearful of the future and potential for conflict			1
‘ we are being forced to become @entity36 , ’ said @entity4 , 40			1
‘ i worry for @entity24 – there will be nothing here			2
’ he is not alone			2
with flights cancelled to everywhere except @entity51 , the railway station has seen scores of these sad scenes in recent days as men send their families to safety			2
on friday , i found oil company executive @entity58 waving off his wife and two children for the long trip across @entity32 to @entity62			1
‘ i wish i was not standing here , ’ he said			0
‘ i have lived in @entity24 for ten years and we have never had any problems			0
but now my children are being abused and i do n’t like it			0
’ he spoke in @entity32 – unusual these days on @entity69 ’s streets , since such speakers say they are being threatened			1
so when would his family be returning ? ‘ if @entity24 goes to @entity36 they will not come back , ’ he said			1
‘ and i will have to go also			0
’ sadly for @entity58 and many like him , the region does seem set to join @entity36 after a sham referendum set to be held today under the sinister shadow of an invading army			1
indeed , even as @entity58 ’s family boarded the train , a vast new @entity36 flag was being unfurled in front of the supposedly independent @entity24 parliament ahead of the ballot			1
although the voting paper contains two questions , it does not offer @entity30 the option to remain @entity32 but asks them to choose from one of two other options			1
firstly , it asks : ‘ do you support joining @entity24 with the @entity36 as a subject of @entity36 ? ’ ' the only people who will bother to vote want to join @entity36 , ' says @entity32 - speaking @entity24 man @entity58 and secondly : ‘ do you support restoration of the @entity94 , and @entity24 ’s status as part of @entity32 ? ’ the wording is clever since the 1992 constitution originally sought by all pro-russian militants stated that @entity24 is independent and not part of @entity32			1
a reference to autonomy within @entity32 was inserted later at the behest of @entity20			1
so supporting option two is actually backing enhanced independence and the puppet government that would ensure this is under @entity36			1
‘ i will not vote – there is no point , ’ said @entity107 , a 28 - year - old charity worker			2
‘ the only people who will bother are those who want to join @entity36			1
’ many in the @entity32 minority that makes up almost a quarter of @entity24 ’s population say they will leave			1
' if @entity24 joins @entity36 , the only ones who will stay are those without the money to leave ' ‘ yesterday , a woman who works for me called and said she could not come to work , ’ said @entity117 , the owner of a thriving agricultural business			1
‘ she had left and gone to @entity121 with her two children			0
’ now @entity117 , who spent three years of his life fighting for the @entity124 in @entity125 , says he will follow suit			0
‘ they have poisoned this place for us , ’ he told me , as his two daughters arrived home from school			0
‘ of course it would be very difficult to leave because we have a business , money in the bank , a nice home – but we will leave if the @entity36 take over even if we lose everything			1
’ like many in @entity24 , he has strong ties of family and friendship that cross borders			0
‘ but these are not the @entity36 we love – they are occupants of our country , ’ he said			1
@entity147 , a 46 - year - old paediatrician and mother - of - four , said she knew 15 families planning to leave			2
she has seen critics of @entity36 assaulted in the street and has been harassed at home by gangs of youths seeking her teenage daughter , a political activist			1
‘ i work with 200 children with @entity158 and it will be very hard to leave them , ’ she said			0
‘ but if @entity24 joins @entity36 , the only ones who will stay are those without the money to leave			1
families are fleeing to avoid what they claim will be a form of oppression in @entity36 - run @entity24 ‘ i do n’t want to live in @entity36 but this vote has been decided already			1
it will ruin @entity24 and a lot of my acquaintances are very scared – no one asked our opinion before bringing in these troops			0
’ her daughter @entity175 , 18 , a student doctor who has been attacked at a protest , joined a 500 - strong underground self - defence group			2
its activities include stockpiling body armour and medical supplies in case of conflict and disseminating anti-russian leaflets during the night			0
‘ i am not afraid because i love my country , ’ she said			0
‘ i want to live in @entity32			1
but if there is nothing we can do i will leave too			0
’ @entity188 was born in the @entity36 @entity189 yet joined a @entity191 demonstration last week			1
‘ i want @entity24 to remain with @entity32 , ’ he said			1
‘ no one is thinking about the repercussions			0
we are all afraid of war			0
’ bizarrely , i have discovered that @entity51 is carrying out market research into its incursion – which must surely be a first in the annals of invasion			0
all sides in @entity24 are trying hard to avoid rash actions that could spark bloodshed but many @entity204 – a @entity206 minority deported by @entity207 70 years ago – are terrified by life under @entity36			1
and the biggest concerns are over the roving bands of samoobrona – pro-russian militia – – that sprung up after the invasion			0
i spoke to the commander of one unit of 15 samoobrona standing outside the @entity215			0
a builder by trade , @entity216 admitted he had received no training and said the force – just three weeks old – was already 2,500 - strong in @entity69 alone			2
he claimed to be guarding the city against ‘ fascists ’ and ‘ provocateurs ’ – and said that they would stay as long as they were needed			0
‘ little boys have come up to thank us for keeping them safe , ’ he added with a smile			0
but as he talked , an elderly woman in a woolly hat and stained coat approached us			0
‘ who are you protecting us from ? ’ she asked , ignoring his attempts to push her away			0
‘ i do n’t see any of these provocations you all talk about			0
’ there are none , of course , but it is almost certainly too late			0
@entity241 and his stooges are finalising their seizure of @entity24 today and there seems little that @entity32 or its @entity246 allies are able or willing to do to stop it .			2

cleverly - worded referendum asks to join @entity36 or become independent
@entity32 - speaking @entity30 fleeing what they brand ' oppressive regime '
