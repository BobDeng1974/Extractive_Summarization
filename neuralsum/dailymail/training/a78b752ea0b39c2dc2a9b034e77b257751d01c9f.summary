women who use the internet to seek boyfriends will win the right to force the police to reveal if they have a history of violence under plans being considered by home secretary @entity8			1
the controversial move is in response to fears that the growing phenomenon of internet dating means more and more women are going out with men whose backgrounds they know little about			1
the proposal has been called ‘ @entity22 ’ , after the horrific killing of 36 - year - old mother @entity19 by a man she met on @entity21			1
@entity23 strangled ms @entity19 and set her body on fire before hanging himself			1
horrific killing : @entity19 was strangled and set on fire by her former boyfriend @entity23 , who she met on @entity21 friends and family were shocked to discover that the killer had a history of violence against women , including repeated harassment , threats and the kidnapping at knifepoint of one of his other ex-girlfriends			1
a @entity19 ’s law campaign is to be launched tomorrow			1
it is modelled on @entity43 ’ , the successful fight to give parents the right to check on paedophiles in their area after the murder of schoolgirl @entity50			0
in a letter seen by @entity53 , mrs may indicates she is considering introducing @entity22 and will make an announcement in the next few weeks			0
she says : ‘ tackling violence against women and girls is a priority for this government			2
’ however , some believe the well - intentioned plan could jeopardise civil liberties			2
@entity64 mp @entity63 , a member of the @entity65 , said : ‘ we ’re all in favour of curbing violence against women but we have to be certain this will not lead to fishing expeditions by women demanding confidential information about potential boyfriends without proper justification			2
history of violence : @entity23 was discovered hanged six days after @entity19 's body was found ‘ you can not have a carte blanche system where people can simply turn up at a police station , give the name of a boyfriend or potential boyfriend , and expect the police to open up all the files on him			1
there will have to be strict controls on any proposal of this nature			0
’ supporters of @entity22 insist that there would be safeguards to prevent any such abuse			0
but @entity96 , the government ’s victims ’ commissioner , said : ‘ our priority should not be protecting a perpetrator ’s privacy at the expense of costing a woman ’s life			0
’ the @entity22 campaign is being led by former labour cabinet minister @entity106 and ms @entity19 ’s father , @entity107			1
mr @entity107 , 67 , a former prison officer , last night told @entity53 he would do ‘ anything i can ’ to get the proposals agreed , adding : ‘ there needs to be greater protection			1
’ he also said : ‘ my daughter was n’t stupid			0
if she had known about that man ’s past , she would have taken herself out of there in a heartbeat			2
’ former home office minister ms @entity106 , who was ms @entity19 ’s mp , said the launch just a few weeks ago of a national police database made @entity22 checks simple to carry out			1
the @entity121 mp said : ‘ women in @entity19 ’s situation often are unaware of their partner ’s previous relationships and this can mean they start a relationship with someone with no idea if they have a violent past			1
until women are given the right to know if their partner has a history of serial domestic abuse , they ca n’t be sure of the risk that they face			2
‘ by changing the law we can empower women so that they can take informed action about their relationship and give them the chance to protect themselves			2
’ inspiration : ' @entity22 ' has been modelled on @entity43 ' , which was introduced after the murder of schoolgirl @entity50 ms @entity106 pointed out that a survey showed overwhelming backing for @entity22 , with 91 per cent of women consulted saying a person had the right to know if their partner had a recorded history of domestic violence			1
the radical proposals are based on recommendations by @entity158 chief constable @entity157 , who speaks for the @entity159 on violence against women			2
the draft @entity22 scheme would include allowing women with concerns about their partners to apply to their local police station for information on any violent past			0
more controversially , police would proactively warn women that their partner was a potential danger			0
police sources stressed that information would be released only by police officers of inspector rank and above , and after they were fully satisfied someone ’s concerns about their partner was genuine			0
home secretary @entity8 is considering introducing ' @entity22 ' , which will force the police to tell women if their partner has a history of violence after the inquest into ms @entity19 ’s death , coroner @entity182 wrote to the @entity185 to recommend a system of checks which has become the basis of @entity22			1
ms @entity19 was initially charmed by @entity190 ’s persona after meeting him online , but his violent side soon surfaced and he subjected her to a string of sexual assaults			1
after they split he strangled her and set on fire in @entity121 in february 2009			0
when he went on the run he was quickly dubbed the ‘ @entity197 ’			0
six days after ms @entity19 ’s body was found , @entity190 was discovered hanged in a derelict pub. ms @entity19 had first called police in october 2008 after he damaged her front door , threatened her with an iron and threatened to kill her			2
the @entity204 later ruled she had been badly let down by police			0
last night , sources close to the home secretary said : ‘ we ’re looking into this although no final decision has yet been made			0
’ @entity210 was rolled out last year to give parents the legal right to know if anyone with regular access to children posed a risk			0
it followed the murder of @entity50 by paedophile @entity219 in 2000 .			0
