when @entity1 leads the @entity2 out for the 100th time on saturday it will cement his status as one of the greatest sporting captains to have lived			1
@entity1 , who led @entity2 to the @entity7 , has been captain of his country since 2006 , and led the @entity2 out on several occasions before being given the full - time job aged 25			1
now 33 and in the twilight of his career , questions of @entity1 's legacy are becoming increasingly poignant , especially ahead of saturday 's landmark clash against @entity17 in @entity18			1
@entity1 - seen here parading the @entity7 in 2011 - will lead the @entity2 for the 100th time one such question is : where does he rank among the greatest international sporting captains of all time ? well , @entity24 has come up with a top 10 , which unsurprisingly includes the @entity2 great			1
you 're sure to disagree with some of the names on the list and certainly the order , so feel free to leave a comment below ... 10 ) @entity32 ( @entity33 , cricket ) @entity35 and @entity36 led @entity33 through a period of utter domination of world cricket through the 1990s and 2000s but none of that would have been possible without @entity32			2
inheriting a side in utter disarray in the mid- 1980s , by the time @entity32 had retired in 1994 @entity33 were playing the brand of dogged , determined cricket that has brought them so much success since			2
the @entity48 are made in his image			0
@entity33 captain @entity32 embodied his team 's battling spirit in the late 80s and early 90s 9 ) @entity54 ( @entity53 , rugby union ) to describe the @entity55 as a @entity53 legend would not do his impact on the 15 - man game in the @entity60 justice			2
the big second row toured with the @entity53 five times between 1962 and 1974 and still holds the record for number of appearances in the famous red jersey at 17			0
@entity67 captained the @entity53 on their most successful tour to date - a 3 - 0 whitewash of @entity70 in 1974			2
@entity54 in action against @entity70 and returning home from the successful tour 8 ) @entity74 ( @entity75 , cricket ) scourge of the @entity77 , @entity74 was the mastermind behind the infamous ' @entity80 ' tactic which saw @entity75 nullify the threat of the peerless @entity82 and regain the @entity83 in 1932 - 33			0
a fierce competitor , the ultra-competitive @entity74 reportedly ordered his players to ' hate the @entity77 ' and to refer to @entity82 as ' the little bastard '			0
he lost just one of 15 tests as captain			0
@entity74 ( left ) and his @entity77 counterpart @entity90 ahead of the third test in 1933 7 ) @entity92 ( @entity75 , football ) on to the first of our footballers and @entity75 's 1966 @entity7 - winning captain @entity92			1
a calm , assured presence at the back , @entity92 became @entity75 's youngest ever captain when first handed the armband in 1963 aged just 22			2
a year later , he was handed the full - time role and would retain it until the last of his 108 caps in 1973			2
ninety of those caps came as captain - an @entity108 joint - record held with @entity109			0
@entity92 ( right ) kisses the @entity111 trophy after @entity75 's @entity7 triumph in 1966 6 ) @entity113 ( @entity114 , football ) @entity113 just pips his great rival @entity92 by virtue of the fact he led his country to two major trophies , rather than one			1
like @entity92 , @entity113 was a stylish defender , perhaps even more comfortable with the ball than without it			0
on the losing side as @entity92 lifted the @entity111 trophy in 1966 , ' @entity113 ' would have his time			0
made captain in 1971 , he led his country to the @entity127 in 1972 and , his crowning glory , the @entity7 in 1974			1
@entity113 ( left ) guided @entity114 to the @entity7 two years after winning @entity129 72 5 ) @entity1 ( @entity2 , rugby union ) sorry @entity1 , but we ca n't get you any higher than no 5			1
one hundred tests as captain and a @entity7 triumph speak for themselves , but that choke against @entity137 in the 2007 quarter - final when the @entity2 looked destined for glory is the one blot in his copybook as captain			1
@entity1 will have the chance of redemption next year at the @entity7 on these shores and should he lift the @entity147 trophy again , he may just find himself at @entity148			1
@entity1 's @entity2 delivered @entity2 their first @entity7 since 1987 three years ago 4 ) @entity149 ( @entity150 , football ) a controversial choice			1
those football aficionados among you may wonder how @entity149 is above @entity113 and @entity92			0
sure , @entity149 is arguably the greatest footballer of all - time but his leadership qualities are not immediately obvious , especially compared with those two stalwarts - the argument goes			1
but it is exactly that prodigious ability which carried an otherwise average @entity150 team to @entity7 glory in 1986			1
@entity149 led by the most supreme of examples that summer			0
@entity149 was in sensational form throughout the 1986 @entity7 3 ) sir @entity166 ( @entity165 , cricket ) back to cricket , and with it one of the most iconic figures the game has known			1
like @entity74 , @entity172 was a prickly figure as skipper , never shirking a confrontation and doing everything in his power to win ( and he was n't bad with the bat either )			0
under @entity172 ' captaincy , which lasted for 50 tests from 1984 to 1991 , @entity165 never lost a series			0
sir @entity166 was the leader of an iconic @entity165 team in the 1980s 2 ) @entity183 ( @entity184 , football ) the name ' @entity183 ' does n't scream out at you when asked who the greatest sporting captains of all - time are , especially in the wake of @entity184 's and his dismal @entity7 this year			1
but just look at his record : @entity183 captained @entity184 to three consecutive major trophies - @entity194 , the @entity195 and @entity196			0
a feat unrivalled in national football captaincy ( although @entity113 came within a penalty shootout of doing the same at @entity200 )			0
@entity183 - seen here lifting the @entity7 in 2010 - captained @entity184 through a period of dominance 1 ) @entity203 ( @entity53 and @entity75 , rugby union ) we 've seen three types of criteria that make great sporting captains : trophies , such as @entity183 ; character , such as @entity74 ; and skill , such as @entity149			1
all 10 of the sportsmen on these list have elements of each , but none have all in such an abundance as did @entity203			0
@entity203 's leadership and motivational qualities were second to none during his playing career and he was unrivalled as the greatest lock on the planet until his retirement			2
and he has the medals to go with it : a @entity7 in 2003 and a @entity53 series win touring @entity70 , who were then - world champions			2
he captained both sides , of course			0
@entity203 captained both the @entity53 ( left ) and @entity75 ( right ) to memorable successes			0
