house speaker @entity0 lashed out at the @entity2 administration on wednesday for issuing the latest in a long series of @entity5 delays , giving prospective enrollees another half - month to signup for insurance coverage through the @entity5 website , healthcare.gov			1
' what the hell is this , a joke ? ' an incredulous @entity0 said during his regular wednesday press conference on @entity13 in @entity14 he said the @entity15 has been reduced to treating the law 's march 31 regulatory deadline as a formality – ' another deadline rendered meaningless , ' he mocked – allowing weeks of extra time for @entity21 who claim they tried in earnest to sign up before the deadline			1
' the dates are the dates , and the law is the law , ' @entity0 said , answering a reporter 's question about why @entity21 should n't have more time			2
' the president does n't have the authority to change the law whenever he wants , which he continues to do			2
' the law says that enrollment stops at the end of march			1
that ’s what the law says , ' he said later , sticking up for @entity64 ' part in the four - year - long @entity5 saga			1
' i 've got to live by the law			0
you 've got to live by the law			0
the @entity21 people have got to live by the law			2
and guess what ? the president needs to live by the law as well			2
' a source inside the @entity76 who is familiar with tuesday 's decision told @entity78 that the agency has not determined what the new cutoff date will be			0
but the insider said that @entity76 was not likely to fix april 15 as the revised zero - hour since it would coincide with the @entity84 's deadline for individual income tax filings			2
cries of hypocrisy rang out tuesday night when the news was leaked , with some online commentators comparing the move to leaving @entity92 polls open for extra days in order to accommodate people who claim they meant to vote on time			0
' if @entity5 was a good law , the president would n't need to break the law nearly every week to implement it , ' texas sen. @entity96 said			1
' rather than issue yet another extension , the president should admit his law does not work and waive @entity5 for all @entity21			1
once it ’s repealed , we can work together to put health care reforms in place that empower , not limit , the consumer , provide more choices , and expand access to better care			0
' @entity111 spokeswoman @entity110 insisted in a schizophrenic statement that “ [ o ] pen enrollment ends march 31 , ' but then added that @entity39 is ' experiencing a surge in demand and are making sure that we will be ready to help consumers who may be in line by the deadline to complete enrollment – either online or over the phone			1
' @entity125 chairman @entity124 , in @entity126 for the state party 's spring conference , mocked the latest delay and predicted it would have political consequences in november @entity15 spokesman @entity130 hinted at the development last friday , telling reporters during a daily briefing that the administration wanted ensure that ' people who are already in line can finish their enrollment			1
' an 11th - hour delay was treated as outside the realm of possibility just two weeks ago , however			0
during a march 12 congressional hearing , hhs secretary @entity38 told @entity143 @entity142 rep. @entity142 that there would be no such extensions			0
' are you going to delay the open enrollment beyond march 31 ? ' @entity142 asked			1
' no , sir , ' she replied			0
on the same day , @entity148 , a spokeswoman for the @entity76 – the agency charged with implementing the @entity5 law – told reporters that ' we have no plans to extend the open enrollment period ' that began disastrously on october 1			1
' in fact , we do n't actually have the statutory authority to extend the open enrollment period in 2014 , ' she said			1
@entity76 spokeswoman @entity148 told reporters two weeks ago that @entity39 does n't have the legal authority to budge the open - enrollment zero hour into april during the march 12 hearing before the @entity40 , chairman @entity161 asked @entity38 if she agreed with that assessment			1
' i have n’t seen their statements , ' she replied , despite having been on the conference call , ' but there is no delay beyond march 31			1
' the @entity2 administration leaked the latest tactical shift after 8:00 p.m. tuesday night while president @entity2 was sleeping in @entity172 , @entity173 , and first lady @entity174 was beginning the day in @entity175 , @entity176 during part of a three - city tour			1
@entity125 chairman @entity124 leapt into the political opening immediately , releasing a dismissive statement			0
' another day , another @entity5 delay from the same @entity2 administration that wo n't work with republicans to help @entity21 suffering from the unintended consequences of the @entity186 ' failed healthcare law , ' he said ' @entity186 in leadership may say they are doubling down on @entity5 but you have to wonder how many more unilateral delays their candidates running in 2014 can withstand			1
' the @entity15 has struggled to enroll the 7 million @entity21 @entity38 has put forward as a goal			2
' i think success looks like at least 7 million people having signed up by the end of march 2014 , ' @entity38 said during an @entity198 interview in september 2013			0
later , the administration ratcheted that number down to 6 million , and lower still			0
if the nebulous targets were a series of goalpost - moving exercises , tuesday 's move will be seen as a sudden extension of @entity5 's game clock			2
the @entity207 reported that the extension past march 31 ' will rely on an honor system , ' requiring users only to check a blue box on the federal government 's health insurance enrollment website to indicate that they made good - faith efforts to meet the original deadline			1
' the government will not try to determine whether the person is telling the truth , ' said the @entity207			0
some states that are running their own online insurance marketplaces are expected to make similar arrangements , but others will not			0
@entity21 who are n't insured by the final , absolute deadline – a date that remains uncertain despite four years of planning and regulating – will face penalties in the form of new taxes on their income , unless that , too , is not strictly enforced			2
@entity0 lashed out at @entity2 for treating the march 31 deadline , a date prescribed by the @entity5 law 's text , as a moveable suggestion instead of a red line once the @entity2 administration 's open enrollment period is finally in the rear - view mirror , it will likely have to answer the thorny question of how many enrollees have actually begun their coverage by paying first - month 's premiums			1
the @entity15 has repeatedly declined to release that information , claiming the administration has n't collected those statistics			2
but rep. @entity161 and @entity40 health subcommittee chairman rep. @entity142 lobbed a broadside at @entity38 on tuesday , saying they have ' new evidence ' proving the contrary is true			0
“ new evidence obtained by the @entity40 strongly suggests that the @entity258 knows who has enrolled and paid their first month ’s premium , ' the two @entity256 lawmakers wrote to the @entity39 secretary			0
' in fact , there is specific information about who has paid their premium that @entity76 ( @entity76 ) is collecting and using to make payments to insurers			0
' ' we have recently obtained information that suggests your most recent testimony before the @entity40 was at best evasive and perhaps misleading , ' they charged , explaining that ' [ i ] nsurers are submitting information to @entity76 about who has effectuated their enrollment , i.e. , who has paid their premium			0
' ' please provide this information in its most updated form immediately			0

the @entity111 is allowing @entity21 who use healthcare.gov to blow off the march 31 enrollment deadline
republicans of all stripes are *reacting* with contempt , saying the president and his staff are breaking the law and defying @entity64
just check a box and say you tried to sign up for @entity5 before march 31 , and the system will give you a few more weeks
the @entity2 administration has pulled out all the stops to boost its numbers before the six - month open enrollment period ends
the @entity15 has repeatedly lowered expectations by shifting its target numbers – and by delaying talking about how many have paid for coverage
