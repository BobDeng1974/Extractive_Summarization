by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 09:03 est , 29 october 2013 updated : 09:05 est , 29 october 2013 the government is changing the law to drive through @entity5 changes after losing a court battle to close services at a @entity9 hospital			1
the @entity10 ruled today that health secretary @entity11 does not have the power to implement the cuts at the successful @entity14 in south east @entity9			1
but mr @entity11 said ministers are ‘ now looking at the law ’ to ensure changes can be driven through in future ‘ when local doctors believe it is in the interests of patients ’			1
warning : health secretary @entity11 said the government would change the law to make it clear that @entity5 changes can be made supporters of the @entity14 hospital cheered when the judges at the @entity10 backed an earlier ruling that mr @entity11 's move to downgrade @entity30 and maternity services was ‘ unlawful ’			1
@entity31 , the @entity32 , sitting with @entity33 and @entity34 , rejected an appeal brought by the government			2
campaigners said they were ‘ absolutely delighted ’ by the result			0
@entity38 , who represented the @entity39 , said : ‘ it confirms what the @entity41 has been arguing from the start - that the secretary of state did not have the legal power to close and downgrade services at @entity14			2
‘ this expensive waste of time for the government should serve as a wake up call that they can not ride roughshod over the needs of the people			0
’ mr @entity11 's decision to close the services in @entity14 were quashed in july , when mr @entity56 declared that the government had breached provisions of the @entity58 2006			1
the ruling was a serious blow for mr @entity11 because the case involved the first legal testing of a new @entity49 procedure for dealing with failing @entity5 organisations - referred to as the @entity65			2
the @entity10 today upheld a ruling at the @entity67 in july under the new regime , mr @entity11 had appointed a @entity69 ( @entity70 ) to the ‘ very badly performing ’ @entity71 , which went into administration after it started losing more than £ 1 million a week			1
to help deal with the problem , the special administrator recommended measures including cuts at @entity14			0
mr @entity11 told @entity77 in january that @entity30 and maternity services at the hospital would be downgraded			1
he assured mps the changes would improve patient care in south @entity9 , saving up to 100 lives a year , but gave an undertaking not to implement them pending the legal challenge			1
today mr @entity11 said : ‘ i completely understand why the residents of @entity14 did not want any change in their @entity30 services , but my job as health secretary is to protect patients across south @entity9 - and doctors said these proposals would save lives			1
‘ we are now looking at the law to make sure that , at a time of great challenge , the @entity5 is able to change and innovate when local doctors believe it is in the interests of patients			0
’ an amendment is being made to the @entity103 currently going through @entity77 to avoid a repeat of the legal challenge			0
it will clarify that if changes need to be made at other hospitals they can be driven through , although it will not be retrospective so will not affect @entity14 directly			0
but @entity111 mp , @entity112 's shadow health secretary , said : ‘ this decision is a humiliation for @entity11 and raises major questions about his judgment			1
‘ instead of graciously accepting the first court ruling , he has squandered thousands of ( pounds of ) taxpayers ' money trying to protect his own pride and defend the indefensible			0
he is diminished by this ruling and has let down the @entity5			0
‘ the court has done an important public service today in standing up to an arrogant and high - handed government and a secretary of state who is trying to close a&es across @entity9 in the middle of the worst @entity30 crisis in living memory			1
’ delight : campaigners welcomed the ruling which means that ' @entity14 is now safe and this case is now over ' @entity135 , who has been involved in the campaign from the outset , was jubilant to be told by lawyers : ‘ @entity14 is now safe and this case is now over			2
’ the mother of three young children , aged two , three and six , said : ‘ we are absolutely over the moon			0
we are thrilled that justice has prevailed for a second time			0
‘ i was shocked that the government was arrogant and foolish enough to carry on and try and bully through the closure of our excellent much - needed @entity14			0
‘ the judgment made in july was very clear indeed - that they acted unlawfully - so this is a disgraceful waste of taxpayers ' money by @entity11			2
’ she said the government had brought a last - minute amendment to the @entity103 giving trust special administrators ( @entity155 ) much greater powers , which meant no hospital in the country would be safe and showed a ‘ contempt for normal people and democracy ’			2
‘ we are not against change in @entity14 but against the dangerous closure of vital services being rushed through without proper consultation			0

cuts to services at south @entity9 hospital ruled unlawful by @entity67
now the government has lost an appeal against the decision in july
health secretary @entity11 says law will be changed to prevent a repeat
campaigners express their delight that @entity181 is ' now safe '
