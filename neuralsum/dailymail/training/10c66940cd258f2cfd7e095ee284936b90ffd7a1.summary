@entity0 claimed @entity1 had been made a worldwide scapegoat by @entity3 during an extraordinary press conference at the @entity5 on friday evening			1
@entity0 read a pre-prepared 13 - minute statement to claim that pressure from the @entity9 media after he bit @entity11 defender @entity10 last tuesday forced @entity3 to ban him for four months			1
the @entity13 coach then immediately quit his position on @entity3 ’s technical committee and told @entity1 that he has the full support of his country ’s people			1
@entity0 was then applauded out of the press auditorium by fawning @entity21 journalists			1
it is the contribution made by great football players is essential			2
‘ as a coach and a professor , and as a former teacher , i am presented with the theory of the scapegoat			2
you know what i am talking about , of giving a punishment , to someone who commits a transgression , not a crime			0
‘ we know the protagonists and not only because of the profile he has because of the mistakes , but there is another side to him			0
that is a message : the severity was excessive			2
‘ perhaps i do have the answers but like many people , those who not only have to make disciplinary decisions - who wins ? who loses ? who benefits ? who is harmed ? who got things their way ? ‘ to one of these questions , i will not give you a final answer , but i will try to find a response			2
on the basis of these exaggerated decisions , only with decisions of this nature i doubt it			0
after the @entity1 and @entity10 episode we have seen other things measured with a different measure			1
‘ when that happens we have the omission because not all cases have to do with the transgression with indiscipline			0
unavoidably this leads to exaggeration in terms of punishment			0
‘ we should punish and sanction , but one must always give the opportunity to hear from the person			0
’ @entity0 was highly critical of @entity3 ’s disciplinary panel after they failed to give @entity1 the chance to speak for himself after the incident with @entity10			1
bite marks : @entity11 's @entity10 shows his shoulder where he claimed @entity1 bit him tooth ache : @entity1 fell to the ground and held his teeth after the encounter with @entity10 the incident : @entity1 connects with @entity10 's shoulder in @entity13 's 1 - 0 win over @entity11 the @entity13 coach , preparing for saturday ’s @entity123 second round match against @entity124 in the @entity5 , urged the country ’s supporters to ‘ rebel ’ against the decision			1
@entity0 said : ‘ and to conclude to @entity1 , the person , the person who has always co-existeed with us and we know him better than anyone else , the path that he covered is a path that he will go through attempting to start again to be better			1
‘ to let him know that he will never be alone in that attempt			0
to the @entity21 fans , they are moved with the sanctions and to let them know we are hurt with an outstanding force and with the desire to rebel			2
so more than ever before we will do our utmost			0
’ @entity0 then went on to explain the reasons behind his decision to quit a @entity3 technical study group			1
he said : ‘ we have the right to express our opinions as coach of @entity13 representing us at this @entity123			2
‘ i trained and grew up in @entity13 as a footballer and a coach			2
i would also like to appear before you with my background as a coach			0
since i was linked to international competitions i was a hardcore defender of fair play , of the developments of values and that aspect has led me to awards and recognition by @entity3 of the merits and the organisations such as @entity161 that has declared me a champion			1
this is recognition and awards and distinctions that i will forever have close to my heart			0
train on : @entity13 captain @entity167 at training on friday ahead of their last - 16 clash with @entity124 passionate : @entity0 speaks to an assistant coach as @entity13 prepare for saturday 's match without @entity1 time to shine : primary goal - scoring responsibilities fall to @entity175 ( left ) in the absence of @entity1 moving forward : another attacking option , 35 - year - old @entity178 ( left ) trains in @entity180 on a high : midfielder @entity182 shows off some moves at the @entity185 stadium not all doom and gloom : @entity0 laughs while talking on the phone on the training ground ‘ when an inquiry is established because of fault or omission caused by a football player seen or not seen and therefore not sanctioned and you resort to videos to establish what happened			1
‘ at the match we had not seen the images			0
but because of the inquiry that was opened and we saw the images we saw that there was a possibility that punishment of the participants , @entity10 and @entity1 , that both would be punished			1
‘ i can not deny that we were waiting for the referee to caution or the corresponding disciplinary sanction			0
‘ we never thought that we were told that the details of the @entity3 decision reached of an excessive severity			1
‘ any decision which obviously is much more focused on the opinions of the media , the media that attacked immediately after the match			2
and in the press conference , journalists that only took the only topic			1
‘ and , i do n’t know what their nationality was , but they all spoke @entity9			2
just like we are close to the media pressure we were quite away from the objective date from the match			0
walk out : after delivering a 13 - minute tirade , @entity0 left the press conference answering no questions hometown hero : a boy speaks to local media as he shows support for @entity1 with his family ' @entity236			1
idol of all @entity21 ' : a sign held up by one of the hundreds who gathered outside @entity1 's mother 's home on the outskirts of the nation 's capital ‘ when i speak with media attacks , the topic that they concentrated on was above all the history of @entity236 and the things that have happened in the past			1
‘ we know of the sanctions , in spite of these harassment we know where the power lies			0
i will not discuss that			0
' that does n’t mean we should accept it and the indiscriminate use of that power , the disciplinary committee , which is there to impart justice			0
’ @entity0 intends to resign from @entity3 after their @entity123 clash with @entity124 following the decision to suspend @entity1			1
he has the complete support of his players over his decision to suspend @entity1 and he refused to take a single question			2
@entity0 added : ‘ many years ago , i started being linked to @entity3 as attache and the technical study group at @entity273 and youth tournaments and other events			1
‘ i had a position and i must leave that position			0
it is not wise or prudent to be in an organisation with people who exerted pressure , those who rendered the award , who managed criteria and values that are different to the ones i have			0
therefore in the coming days i will file my resignation to that position because of these reasons			0
