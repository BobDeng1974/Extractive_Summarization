by @entity0 for @entity1 allergy - free nuts could be coming to supermarkets within a few years after scientists found a way to modify the proteins that cause allergic reactions			1
researchers are putting the finishing touches to a new method to develop safe cashews and say that other allergy - free nuts are could be developed too			1
proteins in nuts trigger a response in allergy sufferers that ranges from mild itching in the mouth or skin , to life - threatening anaphylaxis , which leaves them struggling to breathe			1
scientists are developing a new method to create safe cashews and say that other allergy - free nuts are could be in the pipeline			1
they are changing the shape of proteins found in tree nuts and peanuts that trigger an immune response in people who are allergic to them around one in 100,000 people have severe reactions to nuts in @entity38 and peanuts are the most common cause of fatal allergic reactions to food			2
the standard advice for people with nut allergies is to avoid the food all together , but this new method could put nuts back on the menu and mean that allergy sufferers wo n't have to check food labels any more			2
speaking at the @entity51 of the @entity52 ( @entity52 ) in @entity53 , dr @entity50 said : ‘ clinical trials to test immunotherapy are underway , but we 're approaching it from an agricultural perspective rather than medical			0
‘ can we change the food , instead of treating the person , so we can eliminate or reduce severe reactions ? ’ his team is looking at ways to modify proteins in tree nuts and peanuts that trigger an immune response in people who are allergic to them			0
proteins in nuts trigger a response in allergy sufferers that range from itching to life - threatening anaphylaxis which requires an @entity71 ( pictured ) the response is launched by antibodies called @entity74 ( @entity74 ) , which recognise and latch onto the proteins			1
dr @entity50 , a researcher with the @entity77 of the @entity79 @entity78 in @entity80 , said that changing the shape of the proteins makes it harder for @entity74 to find them			1
while past research in this area has used harsh chemicals , dr @entity50 sought to achieve results using compounds that are generally regarded as safe ( @entity90 )			0
these substances are accepted by the @entity92 for use in food and pharmaceuticals			0
‘ we found that the @entity90 compound sodium sulphite can effectively disrupt the structure of a couple of the cashew allergens , ’ dr @entity50 said ‘ and we 've done a couple of different tests to show we reduced @entity74 binding to the proteins when they 've been treated with sodium sulphite			1
’ the team of scientists plan to conduct experiments on whole nuts and test the modified proteins on cells in the lab to see how they respond			0
they are also looking at enzymes - molecules that can cut up proteins - as candidates to disrupt the allergens			0
while the researchers ’ work so far focuses on cashew proteins , dr @entity50 is hopeful that the allergenic proteins , @entity90 compound and enzymes could be applied to make other nuts safer to allergy sufferers			1
‘ one of our goals is to apply our knowledge from the cashew experiments to other tree nuts and to peanuts , ’ he said			0
