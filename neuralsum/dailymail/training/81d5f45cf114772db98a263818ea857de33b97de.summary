the @entity0 handed a victory to religious conservatives this morning , ruling in favor of @entity6 craft store @entity4 in its lawsuit against the federal government			1
in a narrow 5 - 4 ruling the court said ' closely held ' businesses with religious ties like @entity4 are eligible for exemption from a provision in @entity14 that requires private businesses to provide their employees with health care plans that cover contraception			1
a ' closely held ' corporation is one in which more than 50 percent of the company 's shares is owned by five or fewer people			1
@entity4 and aligned groups argued that providing some forms of contraception like the morning after pill were tantamount to abortion , which goes against the company 's religious beliefs , because life begins at conception			1
the court held today that for - profit businesses are afforded the same religious protections as persons under the @entity40			2
' today ’s decision is an enormous victory for personal freedom in @entity62 , ' said @entity63 , a lawyer at the @entity64 , the organization that represented @entity4			2
' this decision confirms that people of conscience are welcome in business and that all @entity62 have the right to follow their moral and social convictions in every walk of life , ' he said			0
@entity74 college student @entity73 , center , cries tears of joy upon finding out that the @entity0 ruled 5 - 4 that requiring family - owned corporations to pay for insurance coverage for contraception is a violation of federal law @entity84 lawmakers and conservative institutions rushed to issue their own statements after the ruling celebrating the court 's affirmation of religious liberty and its ruling against the @entity93 administration and its allies			1
' @entity62 of faith and conscience have been vindicated and this will be a galvanizing moment for the vast majority of citizens who vehemently objected to this mandate and the elected leaders who thrust it upon us , ' @entity96 president @entity95 said			0
' today ’s @entity0 decision makes clear that the @entity93 administration can not trample on the religious freedoms that @entity62 hold dear , ' said @entity112 minority leader @entity111 , a lawmaker who voted in favor of the @entity40 two decades ago and filed a friend - of - the court brief in favor of @entity4			1
@entity117 added that , ' @entity14 is the single worst piece of legislation to pass in the last 50 years			0
' senator @entity120 , a former solicitor general for @entity121 who argued in front of the high court multiple times before being elected to federal office , said in a statement , ' this ruling is a repudiation of the @entity128 ’s untenable position that people with sincerely held religious beliefs should be forced to comply with an unconstitutional mandate while a parade of waivers , exemptions , and delays are granted for purely commercial and political interests			1
' ' the fact that @entity62 had to bring this case in the first place reveals once again just how intrusive @entity14 is			0
it 's a misguided one - size - fits - all policy that not only failed to fix our healthcare system but has trampled on our constitutional rights , ' @entity141 chairman @entity140 said in a statement			0
@entity149 communications director , @entity148 , right , high fives another pro-life demonstrator outside the @entity0 after learning that @entity4 won its case against the government the high - profile ruling is a defeat for democrats in @entity157 and progressive activists who have fought tooth and nail to protect provisions of the president 's signature law that pertain to women 's health			1
' make no mistake : today , once again , the @entity0 ruled against @entity62 women , @entity167 , a pro-choice organization that provides women 's health services , defiantly said on @entity170			1
' we ’re not going to let a handful of extreme bosses & politicians turn back the clock			0
forward , not backward , ' read another one of the organization 's tweets			0
' it 's unacceptable that in 2014 we are still fighting over women 's access to birth control , ' said @entity182 sen. @entity181 , one of 20 women serving in the upper chamber			2
@entity185 , a leading pro-choice organization , criticized the 5 - 4 ruling as sexist			0
' today 's decision from five male justices is a direct attack on women and our fundamental rights			2
this ruling goes out of its way to declare that discrimination against women is n't discrimination , ' the group said in a statement			0
the court 's three women justices , @entity201 , @entity202 , and @entity203 , made up the majority of the court 's dissenting side			0
all three women were nominated by @entity209 presidents			0
pro-choice activists , including the ones pictured here from the progressive group @entity213 , were on the scene as well in addressing the @entity0 's decision today , @entity217 press secretary @entity216 told reporters , ' today 's decision jeopardizes the health of women who are employed by these companies			1
' during his daily briefing @entity216 said the president believes in religious liberty and that is why he and his administration have taken steps to provide religiously affiliated non-profits with exemptions from the contraception mandate			1
however the president does not believe that private businesses ought to be able to ' assert their personal religious views to deny their employees federally mandated benefits , ' @entity216 said			0
it is ' too early to say ' what kind of steps that the president could take even take if he wanted to push back on the high court 's decision , @entity216 told reporters , but the president has said he will work with @entity157 to make sure the women affected by today 's decision are covered			2
asked if he agreed with @entity84 who say the decision was ' a devastating blow ' to @entity14 , @entity216 said the decision applied to a ' specific ' set of businesses and women and the rest of the law remains intact			2
what would have been a devastating blow , @entity216 said , was if the @entity0 had ruled two years ago that @entity14 violated the @entity256 by requiring @entity62 to purchase health insurance			1
@entity14 supporters hold up signs outside the @entity0 with pictures of fictional male bosses , including @entity263 's @entity262 and @entity265 's @entity264 , that say ' this guy should n't get to decide about my birth control ' senate majority leader @entity269 , a chief proponent of @entity14 , slammed the court 's decision as one that ' jeopardizes women ’s access to essential health care ' and vowed to ' continue to fight to preserve women ’s access to contraceptive coverage and keep bosses out of the examination room			1
' ' the bottom line is that today ’s decision is wrong for women			2
your boss should never be able to make your health care decisions for you , ' @entity269 said			0
' a woman 's personal health decisions about choosing to use contraception and when to start a family should stay strictly between her and her doctor — not her boss , ' @entity286 sen. @entity285 , a @entity287 facing a stiff reelection battle this fall , said			0
' the @entity62 @entity0 's decision unacceptably takes these choices out of doctors ' offices and into the workplace , ' he continued			2
protestors with @entity185 demonstrate in favor of the contraception mandate outside of the @entity0 @entity302 co-chairs @entity303 of @entity182 and @entity304 of @entity286 said in a statement blasting the decision that the @entity0 ' has awarded another one of our precious constitutional rights – the right to free exercise of religion – to for - profit corporations			1
' ' despite the @entity0 ’s attempt to single out women ’s health care in today ’s opinion , it leaves the door open to employers being able to deny coverage of other essential health services such as a child ’s vaccine or a life - saving blood transfusion based on religious beliefs , ' they said			1
the women also noted that the ruling would allow businesses to challenge other federal laws on religious grounds			0
in the majority opinion the @entity0 stated that its ruling would not allow businesses to use the religious exemption to discriminate against employees on the basis of race because ' the government has a compelling interest in providing equal opportunity to participate in the workforce without regard to race , and prohibitions on racial discrimination are precisely tailored to achieve that critical goal			1
' it did not specifically address other types of workplace discrimination such as sexual orientation - something liberals are trying to ban via the @entity350			0
@entity93 has reportedly said he will issue an executive order prohibiting the workplace practice if @entity157 does not bring the legislation for a vote .			0

@entity6 craft store @entity4 sued the government over @entity14 's contraception mandate
today the @entity0 ruled that @entity4 and other ' closely held ' businesses could apply for exemption from the mandate based on their religious beliefs
*republicans* are celebrating the decision as a victory for religious liberty , and democrats are slamming it as a setback for women 's health
