@entity0 : there is growing evidence that several cardinals do not want @entity4 to live in an apartment block inside the walls of the @entity7 the @entity8 is under pressure to go into exile from @entity11 after he retires so that he does not interfere with the work of his successor , senior @entity15 sources indicated yesterday			1
there is growing evidence that several cardinals are anxious that @entity4 should not carry through his plan to live in an apartment block inside the walls of the @entity7			1
they fear the close presence of a retired @entity8 will create difficulties for the new man who will take over the @entity24 this spring			1
the suggestion that @entity4 should be effectively evicted from his planned retreat and dismissed from @entity11 came just two days after the @entity8 ’s sudden announcement of his resignation threw the church ’s leadership into turmoil			1
the @entity7 has been gripped with rumours of faction fighting while potential candidates for the succession have been jostling for position for when 117 cardinals meet to elect a successor next month			1
there has been confusion over the future status of @entity4 , with conflicting statements on what name he will take after retirement and hints from his brother that he will not go into silent retreat but may make himself available to advise the newly - appointed @entity8			1
according to reports , influential figures have indicated to @entity4 that it may be unwise to live in an apartment block within the @entity7 walls			1
the four - storey block , built in 1992 , has been used to accommodate orders of nuns , but is currently being refurbished as a retirement home for the @entity8 and a small entourage of assistants and servants			1
however if @entity4 moves in after his retirement takes effect on 28 february he may find his presence unpopular and sentiment among the cardinals leaning in favour of what could amount to an eviction			2
according to the influential @entity70 newspaper @entity69 , those who believe @entity4 should think again include archbishop @entity71			0
@entity71 was appointed by @entity4 in 2010 to head his newly - created @entity72 , which is charged with reinforcing the faith in old catholic countries			0
according to the paper , the archbishop thinks that 85 - year - old @entity4 should find somewhere outside the @entity77 to live			0
the @entity7 has been gripped with rumours of faction fighting while potential candidates for the succession have been jostling for position it said : ‘ the continuing presence of both the old and the new @entity8 raises such embarrassment for the @entity7 that those like archbishop @entity71 do not rule out that the @entity8 ’s final home will eventually be found outside the hallowed halls			1
’ the pressure on @entity4 to go into exile was also reported in the respected @entity90 journal @entity91 , by its widely - read @entity77 commentator , @entity92			0
‘ there are already hints of a more critical tone , ’ he said			0
‘ on background , one @entity7 prelate said today that some cardinals are concerned about @entity4 ’s decision to live on @entity77 grounds after his retirement , fearing it might cast a shadow over the new pope			2
‘ perhaps it would be better , he said , for @entity4 to find a monastery in @entity106 to call home			0
’ since the resignation announcement on monday there has been deepening concern that @entity4 ’s presence will mean the church has , in effect , one too many @entity8			1
no @entity8 has resigned in nearly 600 years			2
the last one to do so willingly , @entity117 , who resigned in 1294 , was flung into prison by the next , @entity116 , in order to prevent any possible rivalry			0
the last @entity8 to resign willingly was @entity117 , who resigned in 1294 , and was flung into prison @entity117 – @entity4 visited his tomb and praised his actions in 2009 – died in his cell two years after abandoning the @entity24			2
among difficulties that have surfaced is the problem of what to call @entity4			0
different church authorities have made conflicting statements that he will keep his papal name and the title ‘ your holiness ’ , and that he will drop the name @entity4 and return to being cardinal @entity4			0
a further embarrassment surfaced when , following a phone conversation with the @entity8 , his brother @entity134 said @entity4 would make himself available to advise his successor if required			2
@entity7 officials have since repeatedly insisted that @entity4 will have nothing to do with the appointment of his successor or the conduct of @entity8 business after he retires			1
rumours in @entity11 yesterday were also pointing to enmity between two leading @entity77 figures likely to be influential when the conclave , the gathering of cardinals that will choose the next @entity8 late in march , assembles			1
cardinal @entity148 , @entity149 , will organise the conclave			0
however , his efforts to sway decisions , it was said , are likely to be frustrated by @entity154 , who in 2006 took over from @entity148 as secretary of state , the @entity8 ’s chief political representative			2
@entity148 is said to be furious that @entity154 has neglected the careers of officials he once promoted			0
however , no cardinal over the age of 80 may take part in the conclave			0
since @entity148 is 85 and @entity154 78 , @entity154 will be inside the conclave and in the best position to influence voting .			0
