in 2018 , @entity0 will launch the @entity2 spacecraft using the largest , most powerful rocket booster ever built ; the @entity4 ( @entity4 )			1
tucked inside the stage adapter - the ring connecting @entity2 to the top propulsion stage of the @entity4 - will be 11 self - contained small satellites , each about the size of a large shoebox			1
now , the space agency has revealed three missions that will use these small satellites during the test flight to help develop technologies for astronauts travelling to deep space			1
a concept image of the @entity21 mission , one of 11 missions that will be secondary payloads to the first test flight of @entity0 's @entity4 ' @entity0 is taking advantage of a great opportunity to conduct more science beyond our primary focus of this mission , ' said @entity33 manager of @entity0 's @entity34			2
' while this new vehicle will enable missions beyond @entity38 orbit , we 're taking steps to increase the scientific and exploration capability of @entity4 by accommodating small , cubesat - class payloads			2
' the first is a @entity21 ( @entity21 ) scout , using solar sail propulsion , will fly by a small asteroid , taking pictures and making observations			1
it aims to improve the current understanding of the asteroid environment and yield key information for future astronauts exploring an asteroid			0
@entity52 will use yeast to detect , measure , and compare the impact of deep space radiation on living organisms over long durations beyond @entity59 near - @entity21 ( @entity21 ) scout , using solar sail propulsion , will fly by a small asteroid , taking pictures and making observations			1
it aims to improve the current understanding of the asteroid environment and yield key information for future astronauts exploring an asteroid			0
@entity66 will scout for locations on the lunar surface that are rich in resources that , once broken down into their component molecules , could be used in future exploration			0
the hope is future astronauts can use the technology to produce building materials , propellant , oxygen and water			0
@entity52 will use yeast to detect , measure , and compare the impact of deep space radiation on living organisms over long durations beyond @entity59			1
this will help scientists understand the effects of the deep space environment on biological systems as we plan to send humans farther into space than ever before			2
' a solar sail works best when deployed in deep space and @entity4 will get us there , ' said @entity95 , principal investigator for @entity96 at @entity97			1
' it will take us out of @entity38 orbit and to interplanetary space - where we need to be to deploy the solar sail			0
it 's a perfect ride to begin our mission			0
' @entity0 's @entity66 will scout for locations on the lunar surface that are rich in resources that , once broken down into their component molecules , could be used in future exploration			2
the hope is future astronauts can use the technology to produce building materials , propellant , oxygen and water			0
@entity66 will use a large solar sail , similar to the @entity96 sail , to reflect sunlight and illuminate the moon 's permanently shadowed craters and then the science instruments will measure the surface water ice			1
meanwhile , @entity52 will use yeast to detect , measure , and compare the impact of deep space radiation on living organisms over long durations beyond @entity59			1
this will help scientists understand the effects of the deep space environment on biological systems as we plan to send humans farther into space than ever before			2
the @entity52 mission will be the first time living organisms have travelled to deep space in over 40 years and the spacecraft will operate in the deep space radiation environment throughout its 18 - month mission			1
the experiments will be launched by @entity144 - based @entity0 in 2018 during a test flight of the @entity2 spacecraft using the largest , most powerful rocket booster ever built ; the @entity4 the missions are a key part of the historic test flight , dubbed @entity151			1
about 10 minutes after @entity2 and its service module escape the pull of @entity38 's gravity , the two will disconnect and @entity2 will proceed toward the moon			2
once @entity2 is a safe distance away , the small payloads will begin to be deployed , all at various times during the flight depending on the particular missions			0
these cubesats are small nano - satellites designed to be efficient and versatile			0
the masses of these secondary payloads are light - no heavier than 30lb ( 14kg )			0
they will essentially piggyback on the @entity4 flight , providing what otherwise would be costly access to deep space			1
' we are expanding the capabilities of this particular @entity4 test flight , ' said @entity175 , deputy manager of the @entity176 at @entity97			0
' the rocket will be the strongest ever built by @entity0 and we want to take advantage of that design			0
' flying secondary payloads is something we plan to do for missions to come and provide the science community an opportunity they have n't had before			0
' they will essentially piggyback on the @entity4 flight , providing what otherwise would be costly access to deep space			1

they will be *included* in 2018 flight of @entity2 and @entity4
@entity96 will fly by a small asteroid , taking pictures and getting data
@entity66 will illuminate moon 's craters and measure surface ice
@entity52 will use yeast to measure the impact of deep space radiation
