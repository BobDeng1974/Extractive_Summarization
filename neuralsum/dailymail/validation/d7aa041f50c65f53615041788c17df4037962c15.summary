this pair of cute husky puppies may look sweet as they cuddle up to groups of soldiers , but these images help prove an open secret @entity7 's president does not want the world to know			2
the shots were posted on social media by @entity7 troops from military unit 46108 , the 5th @entity12 , based in @entity13 , which lies between @entity14 and @entity15 in the far east of @entity16			1
a keen - eyed blogger has used them to help prove these soldiers have been fighting and dying very far away from there in eastern @entity22 - something @entity23 has always denied			1
they back up the account of a 20 - year - old tankist who claims he was hurt fighting in a civil war which has torn @entity22 apart , according to blogger @entity29			1
a @entity7 soldier in the 5th @entity12 with two @entity32 huskies , apparently at the @entity34 military base near the @entity22 border			1
this helps bolster claims of direct @entity7 involvement in the civil war the dogs all have exactly the same markings , helping to provide a common thread between all the images the brigade 's stay at the base over the winter was likely in preparation for crossing the @entity22 border and joining the fight on the separatist rebel side this is because the shots of the @entity32 huskies , unmistakably the same ones given the identical patterns on their fur , provide a common thread linking images which all purport to show the brigade members at the @entity61 military base in @entity7 near the @entity22 border			1
on march 2 the tankist in question , @entity64 , gave an explosive interview to @entity7 independent newspaper @entity66 in which he claimed to have sustained injuries fighting against government forces in @entity22			2
his brigade 's stay at @entity72 over the winter , in preparation for crossing the border and joining the fight on the separatist rebel side , was a key part of the young soldier 's account			0
in the background of the photographs with the dogs various elements of the camp - including tents , military equipment and trenches - are visible , helping to confirm its existence and the specific military units stationed there			0
the photographs themselves are also geotagged as being taken at the base which , along with the common thread of the two huskies and satellite imagery showing military hardware stationed in the area , makes it safe to say that members of the 5th @entity12 , and other @entity7 tank brigades , were stationed at the @entity72 base			1
in the background of the photographs various elements of the camp - including tents , military equipment and trenches - are visible , helping to confirm its existence and the specific military units stationed there a number of images of @entity7 tanks with their marking obscured were posted on social network @entity113 a @entity7 tank with the identification number on its hull covered over can be seen in the background here the ploy was most likely done to make it harder to identify the tanks as @entity7 when they rolled into @entity22 according to @entity29 all of this gives credibility to @entity64 's more revealing claims that he was hurt on february 19 when being fired upon by @entity22 soldiers in the deadly ' @entity127 pocket ' near the strategic transport hub seized by rebel forces			1
a despatch from separatist fighters on february 19 describes how the road between @entity133 in the area of @entity135 became a ' road of death ' for @entity22 soldiers - though @entity7 fighter @entity64 escaped with his life			2
this satellite shot shows a build up of military vehicles around the @entity72 base he is apparently far from home recovering from serious injuries in @entity146 near the @entity22 border after being transferred from a burn recovery unit in a @entity149			0
the photographs of tanks on the @entity72 training ground show numerous examples of the identification numbers on their hulls being obscured - exactly the kind of ploy which would make them harder to identify as @entity7 when they most likely rolled into @entity22			0
@entity29 writes : ' @entity160 locations on @entity113 [ a @entity7 social network ] are often unreliable , but there is a common thread that links many soldiers together to confirm that they were at the same place at roughly the same time : two @entity32 husky puppies			1
' it is quite rare to have a common identifying feature that is unique to a specific date and time when conducting geolocation , but this is such a case			0
' and yes , much like some camouflage patterns on uniforms and tanks , the fur patterns of the puppies match perfectly in each photograph			0
' ' the cumulative effect of all of these details is hard to dispute			0
members of the 5th @entity12 were indisputably at the @entity61 training ground throughout the winter , starting in november , but it is difficult to determine how many of the 5th @entity12 fought in @entity22			2
' regardless , one of these tankists was in a burn unit in @entity22 from battlefield injuries , and nearly all of the verifiable details provided in his interview can be confirmed through open source data			0
' it would have taken either an inconceivably talented conspirator or a cosmic coincidence for this interview not to be considered key evidence of @entity7 military involvement in @entity22 after the adoption of the february 15 @entity201 ceasefire accords			0

back up the account of tankist who claims he was hurt in @entity22 civil war
@entity64 claimed to have suffered burns near @entity127
husky shots place soldiers at military base on @entity22 border over winter
provide common thread linking images , according to keen - eyed blogger
