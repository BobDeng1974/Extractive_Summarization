@entity12 , 76 , is currently paying £ 3,543 a month out of her savings to live at a care home in @entity15 in @entity16			1
but her fees are now being increased to £ 10,355 per month , of which the government contributes just £ 432			2
the home , run by the @entity21 , says mrs @entity12 ’ fees have increased because of her complex and challenging needs			1
she has been given until july to decide whether to pay the increased fees - or move out			1
her daughter @entity3 , 44 , said her mother will now have to sell her home in @entity4 to meet the astronomical costs			2
mrs @entity3 , a housewife , is calling on the government put a cap on fees at care homes , which are currently free to charge what they like			2
she said : ' it seems as when you are a privately funded patient , care homes can charge what they like			0
' there seems to be no regulatory body controlling the fees or putting a cap on them			0
' these fees are extortionate - you could enjoy an all - year luxury cruise or pay three live - in carers a week for the same money			2
' mrs @entity12 suffers from lymphedema , a condition that causes swelling in the body ’s tissue , and can not walk			1
she moved into @entity7 in december as she requires a specialist track hoist to move her around			0
but her daughter says she is still able to carry out everyday tasks herself such as eating and drinking			0
mrs @entity3 added : ' @entity57 ’s only problem is with her lymphedema which causes swollen legs and makes it impossible for her to walk			0
' she is articulate and can feed herself , brush her hair and give herself a drink			0
i think it is outrageous that the fees have risen so much as mum ’s needs have not changed			0
' @entity15 retirement village is charging a 76 - year - old resident £ 125,000 a year in fees mrs @entity3 , who lives in @entity71 , @entity16 , applied to the government for @entity73 for help in paying the fees			1
but the application was refused - as mrs @entity12 ’ has savings of more than £ 23,000 and therefore does not qualify for help			1
mrs @entity3 has now written to @entity16 mp dr @entity78 and health secretary @entity79 asking for support , as well as appealing to the @entity21			0
a spokeswoman for @entity21 said the price increase will only cover the actual cost @entity83 ’ care - which is 91 additional staff hours every week , costing £ 1,365			1
she said : ' the trust has been very concerned to provide a long - term care solution for mrs @entity12 , despite her extremely complex care needs which has arisen as a consequence of various health conditions , weight and lack of mobility			1
' the care requirements for mrs @entity12 are considerably greater than for all other residents			1
' she currently receives an additional 13 hours of dedicated care every day			1
' the trust has been providing this additional care , without question , and at its own cost since early december , but we hope people understand that , as a not - for - profit organisation , we can not continue to do this on an indefinite basis			1
' but a spokesman for the @entity108 said the cost was “ astronomical ”			0
he said : ' these are astronomical fees			0
the care home usually charges around £ 1,000 each week - so this is more than double the average cost			1
' there is no cap on fees , no minimum or maximum that care homes have to adhere to			2
they can charge what they like and what they think they can get away with			0
' it is worse than a postcode lottery , it is a home by home lottery with each charging something different			0
' it is pretty despicable and an areas that desperately needs to be controlled			0
in a way it is exploiting an individual who simply can not afford to sustain such a high cost			0
' if she can not pay , she will be forced to move out and find other care , something that places a great deal of stress and strain on a person			2

mrs @entity12 , 76 , has until july to decide whether to pay the increased fees - or move out
care home says mrs @entity12 receives 13 hours extra additional care compared to other residents
