by @entity0 last updated at 6:06 pm on 1st december 2011 a second @entity1 has exploded without warning just days after another device blew up on a flight sparking fears over the safety of the phone			1
reports from @entity8 say that the @entity1 was plugged in to charge overnight when it began to emit smoke and sparks as its owner slept nearby			1
this is the second high - profile explosion of an @entity1 in a week , in the first incident the handheld device spontaneously combusted during landing on a flight in @entity17 two days ago			1
battery issues : customers have had problems with @entity1 batteries in the past - but this is the second explosion incident in two days tech and mobile website @entity23 , which reported the incident , said : ' looks like @entity17 is n’t the only country to have seen an incident of a combustible @entity1 over the past week			1
' according to @entity8 media reports , the @entity1 ’s owner emerged unscathed but flustered			1
' in the first incident , an @entity30 began ‘ emitting a significant amount of dense smoke , accompanied by a red glow ’ , said @entity17 's @entity35 airline			1
the fire was put out by a flight attendant and the device , thought to be an @entity1 , given to air traffic safety investigators for checks			1
no passengers or crew were harmed			0
a picture released by the airline , @entity17 ’s largest independent regional carrier , shows the rear casing shattered in parts and scorched in others			2
@entity49 @entity17 says it is ‘ looking forward to working with officials ’			2
@entity51 : an @entity1 began smoking after landing in @entity52 , @entity17			1
the fire was extinguished by a flight attendant the cause has yet to be identified but experts say that it may be due to the phone ’s battery overheating or to the device being a counterfeit model			1
earlier this month , @entity49 recalled first generation @entity62 mp3 players over concerns about defective batteries overheating			0
however , these devices were made in 2005 and 2006 and so are much older than the exploding @entity1 mobiles			2
the drama began when the crew smelt smoke in the cabin as a flight from @entity72 in @entity73 landed in @entity52 on friday evening			0
in a statement headed ‘ mobile phone self - combustion ’ , @entity35 said : ‘ in accordance with company standard safety procedures , the flight attendant carried out recovery action immediately and the red glow was extinguished successfully			1
‘ all passengers and crew onboard were unharmed			0
’ it added that it has reported the incident to the @entity86 ( @entity86 ) and the @entity87 ( @entity87 )			0
the @entity86 , which has listed the incident as involving ‘ smokes , fumes and fire ’ will strip down the phone to ‘ try and understand what happened ’			0
a @entity87 spokesman said that he had never heard of a similar incident occurring during or after a flight			0
mobile phone experts said it is possible the fire was caused by the phone ’s battery overheating			2
rechargeable lithium ion batteries are widely used in mobile phones and laptops and , when shipped in large numbers , have been linked to fires on planes in the past			0
last year , the @entity108 in the @entity109 issued a safety alert after a cargo plane carrying a large shipment of the batteries went on fire and crashed near @entity115 , killing both pilots			2
it read : ‘ overheating has the potential to create thermal runaway , a chain reaction leading to self - heating and release of a battery ’s stored energy			0
flames on a plane : the phone ignited on @entity35 ‘ in a fire situation , the air temperature in a cargo compartment fire may be above the auto - ignition temperature of lithium			0
‘ for this reason , batteries that are not involved in an initial fire may ignite and propagate , thus creating a risk of a catastrophic event			0
‘ the existence and magnitude of the risk will depend on such factors as the total number and type of batteries on board an aircraft , the batteries ’ proximity to one another , and existing risk mitigation measures in place			0
’ there are also suggestions that the phone – or battery – may have been fake			2
@entity156 , of @entity157 @entity158 , said : ‘ this is a very rare thing and so it makes you suspect it might be a counterfeit battery			2
‘ when you think about the number of people who have iphones and other smartphones , it does n’t really happen			0
’ @entity168 , of the @entity17 @entity169 , told @entity170 : ‘ we urge people to be very careful if they are buying batteries that they buy them from a reputable dealer , look for products that are identified by the manufacturer of your phone as compatible and be very aware of cheap imitations			1
’ many @entity1 users have already complained that their battery drains faster than expected .			1

@entity183 had a *meltdown* onboard @entity17 flight
*failure* raises further questions over safety of @entity1 batteries
suggestion that fault could be due to counterfeit phone or battery
