her mother said in a statement read to the inquest in @entity35 : ' this has come totally out of the blue , she was a happy , outgoing girl , she had been happy all that week and she was looking forward to going to @entity38 for the summer holidays			1
' she had a boyfriend and they had a good relationship			0
she did not have any issues and was happy at school she had lots of friends			0
she had been bullied at school years before but had got over that and had blossomed and had not been bullied since			0
' she had never attempted to take her life before			0
we ca n't understand , we think it was an accident which went wrong			0
we ca n't believe it was intentional , there are no issues over the circumstances of her death			0
' she added : ' @entity1 had an argument with her brother , they had argued about the use of our computer			2
@entity1 was told to go to bed , it would have been around 9 pm			2
' at around 9.15 pm @entity2 also went upstairs to bed and he discovered @entity1			1
' he raised the alarm and got her down and i commenced cpr and an ambulance was called - but sadly @entity1 had died			2
' detective inspector @entity71 said that efforts were being made to revive the schoolgirl when he arrived			2
he said : ' the conclusion i reached is that she positioned herself so that whoever was next upstairs behind her would have seen her and would be shocked into responding			0
' with exactly how she intended to present herself the intention was to shock her brother or whoever was going up the stairs following the minor incident with her brother			0
' tributes : @entity1 was described as ' an extremely popular girl ' with a ' lively outgoing character ' by her headteacher death : @entity1 was found hanged in the family home in @entity4 , @entity5			1
despite her mother 's efforts to revive her she was pronounced dead at the scene recording a verdict of accidental death @entity35 coroner @entity91 said : ' i could not possibly say that this young lady intended to take her own life			1
' the situation is that @entity1 has gone upstairs after a minor row , she has been absent from the family for a very short time , nothing has been heard			1
' she has placed herself in a situation - where allowing for the fact that there were more private locations , she must have known she could be easily found indicating to me that was her intention			0
' she was displaying herself , she had put herself on display to demonstrate upset or an annoyance in the hope that she would be found			0
it seems to me that @entity1 probably intended a demonstration that has tragically gone wrong			2
