by @entity0 published : 05:54 est , 9 august 2013 updated : 07:10 est , 9 august 2013 if beleaguered @entity2 fails in his bid to win @entity5 's upcoming mayoral election , it turns out he at least has a fallback option ... as a @entity8 television presenter			1
but when that day finally comes , whatever you do , just do n't ask him to do the weather			0
in his latest cringe - worthy performance in front of the cameras , the former @entity12 attempted to deflect a tough question from an @entity18 reporter in @entity5 yesterday by answering in a bizarre fake - @entity8 accent			1
and if witnesses thought it could n't get any worse , he then tried to melt the joke 's frosty reception by attempting to perform an @entity18 weather forecast			1
' am i in a @entity28 sketch ? ' @entity2 appeared to mock @entity8 television reporter @entity29 when she asked him if anything would stop him after a campaign event odd behaviour : deploying a bizarre fake - @entity8 accent , @entity2 told @entity35 's @entity34 , ' i just have a feeling i 've like stepped into a @entity28 bit ... ' i do n't know would anything stop me ? ' now is a rock going to fall on my head ? ' the achingly awkward episode began when @entity34 's @entity29 asked him after a campaign event if anything would stop him in his bid to be the city 's new mayor			1
@entity47 , he said : ' i just have a feeling i 've like stepped into a @entity28 bit ... ' i do n't know would anything stop me ? ' now is a rock going to fall on my head ? ' and as any comedian worth his salt knows , the best way to comeback after a joke falls on its face is to swiftly tell better one			1
so he offered : ' is there anything else i can do for @entity35 ? do you want me to do the weather or something ? ' as reporter @entity29 duly obliged , he said : ' it 's going to be rainy , cloudy and grey so do what you can guys , try to keep your head up and keep a stiff upper lip			0
' he was perhaps unaware that @entity8 has , ironically , been enjoying its hottest and driest summer for almost ten years			2
not so sunny : he then did a mock report on the @entity8 weather , advising @entity73 to ' keep a stiff upper lip ' it is the latest of a string of gaffes by @entity2 , whose poll lead has evaporated following revelations that he continued to exchange sexually explicit messages online after he resigned from @entity81 in 2011			1
it comes just months after mr @entity2 resigned as a congressman amid a massive sex scandal that burst his well - known career in flames			2
the @entity5 was caught sending sexually explicit photos to a bevy of young women on @entity90			0
beleaguered : @entity2 fights off criticism as he campaigns in @entity92 , @entity5 , last month humiliation : @entity5 mayoral candidate @entity2 and his wife @entity93 attend a news conference in @entity5 last month after initially denying the authenticity of the photos , he was forced to admit that he had in fact been sending them while he was married to his wife , @entity93			2
he and ms @entity93 , a longtime personal aide to secretary of state @entity100 , were married for less than a year when the photos were discovered and the scandal tarnished his name			0
adding another layer of disgrace to the situation was the fact that ms @entity93 was pregnant with the couple 's first child - @entity107 - when the scandal broke in may of last year			0
for @entity111 : @entity93 ( left - with her husband on their wedding day in 2010 ) decided to stay in her marriage to help @entity2 and for their child @entity107 ( right ) @entity117 : @entity5 mayoral candidate @entity2 admitted to sexting 22 - year - old @entity119 's ( right ) ms @entity93 stood by her husband , however , and kept busy at work with ms @entity100 while they weathered the storm of bad publicity			1
known for his brash personality and lofty career aspirations - he was expected to run for mayor of @entity5 after @entity129 's term ends next year - mr @entity2 has been keeping an uncharacteristically low profile			2
but it is not the first gaffe he has made in front of the cameras			0
he recently raised eyebrows at a political meeting in @entity137 when he suggested that an elderly woman in the audience might be flirting with him			0
@entity2 was taking questions from attendees at a @entity142 of @entity137 meeting when he noticed a gesture from one woman			0
‘ were you raising your hand or flirting with me ? ’ @entity2 asked the woman , who had tentatively raised her hand .			1

@entity2 made joke after @entity34 asked him if anything would stop him
he replied in bad @entity8 accent : ' i feel i 've stepped into a @entity28 bit '
then tried to melt frosty reception by doing mock @entity18 weather forecast
