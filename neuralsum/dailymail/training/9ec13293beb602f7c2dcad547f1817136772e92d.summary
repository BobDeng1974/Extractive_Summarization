by @entity0 just when you thought the news could n’t get any better for @entity6 ’s @entity5 captain @entity4 , it did			2
just when you thought it could n’t get any worse for his opposite number @entity12 , it did			2
@entity4 ’s hope that @entity15 ’s struggling trio of @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 could find some form at the @entity20 was thrillingly realised on the opening day			1
@entity16 shot 65 , his lowest score in 17 appearances in the season ’s final major and one that also equalled his best in any of the @entity25 events			1
when you think how close he has come to winning so many , it speaks volumes for the quality of this performance , which even featured a double bogey			2
contrast all that cheer to place alongside the successes @entity6 golfers have enjoyed this summer with the turmoil on @entity12 ’s plate			2
as if the sagas involving @entity61 and @entity62 were not enough , @entity59 ’s highest - ranked golfer @entity58 withdrew from this event with a bad back			1
halfway through the afternoon he was joined by defending champion @entity66 , another certainty to qualify for @entity59 ’s team for @entity69 but one who is clearly struggling desperately with a bad neck			2
much more of this and @entity12 , who was a commendable level par after 14 holes , might have to pick himself			1
@entity4 had a word with @entity16 about his indifferent play over the summer and asked him to show some form			1
how does a combined total of 128 for his last two rounds sound ? ‘ i do n’t know whether he is looking for a reason to pick me but i shot 63 last sunday at @entity84 and now i am leading a major , so i think i am ticking that box for him , ’ said a buoyant @entity81			2
concentration : @entity16 chips towards the flag on the first hole not bad for his age : @entity91 impressed on his rare venture away from the senior tour twelve months ago , @entity16 blew a decent chance to finally end his well - documented major drought with a final round of 76 in this event			1
after a few beers on the way home , the frustration came pouring out in a uncharacteristically coarse @entity103 rant			2
he ’s hardly been the same player since , with yet more frustration expressed at the @entity105 last month , where he said he had lost his spark			2
since then he ’s hit the gym , lost a bit of weight and gained a little self - esteem			1
he ’s worked hard with his swing coach @entity111 and rediscovered his timing			0
he ’s finally listening to his estimable caddie @entity113 , who urged him all along to remain patient			0
‘ i think anyone who ever picked up a club knows how frustrating the game is and how much it can make you swear , ’ said @entity16			1
‘ i hate listening to @entity113 talk about patience because i ’m not a patient person but he ’s right			0
so it was nice to turn a good swing , good technique and good feelings into a good score			0
’ perfect start : @entity16 looks chuffed after his first round at @entity38 eye on the prize : @entity17 is another @entity6 who impressed on day one can he enjoy a good friday ? that ’s the next thing , of course			1
@entity17 ’s not exactly the world ’s most patient man either , and he ’s certainly been tested this year when he has gone from one injury to another			1
if it ’s not his shoulder giving him gyp it ’s his back or wrist			0
‘ when you think how strongly i finished last season it has been very demoralising and the last eight months have been atrocious , to be honest , ’ he said			0
it ’s surely not a coincidence that he finally played well in the week where he was able to put in a five - hour stretch on the practice ground without feeling like seizing up at the end of it			1
‘ i ’ve never had injuries before and never had to put up with taking two steps forward and one step back all the time , ’ he said			0
‘ but it ’s time to look forward			0
this is a good start at a time of year when there ’s an awful lot to go at			0
’ @entity4 had a quiet word with him too , and even if it is unthinkable that he wo n’t be at @entity69 , he knows he can free up a wild card with a top - five finish or so here			1
impressive : @entity16 shares the lead with @entity59 journeymen @entity162 and @entity164 great day : but @entity164 and @entity162 are n't expected to be challenging come sunday @entity16 shared the early first - round lead with @entity59 journeymen @entity162 and @entity164 , with @entity167 @entity166 and the perennial nearly man @entity169 a shot behind			1
in addition to those mentioned , @entity6 was well represented with @entity173 champion @entity172 from @entity174 on 67 , @entity176 @entity175 and @entity177 from the @entity178 on 68 and @entity180 @entity179 on 69			0
@entity15 ’s @entity181 started yet another major badly and fought back , again as usual , finishing with three straight birdies for a 70			0
@entity91 , playing his first major for four years by virtue of winning the senior @entity20 in may , shot a creditable 70			1
the star turn during the afternoon , of course , was man of the moment @entity189 , looking for his second major in four weeks and third win in a row			0
as ever , there was never a dull moment			0
after cruising to the turn in just 32 shots , a wicked hook at the 10th sailed out of bounds and he followed the resultant double bogey with another dropped shot at the 11th			0
birdies at the next two holes took him to two under , though , and back on track .			0

@entity16 hits six - over - par 65 on opening day at @entity38
early clubhouse leader with @entity162 and @entity164
@entity17 and @entity91 also impress in first round
@entity62 finishes on three - over after round of 74
