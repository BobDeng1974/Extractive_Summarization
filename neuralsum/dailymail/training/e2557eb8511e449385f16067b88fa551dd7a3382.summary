running robots have been inspired by nature ’s fastest runners , including the cheetah and the ostrich			0
but one group of researchers has looked further back in time for their inspiration and created a speedy droid based on the now extinct velociraptor , which lived between 75 and 71 million years ago			0
the robo - raptor has two powerful legs that can propel it to speeds of 28.5mph ( 46km/h ) which is just fast enough to beat @entity15 in a race			1
cool runnings : the robot ( pictured ) has a top speed of 28.6mph ( 46km/h ) and is inspired by a velociraptor the machine was created by a team of engineers at @entity25 ( @entity25 ) and has a mechanism that mimics a tail , as well as its two nimble legs , @entity21 reported			1
in one test run , the robot recorded a top speed of 28.5mph ( 46km/h ) on a treadmill , which is almost as fast as a cheetah bot – the world ’s fastest legged robot – which can run at 29mph ( 47km/h )			1
in comparison , the world ’s fastest sprinter , @entity15 , can run at 27.4mph ( 44.7km/h )			2
th chase is on : the robo - raptor has two powerful legs and has a top speed of 28.6mph ( 46km/h )			2
it was created by by a team of engineers at @entity25 ( @entity25 ) and has a mechanism that mimics a tail , as well as its two nimble legs nimble : each of the robotic raptor 's legs ( pictured ) has an @entity52 to works as a shock absorber			1
it also has a tail , which while dissimilar to the dinosaur 's , helps it keep its body more stable while it jumps over obstacles ancient : a group of researchers from @entity64 have have created a speedy robot based on a ferocious velociraptor ( pictured ) which was one of the dinosuars to terrify children in the film @entity71 while @entity75 ’ cheetah is heavy , four - legged and powered by hydraulics , the robotic velociraptor weighs just under 7lbs ( 3kg ) and has two legs made of carbon fibre			1
each of the legs has an @entity52 to works as a shock absorber			0
the @entity80 has a tail , which while dissimilar to the dinosaur ’s , helps it keep its body more stable while it jumps over obstacles , @entity84 , a phd student at @entity25 , @entity64 said			2
this capability was tested by the researchers throwing obstacles onto the treadmill for the robot to negotiate			0
the tail swings from side to side as the robot runs to act as a counterweight and stop the robot plunging forwards and backwards , @entity90 reported			0
but both sprinting bots rely on poles to stop them falling over , giving @entity15 a large advantage is a race was ever run between man and robot			0
fast : the robo - raptor has two powerful legs that can propel it to speeds of 28.6mph ( 46km/h ) which is just fast enough to beat @entity15 ( pictured ) in a race , whose top speed is 27.4mph ( 44.7km/h ) @entity114 kitty : in one test run , the robot recorded a top speed of 28.5mph ( 46km/h ) on a treadmill , which is almost as fast as a cheetah bot ( pictured ) - the world 's fastest legged robot - which can run at 29mph ( 47km/h )			1

the robotic dinosaur 's top speed is 28.5mph ( 46km/h )
it was built by engineers at @entity25 in @entity129 and has two nimble legs and a tail for balance
it 's not quite as fast as @entity136 ' record - breaking cheetah bot but could *theoretically* out - run *olympian* @entity15
