embattled manager @entity0 led @entity1 to their first point in a 0 - 0 draw with high - flying @entity4 , which came at the end of a week of high drama at @entity7			1
it seemed improbable that @entity9 would even be in charge of this contest after the @entity12 spoke to @entity14 's @entity13 about his post earlier this week , while chairman @entity16 had also openly called his current manager 's professionalism into question			1
but @entity0 , who has retained the backing of @entity1 supporters despite six successive losses , was in the dugout to see a spirited performance which suggests this team are not as doomed as their early - season form indicates			2
@entity1 manager @entity0 ( right ) smiles after his side 's first point of the season against @entity4 @entity1 forward @entity30 ( left ) is challenged by @entity4 ' @entity31 whether he is around to preside over that potential turnaround remains to be seen , though , given @entity33 is seemingly intent on parting ways with a boss he hired less than 100 days ago			1
@entity4 could have gone top of the @entity38 with a victory and hit the woodwork through @entity41 before half - time , while @entity12 striker @entity43 dinked an effort off the crossbar in the second period			1
while @entity4 ' run of three straight wins meant the international break probably came at an inconvenient time for them , @entity1 's patched - together squad got some welcome time to familiarise themselves with each other			2
@entity9 initiated double sessions this week and the @entity12 looked set to reap the benefits early on , with @entity58 's cross being scooped over the top by @entity30			0
the @entity1 forward almost got through again shortly afterwards only to be halted by @entity61 's fine sliding challenge			0
@entity1 's @entity62 ( left ) and captain @entity63 ( right ) applaud after picking up their first point @entity65 was the first goalkeeper called into action , though , pushing away a header from @entity4 midfielder @entity68			1
at the other end , neither @entity30 nor @entity43 could apply the finishing touch to @entity72 's cross while @entity62 almost bundled a free - kick past @entity74			0
however , it was @entity4 who ended the half on top as right winger @entity41 's cross-cum - shot came back off the far post before @entity61 skewed a drilled effort just wide			2
@entity9 's men should have been ahead four minutes into the second period as @entity58 fed the overlapping @entity63 , yet the @entity85 skipper fired into the side netting			0
the hosts would go closer still some 10 minutes later when @entity43 waltzed beyond @entity61 and turned back on to his right foot , which he used to stab an effort against the crossbar			0
@entity1 's @entity91 ( left ) collides with his own ' keeper @entity65 during match at @entity7 @entity96 had already turned to @entity97 and @entity98 off the bench prior to that , the latter 's try being diverted over the top by @entity62 's block as the game started to open up			1
the skipper was epitomising the spirit @entity0 had asked for as he threw himself at a well - struck shot from @entity97 after @entity30 's loose pass inside his own area			0
@entity63 then went close again by nodding a header towards goal from a scrappy corner but @entity74 managed to swipe at the ball and touch it over			0
there was no sign of @entity1 , who have barely had a pre-season programme , fading in the latter stages as they have done so often this season , although @entity65 needed to rush out to stop substitute @entity120 stealing in			0
it ended all square and @entity0 stayed to clap the @entity1 fans that were chanting his name and hoping to see him again in three days time against @entity125			2
@entity1 's @entity126 ( left ) and @entity4 ' @entity127 ( second right ) clash during 0 - 0 draw at @entity7			1

@entity0 earns first point as @entity1 manager against @entity4
@entity14 boss @entity13 *claimed* this week he *'d* been offered @entity1 *job*
@entity1 move off the bottom of the table after draw at @entity7
@entity4 could have gone top of @entity38 with win
@entity143 hit woodwork for @entity4 but *visitors* could not score
home side 's best chance came through @entity43 who dinked on to bar
