by @entity0 @entity4 's second memoir , @entity5 , has sold a dismal 160,000 copies , data released by @entity2 today indicates			1
by comparison @entity9 's book @entity7 sold 600,000 copies in a single week when it was released in 2003 , leading publishing group @entity12 to believe @entity5 would be a hit			1
but sales of the book continue to plummet , and it looks increasingly unlikely bookstores will be able to sell the million hard copies the publishing group distributed to them when the book dropped earlier this month			1
who wants to buy one ? : @entity4 carries around a copy of her memoir at an @entity24 @entity23 during a book signing there last friday night from the beginning @entity9 's book has struggled to gain the necessary traction to meet the enormous expectations in sales thrust upon it by publishers			1
@entity33 reported moving only a 85,000 copies the first week it was available in stores			2
from there , it was all downhill , with the book selling only 48,000 copies it 's second week on the shelf , a 43.5 percent drop from the week previous			1
last week the book sold a dismal 26,000 copies			1
total sales for the book are unavailable , as recent ebook sales have not been disclosed , but roughly 15,000 digital copies of the book were known to have been bought the first week			2
when asked about the unexpected unpopularity of @entity5 , a spokesman for publishing company wrote off the memoir 's shaky start			1
' it will be selling for years — in hardcover , e-book , audio and paperback — and we expect it to be a successful book for @entity12 as well as our many international partners , ' @entity12 spokesman @entity55 told the @entity65 last week			2
' most importantly , reader reaction has been terrific			0
' coming soon to a discount bookstore near you : publishing company @entity12 distributed a million hard copies of @entity5 to bookstores , but only 160,000 of them have sold initial sales usually account for 30 percent of a book 's total sales , meaning @entity9 's book would have needed to sale 300,000 copies in the first week to stay on schedule			1
reader reaction has n't been quite up to snuff , either			0
the book has received 1,165 reviews on @entity81 and only 276 of them have been marked with the coveted five star label			2
a large majority of reviewers gave the book one star , with users frequently complaining that the book was a waste of money			0
' what a waste of paper			0
or for @entity96 readers , screen space			0
what was @entity12 thinking when they paid her ? not profits for sure , ' @entity100 resident @entity99 commented yesterday			0
' too bad kindle books ca n't be used for toilet paper			0
one star is five too many for this book			0
avoid like a plague , ' @entity105 , @entity106 , resident @entity104 said of the book on monday			0
' no matter how you feel about @entity4 , this book is boring and very poorly written			2
it 's not worth reading unless you need something to put you to sleep , ' a user name @entity112 wrote on june 21			0
' this book was one of the worst books i 've ever read			0
i wanted to like it but in the end , i ended - up stabbing myself in the face with a fork because of it			0
there 's nothing new in the book thus simply recycled boredom all - the - way - around , ' said another user on june 21			2
' @entity129 -- most boring thing i have ever attempted to read			0
if she had any integrity , she would refund her advance , ' an user named @entity132 wrote on @entity81 yesterday			0
@entity9 's advance for the book is unknown , however , it is rumored to be north of the $ 8 million she was paid for living history			1
that book ended up selling 1.4 million copies			1
after traveling across the @entity141 to promote @entity5 for the better part of june , @entity9 will travel to @entity143 later this week for the second leg of her tour			1
there , publisher 's hope her book will see a rebound in sales			1
' we can think of no other recent book written by an @entity141 leader to receive such an enthusiastic international reception , ' @entity152 , president and publisher of @entity12 , said in a statement last week .			1

publisher 's expected @entity4 's second memoir @entity5 to sell a million copies or more
but the book has struggled to gain traction , selling only 26,000 hard copies last week , and just 48,000 copies the week before that
@entity9 just finished the @entity141 leg of her book tour and is headed off to @entity143 , where publishers *predict* @entity5 will sell well
