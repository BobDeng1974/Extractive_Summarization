by @entity0 @entity1 : 08:31 est , 26 december 2013 @entity2 : 09:44 est , 26 december 2013 ' i do n't want to be @entity4 ... i want to be @entity5 ! ' our favourite new word at home is ' listicle '			0
in the real world it 's used to refer to the lists of funny facts which seem to populate every website my kids love			1
things like ' ten car parks that look like @entity19 ' , for example , or ' 14 kittens that dance like @entity22 '			0
these so - called listicles have tickled us			1
every day , we throw out a few family ones			0
one million reasons @entity4 thinks she is always right , as my husband is fond of muttering			0
eleven red carpet dresses @entity29 , seven , wishes he 'd worn before i stopped him cross-dressing			0
so as @entity33 is prime listicle season , i 've told the family i am compiling a personal listicle of things i will not be saying in 2014			0
why ? because after a decade of parenting i am getting sick of the sound of my own voice nagging away like a stuck record repeating the same thing again and again			2
so , @entity43 , you wo n't hear me say any of the following next year : ' clean your teeth , brush your hair , wash your hands , eat your broccoli , flush the loo , turn the computer off , turn the volume down and stop arguing			0
' also banned will be : ' leave her head alone ! ' this one is peculiar to my son , who loves to repeatedly sniff his toddler sister 's hair , provoking the same reaction in her that i 'd imagine you 'd see if you woke a hibernating bear - violent rage			1
whenever i say these things , they are either ignored or a child proposes an alternative to which no fool would agree - for example , she will flush the chain if she can have a biscuit			2
the ' asked and answered ' parenting theory is that once you 've answered a child 's question , you should n't have to answer it again my @entity33 listicle is the first step in my 2014 resolution for @entity76 ( stay with me , you may learn something ) because i am getting ever more frustrated at being the one who has to say no all the time to endless ridiculous requests from my four fabulous children			1
i do n't want to be ' @entity4 ' any more			0
i want to be ' @entity82 ' ( as the woman in the cold and flu advert says )			0
and i think i have found a solution			0
a new book by @entity89 parenting guru @entity88 reckons there are just three words you need to use to stop yourself becoming a negotiating nag			1
just three words to put an end to the relentless requests that occur on an hourly basis with children and teenagers			2
the magic words are : ' asked and answered			1
' when your child asks if they have to do their homework and you say yes , you should n't have to tell them again and this , my friends , is how you use them according to the book : child / monster - in - a - hoodie ( sorry , i mean teenager ) asks irritating question to which i have already replied no. for example : ' can i have ice cream for breakfast / wear a skirt so short my lower intestines will catch a chill ? ' instead of saying no a second time , and then being asked the same question again and again until hell freezes over , you say : ' asked and answered			1
' your perplexed but determined child / teenager asks the same question again			0
you say : ' have you asked that question before ? ' child / teenager : ' yes			2
' you : ' do i look like the kind of mum who would change her mind since the last time you asked ? ' child / teenager realises you are most definitely not the kind of mum who changes her mind			2
again you say : ' asked and answered			1
' if you like , you can draw a picture of the question and not speak at all , just point at the picture with ' asked and answered ' written under it			1
@entity88 's book about positive parenting aims to end a number of problem behaviours , and says it can spell the end to childish nagging i like the sound of this			1
with this new tactic in my parenting toolbox i wo n't need any of the nags on my listicle			2
but i will wait until the @entity33 because over the festive period we have indulgent relatives to stay whose resolution wo n't be as strong as mine			0
some of them are prone to agree to jelly and ice cream for breakfast ( recognise anyone , @entity154 ? ) so ' asked and answered ' will be devalued			1
everyone has to stick to the ' asked and answered ' rule or it wo n't work			1
mr @entity158 will need intensive training because his default reply to a question being asked 20 times is : ' @entity163			2
' he never wants to be bad cop and i suspect he would n't be much help in terrorist negotiation situations			0
if you want to come up with your own listicle , do let me know how the ' asked and answered ' approach works for you			1
particularly successful candidates might win the chance to take on the ultimate challenge - my stubborn two - year - old @entity173			0
@entity0 is editor of @entity174 .			1

mother - of - four and editor of @entity174 plans to use ' asked *&* answered ' *technique*
intention is to have to only answer children 's questions once
idea comes from new book by @entity89 parenting guru @entity88
