by @entity0 for @entity1 he was forced to drink vinegar until he feared he would throw up blood , and made others swim in pools of vomit and excrement , but now , a reformed frat boy is exposing the sordid and sometimes deadly truths behind life in a college fraternity			1
@entity12 , a 24 - year - old @entity13 student , made himself a pariah in 2012 when he wrote a blog post exposing the hazing rituals at his @entity17 , and is now calling for an overhaul of the system			1
in a new book , ' @entity20 of an @entity22 frat boy ' , he has opened up on the vile goings - on which are kept secret by fraternities and are so extreme that they have promising young students dead			2
confessions of a frat boy : @entity12 is revealing all about the sordid nature of hazing in a new book the book details his experiences at the $ 60,000 - a - year school , where he is still a student , but is on indefinite ' medical leave ' because of what people might do to him for his blog exposé			1
he tells of how boys are forced to down beer until they throw up on each other 's heads and swim in bodily fluids , while saying it is time these exclusive colleges moved on			1
' @entity47 was always part of the system for rank - and - file frat boys			1
it ’s privilege and entitlement - this whole " @entity53 " thing , ' he told the @entity54			0
reformed : mr @entity12 poses outside @entity17 's frat house , but has since exposed their activities ' but they did n’t come in as bad kids - they were n’t just released from @entity60 - they ’re fundamentally brilliant , hardworking , talented kids			1
' mr @entity12 wants rid of the traditional @entity63 system , and believes women should be allowed in to remove gender segregation			1
' the people who defend the status quo are on the wrong side of history , ' he said			0
' the only way is to abolish the structure as we know it , or modernise it to the 21st century [ by making ] it coed			0
part of the problem with frats is that we ’re not in a gender - segregated world any more			2
tell - all book : mr @entity12 's new book tells of his experiences while part of a frat , while he also calls for reform ' the school owes it to its students to abolish the system and re-purpose it			1
imagine if you could put these gorgeous houses and real estate to a good use , instead of being the place where people vomit on each other			0
' mr @entity12 's 2012 blog told how he was ' forced to chug cups of vinegar until i was afraid that i would vomit blood , ' and eat omelettes made from sick			1
he admits that he also went on to make others do similar , but has since realised he was wrong			0
his fate was far better than that of many others who have been involved with fraternities			0
in december last year , 19 - year - old @entity107 freshman @entity106 died from brain trauma , and in february 2011 another 19 - year - old - @entity110 pre-med student @entity109 - died from alcohol poisoning			2
as well as on their activities , mr @entity12 believe there should be far tougher controls on fraternity budgets , after revealing the crazy sums of money spent on booze at @entity17			1
' we would routinely drop $ 30,000 per quarter on alcohol alone , ' he said , also remembering how they had paid $ 40,000 for rapper @entity123 to play a three - song set at a party in 2009			1
' the alumni ’s love of the status quo and the college ’s lack of moral courage make it a laughing stock , ' he said , ' but they need to make the change			0
' yes , they ’ll lose donations from these rich , white guys , but the stakeholders in 30 or 40 years will have a different point of view			0
' women wo n’t write a big fat check for this reckless behaviour to continue in these basements			0
' @entity13 pursued charges against mr @entity12 for hazing after his 2012 blog post , though was cleared along with 26 other frat brothers			1
the incident also saw him lose most of his friends , and he was ostracised from @entity17 's community , as he he viewed to have brought shame on them			2
@entity17 's national leadership announced in march that it was eradicating pledging - the process of initiation into a fraternity , all together			1
pledging is the process by which someone is initiated into a fraternity , and can take as long as a year and a half to complete			0
those who are pledging a frat are known as ' pledges '			0
as well as becoming familiar with the fraternity , getting to know everyone and what is stands for , students are expected to prove themselves worthy of being made a ' brother '			2
this may be through things an innocent as cleaning the frat house and other such jobs , but can also be far more extreme activities like the one @entity12 describes			2
this darker side of initiation is known as hazing , and can often involve alcohol , drugs and sex			0
pledges can be deprived of sleep , beaten , branded , forced to drink huge amounts of alcohol and perform sexual acts			0
every national fraternity and every @entity186 university bans hazing , but that does not mean it does not still go on behind the scenes at frats all over the country .			0
