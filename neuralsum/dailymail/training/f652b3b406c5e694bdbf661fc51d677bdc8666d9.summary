by @entity0 published : 09:54 est , 22 march 2012 updated : 10:30 est , 22 march 2012 the most energetic laser shot in mankind 's history was fired at the stadium - sized @entity4 in @entity6 this month			0
on march 15 , an array of 192 lasers fired a shaped pulse of energy that generated 411 trillion watts of peak power - 1,000 times more than whole of the @entity14 uses at any one moment			1
the pulse is a historic moment for the ' fusion ' facility , which aims to generate power using a nuclear fusion reaction - similar to what happens in hydrogen bombs			1

the pulse fired this month was not aimed at a target , but scientists will eventually aim the lasers at a 1mm pellet of hydrogen to ignite a fusion reaction a worker inspects equipment at @entity6 's @entity4 : the stadium - sized @entity4 aims to be the first plant to ' break even ' with a fusion reaction , generating as much power as the lasers put in the huge high - energy facility will attempt laser fusion within the next two years			1
the technology is seen as a ' @entity43 ' of clean energy the pulse only lasted for 23 billionths of a second			2
the laser array was not firing ' at ' a target - but within two years , scientists will fire the 192 lasers at a 1mm pellet of hydrogen			1
the @entity4 scientists hope that it will ' light the fuse ' for a fusion reaction - the reaction that powers stars - which will release more energy than the lasers put in			2
' @entity62 ' nuclear fusion - the reaction in a hydrogen bomb is uncontrolled - is a @entity43 of clean energy that scientists have sought to crack since the @entity65			1
because of the incredibly short duration of the pulse , the total amount of energy required is not as huge as it sounds , and is stored in huge battery - like capacitors at @entity4			0
‘ this event marks a key milestone in the @entity76 's drive toward fusion ignition , ’ said nif director @entity72			0
‘ while there have been many demonstrations of similar equivalent energy performance on individual beams or quads during the completion of the @entity4 project , this is the first time the full complement of 192 beams has operated at this sound barrier			0
’ ignition would be a self - sustaining reaction that would release vast amounts of energy far surpassing the ' break even ' point			0
equipment at the @entity4 : the result on march 15 shows scientists could be close to the goal of ' fusion ignition ' the lasers only fire for 23 billionths of a second , but produce 1000 times as much power as the entire @entity14 uses in any given moment the facility uses pellets of the hydrogen isotopes deuterium - found in ' heavy water ' - and tritium , and fires lasers to compress the pellets to a few hundredths of its starting size			1
the reaction fuses the atoms into helium atoms , and releases fast - moving subatomic particles called neutrons which can be used to heat water and drive steam turbines			0
fusion is not , however , uncontroversial			0
the @entity4 is also associated with weapons programmes in the @entity14 - the process of fusion is also used in hydrogen bombs , and @entity4 works with @entity14 's @entity128 programme , designed to ensure its nuclear arsenal stays active			1
environmental groups such as @entity131 claim that research into fusion diverts funding from research into proven technologies such as wind and wave power .			0

' shaped pulse ' of energy generated 411 trillion watts of peak power
1,000 times more than the whole @entity14 uses at any given moment
array of 192 lasers aims for ' laser fusion ' - a ' @entity43 ' of clean energy
facility aims to ignite controleld version of reaction found in heart of stars , and in hydrogen bombs
