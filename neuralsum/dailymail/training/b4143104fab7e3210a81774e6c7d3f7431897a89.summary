more than a third of new guards at @entity2 had serious red flags raised against them - but were hired anyway , it has emerged			0
one applicant to be a @entity6 correction officer had been fired from his last job as a security guard for stealing			1
another admitted he had regularly socialized with gang members			1
another had debts of more than $ 400,000			0
a city investigation into @entity6 jail hiring practices has found dozens of recently hired guards had gang ties , previous arrests and otherwise checkered histories yet all those candidates and dozens like them were hired last year to be part of the force overseeing nearly 11,000 inmates on @entity2 , according to a yearlong city probe of jail hiring practices released thursday			1
the probe found systemic problems with the @entity28 hiring system , including no recruiting strategy for the past six years , that allowed an alarmingly high number of hires who had arrest records , gang ties or other red flags that are markers for corruption			1
department of investigation commissioner @entity38 said the chronic problems of violence , smuggling and bribery that plague the city jails can all be traced to the character and qualifications of the employees			1
' unless you have consistently qualified correction officers , solving the other problems we care about is an almost insurmountable task , ' @entity38 said			2
' this is just a function of , for a decade , hirings and screenings and investigations being ignored			0
' a barbed wire fence outside inmate housing on @entity6 's @entity2 correctional facility in @entity6 city investigators randomly pulled 153 application files of guards hired last year and found that 54 — or 35 percent — ' presented significant red flags that should have either precluded their hiring outright or required further follow - up			1
' the probe found 79 hired officers admitted having friends or family members who were inmates — including one with nine relatives who had done time in @entity2			1
ten new hires had been arrested more than once , and another 12 had been rejected by the significantly higher standards of the @entity73 , including six for psychological reasons and one who failed a drug test			0
in all , this group appeared ' simply unfit for law enforcement — whether working on the streets of @entity6 as police officers or in its jails , ' according to the report			1
jails commissioner @entity83 , who has pledged to reform the troubled correction department , said in a statement he was committed to ' improving staff recruitment , training and retention ' and would implement many of the investigators ' recommendations			2
those included automatically disqualifying applicants who had been fired from a public agency or had any felony convictions in the past five years			2
since the investigation , three of the problem hires have been fired for misconduct , including one who had an ' unduly familiar ' relationship with an inmate later arrested in a murder - for - hire plot			1
two of the hires resigned			0
corrections officials would n't say what they will do with the rest			0
the probe found systemic problems with the @entity28 hiring system , including no recruiting strategy for the past six years among other findings , there was no evidence applicants had been screened for gang affiliation , even though the jails ' own intelligence officers rank it as the top threat to safety			1
it was n't until after probe began that the jails began taking photos of applicants ' tattoos to check for possible gang ties			2
investigators deemed application investigators undertrained and found they failed to make meaningful background checks or run credit reports			0
they were also reliant on an applicant evaluation scale of 1 to 5 despite no clear understanding of whether a ' 1 ' or a ' 5 ' was the best score			2
thus , the report found , 90 percent of applicants received a meaningless ' 3 ' on the scale			0
investigators found seven instances when the deputy commissioner in charge of hiring reversed decisions to reject unqualified candidates			0
in one case , a reject who scored poorly on the psychological exam was hired after her file noted she was a family friend of @entity150 , the powerful president of the union representing 9,000 city correction officers			2
@entity150 did n't immediately return a message seeking comment			0
@entity2 has come under increased scrutiny in the past year by the media and investigators , including federal prosecutors who have sued the city to institute reforms to what it has called a ' deep - seated culture of violence			0

one applicant to be a @entity6 correction officer had been fired from last job for stealing , investigation finds
