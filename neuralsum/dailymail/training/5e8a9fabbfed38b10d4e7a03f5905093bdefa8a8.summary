@entity7 has been asked by advisors to consider putting the area on its endangered list when its world heritage committee gathers for its annual meeting next week in @entity13			1

the 400ft and 29 - storey @entity61 tower of the @entity29 development across @entity63 have been singled out for particular criticism by @entity7 , with the @entity66 tower standing ten storeys high			1
' in some views , part of the development would appear to be visually attached to the north face of the @entity72 ( formerly known as @entity73 , which houses @entity47 ) , ' says @entity7 in its agenda for next week 's meeting			2
it repeats concerns from 2006 and 2011 over the lack of a ' buffer zone ' preventing building work around the area			0
