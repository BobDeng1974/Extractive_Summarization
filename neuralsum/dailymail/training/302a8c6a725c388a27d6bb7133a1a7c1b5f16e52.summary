by @entity0 last updated at 6:31 pm on 25th january 2012 a mysterious blood - thirsty wild cat is feared to have struck again after three wallabies were found devoured on farmland			1
the trio were found stripped to the bone , with their internal organs neatly placed beside their bodies			1
examinations revealed they had suffered puncture wounds to the neck - consistent with a vicious attack by a panther - like creature			2
devoured : the remains of one of the wallabies which is believed to have been killed by the @entity16 of @entity17 , which is feared to have killed three deer earlier this month is this it ? this image of a large black animal was captured in a field in north - west @entity23 and could be the beast that is stalking the @entity25 experts now believe the animals were devoured by the @entity16 which is already believed to have killed three times this month			1
the mutilated bodies of three deer have been found in the past few weeks in countryside near @entity32 , @entity33 - just 12 miles from where the wallabies were mauled to death			1
the wallabies were found only 12 miles apart leading to the belief that it was the same cat samples of @entity41 from the predator 's first deer kill on january 4 are currently being tested to confirm whether or not a big cat is behind the killings			1
the results are expected to be revealed over the next few days			0
but big cat expert @entity47 is in no doubt over who killed the wallabies and the deer			1
mr @entity47 , 65 , said : ' there could be no creature other than a big cat that could bring down and kill these wallabies			1
' the field was surrounded by a 7ft fence and there was no apparent entry signs - so the predator must have leapt over it			0
' the killer struck over two nights			0
the first night he killed two wallabies , stripped one of the carcasses down and hid the other under a pile of leaves and straw			2
' then he came back and killed a third - devouring his further kills			0
a fourth wallaby appears to have died from a heart attack			0
' the wallabies are only about 12 miles from @entity17 so it appears that this could be the same big cat			1
' they have all the hallmarks of a panther or puma kill			0
' the wallabies , part of a private collection , were found by their devastated owner on january 6 - two days after the apparent first kill by the @entity16 of @entity17			1
the @entity33 farmer did not want to divulge his name or location			0
examination : a man completes a dna test on the carcass of one of the deer killed earlier this month which will confirm whether or not a big cat was responsible but he did release gory pictures of one of the dead wallabies			1
the carcass had been ripped open in a similar way to the three roe deers the beast is believed to have slayed			0
the first deer had been torn open and was missing its heart , kidneys and liver			0
its snout was also missing - important because big cats clamp their jaws over the mouth , causing death by suffocation			0
experts believe the deer was brought down and devoured by a large and powerful predator such as a puma , jaguar or leopard			2
@entity120 of the animal ’s fur were also found piled by the body - and such predators neatly pluck the hair from the body before shearing their teeth into the flesh			2
tests : this roe deer was killed less than 12 miles from where the big cat is feared to have devoured three wallabies another deer carcass was found by a dog walker between @entity137 and @entity138 , near @entity139 - ten miles away - on january 10			1
a third roe deer body was found at a development in @entity143 ’s edge , near @entity144 , days later			2
dr @entity145 , an expert in evolutionary genetics at @entity148 ’s @entity147 , is studying samples of dna taken from the first carcass			0
he said : ' i ’m prepared to believe in the existence of big cats in the @entity154 and we have a reasonable chance of finding out if it was there			0
' we are in the process of studying samples of dna taken from the deer and if its death was the result of a big cat then we ’re hoping it left cheek cells and saliva			2
