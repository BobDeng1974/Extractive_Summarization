by @entity0 last updated at 7:57 am on 30th september 2011 twice , my husband and i have tried to adopt children through our local authority			1
twice , the over-bureaucratic , ideologically - twisted local authority has stood in our way			1
eventually , we had to travel halfway around the world , to @entity9 , where thanks to a far more efficient , orderly , sane system we now have a beautiful three - year - old daughter , @entity13 , and one - year - old son , @entity14			1
the adoption system in @entity16 is a mess			1
the average child will wait two years and seven months to be adopted and during that time they will be bounced around the system while their birth mother – often addicted to drugs or alcohol – continues to neglect them			1
against the odds : @entity0 with three - year - old @entity13 , left , and @entity14 , six months at the same time , the desperate adoptive parents are forced to jump through every hoop the local authority asks them to			1
one of the most pernicious ideas in current thinking is that children should be placed with parents who exactly match their racial make - up			2
i am white and @entity35 – although i have lived in @entity16 for 16 years – and my husband is white and @entity16			1
our local authority , @entity38 in @entity39 , rejected our application immediately without even seeing us in the flesh			1
apparently they deemed we were too white and middle class			2
although we are medically able to have children , we chose to adopt. i have an adopted younger brother and i have seen at first hand the wonderful benefits of adoption			2
we were a perfectly ordinary , decent , suburban couple hoping to provide a child with a loving home			2
farcical : the government tried to lay down new guidelines covering ' transracial ' adoptions we were both in full - time employment : my husband @entity58 is an ex-banker who works for an energy company and i used to be global communications director for @entity61			2
we did n’t even smoke – often a problem for prospective adoptive parents			2
but we were treated like criminals			1
we were presumed guilty until proven innocent			2
the local authorities will talk to your parents and your relatives , get bank references and work references			2
it ’s extraordinary – why would we be prepared to go through all this if we did n’t want to be good parents ? it was extremely frustrating and invasive			0
we already owned our own home but we had to renovate it in order to satisfy the local council even before the process of being approved for adoption had begun			0
after they had rejected us , @entity38 even admitted they had a cap on the number of white parents who could adopt black children and in a farcical twist , after denying us the chance to adopt a non-white child from the same postcode , they suggested we adopt abroad			1
@entity9 was a bit of a roll of the dice , chosen partly because i could speak @entity96			0
the @entity9 end of the process was wonderfully efficient			0
our caseworker met us within a week , and talked us through the process			0
' we were accused of being child traffickers ' the authorities were a hundred times more caring than in @entity16			1
here , we never once met our caseworker at the @entity103			0
whenever we sent them an email , we got an automated email response , saying we could n’t contact them ; they ’d have to contact us			0
the only problem in adopting @entity13 came from the @entity16 end			1
it was a shambles every step of the way			0
we were approved by our local authority and the @entity103 before going to @entity9			0
but once we got to @entity9 , the @entity16 @entity103 lost our papers , and we had to wait three and a half months for them to post the documents to us			1
finally , when we came back through @entity118 , our two - and - a - half - month - old daughter was detained for six hours by immigration authorities , and we were accused of being child traffickers			0
invasive : local authorities will talk to your parents and your relatives , get bank and work references while they look into whether you can adopt but @entity13 settled in happily and we began to think about adopting again			0
when we returned to @entity38 to tell them that we wanted to adopt another child , we thought our chances were better as a mixed - race family			0
the local authority told us we could only adopt another @entity9 baby , from @entity38			0
what were the chances of finding a baby with that exact background in that exact postcode ! so we returned to @entity9 and adopted @entity14			0
this time , the process took only three months ( it took six months for @entity13 , because of @entity16 inefficiency )			1
to adopt a baby in @entity16 takes nearly three years			1
in february , the government tried to reverse this farcical state of affairs , laying down new guidelines covering ‘ transracial ’ adoptions , saying that race should not be an issue but inter-racial adoptions have n’t increased as a result , because local councils and social workers blithely ignore the guidelines and refuse to make the interests of vulnerable little children a priority			0
@entity0 runs the charity adoption with @entity159			0

application was rejected immediately in @entity16
' we were treated like criminals '
