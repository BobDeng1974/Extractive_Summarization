but now a ' dud ' one penny piece accidentally could sell for more than £ 2,500 - 600,000 its original value			1
the sterling penny , made from a blend of copper and nickel instead of bronze , is the only one of its kind			1
valuable : the sterling penny made from copper and nickel could be the only one of its kind in the world it was cast 1919 after the @entity21 in @entity22 subcontracted work to a factory in @entity25 , @entity26 , because was preoccupied with striking war medals			1
at the time , the @entity28 was making @entity30 pennies for use in the colonies of @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 and the @entity36			1
during a production run of standard pennies two blanks for @entity30 pennies made it into the batch			0
when the mistake was realised , one was thrown back into the furnace and the other was kept by the engineer			0
the copper - nickel coin was then passed to @entity47 , a local industrialist , and has remained in his family ever since			2
accompanying the coin is a letter from mr @entity47 in which he describes it as a ' nickel penny - the only one in the world '			1
paperwork proving the coin 's history will be included in the auction			0
unique : a letter written by the coin 's former owner , industrialist @entity47 , highlights its special value in 1919 there were 240 pennies in a pound			2
@entity67 , coin specialist at @entity69 and @entity70 , said that the @entity21 had verified the coin as original			2
he said : ' this coin has no official status because it never entered circulation			0
' following the war the @entity21 were very busy striking war medals so they subcontracted a lot of work to the @entity28 near @entity26			1
' since then it has been passed on down through his family including through the hands of his son @entity83 , who gave his initials to the famous @entity86 line of @entity88 cars			0
' the coin may have little face value but it is unique - there is nothing else like this			0
' as with all auctions provenance is everything , and this coin 's provenance is fantastic - it can be traced right the way back to its production in 1919			0
' our estimate is up to £ 2,500 but it could go for quite a bit more			1
