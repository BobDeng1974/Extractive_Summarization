a man who found a travel partner after raffling his ex-fiancee 's honeymoon place has returned from an ' amazing holiday ' - but claims there was no romance			1
@entity7 , 32 , - who became known as @entity8 - advertised on @entity9 after his girlfriend told him at @entity11 she did not want to get married			1
desperate to find a holiday partner for the £ 1,950 trip to the @entity14 , @entity8 , from @entity15 , @entity16 , tried to find a companion for the trip on @entity9			1
finally , after instead selling £ 10 raffle tickets - raising £ 1,410 for testicular cancer charity balls to @entity37 he jetted off to the @entity39 with lucky winner @entity40 - who he met for the first time at the airport			1
@entity8 said he is constantly asked if they have become a couple			2
but he said this could not have been further from his mind			2
he said : ' everyone is hoping i 've found romance again			2
i only recently split up with my girlfriend			2
' he added : ' i have made a friend out of it and it 's brilliant			2
it could have easily gone the other way			2
' to go on holiday with a complete stranger and get on is incredible			2
the pair admitted they were both feeling the nerves , as miss @entity40 told @entity61 her hands were shaking and mr @entity7 said he did n't know what to do with himself ' hopefully we will stay friends			1
i do n't see why not			0
' ms @entity40 , an attractive blonde , wrote on @entity66 : ' we are having a fantastic time and getting on like a house on fire as they say ! ' she later added : ' such great memories to take away with me though and an amazing new friend for life ! ! @entity7 was dumped by his ex-fiancee @entity74 just weeks before their @entity76 wedding ' loved every second of this crazy adventure ! ! could n't have asked for more ! ! ' mr @entity7 was left heartbroken after his ex-fiancée @entity74 told him she was n't ' ready to get married ' and left him with a spare ticket to the @entity14			1
instead of cancelling the trip , mr @entity7 decided to give the opportunity to a stranger to join him by auctioning off the £ 1,950 ticket , with offers starting at 99p			1
but when the two highest bidders - who offered £ 8,000 and £ 7,900 - failed to pay up he decided to raffle off the tickets for £ 10 instead			1
he was united with raffle winner @entity40 for the first time on @entity91 just under two hours before he was due to board the plane at @entity93 for the two - week all inclusive break			1
the advert said his desired companion must be an ' easy going down to earth ' woman , a @entity99 citizen with a passport and ' good looking would n't go amiss '			0
arriving at the airport with his parents , mr @entity7 waited anxiously to see if the woman would arrive			1
he said : ' i feel nervous			0
i do n't know what to do with myself			0
i know her name is @entity26 and what she looks like but i 'm trying to save it all for the plane			0
' mr @entity7 was undecided on how he would greet her and was debating whether to give her a hug , a kiss - or ' a high five ' and added ' i 'll see what comes naturally '			1
when they were finally introduced by a television crew they gave each other a hug			0
instead of cancelling the honeymoon he decided to auction off the tickets to a stranger who might like to join him			1
the two highest @entity9 bidders failed to pay up , so he decided to sell raffle tickets instead miss @entity40 , who had set up her own @entity66 campaign called ' take @entity40 ' said : ' i 'm nervous - my hands have just started to shake			1
i feel like a swan , quite calm on the front but underneath i 'm paddling away			0
' a television crew from @entity61 , which filmed the moment they first met , asked the pair a few ' @entity7 & mrs ' style questions before they boarded the plane			1
asked who would get the window seat @entity139 offered it up to mr @entity7 and whether they were thrill seekers or beach babes they agreed they were a bit of both			1
miss @entity40 also revealed that she ' sleeps in the middle of the bed ' and the worst habit mr @entity7 could have would be snoring , which he previously revealed he did			1
his new companion was then introduced to mr @entity7 's parents , who embraced her and their son			1
the pair flew to the @entity39 region , where they stayed in the honeymoon suite in single beds , and returned on march 3			1
this is the moment the pair first met live on breakfast television this morning			1
before then all they knew were each others names and what they looked like			0
mr @entity7 said he wanted to save chatting for the plane explaining his decision to sell off part of his honeymoon to the highest bidder he said : ' i was gutted when she said she did n't want to get married but i realised i could n't mope forever and i did n't want what i 'd already paid to the holiday to go to waste			1
' besides , i think it will be good for me to get away			0
i 'm just looking for a new friend who fancies a holiday with someone fun			0
' he claims his girlfriend of two years , @entity74 , told him she had pre-wedding nerves and could not go through with their wedding due to take place on @entity76 this year			1
but when he tried to cancel their holiday the co-op said he would only be able to claim half the cost back so he decided to keep the holiday and advertise for a new companion to join him			0
with the help of his best friend @entity191 , he set up an @entity9 auction to find someone to travel with him			2
mr @entity7 , who described himself as a slim , 5ft 9in , with dark hair who enjoys a good laugh , wrote on the advert : ' i 'm not boring , i 'm adventurous otherwise i would n't be doing something as ridiculous as this '			2
the pair stayed for two weeks at the honeymoon suite at the @entity201 in the @entity14 @entity40 had campaigned to win the ticket and was introduced to her holiday partner for the first time at the airport			1
miss @entity40 compared herself to feeling like a swan - fine on the surface but paddling underneath although the couple had been engaged for a year and due to marry on @entity76 , mr @entity7 says he harbours no bitterness to his ex-fiancee			1
speaking after the split , he said : ' i 'm just really glad she told me before we went through with the vows on our big day - i suppose i 've got to respect her honesty			2
' but i 'm certainly not going to let the money or the opportunity pass me by			0
' when i found out at the travel agent i could only get half my money back i was looking at other deals and places i could go but i thought , ' no , i wanted to go on this holiday '			0
' i called my best friend and he agreed so i headed straight to his house to make the ebay page			0
' everyone i know is taken and i 'd rather go and enjoy it with someone new that i 'd never otherwise get to meet			0
mr @entity7 admitted he could only get half his money back from the travel agent and decided he wanted to go on this holiday but would like some female company a friend help him set up an advert where he asked for an ' easy going down to earth ' woman , a @entity99 citizen with a passport and ' good looking would n't go amiss ' ' i 'm not looking for a relationship - this could be an opportunity for someone who has never had the chance to take a holiday like this before			2
' i 'm not looking for anything apart from a fun holiday			0
if the girl is sporty and wants to do some scuba diving with me that would be great too			0
' after being overwhelmed with the response , mr @entity7 pledged to donate any money over £ 1,050 to testicular cancer research			2
he added : ' people have said i 've got real balls to do this so i thought i might as well try and make some money for charity if i can to			0
' @entity40 set up her own @entity66 page to get people to buy tickets and donate to mr @entity7 's cause and eventually won the seat herself			1
she posted this message this morning after keeping her win a secret his ex-girlfriend @entity74 said : ' i just did n't feel ready to get married and @entity8 was n't my soulmate			0
obviously it 's difficult for @entity8 , i 'm finding it hard too			0
' it 's obviously not nice to finish with someone over @entity11 but i thought it was better that he knew now , sooner rather than later			0
' it was better that i called it off now than getting to the altar and not being able to go through with it			0
' fair play to @entity8			0
i 'm pleased that he 's doing something positive			0
