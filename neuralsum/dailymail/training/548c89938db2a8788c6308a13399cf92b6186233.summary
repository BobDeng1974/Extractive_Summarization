a flagship scheme launched by @entity1 to get three million people texting or emailing their blood pressure and other vital signs to their gp surgery has been quietly dropped			1
when the prime minister announced the initiative in 2011 , he said ‘ telehealth ’ had been found to be a ‘ huge success ’ – and promised three million people would use it within five years			1
he claimed it would save the @entity13 £ 1.2billion a year by keeping patients with long - term conditions like heart disease and diabetes out of hospital			1
ill health : many older people were put off by @entity1 's modern ' telehealth ' gizmos getting patients to monitor themselves – for example , taking blood pressure or blood sugar readings – and send the information remotely would make them take better care of their own health , ministers believed			1
and the @entity13 would save more money by not having to provide so many routine appointments			1
‘ this is going to make an extraordinary difference to people , ’ mr @entity1 predicted			2
but now the ‘ 3millionlives ’ project has been shelved , after subsequent research found @entity13 telehealth programmes to be expensive and largely ineffective			1
many older people were put off by having to use modern gizmos to send in their details , researchers found			1
nurses were enthusiastic , as the scheme cut their workload and ‘ empowered ’ patients to care for themselves			2
but doctors complained they were inundated by a ‘ tsunami ’ of patient data			0
and last month , academics found the extra £ 1,014 a year it cost to provide each patient with the monitoring service and equipment did not cut deaths or rates of admission to care homes			2
when the prime minister announced the initiative , he said ‘ telehealth ’ had been found to be a ‘ huge success ’ last night , gps said politicians should concentrate on getting the basics right , rather than obsessing about ‘ gadgets ’			1
dr @entity68 , who presents the @entity70 programme @entity71 , said : ‘ this expensive black box kit is n’t good value for money – and there is no gadget in the world that can help a sick person to eat , wash and dress			0
‘ @entity81 needs to invest in what works – especially hands - on human care supplied by carers who currently often do n’t have enough time to supply people ’s basic needs			0
’ but professor @entity89 from @entity90 , @entity91 , who has helped evaluate the programmes , believes telehealth still has a future			2
he said : ‘ the evidence is that telehealth does lead to lower rates of admission and speedier discharge			0
’ the 3millionlives initiative has now been rebranded , with @entity81 officials referring to it as @entity103 ( @entity104 ) , but with no ambitious targets attached			0
professor sir @entity106 , medical director of @entity81 , has written to health bosses asking them to support the revamped scheme			0
advocates of telehealth argue the popularity of smartphone health apps – which measure everything from sleep to fitness levels – make it more likely ‘ remote care ’ will become increasingly accepted			0
a spokesman for @entity81 claimed their ambition was still to help three million people with long - term conditions using remote care devices			0
he added : ‘ twenty years from now , we will use technology to access our health services as a matter of course			0
