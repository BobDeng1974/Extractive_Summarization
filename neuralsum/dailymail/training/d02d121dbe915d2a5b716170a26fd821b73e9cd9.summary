one invasive mosquito already seen in @entity1 is culex modestus , which spreads the infectious @entity4 virus public health officials are monitoring @entity7 ’s southern borders amid concerns deadly mosquitoes are heading our way			1
experts fear that the disease - carrying mosquitoes which were already spotted around @entity15 are crossing the @entity16			2
one invasive mosquito already seen in @entity1 is culex modestus , which spreads the infectious @entity4 virus			1
the disease causes serious flu - like symptoms and leads to swelling of the brain and spinal cord in the most serious cases			2
and with the continuing mild weather and global warming they could thrive across @entity27			1
species such as the @entity30 tiger mosquito act as carriers for diseases such as potentially fatal dengue fever , which can also cause shock , bleeding and organ damage			1
dr @entity36 , programme leader with @entity38 ’s medical entomology team , said authorities are monitoring the situation closely			1
he said : ‘ one of the things we are looking at is the incursion of invasive mosquitoes which act as vectors for diseases such as dengue fever and chikungunya			2
the number of cases is fairly low in @entity15 at the moment but with climate change and increased globalisation there is the potential for that to change			0
‘ given the continued spread of invasive mosquitoes in continental @entity15 , @entity38 continue to conduct surveillance at ports of entry and some motorway service stations			1
‘ we are also providing an identification service for nuisance mosquitoes			0
’ dr @entity36 said it was difficult to detect exactly how invasive species make it to @entity7 but said there was a number of potential entry routes			0
he said @entity30 tiger mosquitoes – a large and aggressive variety – breed in tyres , laying eggs which can survive dormant for up to 18 months			0
when the tyres are exported to @entity15 the eggs travel with them and hatch when conditions are right			0

the disease causes serious flu - like symptoms and leads to swelling of the brain and spinal cord in the most serious cases it is believed the insects also end up arriving on aeroplanes and lorries stopping on the continent enroute to @entity7			1
the @entity30 tiger mosquito bites during the day and is already a major problem in @entity93 and parts of southern @entity15			2
it is also identified as a carrier of chikungunya , which like dengue fever can cause severe fevers of up to 40 degrees followed by joint pain that can last for years			0
mosquitoes need water to reproduce and dr @entity36 said covering water sources would help minimise potential breeding sites			0
he said : ‘ we encourage good “ garden husbandry ” in the summer months , by reducing the number of container habitats around the garden			0
this includes turning upside down buckets , emptying paddling pools that are n’t being used , unblocking drains and putting lids on water butts			0

one mosquito was recorded spreads deadly @entity4
mild weather and global warming means they could thrive across @entity38
