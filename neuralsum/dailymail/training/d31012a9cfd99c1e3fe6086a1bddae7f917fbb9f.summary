@entity1 president @entity0 vowed at the @entity2 in @entity3 that he has n’t seen the @entity4 bid corruption report which is causing so much controversy			1
@entity0 ’s aides are claiming only six people have seen the full 430 - page findings			1
they are ethics judge @entity11 and his deputy @entity12 , investigator @entity13 and his no 2 @entity14 , plus @entity16 attorney general @entity15 and @entity17 , @entity1 ’s compliance chief			1
however , such is @entity0 ’s control of world football ’s ruling body that plenty of scepticism surrounds everything said on his behalf — especially when @entity13 ’s evidence of any wrongdoing during those murky 2018 and 2022 campaigns is of such importance to @entity1			1
@entity0 insists that he has n't seen the @entity13 report into @entity4 bidding corruption the 127th @entity32 session taking place in @entity3 this week but @entity0 — asked face to face by @entity36 during a break in the @entity2 to confirm what his @entity39 advisors insisted was true — was adamant he had not been shown @entity13 ’s work			1
@entity0 said : ‘ i can confirm 100 per cent i have not seen the @entity13 report			1
as i have said all along , the two ethics chambers act independently from @entity1			2
’ the @entity1 farce continues with @entity39 ’s appeals committee due to hear @entity13 ’s complaint this week after he disowned @entity11 ’s summary conclusions as ‘ materially incomplete ’ and an ‘ erroneous representations of the facts ’			1
@entity50 have bizarrely followed arch - rivals @entity51 in naming dressage champion @entity52 as their sportswoman of the year , despite the more obvious claims of @entity58 skeleton gold medallist @entity56 and @entity59 , who won the @entity61 10,000 metres aged 40			1
the @entity64 ’s far more relevant @entity63 vote will have the last say on sunday about who is the top @entity67 sportswoman of 2014			2
@entity52 ( centre ) is presented with the @entity50 sportswoman of the year award @entity56 won gold on the skeleton at the @entity73 in @entity74 in february @entity59 won the 10,000m at the @entity61 in august aged 40 the @entity76 have named @entity77 and @entity78 as new first - class umpires for 2015 despite an upcoming ageism employment case			1
@entity81 and @entity82 have a tribunal date in february to contest being retired from the umpires roster against their wishes when in good health at the age of 65			2
the @entity76 say they took legal advice before publishing the umpire roster ahead of the tribunal			2
... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...			2
. @entity92 , who are joining @entity94 at a @entity96 football festival in @entity97 this week to tap into the burgeoning @entity99 football market , are taking a lifesize silicon model of goalkeeper @entity101 with them for promotional purposes			0
@entity104 ’s decision time the @entity105 and @entity51 remain remarkably relaxed about @entity104 combining his coaching and pundit roles — despite his @entity109 v @entity108 comments about @entity110 and @entity111 this week once again highlighting the conflict around @entity114 players			0
@entity104 is aware of the potential dangers , saying in his newspaper column : ‘ i accept i am having my cake and eating it , with broadcasting and the @entity114 coaching role			0
i know the decision is looming			0
i committed to @entity51 for four years and @entity123 for four years and i ’m not stupid enough to think i will combine those functions for ever			0
’ the most likely outcome is that @entity104 tries his hand as a club manager after @entity128			0
@entity104 said @entity110 's match against @entity111 on sunday will be like a pub game @entity104 ( left ) is still juggling his roles @entity114 coaching role with his media work at @entity134 there is considerable concern within grass - roots sport that the fall - out from @entity114 ’s botched @entity139 will significantly affect budget plans for the financial year starting in april			1
sports have been told by @entity114 that the delay until january in receiving the amended @entity139 figures , which are central to funding decisions , means the money handed out will not be announced until march 18 , giving less than two weeks to put budgets in place			0
one chairman described the situation as a ‘ complete shambles ’			0
@entity152 insist there is no connection between the fact that their @entity157 - produced horseracing coverage has been so widely criticised , and @entity158 alone winning the tv production tender for the @entity160 when they did the @entity161 in partnership with @entity157			0
a @entity164 spokesman said the station ’s remit was to share around independent contracts .			0

@entity0 says he has n't seen report into @entity4 corruption
@entity13 's report on 2018 and 2022 bid process caused controversy
@entity50 name @entity52 as their sportswoman of the year
@entity52 beats @entity56 and @entity59 to the award
