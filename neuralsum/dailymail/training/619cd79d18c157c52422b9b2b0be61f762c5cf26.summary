@entity0 will proudly lead out @entity1 against @entity2 on saturday , and in a little over two weeks he could be given an even greater honour			2
for the 28 - year - old now looks to be the prime candidate to be @entity7 's next captain having been confirmed as @entity1 's new skipper on tuesday			2
@entity9 admitted earlier this week that the man who leads out @entity7 at @entity11 against @entity12 on september 3 will replace @entity13 as leader of the national team			0
@entity0 directs play during @entity1 's win over @entity20 stepping up : @entity0 will take on extra responsibilities for club and possibly country this season @entity27 selected to lead @entity17 ' revival and @entity0 looks to be that man now			0
in truth , @entity9 's options are limited with only @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34 as realistic alternatives to @entity0			1
another option would be current vice-captain @entity37 , but @entity9 seemed to rule him out earlier this week when hinting he may plump for @entity0			2
' @entity37 is the vice-captain and there is @entity0 , so there are two candidates , ' said @entity9			1
' at the moment , @entity37 's concentration has to be on this @entity44 job and in @entity45 , where he could very well be captain			0
honour : @entity0 captained @entity7 against @entity47 in october 2012 changing of the guard ? @entity0 ( second left ) now looks to be man to take over from @entity13 disappointment : @entity13 's @entity7 career ended with @entity7 's exit at the @entity52 captain fantastic : @entity13 in action for @entity7 against @entity55 at the @entity52 ' i do n't think i can expect him to say , " please make me captain because in 2018 i want to lead the team out " , because i do n't think he will be thinking that himself			1
' at 28 , @entity0 will still be around for the next @entity52 in @entity58			0
@entity32 , who will be 31 in 2018 , will in all likelihood also be around , but @entity33 and @entity34 will be 32 and 35 in four years and may have found themselves usurped by younger centre - backs such as @entity62 , @entity63 and @entity64			0
that seemingly leaves a straight battle between @entity0 and @entity32 , and @entity1 boss @entity67 has done @entity9 a huge favour			1
had @entity70 plumped for compatriot @entity71 as his captain at @entity1 it would have been almost impossible for @entity9 to make @entity0 his skipper			1
passion play : @entity32 is seemingly the other leading candidate to captain @entity7 down and out : @entity33 is another name that @entity9 is reported to be considering as @entity7 skipper experienced : @entity34 has captained his club side @entity78 for many years now , however , it is almost impossible for @entity9 not to choose @entity0 over @entity32 - or any other candidates he may be considering			1
already one of the obvious leaders on the pitch , captaining @entity1 week - in - week - out will surely give @entity0 the vital experience he needs to lead his country			0
what kind of captain he will turn out to be - possibly more @entity88 than @entity89 - is still unknown , but he seems to be the only game in town now for @entity9 .			0
