by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 all eyes , not to mention camera lenses , were trained on @entity4 as he emerged , carrying his boots , into the sunshine at the tidy red - and - white @entity7			1
for @entity4 , the @entity8 finally seems set to start , 39 days after his last game , played alongside five @entity11 team - mates who will be opponents in @entity12 on thursday			1
this has been a familiar pre-tournament injury saga with a slight difference			2
usually it is a key @entity17 player fighting for match - sharpness ; this time it is @entity4 , @entity20 and @entity21 , set to return for a clash that @entity23 and @entity17 dare not lose			1
fighting fit ? @entity4 is set to start against @entity17 in their @entity26 clash the big man is back , as @entity28 once said of himself , and @entity4 is anxious to help just as the @entity29 are desperate to see him reunited up front with @entity31			1
‘ trust us , ’ said @entity4 when asked for a message to the people of @entity23 , who hope this @entity8 in @entity34 will inspire their team as it did in 1950 , when they emerged as champions , beating the hosts in the final			1
‘ we want to put things right , ’ he added , reflecting on the 3 - 1 defeat by @entity42			1
‘ it is still in our hands to qualify			2
@entity8 games are tough and can be decided in only a few minutes			0
' you never know what can happen			0
it has been a hard few days since @entity42			1
the goals came at vital times and the result slightly flattered them			0
we ’re going to give our best against @entity17			1
we want to move forward as we did four years ago			0
’ keep calm : @entity4 believes the people of @entity23 can trust their national team it remains to be seen what condition @entity4 is in for his first game after knee surgery			1
on tuesday his movement did not look in any way limited as he twisted and turned , passed and dribbled in a few short and sharp training drills with @entity67			0
there was no strapping required to support the injured knee			0
earlier this week he told the @entity72 press he would not have travelled to @entity34 had he been unable to play his part and that his treatment had been ‘ fabulous ’			0
another danger for @entity17 is that the @entity4 circus , and the text messages pinging back and forth with @entity11 players in @entity17 ’s camp , has diverted attention from the rest of a strong team ranked seventh in the world			1
they have a proud tournament record , despite being humbled by @entity42 , but @entity87 manager @entity86 did not see much to concern @entity88 when his side lost 1 - 0 in a friendly in @entity91 last month , when @entity67 deputised for the injured @entity4			1
‘ we looked back at a lot of games and they are so heavily dependent on the front two , ’ said @entity86			0
‘ the rest of the team is solid and workmanlike , but they do n’t have a midfielder who is particularly creative			0
there ’s not a @entity101 in there			0
danger : @entity17 must also watvh out for @entity104 striker @entity31 ( left ) ‘ the team plays deep and the front two sometimes get isolated			1
it is a very rigid 4 - 4 - 2			0
it is not a typical @entity29 game			2
@entity4 and @entity31 want the ball early			1
they did n’t get a lot of men forward against us			0
they do n’t press like , say , @entity112 or @entity113			0
‘ at the back , @entity114 wants to play so deep that the team gets fractured			0
@entity23 see him as a mainstay and a leader			2
i think he is the one you can play on , with the pace @entity17 have			2
‘ if you look at the third goal against @entity42 , @entity114 should get across and he just does n’t have the legs anymore			2
solid ? @entity17 may be able to play on @entity114 's lack of pace at the back ' neither of the central midfielders is a goal threat			1
they like to put their foot in , but they do n’t get in the box			0
they condense the pitch and rely on the front two			0
this could be the one time @entity17 go with two out - and - out strikers			2
’ @entity23 boss @entity139 has warned there will be changes after the @entity42 debacle and @entity143 is expected to come in at right back for @entity144 , who is banned			1
@entity86 added : ‘ that might suit @entity23 a little more because they will play with a defensive full back			2
’ mixing it up : @entity139 has revealed there will be changes to @entity23 's team			1

@entity4 looks set to start for @entity23 against @entity17 on thursday
striker missed @entity23 's opening game against @entity42
@entity17 must also be wary of @entity31
@entity4 has called for @entity23 fans to ' trust ' their national
