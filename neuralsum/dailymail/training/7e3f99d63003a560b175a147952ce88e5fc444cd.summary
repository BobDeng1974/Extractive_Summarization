bag carrier : @entity1 leaves a radio station with an unknown woman on saturday if @entity1 was hoping to blend in with the crowd , this bag was not the way to do it			1
covered in gaudy pink swirls , it stuck out like a sore thumb as he walked through @entity10 in central @entity11 on his way home from presenting his @entity15 radio show			1
but as he strolled out with a woman who left the offices with him , he looked perfectly at ease – and between them , they even managed to get a taxi , despite mr @entity1 ’s recent rant at a driver			2
the former @entity25 minister , 65 , was caught on tape last month calling a cabbie a ‘ sweaty , stupid little git ’ when he became furious at the route taken by the driver after a visit to @entity32 , where mr @entity1 ’s partner @entity33 had received a cbe			1
mr @entity1 yelled : ‘ i ’ve been in the @entity35 , i ’m an award - winning broadcaster , i ’m a @entity37 ’ , before demanding : ‘ who are you to question me ? ’ cabbies vowed to refuse to pick up mr @entity1 as a result			1
but on saturday , when these pictures were taken , his unusual bag – and not his language – was the most colourful thing on display			0
an onlooker said : ‘ he came out of the radio station with the woman and they walked through the square			0
she raised her arm to hail the taxi			0
‘ as soon as it stopped , they both stepped out on the street and mr @entity1 opened the door for her , said something to the driver then got in himself			0
there did n’t seem to be any problem			0
’ it was unclear if mr @entity1 was , in an act of chivalry , carrying the eye - catching bag for the unknown woman , who herself was carrying a large black and white bag , or if it was his own			2
