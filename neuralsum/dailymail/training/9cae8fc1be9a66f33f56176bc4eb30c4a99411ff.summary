@entity2 died from multiple injuries after he accidentally fell from the bedroom window of his grandfather ’s flat in @entity7 in may last year			1
his traumatised 10 - year - old sister @entity22 is believed to have grabbed on to her brother as he climbed on to the window sill from a chest of drawers and may have been trying to prevent him from falling , the inquest at @entity20 heard			1
retaining locks which would prevent the window from opening too wide had been removed since new double glazing was installed in the flats in @entity31 , in the @entity33 area of the city , in 2005 , the inquest was told			1
@entity35 , head of repairs and maintenance for council housing , said the locks were fitted as standard but could be moved or removed with an allen key			2
he said @entity40 , who was the tenant of the flat and @entity2 ’s grandfather , may have removed the locks which were supplied with the windows			1
investigations found the locks were in place on one window in the living room			2
recording a verdict of accidental death , coroner @entity49 said : ' when the windows were fitted , they should have had these retaining locks on			1
' the point of these retaining locks is they are removable , adjustable , you can slide it up and down to adjust the gap the window goes to and you could , if you wanted to , remove them altogether			1
' he added : ' the point of the locks is , if you do have active children , they can prevent the window opening to a dangerous level			1
' had these blocks been on and set at a level which would restrict the width the window could open , this accident could have been prevented			0
' he said he would write to the landlord of the property in @entity31 , in the @entity79 area , and recommend they look into fitting all windows with static inhibitors to prevent them opening too wide			0
he also said he would recommend regular inspections of the properties to ensure safety features are in place and working			0
@entity2 ’s mother , @entity87 , who sat with her husband @entity88 , left the room in tears at one point as mr @entity49 described her son as ' a very active little boy , full of mischief '			0
retaining locks which would prevent the window from opening too wide had been removed since new double glazing was installed in the flats ( pictured ) in 2005 , the inquest was told			1
@entity2 fell from the eighth floor mrs @entity87 said that her father - in - law had not removed the retaining locks from the windows			1
mr @entity49 said to her : ' your belief is there were never any little blocks on the bedroom windows			0
' the inquest heard that @entity2 , with his mother , father and siblings , had been living in his grandfather ’s one - bedroom flat for three weeks while they waited to be rehoused			1
on the day of @entity2 ’s death , on may 31 , the family were in the bedroom of the flat for around three hours while workers replaced carpet tiles in the living room			2
furniture from the living room had also been moved into the bedroom , including a chest of drawers that had been moved underneath the window to make room for extra furniture			0
after the carpet was laid , the adults began to move the furniture back into the living room , leaving @entity2 and his sister playing in the bedroom			2
a short time later , at around 5.15pm , @entity2 ’s sister came into the living room to tell her mother @entity2 had fallen			2
she later told police that she was getting cross with her brother as he was not listening to her when she told him to stop climbing on the chest of drawers			0
mr @entity49 said : ' she said she had hold of @entity2 when he fell from the window			2
she might have realised he was in some danger and tried to prevent it			0
' he added : ' she had got cross with her brother because i do n’t think he would listen or do what she was telling him and she said he accidentally fell from the window			1
she might have been trying to get him down			0
' mr @entity49 said the window in the bedroom was opened as the room became ' very warm and stuffy ' and the adults were smoking			0
@entity2 ’s uncle @entity155 found the young boy lying on the grass outside and left him with his mother while he went to get an ambulance			0
@entity2 was taken by ambulance to the @entity161 but died a short time later			2
mr @entity49 told @entity49 and mrs @entity87 : ' when you are living in what was an unsuitable and cramped condition because of the circumstances you were in , it does mean even further diligence and supervision has to be made when you have hyperactive children , who understandably have no sense of danger and are too young to have regard for their own safety			0
' speaking after the inquest , mr @entity2 , 36 , said they wanted to move on with their lives			0
he added that he agreed with the coroner ’s recommendations			0
two men , aged 57 and 36 , a 28 - year - old woman and a 16 - year - old girl were arrested on suspicion of child neglect but were not charged .			1
