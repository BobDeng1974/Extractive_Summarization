by @entity0 type 2 diabetes could cause the brain to age by up to two years every decade a person has the disease , researchers have claimed			2
it is the first time diabetes has been linked to a change in the size of the brain			2
the study also found that , contrary to common clinical belief , diabetes may not be directly associated with small vessel ischemic disease , where the brain does not receive enough oxygenated blood			1
doctors found that for every 10 years a patient has diabetes , their brain looks approximately two years older than that of a non-diabetic person in terms of gray matter volume			1
according the @entity29 ( @entity29 ) , nearly 26 million people in the @entity28 have diabetes , and 1.9 million more are diagnosed with the disease each year			1
type 2 is the most common form of diabetes			2
in type 2 diabetes , either the pancreas does not produce enough insulin or the cells ignore the insulin that is produced			0
the @entity29 estimates that , based on current trends , as many as one in three @entity28 adults will have diabetes in the year 2050			1
' we found that patients having more severe diabetes had less brain tissue , suggesting brain atrophy , ' said lead author @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , professor of radiology at the @entity54 at the @entity55			1
' they did not seem to have more vascular disease due to the direct effect of diabetes			0
' according the @entity29 ( @entity29 ) , nearly 26 million people in the @entity28 have diabetes , and 1.9 million more are diagnosed with the disease each year			1

' as diabetes becomes more common , better understanding of the disease and its management becomes even more important in order to minimize its effect on patient health , ' dr. @entity50 said			0
for the study , dr. @entity50 and colleagues used magnetic resonance imaging ( @entity82 ) to investigate the association between severity and duration of type 2 diabetes mellitus and brain structure in 614 patients ( mean age 62 years )			0
the mean duration of disease in the study group was 9.9 years			0
the researchers specifically tested whether more severe diabetes was inversely correlated with brain volumes and positively correlated with ischemic lesion volumes			0
the @entity29 estimates that , based on current trends , as many as one in three @entity28 adults will have diabetes in the year 2050			1
the results showed that longer duration of diabetes was associated with brain volume loss , particularly in the gray matter			1
however , the study found no association of diabetes characteristics with small vessel ischemic disease in the brain			2
' diabetes duration correlated primarily with brain atrophy , ' dr. @entity50 said			0
' stated another way , our results suggested that , for every 10 years of diabetes duration , the brain of a patient with diabetes looks approximately two years older than that of a non-diabetic person , in terms of gray matter volume			2
" the researchers noted that their findings may have implications for future decline of cognitive function in patients with diabetes and raise the possibility that such cognitive changes might not be strongly related to vascular dementia but to neurodegenerative disorders , such as alzheimer 's disease .			0
