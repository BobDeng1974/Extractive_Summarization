the body of the product is pure die - cast aluminium			1
this means it is incredibly strong but still light weight			2
the aluminium is painted , lacquered and then baked to give a semi-gloss finish			2
the majority of the space inside the @entity33 is taken up by an energy dense lithium - ion rechargeable battery			1
this battery is a @entity75 battery , rated at 220 milliamp hours			0

the device can also track levels of glucose , lactate , and @entity127 , providing valuable data for physiologic monitoring during activity , or in possible disease conditions like diabetes			0
the world 's smallest guitar -- carved out of crystalline silicon and no larger than a single cell was made at @entity137 to demonstrate a new technology that could have a variety of uses in fibre optics , displays , sensors and electronics			0
the ‘ nanoguitar ’ -- made for fun to illustrate the technology was just one of several structures that @entity137 researchers believe are the world 's smallest silicon mechanical devices .			0

@entity7 is 1.3 inches long and can provide an extra 30 minutes ' talk - time
