by @entity0 some of the earliest photos of @entity3 women have come to light in a revealing and historical album of prints from the pioneering days of photography 150 years ago			2
the rare set of pictures taken by @entity10 , one of @entity12 ’s first female photographers - whose work was avidly collected by @entity15 writer @entity14 - is set to fetch £ 150,000 at auction			1
the photos , which date back to the 1860s , were taken by @entity10 of her daughters and rank as one of @entity12 ’s first ever fashion shoots			1

born @entity50 in @entity51 in 1822 , she was the third of five children of a @entity12 father , admiral @entity54 ( 1774 - 1840 ) , and a @entity56 mother , @entity55 ( 1800 - 1880 )			2
one of five children , she grew up on the family estate , @entity59 , near @entity60			0
much of @entity10 ’s life remains a mystery			2
but in 1845 she married @entity63 , an officer in the @entity64			0
in 1856 , @entity63 ’s father , @entity65 , died and his title , and considerable wealth , passed to @entity63			0
@entity10 and her husband had ten children , two boys and eight girls , out of whom eight survived to adulthood			1
in 1859 , the family also acquired a new @entity75 home at 5 @entity76 , in @entity77			1
much of the square survives as built , but no. 5 has gone			0
from 1862 onwards , @entity10 used the entire first floor of the property as a studio , within which she kept a few props , many of which have come to be synonymous with her work : gossamer curtains ; a freestanding mirror ; a small chest of drawers ; and the iconic ‘ empire star ’ wallpaper , as seen in several of the photographs			1

above , @entity35 the superior aspect of the studio can also go some way to account for @entity10 ’s sophisticated , subtle and pioneering use of natural light in her images			1
it was also here that @entity10 focused upon taking photographs of her eldest daughters , @entity35 , @entity10 , and @entity119 , whom she would often dress up in costume tableau			1
the girls were frequently shot - often in romantic and sensual poses - in pairs , or , if alone , with a mirror or with their back to the camera			1
@entity10 ’s photographic exploration of identity - and female sexuality - was incredibly progressive when considered in relation to her contemporaries , most notably @entity131			1
@entity132 said in his book , @entity134 ( 1974 ) : ' @entity10 struck out into areas and depicted moods unknown to the art photographers of her age			2
her vision of languidly tranquil ladies carefully dressed and posed in a symbolist light is at opposite poles from mrs @entity131 ’s images ... her work ... constitutes a unique document within nineteenth - century photography			1
' @entity10 's daughter @entity147 ( left ) , who is also seen facing the camera with another girl on the balcony of their @entity75 house she exhibited , and won silver medals , in the 1863 and 1864 exhibitions of the @entity155 , and was admired by both @entity156 , and @entity14 who acquired five images which went into the @entity158 and are now in @entity159			1
tragically , @entity10 was never to collect her medals			2
she died at on 19 january 1865 , after suffering from pneumonia for one week , aged 42			0
it has been suggested that her immune system was weakened by constant contact with the photographic chemicals			0
now an important collection of 37 albumen prints by her and a pair of pencil sketches of her and her husband are to be sold			0
the images are derived from a single album , the vast majority not represented in the @entity173 ’s collection , where the majority of her work is housed			2

( @entity35 , pictured ) ' her output was prolific and she won awards for her work			1
she struck out into areas and depicted moods unknown to the art photographers of her age			0
' the photography scene at this point in history was dominated by males so for a female to achieve the amount of recognition she did in such a short space of time was a tremendous achievement			0
' most photography was very masculine and mostly architectural so these elegant , feminine shots really stood out at that time			0
' in 1939 , her granddaughter presented the @entity173 with 779 photographs , most of which had been roughly torn from their original albums with significant losses to corners			0
proper examination , and appreciation of this gift , was delayed by @entity217 , and it was not until the 1980s that there was a detailed appraisal and catalogue of the @entity173 holdings			0
this comprises almost the entire body of @entity10 ’s surviving work apart from the five images now in @entity159 , and small groups or single images at @entity229 , @entity230 and the @entity231			1
some smaller images are arranged on album leaves that are still intact - measuring 322 x 235mm			0
as distinct from the @entity173 ’s holdings , it is presumed that these images have been taken from an album which may have belonged to one of the sitters or their siblings			0
the most significant group in the present collection are all approximately 198 x 144mm			0
and tend to depict one figure in the first floor front room at 5 @entity76			0
curiously there are no images of this size in the @entity173 collection , but the presence of close variant images in a smaller format suggests that @entity10 was using two cameras in the same session			2
the photographs have been in the same private collection for the last 50 years and will be auctioned by @entity180 in @entity75 on march 19 .			2

photos dating back to 1860s were taken by @entity10 of her daughters
she dressed her three eldest girls - @entity35 , @entity10 , and @entity119 - in costume tableau at their @entity75 home , which acted as studio
they were shot - in romantic and sensual poses - in pairs , or , if alone , with a mirror or with their back to the camera
@entity14 was a big *fan* of @entity10 's work
