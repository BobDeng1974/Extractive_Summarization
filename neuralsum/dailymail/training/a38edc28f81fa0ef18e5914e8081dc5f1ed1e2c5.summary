by @entity0 published : 16:37 est , 28 april 2012 updated : 06:05 est , 30 april 2012 the cost of having a @entity3 address is to rise by a staggering 30 per cent tomorrow – hitting small businesses , charities and sports clubs			1
consumer groups say they have only just found out about the increase from £ 170 to £ 222 as the news was buried in the small print when the @entity11 announced price hikes for stamps , which also come into effect tomorrow			1
the latest rise means that the annual cost of a @entity3 has soared almost fourfold since 2009 , when it cost just £ 62 a year			1
hikes : @entity11 has increased the cost of sending post to a @entity3 fourfold since 2009 consumer watchdog which ? said : ‘ many people use @entity3 to keep their business and personal correspondence separate			1
' they have been stunned by the size of the increase			0
’ one reader of which ? wrote : ‘ this is frankly obscene ! i feel like i have been attacked , mobbed			0
' i do understand that prices need to go up , and usually do go up , but by this much ? this is outrageous			0
’ @entity11 says it has lost £ 1 billion on its core postal business over the past four years as it is delivering fewer letters but to more addresses			2
part of the price rise on @entity3 is due to the introduction of @entity40 on the service			1
the @entity11 admitted the rise would be ‘ difficult ’ but said : ‘ we have thought very carefully about the impact on our customers and on our own business			1
’ meanwhile stores are bracing themselves for a last - minute rush to buy stamps today , before the cost of first - class postage rises from 46p to 60p , and second - class from 36p to 50p			0
going up : @entity11 is to be given the freedom to set its own prices for first - class stamps the hikes come after an overhaul of the rules governing @entity11 , which the government plans to privatise from 2013 , was announced by communications regulator @entity60			2
it follows an @entity60 consultation from october , last year , which endorsed the removal of price constrictions			0
the @entity60 changes actually mean @entity11 can charge as much as it likes for first class stamps , while second class stamps have been capped at 55p at today 's prices , rising with inflation - a potential 53 per increase			1
as the nation 's ' @entity70 ' of postal services , @entity11 will continue to be constrained on what it can charge for second class post - but at 55p , @entity60 has set the cap at the very top end of the price range put forward in the october consultation			1
the cap , which can rise with inflation each year , will extend to second class small parcel and large letters up to 2kg in weight			2
the overhaul has been prompted by a financial crisis at @entity11			2
the service , which is currently owned by the state , has faced increased competition from private delivery firms and a collapse in postal demand as individuals and businesses move to electronic communications , including email and social media			0
@entity99 , chief executive of @entity11 , said in march this year : ' we know how hard it is for households and businesses when our economy is as tough as it is now			2
no - one likes to raise prices in the current economic climate but , regretfully , we have no option			0
' @entity11 has lost £ 1 billion over the last four years ; the sustainability of the service is now at risk			0
price increases are needed to return the @entity70 to sustainability			0

consumer groups accuse @entity11 of ' *burying* ' increase in small print of price rise *announcement*
annual cost of @entity3 soared fourfold since 2009
