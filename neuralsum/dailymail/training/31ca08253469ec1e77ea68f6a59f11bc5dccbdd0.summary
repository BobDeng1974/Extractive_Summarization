prehistoric hunters in @entity1 lived through a ' @entity2 ' where they mined metal from fallen space rocks to make weapons , according to archaeologists			1
@entity8 researchers have found evidence that suggests ancient cultures in @entity1 were making tools from a meteorite they found on the ice more than 1,200 years ago			1
this was nearly 300 years before @entity17 settlers from @entity18 arrived in @entity1 and are thought to have brought iron with them made from ore on @entity21			1
prehistoric @entity22 made spears like the one above with a point made from iron mined from a meteorite with no metal naturally accessible in @entity1 , the discovery suggests that the meteorite was responsible for kickstarting the @entity29 in the country and allowing the native hunters to develop new metal technology			1
the meteorite is thought to have crashed into the @entity1 ice sheet around the @entity34 in north west @entity1 , around 10,000 years ago and split into at least eight large pieces			1
@entity1 is one of the largest frozen landscapes in the world , with much of the land covered with giant ice sheets			2
the first humans are thought to have arrived in @entity1 around 2500 @entity42 , and was repeatedly colonised by waves of immigration from the islands north of @entity46			2
the first @entity48 cultures to arrive on @entity1 were the @entity50 culture , who appear to have intermittently inhabited the western reaches of the country island between @entity54 and @entity55			1
two other unique cultures , known as the @entity57 also arose on @entity1 over the same period until the @entity58 arrived in @entity59			0
they continued until @entity61 , although the early @entity62 began arriving around @entity63			0
it is thought that the @entity66 's take over of the trade in meteorite iron is thought to have been partly responsible for the demise of the @entity71 culture			2
the @entity17 began settling in the southern part of @entity1 in around 980ad before spreading and bringing with them iron from elsewhere in @entity75			1
among them was an enormous lump of iron known as @entity80 , or the tent , which weighs around 31 tons , a 22 ton piece called @entity83 , a 2.5 ton chunk called the @entity84 , weighing half a ton			0
these are now all housed at the @entity87 after being transported there by arctic explorers in the 19th century			0
however , archaeologists from the @entity91 have now found evidence that the native ' @entity22 ' who lived in the area had been knocking fragments off these boulders for hundreds of years			1
they found piles of basalt stones weighing up to 40kg ( 88lbs ) that had been carried to the locations where the meteorites were found where they were used to hammer pieces off the meteorites			1
the metal was then used to forge a knife or harpoon blade			0
dr @entity109 , an archaeologist from the @entity91 , told online magazine @entity110 : ' we knew the locations because what we have here are large scientific objects , but the story of the meteorites as the whole area 's source of iron have sunk into oblivion			2
' together with a team of archaeologists from @entity8 and @entity1 , dr @entity109 and his colleagues discovered huge piles of hammer stones			1
@entity129 , an archaeoloigst from the @entity130 , measured the piles using a drone and estimates that they may contain up to 70 tonnes of hammer stones			0
the @entity135 , or @entity136 , fragment of the @entity135 , above , weighs 34 tons but was mined for iron the @entity135 fragment , also called the man , of the meteorite now sits outside the @entity142 in @entity143 ( seen above ) but the iron rich space rock brought new material for weapons to @entity1 the 34 ton @entity135 meteorite fragment was mined for centuries before it was moved by @entity151 polar explorer @entity149 , seen above posing next to the meteorite in its original location , to the @entity151 this would suggest that huge amounts of iron had been mined from the meteorites over the years			1
' they did a heck of a lot of hammering , ' said dr @entity162 , another archaeologist involved in the research from the @entity91			0
' the blacksmiths would start by knocking off a small piece , thoroughly beating it flat and giving it a sharp edge , then hardening it further so that it could serve as an arrowhead or flensing knife			0
' analysis on iron tools from the area show that it had come from these meteorites as they have a distinctive chemical signature that includes traces of nickel			0
the meteorite broke up over the @entity34 in north west @entity1 , scattering on the ice sheet polar explorers transported the @entity135 meteorite fragment to the @entity87 it is through early @entity22 , also known as the @entity71 people , began exploiting the iron in the meteorites in the mid eighth century			1
when the @entity62 , an early @entity190 people , arrived in the 12th century , they took over the trade in meteorite iron			0
weapons made from the meteorites have been found as far away as @entity46			2
in southern @entity1 , which was the first area to be occupied by the @entity197 , just one single fragment of the meteorite has been found			2
it is thought that they had no need to use the meteorite iron as they had access to iron from terrestrial ore			0
dr @entity109 added : ' it has been traded over large distances and testifies to the significance of the meteorites from the @entity66 as a source of iron in the @entity211			0

@entity8 archaeologists found evidence that early @entity48 hunters broke iron from giant meteorites on the @entity1 ice sheet using basalt stones
a meteorite broke apart and fell onto the ice sheet around 10,000 years ago
the iron it contained was used to make knives and harpoons for centuries
iron from the @entity1 meteorite has been found as far away as @entity46
scientists say the huge chunks of meteorite kickstarted @entity1 's @entity29 long before @entity17 settlers brought iron ore from @entity21 to the island
