if you have two left feet and your dance moves are bad enough to clear the floor at a wedding reception , @entity0 may soon be able to help			1
a patent awarded to the tech giant this week suggests its headset could teach wearers how to dance to any kind of music			1
' @entity12 - like ' technology would recognise a tune and suggested dance moves would be shown on the heads - up display that a user could copy			1
a patent rewarded to @entity18 suggests its headset could teach wearers how dance to any kind of music			1
' @entity12 - like ' technology would recognise a tune , and suggested dance moves would be shown on the heads up display that a user could copy ( illustrated in this image from the patent ) @entity12 is an app that can ' listen ' to songs are identify the track name and artist			1
the patent suggests that a wearer of the smart spectacles could watch a video of other people dancing in order to understand how the moves should look before following the instructions themselves			1
and it seems that instructions would show steps in real time , like those for dancing games such as @entity47 , so users could dance along in time			2
in order to work , the device would have to search for appropriate dance moves to fit the beat of a song , which hints that a database of dance moves would be needed , @entity49 reported			1
the @entity57 reads : ‘ the content identification module may provide information associated with a content of the media sample , such as identification of the song and the dance , to the wearable computing system			0
the patent suggests that a wearer of the smart spectacles ( stock image ) could watch a video of other people dancing in order to understand how the moves should look , before following the instructions themselves @entity18 's chairman , @entity75 , said that the company has n't stopped working on @entity0			1
it stopped selling the first generation device in january and moved research to another part of the firm			0
@entity75 said ' it is a big and very fundamental platform for @entity18 , ' supporting rumours that a second generation model is in the works			0
it is rumoured to have battery life , sound quality and an improved display , as well as being cheaper			0
‘ the wearable computing system may determine dance steps corresponding to the content of the media sample and may generate a display of the dance steps on the @entity96 [ head mounted display ]			0
’ as well as the prospect of performing some embarrassingly outlandish movements compared to those with natural rhythm , perhaps the biggest drawback with the idea is that users would have to wear the attention - grabbing spectacles on a night out			0
wears of @entity0 have been already been branded glassholes			2
as with all patents , there is no guarantee @entity18 will develop the idea further - although @entity75 has recently said that the tech giant has n’t given up on @entity0			2
@entity18 ’s @entity115 told @entity116 that its technology is too important to scrap , despite the fact that the firm stopped selling the controversial device in january and has closed its @entity122			0
the system could risk giving users some embarrassingly outlandish movements to use on a dance floor , but seeing as it 's designed to help those with two left feet ( stock image ) , the instructions may still be an improvement overall glass has been moved to a stand - alone research unit and is reportedly being made ready for users			1
' it is a big and very fundamental platform for @entity18 , ' mr @entity75 said			0
' we ended the @entity122 program and the press conflated this into us cancelling the whole project , which is n’t true			0
' @entity18 is about taking risks and there ’s nothing about adjusting @entity0 that suggests we ’re ending it			2
' he said that ambitious projects such as @entity0 and @entity18 's self - driving car simply take time			2
@entity18 is rumoured to be working on the next generation of @entity0 , which is expected to have better battery life , sound quality and an improved display , as well as being cheaper .			0
