@entity0 may be in hot water again over a story he shared years ago about his work as a volunteer firefighter			1
@entity0 said in a 2011 interview that while he was a teenager , he ran into a burning home and while conducting a search , came across some thing ' warm and squishy			1
' when he got outside he realized he had saved a puppy			2
a few years earlier though , in an interview with @entity12 , there were two puppies			2
i was wearing a breathing apparatus , conducting a search on my hands and knees , when i felt something warm , squishy and furry on the floor of a closet , ' @entity0 told @entity39 in 2011			2
' i instinctively tucked it in my coat			0
when i got outside , i saw two small eyes staring up at me , and i returned the 3 - week - old ( and very scared ) puppy to its grateful owners			0
' in a july 2005 interview with @entity12 however , the embattled news anchor said ; ' all i ever did as a volunteer fireman was once save two puppies			1
' this as @entity0 recently confessed that he ' made a mistake recalling ' a flight he took on a @entity53 helicopter over @entity21 in 2003			1
@entity0 had said in a new segment that the aircraft he was on was hit by a rocket - propelled grenade that miraculously did n't explode , and that he and those aboard managed to land with no loss of life			0
that story too seemed to change too as it was being recounted by @entity0 though , as during an appearance on the @entity62 with @entity63 he said ; ' two of our four helicopters were hit by ground fire , including the one i was in , @entity69 and @entity70			1
' the whole thing went down in flames though when two men who were on the chopper called out @entity0 on his version of events , saying they never took any enemy fire			1
@entity0 is now also being questioned over claims he made in the wake of @entity81 ( above ) @entity82 has now launched a probe , and more of @entity85 's stories are now being questioned , including one in which he claimed to see a body floating down the street in the @entity89 of @entity90 in the wake of @entity81 , right past the @entity91 where he was staying			1
the lack of flooding in that area makes this sighting seem unlikely to some			0
he also claimed during the trip to be one of the few people to come down with dysentery , something that was not prevalent in the flood waters at that time , and that he witnessed a suicide			0
and @entity82 is not the only network looking into @entity0 , as reports have emerged that @entity106 is now doing the same in hopes of finding other possible false claims made by the newsman			1
it is being reported that @entity111 ( left ) thinks @entity0 ( right ) should be fired ' this has been a difficult few days for all of us at @entity113 , ' @entity113 president @entity112 said in a staff memo circulated friday			0
' yesterday , @entity0 and i spoke to the @entity119 team			2
and this morning at the @entity121 , we both addressed the wider group			0
@entity0 apologized once again , and specifically expressed how sorry he is for the impact this has had on all of you and on this proud organization			0
' as you would expect , we have a team dedicated to gathering the facts to help us make sense of all that has transpired			0
we 're working on what the best next steps are â€“ and when we have something to communicate we will of course share it with you			0
' should @entity0 decide to step down , or be let go , there is one person who has already made it clear she would love to fill his role - @entity140			2
there have also been reports that former @entity119 anchor @entity111 believes @entity0 should be fire .			1

@entity0 said in a 2011 interview that as a volunteer firefighter he once saved a puppy from a house *engulfed* in flames
in a 2005 interview however he said he saved two puppies
this as the @entity82 news anchor was forced to confess he ' made a mistake recalling ' that a helicopter he was on in @entity21 took enemy fire
now some are also questioning claims he made about @entity161 , including the fact he saw a body floating in the @entity89
@entity82 has launched a probe though @entity0 remains the anchor for their @entity119 *program*
