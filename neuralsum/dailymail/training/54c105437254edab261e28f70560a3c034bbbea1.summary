by @entity1 reporter published : 05:47 est , 4 may 2012 updated : 06:50 est , 4 may 2012 the asparagus season faces ruin this year after the wettest april on record has led to a national shortage			1
growers usually start cutting the green spears by the end of last month but so far , hardly any have appeared			1
prices of the popular @entity11 vegetables have rocketed from £ 6 to £ 10 per kilo in supermarkets , where it has been flying off the shelves in recent years due to tv cookery programmes			1
in demand : the growing popularity of @entity18 is being offset by a shortage after the april showers reduced crop levels the weather has also lead to the cancellation of this weekend ’s traditional @entity24 in @entity25 , @entity26 , where many growing fields have been flooded this week			1
the asparagus season only lasts around seven weeks from may 1 to june 21 , and there are fears the whole £ 20million @entity24 crop of around 5,000 tons , could be a write - off if the weather does not improve soon			1
@entity34 , the chairman of the @entity35 , said the wet weather has resulted in a cold soil when the vegetable needs warm , dry dirt to flourish			1
he said : ‘ things are really very desperate			1
we had two very heavy frosts in april followed by an awful lot of rain and that has cooled the soil right down			1
‘ asparagus requires warm and dry soil in april in order to grow and it just has n’t grown			1
it is the same picture across the @entity52			1
there is virtually nothing out there			2
’ 500,000 tonnes of @entity18 are grown every year 150 growers in @entity52 in 2010 , the retail crop was valued at £ 18.2m 6m tonnes are produced by @entity57 each year - more than any other nation there are also concerns for this month 's annual @entity61 as the cold and sodden weather may lead to fungal diseases in the ground			1
many designers have had to quickly rethink and redesign previous plans in an attempt to avoid what some are saying may be the dullest displays			1
@entity71 , editor of @entity73 magazine , said ' the rain has certainly been a relief from the drought but without warmer temperatures and wind the ground becomes waterlogged which encourages fungal diseases			2
' if this sort of weather carries on it will be very challenging for designers at @entity61			1
' but many plants are grown undercover and in carefully controlled conditions so they should be fine			2
' mr @entity71 also advised householders to aeriate their lawns with forks to bring life into them			2
he said : ' the laws are just muddy and people need to get a big fork and jump up and down on it a lot			2
' the drought in the late winter would have slowed growth and weakened roots			2
the rain has then drowned the roots and prevented access to air so drainage is essential			2
' it is more than likely that the grass is growing poorly and is not likely to get too long but that will not be the case for everyone			2
' the @entity108 in @entity25 has been cancelled this year because of the downpour meanwhile , a major knock - on effect near - constant rain has seen the number of people visiting garden centres to buy plants and products needed			0
some businesses have reported a 25 per cent loss in trade compared to april 2011			0
however , it was not all bad news for garden centres			0
@entity123 reported a 49 per cent rise in sales of waterbutts and a 145 per cent increase in demand for wellington boots for april			0
@entity130 , owner of @entity132 based in @entity133 , @entity134 , said their profits were down by 25 per cent			0
there have also been concerns for the @entity61 over the torrential downpour in april he said : ' last year 's april was a mix of sun and rain but we had the @entity145 bank holiday and an early may bank holiday which helped			1
' this year people just have n't been gardening because of the weather			1
it has n't just been wet is has also remained very cold for this time of year			0
' even the most keenest of gardeners has struggled to get outside for much of april			0
' the months of april and may should be one of the busiest times of the year in the garden			0
' a lot of seeds and bulbs are planted and people start thinking about bedding plants for their hanging baskets and containers			0
' and they generally go to garden centres to buy not only these items but also compost and fertiliser and pots and baskets			0
' but if they put these plants in the ground over the last week or so they would probably have drowned			0
' a spokesman for the @entity172 in @entity173 , added : ' people are just not gardening			0
' if they plant anything , heavy rain and hail will just ruin the plants			0
being as wet as it has been is causing chaos , people can not get in the garden			0
' they are less inclined to hang baskets			0
it is too expensive to heat greenhouses and almost impossible to care for seedlings			0

fears *escalating* that the entire @entity24 crop valued at £ 20m could be written off
