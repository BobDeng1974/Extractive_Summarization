the shadow chancellor , who was last night forced to welcome @entity8 ’s success in negotiating a lower @entity10 budget in @entity11 , said his party needed to be careful not to become ‘ caricatured ’ as the ‘ pro-status quo ’ party on the issue			1
labour leader mr @entity2 shocked colleagues by appearing to rule out an in / out referendum after the prime minister promised one last month , though aides attempted to undo the damage by saying he had not meant to do so forever			1
do n't be ' stupid ' : shadow chancellor @entity1 ( right ) warned @entity2 ( left ) not to allow @entity3 to be cast as the ' anti-referendum ' party on @entity5 mr @entity1 , who is said to have been pressing for a more robust line on @entity5 for months , told the @entity23 that he was happy with @entity3 ’s position ‘ for now ’			1
‘ as long as we do n’t allow ourselves to be caricatured as an anti-referendum party , which we ’re not - we ’ve absolutely not ruled out a referendum - i personally think that for now this is quite a comfortable position for us , ’ the shadow @entity1 said			1
‘ if we allow ourselves either to be the “ status quo party ” on @entity5 , or the “ anti-referendum party ” on @entity5 , then we ’ve got a problem			1
‘ but i think we would be pretty stupid to allow ourselves to get into either of those positions			2
’ in the @entity34 , mr @entity8 ridiculed @entity3 ’s position - pointing out the party gave up a large chunk of the @entity10 budget rebate won by @entity39 in 1984 , and urging it to persuade socialist allies in the @entity42 to back the new deal			2
the prime minister said he had fended off repeated attacks on what remains of the @entity48 ’s rebate , which he declared ‘ safe ’			1
mr @entity8 told @entity50 the @entity48 had successfully rejected proposals by @entity5 ’s ‘ big spenders ’ for an increase in the budget , as he won the backing of @entity56 , the @entity57 and @entity58 for a reduction in the @entity10 ’s credit card limit			0
back the new deal : @entity8 ridiculed @entity3 's position - pointing out the party gave up a large chunk of the @entity10 budget rebate won by @entity39 in 1984 he told @entity50 it was ‘ disappointing ’ that administrative costs were still six per cent of the total budget , but he was pleased spending on the @entity68 would fall by 13 per cent on the last seven - year budget			2
mr @entity8 launched a strong attract on @entity10 officials who resisted budget cuts , claiming they see themselves as ‘ higher beings who even refer to civil servants elsewhere as burger flippers compared to their lofty role ’			0
he also said the @entity76 should start its meetings in the morning rather than over dinner and into the early hours of the morning			0
last week ’s talks ran through the night and into the next day , taking 26 hours in all			0
sir @entity80 : mr @entity8 had been ' successful at winning the most important reform in the @entity10 budget since @entity39 ' a series of conservative backbenchers , including some of his harshest critics , spoke to praise mr @entity8 ’s budget deal			0
former defence and foreign secretary sir @entity80 said mr @entity8 had been as ‘ successful at winning the most important reform in the @entity10 budget since @entity39 at @entity89 ’			0
@entity91 mp @entity90 , one of the leaders of a @entity94 revolt against the government over the @entity10 budget last year , hailed the deal and said it would save every household £ 150			0
however , the budget still needs to be approved by the @entity42 , where @entity100 have caused outrage by suggesting that they might use a secret ballot to maximise the chances of it being rejected			0
mr @entity8 said it would be a ‘ very serious situation ’ if the @entity42 blocked the deal and condemned the idea of a secret vote			0
he said : ‘ i would encourage every mep from right across the @entity48 , whatever their party , to support this budget because it is better to have a deal than have no deal and this deal is right for @entity5 ’s taxpayers			2
’ a @entity3 source said : ‘ it is ridiculous to suggest there is a difference between @entity2 and @entity1 on @entity5			1
as @entity2 set out in his speech at the @entity125 in november , @entity3 believes our priorities should be to promote growth at home and secure influence abroad			2
‘ both @entity2 and @entity1 believe committing to an in / out referendum at the moment will not help either of these priorities			1
’ a @entity3 spokesman added : ‘ the @entity130 of @entity100 will be voting for the @entity5 budget deal agreed at the @entity76 summit last friday			0

@entity2 shocked colleagues by appearing to rule out an in / out referendum after the prime minister promised one last month
@entity1 said his party need to be careful not to be seen as ' pro-status quo '
