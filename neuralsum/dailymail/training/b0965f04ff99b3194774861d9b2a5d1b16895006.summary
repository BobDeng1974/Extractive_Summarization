by @entity0 last updated at 8:34 am on 28th september 2011 scandals : the @entity2 has flown to the @entity3 with two aides it is two months since a string of scandals forced prince @entity2 officially to step down as the @entity9 ’s global trade ambassador			1
yet it seems little has changed in practice for the royal , dubbed ‘ @entity13 ’ because of his love of luxury air travel			0
just three days after returning from an expensive ‘ trade mission ’ to @entity17 , the @entity2 is on his taxpayer - funded travels again – this time to promote @entity9 business in @entity21			1
he and two aides have flown nearly 7,000 miles to the @entity3 , where he aims to boost ‘ high - level bilateral relations between the @entity9 and @entity21 , in particular in relation to trade and investment ’			1
only last week , @entity2 was accused of wasting public money after spending up to £ 150,000 to charter a private jet to fly him to the @entity31 , where he met @entity17 businessmen and politicians			2
the prince was forced to relinquish his official trade title in july following criticism over his friendship with convicted paedophile @entity39 , as well as claims of boorish behaviour towards foreign dignitaries			0
he then created a new job for himself – as a ‘ senior working royal ’ with a particular interest in @entity9 business – which critics claimed was a ploy to enable him to continue his trips abroad			1
@entity2 flew out to @entity21 on a scheduled flight from @entity51 on monday night and is not due to return to the @entity9 until saturday			1
taxpayers will pick up his travel costs to @entity21 , while @entity54 ( @entity54 ) will pay the bill for his ‘ accommodation and expenses and any in - country travel ’			1
bright lights , big city : taxpayers will pick up his travel costs to @entity21 , while @entity54 will pay for his ' accommodation and expenses ' @entity54 officials at last night defended the trip , pointing out that @entity21 is the @entity9 ’s 19th largest market in terms of @entity9 goods exports			1
but cynics pointed out that with its tropical climate , fantastic array of golf courses and first - class hotels and restaurants , there may be other incentives for making the twelve - and - a - half hour flight			0
records show that prince @entity2 has visited @entity21 every year since at least 2007 , making it one of his most popular destinations			2
the @entity80 said he was accompanied on his latest trip by deputy private secretary @entity82 and an assistant private secretary , @entity84			0
as is custom , it did not mention whether any domestic staff or protection officers were in his entourage			0
going back for more : prince @entity2 shaking hands with the then @entity21 president @entity91 on a previous visit in 2001 @entity93 , former head of @entity96 ’s @entity95 – and one of prince @entity2 ’s fiercest critics – said last night : ‘ trips like these , which involve first - class travel and five - star hotels , as well as the presence of protection officers and various aides , are very expensive			1
‘ there needs to be a proper evaluation of whether they provide value for money			0
i am not convinced they provide any real benefit			0
at a time when people are trying to cut back , prince @entity2 – despite the scandals which have engulfed him – is carrying on as if nothing has changed			2
’ the prince ’s spokesman said : ‘ the visit to @entity21 was agreed before the @entity2 relinquished the role of special representative in july			2
the @entity123 agreed that it should continue and it has been approved by the @entity124			0
