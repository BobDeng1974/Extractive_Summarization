two new houses , which are just four metres deep , are being built on a cramped derelict plot - and could be sold for up to £ 500,000 each			1
the development , on a patch of land 29 metres long , is in upmarket @entity5 , in @entity6 , where space for new property is in short supply			1
the houses - the length of a @entity12 - will have two storeys of living space and two bedrooms , a living room , kitchen area and a bathroom plus storage space			1
this tiny plot of land in upmarket @entity5 , @entity6 , will have two houses built , each just four metres deep the houses , which are as deep as the length of a @entity12 , will feature two storeys of living space each they will also have flat roofs with solar panels - but no rear windows because of the tall retaining wall behind them			1
the total depth of the plot is 4m - compared to the @entity34 - but inside the houses will be even smaller because of the thickness of the outside walls			1
local estate agents say when finished they each could fetch up to £ 425,000			0
@entity39 turned down a previous scheme three years ago because it proposed three houses on the site			2
but planners have now agreed there are no good reasons for turning down the revised plan for two houses @entity47			2
the depth of the plots are four metres , but once built , they will be even narrower because of thick outer walls the site once formed part of a large quarry and there is a steep drop from the back of the existing houses to this plot			2
planning agent @entity61 said despite the narrow width of the site , the homes would provide a similar amount of space to a home with a more conventional design			0
he said : ' if you think of a modern executive house , the depth of the rooms is unlikely to be more than about four metres			0
' instead of having rooms back - to - back in the traditional way , in this case , we have got them side by side			0
' he added that the design meant there was enough space to meet the council 's planning regulations			0
it has not yet been made clear when the homes will be built or when they will become available on the market			0
