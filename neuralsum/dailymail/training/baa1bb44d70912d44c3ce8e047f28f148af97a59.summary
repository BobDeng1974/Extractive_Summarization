by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 12:58 est , 2 december 2013 updated : 13:54 est , 2 december 2013 the @entity3 administration has forcefully denied that it is quietly exploring the possibility of a presidential visit to @entity6 in 2014 , despite weekend news reports that originated with a newspaper in @entity9			2
the @entity10 quickly pooh - poohed the idea late monday morning , with @entity13 spokeswoman @entity12 telling @entity14 in an email that ' there 's no truth to this report			2
' ' i 'll leave it to others to speculate on how rumors get started , ' she said			0
she also declined to speculate on whether the @entity10 might accept an offer to visit @entity25 if the initial news report were a trial balloon to gauge the administration 's likely response			2
' i â€™m not ... going to comment on hypothetical situations , ' @entity12 added			0
@entity6 president @entity31 ( c ) got a hero 's welcome when he returned home from the @entity1 in september , with demonstrators chanting ' @entity36 ' and ' death to @entity38 ' -- and ' thank you @entity31 ' @entity3 's last public statements on @entity6 came during a late - night nov. 23 announcement of the terms of a nuclear deal with the @entity45 republic			1
@entity6 later claimed the @entity10 fabricated some of the details it released @entity13 spokeswoman @entity12 ( @entity49 ) was quick to dismiss any idea of @entity3 visiting @entity6 , which is still trying to shake its image as the state sponsor of a 444 - day hostage crisis in the late 1970s a senior national security staffer who served in a @entity56 administration told @entity14 that it would be an ' intensely foolish ' move for the @entity3 team			1
' the only way he goes to @entity25 is if he does n't plan on coming back , ' said the former @entity10 expert , who requested anonymity			1
' whatever people may think about the current occupant of the @entity10 , i ca n't believe this possibility would ever be on the table			0
' the arabic - language @entity9 newspaper @entity69 reported on friday that @entity3 ' is trying to arrange a visit to @entity25 in the middle of next year			1
' ' the source said his desire for the visit is mutual , ' the report read , according to an @entity78 translation obtained by @entity14 , ' and that both @entity25 and @entity79 expect @entity6 president @entity31 to invite his @entity1 counterpart to visit @entity25 as soon as certain arrangements are concluded			1
' the @entity3 administration 's relationship with @entity6 has evolved in recent weeks , following that nation 's preliminary agreement to trim back some portions of its nuclear program in exchange for a relaxation of economic sanctions			0
the @entity9 news outlet @entity92 cited an unnamed diplomatic source and reported that @entity3 is set to visit @entity6 next year how would he explain it to @entity95 ? @entity3 's frosty relationship with @entity38 prime minister @entity95 could be frayed to the breaking point if the @entity10 were to green - light a friendly visit to @entity25 but while @entity6 foreign minister @entity101 mugged for cameras last month in @entity103 and promised greater transparency , both @entity31 and @entity100 fed @entity6 a steady diet of hard - line rhetoric			1
and @entity6 leaders slammed the @entity3 @entity10 last week for publishing what it termed a ' one - sided interpretation ' of the agreement , later disagreeing with the @entity10 's claim that it would forgo its ' absolute ' right to enrich uranium			0
@entity6 also said last week that its controversial heavy - water reactor project would continue , a sign that it is developing a plutonium reactor most likely intended for producing weapons - grade nuclear material			0
the @entity69 report first surfaced on a blog published by @entity119			0
the confusion over @entity79 's relationship with @entity25 comes as @entity6 has acknowledged that it will build a second nuclear reactor , which it claims is for peaceful purposes			1
the state - run @entity124 reported sunday that a new facility would be built in the same province where it already has a function reactor , which @entity130 helps operate			0
the @entity9 newspaper @entity69 published a report friday , in @entity133 , claiming that president @entity3 was planning a visit to @entity6			1
here is a translation provided to @entity14 by a fluent @entity133 speaker : @entity69 has learned from a @entity1 diplomat that president @entity3 is trying to arrange a visit to @entity25 in the middle of next year			2
the source said his desire for the visit is mutual , and that both @entity25 and @entity79 expect @entity6 president @entity31 to invite his @entity1 counterpart to visit @entity25 as soon as certain arrangements are concluded			1
he [ the source ] pointed out that the most significant detail remaining to be decided is whether there will be a meeting between @entity3 and supreme leader @entity100 , or whether that meeting wo n't be held			2
the source said @entity3 was expecting the invitation , and planned to devote the trip to publicizing his administration 's policy in the region , which is based on the principles of non-military involvement and harmony			0
he wants to be the first @entity1 president to visit @entity6 since the @entity162 revolution , and to demonstrate that he is a champion of peaceful discussions , even with those who chant ' death to @entity1			0

@entity13 spokeswoman *flatly* denies the report that a visit to @entity25 is in the works
' the only way he goes to @entity25 is if he does n't plan on coming back , ' a former @entity10 national security expert told @entity14
the @entity9 newspaper @entity69 claimed on friday that @entity3 was expecting an invitation from @entity6 president @entity31
according to that report , the only remaining *hurdle* was the thorny question of whether @entity3 would visit with supreme leader @entity100
confusion comes as @entity6 announces it plans to build a second nuclear reactor , and *insists* it 's for peaceful purposes only
