by @entity0 published : 11:38 est , 13 april 2012 updated : 15:04 est , 13 april 2012 a top @entity2 public school has become embroiled in a child grooming scandal after 4th grade students became pen - pals with a convicted child molester			1
parents of two children at @entity9 filed a negligence lawsuit alleging that class teacher @entity11 set her students up to write to @entity13 , 55 , who was convicted on march 22 for abusing a girl under 14			1
the suit alleges that the pastor of @entity9 and @entity17 , @entity16 , knew of and approved of @entity19 's pen - pal plan			2
frightening for parents : fifty - five - year old @entity21 received letters for months from children despite being in jail for child sex offences furthermore , it is claimed that @entity13 , who is a friend of @entity19 's family was delivered the letters in jail by @entity19 's father hidden from prison staff in large gift packages			1
another claim in the lawsuit is that @entity19 's husband @entity35 was in contact with his wife 's students as a soccer coach , even though he is charged with possessing child pornography by @entity41 in @entity42			1
letter writing lessons : one of the letters that @entity13 wrote to one of the children at @entity9 in @entity2 while @entity11 no longer works at the school and the principal @entity50 is on administrative leave , questions are being asked as to who knew what and when			2
the lawsuit alleges that the pen - pal project was @entity11 's idea and that she allegedly told students that @entity13 was falsely accused			1
@entity19 ( left ) and @entity11 ( right ) married last year and are both involved in the pen - pal scandal at @entity59 in @entity2 ' the children were told by @entity11 that @entity61 had kidnapped his grandchildren to keep them from harm by parents or others , ' said the suit filed by the two unnamed parents			2
' in reality , @entity13 had been accused of aggravated sexual assault			0
' the project which began before @entity13 's march 22 conviction saw children offer up personal information to him			1
to the top : pastor @entity16 of @entity75 and @entity9 is accused of not acting fast enough to deal with convicted child molester @entity13 writing to nine and ten year old children ' @entity11 had her children , as a project to obtain a grade in the classroom , participate in an open writing campaign with @entity13 by which the children would give their personal information to @entity13 and @entity21 would respond with warm and encouraging letters to the children , allowing @entity13 to establish a rapport with the children and establishing them as potential future victims of his and others , ' claimed the lawsuit heard in @entity2			1
before his conviction it is thought that @entity13 would have been in a position to share the children 's information with other sex offenders			1
' in the @entity101 jail , all persons charged with child or sexual crimes were kept out of the general population , but were segregated together with contact and communications between them , ' continued the parents complaint			0
' the letters from these children , containing full names , ages and locations where the children could be found could , and upon information and belief were , distributed freely			2
' authorities found the letters as they were transferring @entity13 from one cell to another in the county jail on the day of his conviction			2
@entity9 is one of @entity2 's most sought after public schools ' it 's very alarming , ' said @entity101 district attorney @entity124 who first alerted parents at the school to the issue			0
one mother of the dozen or so children who became pen - pals with @entity13 spoke to @entity131 in @entity2 about her shock			2
' i have two little boys who now are very aware of how horrible adults can be , ' said the mother who did not wish to be named			0
' he uses words like , ' whatz up ' with a z. looking at it makes me sick because i feel like it was conditioning all along to develop and endear himself to these children			0
' the pen pal relationship which was established over a period of several months before being discovered is at the heart of the parents legal complaint			0
principal @entity148 of @entity59 has been placed on administrative leave it is claimed that school pastor @entity16 had a lax attitude towards child protection as he had been aware that @entity19 's wife , @entity35 was accused of owning child porn and was working with the children			1
however , @entity156 , chairman of the school 's governing board , said that @entity19 had not been near to the school since his indictment in @entity41			0
the @entity19 's family friendship with @entity13 went as far as @entity162 , @entity11 's father , acting as a character witness in his molestation trial in @entity165			1
legal ramifications : parents of two children who were pen - pals with @entity13 have filed a negligence lawsuit against @entity75 and @entity9 ' @entity9 has allowed , in fact encouraged ... minor children to have contact and communication with a child molester and a person indicted for promotion of child pornography , ' said the suit filed by attorney @entity180			1
' @entity9 has approved and condoned the release of identification of minor children 's information for distribution with the jail and prison systems			1
' countering the claims of negligence , @entity9 was adamant it had done all it could have			0
' we 've hired a private investigator to find out exactly what happened and have enacted new security protocols and policies , ' said @entity156 wednesday			0
' there 's a long history of churches corresponding with inmates			0
' in this case , it was really poorly handled			0
we did n't have good information or know the type of charges pending			0
' the parents of both children have removed them from the @entity2 school following the march revelations			0

@entity11 a 4th grade teacher encouraged her students to write to @entity210 while he was in jail
convicted child sex offender was a friend of @entity19 's family
her father *secretly* delivered the children 's letters to @entity13 while he was in prison
the children were told to write personal information in the letters
it is thought that @entity13 may have shared that information with other sex offenders while in jail
@entity11 's husband has been indicted by police for child pornography charges
