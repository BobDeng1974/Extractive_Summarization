fugitive whistleblower @entity0 has attacked @entity2 's new anti-terror legislation fugitive @entity3 worker @entity0 caused fury last night by attacking @entity2 for introducing emergency legislation to foil terrorist plots			1
his critics said the new surveillance @entity9 was being pushed through @entity10 today largely because of his treachery in leaking @entity2 ’s spy secrets			1
@entity0 , who has become one of the world ’s most wanted men , said the measures to allow the security services and police to monitor the public ’s phone , email and internet records ‘ defied belief ’			1
he is wanted for treason after stealing classified documents from the @entity26			1
the defence contractor , a computer specialist at an intelligence centre in @entity30 , leaked highly damaging revelations of attempts by state spy agencies – including @entity2 ’s @entity34 and @entity35 – to monitor citizens ’ private information			1
after he revealed how intelligence agents had access to data compiled by the likes of @entity42 and @entity43 , some of the internet giants – under pressure from civil liberties groups – became reluctant to co-operate with the government and say they may withhold crucial intelligence			2
@entity50 insisted last week that new snooping laws were urgently needed because @entity0 had compromised the ability of the spy agencies to keep track of dangerous extremists			1
last night , in an interview with the @entity58 newspaper conducted in @entity59 where the 31 - year - old has been granted temporary asylum , @entity0 blasted the government for passing emergency laws in peace time			1
he said : ‘ we do n’t have bombs falling			0
we do n’t have u-boats in the harbour			0
’ he added that the move to introduce anti-terror legislation so quickly mirrored the way the @entity71 brought in the @entity72 in 2007 after the @entity26 lost cooperation from telecom and internet companies			0
‘ the @entity26 could have written this draft , ’ he said			0
‘ they passed it under the same sort of emergency justification			0
they said we would be at risk			0
they said companies will no longer cooperate with us			0
[ they said ] we ’re losing valuable intelligence that puts the nation at risk			0
’ @entity0 also questioned why the @entity88 had introduced new laws following a judgement by the @entity92 courts that declared some existing surveillance measures invalid			1
communications firms are obliged by a 2006 @entity96 directive to store records such as who a person called , where from and when for at least a year			0
but this was ruled unlawful by the @entity102 in april and companies had told the government that , if they did not pass the new law , they would begin destroying crucial phone records			0
@entity0 has become of the world 's most wanted men after he stole classified documents from the @entity26 @entity0 said : ‘ is it really going to be so costly for us to take a few days to debate where the line should be drawn about the authority and what really serves the public interest ? ‘ if these surveillance authorities are so interested , so invasive , the courts are actually saying they violate fundamental rights , do we really want to authorise them on a new , increased and more intrusive scale without any public debate ? ’ he said the @entity2 government had been silent in the year since he had exposed the scale of surveillance by the @entity26 and @entity34			1
@entity0 said : ‘ yet suddenly we ’re told there ’s a brand new @entity126			1
and we do n’t have time to debate it , despite the fact that this was not a priority , this was not an issue that needed to be discussed at all , for an entire year			0
’ the government has justified the legislation amid intelligence fears that @entity136 militants are plotting to blow up a transatlantic airliner having developed a stealth bomb undetectable to airport scanners			2
there are mounting concerns that @entity143 ’s top bomb - maker @entity144 has developed a non-metallic bomb that can be hidden inside human bodies or electronic devices			1
civil liberties groups have cast doubt on @entity122 claims that the @entity126 will not increase the powers of the surveillance agencies			2
but @entity153 mp @entity152 said : ‘ @entity0 and the @entity58 continue with their crackpot conspiracy theories and we should take no lessons from them			2
‘ this will protect our country from paedophiles and technologically savvy terrorists			0
this legislation is proportionate and could n’t come fast enough given the threats our country is under			2
