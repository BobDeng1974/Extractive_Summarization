by @entity0 published : 05:26 est , 19 august 2013 updated : 10:17 est , 19 august 2013 dangerous criminals in top - security jails are being allowed to cook their own food as a reward for good behaviour , it has emerged			1
offenders can purchase food from an approved list with their own money and are then allowed to prepare it to their liking in the prison kitchens			0
the self - catering scheme has been rolled out across many low - security jails to help inmates cope when they are released but sources claim the option is also being offered to dangerous offenders			1
even inmates at high security jails , such as @entity21 in @entity22 where murderer @entity23 is serving his sentence and @entity25 in @entity26 where preacher @entity27 was held , are being offered the perk			1
controversial : @entity25 prison in @entity26 is one of the high - security jails to offer inmates the chance to cook their own food as a reward for good behaviour radical islamists @entity37 ( left ) and @entity27 ( right ) have both been held at @entity25 prison a source told @entity40 : ' this is about providing an extra range of food for the most dangerous and more difficult prisoners - the ones the public would like the least			1
' prisoners , who have to use money from their own allowance which can very between £ 4 and £ 25 a week , can purchase a 1.4kg frozen chicken for £ 3.69 or 370g of pork chops for £ 1.99 , the newspaper reports			0
at @entity21 prison , around a quarter of the 600 inmates are on the self - catering scheme with many more wanting to join			1
other prisons to run the scheme include @entity57 and @entity58 in @entity59 and @entity60 in @entity61			2
the revelation is likely to provoke questions for justice secretary @entity64 who has promised a tough stance on crime			0
@entity21 prison in @entity22 , where murderer @entity23 , pictured , is serving his sentence , is also offering the perk to inmates a @entity72 spokeswoman said the self - catering scheme offered offenders a ' productive way to spend their time ' while helping those due to be released to prepare for an ' independent life after prison '			1
they added that the scheme is also an incentive for prisoners to show good behaviour as the privilege is removed from any prisoner who does not comply with the prison regime			1
a @entity87 spokesperson said : ' we are introducing a tough new regime in our prisons , and we are serious about enforcing it			0
' there are a small number of kitchen facilities that provide prisoners serving long sentences with a productive way to spend their time and assist in their rehabilitation by preparing them for an independent life after prison			1
' prisoners are only able to use kitchens if they have earned the right to do so through good behaviour , they must order items from a controlled list and pay for them from their own earnings			2
in the high security prisons only plastic knives are available			2
' but a little over a month ago , prisoners at @entity25 revealed that @entity114 extremists held at the jail threatened to stab anyone who tried to cook pork in the communal kitchens			2
in a letter to prisoners ' magazine inside @entity123 , one inmate claimed it was ' deemed dangerous , even a threat to your life ' if you attempted to cook the meat			0
' @entity130 ' preacher @entity27 and radical cleric @entity37 have both been held at the prison the inmate wrote : ' the kitchen is usually occupied by 90 per cent @entity134 and we have been told if we cook pork we will be stabbed			0
there have been incidents here where people have been targeted and pressured and bullied into converting to @entity114			0
' @entity141 men are being radicalised in here and one day they may commit acts of terrorism in this country			0
' there seems to be nothing being done here to stop it and people are scared to speak out			0
' those prisoners who are not allowed to use the self - catering option have to pick their meals from a menu which includes a vegetarian option			1
justice secretary @entity64 , pictured on a visit to @entity156 in @entity157 earlier this year , is likely to face questions over the scheme after vowing to take a tough stance on crime			0
