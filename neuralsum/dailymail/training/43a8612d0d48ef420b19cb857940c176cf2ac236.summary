by @entity0 published : 20:12 est , 14 march 2013 updated : 20:13 est , 14 march 2013 while millions of families are squashed into cramped city flats with no outdoor space , the majority are dreaming of living somewhere else , according to a poll published today			0
in an ideal world , they would like to live in a detached @entity9 house in the @entity10 , such as @entity11 or @entity12 , with a large garden , a garage and a walk - in wardrobe			1
around 3,500 homeowners were asked , if money was no object , where they would like to live and the sort of home they would like to own			0
despite having an unlimited budget , most people said they would like only four to five bedrooms although they would theoretically have enough money to buy a castle or a mansion			0
most @entity29 families , if money was no object , would choose a four or five bedroom house in @entity31 , such as this thatched cottage in @entity33 , @entity34 the majority - 66 per cent - said they would like ‘ a large garden as an essential part of their ideal property			1
’ around half would like a ‘ multi-car ’ garage , and a similar number nominated a walk - in wardrobe as ‘ a key feature for their dream home			0
’ and very few people want to live in a city , which suggests that millions living in @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 and other cities are only doing so for their jobs			1
when asked where they would like to live , only 14 per cent of people chose @entity48 , and just five per cent chose a large city or town other than @entity48			1
the most popular choice , selected by one in four people , was to live in a rural village , while a further 22 per cent chose a larger country town			1
as well as the location and the bedrooms , those surveyed said a garden and a walk - in wardrobe were part of their dream home @entity68 said 17 per cent would choose to live on the rural coast and 18 per cent would choose a seaside town			2
the @entity10 was ‘ the clear winner ’ with nearly a third of @entity29 nominating it as their dream location			2
the @entity74 was the least preferred location picked by just 1.3 per cent of people			2
@entity77 [ corr ] , from @entity79 , said : ‘ typical @entity29 reserve and understatement shines through in selecting of their ideal property			1
‘ forget sprawling mansions or flash penthouses , the quintessential @entity85 country house with enough room for a family is what the majority of @entity91 view as their dream home			0
a quiet rural retreat is preferred to city life			0
@entity29 reserve : even given a theoretical unlimited budget , those surveyed still did n't plump for a mansion ‘ with numerous chocolate - box villages spread across the @entity10 , it is little wonder the majority of @entity91 would position their ideal home there			1
’ mr @entity77 said the high price of a home in @entity48 , with some selling for tens of millions of pounds each , jars with the fact that so many people do not want to actually live there			1
he added : ‘ @entity48 is home to some of the most expensive prime properties in the world			2
high - spec townhouses , mansions and apartments attract some of the wealthiest buyers from across the globe			0
‘ but the bright lights of city - life appear less attractive for the majority of @entity91 who see their ideal home in a rural idyll 200 miles away			0
’ @entity48 fared poorly in the survey , with just 14 per cent saying it is their ideal location it comes at a time that the average home in the countryside is already around £ 200,000 , around £ 30,000 more expensive than a home in an urban area , according to the banking giant @entity133			1
with an average full - time salary of £ 26,500 , millions of people can not afford to buy in either the city or the countryside , forcing soaring numbers of people to rent or live with their parents			0
@entity68 is part of @entity142 , a privately held company whose shareholders include @entity145 , a division of the @entity146 .			0
