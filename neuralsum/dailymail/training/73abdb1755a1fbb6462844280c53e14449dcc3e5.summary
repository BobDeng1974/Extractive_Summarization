scientists have shown that we automatically link lighter or fairer colours with female names and qualities and darker shades with more masculine attributes			1
as a consequence , most assume that a waiter carrying two glasses of wine would almost certainly give the red to the man and the white to the woman , say the @entity21 psychologists			1
fairer sex : researchers found we automatically link lighter colours with female names and darker shades with more masculine attributes researcher @entity27 began by showing a group of volunteers a selection of male and female names printed on a grey background			1
some were in white text and others in black			1
the men and women had only three - quarters of a second to decide whether each name was male or female			1
the results , presented at the @entity44 , were clear cut			0
professor @entity27 , of @entity46 , said : ‘ i have never seen such a beautiful result			0
the male names in black were processed significantly faster than those in white			1
‘ and the reverse was true for the female names			1
those in the white typeface were processed much faster			2
it was a very strong effect			0
’ in another experiment , volunteers were shown adjectives before the names flashed up			2
the words ‘ soft ’ , ‘ submissive ’ and ‘ weak ’ sped up the processing of female names , while ‘ assertive ’ , ‘ strong ’ and ‘ weighty ’ aided the sorting of male ones			1
volunteers were also asked to imagine a waiter bringing a couple ’s order to the table			2
eighty per cent said that if he had a glass of red wine and one of white , he would give the red to the man and the white to the woman			0
similarly , most assumed an espresso would have been ordered by the male and a cappuccino by the female			2
professor @entity27 , of @entity46 , said that it seems that both sexes link brighter , lighter colours with women and darker ones with men			0
‘ i can only speculate that there is some notion about purity			0
the myth has always been that virginity and purity is distinctly female , whereas males have a dark , sinister , adventurous side			0
‘ i do n’t know what the origin of that is but the effects are unbelievably strong			0

@entity21 researchers show volunteers names printed on grey background
they *picked* out male names in black much quicker than those in white
reverse true for female names
