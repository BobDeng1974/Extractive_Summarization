by @entity0 published : 11:03 est , 21 march 2012 updated : 11:19 est , 21 march 2012 a ' @entity2 ' tax credit to stop film companies going abroad was unveiled by the chancellor in his budget speech today			1
@entity6 announced the plan - similar to the current film tax credit - after concerns that some of the biggest names in television were taking production overseas for tax incentives			1
@entity15 ' drama @entity16 and the show @entity18 are just two productions that have recently been made overseas instead of in @entity20			1
but mr @entity6 said the new tax credits would help to attract ' top international investors ' to the @entity20 as well as retaining current talent			1
in a personal jibe at @entity39 leader @entity38 - who has been compared to the pasticine figure - mr @entity6 said ' we want to keep @entity2 and @entity2 exactly where they are '			1
speaking to the @entity45 today , he said : ' today i am announcing our intention to introduce similar schemes for the video games , animation and high - end tv production industries			0
@entity6 gives his budget speech in the @entity53 today , with his @entity2 and @entity2 measures getting the biggest cheer of the day ' not only will this help stop premium @entity20 tv programmes like @entity18 being made abroad , it will also attract top international investors like @entity60 and @entity61 to make more of their premium shows in the @entity20			1
' it will support our brilliant video games and animation industries too			0
because , mr deputy speaker , it is the determined policy of this government to keep @entity2 and @entity2 exactly where they are			1
' a spokeswoman for the @entity72 , made up of some of the biggest names in tv production , said the tax measures could ' put an end to the exodus ' of @entity20 drama			2
research carried out by the group estimates that the proposed plan would generate around £ 350 million a year for the @entity20 economy			0
@entity84 , chief executive of @entity85 which makes shows including @entity87 , said : ' the proposed changes in the @entity20 tax laws regarding television would give the @entity20 tv industry a much needed shot in the arm			0
going ? @entity2 and @entity2 creators @entity29 warned they would have to move production overseas because they could no longer compete in @entity20 gone : actors in @entity99 which was produced overseas due in part to the tax incentives ' @entity20 production talent is responsible for some of the best television in the world and at the moment many productions , which could very easily be shot in the @entity20 , are being made abroad and many talented creatives are moving elsewhere			1
' @entity85 are currently shooting two productions in @entity111 - @entity110 and @entity112 - where tax breaks make it possible to make hugely ambitious dramas on a @entity20 tv budget and we have many other large scale projects in development that we would love to be able to make in the @entity20			2
' the proposed changes will also welcome productions from around the world to @entity20 shores and quite apart from the revenue that this will bring to our shores it will also help support the creative community in the @entity20 and help train the next generation of film and tv makers			2
' tax relief : @entity133 , creator of the @entity2 and @entity2 animation series @entity135 , executive vice president business at @entity136 cable network @entity61 , said : ' today 's news on a new tax incentive has turned the @entity20 from one of the most expensive options into a competitive and affordable location			1
we would therefore love to bring more production to the @entity20			0
' mr @entity6 said that @entity144 could be ' @entity146 ’s technology centre ' as he unveiled plans to roll out super fast broadband around the country			2
he added : ' two years ago @entity20 had some of the slowest broadband speeds in @entity146 ; today our plans will deliver some of the fastest - with 90 per cent of the population having access to superfast broadband , and improved mobile phone coverage for rural areas and along key roads across the @entity20			0
' but we should not be complacent by saying it is enough to be the best in @entity146 when countries like @entity162 and @entity163 do even better			0
so today we ’re funding ultra fast broadband and wi - fi in ten of the @entity20 ’s largest cities			0
@entity167 , @entity168 , @entity169 , @entity170 , @entity171 , @entity172 , @entity173 , @entity174 , @entity175 and @entity176			0
now my @entity178 friend for @entity180 asked me to help small cities too - no doubt with his own city in mind .			0
