@entity2 , who is currently on a national tour promoting the paleo lifestyle , has long been a passionate advocate of the diet ' that 's the really troubling thing : the infant is totally at the whim of their parents when it comes to feeding			2
if the wrong decision is made , they may be seriously affected , ' she said			0
further concerns have been raised about the inclusion of runny eggs and added salt in the recipes , which contradicts national health guidelines			0

' the @entity124 is aware of this publication and has concerns about the inadequate nutritional value of some of the recipes , in particular the infant formula , and has been consulting with experts and will continue to investigate this matter , ' the statement said			2
in july last year , the @entity138 of @entity13 ( @entity139 ) criticised the paleo diet , with the association 's chief executive officer @entity141 labelling the @entity23 diet was ' potentially dangerous ' and evidence of its benefits ' just does n't stack up '			0
the @entity23 diet requires people to cut out ' grains , legumes , certain dairy products , conventionally - raised meats , non-organic produce , and genetically modified and processed foods ' , which ms @entity153 says is not practical for many @entity13			0
a disclaimer at the back of the cookbook states that the co-authors ' in good faith ' the recipes will lead to a healthier life , ' relying on the information contained in this publication may not give you the results you desire or may cause negative health consequences			0

@entity2 posted a 2,100 word rant on social media in october last year claiming that the modern @entity13 diet is behind the rise in autism , taking aim at the @entity194 and the @entity195 ( @entity139 ) as he promoted the so - called benefits of the paleo diet			2
his fiery rant , which was motivated by a comment from a dietician on his @entity202 page , challenged the idea of the @entity194 's tick and also questioned some of the beliefs held by the @entity139 - both of which have spoken out against the paleo diet			0
