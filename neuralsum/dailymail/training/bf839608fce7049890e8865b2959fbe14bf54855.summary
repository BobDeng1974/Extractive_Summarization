blundering builders mistakenly bulldozed an 18th - century chateau in the heart of @entity4 's picturesque wine country - when they were only supposed to knock down an outhouse on its estate			0
@entity7 , 12km to the east of @entity9 , once boasted 140,000 - square - feet of grand reception rooms , ornate fireplaces , winding marble staircases and imposing granite balconies			1
then its new owner , a @entity16 millionaire businessman , employed a team of @entity19 builders to renovate the manor to its former baroque glory , including the removal of one small building			1
but the workers apparently misunderstood the instructions and pulled down the castle instead , leaving the outhouse completely untouched			1
no you see it : the @entity7 was considered a local treasure boasting a grand hall that could host some 200 people , as well as a sweeping stone staircase now you do n't : workers who were hired to renovate the grand 140,000 - square - foot manor and raze a small building on the same estate in southwest @entity4 mixed them up ' the @entity7 was @entity42 's pride and joy , ' said former owner @entity44			1
' the whole village is in shock			0
how can this construction firm make such a mistake ? ' local media reported that the construction company misunderstood the renovation plans of the current owner , @entity16 businessman @entity52 , to clean up and renovate the manor			2
@entity52 was away when the calamity occurred and returned home to discover his chateau , a local treasure whose grand hall could host some 200 people , was nothing but rubble			0
' we 're in shock ' : the outhouse that the builders were supposed to destroy is now the only part of the once lavish property still standing piles of rubble : the @entity19 builders misunderstood the instructions to clean up the building and restore it to its former glory task ahead : the castle 's @entity16 millionaire owner @entity52 has vowed to rebuild it stone by stone into an exact replica @entity52 , who works in @entity80 , told the local paper @entity81 : ' i did n't know the chateau had been destroyed , i 'm in shock			2
even if it was in a very bad state , i had wanted to renovate it			0
' he told them he plans to build an exact replica of lost manor on the site .			0
