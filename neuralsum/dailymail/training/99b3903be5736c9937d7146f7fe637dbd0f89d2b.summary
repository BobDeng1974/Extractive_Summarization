by @entity1 reporter published : 19:35 est , 24 july 2013 updated : 03:17 est , 25 july 2013 the @entity2 has been caught on camera as it makes its way to an unexplored mountain on the red planet , leaving weaving set of tracks in its wake			1
the image , which was caught by a @entity12 camera orbiting @entity13 last month and released today by scientists , shows @entity2 making its way across the planet			1
the tracks lead back to a dark , blasted spot on the surface of @entity13			1
the spot called the ' @entity22 ' is where @entity2 first touched down on the planet - and is named after the late sci - fi author @entity25			1
when the picture was taken , the @entity2 was exploring rocks called ' @entity40 ' before heading on a five - mile journey to @entity42 , according to @entity43			1
@entity12 scientists are keen to discover what secrets @entity42 , which is 3.4miles high , holds in its layers about the changing environment on the planet			1
the main focus of the @entity2 is to work out if @entity13 has ever supported life			1
snow on ancient @entity13 is the most likely reason for the network of valleys that exist there , scientists revealed this week			1
recent findings by researchers at @entity58 have shown that some @entity13 valleys appear to have been caused by runoff from orographic precipitation -- moisture carried part of the way up a mountain and deposited on the slopes			1
mission to @entity13 : view from @entity2 's arm - mounted camera after a long drive this week at @entity42 the findings help to answer the question of whether water flowing on ancient @entity13 bubbled up from the ground or fell down from the atmosphere			1
scientists studied four different locations on @entity13 that they suspected had water - carved valleys , caused by snow or rainfall when moist prevailing winds are pushed upward by mountain ridges			1
the new findings , published in @entity83 , are the most detailed evidence yet of an orographic effect on ancient @entity13 and could shed new light on the planet 's early climate and atmosphere			2
researchers at @entity58 have shown that some martian valleys ( pictured ) appear to have been caused by runoff from orographic precipitation -- moisture carried part of the way up a mountain and deposited on the slopes @entity98 , a geological sciences graduate student at @entity58 , led the research and is well - acquainted with the orographic effect			2
she did graduate work in meteorology in @entity102 , which is home to a quintessential orographic pattern			2
moist tropical winds from the east are pushed upward when they hit the mountains of @entity102 's big island			2
the winds lack the kinetic energy to reach the mountain summit , so they dump their moisture on the eastern side of the island , making parts of it a tropical jungle			2
the findings help to answer the question of whether water flowing on ancient @entity13 bubbled up from the ground or fell down from the atmosphere			2
@entity12 's @entity2 ( pictured ) found evidence of ' drinkable ' water in clay minerals in @entity125 , in march the western side , in contrast , is nearly a desert because it sits in a rain shadow cast by the mountain peak			1
ms @entity98 thought similar orographic patterns might have been at play on early @entity13 and that the valley networks might be an indicator			0
' that 's what immediately came to mind in trying to figure out if these valleys on @entity13 are precipitation related , ' she said			0
the scientists started by identifying four @entity13 locations where valley networks were found along tall mountain ridges or raised crater rims			0
to establish the direction of the prevailing winds at each location , the researchers used a newly developed general circulation model ( @entity150 ) for @entity13			0
the model simulated air movement based on the gas composition scientists think was present in the early @entity13 atmosphere			0
the team then used a model of orographic precipitation to determine where , given the prevailing winds from the @entity150 , precipitation would be likely to fall in each of the study areas			0
the new findings , published in @entity83 , are the most detailed evidence yet of an orographic effect on ancient @entity13 and could shed new light on the planet 's early climate and atmosphere			0
a photo of the red planet , taken by the curiosity rover is pictured the simulations showed that precipitation would have been heaviest at the heads of the densest valley networks			1
ms @entity98 said : ' their drainage density varies in the way you would expect from the complex response of precipitation to topography			0
we were able to confirm that in a pretty solid way			0
' the atmospheric parameters used in the @entity150 are based on other models that predict a cold climate on the red planet , so the precipitation modeled in this study was snow			0
however , the researchers said that the snow could have been melted by episodic warming conditions to form the valley networks and therefore it could also have rained on ancient @entity13			0
ms @entity98 said : ' the next step is to do some snowmelt modeling			0
' the question is how fast can you melt a giant snowbank			0
do you need rain ? is it even possible to get enough discharge [ to carve the valleys ] with just the snowmelt ? ' the answers to these questions could provide an insight into the climate on @entity13 billions of years ago .			0
