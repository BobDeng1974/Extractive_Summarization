by @entity0 and @entity1 one in four voters trust @entity4 to run the economy , a survey shows @entity4 ’s economic credibility took another tumble yesterday after his lacklustre response to the @entity9			1
a new survey found that fewer than one in four voters say they trust the @entity12 leader to run the economy			1
mr @entity4 ’s support has dropped 10 points since january to 23 per cent while 21 per cent said the @entity9 had reduced their trust in his ability to manage the economy			1
mr @entity4 polls even worse than his party with 31 per cent of voters backing @entity12 to run @entity20 the telephone survey of 1,600 voters after the @entity9 by public affairs firm @entity21 found that 37 per cent trust the @entity25 and 23 per cent said the @entity9 had increased their trust in @entity26 to manage the economy			1
the data came amid growing disquiet among @entity29 that mr @entity4 and shadow chancellor @entity30 have now botched their response to the @entity9 and @entity34 ’s @entity33 last december			1
there were also signs of tension between the two men yesterday after mr @entity30 said mr @entity4 had a ‘ difficult ’ time because he relied on @entity40 to predict the contents of the @entity9 and revealed that he had spent much of mr @entity34 ’s speech trying to wake up communities secretary @entity43			1
an ally of @entity4 told the @entity45 : ‘ we always knew it was going to be a difficult budget with the economy on the turn			2
it was not made easier by @entity30			0
’ another said ‘ the problem ’ for @entity12 is that ‘ we do n’t have a strong enough economic policy ’ - a barely coded jibe at mr @entity30			2
friends of the shadow chancellor claimed he wanted to go further in contesting the @entity9 but was overruled by mr @entity4 , who used well - worn attacks on mr @entity60 ’s @entity59 background and membership of the @entity63 @entity62 rather than respond to the chancellor ’s announcements in his speech			2
support for mr @entity4 pictured during a visit to the @entity69 , @entity70 , has dropped 10 points since january to 23 per cent while 21 per cent said the @entity9 had reduced their trust in his ability to manage the economy a @entity12 mp summed up mood of frustration about mr @entity4 ’s performance on the backbenches : ‘ the best you can say is that it was better than @entity30 ’ awful speech after the last @entity33			1
i ’ve no idea why he did n’t talk about anything that was actually in the @entity9			0
’ deputy prime minister @entity85 said it seemed as if mr @entity4 had been “ thinking about the football for an hour ” instead of listening to what mr @entity34 was saying			0
former @entity90 minister @entity89 said : ‘ his speech was the worst speech i have ever seen in the @entity92			0
’ ‘ i want to have an intelligent critique of the budget and the state of the public finances , rather than lots of shouting about which clubs at @entity63 he did or did not belong to , and which ones @entity60 did n’t do			0
‘ i think it was demeaning for @entity104 politics			0
it is important for the health of our democracy that we have an official opposition that has an economic policy , and there was no evidence of that yesterday			0
’ @entity26 mp @entity113 added : ‘ the real significance is that you ’ve got a leader of the opposition who wants to run the country but he is pretty vacuous when it comes to economics			0
