dead : brigadier general @entity1 was fatally injured in the blast a senior commander of @entity5 's missile development programme has been killed in an explosion at a military base - prompting speculation that @entity9 was involved			1
brigadier general @entity1 was fatally injured in the blast , which killed 17 people in total , at a @entity14 compound 25 miles east of the capital @entity16			1
@entity5 authorities have claimed the explosion was caused by ' an accident ' when ammunition was being moved			1
but @entity1 's high profile has led to speculation it was an act of sabotage by the @entity25 intelligence service - or even its @entity27 counterpart the @entity28 - which is trying to halt @entity5 's nuclear weapons programme			1
it comes in the same week the son of a former @entity14 commander was found dead in a @entity34 hotel room			0
his father 's website has called the death ' suspicious ' but police have insisted it was not			0
@entity1 was said to be responsible for ' industrial research aimed at ensuring self - sufficiency of the @entity14 ' armaments '			1
commentators on @entity5 believe this is a coded way of saying he was responsible for its missile inventory			1
@entity48 , who regularly reveals information censored inside @entity25 , said on his blog that a source confirmed @entity9 had worked with exile group the @entity53 's @entity52 ( @entity54 ) on the blast			1
he said : ' it is widely known within intelligence circles that the @entity25 use the @entity54 for varied acts of espionage and terror			0
' it is the latest ' disaster ' to hit @entity5 's nuclear programme in the last two years			1
in 2010 , 18 people were killed after an explosion at a base which housed @entity67 long - range missiles			2
it was also put down to a fire in an ammunition depot			0
and a highly sophisticated computer worm which caused centrifuges used for enriching uranium to spin out of control was also blamed on the @entity25			0
the explosion comes as the son of a former @entity14 commander was found dead in a @entity34 hotel room			2
@entity95 reportedly died inside @entity96 ( right ) , a four - star hotel in the coastal @entity99 city , on sunday			0
@entity100 , head of the @entity34 police 's criminal investigations department , said there is no criminal suspicion surrounding the man 's death and that @entity95 suffered from epilepsy			0
but @entity108 , a website owned by the dead man 's father , @entity110 , claimed @entity95 ' was killed under suspicious circumstances '			0
the site noted the death was ' concurrent with the martyrdom of @entity110 's comrades in arms ' on saturday , referring to the @entity14 explosion			2
the semi-official @entity119 reported that @entity95 died from an electric shock			0
his father served as head of @entity5 's powerful @entity14			1
in 2009 , he ran - unsuccessfully - as a conservative candidate along with others against incumbent president @entity125			0
@entity9 , which never claims responsibility for attacks , has been suspected of being involved in all of the incidents			1
but @entity129 , a spokesman for the @entity54 , denied ' absolutely ' that his group was involved and the explosion could be down to the @entity14 , which he said has a reputation for ' sloppiness '			0
@entity14 spokesman gen @entity134 said saturday 's blast also injured a further 16 people , and he denied further claims that the explosion happened as the guard tried to fit a missile with a nuclear warhead			1
he said : ' my colleagues at the guard were transporting ammunition at one of the depots at the site when an explosion occurred as a result of an accident			1
' the explosion comes a week after the release of an @entity155 report renewed calls inside @entity25 for a pre-emptive strike against @entity5 's nuclear facilities			1
it focused partly on efforts allegedly being made to fit such a warhead on a missile , and claimed @entity5 has been working to acquire equipment and weapons design information , testing high explosives and detonators and developing compute models of a warhead ’s core			1
it is also in the same week that @entity27 president @entity172 said that economic sanctions against the country , aimed at halting the @entity5 nuclear threat , were having ' enormous bite '			1
@entity172 , speaking at the @entity178 summit , added that he was united with @entity180 and @entity181 leaders in ensuring @entity5 does not develop an atomic weapon and unleash an arms race across the @entity184			1
he did not specifically say he would consider military action if @entity16 were to persist in arming itself with a nuclear weapon			0
warning : @entity27 president @entity172 ( left ) said he was united with @entity180 and @entity181 in making sure @entity5 , whose president is @entity125 ( right ) does not achieve nuclear weapons but he added : ' we are not taking any options off the table			1
@entity5 with nuclear weapons would pose a threat not only to the region but also to the @entity27			1
' @entity172 's stand came laced with presidential politics			0
@entity199 presidential contenders , including former @entity201 governor @entity200 , have slammed @entity172 for not doing more to keep @entity5 from getting nuclear weaponry			2
@entity5 responding to those criticisms , @entity172 said : ' is this an easy issue ? no. anyone who claims it is is either politicking or does n’t know what they ’re talking about			2
' in meetings on saturday with @entity180 president @entity211 and @entity181 president @entity212 , @entity172 sought to rally support for putting new pressure on @entity5 ’s regime			2
but there was little public sign either country was ready to drop its opposition to additional sanctions through the @entity221			0
@entity172 insisted the countries are working on the next steps			0
he said : ' all three of us entirely agree on the objective which is making sure that @entity5 does not weaponise nuclear power and we do not trigger a nuclear arms race in the region			2
' that ’s in the interest of all of us			0
we will be consulting with them carefully over the next several weeks to look at what other options we have available to us			0
' the @entity27 has already slapped sanctions on dozens of @entity5 government agencies , financial and shipping companies as well as officials over the nuclear program and could target additional institutions like @entity5 ’s @entity241			2
the @entity221 has imposed four rounds of sanctions that have caused economic hardship in @entity5			2
@entity172 added : ' the sanctions have enormous bite and enormous scope			0
