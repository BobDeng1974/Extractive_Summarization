but while she was unhappy with her appearance , she says mother @entity19 told her : ' you are who you are , if you want to change something then change it			2
' and i ca n't lie			2
i thought , " if i just take a couple more of these i might not wake up tomorrow , it will all be done , who cares , " ' she said			1
' i woke up the next day and was like " you actually thought that about yourself			1
you need to sort that "			2

@entity19 said ' you are who you are , if you want to change something then change it ' ' i never thought i 'd be the girl that gets up every day and goes to the gym - i 'd wake up and eat crisps for breakfast ! ' ' there is no secret			1
it 's working out and eating right			0
it 's become a part of my everyday life ' ' i had to learn to love myself			1
' i started to realise i should look after myself a bit better			0
' one pound started to drop , then five pounds , and i thought " this is addicting ! " ' i never thought i 'd be the girl that gets up every day and goes to the gym - i 'd wake up and eat crisps for breakfast ! ' ' it 's not about being skinny , it 's about being healthy			1
