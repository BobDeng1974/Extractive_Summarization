there 's also a large swimming pool , two fire pools , and extensive walled gardens laid to lawn at the house , which is also @entity11 's most expensive , having cost around £ 14million to build			1
when asked about the size of the underground garage , the businessman , who is married to charity worker @entity56 , said : ' my home has a basement area that will house my car collection of sport and vintage models			0
' this is one of my hobbies and the architects were briefed to design a showroom where the cars can be easily displayed and manoeuvred			0

the businessman said he designed the estate based on the idea that ' too much time is wasted in cities sitting in traffic and commuting between home , work , schools and the shops '			0
speaking on his @entity97 website , he said : ' i could have invested in a luxury residence in @entity100 or in the @entity101 , but instead i chose to invest in @entity11			0

original style : the house is surrounded by a circular aqueduct from which water plunges into a man - made lake @entity56 and @entity5 , pictured at their wedding in @entity14 last year , were friends of @entity116 @entity12 will be the centrepiece of his brainchild , the 11,000 - home @entity72 - a luxury ' lifestyle estate ' the @entity79 pad : mr @entity5 bought himself this ten - bedroom house in @entity78 two years ago for £ 62million how the money was made : the success of the meerkat tv adverts meant that mr @entity5 's fortunes doubled ' i also long for the quality of life that we are creating for future residents and it therefore made sense for me to be a part of it ... my wife and i are looking forward to entertaining our friends and business partners from all over the world at our new residence , while also exposing them to our magnificent country			1
' the estate , which at 900 acres will be nearly five times the size of @entity144 , will be 50per cent developed and 50per cent woodland , with pedestrian walkways and cycle and running tracks looping through and around it			0
mr @entity5 is said to be passionate about the idea that the car ruins environments for people - instead he wants children in @entity72 to grow up playing outside without danger of being run over			2
there is also a @entity159 18 - hole championship golf course being built on the estate , with completion scheduled for next year , when the homes in @entity72 will first go on the market			0

the @entity11 insurance boss owes much of his success and wealth to the fictional chief meerkat , @entity34 , who spoke in a fake @entity197 accent and made his ' @entity34 ' catchphrase a national phenomenon			2
worth £ 200million when the meerkat adverts first hit @entity202 screens in 2009 , his wealth has since more than doubled - impressive for an insurance firm started in @entity27 in 1992			1
