students from the @entity7 dressed down for the shoot , which sold 1,500 copies , and raised thousands of pounds for @entity10			2
the 17 members of the group posed naked in their boat house and in action the @entity15 before posting the pictures on both @entity3 and @entity17			1
but the girls have been left devastated after @entity3 removed their page ‘ @entity40 ’s women ’s @entity39 ’ for its ‘ explicitly sexual content ’			1
the rowers were told they were breaching the social media sites ’ ‘ nudity and pornography ’ policy			0
organiser @entity47 , 20 , has blasted @entity3 ’s decision for harming their chances of raising more money for charity with their 2015 calendar , due to be released later this year			1
the history and politics student , who has just finished her second year , said : ‘ @entity3 can unpublish pages after it gives you a warning to make amendments			2
‘ that happened to us a couple of times over the last year where they would ask us to remove certain pictures randomly because they breached their nudity and porn regulations			0
organiser @entity47 , 20 , has blasted @entity3 's decision for harming their chances of raising more money miss @entity47 believes @entity3 's decision is ' borderline sexism ' as the male group is allowed to keep its page the group has already shot its 2015 calendar , which is due to be released in october this year the rowers have sent countless emails to @entity3 in a bid to try and get their page back up and running ‘ we always made the amendments and took the pictures down - even though they were no racier than the others - but a few days ago they emailed and said the page was being completely removed			1
‘ they say it is because of nudity but we are not violating any of their terms and all the pictures we post are not indecent images or inappropriate			0
‘ it is awful for us because we had over 2,000 likes which provides us with a large platform for reaching out to our target market			0
‘ we are students so we do n’t have a marketing budget so we do use social media as the main way of marketing it			0
‘ to have this page unfairly taken away is going to affect our sales for the 2015 calendar and decrease the amount we can make for charity			2
‘ there are loads of similar nude charity calendars who have @entity3 pages plastered across the site - why are n’t they being asked to takes theirs down too			2
’ @entity112 , 22 , who also organised the calendar , said the photos are ' tasteful ' and not ' pornographic ' in an email sent to the rowers , @entity3 told them their site had been removed for ‘ violating ’ its terms of use			2
it said : ‘ continued misuse of @entity3 ’s features could result in the permanent loss of your account			0
’ the group has sent countless emails to the @entity131 site in order to try and explain their situation but have yet to receive a response			0
but @entity47 , who is originally from @entity135 , @entity136 , added : ‘ it is a charity calendar - how can it be porn ? ‘ the @entity3 account for the male rower ’s charity calendar has n’t been deleted and their page is the same as ours			1
the 17 members of the group posed naked next to the @entity15 and their boat house in @entity149 the page - ' @entity40 's women 's @entity39 ' - had over 2,000 likes before it was taken down ‘ we do n’t think they have a right to take it down			1
we ’ve tried to get in contact with @entity3 and sent emails but have got no response			0
’ the rowers raised £ 600 for @entity10 with their first calendar in 2013 which caused controversy when it was branded as ‘ tacky ’ for portraying women as ‘ sex objects ’			1
