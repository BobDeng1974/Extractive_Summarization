by @entity0 published : 06:12 est , 20 june 2012 updated : 08:30 est , 20 june 2012 travelling down a rural canal , the last thing you would expect to see is a @entity4 perched halfway up a tree			2
but that is exactly the bizarre sight that is greeting passers - by on the @entity9 in @entity10 , @entity11			1
after their initial shock , most shrug it off as a work of modern art. but it was only placed there thanks to a spur - of - the - moment decision by a car enthusiast who owns the land the royal oak tree is on			1
bizarre sight : a @entity4 sits on branches halfway up a royal oak next to the @entity9 in @entity10 , @entity11 @entity27 , 54 , had removed the @entity4 's engine and placed it in a classic car he races			1
but he was then unsure what to do with the car 's white fibreglass shell so decided to dump it up the tree			1
with the help of three friends , he first attempted to haul it up the oak using a piece of rope and a sit - on lawnmower			1
but when the lawnmower proved not powerful enough , they tied the @entity4 to a @entity44 and used that to hoist it onto the branches			0
mr @entity27 said : ' i race classic cars and we needed the engine out of the @entity4 for another car			1
' i was left with the fibreglass shell and thought what am i going to do with it ? i did n't want it rusting in the driveway			0
' so it was a spur of the moment decision to put it in the tree			1
my friends thought i was mad but they still agreed to help			0
car enthusiast : @entity27 , who owns the land the tree is on , made a spur - of - the - moment decision to place the car up the royal oak mr @entity27 ( pictured ) had removed the @entity4 's engine and placed it in a classic car that he races			1
he was then unsure what to do with the car 's white fibreglass shell so decided to dump it up the tree ' we tried a lawnmower at first to hoist it up with some ropes and the four of us pulling it but it obviously was n't going to work			2
' but we got it up there eventually using a @entity44			0
it took about an hour - and - a - half			2
we were shattered by the end of it but it was completely worth it			0
' i have had lots of people asking is it trying to be modern art but it 's really not			0
' i really just put it up there for the hell of it			0
it 's really only people on the canal who see it and you hear the odd comment of " what on earth is that doing there ? " ' boat user @entity104 , 28 , from @entity105 spotted the car while heading down the canal last month			0
with the help of three friends , mr @entity27 first attempted to haul it up the oak using a piece of rope and a sit - on lawnmower - but the car proved too heavy she said : ' i saw it and thought that 's really strange , surely it 's someone trying to say something			1
' judging by where it is and how it looks i thought it looked like it was put there as some sort of statement			0
' in april , a boy racer had his prized car hoisted to the top of a tree by his neighbours after they complained it caused them too much noise			2
@entity134 , 24 , woke up to find his souped - up @entity135 dangling from a huge willow in @entity137 , @entity138 .			0
