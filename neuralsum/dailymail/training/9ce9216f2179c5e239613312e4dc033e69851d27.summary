' the badger managed to tear off the entire bottom of @entity7 ’s face and he was left with wounds right up to his eyes			1
ms @entity21 said : ' none of us at this centre have ever seen this kind of cruelty happen to an animal before			0
' @entity7 , who was injured in @entity52 , has been a resident at the shelter since last november			2
ms @entity21 said : ' when his wound started to break down , the owners figured out they could n’t fix his face after all and just cruelly dumped him outside a vets			2
' @entity7 came to us with no collar and no paperwork documenting the past owners , so we have n’t been able to bring them to justice for such a horrific crime			2
' what the owners did was illegal and it ’s hard to describe the pain @entity7 will have been put under			1

' it ’s such a shame as he ’s very affectionate with people and walks well on a lead like any other dog			0
' someone with experience in handling this breed would be helpful as the expertise would be invaluable			0
needs a home : @entity7 is recovering from his ordeal and hopes a new owner will come forward ' one man who helps trains @entity107 to calm their behaviour said to me that the more the badger fights back , the more the dog is urged to go and attack			1
