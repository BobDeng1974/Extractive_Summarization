by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 18:50 est , 25 december 2012 updated : 18:50 est , 25 december 2012 must change : more foreign prisoners should be sent home to serve their time says justice secretary @entity6 @entity7 was hit by a fresh foreign prisoner fiasco last night after it was revealed that a much - trumpeted @entity10 transfer agreement has spectacularly backfired			1
ministers had pinned their hopes on the deal between member states leading to a dramatic fall in overseas inmates clogging the @entity7 ’s jails			2
it allows @entity10 prisoners to be forced to serve their sentence at home			1
but farcically , the two countries with the most inmates in @entity7 – @entity24 and @entity25 – were given opt - outs by the previous @entity27 government			1
as a result , not a single prisoner from a fellow @entity10 country has been sent back to their homeland by the @entity7 since the agreement came into force in december 2011			1
at the same time , @entity7 has been sent two inmates by our @entity10 partners – meaning the number behind bars is going up			1
to make matters worse , a further 38 @entity7 citizens were sent to our packed jails by our @entity10 neighbours under pre-existing voluntary transfer deals			1
only 32 @entity7 went in the opposite direction , according to figures released by prisons minister @entity47			0
at the heart of the fiasco is a decision made by @entity27 three years ago , to grant @entity24 an effective opt - out from the new @entity10 arrangement			1
there are more @entity24 – 861 – in the @entity7 ’s prisons than citizens of any other @entity10 nation			1
it has echoes of @entity27 ’s infamous decision not to place any restrictions on @entity24 when the country joined the @entity62 in 2004			2
it led to one million travelling here from the former @entity66 country , compared to government estimates of 13,000			0
@entity24 ’s exemption from the deal lasts for five years , leaving little prospect of any improvement until 2017 at the earliest			0
ministers in the last government also allowed @entity25 an opt - out , formalising a long - standing arrangement between the two countries			1
no fair : no @entity10 citizen has been sent from @entity7 to serve their jail - time in their native country whilst 38 @entity7 citizens have been returned to be imprisoned here ( file photo ) the news is likely to cast new doubt on how much benefit @entity7 receives from signing up to @entity10 directives			1
justice secretary @entity6 told the @entity88 : ‘ this is an aspect of our prison system that has to change			0
more foreign prisoners must serve their sentences in their own countries			2
there are far too many in our prisons			0
‘ prisoners are being transferred out of our prisons under various transfer agreements but i am determined to do more and will investigate every possible avenue to reduce their numbers and unburden @entity7 taxpayers			2
’ the prime minister had personally put the agreement at the heart of his blueprint for cutting the 11,000 foreign nationals behind bars , which costs taxpayers an estimated £ 420million a year			0
@entity7 prisons contain inmates from 156 different countries			1
there are 193 member countries in the @entity115 , meaning all bar 37 are represented in the @entity7 prison system			2
@entity27 ’s strategy was to offer inmates a bribe of thousands of pounds to go home voluntarily to complete their sentence			2
however in recent years the strategy has shifted towards trumpeting the introduction of the @entity10 prisoner transfer agreement			0
prisoners do not have to give their consent before they can be sent to a fellow member of the @entity10			0
in reply to a question from @entity132 mp @entity131 , mr @entity47 admitted : ‘ to date no prisoners have been transferred from @entity134 and @entity135 to other @entity10 member states under the @entity10 prisoner transfer agreement			0
‘ a small number of requests for transfer to other member states have been made and decisions are awaited			0
’ he added : ‘ it remains government policy that , wherever possible , prisoners should serve their sentences in their own country			1
‘ all of those prisoners from member states which have implemented the @entity10 prisoner transfer agreement , and who it is considered may be eligible for transfer			0
will be transferred at the earliest possible opportunity			0

since december 2011 prisoners from within the @entity10 can be forced to serve their sentence in their home country
previous government allowed opt outs for @entity24 and @entity25 , the two countries with the most inmates serving time in @entity7
meanwhile 38 prisoners were returned to the @entity7
