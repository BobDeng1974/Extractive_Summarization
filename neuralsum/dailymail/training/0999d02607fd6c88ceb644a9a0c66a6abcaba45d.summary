there will be some @entity2 supporters that take the view that no @entity4 should ever captain this famous club			1
let alone one , in @entity7 , that has twice agitated for a transfer in the past four years			1
this particular @entity10 has , however , now spent ten years with @entity2 , happens to be the club 's 3rd highest goalscorer and is also likely to break sir @entity14 's all - time record of 249 goals in the coming seasons			2
@entity7 is the pragmatic selection for @entity18 at a time when this football club is not blessed with true leaders			0
@entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25 have all vacated the dressing - room this summer and @entity2 have lost over 2,000 appearances worth of experience in just a few months from the squad 's playing - staff			1
following the mass exodus of the veterans this summer and a host of first - team players - @entity66 and @entity67 in particular - unavailable , this was always going to be a tricky afternoon for @entity36			0
on saturday lunchtime against @entity42 , with so many young or fringe players in the side , the onus was on the newly - appointed captain @entity7 to step forward			1
@entity7 has always been vocal on the pitch , urging his defence up the field and demanding more from those around him			0
such burning ambition will only intensify with the armband			0
in the first - half , as @entity2 curiously toiled without purpose in @entity18 's favoured 3 - 5 - 2 system , @entity7 struggled to influence the game , unable to find space either deep or in the final third			1
it did not help his case that those around him - principally @entity48 and @entity87 - were so ineffective , barely peeping out of a cloak on anonymity			0
leading the way : @entity7 looked the part sporting the armband during the pre match pleasantries setting an example : @entity7 jumps out of @entity97 's way as he attempts a challenge on the striker jumping for joy : the @entity54 crowd were delighted with the @entity104 striker 's equaliser inspiring the @entity105 : @entity7 led by example on his first appearance as full - time @entity2 captain suits you : @entity7 does n't hide his delight after scoring to cap his first game as @entity2 skipper video @entity2 post-match reaction the change to 4 - 4 - 1 - 1 in the second half afforded @entity7 greater room and he was central to @entity2 's efforts , acrobatically turning home a @entity48 corner and linking intricately with @entity124 as @entity18 's team sought to overturn the 1 - 0 deficit			1
just a few moments before @entity42 retook the lead through @entity129 , a @entity7 free - kick curled around the wall and clipped the outside of the post			2
that , sadly , was his last contribution of note			0
on this frustrating afternoon , @entity7 's most eye - catching work was of perspiration , rather than inspiration			0
as the clock ticked down and @entity2 surrendered timidly , @entity7 tried to motion his team forward			2
ultimately , the quality just was not there and that , sadly , is a damning indictment of the situation @entity18 has inherited at @entity2			0
dejection : @entity7 and his vice-captain @entity148 reflect on what has gone wrong after going behind pushing hard : @entity7 's goal was n't enough for @entity2 even as he tried to make up the deficit			1

@entity7 wore the armband in @entity36 's first game against @entity42
he scored @entity2 's equaliser with an *aerobatic* effort at a corner
some @entity2 supporters have opposed making @entity7 captain *due* to his roots in @entity166 and his transfer *requests* in the past
@entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25 , @entity2 's most *natural* leaders , all left @entity54 during the summer
