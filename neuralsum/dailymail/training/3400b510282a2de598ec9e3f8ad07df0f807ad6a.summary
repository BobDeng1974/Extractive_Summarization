famed artist , scientist , and engineer @entity2 created a beeswax sculpture of a man riding a horse in 1508 , thought to be a model for a larger commission			1
but the @entity9 master died before the model could be cast in metal , and mysteriously vanished from public sight for centuries			1
but after painstaking search , the casting was recovered , and a bronze sculpture of the horse and rider was finally unveiled			1
mastery : the first bronze casting of @entity2 's original @entity20 wax sculpture was unveiled in @entity21 ; it took three years to produce the original beeswax sculpture , as well as the carefully constructed cast , were put on display in @entity26 in an exhibition called ‘ @entity33 ’ after their unveiling at the @entity30 in @entity31 , @entity32			1

according to @entity46 , the sculpture was kept safe in the @entity44 family until the 1930s , when @entity48 came to @entity49			1
the family then moved it to @entity51 for safekeeping			1
@entity52 was known about the sculpture ’s whereabouts until the 1980s , when a group of roving businessmen made it their mission to track it down			2
casting call : the new mould was taken from @entity2 's beeswax sculpture businessman @entity63 purchased the statue in 1985 , but was unsure of his purchase until he spoke with dr @entity66 , an expert on the artist and professor emeritus of art history at the @entity70 – @entity21			1
renaissance man : this sculpture is the only surviving work of the legendary @entity49 artist after meticulously studying the relic , dr @entity66 confirmed that it was indeed authentic			2
