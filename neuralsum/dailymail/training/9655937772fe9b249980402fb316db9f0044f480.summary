in march , @entity124 - based @entity123 launched a @entity111 campaign asking for funding for a @entity109 , pictured			0
it is a first - person game that lets players ' do bear things ' , including exploring , eating fish and plants and sleeping			1
the campaign hit its target funding within a week recreation therapist @entity134 said benefits of playing simulators include stronger reading skills , mathematics , creative thinking , cooperative play , and other creative skills			0
he continued : ' there are very few social table - top recreation activities available that are cooperative rather than competitive in nature			0
' role - playing gaming is , by design , a cooperative past time , which in and of itself may have significant benefits in the world where everything is becoming competitive at all ages and levels of society			0
' however , players can also become too involved in the game , and invest too much time emotionally to a character to the detriment of real relationships			0
this can lead someone to feel isolated , or develop existing negative feelings such as low self - esteem .			0
