what should have been the holiday of a lifetime soon turned into a personal hell as a serious leg infection while visiting @entity5 turned @entity7 's world upside down			1
@entity7 , 25 , a network engineer from @entity8 , had gone for a two - week holiday in @entity5			1
but after spending five enjoyable days in @entity10 , an accident on his first day in @entity13 island , on christmas day , gave him an unwanted present			1
he had gone out with a group of people from a nearby hostel , and when they stopped at a beach he decided to go for a run			2
it was a decision he would live to regret			0
@entity7 could still manage a smile despite a dislocated right finger and an infected left leg ' i tripped and cut my left ankle on some metal			1
there were some superficial cuts on my leg and then a deep one , but it was n't a big deal , ' @entity7 explained			1
' afterwards i went to a clinic and they sent me to a hospital to get treatment			2
i came back from the hospital with it bandaged up			2
they gave me some meds and i was told to keep the wound clean every day , so no problems			2
' in the fall @entity7 had also dislocated his finger which was now in a splint and it seemed this was going to cause more bother than his leg , however , things soon took a turn for the worse			1
things did n't look to bad at first but the infection in @entity7 's leg just refused to go away ' two days later my leg got really swollen			1
my friends got concerned about it and told me to go to the @entity54 - i ended up staying there for two weeks , ' @entity7 said			1
' i did n't feel sick or anything			0
but when i went back to the hospital , they opened up the wound to have a look and it was all black inside			2
' over the next fortnight @entity7 had five procedures on his leg in @entity5 including a series of debridements , where they took away the infected tissue			1
even when he arrived back to @entity67 on january 11 he was n't out of the woods			0
he had to have two more surgery procedures at @entity70 in @entity8			0
this included a skin graft because so much infected skin had to be cut out			0
despite a number of surgical procedures the infection kept coming back again and again ' unfortunately , even after surgery in @entity5 , it was still infected			2
so they had to do two more surgeries a in @entity8			0
i was there for a week and a half , ' he said			0
@entity7 can look back now and talk calmly about what he 's been through , but at the time it was a very different story			1
' the most scary thing was that they told me in hospital in @entity5 that they 'd only have to cut out all the infected area and i 'd be fine			0
but every time they did that when they 'd check my leg the next day there would still be infection there			1
' at one stage i did think ' am i going to lose my leg or something ? ' the thought did cross my mind			2
but you have to stay positive			0
' after five days in @entity10 @entity7 's holiday was going well until he got a @entity108 present he 'll never forget ' but it was worrying because it as like it was an invincible bacteria and just kept coming back			1
at that point when it kept coming back it was a pretty scary period			0
something very minor just got out of control			0
' fortunately @entity7 is nearly back to full health but still has to have his leg checked regularly			1
' these checks are just precautionary , ' he said			0
' it wo n't put me off travelling			0
' and the one other crucial thing he learned about the whole experience - if you go on holidays always have travel insurance .			0

@entity7 fell while out for a run on his first day in @entity13 island
the 25 - year - old only had some superficial cuts on his left leg at first
two days later his leg had swollen up badly and he had to go to hospital
he stayed here for the two weeks as *doctors* tried to fight the infection
@entity7 thought it was an ' invincible bacteria ' that would claim his leg
now he is nearly fully *recovered* but still needs regular check - ups
