a natural reaction for a mother is to want to alleviate their child 's pain but just two doses of a mainstream painkiller saw a seven month old baby almost lose her short life			1
@entity9 , from @entity10 , about 120km west of @entity11 in @entity12 , is no stranger to motherhood , having had six children in 13 years			1
however , nothing could have prepared her for the emotions she experienced over her youngest child in the past few weeks			2
what started out at as a head cold quickly left doctors completely baffled as precious little @entity21 rapidly deteriorated with her skin burning , swelling and blistering so much that she became unidentifiable to her mother			1
' ms @entity9 , a whole food chef who blogs on health and wellbeing , gave chasely two doses of @entity28 on tuesday february 26 as she was miserable after battling the head cold for the past week			1
this was the first time that the seven - month - old had ever taken any medication before but ms @entity9 thought nothing of it as all of her other five children had taken @entity28 in the past			1
' she seemed a bit better after the first dose and seemed a bit more content but after the second dose she was very cranky and irritable , ' she told @entity56			2
' not what you would expect from a child who has just been given pain relief			2
' ms @entity9 immediately had a gut feeling that her little girl has reacted to the medication and read the back of the bottle for potential side effects			1
' i remember scouring the @entity28 bottle for a list of symptoms that might signal an allergic reaction , but could n't find much at all , ' she said			1
' if i can tell you one thing that has become solidified from this whole experience it is trusting your mama gut			0
' the nasty blister on her ear ( left ) and her precious skin shedding off all over her body ( right ) the seven - month old became unidentifiable to her own mother who was told by doctors to expect the worst @entity85 needed to be given the powerful painkiller @entity86 to ease her excruciating pain after a very restless night with her unhappy little one - ms @entity9 knew they had to go to the hospital			1
' she was waking up every 15 minutes squealing in pain , fists clenched , balling over and clamping down every time i would try to feed her , ' ' by the time we got to the emergency room she had a red ring around her eyes , nose and mouth , her neck also was red and had what i thought was bad nappy rash			0
' after several tests including an ultrasound they were sent home with a diagnosis of a viral infection			0
but the next morning , @entity21 had several nasty blisters on her face and neck , and a very painful one on her ear which was weeping , her nappy rash had become even worse and she had become pale and very ill. they went back to the hospital , where anxieties were even further heightened when the doctors had no idea what was wrong with poor @entity21			2
' the day in emergency was quite scary , i remember reading the faces of the staff and seeing worry , but more than anything seeing confusion , ' she said			0
' a kind of look that they had no idea what was going on with my baby girl			0
' ' i hugged her , i whispered in her ear that i needed her to fight on , ' ms @entity9 said to her sick little girl finally a specialist paediatric doctor suggested it may have been an extremely rare condition called @entity138 ’s syndrome - a potentially deadly skin disease that usually results from a drug reaction			1
' doctors came from all around that afternoon to see @entity21 and her skin , it terrified me that all these doctors had never seen anything like it before , ' she said			2
' i mean how could they fix her if they did n't even know what it was ? ' @entity21 was treated with a high dose antibiotics and @entity152 for her excruciating pain			0
' through thursday night she was checked almost hourly , her entire skin was red and hot , she was in such agony and squealed in so much pain			2
' she would n't sleep away from my arms and even the slightest movement could hurt her			0
' when ms @entity9 woke on friday morning , she said she could n't even recognise her own baby			1
' a doctor told me to prepare for the worst , that my baby girl was extremely sick and extremely fragile			2
' my heart completely shattered - i thought we would lose her			0
' it was at this point that ms @entity9 broke down unable to comprehend a life without her beautiful little girl			1
' once i got baby @entity21 to sleep , i escaped to the bathroom and sobbed , ' she said			0
' i did n't know how to fix this , what do i do next ? i could only give myself over to the hospital , and to a higher power			0
' but ms @entity9 decided they were not giving up without a fight			1
' i returned and i hugged her , i whispered in her ear that i needed her to fight on , just fight this off and we will go home			0
i gave her all my energy and all my love , ' she said			0
ms @entity9 cried when she saw @entity21 catch a glimpse of herself in the mirror and start laughing by monday @entity21 's fluid infusions were removed and she was becoming increasingly more like herself numbing gel was used in @entity21 's mouth so she could continue feeding and breast milk was used on her wounds along with lukewarm baths with paraffin and later with paw paw			1
the pain was so bad that she had to be given @entity86 which ms @entity9 said was extremely frightening as it 's such a heavy duty pain killer but knew she had no choice			1
finally , by saturday afternoon , @entity21 started to improve - she was able lay on a bed and look around			0
' my sister and eldest daughter came to visit and danced for her with toys , and though she could n't smile and laugh i could see she was amused , ' she said			0
the following day , her swelling started to go down and parts of her body that had blistered first started to heal and ms @entity9 began to recognise her little girl again			1
by monday her fluid infusions were removed and she was becoming increasingly more like herself			0
' i cried when i saw her catch a glimpse of herself in the mirror and start laughing			0
' @entity21 was released from hospital on tuesday where her skin could be treated at home			2
almost two weeks on from the traumatic experience that almost robbed @entity21 of her young life , you would never know anything was wrong with the miraculous little girl			0
' we are absolutely blessed - it puts everything into perspective and everything else just drops away - nothing else in the world matters			0
' almost two weeks on from the traumatic experience that almost robbed @entity21 of her young life , you would never know anything was wrong with the miraculous little girl she does n't know how she could have gone on if @entity21 did n't courageously bounce back from such a debilitating state			0
' i 'm not sure i would have coped very well - i ca n't imagine going through what some parents have , ' she said			0
chasely must now avoid all steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and ms @entity9 says that they still have a long journey ahead to learn more about her daughter 's condition			1
but she insists she feels no animosity towards @entity28			2
' i 'm not waging a war on pharmaceutical companies - i just want to educate and empower people on what can happen , ' she said			2
' but there is a list of 300 different medications , antibiotics and even vitamins that she can never have so there a lot more to learn on our journey			0
