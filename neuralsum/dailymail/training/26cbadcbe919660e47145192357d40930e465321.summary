by @entity0 the traditional dimpled glass pint tankard is usually associated with old men wearing flat caps – but the chunky - handled beer jug is now proving a big pull among pub - going hipsters			1
in the early 2000s it seemed that the handled pint jug – which first appeared in pubs in the late 1920s - was on the road to extinction			1
the last @entity15 factory to make the handled beer jug , @entity17 in @entity18 , closed down in 2001 , pub landlords found straight pint glasses easy to stack in dishwashers – and beer drinkers preferred them , too			1
but a beer jug revival is now underway thanks to trendy drinkers and city hotspots embracing them – and @entity27 the @entity26 toasting his audiences with them			1
cheers ! @entity27 the @entity26 with a traditional dimpled pint jug the @entity32 in @entity33 , east @entity34 , a popular haunt with hipster - types , has been serving dimpled jugs for the past six months			1
it offers straight glasses , too , but it ’s the jugs that the customers prefer			0
general manager @entity42 told @entity43 : ' the new love of dimpled pint glasses is part and parcel of the revival of the traditional idea of living			1
people are more aware of what they 're putting in their bodies			2
it 's all about being kind to yourself and being aware of your heritage and part and parcel of that is a return to craft beer			0
' people are n't drinking less , but drinking better quality products			0
' dimpled mugs have been served in @entity65 ’ @entity66 since 2000 , with director @entity67 revealing that his mainly artistic clientele love the ‘ old - school coolness ’ of a dimpled tankard , according to the @entity71			2
pint jug revival : the @entity32 in east @entity34 has seen its hipster clientele embrace handled pint pots cask in hand : @entity79 hipster @entity77 enjoys a beer in a handled pint jug keeping a handle on things : @entity79 general manager @entity42 top choice : straight pint glasses are the most popular type with drinkers , but hipsters are embracing dimpled tankards traditional designs : the 10 - sided beer jug arrived in 1928 , left , while the dimpled handled pint pot , pictured right , arrived in 1948 evolution : straight glasses were very popular in the early 20th century and then in the 1960s , but their rims would often nick when they touched , so the nonic glass , right , was brought in to stop this happening pint glasses were straight from the beginning of the 20th century up until around 1928 , when the 10 - sided handled glass pint mug appeared in pubs			1
in 1948 the dimpled pint jug design arrived , which proved more popular than its 10 - sided cousin			1
according to beer blogger @entity105 , this new trend coincided with lighter coloured beers being embraced			0
he said : ' the arrival of the dimple coincided with the triumph of bitter over ( dark ) mild , and amber beers look better in dimpled glasses than in straight - sides ones : the light shining through a pint of bitter in a dimpled glass is the beery equivalent of the windows of @entity120 or @entity121			1
' straight pint glasses became all the rage in the 1960s , but their rims easily chipped when they touched , so the ' nonik ' - or ' no nick ' - glass was invented , which has a bulge in the middle			2
this meant the glasses touched at a sturdier point and so did n't have to be replaced so often			0
@entity132 , narrow glasses are in vogue these days - often emblazoned with the logo of a beer brand			0
source : @entity139 's @entity138 now and then he added : ‘ they are solid and reassuringly comforting			0
’ @entity142 , spokesperson for the @entity143 , said that some pubs use traditional pint pots to help drinkers distinguish between brands			2
he told @entity43 : ‘ it 's fantastic to see dimpled pint glasses making something of a comeback as real ale continues to grow in popularity , particularly in venues which might not have previously served cask beer			1
‘ @entity15 is in the middle of a real ale revolution			2
with well over a thousand breweries now producing real ale , your local pub is now much more likely to be serving a locally produced brew			0
' many pubs which are expanding their beer range are using these traditional pint pots to differentiate their cask beers from mainstream lager brands , something which can only be good for @entity15 beer drinkers			1
’ the @entity26 , meanwhile , is also toasting the dimpled pint jug 's return			1
he said : ' the return of these glasses is a triumph			0
each one looks like a precious cut diamond but contains something better than 24 carats : one pint			2
for the first time in my life i salute the young and trendy			0
though they should all bloody shave			0
' recent research shows that craft beer is n't just proving evermore popular in trendy pubs , but is catching wine as the drink of choice to take to dinner parties			0
over half of @entity191 say they already prefer to take beer , not wine to dinner parties , or plan to make the switch soon , according to a new nationwide poll , by online marketplace @entity198			0
the site found that the trend is most pronounced among under 35s , who are 20 per cent more likely to drink craft beer over wine at social occasions than older generations			0
a number of factors are driving the shift in attitudes , the research showed , with 60 per cent of respondents saying they see craft beers as the ideal way to explore new exciting flavours with friends and almost half believe craft beer sparks more interesting conversation than wine			0
the handled pint pot so loved by craft beer drinkers first appeared in @entity15 pubs in 1928 and had a 10 - sided design			1
the dimpled design first appeared in 1948 , according to beer blogger @entity105			2
he said : ‘ the arrival of the dimple coincided with the triumph of bitter over ( dark ) mild , and amber beers look better in dimpled glasses than in straight - sides ones			2
’ @entity15 pubs buy their dimpled glassware from factories based oversea , with a jug costing around three times the price of a straight pint glass .			1

in the early 2000s it looked like the dimpled pint jug would become extinct
the last @entity15 factory that made them , in @entity18 , shut down in 2001
now they 're making a comeback thanks to hipsters embracing the design
