@entity7 has come across hundreds of wild animals on her travels in @entity10 , @entity11 and even the @entity13 rainforest , but came away unscathed from her encounters			1
however , while walking her dog in @entity16 , she was bitten by a poisonous snake and had to spend a week in hospital			1
her arm tripled in size and she struggled to breathe , and she was only healed when doctors requested anti-venom from a specialist clinic			1
victim : @entity7 spent a week in hospital after being bitten by an adder in @entity16 injury : the 29 - year - old was left with a horrible bruise after the encounter with a snake hospital : miss @entity7 's arm swelled up to three times its normal size thanks to the bite miss @entity7 , 29 , has been to @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38 , where she let a boa constrictor coil around her neck , but is now recovering at home in @entity42			1
' i still ca n't get over that after all the dangerous places i have been in the world it was a snake in @entity42 that nearly killed me , ' she said today			2
' i 've held lion cubs and even had a boa constrictor around my neck in the past , so i guess it 's pretty ironic that i get bit by a poisonous snake here in the @entity54			0
' the adventurous young woman was walking around @entity56 with her @entity58 shepherd @entity57 when she was attacked last thursday			0
danger : miss @entity7 filmed the adder on her mobile phone after it bit her at @entity56 reservoir bizarre : the patient 's arms were radically different sizes after she was bitten anger : miss @entity7 says the company that owns the site should be more careful about warning people ' i let @entity57 have a run around like i usually do and i sat down , ' she said			1
' the grass was reedy and all different lengths			0
i put my hand out and from nowhere i felt a sharp sting on my arm just like when you have an injection at the doctors			0
' i looked down and there was an adder sliding off through the grass			0
i was pretty shocked but decided to take some photos and a film in case it was n't a grass snake and i 'd need to identify it			0
' within minutes my arm started to swell and i knew it was n't a grass snake so i rang the ambulance			0
by the time it arrived my arm was massive - about three times the size			1
' then my throat and face puffed up and i had trouble breathing			2
i knew then that it was serious			0
' explorer : miss @entity7 posed with a boa constrictor wrapped around her neck in @entity38 in 2007 brave : she also posed for a picture holding a tiger cub during the same holiday at @entity103 , doctors were unable to treat her until they were sent anti-venom by reptile experts at the @entity105 , and she went into anaphylactic shock			1
' i just remember sitting on a chair then all of a sudden being on the bed with doctors and nurses all around me , ' she said			0
' the anti-venom came within the hour and as soon as i had that i started to breathe properly again which was a massive relief			2
' i had to stay there for six days on iv antibiotics and i think i became a bit of a celebrity on the ward because no one had ever had a patient who 'd be bitten by a poisonous snake before			2
' miss @entity7 came face - to - face with plenty of venomous beasts during her holiday in the @entity13 , but was not injured by them			1
traveller : now miss @entity7 has vowed to stay away from her local reservoir after her ordeal danger : but it was not until she returned to @entity16 that the traveller was hurt by an animal ' there were capybara , which are the largest rodents in the world , various insects such as katydid , as well as monkeys , bird eating spiders which are really big , ' she said			1
' there were tarantulas and poison frogs too			0
' she has vowed never to return to the reservoir , and criticised the facility 's owner @entity148 for not putting up warning signs			2
