by @entity0 earlier this week , it emerged that @entity2 - who usually has no problem sharing intimate details of her life , and her bottom , with the digital world - has reportedly banned the use of social media at her wedding to fiance @entity11 this weekend			1
but according to a new survey conducted by @entity14 , it seems most brides - to - be consider this embargo to be a little excessive , with only 14 per cent of @entity18 brides planning to completely ban the use of social media on their wedding days			1
of those questioned , almost half of the brides - to - be agreed that regardless of their own stance , setting ' digital rules ' ahead of their nuptials is an important consideration			2
banned ? @entity2 and @entity11 ( pictured this morning in @entity31 ) may be forbidding guests from using social media at their wedding - but a new study has found that only 14 per cent of brides - to - be will do the same fifty - eight per cent believe the bride and groom should be the first to post a photo , and 62 per cent agreed that bridesmaids should not post any photos of the bride in her dress ahead of the ceremony - which seems obvious enough			1
a minority of those questioned , only 26 per cent , say they were likely to encourage a specially - created hashtag to amalgamate the avid postings of their guests , a method employed by @entity54 star @entity53 at her wedding			0
ms @entity53 , who married husband @entity56 on @entity57 , created the # thesweetings hashtag , and the first wedding photo she shared garnered more than 48,000 ' likes ' from her fans			2
failed attempt : @entity62 ( left ) originally claimed her sister @entity63 ( center ) was banning guests from ' posting pictures ' at her high society wedding , but the bride herself and countless guests shared inside snaps anyway intimate details : supermodel @entity71 managed to mostly keep a lid on it at the wedding last weekend , but for this snap ( pictured ) which she shared with her five million - strong pack of @entity78 followers and as people all over the planet rely more and more on social media to keep in touch with their loved ones from afar , 36 per cent of brides surveyed said that live - streaming their nuptials or integrating @entity86 would be ' a nice touch ' for those who ca n't make it for the big occasion			1
how does long does it take for newly married brides to change their ' status ' on social media ? for a majority of them , not very long			2
fifty - six per cent of brides will adopt their new married names on social media the very same day of the wedding			1
for all to see : actress @entity53 ( pictured with new husband @entity56 ) created the hashtag # thesweetings to bring all the social media postings together on her wedding , like this photo shared by @entity53 's ' dog ' on @entity78 hush hush : some celebrity couples , including @entity109 and @entity110 ( left ) and @entity111 and @entity112 ( right ) kept their weddings so off the grid , many did n't even know they were married for weeks according to @entity116 , the reality tv star is issuing a contract than ' bans guests from uploading anything on social media , taking pictures and even talking about the big day with friends and family who were nâ€™t invited to the wedding			1
' it will interesting to see whether the couple mr @entity11 will be able to contain their over-sharing urges on their big day , as they have apparently planned			0
@entity133 model and socialite @entity131 , who married her long - time partner @entity134 over the weekend , were said to be implicating the same ban			0
' @entity63 and @entity134 want it to be private , and no one can post any pictures , ' the brides older sister , @entity62 , informed @entity141 before the wedding			0
that rule was clearly an epic failure , with @entity63 herself , her supermodel sister @entity71 , and pretty much the rest of the wedding party uploading photos throughout the day			0
some stars on the other hand have kept themselves so unplugged , @entity109 and @entity110 or @entity111 and @entity112 for example , that it was weeks before anyone even knew they had married			0
for most of us however , megawatt celebrity or otherwise , the simple truth is that it 's near impossible to escape the presence of social media , especially on one of the most important days of your life .			0

a new study by @entity14 has *revealed* that only 14 per cent of @entity18 brides - to - be plan to forbid the use of social media at their weddings
