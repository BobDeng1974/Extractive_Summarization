but the centuries - old practice could damage a baby ’s hips , a @entity7 surgeon warns			0
@entity1 has become popular again because of its perceived calming effect , after falling out of favour following concern that it could overheat the baby and restrict growth			1
@entity1 may have come back into fashion after speculation @entity4 was wrapped as he left hospital demand for swaddling clothes has soared by almost two - thirds in the @entity7 in recent years and has been fuelled recently by the first pictures of @entity4 in his mother ’s arms – although there is no evidence he was fully swaddled			1
in the @entity31 , nine in ten babies are swaddled in the first six months			0
but professor @entity32 of @entity33 says there is growing evidence that it can lead to hip abnormalities			1
professor @entity32 , a paediatric orthopaedic surgeon , said binding or bundling babies in blankets with the arms restrained and the lower limbs extended may force the hips to straighten and shift forward , risking misalignment which could lead to osteoarthritis and hip replacement in middle age , or even dislocation			1
in @entity51 a programme to encourage grandmothers not to swaddle their grandchildren has halved the rate of hip dislocation			0
one baby in five is born with a hip abnormality but factors after birth also have a role and swaddling may delay improvement , professor @entity32 said in the @entity61			1
he said swaddling can be safe if it does not stop the baby ’s legs from bending up and out at the hips , because this position allows for natural development of the hip joints			2
demand for swaddling clothes has soared by almost two - thirds in the @entity7 in recent years and has been fuelled recently by the first pictures of @entity4 in his mother 's arms ‘ commercial products for swaddling should have a loose pouch or sack for the babies ’ legs and feet , allowing plenty of hip movement , ’ he said , adding that healthcare professionals need to give mothers advice about how to swaddle their children safely , so their legs are not tightly wrapped and pressed together			2
@entity86 of the @entity87 said : ‘ there are concerns about the growing use of swaddling because of the possibility of overheating the baby , and the increased risk of cot death			2
also , as this research suggests , swaddling , and especially tight swaddling , may affect the baby ’s natural posture			0
‘ we advise parents to avoid swaddling , but it is also crucial that we take into account each mother ’s cultural background			0
’ @entity105 , from @entity106 , said : ‘ swaddling should not be employed in my view			0
’ dr @entity108 of the @entity109 , @entity110 , said : ‘ i would advise that if a baby needs to be wrapped up to get off to sleep that parents do this in a sympathetic and loose manner and not tight , especially around the baby ’s hips			0
