researchers studied fossilised remains of a group of @entity3 ( artist 's impression )			1
the semi-aquatic dinosaurs lived 160 million years ago many reptiles , such as lizards and turtles abandon their eggs after laying			1
in fact , only five per cent of mammals feed and protect their young after giving birth			0
but , in a new study , paleontologists have found evidence that dinosaurs may have bucked this lizard trend			0
fossils reveal that a particular group known as @entity3 were caring parents - and it could be the oldest record of such care ever found			1
the researchers from the @entity26 , along with colleagues from @entity28 and @entity29 , studied fossilised remains of the small semi-aquatic dinosaurs that live around 160 million years ago during the @entity32			1
the fossils , which were found by a farmer in @entity35 , in western @entity36 of @entity28 , four years ago , included an adult surrounded by six smaller juveniles			1
this suggests the dinosaurs were living as a family at the time of their death			1
by comparison , most modern reptiles leave the youngsters to fend for themselves once they hatch			0
dr @entity47 , who led the work at the @entity26 , said that the young dinosaurs all appeared to be from the same clutch and were living with a parent			2
philydrosauras were part of a group of dinosaurs known as choristodera			2
he said : ' the fact that six young surround what appears to be an adult suggests the animals were in natural close proximity at the time of death			2
' although it is possible that the individuals were all swept together during or soon after the event that killed them it is feel that this specimen more likely represents an instance of post-natal parental care			0
the fossils included an adult surrounded by six smaller juveniles ( illustrated )			1
this suggests the dinosaurs were living as a family at the time of their death			2
previous examples of post-natal care in dinosaurs are extremely rare and it has only been reported in two types of dinosaurs , and a small lizard called a pelycosaur the fossils ( pictured ) were found in @entity35 , western @entity36 of @entity28 , four years ago			1
they are said to represent the oldest record of post-natal parental care in diapsids - a group that include all reptiles ' that @entity91 shows parental care of the young after hatching suggests protection by the adult , presumably against predators			1
' their relatively small size would have meant that choristoderes were probably exposed to high predation pressure			0
in august , amateur paleontologists found fossils said to be about 120 million years old in the @entity103 beds of the @entity35 , northeastern @entity28			1
the positioning and nature of the fossils shows they all died together , possibly as a result of a landslide caused by a volcanic eruption which would not have given any time for escape			0
but the area was clearly not a nest either , said researchers			0
though the entire specimen is only about 2ft ( 0.6m ) across , it contains fossils from 25 creatures , all of the species @entity119 - from the @entity120 for parrot lizard			0
psittacosaurs were gazelle - like plant eaters and are among the most abundant dinosaurs yet discovered			0
this suggests this was a nursery where babies were left in the care of an adult , dubbed ' dinosaur babysitters ' , said @entity132 researchers @entity133 and researcher professor @entity135			2
' this specimen represents the oldest record of post-natal parental care in diapsids - a group of animals that include all reptiles - to our knowledge and is the latest in an increasingly detailed collection of choristoderes exhibiting different levels of reproduction and parental care			1

experts believe the area was a ' nursery ' where babies were left in the care of an adult , dubbed ' dinosaur babysitters ' the new study , which is published in the @entity211 , was conducted by @entity212 along with researchers from the @entity214 in @entity215 and the @entity216 , in @entity29			2
they said that although the group appear to be a family , the sex of the adult is not know			2
in some modern species of birds , males play a key role in rearing their young , while in other animals this care is left to the females			0
however , the researchers also believe that the small @entity230 dinosaurs may have also given birth to live young rather than laying eggs			1
dr @entity47 said : ' strategies , such as live birth , and post-natal parental care may have improved survival of the offspring			0
' ' dinosaur babysitter ' fossils were found in the @entity103 beds of the @entity35 in northeastern @entity28			0

most reptiles , such as lizards and turtles , abandon their eggs after laying
but , it appears a number of dinosaurs may have cared for their young
fossilised remains of a group of @entity91 has suggested the group was living as part of a family when they died
the fossils included an adult surrounded by six smaller juveniles
@entity91 was semi-aquatic dinosaur that lived 160 million years ago
it 's said to be the oldest record of post-natal care from the @entity268
