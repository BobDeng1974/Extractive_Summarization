by @entity0 last updated at 8:15 am on 29th november 2011 police abandoned the streets to opportunistic looters during the august riots , an inquiry has concluded			1
by not getting a grip at the outbreak of the violence , officers allowed the impression to take hold that the streets had been surrendered to thousands of yobs			2
disturbingly , the report added that unless police improve their response few rule out the prospect of riots in the future			2
chaos : a fire rips through a building in @entity22 , @entity23 , during the disorder			1
the official inquiry into the five days of violence ¿ which cost the country at least £ 500million ¿ concluded the shameful scenes were not motivated by ' politics ' the official inquiry into the five days of violence – which cost the country at least £ 500million – concluded the shameful scenes were not motivated by ‘ politics ’			0
instead , the rioters ’ main objectives were getting their hands on ‘ luxury branded goods ’ which ‘ confer instant status ’			0
the report describes looters queuing up inside shops to get the best products , trying on trainers in the wreckage of stores and admitting their motivation was ‘ greed ’			0
trigger : the shooting of father - of - four @entity50 sparked rioting which spread across the country the panel , established by deputy prime minister @entity54 , concluded : ‘ rioters believed they would be able to loot and damage without being challenged by the police			1
in the hardest - hit areas , they were correct			1
’ @entity59 had claimed the shocking scenes witnessed in august , which included 5,000 crimes and five fatalities , had been sparked by @entity65 cuts			0
but panel member @entity66 said : ‘ these were not riots that were political , these were particularly characterised by opportunistic looting and very much targeted at brands			1
’ the panel , which interviewed those who lost their homes and businesses , said the vast majority believed the ‘ sole trigger ’ for disturbances was the perception that the police ‘ could not contain ’ the scale of rioting in the capital			1
between 13,000 and 15,000 people were ' actively involved ' in rioting which swept across the country between august 6 and 10			1
more than 4,000 suspected rioters have been arrested with nine out of 10 already known to the police , the study said			1
more than 5,000 crimes were committed - and there were five deaths			1
there were 1,860 incidents of arson and criminal damage , 1,649 burglaries , 141 incidents of disorder and 366 cases of violence against the person			1
the final bill could be around £ 500 million , with up to £ 300 million of claims under the @entity103 and £ 50million on policing @entity23			1

miss @entity66 said scenes from @entity22 , @entity23 , in which it ‘ looked as if police were backing off ’ , led to a ‘ perception that the streets were there for the taking ’			0
the panel members , headed by @entity115 , have a long history of working in the public and voluntary sector			0
mr @entity115 has worked for homeless charities and was chief executive of two local councils			0
miss @entity66 spent time as a barrister and a @entity124 governor			0
they were joined on the panel by @entity127 , of the @entity128 and the @entity129 for one parent families , and @entity131 , who founded the @entity132 for teenagers at risk of gang crime			0
riots broke out in @entity22 on august 6 , two days after the fatal shooting by police of 29 - year - old @entity50			1
unrest spread to other cities , including @entity140 , @entity141 and @entity142			1
mr @entity115 said : ‘ our research has also led us to conclude that riots of this nature will happen again unless immediate action is taken			0
’ the riots , communities and victims panel painted a devastating picture of a country in which ‘ some would argue consumerism is the new religion ’			0
it said : ‘ the desire to own goods which give the owner high status ( such as branded trainers and digital gadgets ) was seen as an important factor behind the riots			0
’ looters repeatedly targeted the same types of shops across the country , including @entity168 , @entity169 and electrical stores			1
the panel went on : ‘ the ownership of luxury branded goods confers instant status			0
it is therefore perhaps not surprising these goods became the rioters ’ main objectives			0
’ disorder : a hooded youth walks past a burning vehicle in @entity182 on august 8			1
inquiry panel member @entity66 said : ' these were not riots that were political , these were particularly characterised by opportunistic looting and very much targeted at brands			1
' the panel , demanding much improved planning from police in future , said : ‘ the police decision to withdraw to the periphery of riot - hit areas left many communities feeling they had been abandoned			2
’ the panel also called for insurers , who were accused of a ‘ poor response ’ in some cases , to do far more to pay compensation claims promptly			1
it also called for an overhaul of the @entity206 , which is used to claim compensation from the state			2
the panel estimated up to 15,000 were ‘ actively involved ’ in the riots			1
more than 4,000 suspected rioters have been arrested with nine out of ten already known to the police , the study said			0
an @entity215 spokesman said the riots had presented ‘ considerable challenges ’ to the police			0
@entity0 : ' riots were opportunistic ' the streets were still ablaze when a string of senior @entity222 figures took to the airwaves to blame @entity226 ‘ cuts ’ for the riots			2
the party ’s candidate for @entity229 , @entity230 , explained the initial outbreak of violence and looting by saying : ‘ @entity22 ’s had a 9 per cent cut nearly in its government grant			2
’ @entity236 , as the riots spread nationwide , then pointed to the trebling in tuition fees , the axing of the @entity240 and the closure of local job centres			2
@entity243 , @entity222 mp for @entity244 , also suggested the government ’s austerity drive was to blame			0
but , if @entity248 and her colleagues were hoping yesterday ’s report would validate their argument , they would have been sorely disappointed			0
the most striking rebuttal of their claim came from panel member @entity66 who explicitly said the riots were not ‘ political ’			2
she said that , in the case of the initial outbreak of trouble in @entity22 , the ‘ catalyst ’ had been the police shooting of @entity50			1
opportunistic : a masked youth walks away from a blaze during the riots with reference to the way the riots then spread , she concluded : ‘ these were not riots that were political , these were particularly characterised by opportunistic looting			1
’ the members of the panel have a long track record of working with disadvantaged groups , including teenagers at risk of social exclusion , refugees and the homeless			0
it was set up after @entity282 called for an inquiry into the causes of the riots			0
none of the panel ’s recommendations for preventing further disturbances make any reference to spending cuts – which had barely begun at the time of the riots			0
where tuition fees are briefly discussed in the report , it ’s in the context of some children , who live in deprived areas , saying they do not feel they will have the opportunity to get a good job or go to university			0
however the panel says children in the same class as those who said they felt angry about the likes of @entity240 cuts had instead expressed ‘ optimism and self - sufficiency ’			2
the report points to concerns among young black and @entity314 men that they are being unfairly targeted by police stop and search			2
but panel chairman @entity115 said the riots ‘ were very different ’ to the race riots of 1981 sparked by so - called stop and search ‘ @entity320 ’			2
of those offenders brought before the courts so far , 42 per cent were white , 46 per cent black and 7 per cent @entity314 .			0

rioting ' triggered by *handling* of death of @entity50 '
disorder spread because people believed @entity330 could *n't* contain the trouble
up to 15,000 people ' actively involved ' in rioting
delays in paying compensation - with only one in 10 of the *largest* claims *settled*
' opportunistic looting targeted at brands *...* and it was not political '
