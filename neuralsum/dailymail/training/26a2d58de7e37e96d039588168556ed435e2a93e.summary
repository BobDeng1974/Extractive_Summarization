by @entity0 train drivers have been ordered not to stop at the station nearest to the @entity3 – because it is too hot			2
the @entity6 rail company says soaring temperatures mean it is not safe for trains to travel as quickly as usual			1
so , to minimise delays , it has ordered drivers to go straight through @entity12 – the main gateway to the @entity14			1
ca n't handle the heat : train services were slowed down or cancelled because of the soaring temperatures too warm a welcome : the sun meant that trains did not stop at @entity12 today the company said yesterday that its overhead cables , which date back to the 1950s and are in desperate need of upgrading , can not cope with trains travelling at normal speeds if the temperature is more than @entity27 ( @entity28 )			1
@entity29 said last night that the ageing cables were in the process of being updated			0
a spokesman apologised for any disruption and stressed that the vast majority of services would still run to @entity12			1
@entity6 confirmed that at least nine services on the @entity37 to @entity39 service would not stop at @entity12 , while there would also be revisions and cancellations affecting trains headed for @entity44			1
a spokesman said : ‘ there are some revisions in place to our mainline timetable			0
we are working with @entity29 to minimise the disruption for our customers			0
’ temperatures are predicted to drop before the opening ceremony on friday			0
but fears are growing that @entity57 ’s antiquated transport system will cause chaos for millions travelling to the @entity59			0
the network was widely declared to have failed its first ‘ test run ’ for the @entity14 on monday night			1
as 40,000 spectators flocked to the @entity3 for the opening ceremony rehearsal , two key routes to the stadium were suspended			0
the @entity66 was closed for two hours by a power cut , while the @entity57 line closed for an hour after a track buckled in the heat			1
many performers were late as a result			0
excuse : @entity6 trains said the problems were down to older sections of overhead lines expanding and sagging in high temperatures graduate @entity78 , 22 , of @entity79 , @entity80 , said he left home at 4.30pm but did not arrive at the stadium until about 8.10pm – missing the first 40 minutes			1
after the ceremony , spectators were forced to queue for nearly an hour and a half just to get into @entity12 tube station because it was so overcrowded			1
many did not get home until the early hours			0
there were similar problems on the @entity91 last week , when a fault on another key @entity14 route – the @entity94 – meant trains were suspended and some passengers stuck inside boiling hot carriages for up to 25 minutes			1
and those who have chosen to travel by road have fared even worse , with athletes reporting that it has taken up to five hours to get from @entity102 to the @entity103 by bus			0
signs intended to welcome @entity107 visitors to the @entity14 are ‘ completely incoherent ’			2
the huge banners are hung in the shopping centre which borders the @entity3 , @entity12			2
but the @entity110 said the words were back to front and not joined up properly			0
it was the equivalent of an @entity114 language sign intending to say ‘ welcome to @entity57 ’ , instead saying ‘ n o @entity115 ’			0
@entity12 apologised and said it would replace the posters			2
arduous journey : many passengers travelling from @entity57 's @entity39 during tonight 's rush hour could be affected ( file picture )			2

soaring heat meant some main line trains were not stopping at the @entity14 serving station of @entity12
@entity6 warned of delays on services from @entity39 to @entity128 , @entity129 and @entity37
problems are down to older sections of overhead lines expanding and sagging in high temperatures
