by @entity1 medical correspondent published : 13:24 est , 4 april 2013 updated : 13:26 est , 4 april 2013 the number of drugs available through the government ¿ s flagship @entity4 has now been cut from 50 to 27 by @entity6 , a new body headed by sir @entity8 the number of cancer treatments available to patients has been halved on a new national list			1
the move – described as ‘ alarming ’ and ‘ a step backwards ’ by campaigners – could mean many new patients are unable to benefit from the government ’s flagship @entity4			1
the £ 200million - a - year idea , launched in april 2011 , was intended to provide life - extending help for sufferers and has led to more than 25,000 patients in @entity6 getting drugs which are not available on the @entity6 because they are not approved by @entity24 , the rationing body			1
but the number of drugs available through the fund has now been cut from 50 to 27 by @entity6			1
this means the number of cancers that can be treated has been cut from 129 to 65			1
some of the drugs have been cut from the list because they have been given the go - ahead by @entity24 in recent months and can now be prescribed normally by doctors			1
but other treatments no longer approved include the pioneering radiation therapy given to surgeon @entity37 , who fought to get it used routinely on the @entity6 after forcing her health trust into a funding u-turn over treatment for liver tumours			2
as a result , the treatment was approved by many regions making up the @entity4			2
but it emerged yesterday it has been omitted from a national list from @entity6 , a new body headed by sir @entity8 , who has faced calls for his resignation over his role in the @entity53 scandal			2
other treatments which have been removed from the list include a drug used for a wide range of blood cancers , as well as those used for leukaemia , lung cancer , ovarian cancer and brain cancer			2
the blood cancer drug , @entity65 , was the fourth most frequently requested treatment through the fund last year			0
@entity68 , chief executive of the @entity69 , said : ‘ this appears to be a clear step backwards for cancer patients in terms of access to drugs			1
‘ the list of cancer drugs which will be funded has been cut in half with no explanation			1
we are worried that this will restrict access to drugs which were previously routinely available			0
‘ the government has questions to answer about this , and we will be writing to the prime minister to seek urgent clarification about this			0
’ mr @entity68 said he was concerned by the lack of transparency over how the new list was compiled			0
‘ clinicians were supposed to be in the driving seat but the centralisation of this list suggests the opposite ’ he added			0
the government ’s aim , which was a @entity99 election pledge , was to enable @entity6 doctors to prescribe any drug if they believed a cancer patient could benefit			1
but the new list has slashed treatments available to new patients , even when as many as four out of 10 regional panels had approved their use			0
a form of internal radiotherapy called @entity109 used where bowel cancer has spread to the liver has been axed , even though previously available in the majority of regions			0
around 500 patients a year could miss out as a result			0
other treatments which have been removed from the list include a drug used for a wide range of blood cancers , as well as those used for leukaemia , lung cancer , ovarian cancer and brain cancer but professor @entity127 , head of the @entity4 , insisted patients would be better off , partly because some of the drugs dropped from the national list had been agreed for routine use			1
instead of having to get these drugs via the @entity4 with access that varied in different regions , doctors would be able to get them normally			1
he said : ‘ many more patients are going to be able access these drugs from this week than could have done last week			0
. ‘ we have not been levelling down we ’ve been levelling up			0
’ he said doctors could apply on behalf of individual patients if a drug was not on the fast - track national list , but was unable to say how long the process would take			1
dr @entity145 , @entity146 at @entity147 said : ‘ the expectations of clinicians are that new patients will be offered the same treatments as they would have been able to receive under the @entity4			1
‘ it is simply unacceptable that patients are being denied these life - extending treatments			1
‘ the @entity4 is the only mechanism which ensures that @entity6 patients in @entity6 have routine access to cancer drugs and treatments and this must continue			1
‘ any changes made must ensure that cancer patients continue to have access to drugs and treatments , including @entity109 if recommended by their oncologist			2
’ denied : the number of drugs available through the fund has now been cut from 50 to 27 by @entity6 almost two thirds of cancer treatments considered by @entity24 ( the @entity24 ) are rejected			1
the future of the @entity4 has not been guaranteed beyond next january , when an estimated 16,000 patients could lose out each year			2
the ‘ alarming ’ move has been condemned by a group of @entity176 led by @entity177 ( @entity178 ) who blamed the government for breaking its pledge that @entity6 reforms would not lead to renewed restrictions on cancer drugs			1
they called on ministers to urgently ensure cancer patients were not in a worse @entity187 , chief executive of @entity188 , said the list left many questions unanswered			0
he said ‘ what we are concerned about is that these arrangements are temporary and only give bowel cancer patients limited breathing space			0
‘ we still need some assurance from @entity179 that patients will continue to access the drugs that successfully treat the disease , beyond the end of the year			0
’ @entity202 , @entity203 at @entity6 , said doctors would still be able to make individual funding requests for patients even if the treatment is not on the national list			2
but critics say the process for such requests has not yet been organised and patients could face delays when they may have only months to live			0
dr @entity202 insisted the new list was a ‘ national levelling up ’ of the number of approved treatments			0
he said ‘ this means more people will benefit			0
it is really important that we stretch every penny of the @entity4 so we get maximum benefit to the most people we possibly can			2
“ this is a step forward for the @entity4			0
in recent weeks cancer specialists from across the country have been working together to agree one national list of approved fast - track drugs for the @entity4 , which will then allow more uniform access to treatment and reduce variation of prescribing across the country			1
‘ having one consistent method for consideration of overall clinical benefit and funding means that all applications will be assessed by the same criteria			0
regional variation of the past is clearly not acceptable for patients			0
clinicians can still apply for drugs to join the national list of approved fast - track cancer drugs			2

move could mean many new patients will be unable to benefit from the government ’s flagship @entity4
*scheme* was intended to provide life - extending help for cancer sufferers by getting drugs not available on the @entity6
but number of drugs available through fund has now been cut from 50 to 27
means number of cancers that can be treated has been cut from 129 to 65
