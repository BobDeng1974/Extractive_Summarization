violent extremists killing children and others in @entity4 , @entity5 , @entity6 and other parts of the world may cite @entity9 as a justification , but the @entity11 should be careful about calling them @entity9 radicals , secretary of state @entity0 told an audience of opinion leaders friday at the @entity15			1

@entity42 repeatedly referred to radicalized @entity9 as a ' poisonous ' ideology , but @entity41 would n't imply that religion was a motivating factor of terrorists ' we will certainly not defeat our foes by vilifying potential partners , ' the top @entity33 diplomat said			1
' we may very well fuel the very fires that we want to put out			0
' @entity0 's comments highlighted a division between the @entity33 and its closest allies , including @entity61 president @entity60 , whom @entity0 memorably pressured into an awkward hug last week as a show of solidarity with the people of @entity66 after terrorists attacked @entity69 's headquarters			2
@entity60 told the same audience earlier friday that @entity9 extremism is a problem that must be opposed			1
on thursday , @entity43 foreign secretary @entity73 stood next to @entity0 and urged the defeat of what he called ' the scourge of violent @entity78 extremism			2
' the @entity41 administration has come under criticism for its unwillingness to differentiate between @entity9 extremism and other forms of extremist violence			1
earlier this week , rep. @entity85 , a @entity86 from @entity87 and @entity4 war veteran , said it was a ' bipartisan concern ' that @entity41 and his top aides do n't use the term ' @entity9 extremism			1

@entity0 told opinion leaders attending the forum , ' we will certainly not defeat our foes by vilifying potential partners			2
' we may very well fuel the very fires that we want to put out ' @entity41 also suggested that the @entity33 had an ' advantage ' over countries like @entity43 when it comes to fighting terrorism because ' our @entity28 populations , they feel themselves to be @entity33			1
' ' there is this incredible process of immigration and assimilation that is part of our tradition			0
that is probably our greatest strength , ' he said			0
earlier in the week @entity41 's spokesman said that the world should just call the radicals fighting with @entity94 what they are : terrorists			1
' these terrorists are individuals who would like to cloak themselves in the veil of a particular religion , ' @entity46 press secretary @entity146 said			0
' but based on the fact that the religious leaders of that religion have roundly condemned their actions , those religious leaders have indicated that their actions are entirely inconsistent with @entity9			0
' @entity146 said the fact that the ' majority of victims of terror attacks ' are @entity28 ' is a pretty clear indication that this is not a matter of the world being at war with @entity9			1
' ' the world and the @entity33 ... is at war with these individuals , these violent extremists who carry out these acts of terror and try to justify it by invoking this religion			1
he later said @entity94 members were trying to ' invoke their own distorted deviant view of @entity9 to try to justify ' their actions			0
' and i think that is completely illegitimate			0
and what we should do is we should call it what it is			0
and it ’s an act of terror , and it ’s one that we roundly condemn			0
