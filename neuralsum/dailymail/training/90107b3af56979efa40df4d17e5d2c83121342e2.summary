his parents , @entity33 and @entity34 , launched a public appeal for donors in september after failing to find a match within their family			0
they used social media and blogged to find a donor for their son , whose illness means he has to be admitted to hospital if he suffers a simple cough or cold			0
as a result , there was a huge increase in the number of @entity9 people applying to become a bone marrow donor on the @entity53 register			1
mr @entity22 said : ‘ when we were told that there was a matching donor , we just could n't believe it			0
‘ our feelings towards @entity22 's donor are overwhelming because that person is giving @entity22 such an important gift			0
if i could , i would go to meet @entity22 's donor right now and give them the biggest hug in the world			0
none of @entity22 's relatives were matches so his parents launched a campaign to find a donor			2
it inspired a 10-fold increase in the number of @entity9 people joining the bone marrow donor register ‘ a matching donor means that we can go ahead with @entity22 's bone marrow transplant			1
it is a very serious procedure but we know that it will give @entity22 the best possible chance at survival			0
‘ we hope that having the support of those around us will give us the strength we will need to get through the challenges ahead			0
’ @entity53 estimates that more than 3,000 people from all backgrounds have joined the bone marrow register as a result of @entity22 's appeal			1
the blood cancer charity revealed that 480 @entity9 people applied to the bone marrow register online in september and october , compared to 40 joining the register in the same period the previous year			1

this means @entity22 ( pictured with his father , @entity33 ) will be able to have the transplant next month mr @entity22 said : ‘ friends , family , and people who we have never met before have backed the campaign to recruit more donors and we would like to thank everyone who has been involved			2
‘ every single person who has joined the register could be a match for someone in desperate need of a transplant and help another family out there			0
‘ no one can imagine what it is like to be in the position of needing a bone marrow donor for your child until you experience it			2
we have been very fortunate in finding a donor and i know that it is not the case for every family			0
‘ the campaign was never just about finding a donor for @entity22			2
it was about ensuring that there will be matching donors for years to come - for our children 's families and grandchildren 's families			0
mr @entity22 said : ' friends , family , and people who we have never met before have backed the campaign to recruit more donors and we would like to thank everyone who has been involved ' ‘ as a community , i want us to continue this campaign to recruit more bone marrow donors so that every family is able to find a donor for their loved one			1
’ @entity150 , @entity9 recruitment manager at @entity53 , said : ‘ we are absolutely delighted that a matching donor has been found for @entity22			2
‘ his story has inspired so many people to sign up as donors and , in particular , we have seen a huge increase in the number of @entity9 donors on the bone marrow register			1
‘ @entity9 patients in desperate need of a bone marrow transplant still have just a 40 per cent chance of finding a match			1
‘ it is so important that more @entity9 people sign up as bone marrow donors so that we can help more people like @entity22 in the future and so that no family has to go through an agonising wait to find out if they have a match			1
’ about 1,800 people need a bone marrow or stem cell transplant every year in the @entity176 – it is usually their last chance of survival			2
some 63 per cent of @entity176 patients will not find a matching donor within their families			0
according to @entity53 , a suitable donor can only be found for around half the people who need a life - saving bone marrow transplant			1
most donations – 90 per cent - now take place via peripheral blood stem cell collection , which is done at an outpatient appointment and is similar to donating blood .			0

@entity22 , two , has a rare blood disorder called @entity31 7
unless he has a bone marrow transplant before @entity14 he is *highly* likely to develop an aggressive form of childhood leukaemia
none of his relatives are a match so parents campaigned to find a donor
the campaign inspired a 10-fold increase in number of @entity9 people joining the @entity53 bone marrow register and a donor was found
he will have the transplant next month
