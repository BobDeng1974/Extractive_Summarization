prime minister @entity0 is being haunted by his own , damning words , in a video that has resurfaced today			2
the embattled @entity4 leader this afternoon tried to shrug off the fact nearly 40 per cent of his own colleagues voted for a leadership spill , insisting ' this matter is now behind us '			0
but he was n't nearly so forgiving when 31 of former prime minister @entity11 's colleagues voted against her leadership in february 2012			1
the video from @entity14 shows mr @entity0 questioning how ms @entity11 could continue as leader , considering her lack of party support			1
' given that one third of her parliamentary colleagues , and a quarter of her cabinet colleagues have expressed their lack of confidence in her , how can she claim to have a mandate to continue as prime minister ? ' ms @entity11 had just defeated mr @entity39 in the second of four leadership spills during that era between the pair by a margin of 71 to 31			0
the then prime minister rebuked him - ' he comes into this @entity46 having survived his leadership issues by one vote ! ' - but he was n't done			0
contrition : mr @entity0 said ' good government starts today ' - some sixteen months into his prime ministership pained : more than half of his backbench colleagues voted to spill the leadership changed times : mr @entity0 ( left , with wife @entity56 ) today defeated a leadership spill motion by 61 votes to 39 mr @entity0 ( flanked by parliamentary colleagues ) survived the motion but was politically wounded by the internal dissent of the past few weeks mr @entity0 arrived at today 's party meeting with foreign minister @entity63 - touted as a potential leadership contender herself - by his side ' mr speaker , i have a supplementary question for the prime minister			1
' how can the prime minister claim to be leading a united team when the former prime minister and former foreign minister said that the prime minister had ' lost the trust of the @entity77 people ' and 31 of her caucus colleagues backed the former prime minister ? ' years on , it is mr @entity0 himself who is damaged by a lack of support from his own colleagues , with 39 liberals voting for his leadership to be re-considered			2
and history does repeat itself			0
opposition leader @entity88 today asked mr @entity0 : ' now that one third of his parliamentary colleagues have today expressed their lack of confidence in him , how can ( mr @entity0 ) claim to have a mandate ? ' as mr @entity0 knows , that 's a dangerous line of questioning .			1

2012 video of @entity0 questioning @entity11 in @entity46 resurfaces
mr @entity0 asks her how she can claim a mandate as leader given several colleagues had just voted against her
the same thing *happened* to mr @entity0 today
@entity88 asked mr @entity0 the same question
