@entity0 is facing major signal problems which could prevent any trains from being allowed to run when the line 's due to open in 2018			1
the @entity5 's Â£ 15billion new railway is on course for humiliation as engineers admitted the complex signal issues may not be resolved in the next three years			1
a source inside the project claimed it was still likely that @entity0 would open , with reduced services , but suggested said it was also possible that no trains would be running at all in 2018			2
embarrassment : @entity0 is facing major signal problems which could prevent any trains from being allowed to run when it 's due to open in 2018 @entity0 adopts both traditional metro signalling and modern high - tech systems to connect trains on the 26 miles of new tracks underneath @entity22 to existing major cross-country rail lines			1
as it stands , engineers are struggling to create ' interfaces ' - meaning the trains are unable to shift smoothly from the orthodox metro system to the @entity29 used once outside central @entity22			1
@entity0 's chairman , @entity31 , conceded that a ' mitigation plan ' was being put in place , @entity30 reports			0
the admission confirms the worry that signalling on the 73 - mile @entity37 - to - @entity38 link wo n't work properly by 2018			1
@entity39 and @entity40 inspecting @entity0 at @entity41 in january last year ' this is one of the technical challenges that @entity0 brings with it , ' added mr @entity31			0
a source who has recently worked on @entity0 told @entity30 : ' the most likely scenario is that @entity0 will open with a significantly reduced service			0
' a second source said : ' in the extreme you would n't be able to run any trains			2
signalling technology in this industry is something that has challenged everybody for a very , very long time			0
' a huge part of @entity0 equates to a a new underground system , running through busy tube stations such as @entity41 and @entity58			0
but @entity59 , the government - backed body in charge of the country 's most important train tracks , is hoping to introduce a highly complex signalling system across the lines , which will connect with @entity0			2
concern : @entity0 's chairman , @entity31 , conceded that a ' mitigation plan ' was being put in place this will feature technology akin to @entity73 , providing pinpoint accuracy on the location of a train - so that more than one can stop and start on any single section of the line without the danger of a crash			0
the ability to locate the exact position of trains should make it easier to manage and increase the flow of @entity0 trains into @entity22			1
@entity0 , @entity87 's biggest construction project , is initially scheduled to run 24 trains per hour during peak periods , and it is hoped this will increase to 30			2
the major issue facing @entity0 is to the west of @entity22 , once the track passes through @entity95 station			1
plan : @entity0 , @entity87 's biggest construction project , is initially scheduled to run 24 trains an hour during peak periods , although the plan is to increase this to 30 industry experts suggest the issue was frustrated by @entity59 separately launching its own ' digital railway ' programme last year			1
this meant introducing advanced technology - such as software that accurately forecasts temperature and rainfall across the @entity110 's major lines			0
@entity0 has so far involved more than 10,000 construction workers across 40 sites and up to now encountered few problems .			0

project is facing humiliation as engineers fail to deal with signal problems
the 73 - mile @entity37 - to - @entity38 link involves 26 miles under @entity22
experts are struggling to create interfaces - so trains can shift between @entity29 signal system and *conventional* one used in central @entity22
