by @entity0 last updated at 8:53 am on 16th january 2012 @entity2 explorers are preparing to drill through almost two miles of ice into an @entity5 lake as they seek clues about life one million years ago			1
the team used a ' tractor train ' to tow nearly 70 tonnes of equipment to the @entity12 drilling site which is one of the most hostile environments on earth as they prepare for the operation			1
they will return in november to collect water and sediment from the buried lake using space industry standard ' clean technology '			2
@entity2 team : the @entity2 flag flies at lake @entity12 where the drilling will take place later this year			1
70 tonnes of equipment has since been moved into place ready for the operation they hope the samples will provide clues about the @entity34 's past climate			1
it could also help scientists assess the present - day stability of the @entity38 and implications for future rises in the sea level			0
the advance party , comprising four @entity2 engineers , braved temperatures of -35c as they transported the drilling equipment			1
they used powerful tractors to tow heavy containers of equipment on sledges and skis across deep snow and through steep mountain passes			1
explorers : the team of four who are braving freezing conditions to work at the @entity12 site final frontier : the @entity2 team will live in tents at the site as they collect samples from 1.8miles below the ice the 155 - mile journey through the @entity67 took them three days to complete			1
scientists have been planning the investigation for more than 15 years			0
the @entity71 , professor @entity72 from the @entity73 , said : ' the completion of this stage of the mission is a welcome one - we are now one step closer to finding out if new and unique forms of microbial life could have evolved in this environment			0
' the samples we hope to capture from @entity12 will be hugely valuable to the scientific community			0
' this year we will complete and test both the water sampling probe and the sediment corer			0
frozen wastes : @entity12 , where the drilling is being carried out , is in the @entity88			1
there are more than 400 subglacial lakes across @entity91 ' extracted sediment samples could give us an important insight in to the ancient history of the @entity38 , including past collapse , which would have implications for future sea level rise			2
' during phase two of the project researchers will use a high - pressure drill to create a borehole through 1.8miles of ice			0
they will then lower a titanium probe to measure and sample the water , followed by a corer to extract sediment from the lake			0
it will take around three days to drill through the ice and the scientists will have about 24 hours to gather samples before the hole starts to freeze over			2
plan : this graph shows how the team will create a 1.8mile borehole to the bottom of the lake over three days before lowering a corer to extract sediment the equipment has been left one mile from the actual drilling site so that the location remains unaffected by the equipment 's presence			1
@entity12 is around 8.6 miles long , 1.2 - 1.8 miles wide and 150m deep , around the size of @entity127 in the @entity128 , or @entity129 in the @entity130			1
@entity131 , @entity132 and @entity133 said : ' this is a major milestone for the programme and we are delighted that our complex logistical operations were a success this season			0
' working within the short @entity5 summer season adds pressure to our time on the continent , which is why we had to plan two stages of the programme			0
' the @entity12 programme is a consortium , funded by the @entity146 ( @entity146 ) , between @entity147 and the @entity148 - and the @entity2 university sector			0
more than 400 subglacial lakes have so far been discovered beneath @entity91 's vast ice sheet			2
a @entity153 team hopes soon to penetrate and collect samples from @entity155 in @entity91 .			2

team faced -35c temperatures as they moved 70 tonnes of equipment to drilling site through mountain range
samples from 1.8 miles under the ice are *expected* to reveal more about the @entity34 's past climate
drilling operation will be carried out in november
