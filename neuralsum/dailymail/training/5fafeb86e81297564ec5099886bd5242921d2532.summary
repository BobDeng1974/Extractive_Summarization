by @entity0 published : 11:40 est , 14 march 2013 updated : 15:53 est , 14 march 2013 the @entity2 's debut cosmetics line has been pulled from stores following a court order			1
@entity2 , @entity5 and @entity6 announced their range , @entity9 , last year and they were planning to roll - out it out at more than 5,000 retailers across the @entity12 this month			1
but the trio have been stopped from distributing their beauty products , as a @entity17 - based company called @entity18 is suing their licensing partner for ' stealing ' its name			1
not as smart as she thinks ? @entity2 ' came up ' with the name of the @entity9 line but is now being sued the firm 's owner @entity25 trademarked the @entity18 name back in 2010 and she sent a cease - and - desist letter to @entity29 , the company that produces the @entity2 - fronted @entity9 line , when the range was launched			1
miss @entity33 sought $ 10m ( £ 6.67m ) in damages from the sisters and @entity36 for ' stealing ' the name of her cosmetics line			0
she claimed that the girl 's company , for which they were guaranteed to make at least $ 6.2 million , would cause confusion in the marketplace			0
and it seems like the judge on the case agrees , according to @entity47 : ' @entity33 has demonstrated that [ she ] will likely lose business opportunities , customers and goodwill due to @entity29 ’s use of the confusingly similar @entity9 beauty marks , ' said @entity12 district judge @entity53 in her ruling			1
' the court has little doubt that , in short order , the @entity58 beauty products will likely eliminate @entity33 ’s business entirely , creating irreparable harm sufficient to justify an injunction			0
' triple threat : each of the sisters has products in the line and they are all being sued while this injunction is preliminary at this point ( non effective yet ) and could be postponed if @entity29 appeals the decision , the future is n't looking great for the famous sisters			2
@entity33 first raised the issue with the girls in july 2012 when she claimed it infringed on her @entity77 make - up line , which she founded back in 2004			2
@entity17 native @entity33 told the @entity78 : ' i developed the @entity18 line myself , built my business through my own hard work , and took the legal steps necessary to protect it			2
' and yet i have now been forced into legal battle with the @entity86 simply because they have decided to take something that does n't belong to them			0
' ongoing : @entity33 first raised the issue with the girls in july 2012 when she claimed it infringed on her @entity77 make - up line , which she founded back in 2004 on the @entity18 website it states the word means colour in @entity97 , but adds how miss @entity33 used her 22 years ( experience ) of creating looks for thousands of women ' and ' personally selected all of the shades and has personally made all of the formulas			1
' and in her formal federal court response she claims the promotion of @entity9 was likely to mislead customers into thinking her line is associated with the @entity2 sisters			1
she added : ' the false association is damaging … and threatens to destroy its business			0
' according to the counter-claims , @entity29 has paid the @entity86 an upfront advance of $ 1m for licensing rights , with guaranteed minimum royalty payments of $ 4.6 ( £ 3.07 ) million to $ 5.2 ( £ 3.47 ) million , depending on launch dates of various products			2
as part of the deal , they allegedly have some power over the product line and that @entity2 ' proposed ' it be called @entity9			1
miss @entity33 's attorney @entity122 claims the 32 - year - old should have known better			0
friends in high places : @entity25 with @entity127 star @entity126 at the @entity128 he pointed to discussions by representatives for himself and @entity132 , which allegedly acted as @entity2 's product - placement agent for a show that was being produced by @entity2			1
he said : ' on or about may 2010 , representatives for @entity33 and @entity132 were engaged in discussions regarding the possible product placement of the @entity139 cosmetics line on the television reality show special @entity141 that was scheduled to air on @entity142 @entity142 following an episode of keeping up with the @entity86			2
' no deal was ever reached , but if this is true she could have had advance knowledge that the name was already in use			0
@entity2 spokesman @entity150 claims the sisters ' have acted properly at all times '			0
this is not the only lawsuit the product line is engulfed in at the moment			0
@entity158 - based @entity157 is also suing for alleged trademark infringement .			0

@entity25 who trademarked @entity18 in 2010 , is suing @entity29 , the company that produces the @entity2 - fronted @entity9 line
