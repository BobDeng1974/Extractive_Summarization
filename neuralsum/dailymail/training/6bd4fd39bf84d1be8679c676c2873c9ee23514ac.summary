simple measures such as staying inside and watching tv can help combat potential flu epidemics , experts have revealed			1
vaccinations and medications provide an effective form of response in the face of an outbreak			0
but avoiding social activity and staying at home can help halt the spread of infectious diseases , scientists have said			1
@entity27 privately initiated or policy directed , actions calling for the closure of schools and entertainment venues , and cancelling public events are becoming more relevant in control strategies			0
lead author of the study economist @entity36 , from the @entity37 of @entity38 , said : the swine flu outbreak that hit @entity40 in april 2009 could have been worse , but spread of the virus was reduced by people 's behavioural response of distancing themselves from each other			1
' the researchers created a a new model that incorporates behavioural responses into existing models of disease spread			0
in april 2009 in @entity40 , following confirmation of a new strain of a / h1n1 influenza virus , or swine flu , the federal government closed public schools in @entity40 and ' social distancing ' measures were put in place			1
researchers looked at television viewing in the home in @entity40 as an indicator of behavioural response , during the pandemic			1
professor @entity36 said television ratings are consistently and widely available and ' highly correlate ' with time spent in the home			2
the data provides a good indicator for the level of social interaction , with time spent watching tv increasing with the amount of time spent in the home			1
when people are at home , they limit the number of other people they come into contact with			0
in march 2009 following confirmation of a new strain of a / h1n1 influenza virus , the federal government closed public schools in @entity40 and ' social distancing ' measures were put in place ' we found that the behavioural response to the outbreak was initially strong but waned sooner than expected , ' professor @entity36 said			1
' this dynamic is interpreted as a rebound effect			0
' at the onset of the flu outbreak , the public responded strongly to the directed control policies			0
but after a period of time of staying at home , people began to leave the confines of their houses			2
professor @entity36 said : ' this suggests that efforts to utilise social distancing to mitigate disease spread may have a limited window of efficacy , before pent up demand for activities outside the home takes precedence			1
' the study revealed measures including using face masks can be effective at halting the spread of flu during an outbreak in 1918 the influenza pandemic in @entity119 reflected that behaviour pattern			1
when the perceived risk decreased , the public reverted back to normal behaviour			0
' our study reinforces the view that capturing behavioural changes that amplify or blunt the transmission rate is key to improve our ability to make predictions about the impact of epidemics , ' said co-author dr @entity133 , from @entity24			0
the study 's findings revealed differences in age groups and socio - economic groups			2
the researchers found that the increase in television watching for children and wealthier groups was more pronounced			2
the authors speculate that those from poorer backgrounds may face greater difficulty in taking self - protective measures , like social distancing , because of less flexibility with working hours			1
they suggest the differences could have implications for policy makers directing responses to future outbreaks , directing more resources to help those with lower financial means			0
professor @entity36 , said : ' this affects public health authorities tasked with planning epidemics			0
' this has implications for management advice , including the allocation of resources between pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions			1
' other forms of non-pharmaceutical interventions include closing businesses and distributing face masks			2
but people can also take personal action , washing their hands thoroughly and wearing personal face masks to help reduce transmission			0
the study was published in the journal @entity180 .			0

new study *focused* on non-pharmaceutical interventions to stop flu
scientists found simple measures such as staying at home and avoiding social interaction can help in the event of a pandemic
in 2009 when swine flu was confirmed in @entity40 the government closed schools and introduced ' social distancing ' measures
scientists *monitored* its effectiveness by analysing tv watching patterns in the home and found initially it worked - but tailed off after time
