@entity0 was n’t overly worried when she saw a slight swelling on the neck of her nine - year - old daughter @entity3			1
she just thought @entity3 had swollen glands and was getting a cold			1
but a few days later a friend pulled @entity0 aside and voiced concerns			0
@entity0 thought her daughter @entity3 had swollen glands and was getting a cold , but instead the swelling was a sign of iodine deficiency ‘ he ’s a retired gp called @entity14 , and he told me the swelling was a sign of iodine deficiency , ’ says @entity0 , 31 , who also has a son , @entity12 , eight			1
‘ this was n’t anything i ’d thought of before			2
’ far from being as innocuous as a cold , a lack of iodine can have a major impact on physical and mental health for adults and children			2
studies show it is becoming increasingly commonplace in this country — up to two in three @entity31 girls and women are thought to have low iodine levels			1
the @entity34 ( @entity34 ) says iodine deficiency is the biggest worldwide cause of mental impairment			1
it has been linked to low iq , fatigue , miscarriage and problems with the thyroid — the gland in the neck that regulates metabolism and early development			1
since spotting @entity3 ’s goitre ( the name for a swelling at the front of the neck caused by iodine deficiency ) , dr @entity14 has noticed an increasing number of people in the street with goitres near his home in @entity58			1
these swellings are in the middle of the neck and will move up when you swallow			1
@entity63 is the only obvious sign of iodine deficiency and the result of the thyroid gland enlarging			1
this is because the job of this gland is to produce the thyroid hormone , which it does using iodine			2
but if the body is not getting enough iodine , the gland expands to try to produce more thyroid on its own			2
serious cases of iodine deficiency can lead to hypothyroidism ( an underactive thyroid ) — causing long - term health problems such as foggy thinking , memory loss and infertility			1
dr @entity14 says : ‘ i ’ve started looking at people ’s throats when i ’m out and about , and i ’ve discovered that quite a lot of people have goitres — the majority of whom are teenage girls			2
‘ when i was doing my medical training in the @entity94 , i was at a hospital in @entity96 in @entity97 and there were lots of people there suffering from goitres			0
' the biggest i saw was the size of a small melon			0
‘ but you do n’t expect to see many in the @entity31			1
it does make you wonder if there ’s some sort of deficiency problem here			2
’ ‘ @entity14 ( a retired gp ) suggested a couple of iodine drops from the chemist mixed in with squash once a week			0
within a month the swelling had gone and @entity3 stopped taking the drops , ' said @entity0 recent research also points to problems with iodine intake			1
one study , published in @entity123 last year , looked at iodine levels in urine samples from 100 pregnant women			1
expectant mums need more iodine than most people as its vital for foetal brain development			0
but two - thirds of the women in the study by @entity134 and @entity135 universities were iodine deficient			1
the children of these women had lower iqs by the age of eight and poor reading ability by age nine compared with those born to the mothers with adequate iodine			1
meanwhile , another study , in @entity123 in 2011 , involved more than 700 teenage girls from across the @entity31 and revealed 70 per cent of them had iodine deficiency			1
one in five had a ‘ very low ’ level			0
teenage girls need more iodine , too , for breast and ovary development			1
as a result of this study , the @entity153 placed the @entity31 on the list of mildly deficient nations			1
the @entity158 has now added iodine to its @entity160 , which checks the nutrient intake of adults and children in @entity31			1
it will look at the results next year and decide whether steps need to be taken to increase the nation ’s iodine intake			0
so why are our levels so low ? most of the world ’s iodine is found in the oceans — seafood , seaweed , cod and scallops are especially rich sources			1
but in the @entity31 , cows ’ milk and other dairy products such as cheese and yoghurt are our main source			2
this is due to a lucky accident : iodine is used as a disinfectant to clean cows ’ udders and added to their feed , so it has entered our food chain this way			0
but consumption slumped when free school milk ended in the @entity197			0
and it has fallen further in recent years due to allergy fears and our changing tastes			0
milk consumption has fallen further in recent years due to allergy fears and our changing tastes organic milk , which has grown in popularity , has around 40 per cent less iodine due to the different farming processes			0
dr @entity206 , the consultant endocrinologist at the @entity207 who led the 2011 research , says : ‘ in our study it seemed that the girls who were n’t having any milk were the ones who were losing a big part of their iodine supplementation			2
‘ before we did the study we thought we might be looking at iodine toxicity — too much iodine from milk — but the opposite was true			2
’ the recommended daily intake of iodine is 150 micrograms ( mcg ) for adults — 250 mcg for pregnant women			2
children should have around 120 mcg			0
a 100g portion of shellfish provides 90mcg , and a 200ml glass of milk has 50 - 80 mcg			0
so it ’s easy to see how shortfalls arise			0
the @entity31 @entity236 , formed by dr @entity206 , is pressing the government for a solution to @entity31 ’s deficiency			1
in many countries , including @entity243 , the @entity244 , @entity245 and @entity246 , salt manufacturers have been required to add iodine to their products since the 1920s			0
this is thought to be the simplest and most effective way of improving population - wide intake			0
recently , @entity34 added iodine to the salt in @entity256 to help improve levels there			2
but there are no plans to iodise salt here			0
‘ as soon as you even mention salt in @entity31 , people start talking about high blood pressure and strokes , ’ says dr @entity206			2
‘ that ’s why i think the government does n’t want to intervene , because it ’s always easier to leave the status quo			0
‘ it ’s ironic that we fund programmes to iodise the salt of @entity276 countries , yet we do n’t bother about our own			0
’ the @entity31 @entity236 believes we should prioritise efforts to boost the iodine intake of teenage girls — the mothers of the future			1
‘ you could say , “ why do n’t we focus on pregnant women ? ” but the problem is that only 50 per cent of pregnancies are planned , and you need your iodine and thyroid status to be good pre-conception , as the foetal brain develops in the first few weeks of pregnancy			2
‘ if you suddenly start taking iodine supplements when you ’re six weeks ’ pregnant , it might not be good for you			0
' your thyroid takes a while to adjust and it could harm it if you take too much iodine too quickly			0
‘ another argument for focusing on teenagers is a @entity300 study that found your brain does n’t finish forming until you ’re about 15			0
the drop in @entity31 milk consumption over the last decade ' they gave 12 year olds iodine for six months and it improved their mental functioning			1
’ so what should you do if you fear your iodine levels are low ? the usual test is via a urine sample			1
but dr @entity206 warns that this may not be accurate			0
‘ results vary widely according to recent diet so are not useful to assess someone ’s iodine status , ’ he says			0
if you have a goitre you should see your gp , who may refer you to an endocrinologist for thyroid assessment			0
adequate iodine supplies should reduce the swelling			2
dr @entity206 says the only way to ensure your iodine levels are adequate is to consume more milk and dairy products			1
‘ or you can add an over-the - counter potassium iodine supplement of 100 - 150mcg per day			0
’ yet when @entity0 took @entity3 to her gp to ask for an iodine supplement she was brushed off			1
‘ we were told that at @entity3 ’s age there are so many hormonal changes going on , the lump would probably go , ’ says @entity0 , who lives in @entity333 , @entity334			2
‘ but @entity14 suggested a couple of iodine drops from the chemist mixed in with squash once a week			0
’ within a month the swelling had gone and @entity3 stopped taking the drops			1
@entity0 now ensures her children have plenty of milk and iodine - rich food			0
‘ i count us very lucky that we have @entity14 as a friend			0
' if it was n’t for him @entity3 ’s iodine status would have gone unnoticed			1

@entity3 , 9 , had slight swelling on neck caused by iodine deficiency
two in three @entity31 girls and women are thought to have low iodine levels
these swellings ( goitre ) are in the middle of the neck
@entity63 is the only obvious sign of iodine deficiency
