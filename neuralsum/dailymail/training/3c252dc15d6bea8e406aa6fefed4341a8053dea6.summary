by @entity0 published : 06:18 est , 16 july 2013 updated : 09:41 est , 16 july 2013 a pair of @entity3 students have developed a new technology capable of turning anything into an @entity7 - style tablet computer			1
dubbed the ' next big thing in home technology ' , the system lets people transform normal objects , such as an envelope or a fridge , into a tablet using a projector , depth camera and a pc			1
the pair even showcased the @entity22 students ' technology at a research conference hosted by @entity24 at its @entity26 headquarters			1
mr @entity28 , pictured , checks the temperature on his front door before leaving his house the innovation was created by students @entity28 and @entity29 , both 25 , from @entity30			1
the software is called @entity42 and uses a projector , a depth camera and a pc to create interactive multi-touch displays anywhere and on anything			1
currently , the device , which is in a prototype phase includes all the technology in a rather bulky box that must sit opposite the object that the person wants to use as a tablet			1
it does not rely on any other computers or devices			0
the technology uses a high - tech projector to beam an image of an @entity7 , alarm clock , or any chosen device onto an object			1
a webcam see pixels in red , green and blue along with depth and feeds details of what a person is doing and their movement back to the user ’s computer			2
the computer then uses their software to work out where the user ’s fingers are and what they are doing within the projected image to carry out a user 's desired task			0
the innovative software is called @entity42 and uses a projector , a depth camera and a pc to create interactive multi-touch displays anywhere and on anything , such as this fridge this means a user could turn their bed into a high - tech interactive office and do a day ’s work without getting up			1
the pair said they are looking to develop their work commercially and are being supported by their university			0
they hope that with development , the box of tricks will shrink to the size of a smartphone			0
a promotional video the pair have filmed for @entity110 shows an alarm clock being turned off simply by the touch of a bed post and @entity115 news headlines running across the headboard			0
the pair showcased their invention at a @entity24 research conference in @entity120			0
the technology is used on a fridge , pictured the video also shows a plain envelope being used just like an @entity7			0
@entity28 said the beauty of the software package is that it makes building interactive projected displays quick and easy			1
he said : ' as our lives continue to ' go digital ' , we need interfaces that are able to integrate our digital world with our physical lives			0
' phones in pockets or screens on desks are not necessarily the best way forward because they are very restrictive in quite a number of ways			0
mr @entity28 ( left ) and mr @entity29 ( right ) aim to develop their @entity42 technology and have created their own company ' playing , changing and experimenting with these designs can completely change how people use computers and how they behave as a result			1
' our technology is designed to be is quick and easy to set up and it does not require a hardcore programmer or team to develop interesting content			0
' indeed , in the physical world , being able to make a bedpost glow is in some ways a more compelling interface than a button on an @entity157 app. ' he believes that the technology will one day be small enough to fit inside a light bulb			0
the engineers said : ' what is unique about our offering is that it is not about screens any more			0
we can create interactive furniture , objects and pretty much anything you can dream up			1
' the technology is used here to show the user , through words projected onto the sideboard , that the kettle is ready the pair of students , who have launched their own company , @entity179 , have made the beta release of their toolkit available online			2
mr @entity28 said : ' we are very excited by the potential we feel the toolkit and software we have developed has commercially			2
' it was fantastic to be asked to go over to @entity26 to show what we have to the people at @entity24			0
' while the pair acknowledge that the combination of project and touch interaction is not a new idea , @entity28 said that their offering moves the idea on ' dramatically '			2
creator @entity28 is pictured using the device on his bed			2
the students ' invention means you could turn your bed into a high - tech interactive office and do a day 's work without getting up			1
the pair said they can create engaging displays almost anywhere ' what is unique about our offering is that it is not about screens any more			2
' by leaving the world of glowing rectangles behind , we can create interactive furniture and objects ; beds , sofas and pretty much anything you can dream up			1
' ' we can create engaging displays pretty much anywhere			0

two *phd* students from the @entity30 have created @entity42 which can turn any object into a tablet computer
the technology uses a projector , a webcam and a pc to create interactive multi-touch displays anywhere and on anything
@entity28 and @entity29 plan on turning their innovation into a business
