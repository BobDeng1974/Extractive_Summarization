this series of brain scans shows the path a tiny parasitic tapeworm takes as it burrows its way through a man 's brain in the first case of its kind in @entity11 , the one centimetre long worm is seen travelling 5cm from the right side of the brain to the left over the space of four years			1
known as @entity16 , the worm which originates in the @entity17 , is extremely rare , with just 300 cases recorded worldwide since 1953			1
it causes inflammation of the body 's tissues known as sparganosis , triggering seizures , memory loss and severe headaches			1
very little is known about the worm , though it is thought people may be infected by accidentally consuming tiny infected crustaceans from lakes , eating raw meat from reptiles and amphibians , or by using a raw frog poultice as a @entity37 remedy to calm sore eyes			2
this series of brain scans shows a tiny parasitic worm burrowing its way through a man 's brain the case is the first of its kind in the @entity11			1
the images show the one centimetre long worm travelling 5cm from the right side of the brain to the left surgeons managed to successfully remove the worm , which they found was a benign version			1
had it been a more aggressive type , it could have laid eggs , which then feed off the brain as they grow			1
to identify the exact species of worm , surgeons at @entity57 's @entity56 in @entity58 , sequenced one particular gene			1
the so - called ' barcode of life ' revealed the parasite was the more benign of the two sparganosis - causing creature			2
but their research found the worm was resistant to current anti-tapeworm drugs and as more people travel to exotic destinations , the risk of becoming infected increases			2
in response @entity11 scientists examined its dna to spot weaknesses that can be targeted with other existing drugs			2
dr @entity79 from @entity57 's , said : ' we did not expect to see an infection of this kind in the @entity11 , but global travel means that unfamiliar parasites do sometimes appear			1
' we can now diagnose sparganosis using mri scans , but this does not give us the information we need to identify the exact tapeworm species and its vulnerabilities			2
' our work shows that , even with only tiny amounts of @entity76 from clinical samples , we can find out all we need to identify and characterise the parasite			0
' this emphasises just how important a global database of worm genomes is to allow us to identify the parasite and determine the best course of treatment			2
' additionally , this information can be paired with our work in global travellers ' infection to give additional insights in what infections other patients can get in specific destinations			0
' the study looked at discovering targets in the genome for existing licensed drugs which could prove to be the best way to treat this rare disease			0
this data could contribute to the growing global database for identifying parasites and identifying new treatments , according to the report , published @entity120			0
known as @entity16 , the worm which originates in the @entity17 , is extremely rare , with just 300 cases recorded worldwide since 1953 surgeons at @entity123 in @entity58 successfully removed the worm they identified it as the less aggressive of the species of worm			1
had it been the more aggressive type it could have laid eggs , which feed of the brain dr @entity132 , of @entity133 , said : ' the clinical histology slide offered us a great opportunity to generate the first genome sequence of this elusive class of tapeworms			1
' however , we only had a minute amount of dna available to work with - just 40 billionths of a gram			0
' so we had to make difficult decisions as to what we wanted to find out from the dna we had			0
' the researchers used the draft sequence to look for similarities and differences from other , previously sequenced , tapeworm species in the @entity150 pathogen database			0
this has revealed more about @entity16 's biology than ever before , for example , the worm has a large selection of molecular motors for moving proteins around the cell , which could underpin the large changes in body shape and environmental adaptions that the worm undergoes during its complicated life cycle			0
dr @entity164 of @entity165 of the @entity133 said : ' for this uncharted group of tapeworms , this is the first genome to be sequenced and has allowed us to make some predictions about the likely activity of known drugs			0
' the genome sequence suggests that the parasite is naturally resistant to albendazole - an existing anti-tapeworm drug			0
' however , many new drug targets that are being explored for other tapeworms are present in this parasite and could offer future clinical possibilities			0

surgeons at @entity123 in @entity58 removed the worm
the *1cm* long tapeworm burrowed 5cm from the right side to the left
it was the first case of its kind in the @entity11 - there have been 300 worldwide
it causes inflammation triggering seizures , memory loss and headaches
most aggressive type of worm lays eggs which feed off the brain
