by @entity0 president @entity1 last night claimed that the @entity2 had blocked 500 bills since 2007 as accusations of ' @entity2 obstructionism ' are making an election - year comeback			1
@entity1 and the @entity7 have been forced onto the offensive as they try to explain to their big dollar donors why they 've been unable to move forward on issues important to the base despite holding the upper chamber and the presidency			2
' their willingness to say no to everything — the fact that since 2007 , they have filibustered about 500 pieces of legislation that would help the middle class just gives you a sense of how opposed they are to any progress , ' president @entity1 told attendees of a @entity7 fundraiser on wednesday evening at the home of @entity34 chairman @entity33 in @entity35 , @entity36			1
the president said @entity39 ' behavior ' has actually led to an increase in cynicism and discouragement among the people who were counting on us to fight for them			2
' president @entity1 listens to the remarks of movie director @entity47 as he attends a @entity49 event in @entity35 on wednesday night			1
@entity1 made remarks at @entity7 fundraiser earlier in the evening , where he claimed @entity39 had filibustered 500 bills in the last seven years @entity1 is in @entity36 this week raising money for @entity54 ' re-election efforts			1
last night 's fundraiser was the first in a string of money - making events the president is shilling for his party at as they attempt to build up their war chest ahead of november 's mid-term elections			1
his ' 500 filibusters ' remark likely came from claims senate majority leader @entity67 has been making this week			0
' we ’re now at more than 500 filibusters , ' @entity67 said on wednesday			0
' they do everything they can to stop us from progressing in this country			0
' @entity67 was was referring to the number of times bills he 'd brought to the floor did not make it through the cloture process , a @entity75 staffer clarified on background , not the number of actual number of talk - a - thons @entity39 have had throughout the last seven years			1
a spokesman for @entity75 minority leader @entity86 characterized it as the number times any bill introduced introduced by either party did not make it out of the @entity75			2
' to get to 500 , you ’d have to include all the times during the same time period that then - sen. @entity1 voted to “ filibuster ” legislation and nominees , and all the times that @entity54 " filibustered " @entity2 bills , ' @entity99 communications director @entity98 told @entity102 in an email			1
' it ’s statements like those that keep fact checkers and late - night comedians in business			0
' the @entity111 , the ideological counterpart to one of the groups @entity1 was campaign for on wednesday , said it was the president who of standing in the way of legislation that would help @entity120 , not the other way around			2
maybe if president @entity1 spent less time jetting around the country for fancy fundraisers , and more time working with @entity125 , he could convince @entity54 in the @entity75 to start voting on the dozens of jobs bill that @entity127 @entity39 have passed and sent their way , ' @entity111 spokesman @entity122 told @entity102			1
' voters have shown time and time again they are looking for a pro-growth , pro-jobs agenda , but the @entity54 in @entity125 are simply refusing to listen			0
' also in attendance at last night 's @entity135 was honorary chair and famed director @entity47 , right			0
@entity47 as a major contributor to president @entity1 's re-election			1
he gave $ 1 million alone to a @entity139 the month before the november 2012 election throughout the 2012 presidential election , @entity1 referred to it as his ' last campaign ' because @entity120 presidents are limited to two terms in office			0
@entity1 admitted at wednesday 's event that he recently realized that was n't true and had to apologize to the @entity149 for inadvertently misleading her about how much time he 'd have to spend on politics in his second term			2
' a couple months ago , i had to let her in on a secret , and that is , honey , i got one more campaign i got to run , ' @entity1 said			0
' i need to make sure we continue to have a @entity7 senate , and i need a @entity7 @entity127 in @entity161			0
' both parties are desperate to win the @entity75 this year			0
if @entity39 successfully grapple the upper chamber out of @entity54 ' hands , president @entity1 would quickly become a lame duck president			1
' i 've got to have a @entity7 senate , ' president @entity1 told donors on wednesday			1
' and when you think about everything i was able to accomplish with @entity172 at the helm in the @entity127 , all the issues that you care about that we were able to advance when she was the leader , i think you ’ve got a big stake in making sure that we 've got a @entity7 @entity127 as well , ' he continued			0
@entity39 are not in danger of losing the @entity127 , and with control of the @entity75 , too , they could effectively halt the president 's agenda during his final two years in office			1
depending on how many seats @entity39 pick up in the @entity75 , the president could go from playing offense on issues important to progressives to playing defense			2
no more threatening to use his pen and phone - president @entity1 's only remedy to @entity2 - led initiatives would be to use his veto authority to send legislation back to the @entity127 and @entity75 , where it would take a super majority to overturn his decision			1
@entity1 could also move his agenda though executive orders , something he has not been shy about doing in the past			0
@entity1 took a break from fundraising to attend the dinner , where he received an award from the @entity47 , who created the foundation @entity39 are equally aware of what is at stake in november			2
senate minority leader @entity86 fired back on the @entity75 floor on thursday that the way @entity54 are acting is ' disgraceful			1
' ' instead of a forum for debate and resolution of the most pressing domestic and international issues facing our nation , it ’s become fodder for late - night tv , ' @entity99 charged			0
' when the @entity120 people turn on @entity220 these days , they do n’t often see a @entity221 driving serious debate on the issues of the day			0
they hear bizarre monologues about greased pigs and a couple of @entity227 the majority leader seems to see around every corner			0
they see a daily display of absurd political theater that has almost no relevance at all to their daily lives , ' the minority leader , who races a rocky road to reelection this year himself , continued			0
@entity99 was referring to senate majority leader @entity67 's barrage of attacks against conservative billionaires @entity243 and @entity244 , who are from @entity245 , and his claims that @entity2 senators are obstructing legislation at the @entity244 's behest			2
a poll recently showed that few @entity120 know who the @entity251 are , but name dropping the activists on the @entity75 floor has proven to be lucrative for @entity54 .			1

**democrats** are claiming @entity2 obstructionism is to blame for the @entity75 's *inability* to pass progressive legislation
at a @entity7 fundraiser last night , president @entity1 claimed @entity39 ' have filibustered about 500 pieces of legislation ' since 2007
the president 's number likely includes every single piece of legislation that has come through the @entity75 in that time - including legislation **democrats** opposed , a @entity75 staffer said
@entity39 are in turn calling on @entity54 to stop obstructing @entity2 - led legislation from coming to the @entity75 floor
