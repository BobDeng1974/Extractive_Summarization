@entity0 and @entity1 , once safely ensconced in the city whose name means ‘ @entity4 ’ , started to fight back after a bruising few days			1
@entity1 responded to claims that his tears during the penalty shootout win against @entity8 proved he was too emotional to captain @entity9 with a reminder of his successful battles on and off the pitch , which include fighting for his life when he spent six months in hospital with @entity16			1
@entity0 , in his own inimitable bar - room style , told @entity19 reporters to ‘ go to hell ’ if they did n’t like the fact that he leaked information to a select group of friends in the media			2
@entity9 have been under intense scrutiny since the nailbiting win against @entity8 , when they scraped into the last eight with good fortune , penalties and the lucky religious charm of the reserve goalkeeper , while the press officer has been charged by @entity51 for attacking one of the @entity8 team			1
no - one took more flak than @entity1			1
he seemed to be an emotional wreck during the shootout in @entity58 but his bond with @entity0 is strong			2
‘ he is my commander and he never went against me , ’ said @entity1			1
‘ i do n’t care what people think because no one knows me			2
i just think about my job			2
this is the way i am			2
i am emotional and it ’s a natural thing for a human being to be emotional			2
high spirits : @entity27 falls to the ground with a smile on his face as @entity32 , @entity34 and @entity71 look on eyes on the prize : @entity9 's @entity74 left back @entity32 balances the ball with the top of his hand ‘ it does n’t affect me at any time on the pitch			1
i think it helps me			2
people are saying silly things			2
i do n’t think it makes any difference			2
i have overcome many things in life			0
i fought for my life			0
’ perhaps it was the @entity90 factor which stiffened their resolve			0
it was in this northern city of 2.5 million that the extended a cappella national anthem was born during last year ’s @entity95			0
outside the stadium , 30,000 protesters were clashing in the streets with riot police as public opinion was turning against @entity40 largesse			0
inside , @entity0 ’s players locked arms and sang the anthem as they had never sung it before and , when the music stopped after the @entity51 - regulation 90 seconds , they sang some more , led by @entity1 and @entity34			1
they roared on , into the second stanza which includes the words : thou wilt see a son of thine flees not from battle			0
and the @entity113 fans , proud to have the team back in their city for the first time in more than a decade , went with them			0
@entity118 fit @entity27 points to @entity120 inspiration battle : @entity27 plays the ball on as @entity34 and @entity123 make a late challenge during training fever pitch : thousands of fans gather outside the stadium as @entity9 prepare for @entity40 quarter - final picture this : a @entity9 fan poses for a photo between cutouts of @entity27 and @entity34 it stirred the soul and soon became an established element of @entity0 ’s team			1
through the rest of the @entity95 , which they won , and into this @entity40 , the @entity19 sang the second verse of their national anthem without music			0
others followed , notably @entity145 nations with meandering anthems			0
it is a token of resistance to the 90 - second limit , another unnecessary @entity51 rule squeezing identity from the game , like the guidelines on team colours which have @entity155 and @entity156 playing in all - white and @entity157 in all - red			0
for @entity9 , however , the anthem is special : their very own haka ; a goose - pimpling pre-match ritual and display of unity ; a nation together behind the @entity9 in spite of everything ; a nation willing this flawed team to a sixth world title			1
whether it actually helps has been the subject of heated debate , fuelled when @entity0 summoned his trusted sports psychologist @entity175 to the team ’s mountain retreat in @entity178			0
‘ she is n’t paid , ’ rapped @entity179 ‘ they love going to talk to her , in a meeting or on the phone			0
’ good call : @entity27 , pictured during training on thursday , has been @entity9 's star man at the @entity40 not impressed : @entity9 coach @entity0 has told his team 's critics to ' go to hell ' @entity190 gathered for the idea of taking the captaincy from @entity1 and giving it to @entity34			1
‘ crying is normal , but he needs to stop , ’ said @entity193 , the last @entity19 to lift the @entity40			0
@entity195 talked about the weight of the @entity155 shirt but it can not compare to a nation of more than 200 million who will not be satisfied until the @entity202 defeat by @entity203 in 1950 is exorcised			0
the pressure is intense and no - one is under more than @entity27 , who spent 90 minutes fielding media questions			1
he also told @entity35 what it wanted to hear : a knee injury will not stop him playing			1
@entity41 have been in fluent form but they have beaten @entity9 only twice and not for 23 years and never on @entity19 soil			1
@entity9 have won seven of 12 since @entity41 ’s last win in the @entity214 in @entity8			1
the last four matches have been drawn and @entity0 told how he expects a more even game against a team committed to open and attacking football			0
‘ does @entity9 continue with a hand on the cup ? ’ asked @entity219 , before answering his own question			1
we are on the fifth step			0
our supporters do n’t expect anything different			0
’ it was fighting talk in @entity9 ’s fortress city .			1

@entity9 have been under intense scrutiny since nailbiting win against @entity8
captain @entity1 has been criticised for lack of mental *strength*
@entity27 says he 's ready for @entity41 clash despite knee injury
