@entity0 left the field a loser last october in his first ever @entity3 but on sunday night he walked off the pitch a man who had put the league title within touching distance of his team – some way to mark your first ever home game against @entity12			1
‘ that ’s why we paid a lot of money for him , he compliments what we already have , ’ said @entity13 of a performance and a goal that meant even though @entity12 had successfully subdued @entity16 they still lost the game			1
the @entity24 squad have plenty of players who float like butterflies , but at times over the last few seasons what they have really needed was someone who could sting like a bee – @entity0 did exactly that on sunday night			1
@entity0 celebrates after scoring for @entity24 in his first ever home match against @entity12 @entity0 gets the better of @entity12 pair @entity34 ( left ) and @entity35 to score for @entity24 on sunday it was n’t quite the 3 - 1 win that earlier in the season @entity12 inflicted on @entity24 – and that could still matter if the two teams finish level on points such is the head - to - head goal - difference rule in @entity43 – but it was still some performance and some win			1
and what a difference five months had made			0
that @entity3 was @entity0 ’s debut after his @entity48 ban for biting @entity49 had ended			2
he made an almost instant impact setting up @entity51 to score after just four minutes			0
he then laid another golden opportunity on a plate for @entity16 only to see it missed and @entity12 come back into the game and win it 3 - 1			1
on sunday night the impact was not so instant but it was lasting			0
@entity13 will also have made a note of how two other new signings who were both still bedding - in last october were also very important in the win			2
he had insisted on the club signing @entity64 keeper @entity63 and he was outstanding , making brilliant saves from @entity66 at both ends of the second half			0
@entity69 , meanwhile , was the unlikely scorer of the first goal			1
‘ i have been pushing myself to get my first goal for the club and finally it comes in the biggest game ’ he said			0
he was also outstanding defensively alongside an immense @entity75			2
@entity0 is crowded out during his first - ever @entity77 match at the @entity78 as @entity24 lost 3 - 1 in october defender @entity69 celebrates with his @entity24 team - mates after giving his team the lead @entity13 was questioned for requesting the signing of @entity69 – a 30 - year - old defender with a € 20m price tag was always going to have a hard job convincing supporters but sunday night ’s display will have gone a long way to doing that			1
for @entity0 the convincing had already been done with those two crucial goals at the @entity92 that made sure @entity93 were brushed aside by @entity24 in the @entity94			1
sunday night ’s finishing told supporters nothing they did n’t already know			0
there is a phrase – ‘ mig - toc ’ – coined by former @entity24 player and coach @entity99 which means ‘ half - touch ’ and is meant to describe @entity102 ’s passing game as something one step beyond one - touch			2
@entity0 is congratulated by his team - mates as his goal pushed @entity24 closer to the @entity111 title @entity0 has that same speed of touch , not in his passing , but in his finishing			1
the control and shot past @entity118 seemed to be part of one movement that happened far too quickly for the @entity43 keeper and @entity12 defender @entity34 to do anything about			0
he is not the first to score in his first @entity123			0
other big signings such as @entity125 , @entity126 , @entity127 , @entity128 , @entity129 , @entity130 and @entity131 all did likewise			0
not all their goals were worth @entity111 titles however			0
‘ there is still an eternity to go ’ said @entity135 after sunday night ’s game and while 10 matches is little more than a quarter of a season it is true that so much can still happen , especially as @entity24 must travel to @entity140 and @entity141 before the season ends			2
but @entity24 are now in control of their own destiny and in @entity0 they have someone absolutely determined not to finish second this season as he did last year with @entity148 .			1
