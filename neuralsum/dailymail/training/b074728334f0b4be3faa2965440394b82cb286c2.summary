by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 09:34 est , 21 october 2013 updated : 09:37 est , 21 october 2013 plans to curb parliament ’s expenses for food , travel and hotels have been condemned by @entity8			1
a £ 15 allowance for mps to eat dinner is set to be scrapped as part of a package of cuts which also include a ban on taking taxis before 11pm			2
but mps on the @entity18 have voiced concerns about the plans , claiming they are being stripped of the right to put in for expenses that most private sector companies would pay out for			1
complaints : @entity8 are unhappy at plans to curb allowances for dinner , taxis and hotels the @entity29 ( @entity30 ) says it wants to put the expenses system that applies to @entity8 on a footing with other professions			1
but the @entity18 claims it is unfair to end the £ 15 allowance which @entity8 can claim if the @entity36 sits after 7.30pm			1
the committee said it had ‘ no wish to return to the system in which members were allowed to make blanket claims ’ but said payments for food are commonly given to workers on business away from home			0
in a report the @entity8 said : ' if such expenses are not met by the employer , then the employee is able to claim tax relief on subsistence costs of travel between work places			1
the rules for @entity8 are already considerably less generous than this			2
‘ we also note that when there is whipped business , members must be within easy reach of the division lobbies			0
‘ once again , we consider there needs to be a stronger evidence base before it can be asserted that these are costs which other professionals would expect to meet for themselves , unless they had been dealt with through a salary supplement rather than expenses			0
’ fares : under the rules new mps would only be allowed to claim for taxis after 11pm the latest complaints about mps pay and perks comes amid reports that @entity30 's plans to give mps an 11 salary rise will be signed off within weeks			1
all three main party leaders have condemned the idea of a hike at a time when the rest of the country is suffering austerity			0
the organisation said the £ 4.6 million extra salary costs would be offset by restrictions to pensions , ‘ golden goodbyes ’ , and expenses - meaning the overall burden on the taxpayer would only go up by £ 500,000 when the deal took effect after the 2015 general election			0
among the changes planned to allowances are a halt to claims for tea and biscuits and ban on using taxis to get home before 11pm			0
salary : sir @entity106 , chairman of the @entity29 , has recommended increasing @entity8 ' pay to £ 74,000 hotels would only be allowable if they are booked after 1am and there would also be a crackdown on claims for running two homes , with some costs for tv licences and contents insurance no longer being met			1
the @entity18 said it was ‘ surprised by the suggestion ’ that some of the costs identified are of a kind which workers in other professional jobs would expect to pay for themselves			0
it said mps routinely worked 60 or 70 hours a week but since the new system of allowances had been introduced in the wake of the expenses scandal some had taken to sleeping in their offices			0
‘ we do not consider that @entity30 has made a case for changing the boundary of the existing scheme of business costs and expenses , ’ the report said			2
‘ the proposal to allow taxis to be claimable only after 11pm and hotels to be bookable only after 1am will have the greatest impact on members for constituencies within the @entity142 area , although the proposals for taxis may affect mps with accommodation within the inner @entity142 area , but some distance from @entity149			2
‘ we find it hard to believe that employers in other sectors would expect their employees to wait until 1am before booking a hotel if it was necessary for them to work beyond the point at which it was possible or sensible to return home and to travel to work in time to start as normal in the morning			0
’ while @entity8 ' pay is set to go up from £ 66,396 to £ 74,000 , the existing final salary pension scheme is to be downgraded to career average - as happened across the rest of the public sector some years ago – saving £ 2.5 million in the first year			1
prime minister @entity164 's official spokesman said : ‘ mps ' pay is a matter for @entity30			1
the prime minister 's view is that the cost of politics should go down not up			0

expenses *watchdog* also wants to stop mps claiming for hotels before 1am
@entity30 *argues* that parliament should behave like any other employer
it comes ahead of *decision* to *rubber* stamp @entity8 ' pay hitting £ 74,000
