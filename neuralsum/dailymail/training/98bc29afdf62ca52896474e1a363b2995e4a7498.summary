middle class jobs are under grave threat from advances in technology , a former senior adviser to @entity5 is warning			1
white collar posts in areas such as law , medicine and accounting are increasingly being replaced by computers , according to @entity12 , an @entity13 strategist			1
he warned politicians were ‘ all over the place ’ in their responses to the squeeze on the middle classes and were failing to address the ‘ actual causes ’			2
@entity12 , an ex-no 10 strategist , pictured , said jobs in areas such as law , medicine and accounting are increasingly being replaced by computers jobs are being created at the bottom end of the income scale – in areas such as retail and social care – and at the top , but too few in the middle , mr @entity12 , who is now chairman of the @entity32 , a national campaign to promote computer science and technology skills , told the @entity36			1
he pointed to the example of the @entity39 factory in @entity40 , which produces more than 500,000 cars a year and is one of the most productive in @entity43			0
its use of modern robotics means it employs only about 6,000 workers , far fewer than would have been needed just a few decades ago			0
in @entity49 , the electronics firm @entity48 recently announced plans to buy an ‘ army ’ of more than a million robots to replace most of its human workers			0
‘ take legal services - text - analysing and data - mining software is doing the work of paralegals , or the accounting profession , in which algorithms are taking over from human auditors , ’ he added			2
in the future , driverless vehicles are already being tested – which will eliminate many more jobs , while computers were also being used to diagnose medical conditions and carry out stock - market trading			2
mr @entity12 said the government urgently needed to do more to prepare middle - class people for jobs in it and technology - a key growth area driverless vehicles are already being tested for the future , which will eliminate many more jobs , while computers were also being used to diagnose medical conditions and carry out stock - market trading			1
mr @entity12 said the government urgently needed to do more to prepare middle - class people for jobs in it and technology – a key growth area			1
‘ this is either the biggest threat to jobs in the @entity87 or it ’s the biggest opportunity , ’ he claimed			1
he said the trend had ‘ profound implications ’ for society			0
‘ if you look at the @entity87 and look at the @entity94 , there is a stagnation in middle class incomes			1
‘ there are more jobs at the top and more jobs at the bottom , but fewer in the middle			1
@entity97 blames the government , the government blames it on other people			0
really what ’s affecting it is technology replacing white collar jobs in the way that it replaced blue collar jobs back in the 70s , 80s and 90s			1
mr @entity12 pointed to the example of the @entity39 factory in @entity40 , which produces more than 500,000 cars a year but employs just 6,000 staff ‘ if a tough place to be in the 80s was working in a manufacturing job , today if you ’re working in a lower level job in a law firm or an accountants increasingly you ’re seeing those kinds of jobs replaced by software			1
’ he said the government urgently needed to do more to prepare middle class people for jobs in it and technology – a key growth area			1
‘ look at where most jobs have been created over the last five years : lots in residential care , in face - to - face retail – which are not jobs that can be replaced by technology			1
but the next biggest category is it and technology			2
‘ that ’s a real source of optimism here			0
the average it job pays £ 20 an hour , well above the average wage			0
there ’s a chronic shortage of trained computer scientists and software workers in the @entity87 , ’ he said			0
‘ that ’s why the government is having to create a tech talent visa , to bring these sorts of people in from abroad			0
at the last @entity160 summit , @entity158 said it 's ' a race between computers and people ' ‘ the internet economy is already over ten per cent of @entity87 gdp and it ’s growing by 20 per cent per year			0
the question for us is how can we make sure @entity87 people benefit from this trend and do n’t lose out from technology replacing old jobs			1
‘ that ’s entirely about skills			0
it ’s about getting computer coding into the curriculum , which we are the first @entity179 country to do			0
’ mr @entity12 said there was ‘ so much more that needs to be done ’ , calling for more tech and it apprenticeships and adult training			1
‘ you can absolutely learn very quickly the skills you need to get a job in the technology industry at any age , ’ he said			2
‘ this is either the biggest threat to jobs in the @entity87 or it ’s the biggest opportunity			1
’ @entity193 , managing director of @entity194 , said : ‘ in the late 19th and early 20th centuries , advances in technology mainly involved more powerful and productive machines that nevertheless needed to be operated by humans			2
later came machines which effectively replaced human labour			0
‘ simultaneously , though , new jobs appeared using human brain power			2
when computers came along , they started to substitute for various humdrum mental labours while leaving more complex tasks still in the field of the human			0
we are now on the brink of a change that will see machines take over these , too – hence a second " machine age "			0
’ @entity158 , head of @entity213 , said at the last @entity160 summit of world leaders and economists : ‘ it 's a race between computers and people — and people need to win			0

@entity12 says more should be done to prepare middle class for it jobs
ex-no 10 strategist says jobs are under threat from advancing technology
he says positions in law , medicine and accounting are most *vulnerable*
