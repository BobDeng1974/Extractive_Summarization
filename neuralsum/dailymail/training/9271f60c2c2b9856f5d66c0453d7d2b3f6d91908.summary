in the small @entity2 city of @entity3 , locals assume the name of their football club is a nod towards the tropical cyclones that batter the @entity9 coast at this time of the year			1
spend 30 minutes in conversation with the man who doubles as manager and director of football at @entity14 , though , and you could be forgiven for believing the team were named after him			1
ask @entity18 — formerly of this manor — about his hopes and ambitions for the fledgling @entity23 side and he speaks in calm , measured tones			1
@entity18 ( right ) argues with the fourth official during his time in charge of @entity29 in 2012 yet , when the topic turns to his first love , you appreciate it is maybe no bad thing that 10,000 miles currently separates him from @entity36			1
if absence does indeed make the heart grow fonder , then what the 47 - year - old has witnessed from afar over the past four years has threatened to break his			1
one of just three players to have featured in every one of the nine - in - a - row seasons , @entity18 now barely recognises the emaciated beast a once proud club has become			1
‘ it ’s really sad			2
it breaks my heart sitting over here and seeing what ’s going on , ’ he tells @entity45			2
‘ it actually makes it more frustrating when you are so far away			2
’ distance and a sizeable time difference have proven no barriers to one of the club ’s great midfield war horses keeping up to speed on the whole sorry saga			2
but it ’s long since got to the stage where flicking on the tablet for a daily update is an act undertaken with considerablme trepidation			2
like the vast majority of @entity68 supporters , as far as @entity18 is concerned , there is no ambiguity as to where the blame for the current shambles lies			1
‘ we just want our club back and for it to be in good hands , ’ he states			2
‘ at this moment in time , it ’s not in good hands			2
‘ every single day , you look online and it ’s story after story after story — each one more negative than the last			0
‘ you just wonder what these guys ( in the boardroom ) are doing			0
do n’t treat the @entity68 fans like idiots because that ’s one thing they are not			1
they know the game and what ’s going on here			0
‘ they wo n’t stand for mediocre people in the club			2
’ @entity18 is now the manager and director of football at @entity14 in @entity2 an £ 850,000 capture from @entity97 in 1988 , it was @entity18 ’s good fortune to join @entity68 at the outset of an unprecedented period of dominance in the @entity103 game			1
and yet , as a lifelong supporter of the club , he needed no one to point out the folly in taking the good times for granted			2
before the arrival of @entity111 as player / manager in 1986 , the @entity36 outfit had been also - rans in the @entity113 since 1978			1
under @entity115 in the early 80s , crowds often struggled to reach five figures — the kind of paltry numbers no one inside the club ever thought they ’d witness again			2
‘ you always thought : “ this is @entity68 ” and it would never fall so far			1
not in a million years , ’ @entity18 reflects			1
‘ when you see @entity68 playing to an 11,000 crowd ( against @entity127 ) , when is the penny going to drop ? it ’s just diabolical			1
‘ not so long ago , they were getting 50,000 every second week			0
what the hell has been going on for it to reach this point ? ’ the question is rhetorical			0
@entity18 knows well the whole sorry story involving sir @entity136 , @entity137 , @entity138 , the @entity140 brothers and @entity141			1
a catalogue of self - inflicted wounds by the so - called custodians of the club			1
a general view of @entity36 during the @entity148 match between @entity68 and @entity127 on sunday that the scale of the mess is nuclear is beyond dispute			1
the pertinent question now is what happens to clean it up			0
‘ i think the whole place needs a total clear - out from top to bottom			2
we ’ve got to start afresh , ’ @entity18 muses			1
‘ the board just do n’t listen			0
i hope that ( @entity162 ) @entity161 and the @entity163 get in and the shareholders vote this board out			0
they are treating @entity68 fans and shareholders with total contempt			1
‘ why are they taking this egm to @entity171 ? is it to prevent people coming down and voting ? ‘ if it is , they really are vastly underestimating @entity68 fans			1
they are sick and tired of what ’s happening			0
‘ how can these guys believe that they are doing a good job ? ‘ what is it they do n’t understand ? they are not liked or wanted			0
@entity68 fans want them out and people who will bring the club forward in			1
‘ whether that takes another four , five , six years , then so be it			2
that ’s what we have to do			0
’ while @entity18 holds the men at the top ultimately responsible for the mess beneath them , they are not the only targets of his considerable ire			1
a man who seemed born to play in @entity197 matches , he tuned on his television a week past on sunday to watch the @entity199 semi-final with @entity201 far more in hope than expectation			0
he was wise to approach the game with pessimism			0
not only did @entity68 fail to progress , they failed to lay a glove on their great rivals			1
@entity18 ( left ) pictured with @entity209 after @entity68 won the @entity210 in 1988 for @entity18 , not even managing to ruffle @entity201 ’s feathers was entirely unacceptable			1
‘ they should at least have a bit of pride and passion , ’ he adds			0
‘ it was the first @entity197 game for three years and the boy ( @entity219 ) @entity218 was right — it was probably the easiest derby win in history			2
‘ it was heartbreaking to see a @entity68 team lose so easily			1
‘ do n’t make excuses			0
i ’ve heard the boy @entity226 making plenty about the referee bottling it and not sending @entity218 off			0
he got intimidated , bullied and his backside kicked			0
it ’s as simple as that			0
‘ then i see someone else ( @entity232 ) saying they wanted to play @entity201 in the @entity148 because they wanted another crack at them			0
‘ he should have been worrying about beating @entity127 first			0
‘ there are absolutely no excuses for what they ’ve been turning in on the park			0
’ there is , however , boundless sympathy for @entity242			0
a team - mate of @entity18 ’s when @entity97 won the 1987 @entity148 , the caretaker manager presently looks like he ’d rather be working in @entity246 salt mines			1
‘ the fact @entity248 is working his notice tells you a story about him , ’ @entity18 says			1
‘ he has basically had enough and has n’t been able to do what he wants			0
‘ i ’m reading in the papers that this guy @entity254 told @entity248 to play these ( @entity256 ) players and then @entity254 comes out and says he never			0
he ’s basically calling @entity242 a liar			0
@entity18 ( left ) on the ball during a match between @entity68 and @entity201 at @entity260 in 1989 ‘ i know who i believe			1
i ’ve known @entity248 for a number of years and he does n’t shirk out of decisions or anything he ’s been told to do			2
‘ if he does n’t agree with something , he ’ll tell you			0
but these guys are putting that much pressure on him			0
‘ it ’s a shame he ’s landed the job in these circumstances			0
it ’s the same with @entity209			0
‘ the club is in such a sad , stricken way			2
i do n’t think any other manager has had to put up with what these guys have had to and i really feel for them			2
’ @entity209 , like @entity18 , is now watching matters unfold from afar			1
does the latter believe the @entity36 icon — and the club at large — missed a trick three years ago by not flooding the first team with youth ? ‘ i do n’t think it was a missed opportunity , ’ he insists			1
‘ there are still kids coming through but are they ready to play for @entity68 ? ‘ do they understand what it means to play for that club and the pressures that brings ? ‘ some people handle pressure differently			1
not everyone can handle it			0
some just get on with it			0
‘ the @entity113 next season is going to be a really tough gig for those kids			0
’ that is , of course , assuming @entity68 get there .			1
