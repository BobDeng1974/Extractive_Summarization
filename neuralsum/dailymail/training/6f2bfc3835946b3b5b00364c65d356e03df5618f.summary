' he was a good , well - liked , hard - working bobby who did his best to support the community , ' mr @entity137 said			1

he will be sorely missed			0

' he was n't the type to get into trouble – if anything i would guess he had stepped in and tried to solve a problem			0
he was a really good character			0
they kept their lives very private			0
to be honest you would never have known he was a police officer			2
' i just feel for @entity118 now , and how she copes without him			2
it is such a shame			0
it is such sad news			0
' last night police said anyone with information should contact @entity32 police on freephone 0800 230 0600 or @entity190 on 0800 555 111			0
