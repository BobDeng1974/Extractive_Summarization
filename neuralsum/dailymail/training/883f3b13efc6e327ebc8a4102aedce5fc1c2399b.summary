unhappy : @entity0 , 35 , is preparing to sue @entity1 for discrimination claiming he is pulled over without justification ' all the time ' @entity6 's brother last night claimed police have stopped him 25 times simply because of the colour of his skin			1
@entity0 says he is the victim of a sustained campaign of harassment by @entity1 officers			1
and his lawyers yesterday lodged a damaging race discrimination complaint against the @entity16			2
they say the 35 - year - old teacher has been repeatedly pulled over in his car for ' no apparent reason and without any justification '			2
his patience snapped after an incident on november 16 near the home he shares with his fiancée and two - year - old son in @entity27 , south @entity28			1
mr @entity0 , whose brother was killed by a racist gang , was in his @entity31 when two officers stopped him			1
after asking why he had been pulled over , he says one of the officers replied that he had been ' naturally suspicious ' of him			2
mr @entity0 , whose plans to sue the @entity16 were revealed by the @entity37 on saturday , said : ' i am being targeted because of the colour of my skin , i do n't think it 's because i am @entity6 's brother			1
' whenever i have been stopped , i have never subsequently been charged with anything , and nothing has ever been found to be wrong with my car			2
' i have never , ever , done anything wrong			2
i have never been in trouble with the law			0
i have paid my road tax and my insurance , and always tried to keep my cars in a roadworthy state			0
' of the 25 or so occasions in which i have been stopped , only two have been at police checkpoints – where they are verifying people 's tax and insurance			1
the rest have been random stops			0
' in a statement , he added : ' there can be no other reason , apart from racism , for me being stopped so often			1
' if i had no road tax , no insurance , or if i was driving erratically , i would understand being pulled over			0
but on no occasions was that the case			0
' a letter of complaint was sent to @entity1 chief @entity70 yesterday afternoon , outlining details of mr @entity0 's ordeal and the names of the officers involved in the latest incident			1
in it , his lawyers warn of further legal proceedings and state that over ' many years ' he has been stopped between 20 and 25 times			2
because of the extraordinary sensitivity of the case , there is speculation that the @entity85 will be asked to supervise an inquiry into the allegations			0
the legal move will be of particular concern to home secretary @entity90 , who last month paid tribute to the campaigning work of @entity0 and @entity6 's mother @entity93			1
brothers : @entity0 ( right ) pictured at home with his elder sibling @entity6 ( left ) , who was murdered family : murdered teenager @entity6 's mother @entity98 ( left ) and her son @entity0 ( right ) pictured at a memorial held in his honour in april last year @entity102 : the boys ' mother @entity103 who has long campaigned to rid the police of racism in 1999 , the @entity16 was accused of being ' institutionally racist ' by the judicial inquiry into her son 's murder six years earlier			1
the 18 - year - old @entity113 student was killed by a group of white youths as he waited at a bus stop in @entity117 , south - east @entity28			1
two of that gang , @entity6 and @entity6 , were jailed for life last january for @entity6 's murder			1
mr @entity0 said last night : ' i feel angry and frustrated because i sat through the trial of @entity6 and @entity6 , and saw some of the mistakes made by police in 1993 and the years that followed			1
' now it appears not much progress has been made in how they deal with black people			0
i just want police to do their jobs properly			0
i do n't want them to waste time on people like me			0
their time could be better spent elsewhere , rather than pulling me over			0
home secretary @entity90 ( left ) has paid tribute to the campaigning work of @entity103			2
mr @entity0 sent a letter of complaint to @entity16 commissioner @entity70 ( right ) outlining his concerns remembered : a police cctv surveillance van at the site of the @entity6 memorial stone in @entity117 , south - east @entity28 ' they could be out solving crimes			1
a lot of recommendations were made by the @entity148 but it seems that it has n't made much difference			0
' i would like to know when things are going to change , when is there going to be a society where you are not pulled over because you are a black guy or a black person driving a particular car			0
the decision to stop someone in their car should be based on a sound reason , rather than the colour of your skin			0
' i have met some really good police officers who work hard to protect the community			0
' but it only takes a small handful of people with the wrong type of attitude to make it feel like things have not changed since the @entity148			0
' he said that as he grew up in south @entity28 , being regularly stopped by police was something he ' reluctantly accepted '			1
' but as i am getting older now , the circumstances in which i am stopped are more ludicrous and more over the top , ' he added			2
' i saw the mistakes made by police in 1993 and the years that followed			0
not much progress has been made in how they deal with black people			0
' @entity0 ' in recent years , i have been stopped during my lunch - break at work			1
the police were checking tax discs			0
i have also been stopped on my first day back to work after the summer holidays , which meant i was late for the first briefing meeting for work			2
' on this occasion , i was pulled over randomly just before i got to the traffic lights			0
' i explained this to the officer , that i was on my way to work , but he insisted on going through the process of checking who i was , and checking my car was taxed , insured and in good working order			0
' i have reservations now about the type of car i can drive because i do n't want to increase the amount of times i am stopped			2
' mr @entity0 's solicitor @entity204 said : ' stop and search is often used as a litmus test for how the police treat those from minority ethnic communities			1
' @entity0 's experience shows that rather than passing this litmus test , the @entity16 have remained consistently bad			1
' @entity0 has suffered immeasurably over the last 20 years			1
first with the murder of his brother in 1993 , then the failures of the police in their investigation into the murder and to cap it all being unfairly stopped because of his skin colour			1
' previously @entity0 has not complained or otherwise drawn attention to what has happened to him , but now , when the metropolitan police seemingly trumpet how things have changed for the better , he has felt the need to take action			1
he has now instructed me to use the full force of the law			0
' the @entity16 declined to comment last night .			0

@entity6 's brother @entity0 , 35 , left furious by harassment
final straw said to be when he was stopped in @entity28 in november
mother @entity98 says ' racism has not gone away '
