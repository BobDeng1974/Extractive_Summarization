by @entity0 published : 06:25 est , 9 january 2014 updated : 06:41 est , 9 january 2014 @entity3 intelligence officers feared that terrorists would create an online avatar of @entity6 to continue to preach the @entity9 leader ’s message for centuries			1
a study predicted that jihadists would use images and recordings of @entity6 to put together new speeches and fatwas which would be broadcast online even after his death			2
its theories also included terrorists infiltrating virtual reality worlds such as @entity23 or online role - playing games such as @entity25 to recruit new members			1
fearing a fake : a 2008 report by @entity3 intelligence officers ponder that terrorists would create an online avatar of @entity6 by putting together and rehashing old images and speeches the report was written for the @entity34 in 2008 , but had not been released to the public until this week			1
it concludes that it is ‘ likely ’ that virtual worlds would be used to spread propaganda , train new members , and even find prospects , but that there was little evidence of such activities at the time of writing			0
‘ imagine that jihadist supporters create a detailed avatar of @entity6 and use his many voice recordings to animate the avatar for up - close virtual reality experiences that could be used to preach , convert , recruit , and propagate dogma to the media , ’ the confidential study says			1
‘ the @entity6 avatar could preach and issue new fatwas for hundreds of years to come , as the fidelity of his likeness would be entirely believable and animated in new ways to keep him current and fresh			2
’ fantasy theories : the study predicted that jihadists would use role - playing games such as @entity25 to recruit new members and spread propaganda ' as of this report , there is little evidence that militant @entity72 and jihadist groups have begun extensively exploiting the opportunities presented by virtual worlds			1
' however , [ ... ] they will likely soon seek to exploit newer virtual world technologies for recruiting , raising and transferring funds , training new recruits , conducting reconnaissance and surveillance , and planning attacks by using virtual representations of prospective targets			0
' the 142 - page study , titled ' @entity86 : where @entity87 ' , was published by @entity88 , a secrecy expert and researcher for the @entity90 , who obtained it through a @entity94 request			0
however , @entity88 told @entity95 , that ‘ the purpose of the study was to stimulate unconventional thinking ’ which is why , he added , some theories can be seen as outlandish			0
@entity6 was the founder of @entity101 , the terrorist organisation behind the 9/11 attacks , and several other violent acts of terrorism			0
he was killed in may 2011 after he was tracked down by @entity3 intelligence in @entity107 , @entity108			1
a @entity3 special forces military unit carried out @entity111 , ordered by president @entity112 , and @entity6 was shot dead during the raid of his compound			2
the news of his death was welcomed across the world , however the @entity3 operation was condemned by the @entity120 , @entity121 and the @entity122 and pro-bin @entity6 rallies were held by @entity72 groups in @entity108 , @entity126 and @entity127 .			0
