@entity0 's top three failed to produce big scores but @entity13 carried them through with 76 and , having won the opening match by 93 runs thanks to @entity16 's century , they appear well set to complete a series clean sweep in @entity19 on sunday			1
@entity21 players celebrate after the dismissal of @entity1 batsman @entity23 @entity24 ( right ) looks on after being dismissed as @entity0 wrapped up a series win against @entity1 @entity1 , though , had started well and @entity6 glanced @entity9 's leg - side loosener for four as seven came from the first over			1
@entity30 's first ball brought a loud lbw appeal against @entity8 but he survived and the batsmen 's partnership passed 50 in the 12th over			0
the last ball before drinks saw @entity8 launch @entity36 for six but @entity6 was first to his half - century , from 63 balls when he hit @entity39 for his fifth four to also bring up @entity1 's century			1
he was uncharacteristically dropped by @entity41 at mid-off before @entity8 followed him to 50 , from 60 balls with four fours and a six			0
it all changed , though , when @entity6 pulled @entity36 to mid-wicket to depart for 61 and @entity9 returned to have @entity8 caught at point for 65			2
@entity0 batsman @entity49 strikes the ball on the way to scoring 29 runs captain @entity53 was run out for 15 and @entity24 made just five before becoming @entity9 's second victim , again with the first ball of a spell			1
@entity57 hit @entity58 for six and @entity39 for four but was then caught off the latter , chipping straight to @entity9 for 29			2
@entity60 and @entity61 contributed only two apiece and debutant @entity62 was run out without scoring - as was the lumbering @entity23 to finish the innings			0
@entity62 nearly had a wicket in each of his first two overs , but replays showed @entity69 's edge dropped short of @entity24 before a leaping @entity70 was unable to cling on to @entity49 's sweep			0
@entity72 made 14 before being given out on review after edging @entity23 to keeper @entity8 , who also caught @entity16 for 12 off @entity74 to leave @entity0 39 for two			2
@entity1 batsman @entity8 receives encouragement from @entity6 after he scored half a century but it was not enough to prevent @entity1 slumping to 215 all out @entity1 batsman @entity53 hits the ball before being run out for just 15 runs in the one - day international @entity49 fell for 29 when a lusty blow was only prevented from going for six by the presence on the boundary of the @entity83 , who took a good catch			1
@entity13 had made only two when he edged @entity62 to slip and was dropped by @entity24 but he and @entity41 put on 85 for the fourth wicket to all but make the game safe			0
@entity13 crashed @entity60 for six and his 56 - ball half - century also featured six fours , and he added two more off @entity62 in the next over			0
@entity41 was run out superbly for 28 by a direct hit from @entity6 but @entity13 reached 76 from 81 balls before being caught off a top edge			0
@entity91 announced himself with a four and a six in succession off @entity62 and with seven needed from six overs , @entity30 finished the job with back - to - back boundaries .			0

@entity0 *strolled* to victory to move 2 - 0 ahead in series with one to play
@entity9 took three for 40 as @entity1 collapse to 215 all - out
@entity0 will target clean sweep in final match in @entity19 on sunday
