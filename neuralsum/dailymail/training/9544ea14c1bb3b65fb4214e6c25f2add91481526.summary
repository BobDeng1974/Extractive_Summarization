some of the very first cells to form life on @entity2 could be hiding on the moon			1
this is according to @entity6 scientists who believe evidence of the origins of life may be trapped beneath ancient lunar lava flows			1
they claim the molecules were flung towards the moon during the @entity14 - a time when @entity2 was bombarded by asteroids , and chunks of its material were thrown into space			1
some of the very first cells to form life on @entity2 could be hiding on the @entity22 is according to @entity6 scientists who believe evidence of the origins of life may be trapped beneath ancient lunar lava flows			1
pictured is an artist 's impression of the @entity2 as viewed from the lunar surface ' unlike the @entity2 , the moon has been geologically quiet for billions of years , meaning there is a good chance these organic and volatile records remain relatively intact , ' @entity32 from @entity33 told @entity34 at @entity35			1
life began on @entity2 around four billion years ago , but the planet 's geologic record only goes back 3.8 billion years			1
the cells and molecules that formed before have been erased through plate tectonics			2
scientists want to find them as they could provide crucial evidence to how organic molecules transformed into life systems			1
in april , physicists tested what would happen if rock containing microscopic fossils from @entity2 were to be fired into space and smash into the lunar surface			2
none of the fossils survived perfectly intact in the @entity55 study , but being able to recover anything at all was still promising for the scientists			0
the scientists claim the molecules were flung towards the moon during the @entity14 - a time when @entity2 was bombarded by asteroids , and chunks of its material were thrown into space the latest study , however , shows that these fossils can survive and now researchers are attempting to find out exactly how long			1
' we think a lava flow might be a good way to do that , ' professor @entity32 told @entity35 said			0
the @entity33 team heated a range simple organic compounds and complex polymers up to 700 Â° c in a vacuum			0
they also added @entity77 - 1 - a synthetic mixture of minerals the mimic 's the lunar surface			0
without @entity82 , the organic materials were destroyed			0
but in its presence , they were able to survive the intense heat			0
however , so far , no one has found an @entity2 meteorite on the moon			1
professor @entity32 said that if scientists found a series of lava flows with terrestrial meteorites inside , they could find the first appearance of recognisable life			1
researchers from @entity98 ( @entity98 ) in @entity99 have attempted to solve one of the paradoxes of the origins of life			0
they say that complex life could have gained a foothold in hydrothermal vents ( stock image shown ) in the early @entity2 , billions of years ago one of the great mysteries shrouding the origins of life on @entity2 is how complex organisms began to take shape			2
theory should hold that ' short ' fragments of genetic material would have reproduced in abundance , leaving longer strands - and thus complex life - behind			0
but new research has revealed that longer strands may have thrived in volcanic ' pores ' on the young @entity2 - ultimately allowing life to evolve to the complexity we see today			2
the research was carried out by a team from the @entity98 ( @entity98 ) in @entity99 and published in the journal @entity125			0
they found that water - filled micropores in hot rocks may have acted as the nurseries in which life on @entity2 began			1
one crucial precondition for the origin of life is that comparatively simple biomolecules must have had opportunities to form more complex structures			0
these , in turn , had to be capable of reproducing themselves , storing genetic information in a chemically stable form			0
creating longer strands of @entity141 to store this genetic information would have been essential - but it simply would n't have been possible in most conditions on @entity2			2
but @entity98 physicists led by dr @entity146 showed experimentally that pore systems on the seafloor that were heated by volcanic activity , namely hydrothermal vents , could have served as reaction chambers for this @entity141 .			0

cells may have been flung to the moon in @entity14
this is a period when @entity2 was bombarded by a series of asteroids
scientists want to find these molecules and cells as they may provide evidence to how organic molecules transformed into life systems
however , so far , no one has found an @entity2 meteorite on the moon
