i do believe that there is a basis for a resolution			0
' ultimately , @entity2 said , he sees ' a new opportunity to make progress in @entity42 , ' and ' believe [ s ] we can reach a comprehensive solution			0

' the @entity68 , an influential news clearinghouse website , pointed out after @entity2 spoke that he had , in the same press event , both announced his negotiation with @entity42 over its nuclear program and insisted that he would refuse to negotiate with @entity74 lawmakers in @entity75 over a budget deal for the 2014 fiscal year			1
