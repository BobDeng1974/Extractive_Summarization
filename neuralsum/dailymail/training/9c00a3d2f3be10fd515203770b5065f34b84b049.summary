a vigilante speed campaigner has been sacked by police for catching ' too many motorists ' after he trapped more than 40,000 drivers			1
@entity5 , 69 , and his team of volunteers at @entity8 caught around 1,600 speeding drivers every month in the @entity11 towns of @entity12 and @entity13			1
the group use hand - held speed cameras by the side of the road and then pass on the information police , who can then issue a warning letter to offenders			1
@entity5 , 69 , was sacked from volunteer role at @entity8 after he caught ' too many motorists ' but he claims his relationship with the force began to deteriorate when he was told he could only report less than 500 motorists a month			1
police told him staff could only process 2,000 cases across the whole country , so he would have to let some drivers off			1
but the decision led to increasing tensions between the two parties before the former @entity36 engineer was dismissed by the force			1
mr @entity5 , from @entity12 , said : ' the police believed that we would exceed the resources of the business support unit			1
' the fear of the police was that if we continued to issue 1,500 letters a month than we would prevent other schemes in the country from issuing their letters			2
' we were basically letting speeders off			0
we would go with an extra 10 people who had been doing 45mph in a 30 zone but they would n't go over the quota			0
mr @entity5 and his team caught 40,000 speeding drivers in the @entity11 towns of @entity12 ( pictured ) and @entity13			1
their technique was to set up cameras at the side of the road during rush hour ' in the end because i kept going on at them i got a bit of a reputation but basically we were a victim of our own success			0
' because we were turning in these high numbers and they were so accurate they became suspicious that something was going on			0
' he added : ' i basically got sacked for doing a good job and being too accurate			0
' we were thorough and professional and we had a pride in what we were doing			0
i 'm ex-armed forces and i always do everything by the book			0
the volunteer scheme @entity80 was rolled out by several police forces across the country to help educate people about speeding on the roads			2
it currently manages 647 trained volunteers distributed across 88 local @entity80 groups			0
volunteers operate at the roadside in areas with 20 , 30 and 40 mph limits , monitoring speeds with the aid of a portable speed indication device ( @entity95 )			2
they record and report the speed and identifying details of vehicles travelling at or above nationally - specified speed thresholds ( 25 , 35 and 46mph respectively )			2
vehicle checks are undertaken by the police and letters sent to the registered keepers advising them of the speed and reminding them of why it is a community concern			2
it is a form of education rather than enforcement , however , if problems persist enforcement can be undertaken by the police @entity102 teams			0
people wishing to set up the scheme in their area have to be prepared to fund it , which can cost up to Â£ 3,000 for the equipment			0
' they are experts and they are professionals but none of them have " kerb - side " with us so they do n't know what they are talking about			0
' mr @entity5 had been coordinator of the volunteers since 2010 and his team increased the accuracy of their speed detectors using the same technology as the @entity129			1
they clipped on a wooden sight similar to those used by airmen to pinpoint the dropping point for the bouncing bombs designed by @entity136 used in the dams raid			0
he said his volunteers caught more motorists than any other scheme in the county because they targeted drivers at rush hour			1
mr @entity5 now plans to set up his own independent group and has complained to the @entity145 ( @entity145 ) sir @entity146 about his treatment			1
a spokesman for the @entity145 said they had written to the chief constable and asked him to respond to the claims			2
but @entity152 has said mr @entity5 's position became ' unsustainable ' as he was ' unable to share our vision of education '			1
a police spokesman said : ' as a force , we support the great work of our @entity162 volunteers , and the work they do to help us educate drivers to change their behaviour through high visibility deployments in areas of community concern			2
' we have 155 groups across the county - all made up of local volunteers , and we continue to work with those groups to make the county 's roads safer			0

@entity5 , 69 , caught around 1,600 speeding drivers every month
team of @entity181 volunteers use hand - held speed camera at roadside
police told him to let some motorists off as it could only process so many
it led to increasing tensions and mr @entity5 was dismissed from role
he *intends* to set up own independent group and has complained to @entity145
