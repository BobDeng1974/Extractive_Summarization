by @entity0 it ’s 40 times more aerodynamic than a @entity2 , has a top speed of 90mph , and generates enough power to light the average home			0
and while it might not look anything like it , this strange design is in fact a pedal - powered bike enclosed in a aerodynamic carbon fibre shell			1
dubbed the @entity13 , the bike is being designed by a team of @entity16 engineering students who believe it will become the fastest human - powered vehicle in history			1
what is this strange design ? while it might not look anything like it , this unusual vehicle is in fact a pedal - powered bike enclosed in a aerodynamic carbon fibre shell the @entity27 @entity26 ( @entity28 ) are hoping their design will break the 83.13 mph ( 133.7kph ) record set in september 2013 by @entity31 and @entity33 universities			1
@entity13 will be designed , manufactured and ready to race by may 2015 , and will attempt the record in september 2015 at the @entity34 in @entity35 , @entity36			1
‘ this is no ordinary bicycle you would see cycling up and down the high street , ’ team leader @entity37 , 22 , told @entity38			0
‘ the rider is positioned almost lying down , as close to the ground as possible			0
this style of cycling is known as “ recumbent ” cycling			0
an aerial view of the @entity13 at the early design stage ( left ) and a view of the current design ( right ) the bike is encased in a lightweight carbon fibre shell with the rider cycling in a near - horizontal position			1
the design of the @entity58 exterior shell uses the same science used in the design of aircraft wings – adopting an inverted ‘ teardrop ’ shape to cut through the air as easily as possible			0
the vehicle emits zero carbon emissions , weighs less than 55lbs ( 25kg ) , is 98.4 per cent efficient and will travel at almost double the current sprint cycling record			2
the rider will be just five inches ( 13 cm ) from the floor and will need to generate over 700 watts of pure human power to get to top speed			1
it ’s 40 times more aerodynamic than a @entity2 , has a top speed of 90mph ( 145kph ) , and generates enough power to light the average home			0
the team said they will reveal more secrets about their design in the near future			0
‘ the whole bicycle is enclosed in a lightweight carbon fibre shell , giving the vehicle a streamlined shape which allows it to cut through the air more easily			1
‘ the unusual shape of the @entity13 ’s exterior shell improves the aerodynamic behaviour of the vehicle as air resistance is the biggest challenge to maintaining speed			2
the design uses the same concept as aircraft wings adopting an inverted ‘ teardrop ’ shape to cut through the air as easily as possible			0
‘ the frontal area of the vehicle is as as small as possible , seating the rider in a l position as low to the ground as possible ensures that air resistance is further minimised , ’ said mr @entity37			2
the rider will be just five inches ( 13 cm ) from the floor and will need to generate over 700 watts of pure human power to get to top speed			1
@entity13 emits zero carbon emissions , weighs less than 55lbs ( 25kg ) , is 98.4 per cent efficient and will travel at almost double the current sprint cycling record			1
close shave : the rider will be just five inches ( 13 cm ) from the floor and will need to generate over 700 watts of pure human power to reach top speed move over @entity2 : the bike is 40 times more aerodynamic than a @entity2 ( pictured ) , has a top speed of 90mph ( 145kph ) , and generates enough power to light the average home @entity117 , head of transport at the @entity119 , said : ‘ to get to the speeds they intend to , the team will have to make sure everything is perfect , from the vehicle ’s aerodynamics to the size of its wheels			1
‘ it ’s an extremely tough ask to get a human powered vehicle to travel at 90mph ( 144kph ) – and a leap into the unknown – but with the right engineering approach it is possible			0
‘ the bike also needs to house a rider , a frame and a transmission system powerful enough to allow the vehicle to reach the tremendous speeds required to clinch the world record			2
‘ the project is no simple undertaking , but at this stage , after just six months on the project , we are in a great position , ’ said mr @entity37			0
speeding bullet : the unusual shape of the @entity13 's exterior shell improves the aerodynamic behaviour of the vehicle as air resistance is the biggest challenge to maintaining speed			2

@entity13 is being designed by @entity27 students
they are hoping design will break 83.13 mph ( 133.7kph ) record next year
