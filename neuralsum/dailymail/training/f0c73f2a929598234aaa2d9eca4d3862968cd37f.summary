a glossy video that features baby jesus gurgling in his manger has been released today in an attempt to win back the festive season from some of the @entity7 's biggest names			2
the advert - which shows a modern family transform into @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity1 - is supported by leading @entity13 groups , who hope to remind the @entity16 public of the real meaning of @entity18			1
the 45 - second clip comes in the wake of a series of high - profile adverts from retail giants including @entity24 , @entity25 's and @entity26 - all that lay claim to the magic of @entity18			1
family : the 45 - second clip , which was uploaded to @entity31 this morning , starts with a man and woman sitting in their living room - their baby in a wicker basket on the carpet in front of them true meaning : the roaring fire and twinkling decorations of the room are stripped away , and the man and woman go from wearing @entity18 jumpers to robes - their infant child now lying in a manger but organisers of new video say that it is not twinkling fairies , @entity56 chocolate bars or a penguin love story that lies at the heart of the season - it is the story of the birth of @entity1			1
the hope is that the video , which is part of a wider campaign called @entity18 starts with @entity1 , will go viral - much like the @entity7 offerings that have come before it			1
@entity67 , head of the @entity18 starts with @entity1 campaign , said : ' the supermarket ads , which were released last month , offered a feel good take on christmas designed to influence consumers into spending money with them			1
' but they all avoided any reference to the religious meaning of the season			0
we thought it was time to produce the @entity18 ad which the supermarkets are unable to make – one which shows where the feel good factor comes from			2
' we are asking people to watch it , judge for themselves and share it with friends			0
' the clip starts with a young couple sat in front of their christmas tree - their infant child in a wicker basket on the floor in front of them			0
as a choral rendition of the @entity102 plays , the roaring fire and twinkling decorations of the room are stripped away , and the man and woman go from wearing @entity18 jumpers to robes			0
in a matter of seconds , the sumptuous living room is transformed into the stable in @entity109 where @entity1 was born - and the giggling baby is now lying in the manger in a bed of straw			1
it ends with the words @entity18 starts with @entity1 and the hashtag # @entity117 - inviting viewers to share the video , and their responses , on social media			1
while @entity13 groups have previously funded joint billboards , posters and radio adverts to invite people to attend church , it is the first time that they have paid for a video advertisement as part of a social media campaign			2
and , costing just £ 10,000 to make – one seven hundredth of @entity24 's @entity18 campaign – the advert 's budget is in keeping with its conservative message			0
the @entity136 , the @entity137 and @entity138 , are among the churches and @entity13 charities that are supporting the video , which was uploaded to @entity31 this morning			0
@entity142 , general director of the @entity137 , said : ' despite the attempts of our leading supermarkets , the magic of @entity18 does not lie in celebrities singing about turkeys , nostalgic chocolate bars or happy penguins			0
' there really has to be more to @entity18 than a battle between @entity25 's , @entity24 and @entity26 – or between @entity153 and @entity154			0
' the " @entity18 starts with @entity1 " video ad takes viewers to the moment where @entity18 began			2

advertisement released to remind people of the true meaning of @entity18
shows modern family become @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity1 in @entity109 stable
comes after series of high - profile tv adverts from @entity7 retail giants
