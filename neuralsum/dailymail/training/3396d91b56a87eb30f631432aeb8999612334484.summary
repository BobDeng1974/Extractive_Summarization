by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor the wife of a @entity4 minister has hit back at criticism of mps using taxpayers ’ money to employ family members			1
@entity10 , the wife of foreign office minister @entity11 , said she should not have to defend her job earning up to £ 40,000 as an office manager , insisting it was ‘ legally allowed ’			1
it comes after new figures showed 155 mps – nearly one in four – now have wives , children and even parents on the public payroll			2
family affair : @entity10 , who earns up to £ 40,000 working for @entity4 mp husband @entity11 , has hit back at criticism of relatives being put on the public payroll the taxpayer paid out £ 4million in salaries to @entity17 ’ relatives last year , up from £ 3.5million in 2010 - 11			1
among senior @entity29 enjoying the perk are justice secretary @entity31 , transport secretary @entity32 , chief whip sir @entity33 and environment secretary @entity34			2
the latter two are millionaires and earn more than £ 130,000 a year			1
mr @entity11 first employed his wife 30 years , after he was elected as mp for @entity38 in 1983			1
he lost the seat in the 1997 election , but was elected mp for @entity42 in 2001			0
mrs @entity10 insisted she worked hard managing ‘ a little team of four and a half staff ’ , for a salary listed by the commons expenses watchdog as being between £ 35,000 and £ 40,000			1
the mother - of - two complained of the ‘ odd hours ’ involved in the job , but rejected criticism that @entity17 should not be allowed to put family members on the public payroll			1
@entity11 first employed his wife 30 years , after he was elected as mp for @entity38 in 1983			1
the 58 - year - old trained as a solicitor , and married @entity10 in 1983 - the same year he entered @entity55			1
he rose to become social security minister under @entity57 , but he lost his seat in the new @entity60 landslide at the 1997 election			0
he was re-elected mp for @entity42 in 2001 , becoming deputy chairman of the @entity4 party in 2008 and joining the @entity63 as @entity65 minister after the coalition was formed			0
the couple have a son and a daughter			0
‘ my husband employed me 30 years ago			0
should i have to defend myself every single day			0
probably not , ’ she told @entity71			0
‘ ' i 'm not sure i have to defend it at all			0
it is what it is			0
we are legally allowed to be employed by our partners or whoever			1
‘ when you read the newspaper reports it says " propping up personal household income "			0
if it was anybody else it would say " working for a salary "			0
’ the number of mps declaring that they have family members working for them increased by 17 per cent after new rules were introduced increasing budgets for staffing			1
but mrs @entity10 insisted : ' it infers that somehow we are not doing a job			1
i think it 's done so much because it ’s very practical			0
they work odd hours , the hours have changed			0
‘ it 's obviously particularly strange because @entity11 is a @entity63 minister so he is constantly travelling			1
‘ most of his travel at the moment starts on sundays so he has to be quite often heading to airports in the middle of a sunday morning			0
‘ it 's two - centre working			0
it 's most weekend working			0
you do n't actually have many jobs which have quite such oddly structured hours and i think that 's why families find it quite useful			0
' she went on : ‘ we work wherever we are whenever we need to , as opposed to fitting into some structure of office hours , i think that 's why it 's popular			1
‘ constituents can phone at any time of the day and night - and they do , and that 's fine , we provide that kind of service in the office because we can			2
if somebody wants to ring me up at seven o'clock on a sunday morning to say there 's something wrong , they can and that 's ok			0
‘ we do have a hectic schedule ... i 'm not moaning , it 's what we do			0
we love what we do			0
it 's a fantastic way of life , it 's a fantastic job , we enjoy the public engagement			0
‘ but i really do n't see why i should spend my time defending the fact that somebody pays me to do the 37 - and - a - half hours in the office every week			2
’ hectic : mother - of - two mrs @entity10 said it was ' hectic ' running a team of four and a half staff covering her husband 's constituency work travel : mr @entity11 ( centre ) often has to leave the house on sunday mornings to fly around the world , in his role as a minister under foreign secretary @entity154 ( right ) an mp who employs her daughter at taxpayers ' expense claimed she would be earning ' less than the minimum wage ' if her hours were taken into account			1
@entity162 , the outspoken @entity4 , defended hiring her daughter @entity163 as a constituency caseworker on a salary of £ 30,400			1
she said that the 26 year - old provided ' value for money ' as she worked weekends and could always be relied on			2
the mp said on @entity169 : ' given the hours she works , she would argue , very strongly that she is on less than minimum wage and abused , ' adding a smiley face			1
the bill for @entity17 ’ expenses rose by an inflation - busting 7 per cent despite @entity176 ’s pledge to bring down the cost of politics			2
the 17 per cent rise in family employment reflects a rule change that allows mps to spend more on staff and , by using relatives , top up their household income			1
in 2011/12 they were allowed to claim only £ 115,000 a year for staff			1
but that was increased in 2012/13 to £ 144,000 for @entity190 mps to reflect higher costs in the capital			2
other mps claim up to £ 137,000			2
expenses – office outlays and personal costs such as travel and accommodation – were up from £ 91.5million in 2011/12 to £ 98million , according to the @entity199			1
spending is now higher than in the run - up to the expenses scandal of 2009			2
@entity204 of the @entity205 ’ @entity203 said : ‘ any politician using taxpayers ’ money to employ a relative must be completely open about who is being paid , how much and for what			0
‘ and in the light of past abuses , they should n’t be surprised when their constituents demand more openness if they fail to give a detailed explanation as to how they are spending that cash			0
’ the public outcry over mps employing family members began in 2008 , when @entity4 mp @entity222 was accused of paying his two sons for non-existent jobs			1
calls for the rules to be changed intensified after the expenses scandal broke a year later			2
other ministers who employ relatives include @entity230 from the @entity63 , business minister @entity231 , @entity232 at the @entity233 , and @entity235 minister @entity234			2
justice secretary @entity31 ( left ) employs his wife as a senior secretary on £ 39,999 , while sir @entity33 , the chief whip , employs his daughter @entity238 as a senior parliamentary assistant on £ 34,999			1

@entity10 insists she is ' legally allowed ' to earn work for husband @entity11
she earns up to £ 40,000 - a - year as office manager overseeing *4.5* staff
even though @entity234 expenses are under *scrutiny* , family fill even more roles
many mps use their wife as an assistant , secretary or office manager
mp @entity162 claims her daughter works for less than minimum wage
