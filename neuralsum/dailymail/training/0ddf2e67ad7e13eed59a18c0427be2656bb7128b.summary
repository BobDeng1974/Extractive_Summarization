she is battling her late father 's relatives , claiming she was the victim of a ' conspiracy ' to cut her out of inheriting more than £ 500,000 a woman claims her father ’s relatives conspired to cut her out of a £ 500,000 inheritance because she ‘ shamed their family ’ by being born out of wedlock			1
@entity2 says her father ’s siblings ‘ never liked her and did n’t want to know her ’			1
the mother of two claims her half - @entity20 father , @entity21 , ‘ treated her like a princess ’ and promised she would never have to worry about money again after he died			1
but when mr @entity24 died of throat cancer in 2011 , aged 65 , mrs @entity2 , 40 , was shocked to find he had signed a will on his deathbed			1
that left the bulk of his £ 620,000 estate – including his home in @entity32 , north @entity4 , and a flat in @entity34 – to his sisters @entity36 and @entity37 , his brother @entity38 and the children of a third sister , @entity40			1
mrs @entity2 , who is her late father ’s only child , wants the @entity3 to rule the will invalid and hand mr @entity24 ’s entire fortune to her			1
she told the court how her paternal grandfather , @entity24 , was a top @entity20 diplomat who lived in @entity4 and married an @entity46 girl , setting up home in @entity48 and raising their four children			0
she said this auspicious upbringing led to her father ’s siblings feeling ‘ shame ’ and ‘ unfounded hostility ’ when she was born illegitimate			2
mrs @entity2 , of @entity55 , told judge @entity56 she had to take a dna test following her father ’s death to ‘ prove her heritage ’			1
in the will she was left £ 100,000			1
but mrs @entity2 insisted that on her wedding day her father promised her his worldly goods and she ‘ fears the will is in fact a forgery ’			1
she claims @entity40 and @entity36 , together with their cousins @entity70 – the executors of the estate – were ‘ part of a conspiracy to fraudulently propound an invalid will ’			2
they deny those accusations , along with claims the siblings exerted ‘ undue influence ’ on their dying brother to get him to make the will			2
mrs @entity2 told the court : ‘ i contend that the siblings took advantage of my father ’s admission to hospital and indisposition by making and arranging the will			2
‘ if he did sign the will , he was compelled to sign any document put before him , without ever knowing the full and real contents of it or its implications			0
‘ the circumstances around the making of the will raise suspicion			0
it was made when my father was admitted to hospital and the siblings were told he had seven days to live			0
the next day he signed the will , effectively excluding his only daughter , directly contrary to previous discussions with me			0
ms @entity2 's cousins @entity70 - a magistrate and executor of the will - and @entity110 outside @entity4 's @entity3			2
she accuses the pair of taking part in the conspiracy against her ‘ i believe that there is a suspicion or doubt that this will was invalid and hope the court will reach the same conclusion			0
’ @entity119 , representing mr @entity24 ’s siblings , said the way the will divided the assets was ‘ perfectly understandable ’			0
he added the £ 100,000 gift to mrs @entity2 , far from being shocking , ‘ reflected his favourable treatment of his daughter during his life ’			1
cross-examining mrs @entity2 , he said : ‘ he was getting tired of giving you money			1
’ mr @entity119 told the court : ‘ the will is rational on its face			0
the evidential burden is upon mrs @entity2 to raise a real doubt about capacity			2
it is submitted that she has clearly failed to discharge that burden			0
‘ there is certainly no evidence that raises even a prima facie case that the @entity141 , @entity36 and @entity40 have forged or falsely propounded the will or conspired to commit forgery			0
‘ the @entity141 are both respectable members of society			0
it is inherently unlikely that two such individuals would come to court to lie			0
sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0

@entity2 , 40 , family ' never liked her and did n’t want to know her '
she says they have ' forged her father 's will ' which only left her £ 100,000
claims he had promised her his entire estate once he died
but family say he had simply grown ' tired of giving her money '
