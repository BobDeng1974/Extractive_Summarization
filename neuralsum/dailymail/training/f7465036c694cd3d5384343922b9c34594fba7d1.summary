a husband who rented a billboard in an attempt to find his wife a new kidney says he is reminded of her every time he drives by the sign he rented to try and save her life			1
@entity10 's wife @entity9 , from @entity11 , @entity12 , was on a transplant waiting list , before the couple decided to take matters into their own hands			1
they decided to head out onto the highway where mr @entity10 climbed up onto the board to paint their message			2
wanted : a @entity12 couple decided to take matters into their own hands			0
@entity24 , 73 , and her husband @entity23 , 70 , rented a billboard on @entity26 in @entity27 , to advertise @entity9 ’s plight for a new kidney experienced : @entity10 , a @entity30 veteran and former mural painter , borrowed a 12 - foot ladder and painted ' i need a kidney ' along with his phone number on the white billboard tedious : @entity24 had been in and out of hospitals since she was diagnosed with bone marrow cancer in 2008 , and since 2009 she had been on dialysis because the cancer treatment damaged her kidneys on an overcast morning last december , @entity10 parked his truck on the side of @entity26 , gathered a few supplies and headed over to a blank billboard he had leased a day earlier , at a discount from a friend			1
mr @entity10 , a @entity30 veteran and former mural painter , borrowed a12 - foot ladder and painted ' i need a kidney ? ' along with his phone number			1
' we decided it was worth a try , ' she said			0
' it was so cold when he was on the ladder			0
the ladder was unstable because the ground was uneven			0
i was in the pickup , ready to call 911 if he fell off			0
although his wife died just a few weeks ago , his cause and effort to find his beloved a transplant was a valiant one			2
mrs @entity24 had been in and out of hospitals since she was diagnosed withbone marrow cancer in 2008 , and since 2009 she had been on dialysis			0
@entity10 dedicated himself to learning everything there was to know about kidney donations			1
hoping : numerous people came forward looking to donate a kidney but none of the offers crystallized last chance : @entity10 painted the sign last december			1
he climbed a ladder and began painting the sign he hoped would save his wife ’s life new lease : the sign , and everything that followed it , seemed to rejuvenate @entity9 , who had borne years of treatment			1
she seemed to get great joy out of her conversations with callers , making at least one new friend @entity92 : for all the calls they received , for all the kind words and prayers and encouragement , no concrete leads materialized and @entity9 passed away in september a final goodbye : in september , @entity9 ’s health took a turn for the worse			1
@entity10 told her how he felt about her but held out hope when @entity9 began using a home dialysis system , he learned how to help operate it , and when home dialysis was no longer possible , he drove her 65 miles round trip to the hospital in @entity108 , three times a week , so it could be done there			1
between treatments , he tried to keep her as comfortable as possible			0
he made up a little bed in the backseat of the couple 's car , with pillows and blankets , and drove her to one of the local fairs in 2010 she began considering a transplant and the search for a potential donor began			2
she was then approved for a transplant in february			0
but the search for a matching donor was n't easy			2
@entity9 had type o blood , and she can only receive a kidney from a donor with the same blood type , in the months before her death , numerous people got in touch hoping to help out , but none were a match			1
several volunteered to be her donor but none were acceptable candidates , others called to let @entity10 and @entity9 know that they were thinking about them , praying for them			1
most , though , offered their own kidneys , assuming it was feasible			0
' one of the people , who is a perfect blood match , had had tuberculosis , so they were unable to donate and the other phone calls have been the wrong blood type , ' she said			2
' we have had a great number of phone calls , ' she said			0
' it is an impulsive thing , offering to give your kidney			0
we have been very grateful			0
it was a wonderful response and our community has been very supportive			0
' in the weeks after the sign went up , it all seemed possible			0
@entity10 started to feel like his idea might actually work and that it was only a matter of time before the right person saw it			1
the sign , and everything that followed it , seemed to rejuvenate @entity9 , and she enjoyed chatting with callers			1
' she was her old self again , ' @entity10 says			2
' just chipper and positive - thinking , and just upbeat			0
' but days turned into week and weeks turned into months			0
no regrets : in the weeks since the funeral , @entity10 had tried to come to grips with the loss			2
he still blames and wonders if there was something else he could have done to save his wife 's life moving on : the sign on the @entity26 is gone and so is his wife , but he is left with a lifetime of happy memories @entity10 pursued any option he could think of			1
he wrote letters to universities that were on the cutting edge of kidney research			0
he called different institutions , trying to get @entity9 into experimental programs but it made no difference			2
in september , @entity9 's health took a turn for the worse and after coming down with a fever and chills she passed away one fall afternoon			1
as @entity10 come attempted to come to terms with the loss of his wife he keeps wondering if there was something more he could have done			1
his message on the sign is gone now			0
he parked his truck on the side of @entity26 to paint the sign away			1
as he did so , he wiped the tears from his eyes , thankful for the time he and his wife got to spend with one another , grateful for the kindness of strangers , and happy thinking of the times that will live long in the memory			1
