@entity0 will kick off their summer transfer business by securing the free transfer signing of @entity3			1
at first glance it may seem like the @entity7 club are falling into the same traps that characterised their previous ill - fated stint in the top - flight			2
paying top dollar for over-hyped stars , only in @entity14 for one last pay day			0
for this read @entity17 and @entity18			2
out with the old : @entity3 left @entity19 on a free transfer this summer following 12 years service done it all : @entity3 enjoyed a trophy laden career at @entity19 , including winning the 2008 @entity24 but with the capture of @entity3 , you 'll have to dig a little deeper			1
yes , @entity3 is 35 - years - old , and yes he has very little to prove after a trophy - laden career at @entity19			2
but where @entity3 differs from @entity17 et al is that he actually actually cares			2
can you see @entity3 laughing as he trudges off the pitch just minutes after his side were relegated from the @entity34 ? not a chance			0
his long - lasting relationship with manager @entity37 would see to that			0
@entity3 knows he owes much to @entity37 for giving him his chance at @entity40 as a teenager			1
and now the pair are reunited at the twilight of his career , @entity3 has the chance to repay @entity37 for giving him his big break at @entity47			2
in @entity3 , @entity0 have someone who will make every single member of the squad a better player			1
not only by what he does on the pitch on saturday , but simply by just being there			0
flops : @entity18 ( left ) and @entity17 could not help prevent @entity0 getting relegated in 2013 no laughing matter : @entity17 was caught laughing seconds after @entity0 were relegated from the @entity34 in 2013 , as @entity0 boss @entity37 followed having someone of @entity3 's stature in and around the club 's @entity59 will only serve to enhance their training sessions			1
for instance , if @entity0 's pursuit of @entity64 central defender @entity63 proves successful , then who better than @entity3 to help nurture the former @entity69 man 's talents ? @entity3 's a leader in every sense of the word , and @entity0 will only benefit from his experience			1
it is , of course , unlikely that @entity3 can play an entire 38 game @entity34 season			0
with a string of injuries and over 700 career appearances to his name , playing twice a week maybe be a stretch too far			0
but when he is available , rest assured @entity0 's back - four will be better for it			0
mutual respect : @entity37 helped start @entity3 's professional career while manager at @entity40 back in the big time : @entity37 guided @entity0 back into the @entity34 at the first opportunity after winning the @entity90 play - offs in may while @entity37 has been desperate to push through his move for @entity3 for weeks , there has been some hesitation from the powers that be at @entity7 about his signing			1
once bitten , twice shy and all that			0
they still have lingering reminders of the over-spending that has threatened the financial stability of the club			0
@entity102 , who earns £ 80,000 - per - week , is still contract to the club ; as are @entity103 and @entity104 , who both earn in excess of £ 60,000 - per - week			0
but taking a former @entity108 international , @entity34 and @entity24 winner on a free transfer , for 12 months on a basic wage of around £ 50,000 - per - week seems pretty low risk business			1
and this time next sure @entity0 ' money men will be laughing over their reluctance to complete @entity3 's transfer .			1

@entity0 set to make @entity3 their first signing of the summer on free transfer from @entity19
former @entity108 defender will reunite with @entity37 who he played under at @entity40
hoops have been stung with similar transfer *market* captures in the past with @entity17 and @entity18 flopping at @entity7
