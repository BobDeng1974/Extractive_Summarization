it ’s no secret that the nation ’s dogs are facing an obesity crisis			0
but experts yesterday warned they are also in ‘ behaviour meltdown ’ because humans are so clueless when it comes to looking after them			0
the @entity8 ( @entity8 ) said millions of dogs are becoming fat , and aggressive because their owners have a ‘ grave lack of understanding ’ of their basic needs			1
vets say that lack of exercise is contributing to a ‘ shocking ’ rise in behavioural problems – with people and other pets on the receiving end of bored , anxious and badly trained dogs			1
many of our 8.1million dogs are being killed with kindness , with treats including beer , chips and leftover takeaways making them dangerously overweight and triggering diabetes , heart disease and arthritis			1
the problem is being exacerbated by lack of exercise			2
almost one in three - which equates to 2.4million dogs - are not allowed to run off the lead every day			1
and almost one million are never taken for a walk at all			0
@entity8 senior vet @entity56 said too many people purchase dogs on a whim , without thinking about how much exercise the particular breed needs			1
dogs are also falling foul of the long hours worked by their owners – and their increasingly sedentary lifestyle			0
with one in three dogs overweight , vets are predicting there will be more fat pets than slim ones in just five years ’ time			2
the @entity8 says that lack of exercise is contributing to a ‘ shocking ’ rise in destructive and aggressive behaviour – with people and other pets on the receiving end of bored , anxious and badly - trained dogs			1
the charity ’s annual @entity30 report estimates that there are a quarter of a million incidents a week in which dogs behave aggressively towards people			1
and more than half of vets have noted an increase in dog on dog attacks			0
@entity8 head of pet health and welfare @entity94 said : ‘ we are undoubtedly a nation of animal lovers , with four out of five pet owners stating they feel physically or mentally healthier because of their pet			2
' however , our latest findings reveal that anti-social behaviour in dogs continues to rise due to a worrying lack of training , socialisation and exercise			1
‘ owners are sadly continuing to feed the wrong types of food with portion sizes out of control			0
preventative health is also a major concern – the basics such as vaccinations and neutering are often ignored by owners , leaving their pets vulnerable to a wide range of deadly diseases			0
’ the @entity8 commissioned @entity121 to quiz 1,069 dog , cat and rabbit owners , plus almost 600 vets and veterinary nurses			2
it wants people to take part in its online @entity130 so that it can gather even more information			0
