by @entity0 a team of feral pig hunters are using technology to win their boar war by sending up remote control airplanes fitted with heat seeking cameras to guide them towards their prey			1
the wild beasts are a serious problem in @entity12 's deep south where they cause around $ 1.5bn worth of damage to crops and wildlife every year			1
exterminators at @entity18 are often charged with the task of tracking the pigs and killing them before they roam onto the next farm and wreak more havoc			2
hunters at @entity18 pose with another successful haul , thanks to their trusty radio plane the team use aerials to beam pictures back to ground where hunters are waiting for instructions to shoot but the animals are experts in going unseen , often raiding crop fields in the dead of night			1
due to their illusive nature @entity40 and his partner @entity41 at the hunting company have had to take special measures to catch up with their prey			0
they use a radio - controlled airplane equipped with a thermal - imaging camera as a spotter which can then inform a human hunter on the ground			1
the method has proven so successful that @entity40 estimates his team have killed roughly 300 wild pigs in the last six months alone			0
@entity40 and his team of night hunters are so in demand that farmers will pay them a price per pig killed black heat spots on the map show pigs eating a farmer 's crops in a field under cover of darkness the hunters use images like this one to direct their troops towards the unsuspecting prey in the black of night he said : ' obviously it ’s not completely new technology , but some of the sensors and computing power has gotten to such a state to where it ’s very easy to build these things , have them last a long time and for them to have a little bit of brains ' now in his third hunting season , @entity40 's idea stemmed from his love of model planes			2
the hunter say that using planes has given them the upper hand , allowing them to kill 300 in the last six months the nocturnal pigs are less cautious at night having getten used to being able to raid farmers ' fields the scene may look like a blood sport , but wild boars can destroy acres of crops in the @entity12 south ' the aircraft is certainly capable of going thousands of feet , but generally the working altitude is 400 feet ' @entity40 , 36 , told @entity104			2
' and it ’s hard to say whether it will be business , but i know people who are making their living doing this			0
' the system he uses is far from military grade , in fact , but anyone wishing to recreate his system will have to spend a serious amount			0
this control centre allows the person steering the plane to communicate with other hunters with two screens , the controller is able to see where his plane is headed and what the map below is showing his aircraft is worth about $ 2,000 whereas the camera attached can cost upwards of $ 10,000 and beyond			1
he recoups some of that money by charging a kill rate on the amount of pigs he kills , which is $ 25 per pig			0
' whoever ’s got the most pigs and the most money , that ’s where we ’ll be			0

@entity18 track pigs with thermal imaging camera on a plane
while an operator flies the aircraft hunters on the ground follow directions
feral pigs cause *billions* of *dollars* worth of damage to crop fields ever year
