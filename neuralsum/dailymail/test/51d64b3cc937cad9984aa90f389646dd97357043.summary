a 78 - year - old @entity1 man with a long criminal history was arrested on friday , but the man 's lawyer claimed the arrest was a ruse intended to pressure him to talk about the biggest art heist in @entity9 history			1
@entity10 appeared in federal court in @entity12 , @entity1 , on friday and was charged with selling a firearm to an undercover agent			1
his attorney , @entity15 , contended @entity17 agents really want to see what @entity10 knows about the theft of $ 500million in artwork from @entity22 's @entity21 25 years ago			1
they have have never been caught ' the @entity17 has been questioning him for years because they think he knows the whereabouts of the @entity44 paintings , ' @entity15 said			0
he added : ' but he 's being set up , just like others who are threatened with long periods of incarceration by the @entity17 in the @entity44 case			2
' the gun charge is just an excuse to question and threaten him further			0
' police previously identified three suspects in the theft : @entity55 , @entity56 , and @entity10			2
@entity55 and @entity56 have died			0
@entity10 has denied any knowledge of the heist and the missing work			2
the thieves stole two @entity61 - @entity62 ( left ) , believed to be the only seascape the master painted , and a lady and @entity66 in @entity67			0
@entity69 's @entity68 ( right ) was also stolen and is one of approximately 35 known works by the great @entity73 painter @entity74 , painted by @entity75 , shows a man wearing a top hat at a jaunty angle ; it was one of the last paintings to be stolen from the museum @entity83 's ' landscape with an @entity84 , ' painted in 1638 , was originally attributed to @entity85 , but was later found to be the work of his assistant , @entity83 the @entity17 and @entity88 in @entity1 declined to comment on @entity15 's claim			1
the @entity44 heist took place on the rainy night of march 18 , 1990 , when two men posing as police officers arrived at the museum 's front door			1
the guards on duty let them in and the pair allegedly overpowered them , one of whom spoke earlier this year about his guilt of letting the men in			0
the next morning the guards were found duct - taped to chairs in the basement and 13 artworks including @entity85 's ' @entity62 ' and @entity69 's ' @entity68 ' were missing			0
a @entity108 sketch from 1884 ( left ) and a self - portrait of @entity85 ( right ) were also among the items stolen from the museum the empty frames from @entity85 's ' @entity62 ' and @entity69 's ' @entity68 ' remain on display in the museum as a constant physical reminder of the heist and the missing masterpieces left , a visitor looks at the empty frame from a @entity85 work , and right , the museum pictured in 1990 following the heist , the empty frame of @entity85 's oil painting ' a lady and @entity66 in @entity67 ' lies on the floor and a space on the wall remains bare where his ' @entity62 ' once hung in total the haul including three @entity85 works , five sketches by @entity108 , an @entity75 painting and a painting by @entity100 of only 36 in the world			1
a bronze eagle statue , a @entity137 beaker from 1100 @entity138 and a painting by @entity83 were also taken			0
due to a quirk in the museum founder 's will , the empty frames that once held those paintings remain on the walls , an ever - present reminder of one of @entity22 longest - unsolved crimes			1
aside from two sketches of mustachioed men in police hats - one with glasses and one without - little detail has ever been given as to who the thieves may have been			0
the @entity17 identified three persons of interest in the @entity44 case , all with ties to organized crime : @entity55 , @entity56 , and @entity10			2
in 2012 @entity10 's @entity1 home and shed ( pictured ) was searched by the @entity17 in connection with the case gents used radar , as well as two beagles and a ferret , to dig up parts of @entity10 's front lawn in 2012 ; the @entity17 warrant allowed the use of ground - penetrating radar @entity17 investigators have long said they believed organized crime groups were behind the heist			1
@entity10 in 2012 submitted to a lie detector test that showed a high likelihood that he had lied when he investigators asked if he had any knowledge of the heist , according to court testimony			2
a 2012 @entity17 search of @entity10 's home turned up a list of the stolen art pieces and their estimated value , as well as police uniforms			1
@entity10 has a criminal record dating back to the 1950s			0
most recently he spent two years in prison after being convicted of illegally selling prescription drugs to an informant			0
the gun charge he currently faces could carry a ten - year prison charge if he is convicted due to his status as a felon			0
the @entity17 search of @entity10 's home turned up a list of the stolen art pieces and their estimated value , as well as policeuniforms the @entity17 , pictured here in 2013 , has actively offered a $ 5million reward to anyone who had information that led to the painting 's safe return to the museum			1

@entity10 was charged with selling a firearm to an undercover agent
but his attorney claims the arrest was a ruse to get @entity10 to talk about the 1990 @entity22 art heist at the @entity215
@entity10 's house was searched in 2012 and police found a list of the stolen art pieces and their estimated value , as well as police uniforms
the half - a - billion heist remains unsolved and @entity17 has never come close to finding thieves
@entity31 continues to display empty frames , and is offering $ 5million reward for the return of the works
