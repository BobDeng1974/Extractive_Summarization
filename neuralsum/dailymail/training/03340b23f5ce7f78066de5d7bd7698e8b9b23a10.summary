@entity1 forward @entity0 has provided the clearest indication yet that he is open to quitting the club in january			1
the @entity4 international has hardly featured for the @entity6 this season and has grown increasingly frustrated at his lack of action			1
he looked set for a move away in the summer , but @entity12 's ankle injury scuppered any possibility of him leaving			1
@entity0 has found first team opportunities difficult to come by at @entity1 this season @entity0 was all smiles on monday when awarded the @entity16 by chancellor @entity17 but the forward had admitted he is finding his lack of minutes difficult to take and could leave the @entity20 in january			1
' of course i am not happy with my situation right now , ' admitted the @entity23			0
' i ca n’t be satisfied with that			0
we ’ll see what happens in january			0
the signings of @entity28 and @entity29 had pushed @entity0 further down the pecking order ' it is hard when you ca n’t do what you love			2
i do n’t know why that is , you ’d have to ask my coach ( @entity36 ) in @entity37 ' if you ca n't play then you ca n't say he 's not playing well or he has a crisis if you 're not given the chance			2
' if you only come in for 8 or 10 minutes it is hard to get into the game			0

@entity0 ' not happy ' with a lack of @entity1 opportunities
the @entity4 international had looked set to leave in the summer
@entity12 's injury *curtailed* that but @entity0 could leave in january
@entity36 has *dismissed* talk of @entity0 leaving the club however
likes of @entity57 and @entity58 are *interested* in signing the forward
