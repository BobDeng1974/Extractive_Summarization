a group of male politicians have been caught on camera laughing as their fellow mp secretly sniffs a female colleague 's coat during a vote in the @entity8 parliament			1
to the amusement of the ' sexist and vulgar ' group , @entity9 can be seen smelling his fellow mp 's top after she had taken it off and was sitting several benches in front of him			1
the incident occurred during the first round of voting to appoint the country 's new president last week			2
the coat 's owner , @entity32 mp @entity30 , later said the men were ' dullards , and i do n't spend my time with dullards ' , @entity29 reported			1
both @entity21 and @entity9 are former members of the left - wing @entity39 party and its newspaper wasted no time labelling them as ' sexist and vulgar ' in the wake of the incident			0
meanwhile , @entity8 prime minister @entity44 said today he hoped to avoid a snap general election next year after an improved result for his candidate after the second round of the parliamentary vote			0
coat owner @entity30 ( pictured ) later called the two men ' dullards ' when asked to comment on the incident as expected , @entity8 lawmakers failed to reach a majority in favour of the official candidate , @entity56 , but an improved total from the first round left government lawmakers more optimistic ahead of the decisive final round on december 29			1
@entity56 won 168 votes in the 300 - seat parliament , 12 short of the 180 he will need to be elected next week			0
it was eight more than he scored in the first ballot last week when the coat - sniffing incident occurred			0
if he misses the threshold , snap elections will be held , potentially handing power to the @entity39 party which wants to renegotiate @entity8 's international bailout and roll back the austerity policies of recent years .			2
