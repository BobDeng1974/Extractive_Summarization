by @entity0 @entity1 recently had me down as 45 - years - old			1
clearly someone on the site must have thought i had aged 20 years in the past few weeks due to my nocturnal lifestyle			1
i 've also seen some rather disparaging remarks recently on the @entity8 ( always very amusing ) about my increasingly wrinkled visage			1
a bit harsh but it was fair to say that the old boat race had taken a bit of hit from three to four weeks of non-stop party action , and so i 've taken on board the kind advice , and decided to take some drastic anti-ageing measures			1
i 'm a 21st century metrosexual man , and surely enough social taboos have been broken down nowadays that a man can have regular beauty treatments and not have to keep them a secret			2
so i went to see top @entity38 facialist @entity37 at her spa on @entity40 above @entity42 's hair salon			2
i lay down on the beauty couch in the private treatment room and wondered what 's going to happen next			2
will it hurt ? is it addictive ? will i look unrecognizable afterwards ? @entity37 puts me at ease right away but spotted immediately that late nights and too much sunbathing had damaged my skin			2
but help was at hand and the @entity26 treatment was surprisingly relaxing			1
@entity0 counts himself as a metrosexual man and is n't afraid of a little pampering every now and then 1			1
@entity57 - takes off the dead skin , red light helps repair the @entity60 feels very relaxing like a face massage			1
i feel myself dropping off to sleep			2
oxygen infusion of hydrating serums - too much drinking and not enough sleep have left my skin dry as a bone , and dark circles round my eyes			0
this is epic and smoothes out wrinkles from the skin			1
the @entity75 - it feels cool and soothing and although it did make me look like @entity76			0
the mask contains moisturizing hyralonic acid and there was an amazing massage during this section			0
the mask came off and i looked amazing			0
the girls on the show are n't going to know what 's hit them , i 'm going to look about 10 years younger			1
so that 's , what , 35 now ? @entity0 was looking a little tired before his treatment ( left ) but was thrilled with the results of his @entity26 face mask ( right ) and said that he looked about ten years younger			1
what do you think ? next up was a teeth - whitening session at @entity96 in @entity97			0
i was in dire need of this as red wine and coffee had left my teeth far from pearly white			0
the treatment is a perfectly safe non-peroxide treatment , and an hour later after wearing a strange uv device in my mouth my teeth were left gleaming , and got better still a day later			0
no sensitivity , just really white teeth			0
and now to make sure that i do n't age prematurely in the future i 've been advised by beauty editor @entity111 at high - end cosmetics website @entity113 to include these male grooming products into my daily routine			0
exfoliate once a week with @entity116 in 1 @entity117 and wash every day with @entity118 , then moisturize with @entity119 and @entity120			0
a little under - eye boost with @entity122			0
apparently getting eight hours sleep a night , drinking plenty of water and staying out of the sun will help a lot too , but perhaps that 's going a bit too far in the pursuit of beauty			0
lots of love , @entity0 .			1

@entity0 has received lots of comments about his increasingly aging face
in a bid to combat wrinkles @entity0 went for a @entity26 facial
he was thrilled with the results and says he looks about ten years younger
