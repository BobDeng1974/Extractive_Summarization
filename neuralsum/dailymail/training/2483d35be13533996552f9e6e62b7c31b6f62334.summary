@entity1 's aid funding came under fire again last night after an @entity4 spaceship reached @entity5			1
the country , which is receiving £ 1.1billion from @entity1 over four years , entered an elite club of nations to have put a craft into orbit round the @entity5			1
@entity4 spends vast sums on defence and even has its own overseas aid programme worth £ 328million a year			1
pictured are staff from the @entity19 celebrating the success of the mission but despite rapid economic development , it became the biggest net recipient of @entity1 aid in 2010 when it received £ 421million			2
@entity1 ’s overall aid spending will rise by 30 per cent this year as @entity27 hits his target of 0.7 per cent of economic output			0
spending on areas such as policing , prisons and defence have been slashed in recent years as part of efforts to cut @entity1 ’s £ 90billion annual budget deficit			0
big spenders : a comparison of how much countries have spent on their attempts to reach @entity5			2
both @entity42 and the @entity43 failed their first attempts to @entity5 , while the @entity47 mission to @entity5 , dubbed @entity49 mission failed in 2011 and the @entity51 mission to @entity5 ran out of fuel race to the red planet : the @entity56 spacecraft ( artist 's impression pictured ) successfully entered orbit around @entity5 this morning , making @entity4 the first @entity61 nation to reach the red planet jubilant : @entity4 pm @entity64 is seen on a screen as he addresses scientists alongside a graphic of the @entity68 , after the spacecraft successfully entered into the @entity5 orbit , at the @entity19 's @entity71 in @entity72 on wednesday this graphic reveals the trajectory and plans for @entity4 's @entity56			1
@entity19 successfully ignited the main 440 @entity76 liquid engineand eight small thrusters that fired for 24 minutes and trimmedthe speed of the craft to allow smooth orbit insertion under @entity5 ' shadow on average , it lies 141.6 million miles from the sun. with a diameter of 4,222 miles , it ’s around half the size of the @entity86 and has an average temperature of @entity88 ( -65c )			1
gravity is much less powerful - slightly less than 40 per cent of ours			2
the atmosphere is desperately thin – one per cent of @entity86 ’s pressure – and 95 per cent of it is carbon dioxide			2
it boasts the solar system ’s biggest mountain – @entity98 , a dead volcano			0
it measures 335 miles across and rises to a height of 88,000ft , which is almost three times higher than @entity103 has two cosmic sidekicks – the moons @entity106 and @entity107			0
@entity5 ’s red colouring comes from the iron oxide that coats its surface			1
@entity5 has huge amounts of ice at its polar @entity113 they melted , it would cover the whole planet in water 11 - metres deep , according to @entity117			1
but aid spending is spiralling and this year will reach £ 12.6billion a year – more than the £ 12.1billion spent on policing			0
in 2012 international development secretary @entity120 announced that @entity1 will stop aid to @entity4 after this parliament			2
the spacecraft – @entity56 , which means ‘ @entity5 craft ’ in @entity126 – blasted off from a small @entity4 island on november 4 last year			1
it arrived on schedule yesterday after a 485million - mile journey			0
the £ 45million project will see the satellite search for methane gas in the planet ’s geology and atmosphere			1
@entity4 prime minister @entity64 said : ‘ we have gone beyond the boundaries of human enterprise and innovation			1
we have navigated our craft through a route known to very few			0
’ but critics questioned why @entity4 spends so much on a space programme when so many of its people live in poverty			2
one economist condemned the space mission as a ‘ delusional quest for superpower status ’ at a time when half of @entity4 children are malnourished			2
a poll last year found just one in four people supports @entity1 spending billions of pounds on foreign aid every year – and more than 60 per cent believe the cash is wasted			0
@entity159 , of the @entity160 ’ @entity158 , said : ‘ if @entity4 can afford this pioneering project then it is hard to justify sending a single penny of taxpayers ’ cash in overseas aid when they could be doing more to help themselves			2
’ a spokesman for the @entity170 said : ‘ not a penny of @entity1 taxpayers ’ aid money has gone on @entity4 ’s space programme			0
‘ @entity4 ’s recent progress means that all financial grants from the @entity1 to @entity4 will cease in 2015 , after which we will focus on providing help in the form of private sector expertise and technical assistance that will also ultimately benefit @entity1 businesses and jobs			0
’ @entity185 backbenchers have urged mr @entity27 to abandon his aid target			0
but earlier this month , @entity187 backed a @entity188 which would enshrine the pledge in law			0
@entity117 's @entity192 account tweeted a congratulations message to @entity19 's @entity68 , to which it replied ' keep in touch			1
i 'll be around ' vigilant : @entity4 scientists and engineers from the @entity19 monitor @entity4 's @entity56 as @entity4 makes makes space history on @entity5 , @entity42 is hoping to do the same on the moon by 2030			1
the head of @entity202 , @entity201 , said plans were underway for a manned spacecraft to reach the moon by the end of the next decade			0
the system will deliver cargo and cosmonauts to the moon , and someday also into the deep space , according to @entity201			0
' based on the results of lunar surface exploration by unmanned space probes , we will designate [ the ] most promising places for lunar expeditions and lunar bases , ' @entity201 said			0
keen minds : @entity4 scientists and engineers of @entity19 look at a model of the @entity56 at the tracking centre in @entity72 @entity4 prime minister @entity64 in june endorsed the low - cost of the project , saying it cost even less than the budget ' gravity ' ( pictured )			1
the @entity230 blockbuster cost about $ 100 million to make having a blast : a rocket carrying the @entity4 @entity5 orbiter taking off from the east - coast island of @entity235 , @entity4 , on november 5 , 2013			1

@entity68 cost £ 45 million ( $ *74* million ) , three - *quarters* that of gravity
it took *300* days to travel more than *420* million miles ( *670* million *km* )
@entity4 prime minister @entity64 hailed it ' near *impossible* ' success
the spacecraft , called @entity56 , will now study red planet 's surface
spacecraft will study @entity5 for methane , a *key* *chemical* for life on @entity86
data will help scientists better understand how planets and life evolved
