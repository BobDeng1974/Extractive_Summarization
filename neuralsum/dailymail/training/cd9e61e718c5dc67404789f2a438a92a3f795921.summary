by @entity0 college students who interned at @entity2 in the mid-nineties are the latest contenders to come forward as the ' true ' inventors of @entity7 taco			1
@entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10 were part of a summer internship at @entity2 in 1995 when they struck on the genius move of making a taco shell from @entity7 ' chips			1
the group pitched the idea to @entity2 executives as part of a competition for a line of @entity2 - themed appetizers - and lost			1
fast forward 15 years and the interns ' idea ' has become @entity2 's golden ticket			2
the @entity45 taco - which has a spicy , cool ranch or nacho cheese shell - has made $ 1billion for parent company of the two products , @entity51 , since the snack launched in 2012			2
the former interns are not looking for any money for the idea - just some recognition that they were behind the wildly popular snack			1
mrs @entity8 , a former @entity58 student in @entity59 , still has the interns ' marketing materials for the @entity7 tacos as proof			1
she told the @entity64 : ' i ’m sure i signed away that anything i pitched to them was their property anyway			0

mr @entity10 works as a tv writer in @entity76 , mr @entity9 is an advertising copywriter and mrs @entity78 is in corporate sales training			2
in a statement today , @entity2 told @entity81 : ' from interns to inmates , we ’ve had no shortage of people claiming to have thought of the '' idea '' of a @entity7 flavored taco ... the reality is far more boring - the @entity35 that our fans love were conceived , developed , and successfully brought to market by a hard - working , collaborative team at @entity93 and @entity2			1
' @entity9 ( pictured left ) and @entity10 , the former @entity2 interns , told @entity37 this week that their 1995 idea of a cross-promotion with @entity7 did n't win over executives the former interns are not the first to claim they came up with the @entity7 taco			1
last year , friends of @entity102 , who passed away from cancer at @entity104 , petitioned @entity2 after they claimed he came up with the idea but never made a cent			0
mr @entity102 reportedly had the brainwave for the @entity108 while watching tv in 2009 and lobbied the company and @entity2 for two years with a @entity112 campaign until it became a reality			0
@entity2 told @entity81 last year that their ' hearts are with his family ' but added that mr @entity102 ' did not invent ' the snack			0
