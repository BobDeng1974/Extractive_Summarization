it 's the bane of every hiker 's life : what to do when you run out of water			2
is it safe to drink from the nearby stream ? would you risk sipping from that pond over there ? is your level of thirst greater than your willingness to spend the next four days doubled over in the bathroom ? why did n't i just pack my @entity15 water filter ? but now there 's an answer : a straw - shaped portable water filter that enables you to drink safely from any body of water - even from a puddle			1
or , in fact , from a toilet			0
that year it was named @entity47 by @entity48 and @entity49 by @entity50 , and in 2006 it was heralded by the @entity51 as ' a water purifier that could save lives '			2
@entity54 called it ' one of the ten things that will change the way we live '			0
the straw 's powerful purification pipe removes 99.9999 per cent of water - borne bacteria plus many other parasites , including @entity64 , campylobacter , vibrio cholerae , pseudomonas aeruginosa , shigella and salmonella			1
and it will safely filter at least 1000 litres of water			1
( there are only about 13 in your toilet cistern , so plenty to go around			0
) the portable @entity29 kills 99.99 per cent of bacteria and filters at least 1000 litres of water in its lifetime families in a developing parts of rural @entity83 use the @entity29 to filter water and make it safe to drink safe drinking water by numbers ' an estimated 884 million people in the world , 37 per cent of whom live in @entity83 , still use unimproved sources of drinking water			1
' lack of access to safe drinking water contributes to the staggering burden of diarrhoeal diseases worldwide , particularly affecting the young , the immunocompromised and the poor			0
nearly one in five child deaths - about 1.5 million each year - is due to diarrhoea			0
diarrhoea kills more young children than @entity102 , malaria and measles combined			0
' in many rural and urban areas of the developing world , household water - quality interventions can reduce diarrhoea morbidity by more than 40 per cent			1
treating water in the home offers theopportunity for significant health gains at potentially dramatic cost savings over conventional improvement in water supplies , such as piped water connections to households			0
' water filters have been shown to be the most effective interventions amongst all point - of - use watertreatment methods for reducing diarrhoeal diseases			1
' the @entity124 review demonstrates that it is not enough to treat water at the point - of - source ; it must also be made safe at the point - of - consumption			2
@entity29 and @entity129 are both point - of - use water interventions – truly unique offerings from @entity132 that address the concern for affordably obtaining safe drinking water at home and outside			1
' these complementary safe water tools have the potential to accelerate progress towards the @entity140 target of providing access to safe drinking water , which would yield health and economic benefits ; thus contributing to the achievement of other mdgs like poverty reduction , childhood survival , school attendance , gender equality and environment sustainability			0
