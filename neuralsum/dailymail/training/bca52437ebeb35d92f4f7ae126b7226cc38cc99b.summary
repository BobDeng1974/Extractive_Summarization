by @entity0 published : 07:41 est , 13 january 2014 updated : 10:27 est , 13 january 2014 dozens of videos of teenagers and young people fighting have been posted on a disturbing @entity7 page which appears to glorify bare - knuckle bouts			1
the site boasts that its clips are meant to ' entertain ' web users , while some of those featured in the videos say they treat their vicious fights as a type of ' sport '			1
but residents of the areas where the videos were filmed have denounced the ' worrying trend ' of public fights which they say are making their streets more dangerous			1
a leading mp described the @entity7 page as ' very depressing ' , while the father of a young man killed by a single punch urged the fighters to think again about their actions			1
warning : graphic content brawl : this is one of the fights featured on the @entity36 ' , which has been taken down after complaints from campaigners collection : dozens of clips of filmed brawls were featured on the site before it was deleted from @entity7 the ' @entity46 ' page appeared on @entity7 on january 2 , and hosted video clips of 43 different fights , ranging from brawls caught on @entity50 to incidents of violence filmed on bystanders ' mobile phones			1
it was taken down earlier today after receiving negative coverage from campaigners and politicians			1
before the page was deleted , it claimed : ' @entity46 is a @entity7 page which regularly uploads fights that have been recorded by anyone			1
' people can send fights in for us to upload for your entertainment ! please note that we do not encourage the act of fighting without professional or qualified supervision			1
' two of the most popular videos uploaded to the site were filmed in @entity75 , @entity76 , leading residents to speak out against the voyeuristic clips			1
squaring off : a video of two 20 - something men fighting in the streets of @entity75 , @entity76 attracted hundreds of views one video filmed in november last year showed two 16 - year - olds fight , surrounded by 50 other teenagers watching			2
the brawl was sparked by a @entity7 argument , according to one of those involved who admitted that he regularly organises fights because ' it 's like sport '			2
another video from @entity75 featured two men in their 20s punching each other in the face , until one falls to the ground and gets kicked in the head			2
@entity101 , who lives in the area where the violent clip was filmed , said : ' there is a small group of young men around here that treat bare knuckle fighting as a hobby or a sport			0
' it 's a worrying trend round here that more young lads are getting into			0
i suppose they do n't have much else - they have no work , no money			0
' another local resident added : ' the video does n't surprise me at all			0
i 've only lived here for a year and i 'd say that half of those weekends i have seen a fight in some form or another on the streets			0
' the police presence is pretty poor and not much seems to get done about it			0
' attack : the video , filmed on a bystander 's mobile phone , showed the men lashing out at one another merciless : one man is pictured kicking the other as he lies on the ground after being knocked over police have investigated the videos , but have not made any arrests			2
@entity75 mp @entity144 , the former home secretary and foreign secretary , said that the film clips were ' very sad '			0
he said : ' i just think that this is very depressing and i wonder if the individuals involved realise just how sad they are			0
' it 's very difficult to control what goes on the internet but this is terrible for residents that see people fighting on their street in broad daylight			2
' @entity159 , whose son @entity160 was killed in @entity75 in 2010 after receiving a single punch to the head , also spoke out against the violence			1
' it is such an unhealthy development and you have to wonder if these people have really thought about the consequences , ' he said			0
' the key lesson from @entity160 's death was that one punch can kill			0
' i do n't know what can be done about it but i wish that i could tell each of them @entity160 's story and the potential danger they are getting themselves into			0
