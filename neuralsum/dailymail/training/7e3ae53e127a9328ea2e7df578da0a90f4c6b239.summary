a mother has spoken of her devastation after the @entity2 withdrew funding for an operation which could help her daughter walk for the first time			1
@entity6 , 10 , from @entity7 , @entity8 , was diagnosed with cerebral palsy when she was just eight weeks old and has never been able to walk unaided			1
she was due to undergo a potentially life - changing procedure called @entity11 at the @entity12 in @entity13			0
@entity6 ( pictured with her mother , @entity14 ) , 10 , has cerebral palsy and needs surgery to allow her to walk			1
she was offered the operation on the @entity2 but the offer was withdrawn because of budget cuts the idea of the operation is to loosen the muscles to help patients walk independently			1
but the @entity2 has now withdrawn its offer of funding the operation due to budget cuts			1
the hospital announced it would only fund the operation for those children who had completed all the preliminary tests and had a date set for the operation			2
@entity6 had just one more test to undergo but in a cruel twist of fate , she was unable to attend because her mother , @entity34 , was rushed to hospital to have her gall bladder removed			1
had she made the appointment she would have had a date set for surgery and the @entity2 would not have withdrawn their offer of funding			1
ms rider , 33 , said she was devastated by the @entity2 decision			1
she said : ‘ i do blame myself in a way but i ’m angry that @entity6 is not being offered the surgery any more			1
@entity6 's mother is appealing the @entity2 decision but if this fails , she will have to try and raise the money herself ‘ it seems unfair because she missed her second test through a legitimate reason and we ’re being penalised			1
we were so close and because i fell ill and was unable to attend the final appointment , @entity6 ’s chance to walk has been cruelly snatched away			2
’ @entity11 is a neurosurgical technique used to treat spasticity ( increased muscle tone ) in the lower limbs			0
the lower vertebrae are opened to reveal the spinal cord which contains the neurones of the central nervous system			0
these neurones ( bundles of nerve fibres ) channel messages between the brain and different areas of the body			0
electrical stimulation is used to identify and sub-divide sensory and motor nerves			0
this process continues until the specific nerves and nerve roots affecting the spastic muscles are identified and cut			0
due to the size of the nerves and rootlets , this is a very precise procedure and therefore the surgery can last several hours and requires a general anaesthetic			2
many months of physiotherapy are needed after the surgery to retrain the legs			2
ms @entity34 said she could n’t understand how the @entity2 could fund gastric band and breast enlargement operations but were refusing to fund a procedure which could give children the opportunity to walk			1
she is challenging the @entity2 decision but if she is unsuccessful , she will try to raise the money to fund the procedure herself which could cost up to £ 30,000			1
she said : ‘ the @entity2 has said there ’s not enough proof the operation works , but if there ’s even a small chance it could help her walk we want to take it			2
‘ @entity6 ’s school friend had the operation and is now learning to walk , so we ’re hoping someone within the @entity2 will change their mind			1
‘ we ’re in a horrible position at the moment and i ’m trying to make as many people aware of what has happened			0
’ the operation is a neurosurgical technique used to treat spasticity ( increased muscle tone ) in the lower limbs			2
it involves opening the lower vertebrae to reveal the spinal cord which contains the neurones of the central nervous system			0
these neurones ( bundles of nerve fibres ) channel messages between the brain and different areas of the body			0
during the procedure , electrical stimulation is used to identify and sub-divide sensory and motor nerves			0
this process continues until the specific nerves and nerve roots affecting the spastic muscles are identified and cut			0
ms @entity34 said she could n't understand how the @entity2 could fund gastric band and breast enlargement operations but were refusing to fund a procedure which could give children the opportunity to walk ms @entity34 has set up a @entity145 group and launched a petition calling for the @entity2 to fund the potentially life - changing operation			1
to sign the petition click here			0
@entity150 , clinical director for the musculoskeletal and neurosciences directorate at @entity153 , said : ‘ we have been in contact with parents of children referred to @entity153 but where @entity11 surgery had not been agreed to inform them we will not be proceeding with any further pre-operative tests in light of the changes to funding arrangements for this treatment			2
‘ it would be unfair on these children and their families for us to continue a process which may not result in surgery			0
' we ’ve begun discussing treatment and funding options with each individual family			0

@entity6 has cerebral palsy and is unable to walk unaided
she was offered surgery on the @entity2 which could have helped her walk
the offer was then withdrawn because of budget cuts within the @entity2
her mother , @entity34 , says the offer would not have been withdrawn if @entity6 had not missed one of her *pre-surgery* hospital appointments
she only missed it because her mother was rushed to hospital for surgery
ms @entity34 is now appealing the decision but if this fails she will have to raise £ 30,000 to pay for the operation herself
