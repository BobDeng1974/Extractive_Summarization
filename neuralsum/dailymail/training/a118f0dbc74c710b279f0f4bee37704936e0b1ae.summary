by @entity0 published : 13:06 est , 12 october 2013 updated : 13:18 est , 12 october 2013 intelligence : the machine , cutting - edge at the time , used a series of rotor blades to scramble @entity7 messages so they were impossible to read			1
a rare @entity9 encoding machine used by the @entity10 to send secret messages in the dying days of the @entity12 will go on sale this month			1
the machine , built in 1944 , was part of the @entity9 intelligence operation famously thwarted by @entity18 intelligence officers working out of @entity19			1
a specialist from @entity22 auctioneers @entity21 said the ' untouched and unrestored ' device is especially valuable because it still has many of its original parts , and was not modified after the war			1
@entity27 machines were used through the war by the @entity9 military , but this was a later model which sent out even more heavily - encrypted signals than earlier versions , and had billions of possible combinations			1
the device would had three sets of rotors , which scrambled messages typed into the keypad , which were then printed and sent out via @entity7			1
other enigma machines with the rotors configured in the same pattern would be able to read the messages			1
this version also comes with an original ebonite ' plugboard ' , which when added to the @entity27 would swap pairs of letters so that , for example , pressing the f key would send a letter b to be scrambled at the rotors , and would require a matching device at the other end to make sense of the message			2
the machine up for auction at @entity21 was built in 1944 , by @entity57 , @entity58 no. 19088			1
the @entity59 comes complete with its original i , @entity61 and v rotors with @entity64 thumbwheels and matching serial numbers , its makers plate stamped a 19088/jla/44 , and its standard qwertz keyboard with keys made up of white lettering on black background			0
its battery switch , vacant battery box , complete set of bulbs , ebonite plug board , set of three plug board cables , and set of instructions applied to the lid interior together with a spare bulb rack are also original			0
the machine rests in an oak carrying case with a hinged lid and a fall front with a locking mechanism ; when closed , the case measures 6 inches by 11inches by 13 inches			2
' @entity19 ' : @entity19 , pictured , was the hub of the @entity18 intelligence effort , where the @entity27 code was repeatedly broken @entity93 : intelligence analysts , including these members of the @entity96 , worked tirelessly to break @entity9 codes in the @entity12 endless battle : the @entity9 renewed the encryption on the @entity59 machines every day , which the @entity18 would have to crack again @entity101 , a specialist at @entity21 , said : ' it ’s difficult to tell exactly how many @entity59 machines were made			1
' during the war , many were destroyed for fear of them falling into enemy hands , and documents about their manufacture were often burned or simply lost			2
what we do know is that there were at least five mainstream versions employed by the @entity9 military			0
' the first machines to be used in a military capacity only had a fixed set of three wheels			2
later , a set of five wheels were used so that they could be interchanged to dramatically increase the number of variants available			0
' each machine could use the interchangeable wheels from any enigma , so to find a matching set of wheels with the same serial number as the @entity59 is rare			2
' genius : @entity131 , left , was able to beat the enigma machine , right , thanks to a machine he built invention : @entity131 's bombe machine thwarted the @entity27 code			1
they were all destroyed after the war , but one was rebuilt in 2008 , and is seen here with veterans @entity141 , left , and @entity143 , right , who served at @entity19			0
' enigma machines rarely come up at auction , and this particular example is especially unique			0
' it ’s unusual because it has bakelite thumb wheels instead of the more widely used metal ones : this was due to the diminishing availability of metal and other resources for the @entity155 [ @entity9 military ] towards the end of the war			0
' it ’s also special because it ’s untouched and un-restored			0
many machines were picked up by the allies as souvenirs during the final stages of @entity12 , and as such , their parts were mixed and matched			0
' all of the elements of this one bear the same serial number , making it complete and original throughout '			0
unbreakable ? @entity9 intelligence officers thought that @entity27 - encoded messages were uncrackable			2
( photo posed by models ) however , despite the sophisticated features of the encoding machines , @entity9 efforts at keeping their communications secret were continually defeated by teams working at the top - secret @entity19 intelligence centre in @entity179			2
they were able to crack the @entity27 code in part thanks to the efforts of mathematical genius @entity131 , who developed a mechanical device called the @entity186 , a forerunner of modern computers , which was able to greatly speed up the process of cracking @entity9 codes , which changed every day			1
the intelligence gleaned from sources including @entity27 transmissions was known as ' @entity194 ' , and was decisive in the @entity196 victory			0
after winning the war , @entity197 reportedly told @entity199 : ' it was thanks to @entity194 that we won the war			0
' sir @entity204 , the official historian of @entity205 in @entity12 , also held @entity194 in high esteem and said that thanks to the information the war was shortened : ' by not less than two years and probably by four years			0
' the intelligence war waging in a quiet corner of @entity179 was to be decisive in the @entity196 effort to win the @entity12			0
@entity19 - known now as @entity19 - was the hub of @entity18 's code - backing effort , where hugely talented mathematicians and inventors worked tirelessly to give the armed forces a crucial helping - hand			1
as @entity197 himself made clear , the accurate information which flowed from @entity19 every day , at a rate which sometimes reached 6,000 messages a day , saved lives and gave @entity18 a crucial edge in battle			1
@entity131 , the @entity225 - educated mathematical genius , and @entity227 engineer @entity226 , are the two most celebrated figures whose innovations greatly improved the @entity196 ability to decipher @entity9 messages			1
the enigma machine , which was on sale commercially in the 1920s , was modified by the @entity9 to make it more secure			0
they trusted completely that its codes were unbreakable , and used it for all manner of important communications			2
technology : the @entity244 computer , shown here being rebuilt by @entity245 , cracked the @entity9 @entity246 , unlocking even more secret intelligence			0
however , it was thwarted in part thanks to @entity131 's ' @entity250 , which was able to speed up the code - breaking process immeasurably			1
@entity131 based his invention on a @entity254 device , the ' @entity255 ' , which was handed over to @entity18 just weeks before @entity254 was invaded in 1939			1
it was not able to decipher @entity9 codes automatically , but once analysts had manually deciphered a few letters by picking out common words , such as the names of @entity9 generals or short words such as ' to ' and ' they ' , the device could rapidly test hundreds of other possibilities to put together a code			1
over 100 of the machines were built to aid the code - breaking effort , but they were all destroyed when the war ended			1
a replica was built in 2008 , and can be seen at @entity19 , which is now a museum			0
the quest to beat the @entity9 intelligence services also resulted in the construction of the world 's first proper computer - called @entity244			0
developed by @entity226 from a network of thousands of electronic valves , the device was able to crack the @entity246 , which the @entity282 high command used for messages deemed too sensitive for @entity27 transmission			2
the @entity244 , which was five times faster than the original , was finished less than a week before the @entity286 , and gave the @entity196 another crucial edge in the last phase of the war .			0

the device is an advanced model from 1944 , and is completely *unmodified*
the @entity10 used the machines to encrypt messages throughout the war
but @entity18 analysts were able to break the codes using a machine built by mathematical genius @entity131
@entity22 auctioneers @entity21 expect it to fetch **£** *30,000* - **£** *50,000*
