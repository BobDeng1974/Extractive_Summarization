critic : @entity39 rep @entity37 , the chairman of the @entity40 is demanding answers from the @entity3 @entity43 said in a statement to the @entity13 : ' whether @entity3 is trying to protect administrative bureaucrats from congressional and public scrutiny , or just trying to sweep this breach under the rug , @entity3 must come clean and provide a full accounting of this incident			1
' the news comes about a month after it was revealed that @entity3 agents and other @entity55 law enforcement and @entity56 personnel face an average of 55 daily encounters with ' known or suspected terrorists ' named on government watchlists			1
the first : underwear bomber @entity61 , is pictured in his 2009 mugshot after his failed @entity64 bomb attempt the figure - which equals more than 20,000 contacts per year - underscores the growing sweep of watchlists , which have expanded significantly since the failed @entity69 ' underwear ' bombing attempt - and officials noted that very few of those daily contacts lead to arrests			0
civil liberties groups question the use of watchlists , and they have been ridiculed for ensnaring innocent citizens			0
@entity43 said the disciplined workers are the latest in a series of mishaps within the agency designed to protect air travellers			0

in december , @entity139 rapper @entity138 was flying to a gig in @entity141 with two large bags of marijuana in his bag			0
extra eyes : the @entity3 has come under scrutiny in the age of the internet over several incidents , some of which have been caught on tape and spread via sites like @entity106 but instead of confiscating it , the agent who inspected the bag instead left a note saying , ' c'mon son '			2
that same month , not one but two grandmothers came forward to say that they were mortified when they were ordered to be strip - searched during a security screening			2
a @entity3 agent was fired in october after @entity86 writer and lawyer @entity161 found a note in her luggage ( which contained a vibrator ) that said : ' get your freak on girl '			0
