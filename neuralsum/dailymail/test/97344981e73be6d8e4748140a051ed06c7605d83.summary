@entity1 boss @entity0 is convinced there is more to come from striker @entity3 after seeing him plunder his 30th goal of the season			1
@entity3 became the first @entity1 player since @entity7 to reach the 30 - mark with a late strike in his side 's 3 - 1 @entity11 victory at @entity13 on sunday			1
however , @entity0 is convinced the 21 - year - old @entity15 hitman can improve further as he continues to make his way in the game			1
@entity3 calmly slots @entity1 's third goal in time added on after coming one - on - one with @entity20 @entity3 celebrates putting the result beyond doubt as @entity1 claim a 3 - 1 win over @entity13 he said : ' he has big potential			1
he is young and this is his first full season in the first team			2
we need to push him to try to improve his level because he has the potential to improve			2
' it 's a fantastic achievement and i congratulate him			0
he deserves this moment because he has worked a lot			0
it 's an historic thing			0
' he 's happy in the changing room and all his team - mates are happy , and i think all our supporters and the club are happy at his achievement			2
' if it was @entity3 who put the icing on the cake at @entity44 , it was @entity45 and @entity46 who paved the way for his late contribution as the visitors condemned @entity13 to a sixth successive league defeat			1
@entity45 fired them in front on the half - hour and after @entity53 had levelled 20 seconds after the restart , @entity46 scored with a free - kick which evaded all the yellow shirts in the middle and defeated keeper @entity20			1
@entity3 killed off any hopes of a second fightback when he rounded off a 91st - minute break to leave @entity0 delighted			1
@entity1 striker @entity3 at full stretch as he is chased down by @entity13 captain @entity63 @entity3 celebrates his goal against @entity13 as opposition goalkeeper @entity20 looks on in despair he said : ' we fully deserved the victory and the three points			1
i think our performance was better than @entity13 's and i am very pleased for our players			1
' i am happy to recover this feeling after the last two games - that was n't good and it 's important to feel victory again			2
' it proved a difficult day for opposite number @entity78 , whose side had to contend not only with @entity1 , but a boycott by some of their own fans			2
@entity3 is assessed early in the match after inadvertently being caught in the head by the arm of @entity88 @entity78 insisted that had little impact - the official attendance at the 52,000 - capacity stadium was 47,427 - but admitted the @entity93 , who are currently seven points clear of the drop zone , are engaged in a survival fight			1
he said : ' absolutely , we 're in amongst it , there 's no danger of that , because you have got sides - and i 'll use @entity105 as an example - who are winning games			0
@entity53 is in the right place at the right time to pounce on a loose ball in the midfield and equalise @entity13 players join @entity53 as the hard - working midfielder pounces on a loose ball in the area ' but we have got to find a way of trying to find some points and put some points on the board			1
we have to come up with a solution , i have to come up with a solution			0
' i have to find a method of trying to play now that might not be pretty on the eye , but i need to find a way of getting some results , getting some points			0
people might not like what they see , but i 'm going to have to do it			0
' @entity53 jumps for joy after his fourth goal of the season , all of which have been scored at home fans applaud @entity13 's goals while one holds up a ' @entity141 , not @entity142 ' sign during the game @entity144 was installed as @entity146 's replacement until the end of the season in january , and has found himself in the firing line virtually ever since , although he is refusing to throw in the towel			1
he said : ' it 's probably the most difficult situation i have ever been in			0
but i 'm a fighter and i 'm not going to shirk anything			0
i 'll take the stick and i 'll take the responsibility because that 's the type of person i am			0
' but i 'm not going to give up on it			0
yes , i 'm angry and i 'm annoyed , and i 've got my own thoughts in my head that will stay private			0
but i have just got to get on with it because nobody else is going to do it			0
' a plane hired by the supporters of rivals @entity164 heap misery on @entity13 ' we do n't demand a team that wins , we demand a team that tries , ' reads banner outside @entity44			2

@entity0 believes @entity3 still has so much more to give
@entity3 scored against @entity13 to take his season tally to the 30 - mark
he becomes first @entity1 player since @entity7 to reach that tally
@entity0 is convinced 21 - year - old @entity15 hitman can improve further
