for years scientists have worked to find a way to make it easier for deaf and hearing impaired people to communicate			2
and now it is hoped that a new intelligent system could be about to transform their lives			0
researchers have used image recognition to translate sign language into ‘ readable language ’ and while it is early days , the tool could one day be used on smartphones			1
researchers have used image recognition to translate sign language ( pictured ) into ' readable language ' and while it is early days , the tool could one day be used on smartphones scientists from @entity19 and @entity20 came up with the @entity21 ( @entity22 ) , which can capture , interpret and translate sign language			1
it has been tested on gestures and signs representing both isolated words and continuous sentences in @entity19 sign language , with what they claim is a high degree of recognition accuracy and speed			1
its creators say that it has the potential for use in multiple languages			0
the tool uses image processing and pattern recognition to translate actions into words			1
life could get a little easier for visually impaired people too as scientists from @entity47 have created vibrating gloves ( pictured ) which have help people learn to read @entity51 more easily vibrating gloves have been designed that help people learn to read @entity51 more easily			2
scientists at @entity47 placed vibrating motors at the knuckle of each finger in the gloves			0
when one of the motors vibrates , the wearer presses a corresponding key and the system tells them which letter they are typing			0
the gloves were tested on people who had never learned @entity51 before			1
they were then distracted for 30 minutes by playing a game and half of the participants ' gloves kept buzzing so they kept learning passively			0
people wearing the gloves that kept buzzing made 30 per cent less errors than those who did not benefit from the passive haptic training			2
they could read 70 per cent of a @entity51 phrase when tested , compared to those whose training stopped during the game , who could only read 22 per cent			0
‘ at the heart of the @entity22 are real - time image processing and computational intelligence methods , ’ said researcher professor @entity80 , of @entity19 ’s @entity81			1
‘ we developed a novel approach , leading to efficient detection and tracking of face , hands and upper body trajectories of a signer			0
‘ by combining it with our tools for artificial intelligence - based matching between these sign trajectories and elements of a large database of images and video recordings of native signers , we have achieved a fast and flexible automatic sign language translation system			1
‘ the system ’s potential lies in its technologically advanced algorithms and structure , which can be adapted to a multitude of the world ’s sign languages			2
’ everyday communication is a major challenge to a great many hearing - impaired people , as well as those unable to speak , all around the world			2
until now , systems devised to remove these barriers to communication have had limited capabilities in terms of target languages or ease of use			0
according to the study in the @entity124 ’s ( @entity124 ) @entity125 , the early stage technology could be economical enough for mass production and for use on mobile devices			0
the scientists believe that their creation will result in a portable , efficient and affordable @entity22 for a wide variety of sign and written languages .			1

researchers from @entity19 and @entity20 have used image recognition to translate sign language into ‘ readable language ’
their automatic @entity21 ( @entity22 ) can capture , interpret and translate sign language
it **'s** been tested on gestures and signs for words and sentences in @entity19 sign language with a high degree of recognition accuracy and speed
tool could one day be used on people **'s** smartphones
