communications minister @entity0 has refused to throw his support behind prime minister @entity2 over the sacking of chief whip @entity4 on friday			1
appearing on @entity5 on the @entity6 on monday evening @entity0 dubbed the move to get rid of the ' father of the house ' a ' captains call ' when asked by an audience member about the dumping of the iconic @entity14 member			2
in response to the same questioner journalist and @entity16 host @entity15 ripped into the prime minister , slamming him for his ' laundry list ' of personal goals distracting him from leading the country			1
' @entity4 is the father of the house , which means he 's been in parliament for over 40 years , he 's the longest serving member of the house of representatives , ' @entity0 said			0
' he is well - loved , he is well - respected , he is esteemed by all of the @entity14 right across the country ' @entity2 , as @entity4 said , it entitled to appoint and replace the chief whip as and when he wishes that 's his call , ' he added			2
but despite refusing to openly condemn the move by the prime minister , @entity0 seemed to smile as he called the move a ' captain 's call '			1
@entity0 said @entity2 's decision to dump ' father of the house ' @entity4 was a ' captain 's call ' but refused to give his personal opinion on the matter he said he would leave it up to public opinion to determine whether it was the right or wrong decision ' he 's the boss , he 's the captain he can make a captains call , ' he said , which was met with a smirk from fellow panelist @entity15 and laughter from the audience			1
' whether the decisions are right or wrong , time and public opinion no doubt and other events will determine			0
' all i 'm prepared to say about @entity4 is what a fine man he is and i was very sad to see his services terminated in that role			0
full stop , ' @entity0 declared			0
just moments before the communications minister 's response , @entity15 slammed mr @entity78 for his ' broken promises ' and ' laundry list ' of self - motivated goals			1
' i think that problem that @entity2 has now is that there are so many own goals , i mean there 's almost a laundry list now , ' @entity82 began			1
@entity82 admitted that though @entity2 was good in opposition , but also pointed out his shortcomings and hypocrisies as leader of the nation ' it 's just been one thing after the other and then we 've had silly mistakes , silly decisions like the knighting of @entity101 ' she said she gave credit to the prime minister for his ' very effective ' operation as opposition leader , but the @entity16 host also pointed out his shortcomings and hypocrisies as leader of the nation			1
' one of the strongest messages he would come back with during our interviews was that @entity114 broke a promise we will not break promises , ' @entity82 said			0
' ( but now ) we 've got broken promises : we 've got no cuts to the pension , no cuts to the @entity6 or @entity122 , no cuts to education , the submarine contracts look like they 've been broken ' , she continued , pointing out where the @entity14 had failed in her opinion			2
' it 's just been one thing after the other and then we 've had silly mistakes , silly decisions like the knighting of prince @entity101			0
' in terms of these own goals the prime minister even ... he said that the question was not whether or not the @entity138 people thought that prince @entity101 getting that award was appropriate it 's whether the award was appropriate , ' she continued			2
throughout the @entity16 host 's response , @entity0 did not jump to the defence of the prime minister which left many speculating on social media @entity0 , here with @entity26 last week , admitted during the program he was not consulted on the shafting of @entity4 , and he did not know who was spoken to about it before it happened calling the knighthoods awards that @entity2 ' bought back from the dark ages ' and also took aim at the way he was out of touch with the members of his own party			1
' @entity2 only has to look in the mirror to see why he 's having so many problems , and on the issue of @entity4 i would have thought its 's the prime minister 's job to be in touch with his back bench , ' she said			0
' he could n't have been reading a newspaper and he certainly could n't have been talking to anyone in the backbench because we all knew ... everyone watching knew that he had real issues with the backbench ' and 40 per cent of people who sit behind him do n't want him there as leader , ' @entity82 concluded her scolding			0
throughout the @entity16 host 's response , @entity0 did not jump to the defence of the prime minister which left many speculating on social media about his motives			0
a number of commenters pointed out his body language during the exchange , while others drew attention to his slight smirk as @entity82 laid into @entity2 .			2
