by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 threw today the latest negotiating blow in the skirmishing before saturday ’s @entity6 mega-fight with @entity7 by objecting to a second referee			1
but this time his appeal has failed			0
@entity2 lodged a protest against the appointment of @entity12 , who was the replacement for another @entity14			1
it was always doubtful whether @entity2 could succeed in ousting @entity31			1
the @entity32 require all referees , be they domestic or foreign , to undergo stringent medical tests before officiating in this country			0
with @entity2 having insisted on the entire panel of the referee and three judges coming from overseas , it was always likely to be too late for a new man to fly here in time to be cleared			1
@entity2 , concerned that @entity31 ’s preference for a free - flowing fight might benefit @entity7 , still thought it worth a try – but the @entity46 have declared that their referee will be the third man standing			1
@entity26 says now : ‘ no more drama with the officials			2
@entity31 is the referee and the judges are in place			2
but in a big fight like this all possible advantages get exploited			0
no doubt there will be more mind games			0
’ the complaints saga began with @entity2 successfully demanding that the @entity46 mandate this world super-middleweight title re-match after he was controversially stopped in the first fight			1
then came his protest against home officials			0
gloves on : @entity7 's ( right ) rematch with @entity2 ( left ) will take place on saturday at @entity6 after the exclusion of @entity27 , @entity69 ’s @entity68 vetoed one of the judges on the grounds that he is @entity74 , home - land of @entity7 ’s parents			1
then he wanted @entity31 removed			0
even though that has not happened , @entity2 will not refuse to fight			2
were he to do so the promotional losses , given the logistical problems of getting @entity6 ready for boxing less than 24 hours after @entity82 ’s @entity81 footballers play @entity83 there could well result in costly legal actions			0
rejected : @entity7 's promoter @entity26 has already turned down @entity27 as a possible official for the fight @entity26 made it clear that neither he nor @entity7 would have opposed any new referee if one could have been installed in time			1
he said : ‘ @entity7 could n’t care less who is the third man in the ring			0
@entity92 can referee the fight if he wants			0
’ one apparent advantage for @entity7 has been secured by the staging of friday ’s weigh - in at 4 pm , giving the naturally heavier @entity97 less time to regain weight than if it had gone ahead at lunchtime .			2

@entity2 has failed in his protest about referee @entity12
@entity31 will referee @entity2 ' @entity106 and @entity46 super-middleweight bout against @entity7
@entity7 fights mandate groves in a rematch at @entity6 on may 31

@entity2 is concerned that @entity31 's preference for a free - flowing fight might benefit @entity7
