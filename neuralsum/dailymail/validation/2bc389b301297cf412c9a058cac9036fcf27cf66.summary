@entity0 has paid @entity1 a huge compliment by likening his recent performances to those of @entity5 and @entity6			1
five years after signing for @entity7 , @entity1 is yet to convince many @entity7 fans he and @entity9 are suitable long - term replacements for @entity11 and @entity12 , who left @entity13 last summer after long and distinguished careers			1
the 25 - year - old has been the object of a few taunts , most recently in the @entity19 derby last november when he was sent off in the 39th minute			0
@entity7 defender @entity1 ( centre ) has impressed @entity0 in recent weeks @entity0 believes @entity1 's passing has been ' crisper ' during his displays against @entity23 and @entity24 @entity1 , already on a booking , showed a complete lack of composure by hacking down @entity28 in the corner to earn his second yellow and @entity7 went on to lose 1 - 0 against a @entity32 team that was there for the taking			1
@entity1 has since shown signs of improvement , though			2
his commanding performance in last week 's 3 - 0 victory over @entity39 caught @entity0 's eye and the former @entity7 captain thinks that bodes well for @entity43 ahead of sunday 's trip to @entity45			1
@entity0 said : ' @entity1 is a good defender			1
i have seen him improve over the last few games			0
' i even thought against @entity23 and @entity24 away , his passing was a lot better , a lot crisper , so he has come on to a good game , he is in good form at the moment and that will be important at @entity54			0
' @entity1 kept 26 - goal striker @entity55 quiet last sunday and the former @entity57 man ventured forward , striding confidently with the ball at his feet on a few occasions			2
the end product was not good enough to suggest @entity62 has a new @entity63 in his squad just yet , but @entity0 was so impressed by @entity1 's confidence that he felt moved to liken the centre - back to two @entity7 greats in @entity6 and @entity5			1
@entity1 kept a close eye on @entity39 striker @entity55 during @entity7 's win against @entity39 the former lifted 10 trophies at @entity7 and the latter would have won much more than the 1985 @entity73 had he not fought a long - running battle with alcoholism which eventually cost him his place at the club			1
' @entity5 could do that and so could @entity6 , ' @entity0 said when invited to liken @entity1 's display to a figure from the past			1
' when you keep possession at the back sometimes it 's really important that your defenders break past the forwards and they get into the midfield area			0
' that means one of your midfield players should be able to get space and i thought @entity1 did that particularly well against @entity39 and that made it difficult for the @entity39 players			2
' @entity1 seemed pleased to be compared to two defensive stalwarts of the sir @entity100 era			2
@entity0 has compared @entity1 to former @entity7 defender @entity5 @entity1 has also been compared with @entity6 ( left , pictured with @entity101 in 1996 ) ' it 's a great feeling know that people are taking notice , ' @entity1 said			1
' i am just hoping i can keep it up and keep a good run and contribute to our results			0
' @entity1 will have to be at his very best again on sunday at @entity45			0
@entity62 has warned the centre - back - and the rest of his team - mates - they must not get sent off in this volatile fixture			0
as well as pride and bragging rights , a place in the top four is at stake			0
@entity54 have not lost since they fell 3 - 0 at @entity13 in december and a victory for the hosts would move them above @entity7 into fourth for the first time since august			2
@entity0 thinks victory against @entity54 would deliver a significant blow to the @entity127 ' top - four hopes and is not ruling out a second - place finish for @entity7 , who trail @entity32 by just two points after their loss at @entity132 last weekend			1
' yes , ( second ) is a realistic target , ' the former @entity7 captain said			0
' we have to play @entity32 and @entity23 at home and if we beat both of them all of a sudden your points tally is looking really good			0
' when you talk about the top teams it seems as if you look at it like you are going to get beat all the time and the lads have proven that they can perform really well against a top team like @entity39			0
' and a win at @entity54 at this stage of the season would be a fantastic result for us			0
' @entity0 and @entity1 were speaking at the launch of bwin @entity152 - the world 's first club - based real money casino app which is available now on @entity156 from @entity157 and will be available soon on @entity158 through the @entity159 .			1

@entity0 has *lavished* *praise* on @entity7 's @entity1
@entity1 has failed to hold down a first - team spot since *joining* @entity7
@entity0 *insists* @entity1 has improved his passing range in recent weeks
