by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 05:42 est , 10 march 2014 updated : 06:20 est , 10 march 2014 battle : @entity4 , 16 , is fighting for his life after taking @entity7 pills at a house party a teenager has been arrested for alleged drugs offences after two boys were taken to hospital having taken ' @entity7 ' ecstasy tablets			1
a 16 - year - old - named locally as @entity14 - remains in a serious but stable condition in intensive care after taking a pill at a house party in @entity19 , near @entity20 , on saturday night			1
a 17 - year - old who came to the hospital with him was discharged following tests			1
it 's believed the teenagers swallowed red ' @entity7 ' ecstasy tablets at the party - the type linked to the death of 17 - year - old @entity30 from @entity31 in @entity32 last month			1
@entity33 said a 16 - year - old boy has been arrested and is expected to appear at @entity35 tomorrow			1
mr @entity37 and his unidentified friend were admitted to @entity39 in @entity40 at about 11.30pm on saturday evening , a police spokesperson added			0
the illegal drugs they had taken included ecstasy and ' possibly ' a @entity7 tablet , the spokesperson went on to say			2

the 17 - year - old died after taking one of the tablets at @entity20 nightspot @entity55 on february 1			1
warnings issued about the red pills following miss @entity30 's death were renewed yesterday			2
dr @entity59 , @entity60 in @entity61 , said : ' we can not stress highly enough that anyone who takes an illicit drug is putting their health , and indeed their life , in jeopardy			0
users can never actually be sure of what they are taking and what the contents are			0
' ' we would urge anyone who has taken an ecstasy tablet , and in particularly @entity7 , who feels unwell to seek urgent medical advice and treatment from their local hospital			0
' warning : 16 - year - old @entity4 is in a serious condition after police believe he took a @entity7 pill tragic : @entity30 died after taking mortal kombat in a @entity20 nightclub , @entity55 , last month ' @entity7 ' tablets are particularly lethal because they contain an active ingredient called @entity87			1
@entity87 is five - times stronger than @entity89 's typical active ingredient - but takes far longer to kick in , meaning young and inexperienced users will often take extra pills while waiting to feel the effects			1
as with all street drugs , @entity7 tablets may also be cut with a whole host of other substances - including dangerous chemicals - so even experienced users can never be 100 per cent sure what they are actually taking			2
@entity87 is sold for as little as £ 3 , and usually comes as red or pink @entity101 sweet - shaped pills that are stamped with an 'm ' or a image of a dragon			2
the drug is also occasionally sold as powder			0
@entity87 often has the same street names as ecstasy as it has a similar effect to @entity110			0

' early warning signs include a feeling of agitation and distress and it is important that people are seen as early as possible if they experience any of these symptoms , ' dr @entity59 went on to say			0
@entity33 's inspector @entity125 added : ' further to previous warnings , i would again strongly advise people to avoid illicit drugs as their exact content is unknown and can contain dangerous chemicals			0
users must be aware of these dangers and understand the devastating effect they can have			0
' currently , the full ingredients of the so - called @entity7 pill remain unknown , but drug experts have warned it may contain another substance called @entity87 , which was blamed for the deaths of more than 10 young people within a 60 - mile radius of @entity141 last year			1
@entity87 is sold in pills costing as little as £ 3 or in a crystal - like form , are sometimes pink and shaped like @entity101 sweets , or stamped with an 'm '			2
the drug often has the same street names as ecstasy as it has a similar effect to ecstasy 's main chemical , @entity110			0
but the active ingredient in @entity87 is five times stronger and takes longer to kick in , meaning many revellers take extra pills			2
@entity87 has been linked to multiple deaths , both in the @entity112 and in @entity113 , @entity114 and @entity115			0
detective inspector @entity156 , of @entity157 , appealed for anyone with information about the supply of illegal mortal kombat drugs to come forward			0
