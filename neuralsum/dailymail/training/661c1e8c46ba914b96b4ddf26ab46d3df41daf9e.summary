by @entity0 @entity1 was accused of presiding over a ‘ shambles ’ as the head of the government ’s child abuse inquiry resigned six days after being appointed			1
@entity6 , 80 , had faced pressure from mps , lawyers and child protection experts over her brother ’s involvement in an alleged cover - up of an establishment paedophile ring			1
the former judge said that , when accepting the inquiry role , she had not ‘ sufficiently considered ’ the difficulties posed by allegations about her brother , the former attorney general sir @entity19 , might cause			1
@entity6 has resigned from the child abuse inquiry less than a week after her appointment @entity1 's judgement was called into question today , after @entity6 resigned from the child abuse inquiry sir @entity19 is accused of trying to silence whistleblower @entity25 before he outed a senior civil servant and suspected @entity28 officer as a paedophile in the @entity30			1
details of the attempted ‘ cover - up ’ was revealed in the @entity33 on july 5 – a week before @entity6 ’s appointment			1
however , under hostile questioning from mps , home secretary mrs may said she had not personally been aware of them until the last few days			0
the admission raised serious questions about the vetting procedure undertaken in @entity43 before such a crucial appointment			0
mps said ministers must now find someone with ‘ the integrity of @entity49 ’ to take over the inquiry			2
‘ i was honoured to be invited by the home secretary to chair the wide - ranging inquiry about child sexual abuse and hoped i could make a useful contribution			1
‘ it has become apparent over the last few days , however , that there is a widespread perception , particularly among victim and survivor groups , that i am not the right person to chair the inquiry			2
‘ it has also become clear to me that i did not sufficiently consider whether my background and the fact my brother had been attorney general would cause difficulties			1
‘ this is a victim - orientated inquiry and those who wish to be heard must have confidence that the members of the panel will pay proper regard to their concerns and give appropriate advice to government			1
‘ nor should attention be allowed to be diverted from the extremely important issues at stake , namely whether enough has been done to protect children from sexual abuse and hold to account those who commit these appalling crimes			2
‘ having listened to the concerns of victim and survivor groups and the criticisms of mps and the media , i have come to the conclusion that i should not chair this inquiry and have so informed the home secretary			0
‘ i should like to add that i have dedicated my life to public service , to the pursuit of justice and to protecting the rights of children and families and i wish the inquiry success in its important work			0
’ yesterday @entity103 insisted that @entity6 ’s replacement must not be an mp , peer , judge or member of the @entity109 – because all these groups have been linked to the cover - up of child sex abuse			1
mr @entity103 , chairman of the @entity113 , warned it would be an almost ‘ impossible task ’ to find someone suitable			0
he told mrs may : ‘ the last couple of weeks have been somewhat shambolic			0
’ he added : ‘ we all acknowledge that being home secretary is not like a walk in the park , but the last few weeks have been quite a surprise for a government department that we thought was extremely well run under your stewardship			0
‘ what has gone wrong ? why is it all unravelling ? ’ the episode marks the latest in a series of headaches for mrs may			0
her special adviser resigned following an extraordinary row with @entity135 , the @entity136 , and she has since been criticised over the ongoing crisis at the @entity138 , as well as the admission that 114 files relating to allegations of child sex abuse were lost by her department			2
officials had hoped the appointment of @entity6 would reassure the public and @entity88 that the issue of an alleged @entity149 paedophile ring was being taken seriously			1
but , within hours of being put in charge , mps and lawyers for victims of sexual abuse began to question whether – as an ex-judge and sister of sir @entity19 – she had a conflict of interest			1
this was followed by what mrs may called ‘ suggestion and innuendo ’ about @entity6 ’s role in past inquiries into paedophilia			2
claims were also made about the late sir @entity19 attending parties in the 1980s at which young boys were abused			2
it is believed that , over the weekend , @entity6 began to question whether she should resign , and then told ministers she intended to quit			2
mrs may told @entity88 : ‘ i reject entirely the suggestion that she was n’t the right person to do this job , but she has taken the decision [ to quit ] herself			0
’ mr @entity103 said that , in standing down , @entity6 had shown better judgment than the government had in giving her the role in the first place			2
he accused ministers of failing to carry out proper ‘ due diligence ’ , telling @entity182 : ‘ poor old @entity6			1
she ’s the victim in all this			0
’ allegations : sir @entity19 , @entity6 's brother , is accused of tryign to silence a whistle blower who was attempting to uncover a senior @entity28 officer as a paedophile in the 1980s @entity192 mp @entity191 , who organised a letter signed by 140 mps calling for the inquiry , said that once it decided to hold one , the @entity196 rushed @entity6 ’s appointment ‘ without doing its homework ’			1
the peer ’s brother , sir @entity19 was accused of the ‘ cover - up of the century ’ by mp @entity25 over his refusal to prosecute @entity205 diplomat sir @entity204 , a member of the infamous @entity206			1
the then attorney general is said to have rowed outside the @entity209 chamber with mr @entity25 as he tried in vain to stop him using parliamentary privilege to name sir @entity204 as a paedophile			1
deputy labour leader @entity214 has conceded that the paedophile ring was ' trying to infiltrate every part of the system ' and ' probably ' succeeded @entity214 yesterday conceded that the notorious @entity206 probably infiltrated the @entity196 in the 1970s			0
@entity206 was an affiliated member of the @entity219 ( @entity219 ) while she was @entity219 ’s legal officer from 1978 to 1982			0
@entity221 ’s deputy leader said in a radio phone - in last night that the group had ‘ probably ’ also found its way into the @entity196			0
she told @entity225 : ‘ i do n’t know categorically but they were trying to infiltrate every part of the system ’			0
miss @entity214 has already said that the child abuse inquiry , called by the government last week , would have to investigate links between @entity206 and the civil liberties group she used to work for – now called @entity219			1
last night she added that @entity6 was right to step down as head of the inquiry , due to her brother having served as attorney general during the period being investigated			1
this is despite @entity238 saying last week that the @entity6 was ‘ exactly the right person to lead the inquiry ’			1
miss @entity214 said that while she is ‘ clearly a good and well respected person ’ , she had failed to gain the confidence of victims			0
‘ obviously they should have thought this through a bit more ’ , she said			0
‘ people feel there have been so many cover - ups and so much not listening to the victims ... if people think there is still going to be a cover - up , there is going to be defensiveness on behalf of the establishment , then this inquiry wo n’t achieve what [ it ] really needs to achieve			2
’ miss @entity214 added last night that child sex abuse was ‘ not a party political issue ’			0
she also reiterated that she had ‘ never had anything to do ’ with @entity206 while at the @entity219 .			0
