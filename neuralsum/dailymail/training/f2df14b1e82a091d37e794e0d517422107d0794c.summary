the former @entity7 host was caught calling one critic a ' c * * * ' and telling another to ' eat a bag of s * * * ' , after they condemned his use of the controversial term ' thinspiration ' in an @entity15 post			1
@entity16 is a term used to describe online posts which encourage eating disorders , and have been banned on sites like @entity21 and @entity22			1
@entity5 seemed unaware of the term 's significance when he included it in the caption of a photo showing his dramatic weight loss earlier last month			1
so when @entity15 users started criticizing him , @entity5 got defensive and shot back with profanity - in one case going so far as to tell one user to commit suicide			1

# victory # eyesontheprize # anythingispossible # fitness # transformation # thinspiration , ' @entity5 wrote			0
when one user called him out for using the negative term , he shot back with a comment reading ' @entity83 ' - which stands for ' do i look like i give a f * * * ? ' when one user tried to explain the significance of ' thinspiration ' , @entity5 shot back with ' @entity83 ? ' - meaning ' do i look like i give a f * * * ? ' @entity5 sent that comment to a friend of @entity88 , a 27 - year - old fat activist who sought to put the foodie in his place			1
online row : fat activist @entity88 , 27 ( pictured ) , was one of the many @entity15 users that tried to explain thinspiration to @entity5			2
he called her a c * * * in a post on her blog @entity97 , @entity88 described how @entity5 first ignored her comment on his page			2
she then wrote a post on her personal @entity15 , asking others to ' tell him that eating disorders are not a joke and nothing to take lightly '			2
that 's when @entity5 got even more angry , calling ms @entity88 a ' c * * * ' in a message that subsequently got deleted off his page			1
but that did n't stop him from using the hateful word again in yet another post on ms @entity88 's personal @entity15			0
when she told him he needed to apologize , @entity5 wrote back saying to ' give me a f * * * * * * break			2
' ' if anyone acts like a c * * * i 'll call them one			0
it 's not misogyny , it 's calling a spade a spade			0
maybe you 're the one being aggressive & unfair - and yes , if my use of the hashtag offended you , it was unintentional & for that i 'm sorry			0
' when two of ms @entity88 's friends wrote to @entity5 , he responded similarly			0
' seriously - grab a razor blade & draw a bath			0
i doubt anyone will miss you , ' @entity5 wrote to @entity15 user @ _ bechen to user @ thefattestfox @entity5 said : ' oh eat a bag of s * * * , dummy			1
' @entity5 did end up apologizing though , when he tweeted a statement saying : ' yes			0
i 've responded to internet hate recently with vile words directed at those hating me			0
i should know better & will do better			0
' proof : @entity88 shared screen shots of her online altercation with @entity5 in a blog post ' grab a razor blade and draw a bath ' : @entity5 went so far as to tell one of ms @entity88 's friends to commit suicide ms @entity88 says she has no problem with @entity5 's weight loss , just his use of a damaging word that has an even greater effect since he is a celebrity with more than 92,000 followers on @entity15			1
' as a public figure , even if you have a personal @entity15 ( @entity5 has 94,000 followers ) you need to understand that the things you say will be scrutinized , and the words you use have meaning , ' ms @entity88 wrote			2
' you need to be extra careful to think about not what you mean when you say things , but how other people will interpret them			0
and in a society where eating disorders are at an all - time high , thinspiration is a loaded word			2
' for now , @entity0 is replaced @entity60 with a show about grilling .			0
