@entity0 and @entity1 kept their hopes of qualifying for the masters very much alive on the opening day of the @entity6 at @entity7			1
both men had the daunting task of knowing only a victory in @entity11 would be enough to book a trip to @entity13 next month for the first major championship of the year			1
but they got off to excellent starts on thursday , with @entity16 's @entity0 carding a 67 and @entity1 a 68 to finish two and three shots respectively behind @entity19 's @entity18			1
@entity20 @entity1 watches on during the opening day of the @entity6 at golf du @entity7 @entity1 , chasing a spot at next month 's masters , shot a round of 68 to stay in contention for the title in @entity11 @entity18 , who was one shot off the lead before the final round of the @entity30 was cancelled due to bad weather on sunday , made the most of his sponsor 's invite to card a flawless 65			1
the 22 - year - old chipped in on the first for an eagle and repeated the trick on the sixth for the first of his five birdies to finish one shot ahead of @entity43 's @entity42 , who carded seven birdies and a solitary bogey on the 18th			1
@entity0 shared third place with @entity48 's @entity47 and @entity43 's @entity49 , with @entity1 a shot further back after five birdies , an eagle and three bogeys in his round			1
starting from the 10th , @entity0 - who won the @entity55 on his home course in @entity57 a fortnight ago - birdied his first two holes and also picked up shots on the 16th and 17th to reach the turn in 32			2
@entity0 carded 67 on thursday to remain near the top of the leaderboard in @entity11 further birdies on the first and seventh took @entity0 to six under , but the 28 - year - old ran up a double bogey on the next after his tee shot rolled back off the green and his first chip caught the same slope and came back to his feet			1
however , the world number 69 made amends with a birdie from 20 feet on the ninth , just minutes after @entity1 had holed from an almost identical position			2
' @entity13 is on my mind , obviously , ' @entity0 said			1
' i 'm here to try to qualify , but i 'm just trying to play golf and hopefully on sunday i will be in contention			2
@entity0 prepares to take a tee shot on the opening day of the @entity6 at golf du @entity7 ' there is still a lot of work to be done			2
if it all does n't work out then i 've got a nice five - week holiday			0
i 'm just playing and enjoying my golf			0
i 'm in a good space mentally			0
' @entity1 led from start to finish here in 2013 and looked to have done enough to climb into the world 's top 50 and secure his @entity96 debut			2
however , after the results of the @entity99 were taken into consideration a few hours later , the 34 - year - old discovered he was ranked 51st and had missed out by just 0.03 world ranking points			0
' it 's a big week for me and four under is a good start , ' @entity1 told @entity104 4			2
' i 'm really excited about playing the masters , i 've never played it			0
i finished it off two years ago and still did not get in			0
it was a little horrible			0
@entity109 must win the title this weekend to qualify to play in the masters at @entity13 ' i 'm going to keep doing what i did today , try hard not to make any stupid mistakes			1
i have got the experience and i know the golf course			0
i will make enough birdies i reckon ...			0
just ( need to ) avoid the mistakes			0
' @entity1 and @entity0 were not the only members of the field with @entity120 on their minds , with @entity122 , @entity123 , @entity124 and @entity125 all having chances to move into the top 50 before monday 's deadline			1
@entity128 was the best placed of that quartet after an opening 70 , with @entity122 recording a 72 and @entity123 two over following a 74 , while @entity125 struggled to a 77 which was matched by defending champion @entity132 .			0

the first major of the year , the masters , begins on *april* 9 in @entity13
@entity0 and @entity1 must win in @entity11 to qualify
@entity0 carded 67 and @entity1 68 to stay in touch with leader @entity18
