a judge has ruled a mother serving life in prison for murder must be allowed to regularly see her children - despite the wishes of their father who wants to leave the country and move to @entity10 with them to start a new life away from her			1
judge @entity15 's order requires @entity16 to take his children from their home in @entity19 to visit @entity20 at the women 's prison in @entity23 , @entity24 even though she is serving a prison sentence for executing her neighbour 11 - years ago while they were in the room next door			1
' do you think @entity20 cared about the children when she stashed them in the room 15 feet from where she fired 11 shots ? ' said @entity35 attorney @entity34 today			1
' she should have lost any and all rights to make those kinds of decisions or to have an influence in her kids ' lives when she executed somebody			0

the mother who is serving life in prison for killing a neighbor in 2001 has been granted continued visitation rights with her two minor children , who were present in the rural @entity24 home during the execution - style slaying in the ruling issued last week , judge @entity15 said @entity16 can not move to his native @entity10 with his 14 - year - old boy and 12 - year - old girl until @entity20 's appeals are exhausted , even though @entity16 claims his temporary visa has already expired			1
@entity35 attorney @entity34 said thursday that it is unbelievable @entity20 maintains parental rights after a jury convicted her of shooting 20 - year - old @entity63 at their home in @entity66 in 2001 while the children – then 3 and 1 – were one room away			1
judge @entity15 said the 14 - year - old boy and 12 - year - old girl have a ' long , positive history with their mother , ' whom she called an excellent parent			1
she said the visits will help ' bring closure to the sudden and traumatic events of the past year ' in which @entity20 was arrested and convicted of killing @entity63 as part of a plot to frame her first husband , @entity80 , who is the father of her child @entity81 , for a home invasion			1
ten - years ago @entity83 was celebrated as a heroic mother who acted in self - defence to protect herself and her children from men who broke into her home in @entity66 , @entity24 and assaulted her			1
@entity63 , her neighbour was found slumped at the bottom of a bed at @entity20 and @entity16 ’ home in december 2001 in a pool of blood			1
one bullet had gone through his head and out of his eye socket			0
@entity98 and @entity99 pictured with their mother @entity20 in this undated photograph ( left ) now live with their father @entity16 ( right ) she claimed that with her husband on a business trip , she was home with her three young children - @entity81 - when @entity63 and another man barged through her unlocked door			1
@entity16 said one of the men choked her with panty hose , she lost her glasses and blacked out and woke to the sound of @entity81 screaming , who was holding a baseball bat to protect his younger siblings			2
she said she ran to the bedroom and reached for the gun safe , as @entity63 tugged at her hair and yanked on her feet			2
when the safe opened , she grabbed a 9mm handgun and pulled the trigger			0
then she said she grabbed a revolver , spotted @entity63 moving and fired at him			2
he stopped moving and the second man fled			0
she later said it was only one man , not two , who got away			0
her attorney picked up on inconsistencies in @entity16 's story as she retold it			2
in different accounts , she said she fired from different positions			0
@entity136 : this photo shows the home of @entity83 in @entity66 , @entity24			0
in 2001 , she fired nine shots from two guns into @entity63 , a 20 - year - old neighbour who died on the floor of her bedroom murder trial : @entity83 , now 46 , left , fired nine shots from two guns into @entity63 , right , in 2001 - a 20 - year - old neighbour who died on the floor of her bedroom in january , 2011 @entity35 had a new prosecutor in @entity34 , who went through years of files and months later filed a first - degree murder charge against @entity16 , who is now called @entity20			1
and in november 2011 a court in @entity24 found that @entity20 shot @entity63 several times at close range in the back of the head in her bedroom , and concocted an elaborate hoax that she acted in self - defense to protect her children after @entity63 and another man attacked her			1
it was established by the court that @entity20 wanted to frame her first husband and father of her first child and paint him as the man who in fact hired @entity63 as a hitman to kill @entity20			1
the court heard this was because he was attempting to take sole custody of his child and was threatening to cut of the $ 1,000 in child support he was paying monthly to @entity20			0
and then a key piece of evidence emerged - a pink spiral notebook that had been recovered from @entity63 's car			2
in @entity63 's handwriting , it suggested he had been hired as a hit - man by a ‘ mysterious fellow ’ named @entity181 , who was @entity20 's first husband			1
they split up four years after marrying in 1988			0
' @entity80 wants me to get / force his ex @entity20 to kill her son @entity184 and then commit suicide , and if that plan fails @entity187 is to make it appear as though @entity20 had committed the murder of her son & then committed suicide , ' he wrote			0
@entity20 was found guilty of an elaborate ruse to frame her first husband who was threatening to cut of alimony payments originally @entity20 was hailed as a hero for protecting her children against a home invasion but after the tireless work of @entity35 attorney @entity34 her guilt was established in the murder of @entity63 but investigators never believed it was credible			1
@entity63 , a special education student , did not like to write and he had never met mr @entity80			0
prosecutors suspect she had convinced @entity204 to write the diary , perhaps on the day he died			0
@entity16 , on a business trip during the shooting , initially stood by his wife 's account			0
but the two eventually divorced and @entity20 took primary custody of their children until her arrest last year			1
@entity16 then moved with the children to a @entity19 city he has not disclosed , saying he fears for their safety			2
and days after her conviction , @entity20 was caught sending letters containing @entity16 ' social security number and other information that could be used to find him to an incarcerated @entity222 sex offender			1
the female judge has ruled that because @entity20 held sole custody of her children for the ten years before her arrest she has a unique relationship with her children that needs to be preserved a crucial piece of evidence that was presented during @entity20 's trial in october was a pink notebook that the prosecution claimed was written by @entity20 and not @entity63 - who suffered from learning difficulties judge @entity15 ruled that @entity20 's contact with the inmate was ' not consistent with the duties imposed on a joint legal custodian			1
' but she said @entity16 did n't present enough evidence to justify hiding in @entity19 , saying : ' it is @entity16 who has created the distance and hardship that is attendant to visiting @entity20 in @entity24			2
' @entity15 ordered @entity16 to disclose their address so @entity20 can send her children mail , including tapes of her reading them books			1
in addition to the visits , @entity20 was granted 30 - minute phone conversations on the kids ' birthdays			2
@entity16 ' attorney , @entity255 , said he was considering appealing the decision , which he called the first of its kind in @entity24			0
@entity255 said he was also exploring settlement options that would allow @entity16 and the children to return to @entity10 , where he has employment opportunities and family support			1
remembered : the grave site for @entity63 in @entity265 , @entity24			0
seen through the middle of the heart is the gravestone of his father , @entity269 , who committed suicide at that spot the year after his son 's death ' we were disappointed in the ruling , primarily because we did n't believe it was in the best interests of the children to be visiting her at the prison , ' @entity255 said			0
' the biggest concern we have , other than the trauma of going to a prison and seeing your mom there , is that mom and her family have continued to blame @entity16 for the predicament she 's in			0
' @entity34 , the prosecutor , said he believed the decision did not consider @entity16 ' rights as a father			2
' it 's just mindboggling how somebody that is convicted of murder , fraud and perjury still gets a say , ' he said			0
' and not only does she get a say , the spouse is ordered to travel 1,500 miles to facilitate visitation with the very person that was convicted of the murder but yet blames him for it			0
can you imagine ? '			0

judge has ruled that @entity16 can not take his children with him to @entity10 as their murderer mother still has legal visitation rights
@entity20 was found guilty in october 2011 of killing her 20 - year - old neighbour @entity63 in 2001

her children aged one and three were in the room next door at the time
