whilst @entity1 may look nothing short of fabulous in her new shoot , she has revealed that in real life she is nothing like her super stylish alter ego @entity7			1
speaking to @entity10 the 49 - year - old actress and shoe designer said : ' i ’m not an expert on women , on sex , on dating , on romance			1
' i ’m not interrogative that way ; it ’s not the way i talk to my friends			2
i have friendships that are intimate and hopefully i have a good ear for them			2
but i do n’t know what general issues are for women			2
in @entity42 had a longstanding column for fictional newspaper the @entity44 in which she would proffer her musings on love , life and @entity48			2
however , whilst @entity1 may not be into doling out advice like @entity7 , one thing they definitely have in common is their love of fancy footwear			1
in fact , @entity1 has her own line of shoes and handbags including a 25 piece collection designed with the help of @entity61 , ceo of @entity62			1
the collection even includes a t - bar sandal named after her famous character			2
@entity1 has previously revealed that she wanted the pieces to be simple and that she and @entity61 have always shared the same vision			1
' there 's decades and decades and decades of incredible imagery that you probably have in your head that 's meaningful to you			0
' it just so happens that @entity61 and i shared the same period of interest , ' she said , ' i wanted to go back in time to the simple shoe , which is really hard to do well			1
that was really our point of inspiration			0
' @entity7 was known as much for the advice she would give her friends as the outlandish clothing that she would wear @entity1 spoke at length in the interview about her love for her family and how difficult it can be to work away from her children @entity1 wears a beautiful bow backed dress as she travelled to @entity94 for the shoot @entity1 covered @entity10 after travelling to @entity94 for the first week and with the collection , says @entity1 , comes great business experience : ' i ’ve learned about when things are complicated in business , how best to get a yes , ' she revealed to @entity101 's			1
' how to navigate relationships that are unfriendly , stressful , combative			0
i ’ve learned about private financing and business , and what their expectations are versus a publicly held company and a board			0
however whilst it is clear that @entity1 is incredibly successful that does n't stop her worrying about her family			1
she and her husband @entity112 , 52 , share three young children , @entity114 , 12 , and five - year - old twins @entity115 and @entity117			0
@entity1 , who at the time of the shoot was about to head to @entity120 for six weeks to shoot all roads lead to @entity122 , said it was difficult to be away from them whilst filming			1
' it ’s a really long time to be away from the children and i ’m getting a little bit anxious about it , just being gone is the ever - present conflict			2
' someone very clever said to me recently , ‘ the only reason you feel guilty is because you enjoy your work ’			0
i know they ’re going to be beyond fine , they ’re going to be great , but i worry and i miss them			0
' the film is a romantic comedy which sees @entity1 star as uptight @entity142 who travels with her former @entity120 lover @entity143 - to be played by @entity144 - as they chase her rebellious daughter across @entity120			1
@entity148 's own life however is more stable that @entity142 's something which she is eternally grateful for			0
' i ’m proud of my husband			0
i very much love watching him work , ' she said , ' i am extremely attached to my family and i feel lucky that we have found and created this life together			0
' when i think of my husband and children i also think of those that surround us , that we are privileged enough to call friends , they play such an intricate part in our lives			0
to talk about family for me is a wonderful meaningful group and without @entity112 i would n’t have found that particular group , so i feel very blessed			0
@entity1 always looks super chic on the red carpet , she wears a @entity171 jacket ( left ) and a @entity173 dress ( right ) to the opening night of it 's only a play on @entity177 @entity1 revealed how hard it can be to be away from her children in the interview			1
