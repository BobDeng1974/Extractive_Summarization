by @entity0 published : 04:47 est , 5 july 2013 updated : 05:02 est , 5 july 2013 action : some in the food industry believe stevia powder , which is 300 time sweeter than sugar but has no calories , could help tackle obesity it sounds too good to be true - all the sweetness of sugar but with none of the calories			1
but an extract from a plant found growing wild in @entity14 is being trumpeted as a major weapon in tackling the obesity crisis threatening the health of millions of people around the world			1
the natural sweetener called stevia is 300 times sweeter than traditional beet or cane sugar and could be a way for people with a sweet tooth to satisfy their sugar cravings totally guilt - free			1
dr @entity28 , a member of the @entity29 of the @entity30 , an information service provided by the main suppliers of stevia , believes the health benefits can not be understated			2
' @entity35 can help people enjoy natural - origin sweetness while reducing calories as part of a healthful , balanced diet , ' she told the @entity41			2
she added : ' there are enormous opportunities for industry to meet national and international pledges to reduce sugar in products to help the obesity crisis			1
' used for thousands of years in @entity14 cooking , it was added to food as a sweetener as well as a health tonic and treatment for high blood pressure , heartburn , gout and type 2 diabetes			1
now multi-national food companies are catching on to the possible benefits of stevia and are introducing it into to a range of low - calorie products			1
according to the @entity66 's 2013 statistics on @entity67 , @entity68 and @entity69 , 65 per cent of men and 58 per cent of women are overweight or obese in @entity72 , with the numbers continuing to rise			0
so the plant , used for centuries by @entity78 's @entity77 , it has shot from relative obscurity to being used as a key sweetener by large companies such as @entity82 and @entity83 in just a few years			1
sales of the extract have soared in recent years - up 400 per cent between 2008 and 2012			1
in 2011 it was approved by the @entity87 for widespread introduction			0
miracle plant : an extract from the leaves of a stevia bush are 300 times sweeter than sugar - but with none of the calories some critics have questioned if a calorie free supplement can possibly help in longterm fat loss diets			1
dr @entity99 , author of fat chance : the @entity101 , said that weight - loss diets might not be achieved because the body expects real sugar , the @entity41 reported			2
but this doubt over the effects of stevia has not stopped some food manufactures introducing the additive to some of their most popular ranges			1
in march , this year , fizzy drink @entity113 ditched its ' full - fat ' recipe in favour of a lower - calorie version that uses the ' natural ' sweetener			1
the new formulation of the popular beverage contains 30 per cent fewer calories - but fans fear it will have an unusual aftertaste			0
the drink is being altered as part of the parent company @entity82 's anti-obesity drive and follows a call by the government to address the issue			0
guilt - free : @entity35 , pictured being cultivated for use in the food industry , is being described as an ingredient which could help tackle obesity by cutting the calories in junk food and fizzy drinks a @entity82 spokesman said : ' we are introducing @entity113 with @entity35 in the @entity140			1
research into stevia ’s alleged health benefits have been mixed and many believe the plant could in fact pose health risks			1
some research has found that the plant lowered blood pressure			2
there has also been research into its effects on diabetes			0
the most obvious benefit of stevia is that it provides sweetness but does not elevate blood glucose levels as white sugar does			2
but in addition to this , early research has shown that it can actively lower blood sugars			0
scientists found that taking 1000 mg daily of stevioside reduced blood sugar levels after meals by up to 18 per cent in people with type 2 diabetes			2
other alleged benefits of stevia were analysed in a 2009 review of recent stevia research			2
experts at @entity175 in @entity176 found that a number of studies did show stevia to have blood pressure - lowering , anti-inflammatory , anti-tumour , anti-diarrheal , diuretic , and immunomodulatory actions			0
this will contain 30 per cent fewer calories and , instead of being added as a mid-calorie addition to the @entity113 range , it will completely replace the current @entity113 , ' it read			0
' @entity35 , a sweetener from natural origins , is sweeter than sugar but without the calories			1
' it is an extract from the leaf of the stevia plant which is native to @entity78			1
stevia has been used for centuries as a source of intense , natural sweetness			2
' the increasing introduction of the calourie - free natural sweetener comes amid mounting concern about the health effects of the soft drinks enjoyed by millions of @entity140 every day			1
heart attacks , diabetes , weight gain , brittle bones , pancreatic and prostate cancer , muscle weakness and paralysis have all been flagged up as potential problems of drinking soft drinks			0
earlier this year , a study warned that just one can of a sugary soft drink a day can raise the risk of diabetes by up to a fifth			0
a can of @entity82 contains around eight teaspoons of sugar and 139 calories			0
this is around 7 per cent of the 2,000 calories a woman is recommended per day			0
two cans would use up more than a tenth of a man ’s 2,500 daily calorie allowance			0
@entity234 ’s respected @entity233 warns that sugary drinks ‘ are a major contributor to the obesity epidemic ’			0
research it cites to back this up includes a 20 - year study of 120,000 men and women which found those that drank an extra soft drink a day gained , on average , a pound a year more than those that did not up their intake			0
over seven years , it would add up to half a stone .			0
