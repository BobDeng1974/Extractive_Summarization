that pot plant sat innocently on your desk may be more intelligent than you might think			2
scientists in @entity4 have discovered that one particular plant , the barberry , can choose whether to abort its seeds before they are ready to prevent parasitic infestations			1
this is because it has something called a ‘ structural memory ’ that helps it anticipate future events			1
if a parasite invades a barberry , the plant can abort its seeds to prevent infestation , according to new study the team at the @entity20 claims that this is ‘ the first ecological evidence of complex behaviour in plants ’			1
@entity25 's defence mechanism was discovered when researchers found that its relative , the @entity29 grape shrub , is infested with ten times as many @entity31 fruit flies			1
to understand why this was the case , 2,000 berries from different regions of @entity4 were collected , studied for signs of larval infestation and fed into a simulation			2
@entity25 's defence mechanism was discovered that its relative , the @entity29 grape shrub , which infested with ten times as many @entity31 fruit flies ( pictured ) as the @entity25 scientists discovered that , rather than have a knee jerk reaction , the barberry was able to fend of fruit flies with its ability to calculate probabilities			1
this parasite punctures the berries in order to lay its eggs inside them			0
if the larva is able to develop , it will often feed on all of the seeds in the berry			2
the plant seems to ‘ understand ’ that when it has two seeds - one infested and one intact - it 's a much better idea to release both before they are ripe to save the healthy seed			1
researchers found that the barberry did this three quarters of the time			2
@entity25 's defence mechanism was discovered when researchers found that its relative , the @entity29 grape shrub , is infested with ten times as many @entity31 fruit flies as the @entity25 when a fruit only bears one seed , and that ends up infested , the barberry only releases the mature seed five per cent of the time			1
‘ the seeds of the infested fruits are not always aborted , but rather it depends on how many seeds there are in the berries ’ , said dr @entity68			1
‘ this anticipative behaviour , whereby anticipated losses and outer conditions are weighed up , very much surprised us			0
‘ the message of our study is therefore that plant intelligence is entering the realms of ecological possibility			2
’ it is claimed sagebrush plants ( pictured ) send chemical messages through the air a previous study found that members of the vegetable kingdom can communicate with each other			0
they are ' capable of more sophisticated behaviour than we imagined , ' says @entity96 bug expert professor @entity95			0
his work , which he admits is ' controversial ' , suggested that plants converse by sending chemical messages through the air , warning of hungry predators			0
when a neighbouring plant ' hears ' the message , it boosts its defences against grasshoppers , caterpillars and other invaders , he believes			0
professor @entity95 , of the @entity111 , claimed to have proved that conversations happen between sagebrush bushes - hardy , yellow - flowered shrubs native to the western @entity96 using scissors , he clipped away at leaves and stems of potted shrubs , damaging them in the same way as a grasshopper would			0
he then planted some damaged and undamaged plants in a field and measured levels of predation on their neighbours			0
the leaves of the plants with clipped neighbours suffered the least grasshopper damage , according to the journal @entity129 .			0

@entity25 has ' structural memory ' that helps it anticipate future events
*75* per cent of the time the plant seems to understand that when it has two seeds - one *infected* and one intact - it 's a much better idea to release both
when a fruit only bears one seed , and that ends up infested , the @entity25 aborts only five per cent of the time
