@entity0 has become the most vilified woman in @entity2 , condemned as a compulsive liar and heartless mother who murdered her own daughter so she could spend her life shopping and partying			0
but with today 's sensational not - guilty verdict , the 25 - year - old could be free as early as thursday morning to begin the slow process of rebuilding her life - and cash in on her new - found celebrity status			1
there is already speculation the compelling case could be turned into a movie , and she is likely to be inundated with lucrative television and book deals worth millions of dollars			0
despite the acquittal of capital murder charges , the @entity22 family lawyer said it was too early to say if they would welcome @entity22 back			1
sheer relief : @entity0 reacts after she is found not guilty of murder in @entity30 today - but she will now have to pick up the pieces of her life and confront her family after a trial that ripped the @entity35 apart speaking after the verdict he said : ' the family hopes that they will be given the time by the media to reflect on this verdict and decide the best way to move forward privately			2
' although @entity22 smiled and broke into tears of delight as she learned she had escaped the death penalty , she is also likely to face the fear of attack from an angry public who were stunned by the jury 's decision			1
she will also have to confront her family , which was torn apart after her defence team dramatically accused both her father and brother of sexually abusing her			2
only one thing will be certain when she walks out of the @entity59 courtroom : @entity60 will never again live an anonymous life			1
@entity60 's trial , for the murder of her two - year - old daughter @entity0 in june 2008 , has captivated the nation			1
countless chat shows will give her the opportunity of telling her story for the first time - an offer she seems likely to take up , after her defence team had to dissuade her from giving testimony at the trial			0
and because she has been found not guilty , there is nothing to stop @entity60 selling her story to the highest bidder			1
adult entertainment company @entity77 has even offered her a career as a porn star			0
after her release , it is not clear where she will live , or how she will be reintegrated into society			0
what does the future hold ? @entity0 breaks down as the verdict is read out , left , and she breaks into a smile , right			0
she is now likely to be inundated with countless chat show offers and book deals stony - faced : in stark contrast to the scenes of jubilation , @entity91 and @entity60 were the first to leave the courtroom today , and remained emotionless as the verdict was read out she will face constant security fears , and it seems unlikely police will continue to provide protection after her release from jail			1
@entity60 found herself abandoned by many of her friends during her trial , who gave evidence saying she was proud of being a ' good liar ' , and even entered a ' hot body ' competition at a night club just days after defence lawyers claimed @entity0 drowned			1
it seems impossible that @entity60 could return to her parents ' @entity59 home , after the trial ripped the family apart with allegations of rape and incest			1
in a statement after the verdict , @entity91 and @entity60 described their daughter 's defence as ' baseless ' , but said they had achieved ' closure for this chapter of their life			1
@entity60 appears to have become close to her legal team , and she may stay with defence attorneys @entity134 or @entity136 , who wept after the not - guilty verdict was read out			1
her freedom means she could also resume the party - loving life for which the prosecution claimed she murdered her daughter			0
shocked : crowds of people gathered outside the courtroom for the verdict , and many were visibly stunned by the jury 's decision outrage : @entity150 expresses her shock to the amassed media outside the @entity153 despite the not - guilty verdict , @entity60 will face an upward struggle to clear her name			1
her trial attracted intense media attention , and there were even fights in the courtroom as angry members of the public attempted to catch a glimpse of the woman portrayed as a cold - hearted murderess			0
she was condemned by her own defence team in court as a liar , and the jury convicted her on four counts of deceiving police as she wove a web of lies following her daughter 's disappearance			0
although each of those misdemeanour counts carries up to a year in prison , she is likely to walk free at sentencing on thursday after having already spent three years in jail			1
@entity60 will struggle to rebuild her relationship with her parents			1
@entity91 and @entity60 stood by their daughter throughout the investigation and trial , risking foreclosure on their home by paying her legal bills			2
mrs @entity191 even tried to protect her daughter by apparently lying to the court , claiming she , rather than @entity22 , carried out searches for chloroform on the home computer			2
innocent victim : @entity0 , whose skeletal remains were found with evidence that her mouth and nose had been covered in duct tape but @entity60 's own lawyers dropped a bombshell which rocked the entire trial when they accused her father of sexually abusing her since the age of eight			2
they alleged @entity0 drowned in a swimming pool , and at her father 's insistence @entity60 tried to cover up the death			2
during testimony , the defence also questioned whether tests had been conducted to determine if @entity0 's brother @entity219 was the father of her daughter @entity0			0
the judge ordered her legal team not to mention the incest allegations in their closing arguments , but the shocking claims will make it impossible for the @entity35 to return to anything resembling a normal family life			2
winners : @entity231 and @entity232 speak to the media after their client @entity0 was sensationally spared the death penalty with a not guilty verdict for murder defeated : assistant state attorneys @entity238 and @entity240 sit at the prosecution table , seemingly in shock , after the verdict mr and mrs @entity191 were expressionless as the verdict was read out , and left the court as their daughter was still being embraced by her jubilant legal team			0
if she is released as expected on thursday , it is likely she will be looked after by her lawyers in the short - term			0
the @entity252 reported that she had just $ 94.49 in her bank account last wednesday , and she has largely been supported by her parents			0
but even before today 's verdict , @entity60 had received donations from wellwishers across the nation , allowing her to buy personal items while she was on trial , including shampoo , black mascara , nachos and bbq chips			2
she seems to have spent much of her time writing , ordering two boxes of 20 pens to be delivered to her prison cell during her trial			0
those wellwishers may come to her aid now , as she prepares herself for life outside prison for the first time in three years .			0

@entity22 could be free as early as thursday
