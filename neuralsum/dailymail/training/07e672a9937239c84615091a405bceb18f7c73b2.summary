by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter a four - year - old girl who was hit by a mysterious polio - like disease that left one of her arms paralyzed showed how the condition still affects her on monday evening			1
@entity9 , who was two when she was struck by the illness , smiled for the cameras and held up her paralyzed left arm as her family appeared at @entity14 at @entity15 in @entity16 , @entity17 for a press conference			1
' i was with her in the er when she was having difficulty breathing , ' her mother , @entity19 , from @entity20 , said			2
' i know we are so lucky that she 's here			2
' @entity25 became the first known case of the disease in 2012 , and since , 24 other children between the ages of two and 16 have been hit by the disease			1
all suffered paralysis of one or more arms or legs			1
public health officials have not yet identified any common causes connecting the cases			0
the illness is still being investigated and appears to be very unusual , but dr. @entity53 warned on monday that any child showing a sudden onset of weakness in their limbs or symptoms of paralysis should be immediately seen by a doctor			1
' the disease resembles but is not the same as polio , ' he said			2
' but this is serious			0
most of the children we 've seen so far have not recovered use of their arm or their leg			1
' this is the case for @entity25 , who first developed what looked like asthma two years ago			0
her mother told @entity77 that she rushed @entity25 to the hospital after she started wheezing and vomiting			0
she spent four days in hospital after being diagnosed with asthma and was discharged - but @entity19 said she knew something else was wrong			0
struck down : @entity25 , from @entity20 , @entity17 , had the first known case of the illness in 2012 in hospital : @entity38 , who was two when she was struck by the disease , suffered breathing problems and loss use of her left arm			1
her mother said she thought they were going to lose her the toddler had full use of her left arm when she left the hospital but 24 hours later at a follow - up appointment , @entity19 noticed the girl was n't moving her left arm - and it has remained paralyzed			1
' you can imagine , ' her mother said at the press conference			1
' we had two boys that are very healthy , and @entity25 was healthy until that point			0
we did not realize what we were in store for			0
we did not realize her arm would be permanently paralyzed			0
' before the development of a vaccine in 1955 , some 20,000 @entity47 children were infected with the illness every year			1
the virus mostly affected children under the age of three , which is why it was also called infantile paralysis			1
polio is spread from person to person , mainly through ingesting contaminated food or water			0
most who become infected with the virus are asymptomatic , meaning they do n't even get sick			0
but one to five in 1000 cases can experience paralyzation			0
most paralyzation cases are caused by spinal polio which leads to paralysis in the legs , and unfortunately for those who caught spinal polio before the immunization , there was no cure and paralysis was permanent			1
polio has since been eradicated in @entity47 and most of the world			0
only three countries have had polio uninterrupted : @entity142 , @entity143 and @entity144			0
in the @entity47 , children receive four doses of the inactive polio vaccine ( @entity148 ) to guard against the illness			1
@entity25 has undergone intense physical and occupational therapy to restore function to her arm , but nothing helped			0
she had surgery nerve transplant in april 2013 but @entity19 says the family may have to wait a further two - and - a - half years before they know if it was effective			1
right now , @entity25 's arm is completely flaccid and her muscles are shriveled from lack of use			2
@entity25 improved little after her illness and now has a paralyzed left arm , weakness in her left leg and some breathing problems			1
otherwise , she is a happy , healthy pre-schooler , and @entity19 is grateful the mystery illness was n't worse			2
' we know we are lucky that the virus did not affect other areas of her spine as that may have caused paralysis of her legs or worse , all four limbs , ' she said on monday			2
doctors are not sure if her illness was a virus or something else			0
@entity53 said he has studied five cases from @entity183 up through the @entity184 , including two that were identified as the disease enterovirus - 68 , which is from the same family as the polio viruses			1
he said there have been about 20 cases statewide			0
' we want to temper the concern , because at the moment , it does not appear to represent a major epidemic but only a very rare phenomenon , ' he said , noting similar outbreaks in @entity197 and @entity198			0
@entity53 , who diagnosed @entity25 , said polio vaccines do not protect children from the disease , but he stressed that it is still important for children to receive that vaccine			2
dr. @entity205 of the @entity206 in @entity207 said monday that the research is still underway in @entity17 , and there are a variety of infectious diseases that can cause childhood paralysis			1
concerned : @entity25 's mother @entity19 , pictured , said the family initially had no idea she would never be able to use her arm ever again			1
@entity25 's father and two brothers ( one obscured , left ) joined them relief : @entity19 added that they were just glad that they did not lose @entity25 to the mystery illiness any of a number of illnesses could be at work , and it 's possible some of the cases had one infection and some had another			2
regarding the presence of @entity234 in at least two cases , " it could be an incidental finding , " @entity205 said			0
until officials get more information , @entity205 said they are not looking around the country for similar cases of @entity234			0
the @entity240 has not identified any common causes that suggest that the cases are linked , said dr. @entity243 , the deputy director of the @entity244 and state epidemiologist			2
' physicians and public health officials who have encountered similar illnesses have submitted 20 reports to @entity240 , and @entity240 has conducted preliminary tests on 15 of these specimens , ' he said			1
mid-century disease : iron lungs in the @entity254 in @entity255 during the @entity257 epidemic sweeping @entity258 in 1955			0
the vaccination was developed that year and children now receive four doses ' thus far , the department has not identified any common causes that suggest that the cases are linked			0
' @entity266 , @entity184 , neurology professor @entity265 said doctors believe , but do n't have proof , that it 's a virus that for most children shows up only as a benign cold			2
she said a few children , due to their biological makeup , are having much more serious symptoms and she hoped doctors would look for them			2
' for a lot of the neurologists who have trained in the last 30 years , it 's extremely rare to see polio or polio - like syndrome , ' she said .			1
