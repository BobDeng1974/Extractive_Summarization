by @entity0 and @entity1 and @entity2 @entity1 the faces of nine of the 13 surrogate babies @entity7 police suspect are fathered by a @entity9 businessman have been revealed			1
in a press conference on tuesday , the children at the centre of the latest surrogacy controversy were brought to the forefront as authorities crackdown on @entity7 's surrogacy trade			2
the sudden surge in scandals of this nature emerging comes after @entity2 couple @entity20 and @entity21 were accused of leaving baby @entity22 behind with his @entity7 surrogate mother when they found out he had down syndrome			1
last friday , police found four more babies they believed were fathered by the @entity9 businessman who has since fled @entity7			1
officers did not release any more information about the children or where they were found , according to the @entity43			0
this latest development brings the total number of babies related to the businessman found in @entity48 in the same week to 13			1
another nine were found after police raided a @entity48 apartment earlier in same week and found nine babies aged from several weeks to one year			1
the 24 - year - old man , accused of being embroiled in a surrogate ' baby farming ' racket , was allowed to leave the country , carrying an infant , on a @entity9 passport , according to @entity57			1
police colonel @entity58 told @entity59 the alleged father of the children had travelled ' in and out of @entity48 many times '			1
the @entity2 consulate in @entity7 issues passports to surrogate babies born to @entity2 biological parents the revelation came when police descended on a clinic in the @entity7 capital on friday that was believed to have provided the in vitro fertilisation ( @entity72 ) service to conceive the babies after receiving a tip from one of the surrogates			1
police believe the clinic - which was empty and had no documents left over - had violated the code of conduct relating to their licence to perform the procedure			2
a second clinic owned by the same doctor was also searched by police on friday			2
the penalty for such offences could see the clinic 's doctor jailed for up to one year and face a fine of up to $ 671			0
but if they were not certified to perform surrogacy , the doctor could face an extra three years ' jail and see a fine of more than $ 2,000			0
this comes after @entity7 officials criticised the @entity102 's role in feeding the controversial surrogacy trade in @entity7 by allowing agencies to play a part in the citizenship process			2
due to the high demand of surrogate - born babies in @entity7 , the @entity107 claims it is finding it practically impossible to regulate the movement of newborns leaving the country on foreign passports - set - up in part by the surrogate agencies themselves			1
all passport documentation is handled by surrogate agencies before it is processed by @entity2 immigration , and this is proving problematic for the @entity107 because it keeps the controversial industry profitable			2
it also makes it difficult for @entity7 officials to keep track of babies born by surrogacy leaving which leave the country			1
@entity128 of the attorney - generals @entity129 said the @entity107 does not have records of when prospective parents enter as a couple and leave as a family - but it should			0
' the @entity136 couples come in as two and walk out as three , with a @entity7 child , ' @entity128 told @entity57			0
he said this makes it particularly difficult to keep track of the legally ' grey ' surrogate trade when their is no stringent immigration checks at the border			0
' @entity148 should have records - this is totally bizarre to us , ' mr @entity128 said			0
@entity150 is the birth mother of baby @entity22 who is embroiled in a @entity7 - @entity2 surrogacy scandal his comments come almost two weeks after the global uproar of baby @entity22 , and since then the @entity7 government announced 100 clinics and hospitals had carried out thousands of unregulated in vitro procedures on local mothers for foreign biological western parents			1
a spokesman for immigration minister @entity161 said yesterday that @entity2 citizenship laws does not differentiate how a child came to be born if he or she is the descent of an @entity2 passport holder			0
“ the @entity167 2007 does not differentiate how a child came to be born , ' he said			0
' any application for @entity2 citizenship by descent is predicated on the link between parent and child			0
' he said over the over the past five years , more than 800 citizenship - by - descent applications involving surrogacy arrangements ( from all countries ) have been approved			0
the legal situation of @entity2 with recent or pending surrogate births still in @entity7 has not yet been clarified by the @entity182 interim military government			1
the @entity129 's advice to @entity2 intending to use foreign surrogacy services is to check host country ’s laws and visa arrangements			2
the advice also states people should : ' extreme caution is exercised by the @entity2 government in cases involving surrogacy arrangements that are entered into overseas , so as to ensure that @entity2 ’s citizenship and passport provisions are not used to circumvent either adoption laws or other child welfare laws			0
