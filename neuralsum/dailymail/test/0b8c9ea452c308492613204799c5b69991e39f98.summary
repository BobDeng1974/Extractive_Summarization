@entity1 's ambitions of persuading @entity2 to release @entity3 for another loan deal at @entity6 next season are well documented			1
but what you wish for and what you get are often oceans apart and so may be the case regarding @entity3 after the pronouncements from @entity2 on thursday			1
put simply , manager @entity12 has confessed that his club 's young @entity14 players are not yet ready to step into his first - team squad			1
therefore the likes of @entity3 may soon find themselves returning from loan deals to fill the gap			2
@entity3 has impressed while playing for @entity1 on loan this season from @entity2 @entity1 are keen to retain the services of the 19 - year - old @entity24 defender , but face an uphill struggle to do so city manager @entity12 has confirmed that the club are looking to invest in homegrown talent @entity12 's comments confirm that @entity2 will be required to invest heavily in ' homegrown ' talent this summer			1
current @entity32 regulations require clubs to carry a minimum eight homegrown players , a group which can include youngsters who have spent three of their formative years at an @entity39 club			0
@entity3 falls into this category despite hailing from @entity24 - making him all the more attractive to @entity2 next season			1
@entity12 said : ' i think about the @entity14 , we must be patient			0
this club build all these things because young players are important			0
' maybe it 's not so easy for young players , especially at big clubs , to play in the first team , with the professional squad			0
' i 'm sure in the future we will have very important players coming from the @entity14 , they will be part of the squad			0
' but it 's important to be patient , important to have years of working the same way			0
maybe some talented young players can do it before			0
' @entity3 would obviously fit the bill			2
a number of young @entity2 professionals , including @entity64 's @entity63 and @entity65 with @entity66 , are on loan and may be brought back to plug some of the holes next season			1
