his playmate , five - year - old @entity34 was equally excited by the snow and attempted to walk a snow - covered branch			2
playtime : but @entity26 did n't appear too disheartened and refused to let go of the tyre while licking snow off his paw going for a tumble : @entity26 makes a crash landing after going for a swing on the tyre balancing act : @entity26 's slightly more adventurous playmate , five - year - old @entity34 attempts to cross a snow - covered branch giant pandas are solitary bears when in the wild , usually preferring their own company when foraging in @entity15 bamboo forests			1
