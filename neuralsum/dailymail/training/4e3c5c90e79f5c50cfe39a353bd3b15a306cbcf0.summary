by @entity1 reporter published : 07:24 est , 5 april 2012 updated : 08:32 est , 5 april 2012 an 11 - year - old boy has gone where many of the best economic minds in @entity5 have feared to tread and proposed a radical solution to the euro 's problems - using a pizza as his inspiration			1
@entity12 ' entry in the £ 250,000 @entity13 - an international competition to find the ' best contingency plan for a break - up of the euro ' - won special mention from judges			1
@entity12 , of @entity20 in the @entity21 , was 10 at the time he entered			1
sorting them all out : @entity12 , 11 , ( right ) pictured here with father @entity24 ( left ) has proposed a radical solution to the euro 's problems - using a pizza as his inspiration the plan : @entity12 ' entry to the £ 250,000 @entity13 - an international competition to find the ' best contingency plan for a break - up of the euro ' - is pictured here he has been given a € 100 gift voucher for his efforts but unfortunately failed to make the final short list of five			1
@entity12 ' suggestion was that @entity37 be given drachmas in exchange for their euros and that anyone moving euros out of @entity37 should be penalised			1
he wrote : ' all @entity37 people should bring their euro to the bank			1
they put it in an exchange machine ...			2
you see , the @entity37 guy does not look happy ! ' the @entity37 man gets back @entity37 drachme from the bank , their old currency			2
the bank gives all these euros to the @entity37 government			2
' all these euros together form a pancake or a pizza			2
now the @entity37 government can start to pay back all their debts , everyone who has a debt gets a slice of the pizza			2
' you see that all these euros in the pizzas go the companies and banks who have given loans in @entity37			2
' @entity72 : @entity12 was 10 at the time he entered the competition his father @entity24 told @entity75 he was proud his son thought about the world 's problems and came up with solutions			1
but he revealed @entity12 did not want to become an economist when he was older , and would rather pursue his love of animals in becoming a zoo director			1
@entity84 and @entity85 , my name is @entity12			1
i am 10 years old and live in the @entity21			2
i am quite worried about the eurocrisis and look at the tv news daily			2
the eurocrisis is a big problem			2
since i read in the newspaper about your price , i thought that i would like to submit my idea			2
so here it is : i made a picture of my solution and i will explain it to you			2
@entity37 should leave the @entity102			2
how do you do that ? all @entity37 people should bring their @entity102 to the bank			2
they put it in an exchange machine ( see left on my picture )			2
you see , the @entity37 guy does not look happy ! ! the @entity37 man gets back @entity112 from the bank , their old currency			0
the @entity115 gives all these euro 's to the @entity117 ( see topleft on my picture )			1
all these euros together form a pancake or a pizza ( see on top in the picture )			0
now the @entity37 government can start to pay back all their debts , everyone who has a debt gets a slice of the pizza			0
you see that all these euro 's in the pizza 's go the companies and banks who have given loans in greece ( see right in my picture ) now here comes the clever part of my idea : the @entity37 people do not want to exchange their @entity102 's for @entity141 because they know that this @entity112 will lose its value dramatically			1
they try to keep or hide their @entity102 's			0
they know that if they wait a while they will get more @entity144			0
so if a @entity37 man tries to keep his @entity102 ( or bring his euros to a bank in an other country like @entity150 orn @entity151 ) and it is discovered , he gets a penalty just as high or double as the whole amount in euros he tried to hide ! ! ! in this way i ensure that all @entity37 bring their euros to a greek bank and so the greek government can pay back all the debts			0
i hope my idea helps you ! ! ! ! of course if a country has paid back all his debts , he can return to the eurozone			0
a bit more about myself : i am 10 , love animals since i have a dog and a bird			0
i live in a family of 5 in @entity150			0
i have 5 friends with whom i play all day , mostly outside			0
@entity172 : my father helped me with my @entity175 translation as i speak @entity21 greetings from @entity150 , @entity12 * all spellings sic he also said his son wanted the euro to continue , and that he used a pizza to explain his plan because it was one of his favourite foods			1
his prize money , he added , will probably be spent on games in a toy shop			0
the competition comes as the 17 - country single currency union continues to be placed under considerable strain by the crippling debt problems of some of its members			1
some europe - watchers have warned that any country 's exit from the eurozone would destabilise the rest of @entity5 and plunge the region into a deep recession			1
on the other side , ' euroskeptics ' argue that the currency union 's problems are so great that an orderly break - up with countries going back to their old currencies , such as the @entity37 drachma and @entity210 lira , is the best answer			1
the prize , was has attracted 425 entries , has been sponsored by a family charity trust of conservative peer lord @entity216 and is being run by the think tank @entity218			0
@entity216 said at the announcement of the shortlist : ' sadly , the risk of a country leaving the eurozone has not gone away			1
' the ideas contained in these entries are an invaluable contribution to tackling this important issue			0
' the prize 's five shortlisted finalists will each receive £ 10,000 pounds to continue their work ahead of the prize 's award on july 5			1
@entity233 and his team of @entity235 in @entity236 said any country leaving the euro would convert its government and consumer debt into its own currency - such as the @entity37 drachma			1
the country would then deliberately default to bring its debt levels down to 60 percent of its economic output			0
@entity249 private investor @entity247 said the process which created the euro should basically be reversed			1
all claims in the exiting country would be replaced by claims in the new currency			0
@entity256 and @entity257 of @entity258 in @entity236 said that if a country quits the euro , @entity249 law would not recognise debt contracts in the country 's new currency			1
a new way of handling and dealing in these debt contracts would have to be introduced			0
@entity267 , of @entity268 , said that if one country leaves the euro , the currency has to be dissolved			1
he thus argues for maintaining secrecy for as long as possible before announcing a breakup plan , to prevent markets from attacking structural weaknesses in other countries			1
and @entity278 , of @entity280 - based @entity279 , said that as many currency unions have failed in the past a euro break - up would not be especially challenging			1
using past examples as a guide , countries should exit by surprise over a weekend , declare an extra bank holiday or two around the date of the exit and stamp the existing currency until new notes are circulated			0
today , the sovereign debt crisis continued to hit @entity5 , with stock markets failing to hold on to early gains as investors fretted about @entity297 's debt problems			0
problems : today , the sovereign debt crisis continued to hit @entity5 , with stock markets failing to hold on to early gains as investors fretted about @entity297 's debt problems a disappointing set of @entity297 bond auctions yesterday contributed to a big rout on global stock markets			0
@entity297 has become the latest point of concern in @entity5 's debt crisis as investors are concerned over the ability of the government to push through its big austerity programme at a time when its economy is heading for a return to recession and unemployment is standing at around 23 per cent			0
the yield on the country 's 10 - year bond pushed up a further 0.07 percentage point to 5.73 per cent , a sign that investors are wary of @entity297 's ability to avoid suffering the same bailout fate as @entity37 , @entity322 and @entity323			1
' the eurozone crisis remains unresolved and @entity297 remains in the spotlight with bond yields moving higher after yesterday 's disappointing bond auction , ' said @entity328 , global macro strategist at @entity329			0
investors in @entity5 also have crucial @entity332 jobs data on tomorrow on their minds			0
though much of @entity5 is off for @entity335 , @entity332 markets are open and the centrepiece during the session will be the monthly non-farm payrolls figures for march			0
given that the payrolls data often set the market tone for a week or two after their release , investors are reining in their exposure			0
in @entity5 , the ftse 100 index of leading @entity249 shares was down 0.7 per cent at 5,666 while @entity151 's @entity345 fell 1 per cent to 6,713			1
the @entity346 in @entity347 was 1 per cent lower too at 3,281			0
in the current risk - averse trading environment , the euro took a further knock , trading 0.5 per cent lower at $ 1.3068			1
@entity351 was poised for further losses at the open too with both @entity354 futures and the broader @entity356 futures down 0.3 per cent			0
earlier in @entity359 , @entity358 's nikkei 225 index slipped 0.5 per cent to close at 9,767.61 while @entity361 's @entity360 fell 1 per cent to 20,593 .			0
