with monday night ’s @entity2 tie between @entity3 and @entity4 live on the @entity5 , it might be best if the first challenge involving @entity7 and @entity8 takes place after the 9pm watershed			1
the reputation of both precedes them ; @entity13 committing more fouls than any other player in @entity17 history and ‘ elbows ’ @entity8 leaving a trail of victims over the past seven years in @entity21			1
at nearly 38 , @entity7 has reached the age where he feels free to say what he thinks			1
in the case of @entity8 , that is not very much			1
@entity3 striker @entity7 is preparing to face @entity4 in the @entity2 on monday the veteran striker trains at @entity27 ahead of monday night 's visit of @entity4 @entity7 celebrates after scoring his 150th career goal against @entity30 last weekend ‘ he caught me under the eye last time we played and it popped up like a balloon			1
i would liked to have given him the benefit of the doubt but it was a bit naughty			2
‘ i know it was intentional , ’ says @entity7 , relishing the prospect of meeting him again			1
the clash came at a @entity44 - @entity43 game in 2011			1
‘ he was screening me at a goal - kick			2
@entity46 always put an extra player in front of me and , as the kick came in , @entity8 caught me as i went up to jump			1
he did n’t jump , his arm shot up instead			2
@entity7 is relishing coming up against old foe @entity8 ( left ) again ‘ away fans have a pop at me for my style but if i know i have caught someone i will go over and say sorry			1
there are going to be collisions when you jump to make challenges			0
but in more than 800 games i have never intentionally hurt someone			0
’ @entity8 ’s size and power were used by @entity66 to see off another lower league side , @entity68 , in the last round , so it would be no surprise if the @entity72 was drafted in again to try to sort out @entity3 , particularly with @entity73 nursing a knock , @entity75 struggling in front of goal , @entity78 untried and @entity79 being used in midfield			1
smarter and more sensitive than his battering - ram image would suggest , @entity7 is enjoying being centre - stage again			1
when @entity44 decided not to renew his contract in 2013 , many wondered if it was the end of the road for the veteran , who spent two decades at @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92 and , finally , wanderers			1
instead , @entity3 manager @entity94 and chairman @entity95 bombarded him with calls and texts , even during their summer holidays			1
‘ they made me feel wanted which was important , ’ says @entity7			1
‘ you have to dream in football and here we are , about to face the biggest club in @entity105			2
and @entity4 have been significant in his career			1
@entity7 was a 20 - year - old hotshot with @entity90 when he first played against them , scoring the winner past @entity110 but also sustaining an injury he believes may have cost him 50 @entity21 caps			1
‘ it was my first season in the @entity17 , he says			0
‘ i was full of confidence and playing without fear — like @entity117 is now			0
@entity7 scores against @entity4 in 1997 before an injury that blighted his @entity21 career the former @entity44 striker has committed more fouls than any other player in @entity17 history @entity7 celebrates victory for @entity44 over @entity125 in the @entity2 sixth round in 2011 ‘ i scored early — my 12th of the season			1
then @entity128 and myself had a collision by the halfway line			0
it was n’t malicious but i ended up with ankle ligament damage			0
by the final whistle , i was already in hospital for a scan			0
it had a lot of repercussions			0
i came back too early and my ankle went again at @entity140 and i missed my chance of going to the @entity142			0
‘ i do think about it			0
i was playing so well at the time , in the @entity144			0
without that tackle , i could have got in the full squad and ended up with 50 caps			0
i still think i ’m a better footballer than @entity148 ( who won 62 caps )			0
’ eighteen years later , @entity7 ’s right ankle is still heavily swollen and is the subject of curiosity from his current colleagues			2
instead of going to @entity154 98 as an understudy for @entity156 , @entity7 had to wait until he was 33 before making his only @entity21 appearance , in a @entity159 qualifier against @entity160 at @entity161			1
he came on as a substitute for @entity163 to partner @entity79 , @entity4 ’s captain against him tomorrow			2
‘ i was pumped up so i started shouting , “ @entity166 , let ’s get this going ” , ’ he recalls			0
‘ he looked bemused but i needed his help to try and stay in the team ! ’ unfortunately for @entity7 , the game finished 0 - 0 and he did not win a second cap			2
but compensation arrived in a fantastic club career , particularly at @entity44 , where he is regarded as their greatest forward since @entity176			1
united memories come tumbling out			0
his @entity44 debut ended up in a 4 - 0 defeat at @entity180			2
‘ @entity181 made his first appearance in the same game , ’ he says			0
‘ i ’d never heard of him — but it did n’t take long to find out			0
’ @entity7 made his first and only appearance for @entity21 at 33 in a @entity187 qualifier against @entity160 the 37 - year - old will be counting on all of his experience to cause a massive upset in the @entity2 the well - travelled striker has no intention of hanging up his boots just yet there was also the embarrassment of being spotted on camera after a game asking for a signed shirt from @entity79			1
‘ it was for my son @entity200 , ’ he says			0
‘ my youngest one , @entity201 , will be a mascot tomorrow			0
he ’s five and i did ask him if he ’d prefer to walk out with me or @entity79 ! he had to think about it but he did say me			0
’ professionally , @entity7 is in a good place			2
he scored his 150th career goal at @entity30 last weekend , got a bloodied nose and two assists at @entity89 on tuesday and has proved a good mentor for @entity3 striker @entity209 , who has 14 goals already this season			2
but three months ago , @entity7 was sure this would be his last season as a player			1
@entity3 ’s @entity2 run and promotion push , however , have reinvigorated him			1
‘ i want to carry on , ’ he says			0
‘ i ’m playing , i ’m contributing , i have n’t put on any weight and my joints are n’t hurting			0
if @entity3 want to keep me , fantastic			2
if they do n’t , hopefully other offers come in			0

@entity4 face @entity3 in the @entity2 fifth round
@entity7 is looking forward to *battling* @entity8 again
