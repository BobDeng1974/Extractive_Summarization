for @entity0 , february brings the mouth - watering prospect of cup ties against historic foes @entity4 and @entity6			1
sandwiched in between the hotly - anticipated @entity9 semi-final and @entity10 last 32 tie is the small matter of a @entity13 visit of @entity14			1
as the club ’s make - or - break month approaches , manager @entity15 admits he can sense fear in the air			1
but the terror he detects is not emanating from his @entity22 players , but from their domestic rivals , anxious at facing a @entity0 side peaking at the right time			1
@entity15 cited the way @entity27 set out for a goalless draw at @entity22 on wednesday night , only to lose 4 - 0 as @entity0 returned to the summit of the @entity30 , as proof that teams are becoming worried at the damage they could sustain at the hands of the champions			1
@entity0 manager @entity15 believes his team are peaking at the perfect time ahead of frenetic february @entity15 takes his position as he prepares to lead @entity0 into battle on four fronts next month @entity0 eased back to the @entity30 summit with wednesday night 's 4 - 0 demolition of @entity27 1 @entity4 ( @entity44 ) @entity9 semi-final 7 @entity14 ( a ) @entity46 14 @entity47 ( a ) 19 @entity6 ( @entity48 ) @entity10 round of 32 , first leg @entity51 ( @entity48 ) 26 @entity6 ( a ) @entity10 round of 32 , second leg the @entity53 expects more of the same blend of fear and respect at @entity57 on saturday lunchtime , after the @entity60 side parked the bus and stole a point in @entity63 on december 27			1
but as @entity15 continues to targets a domestic treble , he wants to ensure january ends with a perfect 12 points from 12 ahead of a month he hopes does not end up defining his first season in charge in @entity71			1
‘ february is going to be a very big month for us , ’ smiled the @entity0 manager			1
they are going to be very interesting games ( against @entity4 , @entity6 and @entity14 )			1
the month could define the season but hopefully it wo n’t because trophies do n’t come in february			1
hopefully we can extend our run in the competitions beyond next month			2
‘ i think i am more confident now about my team than i was two or three months ago			2
i think we are growing more and more together			2
' we understand what we expect from each other , the players and me			2
that gives me more confidence and i see more confidence in the players			2
they are also much fitter and sharper than they were before			2
@entity93 celebrates with @entity94 after scoring one of his two goals in the 4 - 0 @entity27 win @entity98 jumps for joy after making it 2 - 0 to @entity0 shortly before half - time @entity0 's @entity102 sees a shot creep just wide of the post during the match at @entity22 ‘ i think ( the @entity27 game ) in particular shows that people fear us more than they did before ! and , to me , that is good to see			1
we will have to deal with breaking teams down , like @entity27			1
@entity57 did the same to us at home and i think it will be a quite similar match on saturday			1
‘ confidence is a very important thing in football			2
when you win games you get more and more confidence			2
so to win up in the north is so important because it will give us confidence going into the @entity4 match			1
‘ i ’m home a lot , so i do n’t get people talking to me much about the @entity4 game			1
but i get it when i come into training			0
i know what it is about			0
but i ’m taking it a match at a time just now			0
for me , the league is the most important thing and the first target is beating @entity57			1
’ after @entity0 dropped points at home to the @entity138 last month , @entity135 took advantage of the champions postponed game at @entity142 to go clear at the top of the table			1
but @entity15 ’s side have responded by winning each game since their return from @entity148 and reclaimed their place at the summit on wednesday night			1
@entity15 applauds the @entity0 fans at the end of their 4 - 0 win over @entity27 on wednesday @entity93 scores two goals in the comfortable win , guiding @entity0 back to the top of the table that came days after @entity135 ’s eight game run of wins without conceding came to a halt in a 3 - 3 home draw with @entity14			1
now @entity15 suggests it is @entity135 ’s turn to see how they deal with questions being asked of their own title bid			1
‘ i think @entity135 have a very good team			0
they should be up there , ’ he said			0
‘ they have had consistency in their team over the period and they have improved			0
they can win a lot of games			2
‘ but it is always the same when you are up there fighting for titles that you have to bounce back quick			0
you ca n’t have long periods with bad results			0
you need to maintain a high level over a whole season			0
' now we will see if we can do it and if @entity135 can do it , or @entity187 , @entity188 or whoever			0
we will see in april if it is two teams or three teams or just one ( in the title race )			0
’ it ’s not long since striker @entity194 was boasting of his plans to become the first @entity0 player to score a hat - trick against @entity4 since @entity198 at the same stage of the @entity9 in 1973			1
despite his iniital 11 goals in 18 appearances on loan from @entity204 , however , the @entity200 is without a goal in his last six matches and was unused in the rout of @entity27			2
@entity194 scored 11 goals in 18 appearances during his loan spell , but did n't feature against @entity27 @entity98 is expected to get the nod again when @entity0 travel to @entity57 on saturday in his absence , @entity98 scored a goal and is expected to be given the nod against @entity57 tomorrow with the chance to stake a claim for an @entity219 starting berth			1
whatever happens in @entity60 , @entity98 – who once looked on his way out of @entity22 – has already impressed @entity15 with his attitude , fitness and a left foot the @entity0 boss yesterday labelled ‘ world class ’			1
‘ i think @entity98 ’s a very exciting player , ’ @entity15 said			2
‘ his left foot is world class			0
i ’ve not seen any player have a better left foot in my life			0
he has skills but you have to perform over time when you play at @entity0			1
‘ @entity98 looks sharp but he needs more confidence			0
the goal against @entity27 was very important			2
i would n’t play him if i wanted him to leave			2
we made some demands of him and he has really worked hard to tune into that			0
he still needs to improve , everybody does , but he is getting to a new level			0
‘ his fitness is 100 per cent better than it was and you can see that in matches			0
he works really hard to close people down			0
‘ it started with him giving 100 per cent in training			0
that ’s why he got his chance in the team			0
‘ @entity98 is also a fantastic guy			0
he is always in a good mood and you get a laugh in the dressing room – but he is also hungry to learn			0
‘ now he has played the last two games for us and we have won and he has played well			0
so he is in a better position than three or four weeks ago			0
it ’s clear to see we have big competition for places up front			0
