per @entity2 remains confident @entity1 's consistent performance levels will eventually see them claw back lost ground in the @entity5 title race			1
the @entity6 looked set for a comfortable afternoon when they took an early lead through a fine finish by @entity9 against @entity10 at the @entity11 on saturday , only to quickly be pegged back by a controversial equaliser from @entity13 , who looked to have pulled @entity14 in the build - up			1
a lapse in concentration at the start of the second half saw @entity20 - drafted into the starting xi following injury to @entity23 in the warm - up - head the visitors in front			0
per mertesacker claims he has seen enough of @entity1 to know they can climb back up the table @entity31 's side , who have been hit by a series of injuries , continued to press as @entity10 sat deep , but appeared set to be frustrated before @entity35 swept the ball home in the first minute of stoppage time			1
@entity1 , who came from 2 - 0 down to beat @entity10 in the 2014 fa cup final , almost snatched victory during the additional six minutes added on by referee @entity43 as full - back @entity44 ghosted in at the far post , but he was denied by a point - blank save from substitute goalkeeper @entity47			1
it is now just one victory in their past seven league matches for @entity1 , who were beaten at @entity53 before the international break and find themselves 11 points adrift of the leaders			1
@entity2 , though , feels he has seen enough in recent performances to believe @entity1 can soon build some momentum of their own			2
@entity35 lifts the ball past substitute keeper @entity47 to hand @entity1 a crucial point against @entity10 ' we have to take the responsibility for that , to have dropped points again , but what really makes me confident is the way that we play at the moment , because no matter what happens , we just carry on and have great potential , that just has to come out much more , ' said @entity2 , who captained the team on sunday with @entity72 on the bench following a calf injury			1
' we started really well and put the pressure on them , did a great job to score that opener and were really confident to keep on going like that , but they came back all of a sudden			0
' for me , the decision ( to disallow the first goal ) was clear , everybody had stopped already because he pulled @entity14 seriously , but the referee thought it would be his strength which had brought him back into the action			0
@entity1 's vice-captain believed @entity10 's first goal should have been disallowed for a foul on @entity14 ' afterwards , we kept on going , even after they had scored the second			1
with the crowd together , we were able to come back and draw that match			0
' we nearly scored a third , which would have been more lovely , but at least we have one point and good morale			0
' @entity14 knows @entity1 ' have to fix something ' if they are to challenge			2
' we will try to find a solution for the next games , ' he said			0
' at the moment we are having a bad period , but we did n't lose			0
' we came back , so it was great character and very important to recover well with another game on wednesday ( away to @entity105 in the @entity106 )			0
' @entity9 was a bright spark for @entity1 in front of their fans , but even he showed his frustration @entity111 revealed he had opted against starting with @entity20 because of the @entity113 's travel schedule during the international break , one of several @entity10 players away			2
' we deserved maybe to hang on , but a lot of them have been all over the world this week and we were running on empty , ' he said			0
' the first goal was an individual piece of grappling , maybe we have got a ( fortunate ) decision , but you do n't get many of them at @entity1 so it was a good one to have , but i would rather talk about our second goal because it was an excellent team goal			2
' @entity10 will assess @entity23 and also defender @entity129 ( ankle ) , but goalkeeper @entity131 looks set for an extended spell on the sidelines with the torn bicep which forced @entity111 to introduce @entity47			2
@entity20 celebrates after giving @entity10 the lead against @entity1 at the @entity11 on saturday			1

@entity1 drew 2 - 2 with @entity10 at the @entity11
@entity35 's late goal earned @entity31 's side a draw
