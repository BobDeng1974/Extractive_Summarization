one was the @entity1 president , the other was a loner , and yet by chance there was one woman who knew them both			1
@entity7 knew @entity8 as a senator , when she advised him on @entity10			1
she interviewed @entity11 years later when she was a @entity12 correspondent for the @entity13			1
despite decades of speculation in books , articles and documentaries , she remains certain @entity11 committed the crime			1
and @entity8 , she says , would ' want to know why this young man had nothing better to do than go out and shoot someone			2
' i was sorry for him because he seemed lost and as if he really did n't know what to do - @entity7 on @entity11 ms @entity7 was living in @entity34 in 1959 when she was asked by @entity1 embassy officials to reason with a dissident			1
coerced into meeting the former @entity37 by negotiators who thought he might respond better to a woman , she was struck by how young he looked			0
' he thought he was a great man who was going to assert himself for history , ' she told @entity44 , recalling her six - hour interview with @entity11 in her hotel room during his bid to renounce his @entity1 citizenship to move to the @entity49			1
' he looked like a college boy , ' she said			0
' i was sorry for him because he seemed lost and as if he really did n't know what to do			0
' infamous : 50 years ago today , president @entity8 lay dead in the back seat of the @entity56 limousine as it sped along @entity58 ; his wife @entity59 climbs onto the boot of the car to the @entity62 the @entity63 : the spot where the assassin is believed to have been when the president was shot in 1963 like millions of others , she was lost for words on november 22 , 1963 , when @entity8 was shot			2
but as the day progressed and @entity11 was arrested , her day took a strange turn			2
' my @entity70 , ' she remembers saying , ' i know that boy '			0
he was motivated , she claims , by @entity74 ideologies , and provoked by mental problems , a broken marriage , and a peculiar sense of ' fate ' as @entity8 's car drove past his shop			1
and she says with no doubt that he acted alone			0
' he knew there was something wrong with himself , but he had these other things , delusions that he was something bigger than he was			0
' he even told me in defecting to the @entity49 that he " wanted to give the people of the @entity1 something to think about "			2
' unexpected friendship : @entity93 ( left ) and @entity7 ( right ) became friends as ms @entity7 wrote her book about @entity15 's assassination			1
they are pictured with friend @entity97 widow : @entity98 , @entity11 's @entity12 wife , here in 1977 , had grown fearful as her husband plotted attacks she added that @entity11 clearly intended the trial to be a political show trial by attempting to secure @entity104 , the @entity105 's chief counsel , as his attorney			1
in the years that followed , @entity7 embarked on a journey to uncover the background			2
she made friends with @entity98 , @entity11 's @entity12 widow , who was living in @entity111 by that point			1
the couple had met and married in the @entity49 years before and had two children , before moving back to @entity1			2
having already suffered mentally for years , his marriage struggled as he obsessively plotted to shoot people opposing the communist movement			0
he would want to know why he died , he 'd want to know why this young man had nothing better to do than go out and shoot someone , much less go out and shoot him			0
- on her friend , @entity121 years after @entity8 's murder , detectives connected him with the attempted shooting of anti-communist army officer general @entity127 from his living room window in april 1963			1
at one point , @entity93 told @entity7 , he announced he was going out to find @entity130			2
she locked him in the bathroom and grew fearful he was becoming violent			0
in the months that followed , @entity93 left him , taking the children , and refused his pleas to reconsider			0
the night before the attack in @entity136 , he removed his wedding ring in an act that @entity7 believes was to protect @entity139			1
paying tribute to the eponymous president , @entity140 reflected on his character			0
she said : ' @entity8 was always asking questions , asking questions , he asked me many , many questions			2
legend : @entity15 , walking onto @entity149 in @entity136 on november 22 , 1963 , an hour before his death , is now an icon ' he would want to know why he died , he 'd want to know why this young man had nothing better to do than go out and shoot someone , much less go out and shoot him			0
' it is one of numerous memories expressed today to mark the anniversary of his death			0
flags are being flown at half - mast throughout the @entity1 today in what president @entity160 has declared a @entity162			1
last night , the @entity8 family both mourned and rejoiced , as they welcomed @entity15 's great - niece into the world			1
political : @entity11 would have wanted the trial to be a political show trial , ms @entity7 believes @entity169 , daughter of @entity170 and @entity171 , @entity15 's nephew , was born at 3.11pm on tuesday at @entity172			1
mr @entity8 , 47 , said that although it is a bittersweet week , this ' made it a whole lot sweeter '			0
he told @entity177 : ' i think this is so symbolic of the circle of life and how life keeps moving forward			0
' we can look back in time and think about what would have been had my uncles lived but we have to live for today and we have to live for the future and they would want us to do that and that 's why this marks such a special occasion			0
