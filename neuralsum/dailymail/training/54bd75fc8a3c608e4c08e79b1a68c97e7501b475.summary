by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 05:52 est , 10 october 2013 updated : 07:26 est , 10 october 2013 @entity2 today hit out at the @entity3 for publishing secret files which served ‘ no purpose ’ other than to aid terrorists who want to harm @entity6			1
the @entity9 leader joined the barrage of criticism that the newspaper released @entity6 ’s intelligence secrets of no interest to readers but highly - valued by fanatics and foreign spies			1
it follows @entity21 director - general @entity20 ’s warning this week that the leaks are a ‘ gift ’ to terrorists			1
security officials fear the data will be used by terrorists to avoid detection when plotting an atrocity			2
the @entity3 has argued its revelations have ‘ prompted a debate which was both necessary and overdue ’			1
but mr @entity2 rubbished the idea that highly - sensitive intelligence needed to be released in order to prompt discussions about the scale of the surveillance state			2
in an unusual attack on the left - wing newspaper , mr @entity2 said : ‘ i think it ’s a totally legitimate debate about the power of these technologies , about how you get the balance right , how do you make sure these technologies are used in a proportionate and accountable way			2
‘ but , i do n’t think just giving technical secrets , if i can put it that way , to people who want to do us harm serves any purpose			0
’ speaking on his weekly phone - in on @entity66 , he added : ‘ i ’ve got no doubt that there were some parts of what was published which will have passed most readers of the @entity3 completely by , because they were very technical , but would have been of immense interest to people who want to do us harm			1
' i certainly agree that if what you end up doing is just basically publishing very technical information , that actually most @entity3 readers , or most of us would n’t frankly understand , but the only people who will understand are the sort of technicians if you like amongst the terrorists , then what ’s the public interest in that ? ' fury : the spy chief : @entity21 director - general @entity20 has blasted the @entity3 's publication of @entity6 's espionage capabilities his comments came after mr @entity20 warned that the disclosure of the ‘ reach and limits ’ of the @entity97 's capabilities was a gift to terrorists			1
in a speech this week mr @entity20 said : ‘ it causes enormous damage to make public the reach and limits of @entity97 techniques			2
such information hands the advantage to the terrorists			2
' it is the gift they need to evade us and strike at will			2
unfashionable as it might seem , that is why we must keep secrets secret , and why not doing so causes such harm			0
’ @entity3 newspaper editor @entity116 was described as ' naive ' mr @entity20 dismissed suggestions that the agencies were trawling through people 's private lives for anything that looked interesting as ‘ utter nonsense ’			1
yesterday @entity123 backed mr @entity20			1
a no 10 spokesman – when asked whether mr @entity123 agreed with mr @entity20 ’s comments – said : ‘ the prime minister thinks it was an excellent speech and we are , as you would expect , always keeping under review the measures that are needed to contribute to keeping our country safe			1
i would happily point you to all parts of the director general ’s speech			0
’ mr @entity2 argued that secrecy was vital in order to keep the country safe			0
‘ we have legislation , and regulations , which were designed for an age which is quite different now , and both terrorists and @entity143 and security agencies , now conduct this battle , if you like , online in a way that was unimaginable just even a few years ago			0
‘ and , what that means for privacy and proportionality , i think that ’s a totally legitimate area for debate			0
‘ how you hold the secret parts of any @entity156 to account is an incredibly important issue , because secrecy is necessary , of course it is , you absolutely must defend the principle of secrecy from the intelligence agencies without which they ca n’t keep us safe			0
‘ but , you can only really make secrecy legitimate in the eyes of the public if there is proper form of accountability			0
’ @entity3 editor @entity116 denied putting lives at risk and – defying security officials – said he would continue publishing top secret information , which the paper has been splashing across its front pages since june			1
in an interview yesterday he said : ‘ we are working slowly and responsibly but as we discover further stories that we think merit the debate , the debate that everyone says is necessary , then we will go on publishing			0
’ the first @entity3 revelations came in early june , when it detailed how the @entity186 – which supplies intelligence to @entity97 , the organisation which gathers intelligence for @entity21 and @entity189 – had ‘ direct access ’ to the computer systems of @entity192 , @entity193 , @entity194 , @entity195 , @entity196 , @entity197 , @entity198 , @entity199 and @entity200			1
the newspaper also revealed how @entity97 has access to a network of cables carrying international phone calls and internet traffic and is processing vast amounts of ‘ personal information ’			0
by the time his identity as the source of the leaks emerged , @entity33 had fled his home in @entity213 for @entity214			0
after a week in hiding , he travelled to @entity215 , where he remains out of the reach of @entity34 authorities .			0

@entity9 leader said readers would have been baffled by the leaks
@entity21 chief @entity20 called paper 's expose a ' guide book ' for terrorists
he said the coverage is a gift to ' thousands ' of @entity6 - based *extremists*
@entity123 backed the criticism of the @entity3 's publication
