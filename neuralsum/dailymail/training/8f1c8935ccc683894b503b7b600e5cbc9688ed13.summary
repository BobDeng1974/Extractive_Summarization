by @entity0 published : 19:22 est , 31 january 2013 updated : 05:02 est , 1 february 2013 grilling : chairman @entity1 said the evidence given by accountancy bosses was ' shocking ' and ' laughable ' @entity5 's biggest accounting firms yesterday said they were ‘ proud ’ of making billions helping companies avoid @entity5 tax			1
in ‘ shocking ’ evidence to mps , bosses told how they regularly advised wealthy corporate clients to use offshore havens and legal loopholes to minimise @entity5 tax payments			1
they admitted to having more than 200 offices in tax havens such as the @entity17 or @entity18			1
one even confessed to selling policies which had a high chance of later being declared unlawful in court			1
helping companies avoid tax earned them more than £ 2billion a year , said the four firms – @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29			0
the testimony was condemned as ‘ shocking ’ and ‘ depressing ’ by mps on the public accounts committee			1
astonishingly , each of the executives in turn said they were ‘ proud ’ of their work			0
@entity37 , head of tax at @entity27 , said : ‘ we are giving the best advice we can to clients on the options which they have			2
‘ i do n’t see anything wrong with that			0
’ but committee chairman @entity1 said mr @entity37 ’s company ’s activity ‘ stinks ’			1
she said the taxman had little hope of competing in a ‘ @entity54 ’ battle against the accountancy giants paid millions to help companies avoid tax			0
mr @entity37 yesterday admitted selling policies which had a 75 per cent chance of being later declared unlawful			1
mrs @entity1 replied : ‘ i find that shocking			2
’ it also emerged that the companies all send senior tax partners to @entity61 or the @entity62 to help draft new legislation			0
when they return to their firms , the companies use the new - found knowledge of loopholes to devise new ways for corporations to avoid paying full dues to the taxman			0
mrs @entity1 said it was ‘ depressing ’ that such ‘ clever ’ people had chosen to work ‘ in an area which reduces the available resources for us to build schools , hospitals and transport infrastructure ’			2
she told the companies they should be barred from receiving government contracts worth millions if they deliberately advised their wealthy firms and individuals to cut the tax they pay to the @entity62			2
but the firms were unrepentant			0
@entity84 , head of tax at @entity29 , said : ‘ we help make the tax system work			0
’ another boss , @entity88 of @entity26 , insisted : ‘ our main purpose is to help our clients pay their tax ’ – a statement mrs @entity1 described as ‘ laughable ’			1
the four heads of tax were grilled for almost three hours in the @entity95 in the midst of huge public controversy over the low tax bills paid by multinationals such as @entity100 , @entity101 and @entity102			2
dismissed : @entity88 from @entity26 said her company 's job was to ' help clients pay tax ' - a claim @entity1 described as ' laughable ' in his speech to the @entity110 in @entity111 last week , prime minister @entity108 said there were ‘ some forms of avoidance that have become so aggressive that i think it is right to say these raise ethical issues ’			1
he warned he would use @entity5 ’s presidency of the @entity118 to press for action from the world ’s most powerful governments			0
but the firms denied their practices were ‘ aggressive ’ and were keen to distinguish between evasion – which is illegal and which they all said they would not engage in – and avoidance , which is taking advantage of incentives within the system .			0
