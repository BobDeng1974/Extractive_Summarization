it 's breaking ' bout time that the immensely popular @entity2 show added some @entity3 to its roster of awards and on sunday night , it did just that			2
the slow - burning cult classic bowed out in september with a critically acclaimed finale that was also a resounding hit with the show 's diehead fans			2
it saw @entity13 's meth - cooking antihero @entity14 enjoy a redemption of sorts just before he died and involved a typically mesmeric performance from the 57 - year - old			2
sadly , his partner - in - crime , the incandescent @entity36 , 34 , lost out in the supporting actor to category to @entity40 for @entity41 , but he got the chance to yell his catchphrase when the show bagged the @entity46 honour			1
' yeah , b * * * * ! , ' @entity36 yelled after the ensemble cast took to the stage to accept their award with show creator , @entity51			2
@entity52 gets his moment : @entity36 got to yell @entity55 's ' yeah b * * * * ! ' when the cast accepted the award for @entity46 recognition : @entity51 finally got the recognition he deserves with this award the winning team : @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity51 , @entity64 and @entity36 celebrate their achievement hey there , @entity68 ! @entity62 played @entity14 's machiavellian wife in the show and she never got to wear dresses like this @entity13 took to the stage to thank @entity51 , who was a writer on the cult @entity74 , who helmed the show throughout its five seasons			2
' he 's a genius , ' he told the audience before shouting out to @entity36 : ' i love you , man ... you 're a great actor ! ' he also thanked the @entity35 and revealed he hoped a win at the @entity3 would help international audiences find the show			2
and it might not be the last time we 've seen @entity36 's excitable but pure - hearted @entity55 , or strangely , @entity61 's @entity14			2
at last : @entity13 accepted @entity88 for his incredible portrayal of @entity14 in @entity2 's sleeper hit transformation : @entity13 's performance as the meek chemistry teacher who becomes a drug kingpin was as breathtaking as @entity36 's was heartfelt slow burner : the show finished after its fifth season in october and was by that point a huge hit for the network in the february issue of details , @entity36 reveals he and co-star @entity13 want to make cameos in the upcoming spin - off , @entity105			1
with production on the spin - off scheduled to start later this year , the actor , whose character was last seen driving off into the sunset in the series finale , is eager to get back into those meth covered shoes			0
' both @entity13 and i want to be a part of that , if they 'll have us			0
' television favourites : @entity64 , @entity13 , @entity62 , @entity63 and @entity51 posed together with the awards mr and mrs : @entity13 and @entity62 enjoyed a moment at the @entity2 afterparty sparring partners : @entity126 , who played psychopathic @entity127 in @entity21 , was pleased to see @entity36 - who killed him in the series finale his lucky night : series creator @entity51 gets a kiss from @entity62 and @entity63 , as @entity13 looks on but the @entity131 winner does admit when the series was winding down he could n't resist giving input and sent a letter to producers with suggestions of how he thought his character should die in the finale			1
' i just felt like i would always regret it if i did n't at least throw them a pitch on how i wanted @entity52 to go out			0
so i gave a few different ideas of how i thought he would kill himself			0
i did n't want anybody else taking his life			0
' while he says ' the letter was awful , ' producers , thankfully , did n't take the advice and spared @entity52 's life in the end			0
the gang 's all here : @entity64 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity51 and @entity155 pose with their statues ' i wish that i was @entity158 ! ' @entity36 , with wife @entity159 in the background , got the party started as usual exciting times : @entity155 , who played @entity164 's kleptomaniac purple loving sister - in - law thew herself into the celebrations interestingly , @entity52 was supposed to be killed off in the first season but quickly became a fan favourite			0
@entity36 was nominated for five @entity131 for playing @entity52 and won two during @entity21 's five year run			0
back in september , the series finale attracted an all - time high of 10.3 million viewers			0

this is great news for @entity36 who says he never interferes with what the writers and producers of the show do			0
' i never give my two cents when it comes to @entity21 , because why would i ? ' he says			0
' i 'm just the actor , and what they 're doing is perfect , you know ? ' @entity182 , 31 , was probably similarly respectful on the set of her latest drama , the @entity208 's @entity183 , which is written by @entity210 auteur @entity209			1

visibly shaken , the star - best known for her portrayal of @entity240 in @entity2 's @entity241 , accidentally swore as she accepted her award			0
