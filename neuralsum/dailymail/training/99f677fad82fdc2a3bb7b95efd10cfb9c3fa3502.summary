by @entity0 with its legions of ice zombies , fearsome dragons and powerful warlocks , it can sometimes seem as if @entity6 is a little farfetched			1
however , dig below the surface and you will find it is largely based on historical events , as author @entity11 has admitted himself			1
for example , the @entity12 which separates the kingdom of the @entity14 from the wild lands beyond is based on @entity17 ; the @entity18 , who first separated @entity20 into seven kingdoms , are a reference to the @entity23 , who separated @entity25 into seven kingdoms			1
the war between the @entity28 and the @entity29 also bears stark similarities to the @entity31 between the @entity25 houses of @entity33 and @entity34 between 1455 and 1487			1
like the @entity28 , the @entity34 were northerners , like the @entity29 the @entity33 were southerners and extremely wealthy			1
but the parallels do n't end there , some of the @entity40 bear a striking resemblance to historical figures as well			1
@entity43 : @entity44 @entity46 's own descent into debauchery may have been inspired by that of @entity49 ( right ) in his younger days , @entity50 was a fearsome warrior , tough enough to lead a rebellion , overthrow thousands of years of @entity53 rule and establish a new rule with himself as @entity55			1
not unlike a young @entity49 who brought the @entity34 line to the throne in 1461 , but later descended into drunkenness and lewd behaviour , much like @entity46 , his fictional counterpart			1
@entity49 , like @entity46 , also changed his will on his deathbed , naming a regent as his successor and causing a succession crisis			2
@entity49 died after an accident while fishing , while @entity46 died after being skewered by a boar			2
the lusty @entity46 , a fan of both wine and hunting , also bear more than a few similarities with @entity71 , who was also a fierce warrior who later developed a penchant for a feast or two			2
@entity74 is a low - born man who worked his way into the court of @entity50 keeping one hand firmly on the purse strings , as did @entity79 with the court of king @entity71 if @entity46 bears similarities with @entity71 , then it fits that @entity74 , his master of coin in @entity6 , should make an historical parallel with @entity79 , who played a central role in @entity71 's court			1
like @entity79 , @entity74 is not a high - born man			2
he worked his way into the @entity55 's service using guile , skill , and by keeping a firm grip on the kingdom 's purse strings			1
@entity79 started life as the son of a brewer , and was a soldier for a time , but later trained as a lawyer and gained skills in accountancy before working himself into the @entity55 's court			1
however he was a scheming man who betrayed one of his staunchest allies in @entity105 which ultimately saw her executed			2
baelish himself is also a ruthless schemer , had a hand in betraying @entity109 to his death , and may have helped the @entity28 on the way to an early grave as well			2
write caption here in a world of traitors and deviants , @entity114 stands for all that is good , just and fair			1
he was a fearsome warrior , a masterful ruler , and an honorable man , though it eventually betrayed him to his death			2
much like @entity122 , @entity123			0
he fought in the @entity124 in @entity125 , and for his success was rewarded with various offices of state , proving an efficient and capable ruler through all of them			0
like @entity114 after @entity46 's death , @entity122 also became protector of the @entity133 during @entity135 's madness			1
however , he had bitter disagreements with @entity71 's wife , @entity137 , as @entity138 did with @entity139			1
@entity122 eventually tried to seize the throne but was unsuccessful , mirroring the moment @entity138 attempts to seize the throne from @entity109			0
ultimately both @entity122 and @entity138 were killed by beheading , and ended up with their heads mounted on spikes			0
both @entity139 and @entity137 were known as schemers who put their own desires before the common good @entity135 's wife , @entity151 , was known for being a controlling an scheming woman who often put her own desires above the greater good			1
she also had disagreements with @entity122 , @entity123 , and ultimately saw his head put on a spike			0
much like @entity158 , who spent most of her time before @entity46 died disagreeing with @entity114 - before his head was put on a spike - and most of her time after his death plotting and scheming to get her illegitimate son @entity109 on the @entity163 and secure her place there			1
at the @entity166 , she shows she is not averse to putting her own desires ahead of the common good , ordering the spare food from the feat to be thrown to the dogs , rather than being given to the city 's poor , as rival @entity172 ordered			1
@entity174 and @entity175 both raised armies overseas			0
later @entity71 used his to seize the @entity25 throne			0
we can only hop that at some point @entity174 gets around to doing the same @entity175 , later @entity175 , took the throne from @entity122 after crossing the channel with a foreign army in tow , marching through his birthplace and recruiting more troops along the way			0
for many years before that , however , he lived a life of exile in @entity125 while chaos slowly spread in @entity25 , waiting for the perfect moment to seize his opportunity			0
not a little unlike @entity174 , who has been slowly amassing a huge army across the @entity194 ( read : the @entity195 ) while plotting to invade her birthplace , rallying the loyal to her cause as she goes			0
loyal to his @entity55 , but unfaithful to his nephew heirs , @entity122 mirrors @entity201			0
but while @entity122 eventually seized the throne , @entity201 has so far fallen short @entity201 , brother of @entity50 , was unfaltering in his loyalty to the @entity55 while he was alive , but after @entity46 's death , declared his own nephews illegitimate and tried to seize the throne for himself using some fairly controversial tactics			1
@entity122 , brother of @entity49 , was also loyal up until the point of the @entity55 's death , upon which he declared his own nephews illegitimate , and succeeded to the throne after their ' disappearance '			1
both @entity213 and @entity49 betrayed a promise of marriage , leading formerly close allies to rebel while @entity49 's descent into drinking a lasciviousness may have inspired @entity50 's drinking and infidelity , @entity49 's marriage was undoubtedly what inspired @entity213 's own tumultuous love - life			2
@entity49 rushed into an impulsive marriage which alienated one of his key allies , the @entity228 , who had arranged for the king to marry the sister - in - law of the @entity125 monarch , @entity233 the @entity234 , @entity235 , later rebelled against @entity49 as @entity236 rebelled against @entity213 , leading to his gruesome death at the @entity238			0
@entity236 , as we know , betrayed @entity213 because the @entity240 went back on his vow to marry one of @entity236 's daughters			2
both @entity244 and @entity11 were separated from their parents at a young age following an unsuccessful rebellion			0
@entity11 also betrayed his brother to appease his father - in - law , while @entity244 betrayed @entity213 - who he thought of as a brother - to appease his father @entity252 @entity254 â€™s story mirrors that of @entity256 , @entity257 , who betrayed his brother , @entity49 , to align with his father - in - law , @entity235			0
in the tv series , @entity244 betrays @entity213 , who he was raised to think off as a brother , to gain the admiration of his natural father @entity252			0
both were also separated from their natural parents at a young age , although @entity11 's father was killed at the @entity268 , while @entity244 was simply sent to live with the @entity28			2
@entity109 was a ruthless ruler who was cruel to his betrothed , @entity270			0
@entity271 was also known for his cruelty , especially to his wife , but was never ruled as he was killed on the battlefield aged 17 known for an almost unmatched cruelty , @entity109 was one of the last people on @entity277 you would want to have any semblance of power , let alone rule a kingdom			0
as was the case with @entity283 , who is generally portrayed as a sadistic , bloodthirsty boy who was cruel to his wife , @entity285 , aka @entity285			0
as the son of @entity137 , the historical counterpart of @entity139 , who is @entity109 's mother in the series , he was also heir apparent to the @entity25 throne			1
luckily for the @entity25 , he died aged 17 on the field of battle			0
unfortunately for the @entity291 , @entity109 did n't .			0
