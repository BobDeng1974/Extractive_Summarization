the overweight should be prescribed @entity1 on the @entity2 , according to the health watchdog			1
gps will be told to offer the 12 - week slimming courses – which typically cost £ 100 – to patients			1
with the @entity8 having the second highest rates of obesity in @entity11 , the plan is likely to cost hundreds of millions of pounds			1
weight watchers : gps will be told to offer the 12 - week courses which typically cost £ 100 to patients and the @entity16 and @entity17 is advising doctors to consider referring patients who are only ‘ overweight ’ as well as those who are ‘ obese ’			1
around a quarter of adults in the @entity8 are classed as obese and a further 40 per cent are overweight			1
but experts say that even if patients lose only a small amount of weight , it could save the @entity2 money by drastically cutting their risk of developing diabetes , heart disease and some cancers			2
the @entity2 currently spends an estimated £ 5.1billion a year treating obesity - related illnesses			1
the new guidelines from @entity34 urge @entity13 to raise the issue of weight loss in a ‘ respectful ’ and ‘ non-judgmental ’ way			0
they say that courses such as @entity1 and @entity39 are a cost - effective way of combating soaring obesity rates , and claim that even if patients lose less than a stone , it will save money by reducing the number who go on to develop serious illnesses			1
and although gps have been told to prioritise those with long - term health conditions such as type 2 diabetes , high blood pressure or heart disease , the guidelines say family doctors should also consider referring patients who are just overweight as well as obese			2
as well as an estimated £ 5.1billion a year treating obesity - related illnesses , the @entity2 also spends £ 10billion a year dealing with the complications of type 2 diabetes			1
the @entity2 already pays for obese patients to go to slimming classes and spends an estimated £ 800,000 a year on @entity1 alone			1
but the new guidance is likely to lead to many more being referred			0
figures show patients attending @entity1 and similar sessions manage to lose only 3 per cent of their body weight			0
@entity34 says even this small amount will benefit health			0
nutritionist @entity70 , who helped draw up the @entity34 guidance , said : ‘ losing as little as 3 per cent … will have benefits in the long term as long as that weight is kept off for several years			0
’ but campaigners questioned how the @entity2 would be able to pay for all the courses and raised doubts over their effectiveness in the long - term			2
obesity expert dr @entity80 said : ‘ the vast majority of existing weight - loss companies do n’t offer significant support to achieve behavioural change , nor do they have evidence of long - term results			0
’ and @entity88 of the @entity89 said : ‘ the @entity2 is in such a parlous position that it will not be able to fund all the programmes needed			2
’ @entity34 says that if someone with a body mass index of 35 lost 5 per cent of their weight , they would typically add two to four years to their life			0
this is equivalent to a woman who is 5ft 6in and 13 stone losing just over two stone			0
and the benefits are even greater for more obese patients – someone with a @entity105 of 40 who lost 5 per cent of weight could live between eight and ten years longer			0
not all obese patients will be automatically referred , as it will depend on funds available .			0
