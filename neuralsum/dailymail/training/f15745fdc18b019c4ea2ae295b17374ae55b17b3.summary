the 62 - year - old @entity6 frontman looked exhausted – frankly as though he was in urgent need of a cup of cocoa and an early night – as he performed with his band to sell - out crowds at the weekend			1
not that his shiny snakeskin suit can have helped his bedraggled appearance – probably making him perspire even more			2
dishevelled : @entity3 looked exhausted during his performance at the @entity16 venue in @entity17 @entity3 previously described the bespoke suit as a personal favourite			1
he told an interviewer : ‘ [ the suit ] i can delightedly reveal cost just £ 350 to have made			2
‘ what else is a budget - conscious sex god rock star going to wear ? ’ fans of the not - so - gracefully aging star watched on in dismay as mr @entity3 danced in white shoes and a creased black shirt			0
the frail star shook his sweaty silver hair as he jerked his limbs around a microphone stand in front of the @entity37 new wave band			0
the @entity6 , who had hits between 1977 and 1985 , reformed this year and performed in @entity17 as part of a comeback tour			2
worth the cash ? @entity3 revealed one of the benefits of the tour is helping out his less affluent bandmates sweaty shuffle : @entity3 looked bedraggled in his shiny snakeskin suit - a bargain at £ 350 , apparently speaking about the reunion tour which was prompted following a performance at the @entity53 festival this year , mr @entity3 said : ‘ it will be good money-wise for a couple of the guys who have n’t done as well as myself			1

the @entity6 frontman was *onstage* in @entity17 for a comeback tour
