president @entity1 jets off to @entity2 in the wee hours of saturday morning , in the hope of making progress on climate change negotiations and national security talks with prime minister @entity7			1
the visit is largely ceremonial , though , timed to coincide with @entity10 festivities , which mark the day in 1950 when the country 's @entity11 took effect			1
but global warming is on the agenda , along with other issues including @entity2 's intensifying disputes with @entity18			2
the president will not visit @entity18 , unlike on his previous visit			0
he and the first lady plan to be back in @entity22 early on wednesday so he can partcipate in a farewell ceremony for outgoing secretary of defense @entity24			0
@entity27 's military draw - down in @entity28 and ongoing nuclear negotiations with @entity30 will also be on the menu in @entity2			2
' from the time the president took office , he 's made increasing @entity27 engagement with @entity2 a top foreign policy priority , @entity1 's deputy national security adviser for strategic communications @entity38 told reporters on thursday			1
but the world 's two largest democracies have seen deep tensions in recent years			2
@entity2 artist @entity43 gives final touches on a painting of @entity27 president @entity1 in @entity47 , @entity2 , friday , jan. 23 , 2015 so the @entity48 was caught off guard when @entity7 invited @entity1 to be the first @entity27 president to attend the @entity10 events			1
@entity1 will be the first @entity27 president to visit @entity2 twice while in office			1
' it took us by some surprise , ' said @entity38			0
' there 's a great affinity between the @entity27 and @entity2 and our people , but there 's also a history that is complicated and that would have made it seem highly unlikely that a @entity27 president would be sitting with @entity2 's leaders at their @entity10 ceremony			1
' after some internal deliberations , the @entity48 accepted @entity7 's offer			0
the president and first lady @entity68 arrive in @entity70 early sunday , local time , for a three - day visit that includes a fresh round of bilateral meetings , an economic summit with @entity27 and @entity2 business leaders and a visit to the famed @entity78			1
the city of @entity80 , where the monument is located , has mobilized 600 people to clean streets , round up stray dogs and clear cows from the streets			1
authorities have ordered a lockdown around the complex			0
' there are a lot of spit stains and such that need to be washed away			0
the streets need to be spick and span , ' said @entity2 's former chief archaeologist @entity96 , who has guided world leaders around the white marbled mausoleum			1
' you can not have a @entity100 of the world come to the @entity78 and let him see that , ' @entity96 told the @entity104 news agency			0
the president 's visit is expected to be heavy on symbolism and lighter on substantive advances			0
@entity2 political commentator @entity109 said expectations for concrete deliverables during the visit are ' below the standards usually set by @entity27 presidents when they travel across the world for a three - day visit			1
' still , @entity27 and @entity2 officials appear to agree that even a symbolic show of solidarity between the leaders would be a sign of progress after recent difficulties			0
while military cooperation and @entity27 defense sales have grown , @entity22 has been frustrated by @entity2 's failure to open up to more foreign investment and to address complaints alleging intellectual property violations			1
in sept. 2014 , @entity1 met with @entity2 prime minister @entity7 in the @entity131 of the @entity48			0
. @entity1 arrives in @entity70 on sunday and will be the first @entity27 president to attend @entity2 's annual @entity10 festivities @entity2 's liability legislation has also prevented @entity27 companies from capitalizing on a landmark civil nuclear agreement between the two countries in 2008			1
relations hit a new low in 2013 when @entity2 's deputy consul general , @entity139 , was arrested and strip - searched in @entity140 over allegations that she lied on visa forms to bring her maid to the @entity27 while paying the woman a pittance			1
the official 's treatment caused outrage in @entity70 , and @entity2 retaliated against @entity27 diplomats			2
for @entity7 , hosting @entity1 at the @entity10 parade caps off a year of high - profile diplomatic maneuvers by a leader who was once shunned by the international community and even denied a @entity27 visa in 2005 , three years after religious riots killed more than 1,000 @entity156 in the @entity2 state where he was the top elected official			1
the visit ties in neatly with @entity7 's election promise that he would turn around @entity161 's third - largest economy			0
and it could send a message to @entity18 and @entity164 – @entity2 's closest neighbors and rivals – that @entity7 has a powerful ally in the @entity27			2
' @entity7 has used the invitation as a way of signaling that the @entity27 really looms large in his calculations for where he want to take @entity2 , ' said @entity172 , a senior associate at the @entity22 - based @entity173			0
@entity27 officials say they hope the improving relationship between @entity1 and @entity7 will have payoffs in the policy arena			0
the @entity48 plans to push @entity2 on climate change , particularly after reaching a sweeping agreement with @entity164 on limiting carbon emissions			0
the president will also be accompanied on his trip by several @entity27 business leaders in hopes of forging new partnerships with @entity2			2
the centerpiece of @entity1 's visit will be monday 's celebrations , which are partly a @entity190 - style display of @entity2 's military hardware and partly a @entity194 's @entity193 - type parade with floats from across the country highlighting @entity2 's cultural diversity			1
the parade , once a huge attraction , has lost much of its sheen for @entity2 's elite over the past decade			2
but it continues to draw tens of thousands of visitors eager to view the spectacle at least once in their lifetimes			0
