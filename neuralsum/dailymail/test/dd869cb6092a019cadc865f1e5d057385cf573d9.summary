builders in @entity1 have accidentally found one of the largest and most complex underground cities in the otherworldly region of @entity5			1
the area is famous for its stunning rock formations , deep valleys and ancient subterranean hideouts , which have been carved from volcanic ash rock			2
the latest find is thought to be the biggest underground city in @entity5 , consisting of 3.5 miles ( 7km ) of tunnels , secret churches , tombs and safe havens			1
the city lies beneath the @entity21 fortress ( pictured )			2
three entrances to the impressive complex can be seen , leading to vast , winding tunnels the subterranean city dates back around 5,000 years and was discovered when builders saw signs of a massive network of tunnels while moving mounds of @entity31			1
it lies beneath the @entity21 fortress and the surrounding area , which was being excavated during a construction project carried out by @entity1 's @entity36 ( @entity37 )			2
the multilevel settlement is likely to include living spaces , kitchens , wineries , chapels , staircases , according to a report in @entity45			0
the find is similar to the discovery of another underground city , @entity49 , which was made in 1963 when a man took down the wall in his basement			1
a view of the underground city newly discovered in @entity1 's @entity56 province of @entity21 , which is famous for fairy chimney rock formations			1
the city was built from volcanic ash rock the latest find is thought to be the biggest underground city in @entity5 , consisting of 3.5 miles ( 7km ) of tunnels , secret churches , tombs and safe havens			1
scientists have yet to discover all its secret passages @entity5 , or ' @entity5 ' in @entity1 , translates as ' land of the beautiful horses ' and tourists often catch a glimpse of long - maned horses galloping through the formations			2
millions of years ago , volcanic activity covered the region under several layers of ash			2
@entity79 then created a landscape of rock formations and spires known as ' fairy chimneys			0
' the volcanic rock , or ' tuff , ' was soft and highly malleable , and proved ideal building material			0
the idea for underground cities came during the @entity90 - era when residents used them as hideouts when threatened by invasion by the @entity95 , @entity96 and @entity97			0
the latest find is similar to the discovery of another underground city , @entity49 , which was made in 1963 when a man took down the wall in his basement			1
@entity49 was once home to 20,000 residents living together underground , in a city eleven levels deep with 600 entrances			1

it had areas for sleeping , stables , wells , kitchens , ventilation shafts , tombs , communal rooms , bathrooms			0
like @entity49 , the latest underground city was built to protect residents from invaders , but remains largely unexplored			1
but this city is far larger , with early estimates suggesting it could be around a third bigger than @entity49			0
geophysicists from @entity126 recently conducted a systematic study of a 1.5 mile ( 4 km ) area using geophysical resistivity and seismic tomography			1
the studies suggest the underground corridors may go as deep as 371ft ( 113 metres ) , but the exact size remains unknown			1

' this new discovery will be added as a new pearl , a new diamond , a new gold ' to @entity5 's riches , @entity185 , mayor of @entity21 , told @entity45			2
he says he wants to build ' the world 's largest antique park , ' with boutique hotels and art galleries aboveground , and walking trails and a museum below			0

underground city was discovered in otherworldly region of @entity5
it is *believed* to consist of at least 3.5 miles ( 7km ) of tunnels and rooms
geophysicists studied a 1.5 mile ( 4 km ) area using seismic tomography
study suggests underground corridors may be 371ft ( 113 metres ) deep
