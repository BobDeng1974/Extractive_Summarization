her sacrifice of a salary pays her family back in ways mrs @entity7 believes are priceless , and she is not alone			2
a new breed of young , educated , and married mothers are finding themselves untouched by the notion of ' having it all			1
' for the first time since the downturn of 2008 , the percentage of stay - at - home mothers rose between 2010 and 2011 - and some of the biggest increases have been among younger mothers , aged 25 to 35			1
mrs @entity7 is now able to be present for her children no matter what - cooking healthy meals , helping patiently with homework , and most importantly , devoting herself to teaching them life lessons , from manners to good habits , that she believes every child should know			2
@entity62 , left her job as a wealth adviser three years ago after her third child was born , and she has no plans to go back to work			2
rather than a a sacrifice , she feels it is a privilege to oversee ' not just what they do , but what they believe , how they talk to other children , what kind of story we read together			0
that ’s all dictated by me			0
not by my nanny or my babysitter			0
' her husband , who also works in fiance , deposits his monthly paycheck in their joint account			0
' i ’m really grateful that my husband and i have fallen into traditional gender roles without conflict , ' mrs @entity62 said			0

and he ’s very happy that he goes to work			0
' meanwhile @entity103 coo and mother - of - two , @entity105 , in her new book , @entity106 , argues that a generation of tougher , stronger and more strategic women are needed to equalize @entity110 workplaces			1
but mrs @entity7 and mrs @entity111 are among those who view managing their children 's lives , and their household , as their highest achievement			1
they believe they are better equip for the job than their husbands , and are blissfully happy in their decision			0
' some days i just have to pinch myself , ' mrs @entity7 said			0
' it ’s so easy , it ’s so rewarding to live this way			0

" ' one woman on the @entity154 message boards recently wrote : ' i was blessed with the patience to truly enjoy being home with my kids and know that in the end family is what is important in life - not pushing papers at some crap job			1
' @entity165 sociologist @entity164 , author of @entity166 : @entity167 in a @entity168 of @entity169 , work and @entity170 , noted in 2010 that a quarter of women would still choose a traditional domestic arrangement over the independence that comes with a career , despite all she said more mothers believe ' that only a parent can provide an acceptable level of care ' and that ' they are the only parent available for the job			1
' mrs @entity7 explained : ' i feel like in today ’s society , women who do n’t work are bucking the convention we were raised with ... why ca n’t we just be girls ? why do we have to be boys and girls at the same time ? ' @entity191 , editor - in - chief of @entity192 , a network of 3,000 blogs for and by women , added : ' what these women feel is that the trade - offs now between working and not working are becoming more and more unsustainable			1
' the conversation we hear over and over again is this : " the sense of calm and control that we feel over our lives is so much better than what is currently on offer in our culture			0
" and they ’re not wrong			0
' in her much - discussed @entity211 piece , why women still ca n't have it all , @entity214 called for better workplace programs : more parental leave , more part - time and flextime options			1
but even she admits this new breed of women could be on to something			1
' are there characteristics inherent in sex differences that make women more nurturing and men more assertive ? ' she asks in @entity106			1
' as they mature , women earn less than men and are granted fewer responsibilities at work			2
since @entity233 published @entity234 fifty years ago , women still earn 77 cents to the male dollar , representing just a small portion of corporate and government leaders			2
despite bowing out of this fight for gender equality in the workforce , mrs @entity7 said she is convinced she made the right decision			0
' i know this investment in my family will be paid back when the time is right , ' she said , referring the option of someday , when her children start college , figuring out what she will peruse next			2
' you have to live in the now			0
i will deal with later when later comes			0
i ’ll find a way			0
who knows ? maybe i will be home for ever and ever			2
maybe i will have the best - kept lawn on the block for the rest of my life			2

a new breed of women are turning their backs on @entity103 coo @entity105 's new book , @entity106
she wants tougher , stronger and more strategic women working full - time to equalize @entity110 workplaces
but stay - home mothers say managing and raising their family is their highest achievement
