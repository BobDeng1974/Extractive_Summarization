ms @entity1 , who spent only one night in the house before the accident , says paint used on the steps made them slippery and there was no suitable handrail to stop her falling			1
lawyers representing mrs @entity17 , whose husband @entity34 had painted the steps leading up to the door of the @entity38 property , are contesting liability on her behalf			0
@entity40 for mrs @entity17 asked ms @entity1 : ‘ the real problem was that it was very , very wet and you were going up backwards ? ‘ you presumably were n’t looking where you were going ? ’ giving evidence in court , ms @entity1 , now of @entity46 , @entity47 , said she had moved to @entity23 from @entity50 the night before she fell			1

proceedings : at the @entity21 ( pictured ) ms @entity1 's barrister @entity61 called an unguarded drop of eight ft on one side of the steps was ' unreasonable ' her barrister , @entity61 , said : ‘ we say that , by putting smooth paint on steps that were naturally rough in texture and were exposed to the elements , the defendant was responsible for creating a risk and unreasonably and negligently so			1
‘ it was a risk that was manifestly foreseeable			0
‘ what is more , it must be considered in relation to the potential severity of the consequences of that risk , that is , the virtually unguarded drop of eight feet to one side of the steps			2
‘ we say there was an obvious risk associated with steps anyway , these steps in particular , whether the paint made them smoother or more slippery or not			0
‘ it is unreasonable in the circumstances where there is a drop of over eight feet to one side not to erect some sort of guard or handrail against that risk			0
‘ the steps were outside			0
they ’re liable to become dirty , as well as wet or frosty , and that adds to the level of risk that ought to be foreseen when , firstly , painting them so they become smoother and , in any event , when considering what might happen to someone using the steps			0
