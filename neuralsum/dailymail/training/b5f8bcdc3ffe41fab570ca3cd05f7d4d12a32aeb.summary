@entity2 's 50pm income tax rate cost @entity3 £ 6.9billion in lost revenue from its wealthiest individuals , figures revealed last night			1
while some 16,000 workers declared an income in excess of £ 1million in the 2009/10 tax year to @entity10 , that number dropped to just 6,000 after then prime minister @entity11 brought in the new tax rules			1
tax paid by the top earners fell from £ 13.4billion before the top tax rate came in to £ 6.5billion in 2010/11			1
cut top rate : @entity17 ( right ) claimed new figures showed that 8,000 people earning more than £ 1m this year would gain £ 107,000 each as a result of @entity22 's ( left ) budget decision to cut top rate to 45p for $ 150,000 earners it is thought that many of the highest earners moved abroad or reduced their taxable incomes to avoid paying the new levy			1
many are said to have avoided paying the new rate either by bringing forward payments or delaying them , by moving earnings abroad or by choosing to work less			0
many now appear to be returning to the @entity3 , with the number of £ 1million plus earners rising again to 10,000 since chancellor @entity22 announced that the top tax rate would be reduced to 45p from next april as part of the @entity37 earlier this year			1
but while conservatives used the figures to claim that @entity2 's decision to increase the highest rate of tax actually lost government revenue , @entity17 highlighted separate figures to accuse ministers of handing @entity3 ’s rich a tax break worth more than £ 100,000 yesterday			1
the number of people declaring incomes of more than £ 1 million slumped from 16,000 to 6,000 mr @entity17 claimed that new figures showed that 8,000 people earning more than £ 1 million this year would gain an average £ 107,000 each as a result of @entity22 ’s budget decision to cut the top rate to 45p for those earning more than £ 150,000			1
@entity55 mp @entity54 hit out at @entity2 's 50p top tax rate claiming that it has cost the country billions of pounds			1
but who is she ? elected at the 2010 general election following the retirement of @entity62 , @entity54 was managing director and @entity63 at the @entity65 office of investment bank @entity66			0
she left the company in 2008 with more than 20 years service at the bank under her belt			0
the 52 - year - old mother - of - three has been on the @entity72 since 2010 and was a member of @entity75 's so - called ' @entity74 ' aimed at increasing the number of ethnic minority and female conservative mps particularly in safe seats			2
she made headlines in november last year after saying that jobless families should be banned from claiming benefits for more than four children			0
@entity2 had previously said that earners on more than £ 1 million stood to gain £ 40,000 a year as from the chancellor ’s decision addressing workers at a sheet metal factory in @entity89 ahead of next week ’s autumn statement on the economy , mr @entity17 said they were paying the price for the government ’s decision to stand up for the ' wrong people '			1
‘ @entity75 and @entity22 believe the only way to persuade millionaires to make work harder is to give them more money			0
but they also seem to believe that the only way to make you work harder is to take money away , ’ he said			0
‘ cut your tax credits , squeeze your living standards , get rid of some of the services on which you rely , and put up vat			0
that ’s where the money is coming from for the millionaires ’ tax cut			0
’ mr @entity17 faced embarrassment earlier this year after wrongly claiming that all millionaires would receive a £ 40,000 tax cut			2
in fact the tax cut relates to earnings , not wealth - and critics pointed out that the @entity2 leader has assets worth well over £ 1 million			2
@entity124 sources hit back strongly at mr @entity17 ’s latest claim , suggesting that the introduction of the 50p rate was an ‘ ideological move ’ , which had cost the country billions of pounds			0
@entity124 mp @entity54 , who uncovered the figures suggesting that the 50p tax rate had seen the number of those claiming to earn more than £ 1million drop , said : ‘ @entity2 ’s ideological tax hike led to a tax cull of millionaires			1
far from raising funds , it actually cost the @entity3 £ 7 billion in lost tax revenue			2
‘ we have taken tough action to clamp down on tax avoidance and make sure those with the broadest shoulders bear the biggest burden			2
' that ’s why in every single year of this government the rich will pay a greater share of our nation ’s tax revenues than in any one of the 13 years that @entity2 were in office			1
’ ' behavioural response ' : @entity10 found that tax rate prompted thousands of wealthy individuals to take action to avoid the new rate , either by bringing forward payments or delaying them , by moving earnings abroad or by choosing to work less an @entity10 report into the tax concluded there was ‘ a considerable behavioural response to the rate change , including a substantial amount of forestalling ( deferring income to avoid the tax )			2
’ mr @entity22 insisted on slashing the 50p rate , arguing that it made @entity3 uncompetitive and deterred entrepreneurs from coming to the @entity3			0
he had wanted to scrap the top rate entirely for anyone earning more than £ 150,000 a year , but that move was blocked by the @entity175			0
many @entity176 believe the cut will lead to higher tax receipts in future , arguing that the wealthy will have less incentive to avoid the lower rate			0
the @entity175 also blocked his plan to reduce the top tax rate to its previous level of 40p , claiming that it would send out the wrong signal at a time when the less well off were being asked to contribute more to paying off the deficit			0
@entity2 will hold a @entity190 debate today to criticise the reduction of the top rate with senior coalition figures thrashing out next week 's @entity194 which sets out @entity149 tax policy for next year			1
an earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that two thirds of @entity3 ’s top earners ‘ deserted the @entity3 ’ after 50p top tax rate was introduced			1
we are happy to clarify that millionaires leaving the @entity3 was a minor factor in the fall in tax revenue from the group but a large proportion was lost from people forestalling payments .			0

the number of people declaring incomes of more than £ 1m slumped from 16,000 to 6,000 after @entity11 introduced the new tax rules in 2010
the amount of tax paid by top earners fell from £ 13.4billion to £ 6.5billion as a result
*toptories* describe the tax hike as ' ideological ' and claimed that the rich will now pay a greater share of the tax burden under the coalition
