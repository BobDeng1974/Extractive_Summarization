@entity0 has addressed @entity2 's defensive frailties this season by signing @entity5 defender @entity4 for an initial fee of £ 11.2million			1
the @entity8 centre - back had helped @entity5 towards the second best defensive record in @entity10 and will be a welcome addition at the @entity12 where the @entity14 ' backline has been depleted by injuries this term			1
the 24 - year - old has already been granted a @entity19 work permit and is expected to complete his move on monday , but who is @entity22 and is he the answer to @entity2 's defensive woes ? @entity4 ( left ) is expected to complete his move from @entity5 to the @entity12 on monday @entity14 fans will hope @entity22 can shore up a defence that has been depleted by injuries this season @entity0 has identified @entity22 as his main transfer target in the january transfer window @entity2 ’s new signing @entity32 or @entity22 ? @entity32 to @entity5 fans			1
and that ’s likely to be his footballing name in @entity36 too			0
how long has he been in @entity38 ? he signed for @entity5 in the summer of 2013 from @entity8 side @entity39			1
@entity5 were debating between signing @entity41 central defender @entity40 and 22 - year - old @entity32 and they opted for the boy from @entity8			1
@entity22 has starred for @entity5 this season but will need time to adapt to the pace of the @entity46 @entity22 embraces @entity5 captain @entity47 after being presented with a farewell gift and they chose well ? he was a reliable reserve at first but injuries to first choice centre - backs @entity52 and @entity53 gave him his chance and he took it			1
this season he had been near ever - present and a consistent performer in the team with the second best defensive record in the division			1
it ’s fair to say , however , that the jump from @entity62 to the @entity46 will be even more testing than the one from @entity8 to @entity10			1
where might he be found wanting ? he ’s less than two years out of @entity8 and still a little raw			2
@entity0 is buying huge potential but not the finished article			2
learning your trade in @entity8 and then playing in @entity10 might also not serve as the greatest apprenticeship for the @entity46 where many of the teams he faces will be far more direct than he has been used to			2
but he is 6ft 1in and competent in the air and it ’s also true that he bring a lot of other strengths to the table			0
@entity0 will be pleased that the 24 - year - old has an impressive fitness record and they are ? he will give the team excellent distribution out of defence			1
displays confidence and maturity on the ball			0
he is also quick , strong and aggressive			0
and , perhaps of extra importance to @entity2 in view of their record – @entity32 ’s fitness record is very good – barely missed a game since arriving from @entity8			1
and he ’ll be missed at @entity91 ? they have reasonable back - up in @entity52 and @entity53 and will buy before the window shuts but yes @entity32 had emerged as the best of the three central defenders at the club this season			2
they are used to seeing their best players leave and @entity103 ’s arrival softens the blow but coach @entity105 admitted it was ‘ inopportune ’			0
@entity4 was brought to tears as he said his final goodbyes to fans at @entity91 from his tears it looks as if @entity32 will miss @entity5 he was very settled on @entity62 ’s east coast			2
the move was also something of a surprise			0
but we ’ve seen goodbye tears from @entity117 before joining @entity118 and a watery eye from @entity120 when he left @entity121 to join @entity122			0
@entity32 will settle quickly ; he knows this is his big chance			0
and he ’ll have a friend at the @entity12 before a ball is kicked			0
@entity126 knows all about swapping @entity5 for the @entity46 albeit in his case via @entity128 .			0

@entity2 are on the verge of signing @entity5 defender @entity4
@entity8 centre - back has helped the @entity134 to the second best defensive record in @entity10
@entity0 's defence has been *hampered* by injuries to the likes of @entity140 and @entity141 this season
