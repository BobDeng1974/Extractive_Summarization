@entity71 won with an armbar submission at 2:33 of the first round			1
@entity71 ( right ) grapples with @entity75 on his way to victory in the first round @entity71 needed less than five minutes to earn victory and also wants a middleweight title shot @entity71 , who lost to @entity82 in his @entity83 days , hoped he could earn a shot at @entity30 's title with a fight against @entity88 silver medalist @entity87			1
but when @entity87 was injured , @entity75 stepped in on short notice - and a shorter fight			1
@entity71 won his eighth straight @entity4 fight and hoped a month ago a win would mean his name would get called next for a middleweight title fight			1
@entity95 and @entity96 would have been a @entity98 showcase of the best of the @entity4 middleweight contenders			0
