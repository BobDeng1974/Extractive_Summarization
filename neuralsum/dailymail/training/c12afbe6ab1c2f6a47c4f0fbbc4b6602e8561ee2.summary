the bureau has been battling what its assistant chief branded a ' rash of sexting ' that has spread through its offices , and has vowed to stamp it out			1
' when you are given an @entity27 , it 's for official use			2
it 's not to text the woman in another office who you found attractive or to send a picture of yourself in a state of undress			1
that is not why we provide you an @entity27 , ' @entity12 assistant director @entity36 told @entity40 this week			1
