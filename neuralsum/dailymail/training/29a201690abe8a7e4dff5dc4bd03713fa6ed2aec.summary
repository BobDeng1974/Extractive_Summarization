by @entity0 and @entity1 child rapists , kidnappers and perverts caught with child abuse images have been allowed to walk free by the police - because they said they were sorry			0
hundreds of sex offenders have been let off the hook because they apologised to their victims and the police for their actions , according to figures obtained by @entity13			1
the use of community resolution orders or restorative justice has allowed 256,816 crimes to pass without offenders going to court in the last three - and - a - half years			1
the orders were brought in to allow youths and first - time offenders to avoid a criminal record and get their lives back on track			1
but there is growing concern that they are now being used for ' the most perverse and sickening crimes '			0
shocking figures from 38 of @entity54 and @entity56 ' police forces show resolution orders were used in 30 rape cases , including 21 involving children			1
20 orders were handed out to people suspected of raping children aged less than 13 ( pic posed by model ) another community resolution order was given to a care worker in the @entity67 who caused a mental patient to engage in a penetrative sex act			1
five other orders involved kidnap or abduction , 75 were for sexually assaulting young children , and 284 sexual assaults were passed off with an apology			1
conservative mp @entity76 , who sits on the @entity78 justice committee , said he would be calling on the government to review the orders			1
he said : ' it 's shocking that offenders who admit to serious criminal offences are being offered the chance to say sorry and walk away from answering in a court of law for their crimes			2
' ' the community resolution order was designed for very low - level offences , not for some of the most perverse and sickening crimes			1
' i know that victims are meant to give their consent to these orders before they can be implemented but this would be at a time when they may be under the most distressing of circumstances			1
' frankly this is not good enough and just saying " sorry " should not even be on option			0
' i would expect the government to review these orders and establish why they have been used for suspected sex crimes			1
i expect the government to stamp down on this and ask : " how on earth has this happened ? "			0
' thousands of suspects of violent crimes also evaded proper justice , as did scores of cases of theft and criminal damage			0
at least two cases of bomb hoaxers were let off with an apology			2
community resolution orders were introduced so victims could be involved in the justice process			1
the orders are often used when shoplifters are caught in the act , or to punish youths so they do not get a criminal record			2
an apology has to be accepted by the victim , and the person who receives the order may have to do some form of community service			1
conservative mp @entity76 has called for a @entity104 review of community resolution orders the figures provided by 38 police forces in @entity54 and @entity56 relate to community resolution orders and restorative justice , both of which involve the victim of the crime accepting an apology			1
@entity142 , assistant chief executive for the charity @entity143 said : ' community resolutions are not for serious crimes such as rape or child abuse ; they are only supposed to be used for minor offences			2
' the priority for victims and witnesses is not only that justice is seen to be done , but that it is seen to work			2
victims want to know they will get justice and that a criminal will not commit the same crime again			2
' victims should be put first and their view must be taken into account before a community remedy is used – and only after it has been properly explained to them			1
they often lack confidence in the practicality , robustness and delivery of community sentences			2
' @entity167 resolution should never be used to simply cut corners or save money – else victims may feel like the offender has got away with it			1
' the @entity173 said it was up to @entity174 to make sure community resolution orders are used in the right circumstances			1
a spokesman said : ' we always expect criminals to be prosecuted and punished in accordance with the law			2
' serious crimes will continue to be progressed through the courts , where they will be met with tough sentences			0
in particular , conviction rates for violence against women and girls are at their highest - ever levels and sentences for rapists are longer			0
' however , community resolutions can be used for some crimes where the victim does not want the police to take more formal action			0
they are also often used in cases of young offenders to help them face up to the impact of their behaviour			0
' @entity204 are responsible for making sure they are only used in appropriate circumstances			0
' a spokeswoman for the @entity208 said : ' community resolutions are in the main used to deal with less serious cases , however , at times it may be necessary and appropriate to use them to deal with more serious cases			0
' the guidance is very clear that community resolutions should only be used if the offender accepts responsibility , the resolution reflects the views and wishes of the victim and there is no history of previous offending			2
' @entity167 resolutions can be used when the victim does not want to take more formal action and they are also often used in cases of young offenders where criminalisation is not seen as a proportionate response in the best interests of the victim and the offender			0
' last month @entity232 's shadow home secretary @entity231 condemned the use of the community resolutions in domestic violence cases			0
data from 15 police forces showed that 3,305 of the resolutions were used last year – up from 1,337 in 2009			0
she said in a speech : ' community resolutions can be very effective for things like anti-social behaviour			0
but they should n't be used for violent offences , and especially not for domestic violence			0
that is why @entity232 is committed to banning their use for domestic and sexual violence			0
