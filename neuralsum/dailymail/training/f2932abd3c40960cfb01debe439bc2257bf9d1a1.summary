the @entity1 mayor of @entity2 has announced plans to ban smoking in city parks as part of a plan to cut down on tobacco - related illnesses			1
in a muddled announcement on national tv on sunday , @entity9 said the move would be an experiment aimed at ‘ teaching people about cigarette addiction ’			1
this is despite the recent history of @entity19 ’s capital being associated with famous @entity20 puffing away in world - famous parks such as the @entity23 and @entity24			1
@entity2 mayor @entity9 said the move was an experiment to teach people about cigarette addiction @entity2 parks and gardens like @entity24 , above , and the @entity23 , are world - famous smoking spots aware of the massive opposition that there will be to the move in a country where some 30 per cent of the country still smoke , ms @entity9 insisted that her ‘ experiment ’ would not be strictly enforced			1
‘ we are not into banning , we are experimenting , ’ said ms @entity9 , who said parks in the unfashionable 14th arrondissement would act as ‘ guinea pigs in this experiment ’			1
but the move follows a new @entity1 directive which allows bosses to ban wine in the work place – leading to accusations that the very heart of @entity52 culture is under attack			0
traditionally liberal @entity20 are renowned the world over for sitting outside smoking and drinking as they discuss the arts and philosophy			0
under the plan @entity20 and tourists , like @entity60 visitors @entity58 , left , @entity61 and @entity62 , wo n't be able to enjoy cigarettes in city parks smoking is already technically banned in cafes , restaurants , stations and museums in @entity2 smoking is now technically banned in all inside public places in @entity19 , including cafes , restaurants , stations and museums			1
but terraces and other places outdoors are not included in the ban , because the chances of smokers harming those sitting around them are considered miniscule			0
smoking is also on course to be banned in public parks and other council - controlled outdoor areas in @entity88 , under radical plans to make the country ‘ smoke free ’ by 2034			1
tobacco - related illnesses are a leading cause of death in @entity19 , with an estimated 73,000 deaths annually			1
despite massive taxes on cigarette sales , health warnings , and every more stringent bans , there are still some 16 million smokers in @entity19			2
@entity19 is ‘ paralysed ’ and desperately needs reforms aimed at revitalising its crumbling economy , claims the country ’s @entity1 prime minister			2
@entity106 spoke out during the first day of a vital business summit aimed at creating half - a - million jobs and cutting public spending in return for lower taxes			0
the country ’s unemployment rate has soared above the 3.3 million mark as entrepreneurs leave because of failing @entity1 policies , including a top tax rate of 75 per cent			0
mr @entity106 said reforms were desperately needed because @entity19 was ‘ paralysed ’ by fear of ‘ blockages ’			2
he said @entity1 president @entity121 is determined to implement reforms , despite opposition from his own party			0
on sunday night , mr @entity106 told @entity124 in @entity125 : ‘ without reforms , we are threatened by the stalemate , stalled and thus in decline			0
to not move forward is to start losing			0
