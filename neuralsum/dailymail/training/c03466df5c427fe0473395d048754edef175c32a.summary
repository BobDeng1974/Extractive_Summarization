first home buyer activity has hit a new low with recent research showing august recorded the lowest levels in 15 years			1
there were 6,054 first home buyers committed to housing finance over the month , according to @entity8 research which used housing finance data from the @entity10			1
this is the lowest month reading since june 2000 , outside of the seasonally low months of january and february			1
the dramatic decline since then was caused by rising property prices , particularly in @entity14 and @entity15 , and the changes made to the availability of @entity19 grants			2
he says that the broad slowdown in first home buyer demand can probably be attributed to a few factors			2
' with dwelling values rising at a time when average wages are n't rising anywhere near the same pace , affordability constraints are dampening first home buyer demand , ' he said			1
' this is particularly the case in @entity14 and @entity15 where dwelling values have risen substantially			0
' mr @entity41 adds that @entity57 has had a huge impact on the market over the years			0
he says the grant boost of $ 14,000 in 2009 increased the number of active first timers in the housing market , reaching a record high of 18,744 in may			0
' when the " boost " to the @entity67 was scaled back in october 2009 and then removed in january 2010 we saw first home buyer numbers virtually fall off a cliff , ' mr @entity41 said			2
this trend has followed suit over the years with changes to either stamp duty concessions or eligibility to first home buyer grants			2
a director of the research says affordability constraints are dampening first home buyer demand and changes to the availability of @entity19 grants also caused the record low mr @entity41 says more first time buyers are purchasing investment properties , which does n't include them in the @entity10 first home buyer figures			1
@entity87 data research director @entity41 ' where a first home buyer is n't eligible for a grant or concession they may simply be flying under the radar and not being counted , ' mr @entity41 said			1
' for many first home buyers , the areas where they would like to live are simply too expensive for them to buy into , so they purchase an investment property while renting in an area closer to where they work and play			0
' the states and territories showing the most severe first home buyer trends are @entity103 , @entity104 , @entity105 and the @entity106			0
while stronger first home buyer trends and conditions were recorded in @entity109 , @entity110 and @entity111			0
however that trend has remained stagnant since mid- 2013 in @entity109 and @entity110 but has remained quite active in @entity111 , mr @entity41 says is reportedly the most affordable state for housing .			0
