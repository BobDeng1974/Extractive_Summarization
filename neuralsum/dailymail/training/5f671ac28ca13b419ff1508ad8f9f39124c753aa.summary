@entity0 is fighting to save his @entity2 career with @entity3 actively seeking a new no 1			1
@entity0 infuriated his manager on @entity6 by smoking a cigarette in the showers after the 2 - 0 defeat by @entity10 at @entity11 's			1
the @entity12 will be fined heavily by the club for this serious breach of discipline , but it is the goalkeeper 's performances on the pitch that are causing @entity3 greater concerns			2
@entity0 will receive a heavy fine after smoking a cigarette in the showers at @entity10 @entity0 goes walkies as @entity10 's @entity24 ( not in shot ) scores past him @entity0 is again beaten as @entity27 scores @entity10 's second goal on @entity6 born : april 18 , 1990 ( age 24 ) youth career 2004 – 2005 : @entity31 2005 – 2006 : @entity32 2006 – 2009 : @entity2 senior career 2009 – now : @entity2 ( 132 apps ) 2009 – 2010 : @entity35 ( loan ) ( 28 ) national team 2007 – 2010 : @entity38 ( 4 ) 2009 – 2012 : @entity39 ( 7 ) 2009 – now : @entity40 ( 22 ) @entity0 's decision to spark up following the clash against @entity44 's side is even more bewildering given his performance that day			1
to say he was already on @entity3 's bad side is an understatement			2
he was , arguably , at fault for both @entity10 goals			0
so , what possessed the goalkeeper to smoke in the dressing room after such an inept performance ? there 's a time and a place			0
this was n't it , particularly given @entity3 's disdain for smoking			2
this is not , however , the first time @entity0 has irked @entity2 's management team with his attitude			1
cast your minds back to 8.22pm on february 19 last year			0
@entity0 had just been sent off in the @entity67 last - 16 first - leg clash against @entity69 , leaving his team - mates to play the remaining 53 minutes with 10 men against the reigning @entity73 champions			2
you 'd have thought @entity0 would show some degree of regret to his colleagues that night			0
ask those behind the scenes at the @entity79 that evening and you 'll hear a very different story — one that still rankles with certain members of the first - team group			1
perhaps @entity0 finds it difficult to accept when he 's had a bad day at the office			2
smoking is a sure - fire way of leaving your troubles behind			0
@entity2 boss @entity3 is losing patience with @entity90 goalkeeper @entity0 @entity0 's team - mates were said to be unhappy at the @entity90 goalkeeper 's seflie at @entity94 those who know @entity0 will tell you he has an unshakable belief that he is destined to become one the best goalkeepers in the world			1
some would call it self - confidence			0
others would call it cockiness and arrogance			0
certain members of @entity2 's first - team squad would plump for the latter descriptions			1
his demeanour at the club 's @entity110 often rubs his team - mates up the wrong way			0
some players — even members of the backroom team — find him hard to stomach			0
@entity3 , his staff and some senior first - teamers were not impressed when @entity0 took a selfie with @entity121 and @entity122 on the @entity94 pitch following their victory against @entity125 in march			1
his attitude and professionalism is being questioned again after his latest faux - pas			0
no matter what they say publicly , managers will always make allowances for those who are indispensible to their plans			0
it seems @entity0 has used up his allowance			0
@entity2 scouts have been instructed to identify goalkeeping targets ahead of the summer transfer window , a clear sign that @entity3 has run out of patience with the @entity40 international			2
it now looks certain that a new shot - stopper — in addition to @entity10 midfielder @entity144 — will be a summer priority for @entity3			1
@entity146 would certainly be on @entity3 's radar , so too would @entity148			1
whether @entity149 or @entity125 would entertain selling to their local rivals is another matter			0
@entity3 would be keen on signing @entity146 or @entity148 if @entity149 and @entity125 were prepared to sell @entity144 is also likely to be on @entity3 's summer transfer wishlist @entity0 may still be able to turn it around — he 's done it before			1
having lost his place to @entity157 towards the end of the 2012 - 13 season , @entity0 eventually reclaimed his position as the club 's first - choice keeper			2
and he looked the part for large parts of last season , justifying @entity3 's decision not to sign the new no 1 that looked a certainty in the summer of 2013			0
but those lapses of concentration that have dogged @entity0 's career are re-surfacing			0
@entity172 replaced @entity0 in last sunday 's 2 - 0 @entity174 third round win over @entity175 , and @entity3 now has a big decision to make ahead of sunday 's visit of @entity178			1
does he stick with @entity179 or twist with @entity180 ? @entity3 's decision will provide a huge clue as to whether @entity0 's @entity2 career has gone up in smoke			1
meanwhile , @entity2 are confident they can complete the signing of @entity0 's countryman @entity185 this month			1
the @entity186 are hot on the heels of the talented 17 - year - old midfielder and expect a deal to be completed , despite having an initial offer rejected			0
@entity172 started @entity2 's @entity174 victory against @entity175 on sunday			1

@entity0 will receive a heavy fine for smoking in showers
the @entity2 goalkeeper *lit* up cigarette after 2 - 0 defeat at @entity10
@entity0 has infuriated members of @entity2 's first - team squad
@entity3 would be keen on signing @entity146 or @entity148
