by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 the most open and fascinating @entity3 selection in years will see three potential debutants named in the squad for next week ’s first test against @entity7 as the new panel herald widespread changes			1
@entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 are all set to feature when national selector @entity13 reveals his hand , with the probability of a return for a fast bowler seemingly long since jettisoned in @entity19			1
an experienced spine of @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 , who looks set to edge out @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26 will be joined by an eclectic mix of new and old faces charged with bringing the good times back			0
impressive : @entity10 ( left ) has starred for @entity3 in the @entity30 against @entity7 accumulator : @entity32 - born batsman @entity12 is tipped to open for @entity3 with @entity21 the acrimonious end to tuesday ’s decisive one - day international means there will be plenty of spice when the sides meet again at @entity38 but the central figure in the ‘ @entity41 ’ drama in @entity24 looks set to miss out			1
@entity3 performed an about - turn on their belief that @entity24 was not yet ready for @entity44 when the dust settled on his world - class one - day century at @entity38 but they will prefer prior as long as there is no reaction to his chronic achilles problem from his first four - day match of the season with the gloves			1
yet there will be plenty of interest in the new faces , with @entity10 sure to feature after his impressive one - day displays , @entity11 likely to get the nod as a spinning all - rounder and @entity12 the choice as @entity21 ’s opening partner			2
the only concern about the @entity32 - born @entity12 , who is averaging 51 for @entity64 this season after five centuries for the @entity66 last winter , is that he is an accumulator and may make for a one - paced partnership with the captain			2
taking his chance : @entity11 is set to be called up as a spinning all - rounder sacked batsman @entity76 jokingly made himself available for the first test , tweeting : ‘ @entity3 selectors meeting today ... i ’m ready to go ! @entity72 next week ... i ’m a number 4 batter & bowl off spin			1
# @entity75 ’ yet it is a concern that the selectors had appeared to have ignored on wednesday night when they spurned the option of restoring @entity81 to the opening berth he vacated during the ill - fated winter and making room in the middle order for a highly - talented but controversial figure in @entity86			0
there is no disputing @entity86 ’s ability , which he has again showed by scoring 682 runs for @entity90 in the @entity91 so far this season , more than any other batsman , but his failure to reach the required levels of physical fitness have held him back			0
@entity86 was left out on fitness grounds as recently as the @entity98 in @entity99 but that was under different management and it will be intriguing to see moving forward whether the elevation of his county coach in @entity106 to the selection panel will change his fortunes now			0
on wednesday it seemed that @entity86 had missed out but he remains very much on @entity3 ’s radar			0
@entity19 made the last of his nine @entity44 appearances seven years ago but he has finally , at 29 , fulfilled the potential that @entity112 saw in him and has been bowling rapidly to considerable effect for @entity114 this season			0
the fast show : @entity19 has been bowling at 90mph for @entity114 this season and is set for an @entity3 recall seven years after his last test , against @entity119 in 2007 ( right ) on a great run : @entity90 all - rounder @entity86 ( front ) is the leading scorer in @entity122 this season @entity21 ( captain ) , @entity12 , @entity22 , @entity81 , @entity124 , @entity11 , prior ( keeper ) , @entity126 , @entity25 , @entity127 , @entity26 , @entity19			1
@entity3 want fast pitches with bounce to take on both @entity7 and @entity130 this season and @entity19 looks the best bet to back up the certain selections in @entity26 , @entity25 and @entity10 as either 12th man at @entity38 or an alternative to @entity126 should the @entity137 all - rounder be deemed not quite fit enough yet			1
@entity124 , who has looked the part in international cricket without yet recording a big score , is the hot favourite for a middle order place ahead of @entity143 even though there are concerns about his ability against spin			2
@entity3 would love to find a way to get @entity143 into their @entity44 team , not least because of his leadership ability , and the @entity151 had the carrot of inclusion dangled in front of him when he was encouraged to abandon the @entity155			2
yet @entity143 has not yet put the first - class runs on the board that so many other challengers have and looked both short of form and out of sorts in the one - day series that ended in a 3 - 2 series defeat at @entity163			0
the backbone : captain @entity21 ( left ) and bowling talisman @entity26 may be joined by new faces			0

@entity3 national selector @entity13 set to go with old and new
@entity127 , @entity11 and @entity12 set for call to face @entity7 at @entity38
@entity19 could be back after fine start to season
@entity126 will be selected if fit following his hand *injury*
@entity124 set to beat @entity143 to middle - order spot
