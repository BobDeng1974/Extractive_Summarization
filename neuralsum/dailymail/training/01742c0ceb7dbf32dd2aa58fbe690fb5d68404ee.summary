@entity0 said she would ' baptize ' terrorists by waterboarding them at a @entity3 rally on saturday			1
@entity0 was a speaker at the group 's ' @entity4 , ' held at @entity6 in @entity7			1
the @entity13 former @entity12 governor and 2008 vice presidential nominee 's remarks followed her criticism of of policies she said were coddling to ' enemies that would annihilate @entity19 - they who 'd obviously have information on plots to say , carry out jihad			1
' oh , but you ca n't offend them , ca n't make them uncomfortable , not even a smidgen			2
her remarks were met with loud applause			2
as pointed out by @entity40 , @entity0 's remarks on saturday differ strongly from those of her 2008 running mate sen. @entity42 ( @entity43 ) , who was tortured as a prisoner of war in @entity45			1
' in my personal experience , the abuse of prisoners sometimes produces good intelligence , but often produces bad intelligence because under torture a person will say anything he thinks his captors want to hear – - whether it is true or false – - if he believes it will relieve his suffering , ' @entity42 said in 2011			2
too harsh ? elsewhere in her speech , @entity0 said that gun - free zones are ' stupid on steroids ' @entity0 also criticized an ' intellectual elite in a far - distant capital ' that she said wanted @entity19 to abandon @entity64 ideals			1
she also implied that the government is trying to control the people			0
' look , if you control oil , you control an economy , ' she said			0
' if you control money , you control commerce			0
but if you control arms , you control the people and that is what they 're trying			0
' elsewhere in her speech , she called the idea of gun - free zones as ' stupid on steroids ' and dismissed the idea of gun stores being linked to crime			0
' gun stores are an accomplice to crime - and that fork made me fat , ' she said .			0
