up to 320,000 homebuyers with interest - only mortgages risk losing their property because they are struggling to pay , the financial regulator warned yesterday			1
the figures , based on research by the @entity6 , reveal they have either missed or struggled to make a payment on loans which are specifically designed to be more affordable			0
the scale of the problem follows recent warnings of a ‘ ticking timebomb ’ of interest - only mortgages			1
big dipper : mortgage rates have plunged over the last five years but , if they were to rise suddenly , thousands of people on interest - only deals would struggle to keep up with their repayments of the 11.2million mortgages in @entity20 , around 35 per cent are interest - only , meaning that the homebuyer pays only the interest every month , but not a penny of the capital			1
in theory the mortgage - holder should save to pay off the capital at the end of the term , but nearly 80 per cent have no repayment strategy , according to the @entity6			2
they have been categorised as ‘ mortgage prisoners ’			0
others have been saving , but have been bitterly disappointed by how their investments , such as endowments , have performed			0
the regulator said between 5 and 8 per cent of these loans are ‘ in forbearance ’ , which means the homeowner has either missed a payment , or made the payment late			1
default : the tactic of putting people on interest - only mortgages has helped to keep repossessions low			1
they peaked at 48,300 in 2009 experts warn that homeowners have little chance of keeping a roof over their heads if they can not afford such mortgages with interest rates at a historic low			2
for more than three years the @entity56 has kept the base rate at 0.5 per cent			0
an interest - only mortgage offers a cheaper way to purchase a property than with a capital repayment mortgage , because borrowers are only paying off only the interest and not the capital			2
for example , a £ 150,000 homeloan at 5 per cent over 25 years would cost £ 625 per month interest - only , and £ 877 per month capital repayment			1
but at the end of the mortgage term , the interest - only loan will have paid off only the interest - leaving the original £ 150,000 debt to be repaid , whereas the repayment mortgage would have cleared the debt			2
@entity75 of financial consultants @entity74 said : ‘ we are creating zombie households that can only stay in their properties if interest rates are 0.5 per cent			1
’ despite the base rate being frozen , around one million homeowners will be hit next month by a jump in standard variable mortgages			0
the average increase is 0.62 percentage points , adding £ 53 per month to a typical £ 150,000 mortgage			0
before the credit crunch in 2007 , it was easy for a homeowner to take out an interest - only mortgage without providing any evidence of how the actual loan would be paid off			0
other research by the @entity6 , published in december , shows the extent of the problem as these loans come to the end of their life , but the borrowers have no money to pay them off			0
between 2011 and 2020 , it expects around 1.5million interest - only mortgages worth £ 120billion will be due for repayment			1
questioned by @entity107 recently , @entity106 , a director of the @entity6 , said : ‘ there is a ticking timebomb that has been created over the last 20 years			0
’ to make matters worse , it will soon become much more difficult for homeowners with an interest - only loan to remortgage			2
when new @entity6 rules come into force , probably in 2013 , it will be impossible to take out an interest - only mortgage unless you can prove you are saving to pay off the loan			1
a spokesman for the @entity120 said : ‘ banks are committed to treating customers sympathetically and will help where they can			0

35 *%* of 11.2million mortgages are interest - only deals
up to 8 per cent of these are ‘ in forbearance ’ , says @entity6
expert says low rates are creating ' zombie households '
