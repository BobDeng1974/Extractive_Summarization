by @entity0 published : 07:39 est , 9 june 2013 updated : 01:53 est , 10 june 2013 an astonishing confrontation on live tv between @entity3 and a shouting @entity5 conspiracy theorist saw the veteran broadcaster label him an ‘ idiot ’ and ‘ the worst person i 've ever interviewed ’			1
@entity5 radio host @entity9 was on @entity11 ’s @entity10 with journalist @entity12 to discuss the secretive @entity13 , which has been taking place over the past week			1
but mr @entity9 , 39 , launched into a noisy rant about the theories available on his website about the @entity5 government ‘ disappearing people ’ , which led to him eventually being cut off by mr @entity3 , 64			1
@entity12 ( @entity12 ) , thank you for being with us			2
it 's gone half past 11			0
you 're watching the @entity10			0
' the presenter then added : ‘ we have an idiot on the programme today ’ , before using hand gestures to indicate that mr @entity9 had lost his mind , as the @entity5 continued to shout at him off camera			1
mr @entity9 had said : ‘ hey listen , i 'm here to warn people , you keep telling me to shut up			1
this is n't a game			0
our government , the @entity5 , is building @entity39 ( @entity39 ) camps			1
‘ we have an @entity41 ( @entity41 ) where they disappear people now			0
you have this arrest for public safety , life in prison			0
it 's basically off with their heads , disappear them			0
astonished : veteran broadcaster @entity3 labelled mr @entity9 as ' the worst person i 've ever interviewed ' @entity11 show : @entity3 ( left ) was joined by @entity9 ( centre right ) and @entity12 ( far right ) ‘ take them away			1
you will not stop freedom			0
you will not stop the republic			0
‘ no , you guys are crazy , thinking that the public 's too stupid			0
you 're crazy , thinking the public does n't know			0
you 're crazy , thinking the public is n't waking up			0
’ ' you are the worst person i 've ever interviewed			1
we have an idiot on the programme today ' @entity3 mr @entity9 had already told the programme that the creation of the @entity69 was a ' @entity71 plan ' and said @entity13 is ' heavily involved in the @entity73 plan '			1
he added : ‘ we have forced them from cover to admit they ’re puppeteers above the major parties			0
mr @entity3 later said on @entity78 : ' the moment @entity9 knew he was no longer on air he stopped			1
' the shouting at the end of the show - which was criticised as ' all an act ' by mr @entity3 - was immediately labelled ' spectacular ' by the @entity86 's @entity85 and ' tv gold ' by the political blog @entity89			1
the @entity13 is an international group of politicians , business leaders and academics who meet behind closed doors - this year at a luxury country hotel near @entity23 , @entity95			2
@entity96 is another @entity97 broadcaster to have felt the roar of @entity9 in a live tv interview			2
mr @entity96 , 48 , brought the radio talk show host onto his @entity102 show in january to explain why he thought the journalist should be banned from the @entity5 for his views on gun control			1
the topic had been the focus of mr @entity96 's prime - time shows for a period following the december 14 massacre at @entity110 in @entity111 , @entity112			0
mr @entity9 , however , spent nearly all of the time screaming at mr @entity96 at the top of his lungs , calling him a ' redcoat foreigner ' and threatening revolution if anyone tried to ' take our guns			2
' mr @entity96 later wrote about the confrontation in the @entity86 , saying mr @entity9 was ' ranting and raving like a gorilla at the zoo who ’s just seen the morning bucket of bananas arrive '			2
today mr @entity96 said on @entity78 : ' morning , @ afneil - did n't you get my memo on @ @entity130 ? ' it 's happened before : broadcaster @entity96 was shouted at by @entity9 in a @entity102 interview in january			2
