a businessman jailed for fraud after being ' swallowed ' by his addiction to online gambling has written a repentant letter to his family revealing the double life he kept from them for 30 years			1
@entity8 , 58 , of @entity9 , @entity10 , was jailed for two years in april after swindling a @entity12 company out of more than £ 50,000 to repay private bank loans and secret gambling debts			1
his wife @entity15 and three children had no idea he was in trouble until his sentencing - and the father recently decided to come clean to them , telling them about the ' money bug ' that wrecked their family			1
happier times : @entity8 ( right ) is pictured with son @entity27 , ( left ) who was unaware that his father had a gambling problem and was thousands of pounds in debt until the day before his sentencing in a repentant letter from behind bars , the former chair of governors at a children 's school , who was paid £ 71,000 a year in his role for a healthcare supplies company , said he was ' stung by the power of money '			1
he said a love of money led to a mountain of debt which sparked his pursuit of a quick ' win '			1
@entity8 has appealed to anyone falling into a similar situation to seek help and support at the first sign of trouble			1
in the letter , he writes : ' this is my truth			2
i am a gambler , maybe a compulsive gambler			2
' i discovered money talked and those dreams on the horizon could be brought closer			2
the ' money bug ' was a disease idolised by all			2
' i became a keen follower			2
i did not have to look far to find a bank or organisation that would lend me money and it seemed this was the way one bettered oneself			2
warning : @entity70 , ( above ) who received a letter from his father from prison , has warned people about the dangers of online gambling and has started a campaign calling for tighter regulations on the industry ' i was swallowed down this tunnel to a point where i could only borrow money to finance the repayments of earlier borrowing , a self - perpetuating and self - defeating spiral of debt			1
' i never shared the state of my debt ridden life - not with my family , not even with myself			1
' this part of my life has an unknown beginning buried by me in my mind under lock and key			2
' along this journey of deceit i took to gambling - firstly as a way of making a quick win to kill this mountain of debt and then , as it failed to live up to those expectations , it became an escape with potential to cure my money ailments			1
' the atmosphere of my life was turning very sour and yet i still was not brave enough to openly admit the absolutely devastating money mess i was burying myself in			2
' but the atmosphere can be sourer , more putrid and in my dark side this was the natural course to take - fraud ! ' mr @entity8 said he gambled ' like it was an @entity116 sport '			1

' now , the @entity8 family face losing their home in @entity10 , @entity165 , and say their lives have been left in turmoil by the revelations			1
he added : ' now my family do not trust me and all my good points count for nothing			0
my friends have retreated and are ashamed even to call me an acquaintance			0
' my colleagues , my mp and most who know me have put a big distance between me and them			0
i would do the same if i was them			0
' my sentence extends to a family distraught , a family set to lose everything now			0
my friends ' views of me are tainted and i am damaged forever			0
' if anyone sees a little piece of themselves in my story may i offer them this advice - never lie			2
seek help and support at the first sign of trouble			0
' his son @entity27 , 21 , claimed after the sentencing that he ' was in absolute disbelief and disgust ' at his father 's actions			1
the young businessman has now launched a campaign calling for tighter regulations and control of the online gambling industry to protect those suffering from compulsive behaviours			1
he said : ' we will lose everything we 've got			0
our house is on the line , our life is in turmoil and my father is similarly suffering from psychological problems			0
' life will never be the same for us and my dad 's letter shows for the first time how dangerous compulsive behaviour can be , made ever worse by the availability of money and gambling in the modern world			1
' i hope my father 's story and honesty helps others to know this situation is not as rare as it sounds , help and support is available			0
do not be afraid to reach out and access it			0
' apologetic : the fraudster sent four pages of scrawling writing to his family , in which he came clean about the double life that he had kept from them for 30 years confession : in the heartfelt letter @entity8 writes ' i was swallowed down this tunnel to a point where i could only borrow money to finance the repayments '			1
