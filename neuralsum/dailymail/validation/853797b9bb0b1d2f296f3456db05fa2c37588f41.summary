the @entity1 's $ 10.9 billion annual budget is so puny that it 's ignoring 60 per cent of phone calls from people who are working on their tax return who have questions in advance of the april 15 filing deadline			1
@entity9 , the agency 's commissioner , said tuesday during a speech at the @entity12 in @entity13 that $ 346 million in budget cuts this year has caused a noticeable negative impact on taxpayer service			1
' ' this year we were forced to substantially reduce hiring of extra seasonal help we usually bring in during the filing season , ' @entity9 said			2
' as a result , the phone level of service is now below 40 per cent			0
' this truly is an abysmal level of service			0
' @entity9 was n't ceding new ground in @entity43 ' hate - hate relationship with the @entity1			1
he was arguing that @entity44 should give his agency more money			0
' we are aware of taxpayers lining up outside some of our offices many hours before they open , ' he said			0
' you would think , in fact , we must be selling something like the @entity56 watch when you look at the lines			0
this is not a new story this year ; it ’s just gotten worse			0
' overall , @entity9 complained , ' the @entity1 is now the lowest level of funding since 2008 , ' resulting in ' fewer audits and collection cases ' and costing the @entity64 at least $ 2 billion in revenue			1
@entity66 abolished : presidential canididate sen. @entity67 ( pictured in @entity68 on march 27 ) has campaigned on the idea of doing away with the @entity1 , but @entity9 said tuesday that it ca n't be done – although ' you can call it something other than the @entity1 if that makes you feel better ' @entity44 has weighed that number , though , against a much larger sum of money that has gone out the door to tax fraud scammers			1
in 2013 , the last year for which reliable numbers are available , the @entity1 paid out $ 5.8 billion in fake tax refunds to identity thieves			1
law enforcement crackdowns have taken ' a lot of the amateurs off the street , but we are clearly dealing with organized crime syndicates here and around the world , ' the commissioner said			0
and the @entity1 itself gets ' millions of attacks on our system every year , ' he griped , due to some software packages the @entity1 has been using since ' when @entity97 was president			0
' ' about the only good thing you can say about them , ' @entity9 joked , ' is that the code they use has been out of date for so long that it has the unintended effect of creating problems for any hackers who might try to figure out how the system actually works			2
' the @entity1 has been hammered in recent years after investigations revealed lavish spending on employee conferences for its employees , including one featuring am expensively produced @entity116 parody video			1
another bone of contention among lawmakers who set @entity9 's budget has been the practice , now discontinued , of paying performance bonuses to at least 1,100 agency employees who themselves owe delinquent taxes			2
the @entity1 , the federal government agency @entity43 most love to hate , has had its wings clipped by @entity44 following a series of spending scandals including lavish employee conferences and bonuses paid to tax cheats @entity133 @entity132 rep. @entity132 , who chairs the congressional appropriations subcommittee that oversees the @entity1 , warned the commissioner this year that the @entity137 nas taken note			1
' we deliberately lowered the @entity1 funding to a level that will make the @entity1 think twice about what you are doing and why you are doing it , ' @entity139 told him , because you do n’t have a single dime to spare on anything frivolous or foolhardy or even mediocre			0
' tax returns for individual filers are due in two weeks , but six - month extensions are available			0
still , most @entity43 find @entity43 's tax laws confusing enough to rely on tax - preparation software or professional preparers to help them navigate the waters , leading to frustration and now - legendary resentment			2
' the @entity1 code is longer than the @entity157 , ' @entity9 said tuesday , ' with none of the good news			1

@entity9 revealed the *startling* *statistic* during a speech at the @entity12
he says budget cuts have forced the @entity1 to pare back its staff numbers , leaving tax return filers largely on their own
@entity168 has already cried poor this year , complaining that it lacks the manpower to conduct as many audits as in past years
but the @entity1 paid out $ 5.8 billion in fake tax refunds to identity thieves in 2013 , the most recent year for which numbers are available
@entity43 have a hate - hate relationship with the agency : ' the @entity1 code is longer than the @entity157 , ' @entity9 admitted , ' with none of the good news '
