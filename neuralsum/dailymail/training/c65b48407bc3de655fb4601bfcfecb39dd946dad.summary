by @entity1 reporter published : 12:55 est , 12 may 2013 updated : 13:15 est , 12 may 2013 pope @entity2 today proclaimed hundreds of 15th - century martyrs beheaded for refusing to convert to @entity4 as saints of the @entity6 , as he led his first canonization ceremony in a packed @entity8			1
the ' @entity9 ' were 813 @entity10 who were slain in the southern @entity10 city in 1480 for defying demands to renounce @entity14 by @entity16 invaders who overran the citadel			0
their approval for sainthood was decided upon by @entity2 ' predecessor , @entity21 , in a decree read at the ceremony in february where the former pontiff announced his retirement			1
pope @entity2 delivers his speech during a canonization ceremony giving the @entity6 hundreds of new saints in @entity8 at the @entity29 ceremony : @entity2 , middle , kisses the altar as he arrives to celebrate his first canonization ceremony in @entity8 at the @entity29 today it is estimated around 60,000 @entity6 gathered in @entity8 during @entity2 ' canonization mass at the @entity29 the @entity29 seemed at pains not to allow the first canonisations of @entity2 ' two - month - old papacy to be interpreted as @entity39 , saying the deaths of the ' @entity41 ' must be understood in their historical context			1
shortly after his election in march , @entity2 called for more dialogue with @entity45 but it is unclear how the granting of sainthood to the martyrs will be received			1
the first pontiff from @entity51 also gave @entity52 its first saint - a nun who toiled as a teacher and spiritual guide to indigenous people in the 20th century			1
with @entity52 's president @entity59 among the @entity60 , the @entity58 pope held out @entity61 as a potential source of inspiration to the country 's peace process , attempted after decades - long conflict between rebels and government forces			1
@entity2 prayed that ' @entity52 's beloved children continue to work for peace and just development of the country '			1
nuns place relics of the new saints on the altar during a canonization ceremony led by @entity2 in @entity8 at the @entity29 a woman holding a poster of mother @entity80 who dedicated her life to working with poor people and became the country 's first saint after @entity2 canonized her in @entity85 today faithful @entity6 spray around a poster of mother @entity80 in her hometown of @entity88 , @entity52 , today as @entity2 canonizes her during a ceremony in @entity85 he also canonized another @entity91 woman			1
@entity92 , a @entity93 who dedicated herself to nursing the sick , helped @entity6 avoid persecution during a government crackdown on the faith in the 1920s			0
the ' @entity9 ' were 813 @entity10 who were slain in the southern @entity10 city in 1480 for defying demands to renounce @entity14 by @entity16 invaders who overran the citadel			0
they were killed during the year - long siege of @entity106 , on the southeastern @entity107 , by @entity108 who sacked the city , killed its archbishop and told the citizens to surrender and convert			0
when they refused , the @entity108 commanding officer ordered the execution of all men aged 15 or older , most by beheading			0
@entity6 sainthood requires that two miracles be attributed to those who are being made saints - one before beatification , and another before canonisation			2
in the case of the 813 @entity10 , the requirement for the first miracle was waived because they were killed ' in hatred of the faith '			0
the miracle approved for their canonisation was that of a nun who had cancer which , according to the @entity6 , was healed after she prayed at a memorial to the martyrs in @entity106			2
also known as @entity134 , she hid the @entity136 archbishop in an eye clinic for more than a year after fearful local @entity6 families refused to shelter him			0
@entity2 prayed that the new @entity93 saint 's intercession could help the nation ' eradicate all the violence and insecurity , ' an apparent reference to years of bloodshed and other crime largely linked to powerful drug trafficking clans			1
@entity2 told the crowd that the martyrs are a source of inspiration , especially for ' so many @entity152 , who , right in these times and in so many parts of the world , still suffer violence			2
' he prayed that they receive ' the courage of loyalty and to respond to evil with good			0
' the pope did n't single out any country			2
but @entity14 churches have been attacked in @entity164 and @entity165 , and @entity6 in @entity166 loyal to the @entity29 have been subject to harassment and sometimes jail over the last decades			2
christians in @entity170 must worship out of the public eye because the ultraconservative kingdom does not officially permit churches and @entity175 religious sites			0
@entity2 , the first pope from the @entity177 , which is known for its missionary zeal , praised the @entity52 saint for ' instilling hope ' in the indigenous people			1
he said she taught them in a way that ' respected their culture '			0
many @entity6 missionaries over the centuries have been criticized for demanding natives renounce local traditions the outsiders viewed as primitive			0
the pope also hailed the @entity93 saint for renouncing a comfortable life to work with the sick and poor , even kneeling on the bare floor of the hospital before the patients to serve them with ' tenderness and compassion '			2
pope @entity2 arrives at the altar in st peter 's square at the @entity29 for the @entity204 mass of @entity10 @entity205 and his companions , @entity52 @entity207 and @entity93 @entity92 pope @entity2 places a thurible at the altar in @entity210 at the @entity29 as he leads his first @entity204 mass @entity2 , in white , talks with cardinals at the end of a canonization mass in @entity8 today pope @entity2 waves to pilgrims in @entity8 at @entity29 today after canonising some 800 @entity10 martyrs who refused to convert to @entity4 in the 15th century mother @entity219 's example , said @entity2 , should encourage people not to ' get wrapped up in themselves , their own problems , their own ideas , their own interests , but to go out and meet those who need attention , comprehension , help ' and other assistance			1
after shaking hands with the prelates and @entity60 in the front rows at the end of the @entity232 , @entity2 shed his ceremonial vestments			2
wearing a plain white cassock , he climbed into an open white popemobile to ride up and down the security paths surrounding the crowd of more than 60,000			0
he stopped to pat children on the head , kiss babies and bantered in his native @entity241 with some at the edge of the crowd			0
@entity2 noted that the crowd included participants in an anti-abortion march of several thousand people , who walked a few kilometers ( miles ) from the @entity247 , crossing a bridge over the @entity249 to end near the @entity29 while @entity232 was being celebrated in @entity8			1
he drew attention to a signature - gathering drive in many @entity10 churches to push for a @entity254 initiative to ' guarantee legal protection for embryos , protecting every human being from the first instant of existence '			0
