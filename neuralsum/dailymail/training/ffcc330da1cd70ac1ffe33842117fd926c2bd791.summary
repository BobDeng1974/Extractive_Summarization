by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 18:45 est , 31 march 2013 updated : 18:46 est , 31 march 2013 a green tax that comes into effect today will drive tens of thousands of families into fuel poverty , experts warn			2
the ‘ carbon price floor ’ is designed to ensure suppliers use less gas , coal and oil – but has been described as a ‘ stealth poll tax ’ on individuals and businesses			1
analysts say the levy on the production of electricity from fossil fuels will account for an 8 per cent rise on household bills in just two years			1
the @entity22 think that households will pay more than 10 per cent of disposable income on heating and lighting it will raise billions for the @entity28 , but a report from the @entity22 found it is likely to hit economic growth			0
the @entity22 estimates that the tax will push up to 60,000 more households into fuel poverty – when more than 10 per cent of disposable income is spent on heating and lighting – this year alone			2
this will rise to 90,000 a year by 2020 , as the tax rises sharply in successive budgets			2
the think - tank predicts that wholesale electricity price will rise by around 17 per cent in three years due to the tax , which will equate to around an 8 per cent rise on energy bills			1
critics have said that the green tax is nothing but a way for the government , including the chancellor @entity48 , to raise money for the exchequer by contrast , subsidised companies selling electricity from wind farms and nuclear power stations will receive a £ 1.2billion boost over the next three years , as they benefit from the effect on the fossil fuel market			1
@entity59 , boss of @entity60 , said the carbon price floor is ‘ pretty close to a stealth poll tax ’			1
he added : ‘ it ’s not based on ability to pay , it ’s based on the requirement to keep warm and light your house			0
it was put in place with the stated objective of encouraging investment in low - carbon energy but it certainly does n’t achieve that objective			0
it ’s just a tax for the exchequer			0
’ the @entity22 ’s report notes that ‘ the environmental case [ for the tax ] is threadbare at best ’ , but adds it will raise £ 4.42billion for the government over three years – more than the bill for cutting corporation tax , or increasing the personal tax allowance			2
ministers claim that the public could actually save money by buying energy efficient appliances last year , the all - party energy and climate change select committee warned that the tax would place @entity91 companies at a disadvantage compared with international rivals			0
however , the @entity28 said : ‘ the carbon price floor is vital in reducing uncertainty and creating incentives for investment in low carbon electricity generation now so we have lower emissions in the future			1
’ last week , the government admitted that the cost of green taxes will more than double by 2020 to almost £ 300 a year			0
however , ministers claim that families will end up paying less based on assumptions that they will cut their energy use by more than a quarter , largely by buying efficient appliances , over the same period .			0

the ‘ carbon price floor ’ will ensure suppliers use less gas , coal and oil
production of electricity from fossil fuels will lead to an 8 *%* rise on bills
