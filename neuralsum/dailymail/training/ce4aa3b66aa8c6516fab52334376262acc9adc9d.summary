for the second time in months , @entity1 senator @entity0 found herself under fire for a campaign ad containing suspect footage			1
as @entity6 first reported on wednesday , @entity0 's latest tv ad contains fake footage of the three - term senator speaking at a hearing			1
' it is against @entity13 ethics rules to use footage that was shot using @entity13 cameras in campaign ads , so we reenacted it , ' @entity0 's campaign manager @entity10 told @entity19			1
@entity13 ethics rules prohibit members from using real footage ( right ) in campaign ads in the 60 - second tv ad released tuesday @entity0 's campaign also doctored a quote to make the @entity1 senator sound more articulate			1
' do you think there are a bunch of fairy godmothers out there that just wish a magic wand			0
' @entity0 said at the real hearing			1
in the fake hearing , @entity0 replaces the word ' wish ' with the word ' wave			1
' the ad also lists a fake news network named eye on @entity48 as the source of the video			0
the original hearing would have aired on @entity54 public broadcasting network @entity52			2
@entity0 's campaign did not respond to @entity56 's request for further comment			0
' we 're not sure that a @entity13 has ever done such a bizarre reenactment of a floor speech or committee hearing for a television ad , ' @entity59 communications director @entity58 said in a statement			1
@entity66 went on to say that @entity0 should ' appropriately label the footage as a dramatization or a reenactment			2
' @entity0 has released two campaign ads this year , including the spot running on television currently			2
both ads have drawn the ire of @entity75			0
in the first ad , @entity0 used real footage taken by @entity13 staff - a violation of @entity13 ethics rules that @entity75 jumped on immediately			1
@entity0 's campaign manager told @entity82 at the time that the error was made by a third party			2
' sen. @entity0 's official office was not involved in the production of this ad , ' @entity10 said			0
as a result of the first incident , @entity0 faked footage of a @entity13 hearing in the ad that dropped tuesday in order to avoid further ethics complaints			1
@entity54 sen. @entity0 walks with other female legislators towards a press conference on @entity98 april 1 , 2014 in @entity48 , @entity94 's @entity13 seat is up for reelection in november @entity0 's seat is a top target for republicans this election cycle			1
it is currently listed as a ' toss up by polling site @entity105 , meaning either @entity0 or a @entity75 could win the seat			2
because of @entity1 's complicated ' jungle primary ' electoral rules , all candidates vying for the state 's @entity13 seat will be listed on the ballot on november , 4 , 2014 , @entity114 in @entity54			0
if no candidate wins more than 50 percent of the vote , a run - off election will be held on december , 6			0
@entity118 rep. @entity118 is @entity0 's most formidable opponent			0
recent polling has neither @entity0 nor @entity118 winning the election out right			0
in a head - to - head match - up , @entity118 leads @entity0 by an average of 2.4 points .			0

this is the second time this year that @entity0 has found herself in the news over campaign ad footage
now , @entity75 are calling out @entity0 for using fake footage of her speaking at a @entity13 hearing
the campaign was unable to use real footage of the hearing because it is *banned* by @entity13 ethics , so it filmed a reenactment
in the reenactment @entity0 doctors a quote used in the original hearing to make herself sound more articulate
earlier this year the @entity75 of @entity1 filed a formal ethics complaint against @entity0 for using footage from a press conference taken by a @entity13 staffer
the @entity75 argued this was a *misuse* of *government* funds for campaign activity
