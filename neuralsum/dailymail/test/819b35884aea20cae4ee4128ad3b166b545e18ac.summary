‘ @entity3 ’ exclaimed a disgruntled @entity0 , at the very thought of anything to the contrary			2
‘ what you on about ? ’ alongside @entity7 , @entity6 also defended his honour			2
‘ he ’s been hugging everybody ’ , laughed @entity6			2
all of this because @entity10 teasingly suggested to @entity12 he was in ‘ hostile territory ’ as @entity14 brought us the lunchtime game from the @entity17 between @entity18 and @entity19			1
not since his aching knees took him away from the touchline have we seen @entity12 pitch side at a @entity24 ground			1
well , that break seemed to have done him the power of good as the former @entity28 gaffer chuckled at @entity10 ’s notion			1
‘ not easy ’ , he smiled			2
‘ but so far so good ’			2
@entity12 joined @entity14 presenter @entity10 for live broadcast of @entity18 vs @entity19 and it was indeed good to see @entity12 back in the role of pundit at a live game			1
his joints may be letting him down at the moment , but his wit and football nous seems to have remained undiminished as he joined in with the conversations that surrounded this crucial , and topical game			2
coming into the match , @entity42 had almost single - handedly managed to nearly shift the emphasis away from who would get the points to how many pounds he might get			2
and @entity12 had a view on both aspects			1
first he addressed @entity42 ’s contribution on the pitch , saying @entity19 had ‘ got away with it to a point ’ in playing him in recent games at wing back			1
but added that in this one ‘ he needs to play that free role ’			2
@entity12 was in fine form as pundit for saturday 's @entity24 encounter at the @entity17 while on the young player ’s future at the the club , for @entity12 there was only one position			1
‘ i think he needs to sign his contract			0
get on with his football			0
’ @entity0 and @entity6 were in totally agreement , stating in tandem ‘ he does ’ when asked if they thought he wanted to play his football at @entity19 ? when it came to a discussion on the title race , @entity12 was once again unswerving in his opinion			1
and you knew he was making a serious point because he was willing to back it with money against @entity0			0
‘ we ’ll have a tenner ’ , he suggested to the laughing former @entity18 hero			1
‘ i ’ll have @entity82			0
you ’ve got the @entity83			0
’ during the first half , a definite winner was commentator @entity86 who had one of those moments all the men behind the lip mics dream of			0
‘ interesting , before the match we saw @entity96 practise exactly this kind of free kick ’ , he told us as the @entity92 stood over the ball			0
the fact that just a few seconds later the same ball was now nestled in the back of @entity19 ’s net allowed @entity104 a well earned denouement			1
@entity7 and @entity6 were quick to defend former @entity28 boss @entity12 the presentation team were now in the studio at the break			1
@entity12 giving them knees a rest in the comfy chairs			1
and from where he was sitting he might just have been able to see the copy of his book placed strategically in shot just behind @entity10			0
so @entity12 was relaxed , but he was n’t resting on his laurels			1
when it became clear @entity120 was going to be coming on for the second half , @entity12 was quick to question @entity123 decision - making regarding the player			1
‘ what ’s he supposed to be , @entity127 ? turn it around ’ , was @entity126 reaction			0
and he added , ‘ if he ’s fit enough to come on now , why was n’t he fit enough to start the game ? ’ as we know , @entity120 had failed to wear his red underpants outside his shorts and the game was lost			0
leaving a disgruntled @entity123 to put a brave face on it in his post-match chat			0
at this moment , had there been anything hanging in the studio air regarding @entity12 ’s future in football management , he managed to snuff that thought out most effectively			1
@entity18 beat @entity19 4 - 1 in the @entity24 clash at the @entity17 on saturday picking up on @entity123 ’ pain straight away , @entity12 told us , shifting uncomfortably in that comfy chair , ‘ that ’s the most difficult thing , to stand there and smile			1
you ca n’t believe how low you go			0
it ’s scary at times			0
it ’s how it gets you ’ , he continued before reflecting , ‘ when it stops ( itals ) getting you like that , that is the time to pack it up			0
perhaps that ’s why i packed it up ! ’			0
that little punchline punctured the gloom and brought the house down			0
it was the perfect moment to put to rest any suggestion that @entity12 had departed from the game he clearly still loves			1
perhaps those old knees will stop him stalking the space in front of his team ’s dug out ? but it is unlikely to stop him from talking on the screens in front of us where i reckon he always was and clearly remains , great value			0
even at an even tenner .			0

@entity12 made his *pitchside* return at @entity18 vs @entity19
