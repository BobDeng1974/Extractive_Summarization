warning : more than 150,000 adults aged under 25 were diagnosed with chlamydia in 2010 alone @entity3 - the world 's most common sexual infection - is a more cunning and highly evolved bacterium than thought , scientists say			1
researchers analysed the entire genome of @entity10 and discovered that exchanges of @entity12 between different strains of the disease to form new versions are more common than believed			2
but current screening methods do not differentiate between the different strains , reports @entity18 , meaning the bacteria have the potential to become anti-biotic resistant without anyone realising			2
across the world there are around 100 million new cases of chlamydia each year , making it the most commons @entity28 in both the @entity29 and globally			1
researchers from the @entity31 found that if two strains of the disease infect the same host they are able to exchange dna and create an entirely new strain			2
this can happen even when the strains are in different parts of the body , they say			2
dr @entity40 explained : ' scientists recently discovered that if two @entity43 strains co-infect the same person at the same time , they can swap dna by a process called recombination			2
' this was originally thought only to affect a few ' hotspots ' within the genome			0
we were very surprised to find recombination is far more widespread than previously thought			0
' prof @entity52 of the @entity53 added : ' despite this being the most important sexually transmitted infection in the world , until now it 's clear that there are major gaps in our knowledge of the strains that are currently circulating , their evolution and natural history			0
' because current tests do not distinguish different strains , if a patient tests positive again after anti-biotic treatment it is not known whether the drugs have failed or they have picked up a second infection			1
this photo micrograph reveals what chlamydia looks like up close this means that if anti-biotic resistance did occur in the general population , it would not be detected by current diagnostic @entity78 strains of resistant bacteria have been seen in patients , although they have been created in the laboratory , said dr @entity83 , of @entity31			1
he said : ' until now a person treated with antibiotics with a reoccurring infection of @entity10 was assumed to have been re-infected			0
' the current gaps in our understanding of the population makeup of @entity3 limit our ability to implement health policies , because we do not fully understand how @entity3 spreads within our population			0
' the findings are also important for the treatment of @entity3 , a form of the bacteria that can cause eye infection trachoma or blindness			0
these strains also use recombination to avoid the immune system , said dr @entity103 , from the @entity104			1
he said : ' for many years various groups have observed co-circulating strains of @entity3 causing trachoma			0
in our study we have shown that some strains appear to have swapped only their surface coat			1
' this provides real clues as to how this bacterium is able to avoid the human immune system and cause disease			1
' more than 150,000 adults aged under 25 tested positive for chlamydia in @entity119 in 2010			1
however , most people do n't noticed any symptoms and so do n't know they have it			1
the std is treated with anti-biotics			0
however , the @entity125 warns it can cause problems such as pelvic inflammatory disease and infertility if left untreated			0
anyone under 25 in the @entity29 can get a free and confidential chlamydia test			1

more than 150,000 people aged under 25 in @entity119 tested positive for chlamydia in 2010
