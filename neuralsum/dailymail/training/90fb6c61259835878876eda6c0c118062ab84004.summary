under the scam , the fraudsters call their victims on the phone , pretending to be from their bank or a utility company			1
they tell the elderly person there has been fraud committed against their bank account or that they have not paid a bill			2
the conmen then offer to send someone to the victim ’s house to pick up their bank card in order to sort out the fraud or to settle the bill			1
at some point , as part of their ‘ plausible ’ act , the conmen also manage to obtain the victim ’s pin from them			2
