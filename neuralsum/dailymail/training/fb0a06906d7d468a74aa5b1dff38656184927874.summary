a @entity1 citizen whose family believe he is being tortured by @entity4 secret agents has suddenly had all his rights as a @entity1 national removed by the home secretary			1
@entity8 – who @entity9 once tried to recruit as a spy – has been deprived of his @entity1 passport , denied access to consular assistance and may never return to @entity1			1
he is thought to be being held in an @entity15 prison			2
@entity20 and @entity21 , the parents of the 23 - year - old care worker from @entity18 , @entity19 , became concerned for his safety after being tipped off that in the summer he had been taken to a prison in the @entity15 state of @entity25 while visiting neighbouring @entity26			1
prisoner : @entity8 ( pictured left ) is believed to be held at a @entity4 camp in @entity25 after he had his rights as a @entity1 national removed by the home secretary @entity31 ( pictured left ) the information was passed on by another prisoner who said mr @entity8 claimed he had been ‘ mistreated ’ and was being interrogated by men working for @entity4			1
the @entity35 has established that while mr @entity8 was out of @entity1 , home secretary @entity31 used a little - known power – which does not require a court order – to deprive him of all his rights as a @entity1 national			1
it can also be revealed that mrs may has issued at least another nine orders against @entity1 nationals			0
the majority have been served on @entity46 men , although the most public case is that of @entity49 spy @entity48 , who had been married to a @entity1 national			1
mr @entity8 and his family moved to the @entity1 from @entity26 when he was five			1
in late 2009 he returned to the capital @entity53 where he had met his wife , whom he married last year and with whom he has a child			0
his parents found out about his detention only after the other prisoner had been released and returned to @entity26 where he made contact with mr @entity8 ’s relatives			1
in a desperate attempt to find mr @entity8 , his mother - in - law travelled from @entity53 to @entity25 , but despite repeated requests prison staff refused to say if he was there			1
the family has also approached the @entity25 and @entity4 authorities but have been given no information about mr @entity8			1
the deprivation of citizenship order signed by mrs may says mr @entity8 has lost his rights to live in the @entity1 because of the ‘ public good ’			1
the @entity4 have built a large base to combat terrorist groups across the continent at @entity76 in @entity25 a letter adds : ‘ the @entity9 assess that you have been involved in @entity80 extremism and present a risk to the national security of the @entity1 due to your extremist activities			1
’ mr @entity8 has not been told of what he is accused , nor is it clear whether he knows he is no longer a @entity1 citizen			1
human rights lawyers said he may be the victim of a new @entity88 policy in which @entity1 is denying @entity1 nationals citizenship when they find themselves in serious trouble in foreign countries			2
@entity94 , @entity95 , prominent human rights barrister , said : ‘ the increase in orders under this government of depriving @entity1 people of their citizenship on non-conducive grounds is a matter of concern because it is always very difficult to challenge fairly			0
it means people are being deprived of their rights as a @entity1 citizen on the say - so of security officials who ca n’t be challenged in court			2
’ @entity109 , the human rights group that campaigns against secret detentions , believes mr @entity8 may be the victim of an @entity4 rendition programme in which suspects are unlawfully taken to third - party states where they are illegally detained and tortured			0
the order issued by mrs may can be used only against a @entity1 national who has dual citizenship			1
it is not clear if mr @entity8 can still claim @entity26 nationality because he left @entity26 for the @entity1 when he was so young			1
in 2009 , mr @entity8 complained to his mp @entity121 ( pictured ) human rights group are concerned that he may now be held at @entity76 in @entity25 where the @entity4 have built a large base to combat terrorist groups across the continent			2
it is also where many of the @entity4 drone attacks in @entity15 are co-ordinated			0
but in a legal @entity130 the @entity4 @entity129 in @entity19 has written to the family , denying any involvement in mr @entity8 ’s detention , stating that if mr @entity8 is a @entity1 citizen then he must contact the @entity134			2
last night his mother said : ‘ we are very worried about him and just want to know what has happened			0
’ the only justification mrs may has given for removing mr @entity8 ’s citizenship is his alleged involvement in @entity143 extremism			0
but his family say he has never been interested in any kind of extremist behaviour			0
in 2009 mr @entity8 complained to his mp @entity121 and the @entity147 , the body which oversees @entity9 , that he was being harassed by security officers because he had refused to work as a spy in his @entity151			2
in april that year , when he was working as a care worker for a very ill man in @entity19 , mr @entity8 had gone to @entity154 to take a plane to visit his sick grandmother in @entity25			2
but as he was checking in he was stopped by two plainclothes officers			0
one identified himself as ‘ @entity159 ’ and said he was working for @entity9 , mr @entity8 said in his complaint to the tribunal			2
mr @entity8 said : ‘ he warned me not to get on the flight			0
he said , “ whatever happens to you outside the @entity1 is not our responsibility			0
’ mr @entity8 continued with his flight but at @entity25 airport he was stopped at passport control , held for 16 hours and then deported back to the @entity1			1
he claims @entity25 security officers told him their orders came from @entity19			0
after landing at @entity173 he was detained again and visited by ‘ @entity159 ’			0
‘ he said it was them who sent me back because i was a terror suspect			0
’ mr @entity8 alleged the officer made it clear his ‘ suspect ’ status and travel restrictions would be lifted only if he agreed to co-operate with @entity9			1
‘ he said , “ by co-operating with us we know you ’re not guilty ” ' mr @entity8 refused and complained to the tribunal and mr @entity121			0
his lawyers , solicitor @entity187 and barrister @entity188 , say mr @entity8 left for @entity26 in december 2009 to visit his family and intended to return to the @entity1 in the near future to study engineering			1
mr @entity187 said : ‘ it seems his imprisonment in @entity25 is the execution of a threat made in 2009 by @entity9			2
what sort of country is this when you are spirited away to another state and your own @entity88 ’s response is to take away your citizenship ? ’ in a letter to the @entity204 the @entity8 family lawyers have asked for information that will help them provide legal representation to mr @entity8 during his detention			0
the @entity204 responded : ‘ it has been the policy of successive governments neither to confirm or deny speculation , allegations or assertion in respect of intelligence matters			0
this policy is maintained , and accordingly the secretary of state can neither confirm nor deny the allegations made on behalf of your client			0

@entity8 is thought to be in prison in the @entity15 state of @entity25
while he was visiting @entity26 , @entity31 deprived him of all his rights as a @entity1 national
he was accused of extremist activities but his parents say this is wrong
after landing at @entity173 , he was approached by @entity9 who said his ' suspect status ' would be cleared if he ' co-operated ' with them
