by @entity0 published : 09:06 est , 28 march 2013 updated : 09:25 est , 28 march 2013 @entity1 and @entity2 with their 100 kilogram meteorite a rock used by a @entity7 farmer for more than 30 years to press ham has turned out to be an iron meteorite worth at least Â£ 3.5million			1
@entity2 found the 100kg rock , which measures just 45x31x20cm , as he was tending to livestock with his father in a field near @entity14 in 1980			1
believing it to be military scrap from the country 's civil war , it sat on his patio for more than three decades - its weight used by family members to cure meat			1
it was only in 2011 when @entity2 saw a tv report on meteorite sightings over @entity7 that he got in touch with geologist @entity29			1
after extensive anaylsis , the rock was confirmed to be a pre-historic metallic meteorite - a solid piece of debris from an asteroid or comet that survived an impact with the @entity39 's surface			1
it is the fourth such meteorite to be found in @entity7			0
previous ones were found near @entity42 , in 1898 , near @entity43 in 1912 and near @entity44 in 1950			0
@entity29 said : ' the object remained buried and because of that survived the times of the most demand for metals			0
' @entity51 's @entity50 opened a display , featuring the fragment broken off for testing , on wednesday			2
it is alongside a replica of the original			0
@entity2 , who officially owns the meteorite with his brother @entity1 , told @entity7 news agency @entity60 on thursday they are weighing up whether to put it up for sale			1
the siblings said they would like it to be ' sold quietly ' provided they receive ' a tempting offer ' that meets their expectations			0
the family are considering selling the meteorite - but while they decide , they are moving it to a safe location they told journalists they realised there was a worldwide market for meteorites and that an offer could be made online			2
but they stressed they ' would not be making a final decision in the next few days ' and have not ruled out keeping it for the family			2
the pair have already been contacted by possible purchasers in @entity7 and abroad			0
as they wait for the offers to flood in , the brothers have said they will keep it hidden in a safe place , where it will remain until they decide what to do .			0
