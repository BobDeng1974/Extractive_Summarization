as an avid rugby fan , prince @entity0 is well acquainted with the sport ’s often bawdy humour			1
and when he was presented yesterday with a charity calendar , featuring women players in a variety of nude poses , he declared enthusiastically : ‘ very good shots … i can recommend this ! ’ so perhaps it was lucky for him that the @entity11 was out of earshot at the time			1
@entity11 , who is 16 weeks pregnant with their second child , had left the stadium , leaving @entity0 to attend a tea with former players , organised by the @entity34 , of which he is patron			1
the calendar , featuring the ladies of @entity38 , was presented to him by former ladies player @entity15			2
@entity0 studied the front cover with a dutifully pensive expression			2
in the calendar , featuring the ladies of @entity38 , two lady players mark the month of june with strategically placed boots in august , the girls have a kit check			1
when @entity0 delved inside the front cover he roared with laughter – and held up one image to show another guest at his table fortunately , @entity11 ( pictured ) was elsewhere during the episdoe but when he delved inside he roared with laughter – and held up one image to show another guest at his table			1
‘ he thought it was outrageously funny			0
he was having a really good laugh , ’ @entity15 said later			0
it was @entity0 and @entity11 ’s first visit to @entity24 since the announcement that they are expecting their second child			1
@entity61 accompanied her husband on two official engagements but took a turn for the worse after watching the game			0
the couple travelled to @entity24 , where they lived for three years , by car and helicopter and had had an early start			0
@entity61 was not travelling with a @entity71 doctor , and was accompanied and looked after by her private secretary			0
earlier the @entity73 , dressed in a pale blue @entity75 coat , showed off a very compact baby bump when she and @entity0 toured the @entity77 in @entity78			2
hundreds of well - wishers braved the rain and waved @entity34 flags at the couple as they arrived			0
although the couple left 16 - month old @entity85 at home they were given a plastic model of a fuel tanker , complete with the number plate ‘ @entity89 ’ by workers			2
will @entity0 pay penalty for revelling in rugby strip - tease ? let 's hope she forgives him in time for @entity97 tour three years after their first transatlantic visit , the @entity73 and @entity11 are returning to the @entity99			1
the @entity100 can reveal that @entity101 – who visited @entity103 shortly after their wedding in 2011 – will embark on a three - day trip to @entity106 next month to unveil their new charity , @entity108			1

’ the couple ’s representatives from @entity132 have just returned from a reconnaissance trip and an announcement about the visit will be made imminently			0
‘ @entity11 has never been to @entity106 and she is really looking forward to it now that she is over her illness , ’ a source tells me			1
another source adds : ‘ @entity11 was upset she had to cancel her tour of @entity113 , but now she is over her morning sickness and really excited about @entity99			0
’ @entity11 visited an oil refinery in @entity24 yesterday , her modest baby bump just visible beneath her elegant double - breasted sky - blue wool coat			2
