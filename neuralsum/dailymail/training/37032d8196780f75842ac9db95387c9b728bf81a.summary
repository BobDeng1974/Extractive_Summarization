waiting to settle down : a study has found that women who marry after 30 earn more than those who wed earlier , while the opposite is true for men a study has found that marrying later in life is financially beneficial for women , but not for men			1
the @entity7 has published a report that college - educated women who wed in their thirties earn an average of 56per cent more than those who get married a decade earlier			1
conversely , men who settle down in their twenties have higher incomes than those who wait until after 30 , no matter their education			0
the @entity18 's study , entitled @entity19 yet : the @entity20 in @entity21 , examines the consequences of marrying later , a growing trend in the @entity21 it notes that the average age of marriage is at an all - time high of 27 for women and 29 for men , compared to 1990 when the averages were 23 for women and 26 for men			1
but while women have actually benefited financially from delayed marriages , men who wed earlier in life tend to be more successful later on			2
the study says that childbirth plays a role in these results			0
around two - thirds of lifetime income growth takes place during the first ten years of a career , according to clinical psychologist @entity44			0
since college - educated women who marry in their twenties also tend to have their first baby earlier , forcing them to take a break from their careers , they can take longer to climb the corporate ladder			2
but getting hitched at a younger age tends to be a good career move for men , perhaps because married men ' are more sure of themselves compared to single men , ' leading to more productivity , suggests @entity56			2
not all women who wait until their thirties to get married reap the benefits , however			0
the study also found that while college - educated women profit from delayed marriage , those without a degree do not			1
one reason for this discrepancy is that among less - educated women , the average age of first birth has not risen in correlation with the age of marriage			1
women 's income : the graph shows that college - educated women who marry in their thirties earn significantly more than those who wed in their early twenties gender discrepancy : conversely , men who marry between the ages of 24 and 29 have higher incomes than those who wait until their thirties in fact , among women who drop out of high school , 83per cent of first births are to unmarried mothers , according to the @entity82			1
a woman without a college education therefore has less time to advance her career during its vital first decade			0
delayed marriage is also a factor in the decreased divorce rate the country has seen since 1980 , since couples who wed in their early twenties are statistically more likely to separate than those who marry later			0
the graphs from the study also show that men who never marry earn significantly less than those who do , while the opposite is true for women .			0

the average age of marriage in the @entity21 is at an all - time high , at 27 for women and 29 for men
