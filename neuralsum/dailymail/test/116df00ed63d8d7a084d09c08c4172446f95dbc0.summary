ms @entity0 said : ' @entity42 puts up with it			1
' she added : ' when i get the chance to watch the television i 'd love to tell you it 's high brow stuff i watch but it 's not			0
' i like watching soaps so i will catch up with @entity80 or @entity81 or @entity82			0
on a saturday night when things like @entity85 or @entity86 or more recently @entity87 are on , that 's the kind of stuff i watch			1
' asked what her favourite meal on a saturday night is , she said : ' steak and chips			1
' but she added : ' on the other hand @entity7 does n't have children			2
i 'm not aware of reading an interview or seeing an interview with @entity7 asking that question			2
' so yes , i understand it but i think it 's just one of these things			0
i 'm not moaning about this but it 's just one of these things that i think is just a bit different if you 're a woman in politics			2
' her husband @entity42 added : ' a man would never get asked about clothes or hair or something else			0
' ms @entity0 said she had learnt to deal with the pressures of being a woman in politics			1
she said : ' one of the things i live with in politics and public life is what you wear and i ca n't really stop people doing			0
' it 's one of the things women in politics have to deal with that men do n't			2
men , the colour of their tie is the most difficult decision they have to make every day			0
' so you have to be thinking about what you 're wearing but you do n't want to be thinking about it at the expense of what you really need to be thinking about			0
' it still annoys me when i read really derogatory things about how a women looks because you would usually not read these things about a man and that still has the potential to put women off public life and that 's a real shame			2
' perhaps , surprisingly ms @entity0 also revealed that former @entity152 prime minister mrs @entity28 was ' one of the key reasons i 'm in politics '			1
but she said : ' not for the reasons she would have wanted but because i grew up opposed to everything she stood for and that motivated me to get involved			0
' but more seriously , she was the first women leader of the @entity156 and yet she did pretty much nothing to help other women get opportunities			2
i want to use my time in this job to be completely different			0

she said : ' would i love to think that one day i would be first minister of an independent @entity1			0
' but does that mean that i think @entity1 is going to be independent in the next five years , i do n't know			0
' i just want to concentrate on doing this job to the best of my ability with whatever powers and resources we happen to have at any given time			0
' i 'll make the most of that and do the best i can for the people i serve because ultimately i am a public servant and the people are the boss			0
' ms @entity0 , meanwhile , revealed that @entity190 is her ' bad habit ' as she offered an insight into her life away from the political spotlight			1

' ms @entity0 , meanwhile , was today forced to reject scathing criticised of the @entity6 's spending plans by the @entity207			1
the @entity207 said the party 's spending commitments did ' not necessarily match ' their anti-austerity rhetoric and could result in billions of pounds of cuts for @entity156 government departments			2
it said the @entity6 's proposals implied the same reductions in spending as @entity170 , although they said the nationalists would ' cut less to start with ' , meaning that the ' period of austerity would be longer than under the other three parties we consider '			2

' she added : ' that is the clear difference between my party and the other parties represented in this chamber			0
' ms @entity0 said the @entity207 report ' does n't credit for any increases in revenue for the tax rises that we are proposing '			1
the first minister continued : ' secondly , it gives no credit for the revenue we would increase from cracking down on tax avoidance ... but the fundamental misassumption at the heart of the @entity207 report this morning is this one : it assumes that the @entity6 would cut borrowing by 2019/20 to 1.4 % of gdp			2
' that is not our plan , our plan is for borrowing in that year to be 1.6 % of gdp			0
