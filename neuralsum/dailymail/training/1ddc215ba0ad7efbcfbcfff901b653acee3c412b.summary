one night she spoke to her sister on the phone and noticed her voice was changing			1
she told this morning presenters @entity56 and @entity57 : ‘ i started off with just a lisp and i was a bit concerned			2
‘ with ill health i got over-fatigued , so i thought it was that and went to bed			2

' @entity1 is speech disorder that causes a sudden change to speech so that a native speaker is perceived to speak with a “ foreign ” accent			1
@entity1 is most often caused by damage to the brain caused by a stroke or traumatic brain injury			1
other causes have also been reported including multiple sclerosis and conversion disorder			0
in some cases no clear cause has been identified			0
speech may be altered in terms of timing , intonation , and tongue placement , so that is perceived as sounding foreign			2
listeners can usually still understand the sufferer 's speech ; it does not necessarily sound disordered			2
@entity1 has been documented in cases around the world , including accent changes from @entity110 to @entity111 , @entity113 @entity112 to @entity114 , @entity115 - @entity112 to @entity113 @entity112 , and @entity116 to @entity43			1
there have only ever been 150 confirmed cases of @entity1 in the world so far			1
despite still having a stammer , ms @entity0 said she was delighted when she was finally allowed to go home			2
but she soon noticed people reacting strangely when she spoke			1
she said : ' my daughters said i needed to get out , fresh air would do me good			0
' so i went to the local art gallery in @entity48			1
' instantly , one of the ladies said " will you fill in a questionnaire ? "			0
' i said " no , it 's ok "			0
' and she said " what part of @entity2 are you from ? "			0
' and my daughter got a bit upset and defensive and she said " no , she ’s from here "			0
then , on the bus home , two strangers overheard her accent			1
ms @entity0 recalled : ' he asked me what part of @entity144 i was from			2
'' i thought " what is this , ca n’t people see it ’s just i have n’t been very well ? " ' a few days later , mrs @entity0 ’s daughter saw an article in the paper about @entity1			1
it told the story of a lady from @entity155 upon @entity156 who lost her @entity158 accent and now speaks with a @entity160 lilt			1
mrs @entity0 managed to track down professor @entity161 from @entity162 , a specialist in speech disorders who had helped the lady in the article			1
professor @entity161 made the diagnosis of @entity1 , a condition so rare there were just 61 confirmed cases between 1941 and 2012			1
@entity1 is where damage to the parts of the brain controlling speech result in a speech impediment which leave the sufferer sounding like someone from abroad			1
the causes are unknown , and there is no current cure			0
mrs @entity0 ( left ) says the syndrome has robbed her of her identity as she no longer sounds as though she is from @entity5			1
speech disorder expert professor @entity182 says loss of identity is a common psychological effect of the rare condition however the psychological effects on sufferers can be devastating			1
ms @entity0 has now decided to campaign to raise awareness of the psychological effects people that with @entity1 suffer			1
professor @entity182 , an expert in speech disorders at @entity194 said psychological effects , such as loss of identity , are well known in @entity1 sufferers			1
she said : ' when you hear a voice down a telephone you make judgements about the sex , the age , the mood			0
' you also have a guess at their education , what job they do and their regional identity			1
‘ @entity211 does is robs you of that regional aspect			2
’ she added that the condition is ' not at all well - understood '			0
cases are very sporadic , there is no centre for the study of the syndrome and as a result sufferers are often sent to many different doctors before being diagnosed , she said			0
as well as speaking in a seemingly foreign accent , sufferers also forget words or struggle to speak with correct grammar , she added			2
for @entity227 , these symptoms are all too familiar			0
‘ i have medical students come to my house			0
i ’m a living study ’ she said			0
meeting other people with the syndrome has helped , and she know wants to campaign to raise awareness about how the syndrome affects sufferers , and why a cure is so desperately needed			0
mrs @entity0 said : ' i ’m here to give other @entity1 sufferers a voice			2
' it 's not just a headlines in a paper			0
it ’s much bigger than that			0
‘ it changes the dynamics			0
i do n’t speak like my brother , i do n’t speak like my ma			0
' i had struggled saying my daughter ’s name , my son gets a terrible time			0
‘ you do n’t realise what it is until it ’s gone			0
‘ just think for one moment if the voice you have today , the voice your mother has , if they lost that			0
if they sounded like me			0
