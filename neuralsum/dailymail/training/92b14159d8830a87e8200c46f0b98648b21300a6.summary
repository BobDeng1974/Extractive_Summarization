by @entity0 published : 12:25 est , 13 june 2013 updated : 12:35 est , 13 june 2013 a previously unknown layer of the cornea has been discovered in the human eye , a breakthrough experts say could ' rewrite the opthalmology textbooks '			1
researchers from the @entity7 found the new layer - which is just 0.001 mm thick - within the cornea , the clear window at the front of the eye			1
they say it could help surgeons dramatically improve outcomes for patients undergoing corneal grafts and transplants			1
the discovery of @entity20 could explain the source of a number of previously unexplained eye diseases problems with the layer could also explain many eye diseases that until now were elusive in origin			1
the new layer has been dubbed the @entity30 's layer , after professor @entity30 who discovered it , reports journal @entity32			0
professor @entity30 said : " this is a major discovery that will mean that ophthalmology textbooks will literally need to be re-written			0
having identified this new and distinct layer deep in the tissue of the cornea , we can now exploit its presence to make operations much safer and simpler for patients			0
professor @entity30 at the @entity7 discovered the previously undetected layer ' from a clinical perspective , there are many diseases that affect the back of the cornea which clinicians across the world are already beginning to relate to the presence , absence or tear in this layer			1
' scientists previously believed the cornea to be comprised of five layers , from front to back , the corneal epithelium , @entity63 's layer , the corneal stroma , @entity66 's membrane and the corneal endothelium			1
the new layer that has been discovered is located at the back of the cornea between the corneal stroma and @entity66 's membrane			2
although it is just 15 microns thick - the entire cornea is around 550 microns thick or 0.5mm - it is incredibly tough and is strong enough to be able to withstand one and a half to two bars of pressure			2
researchers proved the layer existed by simulating human corneal transplants and grafts on eyes donated for research			0
during these experiments , tiny bubbles of air were injected into the cornea to separate the different layers			0
the scientists then subjected the separated layers to electron microscopy , allowing them to study them at many thousand times their actual size and revealing @entity30 's layer			0
the authors say that the discovery will have an impact on advancing understanding of a number of diseases of the cornea , including acute hydrops , @entity101 and @entity103 's dystrophies the scientists now believe that corneal hydrops , a bulging of the cornea caused by fluid build up that occurs in patients with keratoconus ( conical deformity of the cornea ) , is caused by a tear in the @entity30 layer , through which water from inside the eye rushes in and causes waterlogging .			2

@entity120 researchers found the new layer - which is just 0.001 mm thick - within the cornea , the clear window at the front of the eye
called ' @entity20 ' , it could dramatically improve corneal graft *treatments*
the previously undetected layer could explain a *myriad* of eye diseases
