their new enclosure at @entity9 - which is being completed in three phases - will boast climbing facilities , ropes , play equipment and an indoor pool			1
renovation work began in july last year and the first phase has just been completed , meaning the zoo 's seven western lowland gorillas can move in			1
a new atrium - style glass entrance has been fitted , along with an overhead glass panel allowing visitors to watch the gorillas walking above			1
@entity55 , who was born at the zoo two years ago , has already been spotted using the glass to slide on and perform roly - polys			2
@entity59 , assistant curator of mammals at the zoo , said the project had been tricky to manage as the house had been rebuilt while the gorillas lived there			2
' good communication between the construction team and the keepers has been essential , ' she said			0
' the builders have been brilliant at letting us know in advance the schedule of the build , so that we could prepare our activities around it			0
new home : keepers say the gorillas have already been enjoying their new enclosure , which is double the size of their last home @entity79 : @entity9 is home to a family of seven gorillas @entity83 : @entity55 , who was born at the zoo two years ago , has already made full use of the new facilities king of the swingers : @entity55 practices her climbing skills on one of the many new ropes ' we have worked hard to help the builders , whilst maintaining the needs of the gorillas , which has been no mean feat. ' @entity9 decided to upgrade the enclosure to help cater for the family of gorillas , which has been growing in recent years			1
the first phase of work was the largest part of the transformation , as it involved a re-design of the right side of the original building			0
keepers had to keep 32 - stone @entity107 and his family away from the building work , which was difficult in winter weather as the gorillas could not go outside			2
the seven gorillas were seen to stick close together when work began but relaxed after a couple of weeks			0
more to come : the new enclosure is being completed in three phases and will boast climbing facilities , ropes , play equipment and an indoor pool ms @entity59 added : ' after a short period of trying to suss out their new housemates , the gorillas soon became accustomed to watching the builders go about their work			1
' @entity107 , our 30 - year - old silverback , could quite often be found watching the builders and keepers quickly learnt that @entity107 liked to see what was going on and oversee the work			0
' @entity131 , mum to @entity55 our almost two - year - old gorilla , also enjoyed having the builders to watch every day			0
' the first phase of the gorilla house will be open to the public tomorrow , with the two other phases due for completion by early 2014 .			0
