more than 1,000 alleged paedophiles have been arrested in @entity2 in the past 12 months thanks to new high - tech cyber tracking methods , @entity0 can reveal			1
the wave of arrests is unprecedented – more than five times the 2012 - 13 figure of 192 – and shows how remote access to abusers ’ use of the internet by silent automated search ‘ bots ’ appears to be turning the war against internet paedophilia			1
over the same period , more than 1,300 children at risk of abuse have been ‘ rescued ’ through the same methods , and given police protection or placed in care – another huge increase on the 569 total from the previous year			2
this graphic shows the fight against paedophiles is global - with agencies in the @entity28 and @entity2 working together this newspaper was last week given exclusive access to @entity31 , the body formerly known as the @entity33 , which since october last year has come under the command of the @entity35 ( @entity35 )			1
the figures above relate its own operations and do not include arrests made by local police forces			1
@entity31 ’s director @entity40 said the key to success is the use of clues in abusive images harvested from the internet to mount investigations into the perpetrators of real - world ‘ contact abuse ’ of children			1
he said : ‘ we are dealing with the real world , but it just so happens that the evidence for almost all our investigations starts in the digital world			0
when we see images of children being abused , we are always looking for the real victim and the real perpetrator			1
’ mr @entity40 , a former senior police officer in @entity61 , added that when someone was found to have shared or downloaded images that indicated a sexual interest in children , that ‘ is a strong indicator that you have a predisposition that represents a risk ’			1
explaining @entity31 ’s role in safeguarding possible victims , he said officers establish whether a person with such interests has children of their own , or is in frequent contact with them			0
a grandfather , found to have been abusing his grandson , was among those caught using @entity31 information ‘ if you ’re arrested for possessing indecent images , and you have two kids , they could be removed from your home , or you could be , even if there ’s no evidence you ’ve abused them , ’ he explained			1
@entity31 ’s success will be trumpeted by the prime minister at an international child abuse summit this week			0
@entity91 will stress the importance of international co-operation , and the introduction of new software which is starting to penetrate paedophiles ’ last online refuge – the so - called ‘ dark web ’			1
mr @entity91 will also disclose details of the new @entity100			0
this will enable police and other investigators to co-ordinate inquiries more closely , and to establish whether a seized image has come to light before			1
mr @entity40 said : ‘ previously , you could have had detectives in @entity109 and @entity110 working on the same image seized from different individuals , without realising it			0
that duplication will now be eliminated			0
’ the @entity35 has 141 staff devoted to child protection but they work closely with other sections of the @entity35 , especially those dealing with cyber and organised crime			0
it co-ordinates closely with @entity2 ’s 45 local police forces , security and intelligence services , sister agencies in 40 countries , and @entity35 officers stationed abroad			1
a second offender was caught blackmailing a girl to perform sexual acts over a webcam after she alerted @entity31 using its new ' @entity31 ' button as well as law enforcement , @entity31 includes a strong educational component			0
it works with teachers and social workers to warn children of the risks of abuse			0
in the past year , said mr @entity40 , 3.4 million children have received educational material , and have become aware of the ‘ @entity148 ’ button now embedded in many websites – a means for children to contact @entity31 staff around the clock			2
at @entity31 ’s core , however , is the development of intelligence from the internet			2
mr @entity40 said : ‘ it used to be the case that unless a victim came forward and spoke up , we were blind			0
now digital images give us a starting point			2
we are looking for the real world , contact offence			0
the digital offence gets us through the door			0
’ estimates of the proportion of men who both view online images and commit contact abuse vary wildly : between 16 and more than 60 per cent			2
but is evident there is an enormous overlap			0
at the same time , mr @entity40 pointed out , contact offences might well start online			0
‘ often a paedophile will groom his victim using the internet , then arrange to meet			2
’ one critical source of information is @entity176 , the @entity177 , which sends @entity31 about 1,200 tip - offs every month gleaned from the vast web servers based in @entity28			2
two children were put under police protection after @entity31 discovered a man was going to sell viewings of him raping a child @entity176 gets its information from automated search tools , which identify known abusive images by their digital fingerprints and paedophile ‘ chat ’ through keywords			1
@entity176 looks for @entity191 ( internet protocol ) addresses , which will reveal whether a suspected paedophile is based in @entity2			1
until now , like professional criminals , some paedophiles have tried to conceal their locations by using the ‘ dark web ’ – software that hides ip addresses by routing internet communications through numerous ‘ front ’ addresses in many different countries			1
understandably , mr @entity40 and his colleagues are cagey about the methods they use to penetrate this secrecy			0
but sources say they are making rapid progress			0
an @entity35 spokeswoman said that while it was proud of the 1,000 arrests this year , the rise ought to be treated with caution as 700 of them had stemmed from a single inquiry called @entity214			1
it is likely that the number of arrests will fall next year			2
but she added : ‘ offenders need to know that the internet is not a safe anonymous space for accessing indecent images			1
they leave a digital footprint – and we will find it			0

investigators are now using automated ' search bots ' to track offenders
