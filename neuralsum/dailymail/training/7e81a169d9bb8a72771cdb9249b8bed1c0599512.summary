by @entity0 last updated at 12:33 pm on 30th june 2011 @entity1 launched a scathing attack on super-rich jet owners yesterday as he desperately looked for a way to deal with the country 's spiraling debt			1
the president focused attention on class differences as he sought to increase taxes for people earning over $ 250,000 and tackle the @entity12 over their plans for the economy			1
but outraged critics retaliated by pointing out that just running a private jet costs $ 500,000 a year - far more than a family earning $ 250,000 could afford			1
meanwhile , the average jet costs $ 5m just to buy			1
chided : president @entity1 attacked @entity12 lawmakers today they suggested that @entity1 's announcements at a conference on monday were simply a smokescreen in order to raise taxes among middle - class families			1
republicans and the tea party want to tackle debt by cutting public services while also lowering taxes for the average citizen			2
@entity1 said that @entity32 had agreed to billions of dollars in budget cuts that would inevitably lose them votes			1
but he accused @entity12 of refusing to compromise by not agreeing to eliminate tax breaks to owners of corporate jets and profit - rich oil companies			1
' i 'm proposing we get rid of are tax breaks for millionaires and billionaires , tax breaks for oil companies and hedge fund managers and corporate jet owners , ' @entity1 said			1
the president said @entity32 had already shown they were ready to ' take on their sacred cows ' by agreeing to big cuts in programs important to the party and its supporters			2
republicans must be too , he said			2
' i 've said to @entity12 leaders , '' you go talk to your constituents and ask them , are you willing to compromise your kids ' safety so some corporate - jet owner can get a tax break ? '' ' mocking : in a personal touch @entity1 used his daughter 's @entity66 and @entity68 as examples of good time keeping tough : @entity1 on wednesday vowed to keep pressure on the @entity73 terror group following the death of @entity75 luxury : private jets coast around $ 5m and $ 500,000 a year to run - far more than somebody earning $ 250,000 could afford @entity1 mentioned corporate jets three more times before moving on			1
but he provoked anger after it was pointed out that hundreds of wealthy @entity83 donors - who @entity1 has rewarded with cushy jobs in government - fly on corporate jets			1
commentators also highlighted the amount of private trips @entity1 takes on private jets when going for family holidays			1
for the third consecutive year @entity1 is planning to return to @entity91 for vacation this summer , according to a @entity94 official			1
the @entity66 are scheduled to spend seven to 10 days on the island in the @entity96 in @entity97 in mid- to late august , according to the official			2
arrangements for @entity94 staff members and @entity102 personnel who travel with the @entity66 have been made			0
@entity1 has began focusing on the economy after repeated warnings from financial organisations and appalling poll ratings			1
the @entity107 says it must be able to borrow more money by august 2 or the @entity109 faces an unprecedented default on its mounting $ 14.3 trillion debt , predicted to grow by $ 1.4 trillion by the end of this fiscal year , which ends sept. 30			1
one rule for them ... the @entity66 will fly in their private jet to the holiday island of @entity91 this summer for the third consecutive time @entity1 , facing a re-election bid in november 2012 , has watched his poll numbers languish below 50 percent approval , primarily because of the sluggish economic recovery after the @entity123			1
critics point out that @entity1 simply lacks the strength to take on the federal reserve and big businesses that are pulling government strings on the economy			1
with the coming election fight clearly in mind , he openly attacked republicans for holding to what he called an ' unsustainable ' position			2
regardless , the opposition party says it will not vote to raise the debt limit unless @entity32 agree - without any taxes increases - to $ 2 trillion in cuts to government spending over 10 years			1
@entity1 's aggressive response came with the country souring on the recovery , the @entity12 presidential contenders taking aim at his economic record and opposition leaders in @entity146 challenging him to show more leadership in the debt stalks			1
his re-election hinges on the economy , and @entity1 is trying to restore a sense of public @entity152 has faced such countdowns before			1
a generic @entity12 candidate would beat @entity1 if the presidential elections scheduled for 2012 were hole now , polls have revealed			1

a more accurate indication of the outcome of the elections will come from the polls when the @entity12 nominate their presidential candidate			0
republicans also hold a seven - point lead over @entity32 on the @entity179 for the week ending sunday , june 26			1
former @entity181 governor @entity180 leads the race for the @entity12 nomination but @entity185 congresswoman @entity184 is in second place following the @entity12 debate on june 13			0
she accused @entity1 of failing black and @entity190 communities			1
@entity191 and @entity146 avoided a government shutdown earlier this year at the last possible moment			0
and they cut a deal on taxes in december , days before a tax increase would have automatically kicked in			0
facing what most economists predict would be a catastrophic outcome if the @entity109 can not pay its bills , @entity1 took his message to the @entity109 people			2
polls show a majority of voters broadly support higher taxes for wealthy @entity109 and @entity208			0
the comments came as @entity1 scolded congressional lawmakers while urging them to forego their july 4 vacations and focus on solving the nation ’s debt crisis			2
using his own daughters ' study habits as examples , the impatient president said no more time should be wasted in trying to get a deal in place			0
‘ if by the end of this week , we have not seen substantial progress , then i think members of @entity146 need to understand , we are going to , you know , start having to cancel things and stay here until we get it done , ’ the president warned			0
‘ they 're in one week , they 're out one week and then they 're saying , “ @entity1 's got to step in , ’ he added			2
‘ you need to be here			0
i 've been doing @entity235 and @entity75 ... @entity237 crisis			0
let 's get it done			0
’ in a personal touch to his lecture to the lawmakers who were preparing for a long recess at the end of the week , mr @entity1 insisted the procrastinating should stop			2
‘ @entity66 and @entity68 generally finish their homework a day ahead of time , ’ he said , adding , ‘ @entity66 's 13 , @entity68 's 10			0
they do n't wait until the night before			0
they 're not pulling all - nighters			0
‘ @entity146 can do the same thing			0
if you know you 've got to do something , just do it , ’ he added			0
mr @entity1 ’s vacation postponement demand was supported by @entity258 favourite senator @entity257 , who agreed that lawmakers should remain at their desks until they have hammered out an agreement			2

‘ the tax cuts i 'm proposing we get rid of are tax breaks for millionaires and billionaires , tax breaks for oil companies and hedge fund managers and corporate jet owners , ’ he said			2
with members of @entity146 still bickering in a debate to try and reach agreement to raise the nation ’s $ 14.3 trillion debt limit by the august 2 deadline , mr @entity1 said failure was not an option			1

the money 's been spent			0
the obligations have been made			0
if his bid to get a higher debt limit fails , mr @entity1 said tough decisions would have to be made to decide ‘ which bills are we going to decide to pay			2
