an @entity1 judge has denied @entity2 split custody of his child with @entity6 's daughter @entity5			1
the tumultuous relationship between the former vice presidential candidate 's daughter and her former fiancé has landed their son @entity11 in @entity5 's care for much of his life , but @entity15 wanted to change that			2
@entity15 , 23 , filed to have equal custody of the now - 4 - year - old boy but that petition was thrown out by judge @entity20 - who was appointed to the bench by @entity6 when she was governor in 2009 - who mandated that @entity11 remain in the primary custody of his mother @entity5 , 23			1
staying with mom : @entity5 retains full custody of her son @entity11 , seen here together in june during the filming of their @entity31 reality show status quo : in october , @entity15 ( right ) filed to change their previous custody agreement , in which @entity5 ( left ) retained full custody and he had visitation rights according to @entity38 , @entity15 filed the custody claim in october and @entity6 fired back with claims that he was $ 67,000 behind in child support payments			1

@entity15 could have filed an opposition to his ex-fiancée ’s claims , but he never put it through the legal process and asked for an extension - but not until after the due date had passed			0
this ruling means that @entity15 will only see his son for temporary periods of time , which is the same program that has been in place since the couple split			0
@entity61 : @entity6 ( seen with @entity5 in may 2011 ) came to her daughters defense when the custody battle started , saying that @entity15 was a ' deadbeat dad ' as he was $ 67,000 behind in child support payments at the time , they put on a united front and agreed to co-parent their baby boy , but with the understanding that @entity5 would have primary custody			1
