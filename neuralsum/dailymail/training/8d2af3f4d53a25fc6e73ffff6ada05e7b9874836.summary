by @entity0 published : 05:32 est , 6 march 2014 updated : 08:09 est , 6 march 2014 @entity2 will make his return to cricket in @entity5 's two - day friendly with @entity6 at @entity7 on april 1			1
@entity2 , 32 , left @entity10 ’s @entity9 tour after the first test in @entity12 with what was described as a stress - related condition following a traumatic ordeal at the hands of @entity17			1
but the no 3 is ready to make a comeback and will be targeting a return to the test team			0
hard at work : @entity23 in the gym ahead of his comeback for @entity5 warning signs : @entity5 put out this picture telling bowlers to beware now @entity2 is back in action @entity30 : @entity2 will play for @entity5 against @entity6 in a two - day friendly much needed rest : @entity2 is on course for his april comeback with @entity5 trouble : the batsman , 32 , has n't featured since leaving @entity10 's @entity9 tour due to a stress - related illness @entity2 tweeted : ' thrilled to confirm i will return for @ @entity38 vs @entity39 on 1st april			1
thanks to everyone for such amazing support # youbears '			0
and in a statement released by @entity5 he added : ' i ’ve been overwhelmed with the kind messages of support from players , coaches and fans over the last few months , and i ’m really looking forward to joining up with @entity5 ahead of the new season			2
' we ’ve got a strong squad that ’s capable of challenging for trophies in all competitions , and i ’m determined to play a big role and hopefully contribute to more success for the @entity56 in 2014 and beyond			0
' the county 's coach @entity57 said : ' everyone at @entity7 will be thrilled to see @entity2 return to training after the @entity62 ’s pre-season tour of @entity63 , and take to the field at @entity7 in the 2014 season			1
' having met recently , he looks in great shape and is certainly hungry to score plenty of runs for @entity5			0
he ’s been a crucial member of the @entity10 set up for nearly five years and i am certain he will be back as @entity10 's @entity69 in the near future			1
' disappointing : @entity72 's side were embarrassed in @entity73 , but @entity2 is focused on a return no 3 problem : @entity76 ( left ) and @entity77 ( right ) struggled in @entity2 's position @entity79 when it was revealed that @entity2 had long - standing mental health issues during the tour @entity83 , it seemed his career at the highest level was over			1
but @entity5 chief executive @entity87 , who will serve as @entity2 ’s benefit chairman this summer , said : ‘ he ’s still very hungry			2
he wants to continue succeeding for @entity5 and @entity10			2
’ if his comeback game goes to plan , @entity2 , who has been given permission to miss his county ’s pre-season tour of @entity63 , will play against @entity94 on april 7 and then the @entity96 opener at @entity7 against @entity97 the following week			1
‘ he ’s doing very well , ’ said former @entity10 batsman @entity87			0
‘ he ’s had a great rest , which was very important , and he is raring to go again			0
‘ @entity99 is his passion and i believe he has the qualities to come back , score a mass of runs for @entity5 and get himself back in the @entity10 side			2
’ out of practice ? @entity2 has hardly featured for @entity5 since earning his @entity10 contract while it is undoubtedly good news that @entity2 is on the mend , @entity10 will have to be certain that the problem will not recur if he again faces the stresses of top level cricket			1
they were aware of @entity2 ’s earlier problems - and left him out of a one - day international against @entity73 at the @entity115 last summer because of his condition - and handled his departure @entity83 with great sensitivity			1
yet if he makes an immediate return to the international fold it may look as though it is permissible to quit a difficult , high - profile tour and return as soon as the going gets better , in this case when @entity10 face @entity126 and then @entity127 early this summer before their @entity129 series against @entity130			0
@entity87 , who is undoubtedly speaking for @entity2 now , has no doubts			0
‘ i think the problem was essentially burn - out , ’ he said			0
‘ the @entity134 have helped him since he has been back home			0
everyone has given him a lot of help			0
rest is the most important thing			0
’ familiar pose : @entity2 will hope to get back to acknowledging centuries for @entity10 @entity2 is understood to have held talks with @entity143 , the busy new @entity10 managing director , to try to convince him that he will be fit for @entity10 this summer			2
and a team who are starting from scratch after the worst @entity9 tour in history will not lightly turn their back on a batsman with a @entity129 average of almost 47 and a one - day average of 51			1
yet they will have to be absolutely sure that @entity2 is fully fit before they welcome him back , a process he can begin by scoring runs for @entity5 in april .			1

@entity2 will play for @entity5 vs @entity6 in two - day friendly on april 1
@entity2 ' overwhelmed ' by support since leaving @entity10 's @entity9 tour
batsman returned home from @entity83 with stress - related illness
@entity167 coach @entity57 ' certain ' @entity2 will be back for @entity10
