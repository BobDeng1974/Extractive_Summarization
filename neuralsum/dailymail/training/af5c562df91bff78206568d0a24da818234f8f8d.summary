@entity0 has never been confused for the @entity1 , and so it proved again in the humid paddock on friday when the sport ’s equivalent of contemplative silence — an extensive ban on radio transmissions — was abolished before it had started			1
so in sunday 's @entity9 teams will be allowed to send drivers advice from the pit wall to the cockpit , farcically reversing an edict that was being trumpeted by no less than @entity14 only 24 hours earlier			1
however , there are limits to what the boffins can tell the drivers to do			2
messages about the cars ’ cutting - edge technology can still be relayed on radio			2
coaching them in where to change gear or brake or accelerate are not			0
teams will be able to communicate with drivers over radio at the @entity31 @entity9 @entity0 supremo @entity14 , pictured with wife @entity32 , had earlier backed calls for a ban the @entity35 will stage round 14 of this season 's race for the @entity0 world drivers ' championships hurrah for that , at least			1
the 22 track jockeys , multi-millionaires among them , are the cream of a billion drivers in the world			2
in a statement , the @entity47 said : ‘ it seems to us that information being passed to the driver concerning the performance of his car should be separated from information concerning his own performance			1
why the change ? the teams argued that safety would be imperilled if the full rule change was rushed through			1
some thought they could be disadvantaged			0
race director @entity61 said : ‘ it became clear that some teams would be seriously hampered compared to others , not just in their know - how or ability to react in the short term , but also with hardware choices that were made a year ago			1
‘ two types of dashboard were available to the teams , and one can show a great deal more than the other			2
so in the interest of fairness we felt it would be better to introduce it in two stages and that is what we have done now			0
’ drivers like @entity82 will be able to receive car performance information but not racing tips @entity82 was fastest during practice at the @entity35 ahead of sunday 's race reigning world champion @entity87 keeps in touch with mechanics as he walks the pit lane instead , the full set of restrictions will be in place next season			1
let ’s hope the matter is carefully considered rather than hastily introduced and even more hurriedly rescinded as has happened here			0
so what precisely is still banned ? teams will not be able to tell a driver how his line , use of kerbs , cornering technique compares to another competitor or in what way his gear selection differs from anyone else ’s			2
@entity108 ( @entity109 ) 238pts @entity82 ( gb ) 216 @entity110 ( a ) 166 @entity111 ( @entity112 ) 122 @entity113 ( @entity114 ) 121 he can not be advised where to brake or apply the throttle or when to use of his drag reduction system or other overtake buttons			1
what punishment will be imposed ? that is yet to be decided			0
a stop - go penalty — holding a driver in the pit lane — or moving him down the grid are possibilities			0
that is for the stewards to decide , though @entity61 said the sanction would be ‘ sporting rather than financial ’			0
there are potential problems in this			0
for example , will the race be subject to long post-race stewards ’ verdicts ? will teams deliver messages in code or accuse rivals of doing so ? however , generally , the move to greater restrictions is positive			1
drivers are the stars of motor racing and to denude them of their power undermines the allure of the sport			1
‘ this is not @entity153 , ’ said @entity150 ’s owner and team principal @entity149			0
‘ these rules that drivers should not be aided have been around for a long time but they have been abused for a long time , and this gets us back to that			2
’ in practice on friday , with @entity82 fastest , there was only minor confusion			1
drivers occasionally asked for information but had to be denied it			2
@entity166 and @entity167 press have differing notions over whether ban will favour @entity82 or @entity108 championship leader @entity108 towels off in the garage during a practice session @entity172 claims that communication restrictions will favour hard working drivers the most important question is how the new ruling will impact on the fight for the world drivers ’ title between @entity82 and @entity180 team - mate @entity108			1
amusingly , the majority view in the @entity167 papers was that the changes favoured @entity108 , the more thoughtful of the two , while in @entity185 was largely thought to be at an advantage because he is the more natural racer who does not need instructions to find speed			1
there is logic to both theories			0
@entity172 said hard - working drivers would be rewarded , and that sounded a reasonable appraisal			2
@entity108 was hampered in practice when the red flag was waved when pastor @entity196 crashed his @entity197 , stopping his qualifying simulation lap. he ended up 13th in the time - sheets , just over a second - and - a - half behind @entity82			1
pastor @entity196 climbs out of his car after crashing during practice , an incident that hampered @entity108 @entity196 's @entity197 car is removed from the track by marshals after the @entity206 's crash another factor is the conditions			1
the race is long at nearly two hours and , even though it is held in the night , humidity and heat are oppressive			0
the drivers were dripping wet as they conducted their post-qualifying media engagements last night			0
@entity82 , who trails @entity108 by 22 points , is supported here by his father @entity216 and stepmother @entity217 — putting him in touch at this crucial stage of the season with the man who shaped his career			1
@entity82 said : ‘ they said they wanted to come , so i said yeah			2
i doubt they will be at every race but it is good to have their positivity			0
you have to keep the faith			0
there is never any question			0
it ’s been like that since i was eight years old			0
i woke up believing that i could win the race and the championship			0
that was always our mentality			0
’ @entity87 still holds the lap record of 1:48.574 sec at the @entity31 @entity9			1

@entity0 teams will be allowed to speak to drivers during @entity31 @entity9
@entity14 had *previously* backed call for extensive radio ban
teams will be able to transmit car performance but not give racing advice
a full set of restrictions will be implemented next season
@entity82 was fastest during practice at the @entity35
@entity108 's session was hampered by pastor @entity196 's crash
