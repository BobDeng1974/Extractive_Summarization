a streaker sparked a mass brawl after running on to the pitch at a rugby match to tackle an opposition player			2
the match between @entity6 and @entity7 was coming to an end when the man , whose identity is not known , wandered on to the pitch with no clothes on			1
after lining himself up to catch the ball for @entity7 , he tackled a @entity6 player to the ground to rapturous applause at @entity17			1
@entity33 international rugby player @entity32 said : ' i ’ve played a lot of rugby , but i ’ve never seen anything like this before			0
' the guy had so much time on the pitch , about 4 minutes to do what he wanted ! ' the atmosphere was pretty good in the stadium as you ’d expect between two rival universities , but when he ran on , it got even more charged - it was so entertaining			0
' he lined up as if he belonged there as @entity7 ’s 16th man , crouched down on his knees			0
then as the ball came near him , he executed a textbook tackle on the @entity6 kid ! as the two teams fall into a pitch - side scuffle , the prankster makes a quick exit before coming to any harm the practical joke was filmed by a spectator who said he had never seen anything like it before ' then there was just a massive rumble between the two teams - @entity6 were probably a bit annoyed at the extra defence that @entity7 suddenly had ! ' i was watching it with some of the @entity71 boys and we found it hilarious - we had no idea where the security was though			1
' eventually , play was resumed , with @entity7 running out 29 - 10 winners to continue their good form over their arch rivals .			0
