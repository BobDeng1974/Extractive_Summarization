up to 100 girls are being aborted every year in @entity2 because of sex - selective terminations in some communities , research has suggested			1
an @entity6 study provides disturbing evidence that mothers of @entity10 origin are much more likely to abort girls than those from other backgrounds			1
mps yesterday voted overwhelmingly in favour of a @entity16 that would ban abortions on the grounds of gender			1
beautiful baby girl : @entity6 research from the study period 1990 - 2005 found that the ratio of boys to girls born to @entity10 mothers having their third child was 114 to 100 a much higher than the ratio for mothers of all backgrounds of 104 to 100 they voted 181 to one to make sex - selective abortions illegal , saying the current law had led to ‘ widespread confusion ’ about what was allowed			1
the @entity6 study , which covered the years 1990 to 2005 , found that the ratio of boys to girls born to @entity10 mothers having their third child was 114 to 100			1
this is much higher than the ratio for mothers of all backgrounds of 104 to 100 , and is seen as a sign of sex - selective abortions			1
lead author @entity41 said the figures suggested that , on average , about 100 baby girls were missing from the birth register every year during the study period			2
her research casts doubt on a government - commissioned study which found there was no evidence of sex - selective abortions in this country			1
following a @entity56 investigation in 2012 , the @entity54 decided not to charge two doctors who were caught on camera agreeing to arrange abortions of female foetuses			0
the then director of public prosecutions , @entity61 , said : ‘ the law does not , in terms , expressly prohibit gender - specific abortions			2
’ at the time , the @entity65 issued updated rules , saying the @entity67 stated that abortion on the grounds of gender was illegal			0
but mps say this is not enough , and yesterday they overwhelmingly backed @entity75 mp @entity74 ’s abortion ( @entity16			1
it will now proceed to a second reading in the @entity78 in january , although it is unlikely to be given time for debate in the build - up to may ’s general election			2
the only mp who voted against it was @entity87 ’s @entity86			0
' sex - selective abortions are happening ' : @entity75 mp @entity74 has introduced the @entity73 ( sex - selection ) @entity16 to curb the practise miss @entity74 said the law needed to be clarified to make it explicit to doctors that they can not terminate pregnancies because of the sex of the unborn child			1
she added : ‘ sex - selective abortions are happening in the @entity2 and there is widespread confusion over the law			1
that is why this @entity16 is needed			2
‘ successive health ministers and even the prime minister have been very clear			0
they state that abortion for reasons of gender alone is illegal			0
but they are being ignored			0
' the @entity105 , which performs around 60,000 abortions a year , are still advising women in one of their leaflets and on their website that abortions for reasons of foetal sex is not illegal because the law is silent on the matter			2
‘ the @entity115 ... argue there may be cases where having a child of a particular gender may be a legal and ethical justification for an abortion on the grounds that the sex of the child may severely affect the pregnant woman ’s mental health			0
’ a poll commissioned by @entity129 found that 84 per cent of people believe gender abortion should be ‘ explicitly banned by law ’			0
@entity134 , from campaign group @entity133 , said @entity2 @entity136 women , as well as those born in @entity138 and married to men in the @entity2 , were aborting girls because of the cultural pressure to have sons – often from their in - laws			2
she told the @entity144 : ‘ we have a high rate of women coming to us and saying , “ we are being threatened and coerced to having abortions – we are being thrown down the stairs			0
” once this bill comes out , we can then make sure communities understand that it is illegal to abort on the basis of gender			0
’ @entity87 mp @entity155 called for people pressurising @entity136 women to abort their female foetuses to be ‘ named and shamed ’ by the authorities .			0

research finds ratio of boys to girls born to @entity10 mothers is 114 to 100
that *'s* much higher than ratio for mothers of all backgrounds of 104 to 100
