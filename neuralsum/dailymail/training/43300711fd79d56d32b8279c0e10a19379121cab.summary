when a five - year - old boy began wearing skirts and dresses , he was often mocked or stared at by schoolmates and strangers			1
so his father decided there was only one solution - to start cross-dressing too , as a show of support			2
the family live in a small , traditional town in southern @entity13 , but @entity14 claims his radical decision has given his son confidence in his choice			1
all dressed up : @entity14 claims his example has allowed his son to feel confident in his choice to wear women 's clothing long skirts with elasticated waistbands ' suit me quite well anyway ' , mr @entity14 told @entity13 feminist magazine @entity26 , according to a translation by @entity29 user steegeschnoeber			1
the pair used to live in the well - to - do borough of @entity32 in cosmopolitan @entity33 , where there was little or no reaction to mr @entity14 's son wearing dresses			1
the issue would simply spark debate among parents , he said , over whether allowing it was ' wise or ridiculous '			2
for open - minded mr @entity14 , it was never even a question			1
he would sometimes dress in a skirt or dress himself , during mild weather			0
when they moved to a ' very traditional , very religious ' little town , however , mr @entity14 's son became too embarrassed to wear women 's clothing to nursery school - and asked his father if he would dress up again			1
' i did n’t want to talk my son into not wearing dresses and skirts , ' said mr @entity14			2
' i had only one option left : to broaden my shoulders for my little buddy and dress in a skirt myself			0
@entity59 : mr @entity14 claims that when the family lived in the well - to - do @entity33 suburb of @entity32 , cross-dressing was never a big issue ' after all , you ca n’t expect a child at pre-school age to have the same ability to assert themselves as an adult completely without role model			1
and so i became that role model			1
' ' to this very day i ’m thankful for that woman who stared at us on the street until she ran face - first into a street light			2
my son was roaring with laughter , and the next day he fished out a dress from the depth of his wardrobe			0
at first only for the weekend			0
later also for nursery school			2
' mr @entity14 says his son 's choice is now a subject of conversation for the whole town - and he feels proud of his own role in that			1
he calls himself ' part of the minority that makes a fool of themselves from time to time , out of conviction			0
' he added : ' what ’s the little guy doing now ? he ’s painting his fingernails			0
he thinks it looks pretty on my nails , too			0
' he ’s simply smiling , when other boys ( and it ’s nearly always boys ) want to make fun of him and says : " you only do n’t dare to wear skirts and dresses because your dads do n’t dare to either			0
" that ’s how broad his own shoulders have become by now			0
and all thanks to daddy in a skirt			0

the little boy became embarrassed after being *teased* at nursery
@entity14 says he wants to be a role model for the five - year - old
