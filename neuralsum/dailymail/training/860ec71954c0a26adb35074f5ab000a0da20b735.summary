@entity21 's alumni includes actor @entity38 , governor of the @entity40 @entity39 , celebrity chef @entity41 and former @entity43 executive @entity42			0
mr @entity31 , who was awarded his cbe for services to broadcasting , took up his role at the college in october 2010			0
early in his time there , mrs @entity7 - an employee for 17 years - told mr @entity31 she was angry with how the college handled a complaint she made the previous year about volunteer archivist @entity53			1
mr @entity53 had apologised following an investigation but mrs @entity7 made renewed allegations of harassment and bullying in june 2012 and a new probe was launched			1
this was dismissed but mr @entity31 decided he wanted to replace mr @entity53 by @entity60			0
mrs @entity7 appealed the probe 's findings but when this was rejected she took time off from work			2
around the same time there were concerns about an investigation mrs @entity7 led into allegations about another member of staff , @entity69 , which resulted in his dismissal			1
this decision was subsequently overturned , after which mrs @entity7 met mr @entity31			2
mrs @entity7 was sacked from @entity21 ( pictured ) after 12 gross misconduct allegations were made ' she asked me if she might still be able to sack @entity69 because he was " no good " and he should have done more about his dyslexia , ' mr @entity31 told the employment tribunal in @entity79 , @entity80			1
in early 2013 , upset employees began to make complaints about mrs @entity7 , including that she was ' being very difficult and making their lives at work constantly unpleasant ' , mr @entity31 said			2
' the nature of the complaints against the claimant were similar in that staff advised that she had been aggressive , hostile , threatening and abusive , ' the former @entity5 controller said			0
following an investigation , 12 gross misconduct allegations were made and mrs @entity7 was sacked as a result in mid- 2013			1
mr @entity31 said : ' i know that the claimant has suggested that the disciplinary process was somehow orchestrated by various people within the college as a result of her complaints about mr @entity53			0
i am not aware of any such connection			0
' the claimant has sought to make spurious allegations about matters which do not pertain to her dismissal in order to cause damage to the college and to myself			1
these allegations are untrue and without foundation			0
' the college has sought at all times to deal with the claimant 's behaviour and the complaints about her in a fair and appropriate way but could not simply ignore so many staff in distress , some of whom wished to leave their long - standing posts because of her aggression , threats and hostile approach			0
mrs @entity7 , from @entity19 , @entity20 , ( pictured outside the tribunal hearing in @entity79 , @entity80 ) claims she was sacked after she pushed for a fellow colleague to be dismissed over allegations of harassment ' while i was not directly involved in the decision making process i believe that the claimant was shown on the evidence to have acted in a way which was not only reprehensible in itself but an abuse of power in respect of her subordinates			1
' the college stands by its decisions in relation to the claimant and notes that in the claimant 's absence , the college staff are much happier			0
' mr @entity31 added that he was not aware mrs @entity7 had been suffering from a condition which made her disabled under the @entity145			2
she had 20 days off in october 2012 and had 12 counselling sessions before being signed off with depression in december 2012 and work - related stress in january 2013			0
' the college was not aware of the claimant 's disability at the relevant time , ' mr @entity31 said			0
' having now had sight of the medical reports , it is difficult to see what else could have been done to accommodate the claimant			0
' mrs @entity7 's role included managing finances and budgets , overseeing accommodation needs for more than 200 students , cleaning rooms and managing events			2
' the fact that she was able to undertake these complex duties practically is not indicative of the disability she describes , ' he added			0
the college head added that he knew mrs @entity7 made negative comments about his appointment , claiming he was not concerned with staff welfare - something he said was untrue			1
he said : ' i have always sought to be both equitable in tone and keen to stress the importance of fairness to all			0
' mr @entity31 said he organised a @entity60 party at his home but said mrs @entity7 was not keen on the idea			2
' a party was arranged and was a success although the claimant did not attend this function , subsequent @entity60 staff parties or the annual summer parties that my wife and i introduced , ' he said			0
mr @entity31 and mrs @entity7 are due to give further evidence to the hearing tomorrow			2
