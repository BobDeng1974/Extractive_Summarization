researchers sketching out a ' wiring diagram ' for rat brains have discovered its structure is organized like the @entity5			1
they say the animal 's cerebral cortex is ' like a @entity8 '			1
the first comprehensive picture of how neurons connect to one another found local networks of neurons layered like the shells in a @entity16 nesting doll			0
the @entity5 has countless local area networks that then connect with larger , regional networks and ultimately with the backbone of the @entity5			0
the brain operates in a similar way , the researchers found			1
' the cerebral cortex is like a @entity8 , ' said @entity24 , professor at the @entity25 , and corresponding author of a paper on the discovery			1
' the internet has countless local area networks that then connect with larger , regional networks and ultimately with the backbone of the @entity5			0
' the brain operates in a similar way			1
' the study was published on april 6 in the @entity33			0
for years , scientists looking for clues to brain function through its structure focused on what could be seen — the brain 's lobes , grooves and folds			2
two local networks — one governing vision and learning , and another tapped into bodily concerns like muscle and organ function — make up the inner shell of the rat 's cerebral cortex			1
two others — one governing smell , and another that assembles and makes sense of the information from the other three networks — make up the outer shell			0
this means that certain flows of information are genetically ' hardwired ' into the brain , @entity24 said			2
the discovery is the result of a massive , labor - intensive effort to organize 40 years ' worth of data from peer - reviewed research articles detailing connections in rat brains			0
' the data was already out there ; it just needed to be compiled into a more useful format , ' @entity24 said			0
lead author @entity75 of @entity25 created the database from more than 16,000 reports of connections , which he weighted both on the strength of the connection and the reliability of the methodology used to discover it			0
the process took more than 4,000 hours to complete , yielding a database that is free and available			0
@entity85 of @entity86 subsequently performed a network analysis of the connections			0
a color - coded flat map of 1,923 rat cortical association macroconnections ( @entity90 )			0
the team used studies of rat brains because of the sheer volume of detailed information available			2
@entity24 believes that the database can create an important link between human brain studies — which are largely done as non-invasive functional magnetic resonance imaging scans — and rat brain studies , which can be more in - depth			1
' having a wiring diagram for the brain will allow knowledge to flow both ways between human and animal studies , ' @entity24 said			1
' this allows us to take theories from human brain scan studies and experimentally verify them in animals , and discoveries made in animal studies are likely to have an analogue in humans			1
' ' we 're bridging the gap between our work in rat brains and the @entity120 's work with human brains , ' @entity24 said			2
' if we can connect these two veins of neuroscience in a concrete and meaningful way , then we can dramatically expand our reservoir of information about the brain practically overnight			2
' in the future , @entity24 hopes to be able to expand the neural - connection map of the rat brain beyond the cerebral cortex , some day mapping the entire nervous system .			1

researchers say the cerebral cortex of rats is ' like a @entity8 '
team *planning* to look at human brain in the same way
