a mother of two has openly admitted she prefers her younger son boy and says the special bond is caused by his ' special smell ' - and sniffs him all the time			1
@entity4 , 33 , of @entity5 made the ready admission of the sensory bond she has for son @entity8 , 5 , over her older boy @entity9 , 7 , while appearing on an @entity11 programme about sibling rivalry			1
since her revelations surfaced on the @entity11 website , ms @entity4 told @entity16 she has been attacked and been called ' a freak ' , but that she is ' a normal loving @entity18 '			1
she said that the bond with @entity8 's scent began from the first moment she held him after giving birth and that for the first six to 12 months of his life she did n't want anyone else to touch him or ' rub their smell on him ' because it would interfere with his unique and special smell			1
ms @entity4 did n't hesitate to answer ' @entity8 '			1
when the audience and @entity11 presenters reacted with amusement to her swift reply , ms @entity4 said ' people have already ... you ca n't say that , ' she said shrugging			1
' if you said choose one to live or die , i would n't be able too ... like i love them equally			1
' but @entity8 has a smell that he 's had since he was born			2
i sniff him all the time			0
there 's some sort of smell connection			1
' the insight programme is based on research of modern families which shows sibling interactions can have a vital role in teaching children valuable social and life skills , as well as in shaping personality and behaviour			2
but , the programme researchers said , siblings also routinely get stuck into each other			2
' parents may see this rivalry as part and parcel of the sibling experience , however there is a growing body of research that links early sibling aggression with serious ongoing learning and mental health problems , ' @entity11 says			1
@entity4 says five - year - old @entity8 ( left ) who has the special smell which she appreciates because of the science of pheromones is ' a terror ' while his brother @entity9 , 7 ( centre ) is more easygoing but both boys get the same amount of toys and love and she is a normal mother despite being attacked online as ' a freak ' the 33 - year - old said attacks on her for admitting she is very attracted to her younger son 's scent are ' water off a duck 's back ' and that ' it does n't bother me ' because she is a good mother who gives her older son @entity9 just as many hugs as she does @entity8 ' are such disputes unavoidable , and do tensions always persist into adulthood ? ' insight asks ' if competition and conflict between siblings is a good thing , and whether favouritism can affect this			1
' ms @entity4 told @entity16 that she treats her sons equally and that her older son @entity9 also has appreciation for @entity8 's scent			1
' @entity9 has the same smell connection with @entity8 as i do , ' she said			1
' it 's about the science behind pheromones			0
' they were on the couch the other day and @entity9 said " @entity8 , is n't his skin so soft and he smells so nice " and of course @entity8 said get off me			2
' @entity8 is the terror			2
he 's feisty and opinionated like me , while @entity9 is well behaved very easygoing and has a different personality			0
' they still fight , but there 's nothing vicious or violent about it			0
' they are like puppies or tiger cubs			0
they 're rowdy , but they 're not particularly competitive			0
' the program also explores how this plays out in families from a culture where there is a hierarchical or gender preference			0
guests , sisters @entity161 and @entity163 described how their perceptions of who was the family favourite affected their relationship with their parents			2
' i 'd describe her as a role model to me			0
i grew up basically wanting everything that she had , ' ms @entity161 said of her sister			0
' i do n’t think my parents knew how good they had it until they had @entity174 , ' said ms @entity163			0
@entity175 and @entity176 said their relationship growing up was not competitive			0
' we 're not the two that are going to go out in the backyard and beat one or the other at spor , ' @entity175 said of @entity176 , saying his brother was ' hopeless ' at sport			0
@entity176 readily agreed , ' absolutely			0
' @entity187 , who is the mother of twins said of her children , ' they ’ll compete about who ’s got the most cereal in a bowl and they ’re measuring glasses to make sure someone does n’t have more milk that the other one ' insight : siblings showdown - tuesday 7 april , 8.30pm , repeat wednesday 3.30pm on @entity11			2
