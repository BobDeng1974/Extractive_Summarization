by @entity1 reporter published : 03:52 est , 27 july 2012 updated : 05:46 est , 27 july 2012 a nun who planned to put up a 24ft high illuminated cross in her garden to stand as a symbol of ' hope ' for neighbours has been thwarted by planners			2
sister @entity9 , 68 , had intended to use the giant cross for three hours of daily prayers at her modest bungalow in @entity13 , @entity14			1
but planning officials have rejected the nun 's proposals and described the planned @entity19 symbol as ' inappropriate '			1
sister @entity9 in the back garden of her home in @entity13 , @entity14 where she had intended to put up a giant 7.38m cross @entity23 agreed with neighbours who had complained about the led - lit cross , saying it would ' have a harmful visual impact '			1
the 68 - year - old has said she is disappointed but has no plans to fight the decision : ' you ca n't fight the council			1
i think the @entity33 is a bit easier really			2
sister @entity9 included an example of what the illuminated cross would have looked like in her application to the council the huge illuminated cross would have towered over the nun 's rented bungalow , pictured , if the application had succeeded ' i thought it would be lovely for people , ' she added			1
sister @entity9 planned to hold daily prayer meetings with fellow worshipers at her rented bungalow in the quiet @entity50			1
however , her initial planning application attracted widespread opposition from nearby residents with 19 formal objections lodged with the local authority			0
and even an anti-light pollution group - the @entity57 - objected to the proposed lighting on the cross			0
the proposed cross would have towered over the nun 's property - but the application has hit a brick wall after being rejected by planners sister @entity9 had planned for the cross to stand as a 7.38m replica of the enormous ' @entity68 '			1
but as well as facing problems with planners , the nun also appeared to have funding difficulties after only managing to raise £ 20 towards the cost of the cross which would have towered over her home			0
a neighbour who voiced concerns about the giant cross said she had no objections to the @entity19 symbol but was concerned about the led - illumination			2
@entity83 , whose property backs on to the proposed site of the cross , said : ' i object to it because of the height and the fact that it will be illuminated			0
sister @entity9 hit the headlines when she protested against movie @entity93 by holding a 12 hour vigil with @entity95 , 31 , infront of @entity96 where scenes from the film were shot a spokesman for the @entity100 has described sister @entity9 as a ' one - woman order ' ' the fact it is a religious symbol is irrelevant , it is the size of it and that it will be lit up			2
' in the notice refusing planning permission , the local council went on to say the cross would ' represent an ... intrusive feature within ( a ) wholly residential area			2
' sister @entity9 also hit the headlines in 2006 after travelling from @entity14 to the @entity111 to protest at the premiere of the movie @entity93			1
she attracted international attention for the protest and also appeared in the world 's media after kneeling on the steps of @entity96 as the movie was being filmed inside			0
she claims to belong to @entity120 ’s @entity119 in @entity121			0
but the @entity122 has said @entity123 is not ‘ canonically recognised ’ even if she does do ‘ good works ’			0
she is known to have spent three years with a closed @entity126 order in @entity127 , but decided to continue wearing a slightly modified habit despite no longer being a fully - fledged nun			0
a spokesman for the @entity100 , in which she lives , said she was now a ‘ maverick ’ and a ‘ one - woman order ’ .			0

sister @entity9 , 68 , had hoped to use the giant cross for three hours of daily prayers at her modest rented bungalow in @entity13 , @entity14
but after planning officials rejected the application following a flood of complaints from neighbours , the nun says she has no intentions to appeal
' you ca n't fight the council . i think the @entity33 is a bit easier really , ' the 68 - year - old said
