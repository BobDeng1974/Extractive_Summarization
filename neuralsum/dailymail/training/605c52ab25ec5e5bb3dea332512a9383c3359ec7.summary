the organisers of the newly - formed @entity1 – formerly the @entity0 – have promised to deliver more money for @entity5 's @entity4 clubs and a more attractive competition for fans			1

@entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 will take part in new tournament the tournament was saved following a carefully negotiated settlement between broadcasters @entity27 and @entity29			1
@entity30 - one of the executive directors of the newly slimmed down competition which begins a week on friday – insists the new deal will see more revenue for @entity5 ’s top clubs			1
‘ after 19 years we have now reached a position where the clubs are in control of their financial future , ’ he said			2
‘ we have increased the television money ( with @entity27 ) by 60 per cent to around £ 17.4million over four years			2
that ’s a significant uplift on the turnover of last year ’s competition			2
’ teams from @entity5 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51 will contest @entity1 there is a new business model with five prospective sponsorship slots and @entity30 believes it is a matter of time before more big - name companies join @entity0 in backing the tournament			1
he added : ‘ it ’s a complicated position because the tv rights were n’t in place			2
there 's been a lot of interest from a lot of big multi-national companies			0
we are very confident of bringing in more partners over the next 12 months			0
’ tournament organisers are also pushing for an end - of - season clash between the winners of the @entity1 and the southern hemisphere ’s @entity71 competition			1
‘ if we get the approval for it we ’re not very far away , ’ said @entity4 boss @entity73			0
@entity75 of @entity27 ( left ) and @entity76 of @entity77 at the media launch of tournament ‘ it ’s always a calendar issue			1
personally i do n’t think we ’re that far off because the public want to see us			0

@entity89 is not expected to play for @entity19 before @entity95			0
@entity19 boss @entity96 said : ‘ he ’s come out of surgery			0
