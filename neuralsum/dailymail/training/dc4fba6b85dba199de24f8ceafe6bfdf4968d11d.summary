four @entity1 states and the federal government have padded @entity5 architect @entity4 's wallet to the tune of $ 5.9 million since 2000 , including millions connected to his work on the @entity5			1
the @entity9 economist has been pilloried for collecting $ 392,600 from the @entity12 administration 's @entity10 while the law was being written , but that was just the tip of the iceberg			1
@entity4 's consulting contracts give states and the feds access to a proprietary formula that can determine how changes in a health care system 's structure will affect costs			1
the ' @entity25 ' is what he sold to the @entity27			0
it helped @entity12 's team anticipate what the influential @entity30 ( @entity30 ) would say about various features of the final plan – and whether their costs would officially be considered ' taxes			0
' the stupidity of the @entity1 voter ' let him get away with it , he said in one videotaped speech at the @entity70			0
@entity4 explained that the @entity5 law ' was written in a tortured way to make sure the @entity30 did not score the [ individual insurance ] mandate as taxes			1
' ' if @entity30 scored the mandate as taxes , the bill dies			0
' the @entity78 reported friday that the @entity79 put about $ 2.05 million in @entity4 's pocket since 2008 for consulting work related to @entity83 prescription drug plans			1
the @entity84 has added $ 1.7 million more – mostly for ' expert witness ' testimony – since 2000			1
and the @entity87 paid @entity4 $ 103,500 in 2008 and 2009 for what the government vaguely calls legal services , according to an analysis by @entity92			2
@entity94 health : the @entity5 law is wildly unpopular , according to an average of public polls , and the @entity4 controversy will give republicans new momentum to argue for its repeal of the eight @entity1 states that have contracted with @entity4 to get access to his computer model – @entity105 , @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity39 and @entity111 – four of them have published contracts worth about $ 400,000 each			1
if the other four followed suit , that would amount to another $ 1.6 million			1
some of those fees were shared with other researchers who co-authored his reports			0
all eight used his services to help estimate insurance marketplace costs related to their state - based obamacare programs			0
@entity4 also worked extensively on the so - called ' @entity45 ' law , a @entity40 health insurance plan that formed the intellectual and philosophical underpinnings of @entity5 , and reportedly won a consulting contract with the state of @entity130			1
the @entity110 model he built along with @entity133 economist @entity132 is an attempt to construct a ' single - payer ' insurance system that puts government in charge of health care costs for everyone in the state			2
the sixth in a long line of embarrassing videos emerged friday , showing the two academics testifying before lawmakers there			2
one legislator quoted a newspaper op - ed warning that ' any @entity152 - type health care mega-system will inevitably lead to coercive mandates , ballooning costs , increasing taxes , bureaucratic outrages , shabby facilities , disgruntled providers , long waiting lines , lower - quality care , special - interest nest - feathering , and destructive wage and price controls			2
' in the video , brought to light by @entity166 , @entity4 is seen responding : ' was this written by my adolescent children by any chance ? ' the room erupted in laughter , but the comment had actually come from the pen of two - term @entity110 state senator @entity175 , by then serving as vice president of the conservative @entity177			0
a @entity180 , @entity179 blogger unearthed records on friday showing that @entity4 met with president @entity12 at the @entity27 on july 20 , 2009			1
that backed up a @entity184 interview he gave in 2012 , in which he positioned himslelf as a major player in the @entity5 law 's evolution			2
he saw @entity12 , he said , in ' summer 2009			0
' ' the big issue there is that he really wants to make sure i ’m moving forward on cost control			0
i think that at this point he sort of knew we had a good plan on coverage , but he was worried on cost control			0
' ' so we had a meeting in the @entity200 with several experts , including myself , ' @entity4 continued , ' on what can we do to get credible savings on cost control that the @entity30 would recognize and score as savings in this law			0

@entity9 economist got $ 392,600 from the @entity209 for his @entity5 consulting
@entity79 paid him $ 2 million for @entity43 consulting
@entity84 has added $ 1.7 million for expert witness testimony
four @entity1 states combined to pay him another $ 1.6 million for *advice* about health care laws , and contracts for four more states were *unavailable*
if those states followed suit , @entity4 's haul would exceed $ *7.5* million
@entity4 has become a thorn in @entity230 ' sides since videos emerged of him *candidly* *discussing* how the @entity12 @entity27 misled @entity1 to pass the @entity5 law
