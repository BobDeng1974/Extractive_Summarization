duped : instead of going through to a line operated by the banks , the phone numbers were actually for a call centre run by card insurance firm called @entity20 the salesman at the end of the line would then try to foist the insurance policies on callers - they were sold ' unnecessary ' card protection insurance , which cost around £ 35 a year , or identity protection insurance , which cost around £ 84 a year			1
the banks pocketed commission payments every time @entity20 sold or renewed a policy to one of their customers			2
a former @entity20 manager told @entity7 that the banks even signed off the scripts used by @entity20 call operatives			1
for every policy they sold they made £ 5			1
