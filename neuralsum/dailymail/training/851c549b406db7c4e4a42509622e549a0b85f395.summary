by @entity0 published : 13:29 est , 4 march 2013 updated : 15:08 est , 4 march 2013 @entity2 despot @entity1 says he is ' very lonely ' since his political contemporaries died and complained that his @entity4 is full of ' children '			1
in an interview with the state - controlled @entity7 to mark his 89th birthday , @entity1 said he had nobody left to share memories of the 1930s and @entity12 or of years spent chasing girls			1
he said that his colleagues were much more likely to listen to him than share ideas because they were too young to match his knowledge			1
@entity2 president @entity1 has complained of being lonely now that his contemporaries are dead the president , who is @entity18 's oldest leader , said that 78 - year - old @entity19 , the minister for state for presidential affairs and the @entity21 secretary for administration , was the only minister who could come close to sharing his experiences			1
politicians who were involved with the fight for independence alongside @entity1 , such as three consecutive vice-presidents @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity30 , have since died in office			1
@entity28 died in 1999 , his successor @entity29 in 2009 , while @entity30 died of cancer in january this year			2
@entity1 , who has ruled @entity2 since gaining independence from @entity35 in 1980 , told @entity7 that he looked down on his fellow politicians because of their relatively tender age			1
he said : ' they have not had the same experience , the same length of life and , therefore , the same advantage of gathering as much knowledge and experience as yourself			2
' and so you ca n't discuss with them things that happened in the 1930s or even 1950s			0
' you take my cabinet as it is : there is no one i can talk to about how we used to approach girls or we would go to this and that place , riding bicycles			0
' there are others like @entity19			0
he comes close , but others are just children			0
' you feel that loneliness			0
you have lost others and sometimes you think of it and it makes you very lonely			0
' @entity1 , who is married to his 47 - year - old former secretary @entity65 , told the broadcaster : ' the consoling part of it is that , well fine , there are young ones and young minds you can talk to			1
' you can also try to educate , you can also try to relate a bit of history to and so on and so forth			0
but they remain young ones who listen much more than they share ideas with you			1
' @entity1 's complaints may not be taken too seriously by some , reminded of the 2004 film @entity82 , where a puppet of the late @entity85 dictator @entity84 sings about his loneliness			2
@entity1 's complaints may remind some of @entity82 , where a puppet of the late @entity85 dictator @entity84 sings about being lonely minted : dictator @entity1 had the coins made to celebrate his 89th birthday in the song , written by @entity92 and @entity94 creator @entity93 , the puppet sings about having nobody to relate to while alone on his throne			2
and the president clearly is n't too sad about his advancing years as he ordered gold coins to be made bearing his image to mark his 89th birthday and celebrated the day with a lavish party and four tier cake - at a time while @entity2 is one of the poorest countries in the world .			0
