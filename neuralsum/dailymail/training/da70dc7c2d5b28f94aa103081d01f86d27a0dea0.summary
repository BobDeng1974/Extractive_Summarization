@entity1 ’s celebrations of their first championship title for 13 years were thrown into disarray tonight when their captain @entity5 became the first county cricketer accused of using racial language on the field			1
the newly crowned champions immediately vowed to fight to clear the name of @entity5 , who is accused of abusing @entity12 ’s @entity11 towards the end of the third day of an acrimonious @entity15 match on september 3			1
it became clear that @entity5 was facing more than just a dissent charge when he was banned by the @entity18 not just for two games but also from taking any part in the presentation of the championship trophy at @entity23 last week			2
@entity1 captain @entity5 has become the first county cricketer to be accused of using racial language and @entity1 ’s worst fears were confirmed last night when it emerged that @entity5 would be summoned to a disciplinary hearing in @entity28 next week on a @entity29 or even @entity31 charge for racial verbal abuse			1
the charge will hinge on exactly what @entity5 , an inspirational captain for @entity1 , said to the @entity35 in a highly charged passage of play at @entity38 which opened old wounds between fierce @entity15 rivals			2
@entity41 understands that @entity11 told @entity5 to ‘ f * * * off back to your fielding position ’ when the @entity1 captain was attempting to squeeze in one more over towards the end of play in a push for victory			1
@entity5 then told @entity11 to ‘ f * * * off back to your own country you kolpak f * * * * * ’ which @entity1 are adamant should not be treated as racist and are preparing a legal case to defend their captain against the @entity18 next week			1
@entity5 's celebrations were cut short by accusations that he had acially abused @entity11 the @entity61 regulation refers to @entity11 ’s status as a non-overseas player , a restraint of trade ruling successfully overturned in the @entity67 courts by @entity70 handball player @entity68 , but it is whether ‘ go back to your own country ’ is interpreted as racist that holds the key to this explosive matter			2
@entity1 will ask the hearing whether the same charge would have been brought had the same words been used against a white @entity35 , but the @entity18 are determined to take a stand against what they see as a serious matter			0
it was the governing body who took the matter to its own @entity86 after umpires @entity87 and @entity89 reported @entity5 for a @entity91 offence under the @entity18 code of conduct for using ‘ language or gesture that is obscene or of a serious insulting nature to another player , umpire , referee , team official or spectator			2
’ @entity5 had been disciplined for dissent earlier in the season , which meant that the latest charge triggered a two - match ban that ruled him out for the championship decider against @entity104 but it is the escalating of the accusation which has turned it into a far more serious matter			0
the newly crowned champions immediately vowed to fight to clear the name of their captain @entity5 it was a @entity111 charge that was originally thrown at @entity113 ’s @entity112 after he clashed with @entity115 ’s @entity114 during the first test even though there was no suggestion in that case of any racist abuse but it was thrown out through a lack of evidence by the @entity123			1
now it is the @entity1 and former @entity125 captain who finds his reputation on the line over the interpretation of words that both he and his county are adamant should not be construed as racist			0
the @entity18 , who were criticised for not allowing gale to collect the trophy on @entity1 ’s behalf last week , are clearly determined to make an example of a county captain who is no stranger to charges of dissent			0
yet there will be those who accuse the @entity18 of double - standards because they were so reluctant to become involved when @entity144 was booed by @entity146 supporters at @entity147 in what appeared to be racist abuse of the @entity113 all - rounder ’s @entity151 heritage			0
@entity5 was expected to parade the championship trophy in front of @entity1 fans at @entity156 next week during their final match of the season against @entity160			0
instead he will be fighting to salvage his reputation .			0
