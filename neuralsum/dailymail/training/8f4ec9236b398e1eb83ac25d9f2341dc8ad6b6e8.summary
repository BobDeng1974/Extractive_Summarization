@entity1 ’s controversial tweeting of last month may not have helped his image among many people but it seems to have done little to harm his tennis			2
since sending out his support for a @entity9 vote in the @entity11 referendum in the early hours of september 18 the @entity6 number one has won seven straight matches , a run that continued this morning with his best victory since @entity15 in the summer of 2013			0
after winning the @entity17 title in @entity18 on sunday @entity1 was extremely sharp in defeating @entity20 champion and world number five @entity21 6 - 1 6 - 4 to make the semi-finals of the @entity24 , in which he will take on the world ’s best player @entity25			1
and his cause to make it into the top eight performers of the season was significantly aided by @entity25 defeating @entity42 , who is one of his main rivals for one of the three remaining places			1
the 27 year - old @entity46 may fancy his chances as the signs become more evident that his climb back towards his best level is gaining real traction			0
it took him 98 minutes to beat a player against whom he has a good record , but who has received a massive boost with his unexpected triumph at @entity58			0
it was business as usual between the pair with @entity1 ’s supreme athleticism forcing @entity21 to cut his margin of error and consequently make more mistakes than normal			1
@entity20 champion @entity21 had no answer to @entity1 's quality throughout the contest @entity25 had made light work of beating @entity42 earlier in the day he also punished the @entity70 ’s serve and broke him three times in the first set and once in the second to win the match , after eventually being made to fight much harder in what was a feisty encounter in which @entity1 was lucky to escape censure for his four - letter outbursts			1
there was , after all , plenty at stake for him as he seeks the big wins that have been missing since undergoing back surgery			0
his previous best statistical victory had been against then world number ten @entity85 at the @entity20 , but there is no substitute for the belief beating a top five player gives you			0
while there is long way to go , every win boosts @entity1 ’s chances of making the @entity96 at the @entity97 in november , open to the world ’s top eight performers of the season .			2

@entity1 beats @entity21 6 - 1 6 - 4 in quarter - finals of the @entity24
he will now face @entity104 in the last four on *saturday*
@entity25 had earlier beaten @entity42 6 - 2 6 - 4
the victory puts @entity1 in ninth place in the race to @entity33
