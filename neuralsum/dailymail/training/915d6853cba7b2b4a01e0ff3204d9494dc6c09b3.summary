the decision by a judge to throw out all five charges against @entity3 will raise serious questions about the @entity7 authorities ' long and expensive pursuit of the bisexual businessman			1
pre-trial briefings suggested prosecutors considered their case against @entity3 to be ' water tight ' , ' a fact ' and ' powerful '			1
within days of the trial opening , however , a number of @entity7 's leading legal practitioners and academics lined up to express shock at the poor quality of some of the state 's witnesses			1
in an interview with @entity24 , @entity25 , head of @entity7 's @entity26 , predicted that @entity3 's legal team would apply to have his case dismissed after only a fraction of the 16 prosecution witnesses had given their testimonies			1
in addition to poorly - prepared witnesses , the prosecution 's threadbare case was hampered further by a string of successful applications by the defence to exclude significant planks of the state 's case – leaving little or no compelling evidence to link @entity3 to the honeymoon murder of his wife			1
here , @entity24 looks at the main reasons why the case collapsed			0
fallen pillar : taxi driver @entity49 ( above ) was sentenced to 18 years for his part in arranging the honeymoon murder			0
@entity49 was the only witness who claims to have had any direct contact from @entity3 about his desire to have his wife murdered , but his story did not stand up well to days of cross-examination a poor ' @entity58 ' witness taxi driver @entity49 was the only witness who claimed to have had any direct contact from @entity3 about his desire to have his wife murdered			2
the prosecution 's main claim - that there was a plot to kidnap and kill @entity64 during a fake carjacking - could only be established ' beyond reasonable doubt ' by @entity49			1
in his argument to have the case against his client dismissed , @entity67 told the @entity71 : ' @entity49 is the pillar on which this case rests			0
if that pillar falls then the whole case collapses			0
' @entity49 turned out to be weak on the witness stand - his story did not stand up to days of cross-examination			0
he was described by the judge today as ' inconsistent ' , his evidence dismissed in a three - hour judgment today as ' making no sense ' , with ' poor ' explanations to back them up			0
another witness , convict @entity85 , also failed to impress when he struggled to tell the difference between his right and left			0
the fact that @entity49 benefited from a reduced sentence in return for giving evidence against @entity3 was , the defence team suggested , even more reason to treat his testimony with caution			2
however , even though some key elements of his story were borne out by @entity98 and @entity85 – they too had holes punched in their testimonies by mr @entity67 and @entity101 , for the defence			0
the prosecution had lined up a number of witnesses to testify to @entity3 's homosexuality , including @entity107 ( right ) , known as the @entity109 master , but when @entity3 openly admitted that he was bisexual at the start of the trial , it paved the way for his defence to call for the evidence to be deemed irrelevant @entity116 's sexuality ruled out as a motive the prosecution were not obliged to offer a motive for @entity3 wanting his wife to be killed but they identified his clandestine relationship with men , including a male @entity109 prostitute , visits to gay clubs and online chat rooms as a possible reason for him to want to be free of his new marriage			1
he had kept these visits secret from @entity64			0
the prosecution had lined up a number of witnesses to testify to @entity3 's homosexuality , including @entity107 , known as the @entity109 master , and a detective from @entity132 who retrieved a bundle of sexually - explicit e-mails between @entity3 and an older man			1
however , on day one of his trial , @entity3 informed the court – via a written explanation of his not guilty pleas – that he was a bisexual who had enjoyed relationships with both women and men			1
this was to be the prosecution trump card yet the revelation , less than 200 words in to a 37 - page disclosure rendered the prosecution 's intended probing into @entity3 's sexuality ' irrelevant '			1
it meant mr @entity107 's appearance in court , when it came , was considerably shorter than the usual length of a booking to which he had become accustomed in his professional life			0
this also paved the way for @entity3 's defence team to call for their client 's sexuality to be deemed irrelevant to his murder trial - and it duly was			1
inconclusive : @entity3 wept as his trial was shown @entity165 footage of him laughing and kissing his new wife ( pictured ) as they walked back to their hotel the night before her death @entity64 's final hours : @entity3 strides ahead , hands in pockets , towards the @entity175 seafood restaurant , in @entity176 - an unfashionable seaside town in @entity178 - leaving his new bride trailing behind shortly before she was gunned down on their honeymoon in a carjacking allegedly staged by her husband prosecutor @entity184 attempted to argue that since @entity3 had consistently described himself as a gay man seeking other gay partners on ' hook - up ' websites such as @entity190 and @entity191 , the court should hear more about his conflicted feelings towards his new bride			1
judge @entity193 disagreed and ruled that the e-mails were inadmissible as was the vast majority of what @entity107 was prepared to say			0
the fact that @entity3 had told the @entity199 - based escort – who specialises in fetishism and role play - that he needed ' to find a way out ' of his engagement to @entity64 and other conversations they 'd shared , was not allowed to be shared with the court			2
@entity165 footage ( above ) of the newlyweds , captured by cameras at the @entity211 hotel , was presented by both defence and prosecution as an insight into their relationship , making it inconclusive			2
film of the honeymooners – in the 24 hours before @entity64 's death – could be interpreted as showing them miserable and unhappy as well as playful and loving			0
caught on cctv : in one video clip shown to the courtroom , @entity3 is captured leading alleged fixer @entity49 down a hotel corridor to a quiet room , carrying a small bag evidence : the opening shot of the surveillance camera sequence shown to the @entity7 court shows suspect @entity3 walking through the foyer of the @entity211 hotel days after his new wife 's murder follow me : @entity3 leads the way as he takes the cab driver to a part of the hotel not covered by @entity165 an ' alibi ' for ' secret ' meetings and an improbable plot until the start of the trial , the prosecution were confident that @entity165 film and phone records which showed how @entity3 and @entity49 met , messaged and spoke in the hours before and after mrs @entity251 's murder was proof of a conspiracy between them			1
certainly , security footage of two private rendezvous between @entity49 and @entity3 in the wake of @entity64 's murder provided some of the most dramatic evidence of the trial			1
the first was recorded on the morning following the carjacking of @entity49 's car as they waited for news of mrs @entity251 , who had last been seen being driven away by two gunmen			0
the second was a meeting in which @entity3 was seen waiting for @entity49 on the day he returned to the @entity268 , in his hand a bag containing money which he admitted giving to the driver			2
however , @entity3 's lengthy plea statement to the court provided an apparently plausible explanation for the frequent contact between the two men			1
according to @entity3 , @entity49 had agreed to organise a surprise helicopter trip for his new bride – a plan that necessitated private meetings and phone contact in the hours before the carjacking that claimed mrs @entity251 's life			2
a large bundle of cash that @entity3 had put in his wife 's bag was the deposit for the honeymoon treat			2
it was not , as detectives suspected , a payment for his wife 's killers			0
@entity3 's account of how he was freed from the taxi ( above ) before his wife was shot dead differed over time @entity300 between the time @entity3 reported his wife missing in @entity49 's car , with two gunmen at the wheel , until her body was discovered , the case was handled by a string of low - ranked police officers			1
once her body had been found in the back of @entity49 's abandoned @entity311 , the case was handed over to the @entity312 – @entity7 's elite detective unit			2
prior to the @entity312 stepping in , the investigation was marked by lost notebooks , incomplete witness statements and an inadequate ballistics investigation which had to be re-visited even after the trial got under way			1
judge @entity193 repeatedly reminded prosecutor @entity184 that he had had four years to get his case in order , before scolding him for ' scurrying around ' finalising evidence and identifying new witnesses weeks into the hearing			2
new ballistics tests , ordered by the defence , also appeared to cast doubt on whether @entity328 had been accurately identified as the assassin who fired the fatal shot			0
@entity328 died last month of a brain tumour			0
it was another defence initiative that exposed the true extent of @entity335 's role in @entity64 's fatal shooting			0
previously identified only as a ' link man ' between @entity49 and the two assassins he hired to fake a carjacking and kill the honeymooning bride , @entity335 played a far bigger role on the night of the murder			0
once the two gunmen had missed the first rendezvous with @entity49 's car on a corner of @entity347 , @entity335 stepped in to ' project manage ' the second attempt , stepping in to coordinate the killers on the ground			0
it was only when @entity3 paid for new sound tests to be carried out on @entity165 footage of @entity355 on the phone at the hotel reception where he worked , that the former porter 's true role was revealed			1
although he received immunity from prosecution for giving evidence against @entity328 and @entity3 , judge @entity193 warned him that it may not be extended .			2

prosecutors considered their case against the *millionaire* to be ' *watertight* '
but soon after start of trial , experts expressed shock at terrible witnesses
judge also threw out prosecution 's attempt to use his sexuality as motive
@entity3 provided plausible explanation for @entity165 meetings with his ' fixer '
police probe hampered by lost notebooks , incomplete witness statements
