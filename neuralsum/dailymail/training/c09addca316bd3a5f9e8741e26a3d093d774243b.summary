passing sentence , judge @entity8 told @entity50 : ' for anyone who lends themselves to an enterprise of this nature , it would be perfectly obvious that you would scare the victim with a knife by brandishing it and it was foreseeable that it might be used			2
' it is natural to put up a fight , that is what happened in the kitchen , the complainant came upon a knife , not surprisingly in the kitchen , and sought to defend himself and his property and it was after that struggle between the two men that your accomplice was stabbed			2

' it also emerged the raiders had been given information about mr @entity10 ’s safe from the victim ’s uncle who helped him run a transport storage firm			1
mr @entity10 had been at home watching tv when he answered a knock at the door from a man in a high visibility jacket claiming to be from the gas board only for @entity12 and @entity50 to burst in			1

grand : during the terrifying burglary at mr @entity10 's £ 350,000 four - bedroom house in @entity18 , near @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity12 held a knife to the businessman 's throat ' the panic and confusion that followed caused mr @entity10 to grab the first thing that came to his hands and that was a knife from the knife block , ' mr @entity110 said			1
' @entity12 lunged at him and the two collided and fell to the ground and it became a knife fight			0

' it had an effect in terms of mental health and a financial impact and impacted @entity34 in particular and they had to move out of the area at a time when @entity34 was involved in @entity173 ’s			0
moving away from family and friends has a significant impact on him and what happened to his house			0
