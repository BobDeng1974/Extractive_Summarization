by @entity0 the reputation of @entity3 ’s @entity2 took another blow when a passenger on one of the aircraft spotted fuel gushing from the wing as it taxied for take - off			1
the @entity11 787 was preparing to take off from @entity12 on a journey to @entity14 on sunday when passenger @entity15 saw that fuel was leaking on to the runway			1
she immediately alerted a stewardess and the flight was cancelled			2
i do n’t know who she called but the plane stopped immediately afterwards			2
