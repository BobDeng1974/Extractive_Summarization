@entity1 coach @entity0 says he ’s not worried about the club ’s transfer ban and there was an indication of why on tuesday night as the kids beat @entity7 8 - 1 in the @entity8			1
local press lauded the performance as if it were against one of @entity13 's big guns and not a side from @entity16 ’s third tier who were already 4 - 0 down from the first leg , but all the same 45,000 in the @entity19 will still have taken huge encouragement from the display			1
here ’s @entity23 ’s lowdown on @entity1 ’s next generation , with our prediction on their chances of making it to the first team			2
@entity1 youngsters ( from left to right ) @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 along with @entity41 @entity35 age 25 played in goal on tuesday night but could n’t keep a clean sheet and it could have been two when @entity46 hit the frame of the goal with a header			1
good back - up for @entity0 if both his goalkeepers get injured but with @entity52 and @entity53 ahead of him the path to the first team looks permanently blocked			0
chances of breaking through : 4 @entity35 's route to the first team looks permanently blocked with two top class goalkeepers in front of him @entity40 age 23 picked by @entity60 for the senior squad four years ago but has since stagnated and has not seen eye to eye with @entity0 this season			0
got a rare start against @entity7 and played well			2
wants first team football but despite limited options at right back @entity1 do n’t seem to want to give him the chance			2
chances of breaking through 5 ( 9 once he ’s gone to another club ) @entity40 will leave in january and has the quality to succeed elsewhere at right back @entity38 age 19 the next @entity74			0
could play the position in his sleep and has already made his @entity78 debut			0
ran the game on tuesday against @entity7 and will crave more chances in the second half of the season			2
having @entity83 ahead of him makes things tough but he has the quality to succeed at the @entity19 without question			0
chances of breaking through 9 @entity38 looks set to be the next @entity74 - he could play the holding position in his sleep @entity36 age 22 scored and assisted on tuesday night making the most of a rare start			1
there is no shortage of opportunity for him at the @entity19 because @entity1 have so few options playing in his midfield position			1
@entity102 was a big fan but he has stood still in the last couple of seasons and is no longer young enough to be able to accept playing so few games			0
it ’s telling that when scouts come to watch @entity1 ’s youngsters these days they come for @entity38 not @entity36			1
chances of breaking through 6 @entity36 has a chance because of the postition he operates in but @entity38 is also highly rated @entity31 age 19 has shot up through the ranks and looked at home in the first team at the start of the season while @entity1 were waiting for @entity119 to finish his ban			1
frustrated not to score on tuesday night but was instrumental in most of @entity1 's best football			2
@entity60 has already used him to ensure he plays for @entity16 not @entity124 ( the country of his father )			0
only the wealth of attacking riches already in the @entity1 first team will stop him making it			0
@entity130 wanted him on loan this season			0
other clubs may ask in january but are likely to be turned down			0
chances of breaking through 8 @entity31 shot up the ranks this season and was unfortunate not to score against @entity7 @entity33 age 19 most of what can be said about @entity31 applies to @entity33			1
he scored on tuesday night in a fine second - half display and has already found the net for the first team getting the goal that saw off @entity144 earlier in the season			0
is also in that queue behind @entity147 , @entity148 , @entity119 and @entity41 so other clubs are watching his progress closely			0
chances of breaking through 8 @entity33 has had a similar breakthrough to @entity31 but could struggle for first team opportunities @entity154 age 24 made his first start at the @entity19 on tuesday after a £ 4.4m move from @entity159 in the summer			1
looks a million miles from the level needed to be a @entity1 full back			0
@entity162 chooses the safe option when in possession and lacks the ability and confidence to overlap with any purpose , even against third - tier opposition as was the case on tuesday			1
chances of breaking through 3 @entity154 looks a million miles from the level needed to be a @entity1 full - back @entity37 age 18 in terms of raw talent it ’s all there : the speed , the power , the aggression , the audacity			1
his goal summed up what a prospect he is			0
time will tell , whether , when surrounded by better players he also has the decision - making skills to reach his potential but everyone at @entity1 is very excited			2
@entity1 's only problem is that their four best youngsters ( @entity38 , @entity31 , @entity33 and @entity37 ) play in positions already well covered			1
chances of breaking through 9 @entity37 's raw talent was obvious for everyone to see at the @entity19 on tuesday night			1

@entity1 beat third - tier side @entity7 8 - 1 at the @entity19 on tuesday
@entity33 , @entity31 , @entity37 and @entity38 among those to impress
but will they rise to the top from @entity204 like @entity147
