@entity0 insists cup success will help not hinder his promotion target – and he was true to his word on tuesday night			2
the @entity5 boss picked his strongest possible team for his club 's 33rd game of the season to chase the financial bonanza of a live tv clash with @entity12			1
and he was rewarded as former @entity14 starlet @entity13 scored twice to clinch the prize			1
they were already due to play seven games in january as they bid to reach @entity76 in the @entity77 as well as get some glitz in the @entity79			1
@entity0 said : ' some people say a lot of games and a promotion run ca n't go hand in hand but we want to prove that wrong			2
' this club had been getting a bit flat almost ever since they lost the play - off final when they might have got into the @entity90 in 2008			1
we 've managed to get an up feeling again , and we need to keep it rolling			2
' i 'm pleased most of all for the chairman			2
he 's put in £ 50million and all he got was relegated , and is now putting in another £ 40million for a new stadium			0
he 's enjoying seeing the team win again			0
' but the win was reward for an attacking intent that @entity0 's team showed as they picked the game up after a flat first 25 minutes			0
and nobody celebrated the opener from @entity13 – who calls himself @entity105 – more than the manager as he stood in the rain in front of his dugout			1
@entity18 boss @entity61 had been forced to hand a full debut to rookie keeper @entity41 after @entity111 recalled @entity112 from a loan spell			0
but the 21 - year - old @entity114 , let go by @entity115 last summer , could n't have asked for a more gentle reintroduction to first team football			1
it was 25 minutes before he had to make a save , easily getting behind wing back @entity123 's tame shot			0
but having survived that , the youngster really needed more protection from his defenders and did n't get it			0
@entity5 's @entity30 ( centre ) jumps above @entity46 ( left ) and @entity44 to head the ball @entity129 ( left ) chases @entity18 ' @entity49 during the cup match @entity131 ( left ) puts in a challenge on @entity30 ( centre ) during the @entity79 third round replay centre - half @entity135 was left unmarked to meet a corner with a firm header , and though @entity41 got a hand to it the ball bounced in the six yard box for @entity143 to outjump everybody and head home			1
it was no more than @entity5 deserved			1
their three - at the - back formation allowed them to open the game up and create danger from the wings where the pace of @entity123 created trouble			2
but ironically @entity123 had to come to their rescue as a defender right on half time , clearing off the line after @entity48 had picked his way past two tackles to fire off a shot			0
and straight after that keeper @entity162 saved smartly from @entity45 when the @entity164 full back broke forward			0
@entity41 did his confidence the world of good with a save straight after the interval , getting in the way of @entity129 's close range header			0
and that seemed to inspire the rest of his team as they went in search of an equaliser , with @entity61 throwing on more attacking substitutes to chase the game			0
@entity46 missed from a few yards , but the do - or - die tactics backfired with 12 minutes left as @entity13 got the ball on the half way line and ran all the way – ignoring two team mates before tucking it home with his left foot			1
here are the attacking stats from @entity5 's win against @entity18 - now click here for more from our brilliant @entity190 @entity5 's @entity192 ( left ) and @entity18 ' @entity194 challenge for the ball @entity123 ( left ) and @entity45 battle for the ball as both teams bid for a place in the fourth round @entity5 supporters watch from the @entity202 as their club go through to the fourth round			1

@entity13 scored twice to seal *victory* for @entity5
the *robins* take on @entity12 in the @entity79 fourth round
the club will inevitably face a fixture pile - up as a result
