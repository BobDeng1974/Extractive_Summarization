unfortunately , there was not nearly as much action on the pitch in @entity3 as there had been in the @entity7 city ’s main square earlier in the day			1
@entity9 manager @entity8 will be pleased enough that another away draw in the @entity11 leaves his side top of @entity13 with two of their remaining three games at home			1
but 7,000 travelling @entity18 had precious little to get excited about inside @entity19 after a tough 24 hours which saw some of them attacked by hooded hooligans and others tear - gassed by police			2
@entity9 midfielder @entity26 is involved in a confrontation during @entity9 's goalless draw against @entity3 in the @entity11 the @entity9 man took angst against @entity31 for remonstrating after a penalty appeal for @entity3 was waved away @entity33 , the 19 - year - old on loan at @entity3 from @entity35 , takes on veteran @entity9 defender @entity36 ( left ) in thursday 's match @entity3 ( 4 - 1 - 2 - 3 ) : @entity39 6 ; @entity40 6 , @entity41 7 , @entity42 6 , @entity43 6.5 ; @entity44 6.5 ( @entity45 86 ) ; @entity46 6 , @entity47 6.5 ; @entity48 6.5 , @entity49 5.5 ( @entity50 73 5.5 ) , @entity51 6			1
subs not used : @entity54 ( @entity53 ) , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 booked : @entity40 @entity9 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity59 6 ; @entity36 6.5 , @entity60 6.5 , @entity61 6 , @entity62 6.5 ; @entity63 6 , @entity64 6 ; @entity65 5.5 ( @entity66 82 ) , @entity67 5.5 ( @entity68 90 ) , @entity26 5.5 ( @entity69 64 6 ) ; @entity70 6 subs not used : @entity72 ( @entity53 ) , @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 booked : @entity63 , @entity26 referee : @entity77 ( @entity78 ) 6.5 man of the match : @entity41 @entity8 blamed the heavy pitch for stopping the game coming to life , but equally the two young stars of the show also failed to shine			1
@entity67 , on his @entity87 debut , was caught by an elbow , forcing him to play most of the first half with a head bandage before having stitches at half - time			1
likewise , @entity3 ’s £ 10million striker @entity33 , on loan from @entity35 and the likely long - term replacement for @entity95 , showed flashes of promise but was generally well marshalled by @entity60			2
he did not look the immediate answer to @entity100 ’ @entity102 goalscoring problems			0
@entity8 was proud of the way his side tamed the 19 - year - old			2
he said : ‘ @entity51 is a talent			0
he has pace but he needs space to be at his best and we stopped his service , particularly the two centre backs			0
’ @entity8 has been accused of being defensively naive so will take pleasure from grinding out draws in @entity114 and @entity3 to go with the 4 - 1 home win over @entity116 , leaving @entity9 odds - on to reach the knockout stages			1
pre-match talk was of the police raid on the city - centre @entity121 during the afternoon , in which pepper spray and tear gas were used to disperse @entity9 fans			1
one elderly supporter went to hospital with a head wound after being hit by a gas canister and @entity131 supporters said the police had been heavy - handed			0
on wednesday night , a group of @entity9 fans were victims of an attack by a hooded gang in a local bar and two ended up in hospital with minor facial wounds			1
@entity8 spoke after the game of his ‘ immense pride ’ in seeing so many ‘ bluenoses ’ at the game in @entity7 to support their team			1
‘ it has brought me closer to understanding what the club means , ’ he said			0
@entity70 led the line for @entity9 in their @entity87 outing in @entity7			1
he has one goal to his name in this year 's competition @entity67 holds his face after being caught in the first half of @entity9 's @entity11 clash against @entity3 on thursday evening the @entity9 midfielder had to leave the field of play with blood pouring from a wound above his left eye the @entity165 youngster then re-joined the action sporting a head bandage after sustaining the cut during the first half it was a shame his players were unable to repay their fans with a flowing performance			1
they had only two genuine chances			0
the first saw the ball bounce unkindly for @entity70 in the first half and then @entity65 finished weakly when set up by substitute @entity69			0
@entity3 , eighth in the @entity7 league but with the joint - best defensive record , had more chances but @entity51 shot wide after racing past @entity36 and @entity62			1
‘ i was pleased we put in a solid performance , ’ said @entity8			2
‘ we had some opportunities , but not as many as i would like			0
so you ’d have to say i am half - satisfied			0
’ @entity8 said before the game that @entity87 football would help @entity67 ’s development by setting new tactical challenges for the midfielder			1
the heat map of @entity33 , the 19 - year - old on loan at @entity3 from @entity35 - click here to see more from our brilliant match zone @entity70 tries his luck with a free - kick from outside the area			2
his effort goes through the wall but into the arms of keeper @entity39 @entity201 hard fought point - @entity8 it was an astute observation because this was not @entity67 ’s best showing in a blue shirt			2
in mitigation he suffered a nasty cut over his left eye in the first half			0
‘ it seems by an elbow or forearm , ’ said @entity8			2
‘ i do n’t think it was malicious but if the referee had seen it , the @entity3 player would have been punished			0
’ the game was so tight that a penalty appeal against @entity62 after 57 minutes caused a bit of afters when referee @entity77 turned it down			0
@entity31 remonstrated , much to the annoyance of @entity9 ’s @entity26 , and after other players joined the mini-melee both men were cautioned			0
on @entity51 , @entity3 manager @entity224 gave a curt ' no ' when asked whether he could be fast - tracked at @entity102 in january , but he promised @entity35 fans : ‘ he is a great striker in the making			2
tonight there was n’t a lot of difference between him and the more experienced strikers @entity70 and @entity69			0
remember he is just 19 and needs experience , but i was happy with his performance			0
’ both sets of players from @entity9 and @entity3 came together for a team photo in the moments leading up to kick - off @entity9 fans were pictured drinking and chanting accompanied by blue flares in the city centre ahead of the @entity11 clash @entity9 supporters congregate on @entity247 in the build up to the match after making the short hop across the channel @entity7 riot police in the main square on thursday where @entity9 fans had gathered ahead of their match against @entity3			1

@entity9 played out a goalless draw with @entity7 side @entity3 to stay at the summit of @entity259
@entity67 , on his @entity87 debut , was not his *sparkling* self and sported a bandage after a cut to his face
7,000 @entity9 fans travelled to the @entity7 city with some involved in *altercations* with police earlier on thursday
@entity8 's side are *unbeaten* in the competition with two of their three remaining games at @entity277
