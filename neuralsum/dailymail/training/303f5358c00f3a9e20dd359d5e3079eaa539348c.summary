the local community has been left devastated by yesterdays tragedy , with many mourners paying their respects at a floral memorial many mourners have left handwritten tributes to the victims ' they 're always mucking about in each other 's houses and i 'm just relieved that this was a day when my daughter was n't here , ' said @entity293 as she stood some 30m from the house of death in the dark at the end of another day that has sent shock waves not only around @entity319 but the world			1
throughout the day complete strangers had walked along leafy @entity322 , in the suburb of @entity108 , to place flowers as close to the home as possible - police had blocked direct access to the street near the fibre - cement house where the @entity41 family lived			1
' we 're all trying to work out what happened , ' said one of her friends who had supported @entity293 as the shock had hit her that her daughter - or one of her daughter 's close friends - could have been at the house where a generation of children had been wiped out			1
even in the darkness of the poorly - lit street people continued to arrive as close as they were allowed to stare at the house , the front of which had been shielded off with tarpaulin by police , who were continuing to work through the night under arc lights			1
the brutal deaths of the children aged from 18 months to 14 years has raised many questions , the main one the lips of everyone in the street tonight being : ' why ? ' ' there 's no doubt that if she did this she obviously just ' lost it ' , ' said one neighbour			1
