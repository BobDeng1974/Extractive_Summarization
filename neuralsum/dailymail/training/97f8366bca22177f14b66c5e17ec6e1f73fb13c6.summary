by @entity0 published : 09:10 est , 30 july 2013 updated : 09:43 est , 30 july 2013 savvy shoppers are adding niche books and old cds to their orders to beat @entity6 's delivery price hikes savvy shoppers have found a novel way to beat @entity6 's delivery price hikes - by adding bargain basement books and unfashionable cds to their order			1
the online retailer now requires customers to spend a minimum of £ 10 on some items in order to qualify for free delivery , but any order with a book still qualifies for free postage regardless of the price			1
consequently , unusual book titles and albums by old @entity24 contestants that cost less than a stamp are proving popular after shoppers discovered they can be used to slash delivery costs			2
book titles including ' @entity28 from @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 ' , @entity33 's ' @entity32 2010 - 2011 ' and ' towards a @entity34 ? ' have proved surprisingly popular , after bargain hunters shared their tips on a money saving website			2
@entity6 announced last week that customers must spend a minimum of £ 10 on certain items to use its ' @entity42 ' option			1
electronics costing less than £ 10 incur a delivery charge of £ 3.99 , while products from the retailer 's clothes , @entity48 , groceries , health , sports , home and jewellery ranges will set shoppers back £ 4.28 for delivery plus a charge of £ 1.73 per item , equivalent to £ 6.01			1
for example , under the new rules , a £ 6.75 mug that previously qualified for free postage , will now cost an additional £ 6.01			2
however , customers can cut the overall cost of their order if they add products that are exempt from the new charges , including books , dvds , cds and video games			1
many second - hand or severely discounted items in these ranges cost significantly less than the new delivery charges			2
as a result , customers are scouring the site for these bargains and adding them to their orders , even though they do not want them			0
several exam revision guides cost less than 50p and adding the 32p book ' @entity28 from @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 ' will allow any order qualify for free delivery , saving £ 5.69 on the delivery of the mug			1
a mug selected on @entity6 costs £ 6.75 but incurs a whopping £ 6.01 delivery charge following the retailer 's shake - up of which items qualify for its ' @entity42 ' package savvy shoppers also identified two books - @entity33 's @entity32 2010 - 2011 and towards a @entity34 at 42p that would reduce the cost of orders substantially			1
however , there is often a limited supply of such niche titles as shoppers try to take advantage of the delivery charge loophole			2
consequenly , bargain hunters are trying to identify more readily available mainstream titles to reduce the overall cost of their online shopping			0
possible helpful cds include titles by @entity108 , @entity109 and old @entity24 contestants			0
' @entity111 ' by @entity113 electronic duo @entity108 costs just 94p and ' @entity116 " by @entity24 runner - up @entity117 was just £ 1.27 at the time of writing			0
there are also albums that were former number ones by @entity109 and @entity121 that are substantially cheaper than paying some delivery charges			0
@entity109 ' hit record , ' but @entity125 ' costs just £ 1.37 and ' @entity126 ' by the jazz pianist is available for £ 1.66			0
by adding bargain books or cds to a basket - such as the law book that costs 42p in this order , shoppers can once again qualify for free delivery again and save over £ 5 in delivery charges customers have taken to the money saving website @entity137 to discuss ways of beating the price hikes , which came into effect on july 23			1
user jps wrote : ' you can add a really cheap cd to your order to gain free delivery once again			1
' there are plenty around ... this would then get you free delivery on cheaper products - a nice saving on the 6 pounds odd @entity6 want for delivery now			1
' others used the forum to complain about the new pricing policy , with member lucyferror writing : ' oh dear that 's horrible news			0
' free delivery was always one of main reasons to buy on @entity6			2
it looks like they are trying to save lots of money and lose lots of customers			0
' a user called unreality said : ' this is a disgraceful backwards step by @entity6			0
vote with your wallets people and they 'll soon reconsider			0
' a message on @entity6 's website about the new charges reads : ' orders that include books , dvds , blu - rays , music , video games and software products continue to qualify for free @entity42 with no minimum spend threshold			1
' whilst the change will affect only a very small proportion of orders , it will allow us to offer you a significantly expanded selection of lower priced products			0
' we continue to work hard every day to improve the delivery services that we offer			0

@entity6 now requires customers to spend a minimum of £ 10 on some items in order to qualify for free delivery
but books , dvds , cds and video games are exempt from the new rules
therefore savvy shoppers are adding bargain basement books and cds to their baskets to exploit a loophole and get free delivery again
*consumers* are sharing *knowledge* of cheap mainstream products and *venting* their *frustration* on money saving websites
