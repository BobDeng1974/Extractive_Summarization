but in one surprise proposal that borrowed the @entity1 feed of @entity9 senator @entity8 to get the attention of his press secretary , @entity11 , it summed up to just that			1
@entity16 : ' senator , your press secretary pays more attention to this feed than her own - can i borrow this space for a minute ? ' @entity21 tweeted to mr @entity8 on thursday			1
excitement : @entity21 takes a knee and pulls out a ring before his girlfriend @entity11 in the hall as she tries covering her face but easily shows her excited reaction behind little help : requesting the help of @entity9 senator @entity8 , mr @entity21 did his best to reach out to ms @entity11 , the senator 's press secretary , for a surprise proposal seen here without a moment 's hesitation , he got a reply back			1
best of luck ! ’ ' @entity37 , ' mr @entity38 on the senator 's wall while including her handle to better alert her to his next four words , ' will you marry me ? ' shocked , ms @entity11 's initial response showed two words more than the one possibly expected			1
' what is happening , ' she tweeted			0
fortunately for mr @entity21 , the following photos tweeted by a friend clued everyone in on what her answer really was			2
surprise : mr @entity21 stands before his girlfriend who appears entirely blown away by his surprise @entity1 and appearance before her while holding flowers and a ring seen in one photo , greeting ms @entity11 at the entrance of an office , mr @entity21 - who 's a recent graduate at @entity65 - stands before her in the hallway holding a bouquet of flowers and a gold box in his right hand			2
reacting , ms @entity11 's blonde hair and green jacket are captured blown behind her as she uses both hands to cover her mouth at his surprise appearance			0
he gets down on one knee , with ms @entity11 falling to the ground to do the same , and he pulls out the ring to equally large smiles from both			0
happy ending : the trio later posed for pictures together , mr @entity8 seen on the left of the happy couple moments after she accepted his proposal and ring , seen flashing on her finger ' she said yes ! congratulations ! ' the senator later tweeted on his wall			1
the trio later posed for pictures together , ms @entity11 seen holding up her ring on her left hand still appearing shell - shocked from the emotional whirlwind now forever recorded thanks to social media			0
‘ it is very surreal , ’ she later tweeted a friend on her wall .			0

@entity9 senator @entity8 gave @entity21 a ' best of luck ' before opening his wall to the young man 's proposal
