archaeologists who discovered an ancient site which could be key to unlocking the mysteries surrounding @entity3 are calling on the government to rethink plans for a tunnel under the 5,000 year - old monument			1
plans were announced last month for the 1.8 mile tunnel , costing up to £ 1billion , underneath the @entity10 in @entity11 to help relieve one of @entity14 's most traffic - congested roads			1
both the @entity15 and @entity16 had welcomed the announcement which will give better public access to the wider prehistoric landscape and will benefit local wildlife			0
plans were announced last month for the 1.8 mile tunnel , costing up to £ 1billion , underneath @entity3 ( pictured ) in @entity11 transport groups are also hoping it will ease the traffic jams on the @entity24 , one of the main routes into the @entity27 , which have plagued motorists for decades			1
but archaeologists are calling on the government to rethink its plans after a new site was discovered nearby which could be key to unlocking the mystery surrounding @entity3			1
they warn that the chance to find out about the earliest chapter of @entity14 's history could be ' wrecked ' if the tunnel goes ahead			1
a series of digs 1.5miles away at @entity40 , next to the @entity24 , has unearthed evidence of a settlement that pre-dates @entity3 by thousands of years			2
@entity43 is thought to have been occupied by hunter - gatherers returning to @entity14 after the @entity45 when the country was still attached to mainland @entity47			2
thousands of tools have been discovered at the @entity50 feasting site as well as evidence of giant bulls known as aurochs and possible structures			0
archaeologist @entity55 , who made the discovery of @entity43 , said it could explain what archaeologists have been searching for centuries – an answer to the story of @entity3 's past but the site could be destroyed if plans for a 1.8 mile tunnel go ahead experts have warned			1
archaeologist @entity55 , who made the discovery of the encampment , told @entity70 : ' the prime minister is interested in re-election in 140 days – we are interested in discovering how our ancestors lived six thousand years ago			0
' he added : ' @entity43 could explain what archaeologists have been searching for centuries – an answer to the story of @entity3 's past			0
' but our chance to find out about the earliest chapter of @entity14 's history could be wrecked if the tunnel goes ahead			2
' @entity83 had announced the plans to create a duel carriageway on the @entity24 and build a new tunnel to take traffic away from the world heritage site on an earlier visit @entity3			1
it came as part of a £ 15 billion package of road schemes which also include adding extra lanes to some motorways , improvements to junctions on the @entity98 , to the @entity99 in @entity100 , and on approaches to @entity102 and the @entity103 in the north east			0
the tunnel would aim to ease the traffic jams on the @entity24 , ( pictured ) one of the main routes into the @entity27 , which have plagued motorists for decades but mr @entity109 warned the only chance to find out about the earliest chapter of @entity14 ’s history ' could be wrecked if the tunnel goes ahead			1
' professor @entity113 , of @entity114 has described this as ' this is the most important discovery at @entity3 in over 60 years			0
' experts are calling on the government to rethink plans to build on the critically important landscape			0
@entity121 , of @entity122 and chairman of the @entity124 and @entity125 , added : ' traffic congestion to one of the country 's most visited attractions will not be solved by a tunnel with one exit lane – the current tailback can extend five miles and can take two hours to get through			2
' any tunnel would need to be motorway standard , and even with four lanes there would still be tailbacks			0
' a much more practical solution would be to reroute the @entity24 supporting @entity11 as well as the @entity139			0

government announced plans for the 1.8 - mile tunnel on @entity24 last month
