@entity1 manager @entity0 lamented his side 's ' nerves and panic ' which saw @entity5 snatch a dramatic equaliser deep into stoppage time to earn a 1 - 1 draw at @entity9			1
the @entity10 looked to have done enough to battle to victory after taking an early lead through a superb free - kick by full back @entity14			0
however , after seeing two efforts from @entity18 ruled out for offside and a header by substitute @entity21 hit the post , the visitors snatched a deserved point five minutes into stoppage time when the @entity26 winger crashed the ball into the far corner			1
@entity1 manager @entity0 was left disappointed after seeing his concede late on against @entity5 @entity0 will be scratching his head as to how he can help his side hang on to slender leads @entity1 remain in top 10 despite their late slip - up @entity1 remain in the top 10 , but @entity0 knows their position should have been much more comfortable after witnessing yet another late capitulation from a positive position			1
' you have to give @entity5 a bit of credit , but from our point of view , we did not play as well as we can , ' said @entity0 , who revealed striker @entity43 is set for a spell on the sidelines with a thigh injury			1
' it was not about us playing well or not , it was about winning and we had got ourselves into a fantastic position ' when you are less than 30 seconds away from winning the game and you do n't , that is the ultimate blow			0
' we are very nervous on that stage based on what happened before			0
' we should be on 50 points now , we have thrown away seven points in two minutes or less over four games			2
' we cant find the right key elements to see the game out and leave ourselves on a nervous edge by having a little bit of panic in what we are trying to do which is coping with the opposition when they have to take more risks , playing more direct			0
@entity5 celebrate after @entity18 's equaliser during the dying stages of the @entity70 clash @entity14 , pictured with @entity1 team - mate @entity71 , had put his side in the lead ' while it was a very good goal , we should have dealt with it and kept possession better , using your intelligence to make sure you are doing it			1
' @entity0 added : ' if we had concentrated better in those ( last ) minutes , we would be sitting on our greatest total and finish ever in the ( @entity84 ) league			1
' instead we are scratching our heads on when are we going to finish a game out again			0
i thought we were going to do it today , but finished miserably in the end over just a few seconds			0
' @entity0 is out of contract in the summer , with the club 's owners yet to decide in which direction they want to take @entity1 ahead of their move to the @entity96			1
the 60 - year - old , though , intends to remain professional in his approach over the final matches of a campaign which had earlier promised so much			2
' it depends on what you say			0
do you say what is the overall season like ? it should be 50 points , it should be very , very good			2
it is small margins of victories to draws and draws to defeat , ' @entity0 added			1
' in the judgement at the end of the season , or if not what happens before that , then we talk about what we are doing going forwards			0
' we are still on course to beat the best points record we have had , but we are making it hugely difficult for ourselves now when we really should be coasting instead of looking forward to every game we are playing			2
' @entity0 has revealed star striker @entity43 is expected to be out for an estimated two to three weeks @entity123 forward @entity43 limped off in the second half , and if the problem proves serious , he might not recover before the end of the campaign			1
@entity0 said : ' if it is a grade one off the scan , then it could be two to three weeks , if it is more , then you would be lucky to see him again this season , which is a massive blow but we have to deal with it			1
' @entity5 boss @entity135 felt his side had done more than enough to end a run of three straight defeats			1
' we are thankful for small mercies , because we did not think we were going to get what we deserved , ' he said			0
' i thought we totally dominated the game and should have won it by a country mile			0
' we had the setback from the great free - kick early in the game , and it is difficult when you are the away side to come back			2
' we showed great resilience and stuck at it , trying to create things , but just lacked that bit of quality at the top end			2
' if one of our disallowed goals had counted , i think we would still have had time to go on and win the game			0
' we want to better last season 's total and are determined now to get something out of all of the matches we have left			0
