by @entity0 published : 05:22 est , 12 august 2013 updated : 17:12 est , 12 august 2013 first thing in the morning , many of us need a quick stretch to ease ourselves into the day			2
but @entity6 ’s daily routine is a little more complicated			1
she needs three hours of bathing in oil and slathering moisturiser on her skin to unlock her stiffened limbs			1
miss @entity6 , 40 , has systemic sclerosis ( scleroderma ) , meaning her skin and blood vessels harden and restrict her movement			1
@entity6 , 40 , suffers from both @entity19 's phenomenon and systemic sclerosis ( scleroderma ) , meaning her skin and blood vessels harden and restrict her movement ms @entity6 says that when she wakes up she is ' like the @entity22 ' and that her skin feels very stiff and as thought it is made of leather ms @entity6 must also wear gloves constantly as simply putting her hand into the fridge can mean her fingers turn blue and cause her immense pain			1
she also wears @entity31 boots to keep her toes warm @entity19 's phenomenon affects the blood supply to certain parts of the body - usually the fingers and toes			1
it occurs when the blood vessels go into a temporary spasm which blocks the blood flow ( pictured ) ‘ when i wake up i ’m like the @entity22			0
my whole body is stiff and feels like leather , ’ she said			0
‘ i have to bathe in liquid paraffin and then cover myself in cream , otherwise i ca n’t even straighten my arms out in front of me			0
’ she also has @entity19 ’s syndrome , a condition in which blood is prevented from reaching the extremities of the body , mainly the fingers and toes , when exposed to the cold			1
the diseases are linked , with a small proportion of patients suffering from both			0
miss @entity6 , a barrister , was diagnosed in 1997 after several years of feeling unwell and exhausted			1
it takes ms @entity6 three hours to prepare to leave the house as she has to apply so many creams to her skin she has to bathe in liquid paraffin to soften her skin or she is unable to straighten her arms out in front of her ms @entity6 has to go to her local hospital every month and sees her consultant in @entity71 twice a year			1
she works hard to raise awareness of her conditions ms @entity6 says that for the first seven years that she had the conditions she did not look after herself properly and that she failed to recognise how serious they are @entity76 , an auti - immune condition , results in an overproduction of collagen , which is found in connective tissue			1
@entity76 is a disease that results in the hardening and thickening of areas of skin			2
it is an autoimmune condition which means that the body attacks its own tissues causing them to harden			0
systemic scleroderma , as suffered by ms @entity6 , can also affect the internal organs			1
this can cause symptoms such as heartburn and difficulty swallowing			0
the condition causes the skin to become thick and puffy which can restrict the movement			1
it can also cause the fingers and toes to swell			2
in some cases it causes hair loss , weight loss , fatigue and joint pain			0
treatments include taking steroids and immunosuppressants , physiotherapy and applying creams and moisturisers			0
it affects skin , blood vessels , and joints but can sometimes sink into internal organs such as the heart , kidneys and bowel			2
luckily , miss @entity6 is not yet affected to this extent but she does suffer from ulcers , which build up on her fingers and toes			1
changes in temperature set off her symptoms and something as simple as a cool breeze or air conditioning can affect her			0
‘ i live in gloves and ugg boots , and when i leave the house i look like an @entity141 , all year round , ’ she said at her home in @entity136 , @entity137			2
‘ i ca n’t walk in proper shoes any more , but i have to be thankful for the things i do have			0
’ the severity of the illness meant she had to give up work in 2004 and she now spends as much time as she can working as a volunteer with the @entity149			0
she relishes the chance to help other patients understand the condition , manage it properly and live life to the full			0
‘ there is n’t enough awareness out there , even among the medical profession – many gps do n’t know anything about it , ’ she said			0
‘ i ca n’t live the life i used to but i have to look at the positives and hope that one day i will wake up and jump out of bed			2
