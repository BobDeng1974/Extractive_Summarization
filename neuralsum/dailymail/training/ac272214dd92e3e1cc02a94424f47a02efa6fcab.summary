by @entity0 published : 03:26 est , 29 november 2012 @entity2 : 03:23 est , 30 november 2012 a judge questioned ' which genius ' had decided to charge a man who was spotted holding a kitchen knife when guarding his home from a gang of yobs			2
@entity10 , 44 , was woken up by ' rowdy ' drunk youths who were shouting outside his @entity13 home in august and shouted down asking the group to be quiet with the gang shouted back			1
the yobs went away but returned later and started banging on his door brandishing metal objects			1
@entity20 where a judge questioned the wisdom of @entity10 being on trial for taking a knife to protect his home from a gang mr @entity10 came to the door with a kitchen knife , police were called and he was arrested for possessing a bladed article			1
none of the gang of yobs were detained by police			0
judge @entity33 , @entity34 , asked whether @entity10 should be in court when none of the people who came to his door had been arrested			1
he gave him a conditional discharge , meaning he will face no punishment for the charge			1
describing @entity10 as of ' good character ' , he added : ' which genius thought it was in the public interest to prosecute this defendant ? ' @entity45 , prosecuting , said that mr @entity10 had been asleep at about 11.30pm when he was woken by the group 's shouts outside his home in the @entity50 area of the city			2
he added that the gang were ' rowdy and clearly in drink ' and said that they ' came back with metal implements and were banging on his door ' when he came to the door with the knife			1
@entity57 , defending , said his client admitted possession of a bladed article to avoid the stress of a trial and simply wanted the matter to end			0
after the hearing mr @entity10 said : ' i was a little bit rankled because of the aggression i received , but i should n't have done that , it was a bad decision			2
' charged : mr @entity10 was arrested by @entity69 following the incident he said he did not believe any of the people who banged on his door had been prosecuted and added : ' i was a little bit disappointed by that because you wonder whether they will go on to do something else			2
' a spokesman for the @entity79 said : ' when this case was charged , a prosecutor , as in all cases , considered the evidence in the case and the public interest			0
' the evidence provided showed that the defendant had left his apartment building carrying a large kitchen knife with the intention of making a group of youths who were causing a disturbance leave the vicinity			0
' the prosecutor took the view that going out in public with a knife can often inflame a situation , rather than resolve it			0
' the defendant pleaded guilty to this offence , on the basis that he had the knife in his hand because he had been cooking and had gone outside out of fear for himself and other residents in the block			0
' this plea was accepted by the prosecution			0
