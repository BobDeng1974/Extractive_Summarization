@entity1 manager @entity0 will allow striker @entity2 to return to @entity3 in order to kickstart a career that has so far failed to live up to its early hype			1
@entity10 and @entity11 are among several @entity13 clubs who have enquired about the 22 - year - old @entity15 , above , whose only first - team appearance for @entity1 came in a @entity17 tie against @entity18 in 2010			2
@entity2 secured @entity20 experience for @entity21 last season , but failed to sparkle on a loan move			0
outcast : @entity2 could be set for a return to @entity3 after failing to impress at @entity1 finding his feet : @entity2 shone in @entity3 with @entity10 , but has n't kicked on since with @entity27 and @entity28 absent in pre-season , @entity2 has had another chance to shine			1
but when the duo return it is expected he will be out in the cold again and swiftly moved on .			0

@entity2 *enjoyed* last spell in @entity3 with @entity10 , @entity11 now *interested*
*barely* featured for @entity1 in *recent* years , failed to impress at @entity21
has featured on pre-season tour because of *injuries* to @entity27 and @entity28
