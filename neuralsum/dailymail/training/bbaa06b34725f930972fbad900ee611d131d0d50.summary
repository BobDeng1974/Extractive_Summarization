shock : @entity1 announced on tuesday that @entity2 , pictured here in 2007 at the @entity4 , is publishing a book she set aside some 50 years ago @entity2 is blind , deaf and largely confined to a wheelchair , so how did the legendary to kill a mockingbird author suddenly okay a new book for publication over 55 years after she wrote it ? that 's the question on the minds of her neighbors in tiny @entity15 , @entity16 and fans alike now that @entity19 's publisher has revealed they 've had zero conversations with her about the mysterious new book @entity22			1
the undoubtedly massive deal was revealed just three months after the death of @entity19 's fiercely protective attorney sister by her literary agent and sister 's successor			1
that sister , @entity29 , who died in november at 103 , told a reporter before her death that her sister -- who had a stroke in 2007 -- ' ca n't see and ca n't hear and will sign anything put before her by anyone in whom she has confidence			1
' @entity2 publisher @entity37 acknowledged tuesday that the publisher has had no direct conversations about the new book with @entity2 , but communicated through her @entity15 attorney , @entity43 , and literary agent @entity44			1
the publisher says @entity46 came upon the manuscript at a ' secure location where it had been affixed to an original typescript of to kill a mockingbird			2
@entity37 said during a telephone interview that he had known both @entity46 and @entity53 for years and was ' completely confident ' @entity19 was fully involved in the decision to release the book			1
' we 've had a great deal of communication with @entity44 and @entity43 , ' said @entity37 , adding that @entity53 had met with her recently and found her ' feisty and in very fine spirits			1
' but , per the @entity61 , @entity44 also described @entity19 as ' a bit diffident at first and said , is this really worth publishing right now ? ' as she voiced to him her reservations about the new book			1
in the small @entity16 town @entity19 made famous with to kill a mockingbird , the @entity70 classic novel can be seen and felt everywhere			1
signs in @entity15 are decorated with mockingbirds			0
the old courthouse , a model for the movie version of the book , is now a museum that sells souvenirs including coffee cups , aprons and @entity83 ornaments			0
a statue in the town square and a mural decorating the side of a building depict characters who inhabited a fictional version of the town @entity19 called ' @entity92 , @entity16			2
the publisher dealt only with the disabled 88 - year - old 's literary agent @entity103 ( left with @entity105 of @entity106 ) and new attorney @entity43 @entity2 spent most of her life avoiding the spotlight following the massive success of he first and only novel to kill a mockingbird			1
so , less than three months since the death of her sharp - as - a - tack lifelong confidante sister @entity116 , should the public be suspicious of news the recluse is suddenly releasing a novel she penned in the 1950s ? the 88 - year - old author has reportedly been in ill health since 2007 , when she suffered a stroke that left her wheelchair - bound , nearly deaf and blind and unable to live on her own			1
protector : @entity2 's older sister @entity116 ran the family law firm for some 40 years before finally retiring at 100 , having remained all that time her sister 's staunch defender and protector @entity19 is now represented by @entity43 , who succeeded @entity116 in the family firm			1
according to @entity131 , ' @entity19 has a history of signing whatever 's put in front of her , apparently sometimes with @entity46 's advice			1
' @entity46 has a history of going after apparent infringements of copyrights held by @entity19 , even once going after a business owner in @entity19 's beloved hometown of @entity15 , @entity16 who was selling merchandise that capitalized on her name and that of her novel			1
@entity29 , who spent decades protecting her little sister from the spotlight , died last year at the age of 103			1
with a new @entity2 book being released just months after her attorney sister ( pictured ) @entity116 's death , some are questioning whether the publication is the wish of @entity2 -- who 's been nearly deaf and blind since a stroke left her wheelchair - bound in 2007 -- or of someone else so when it was announced she had another book to be released this summer , @entity15 residents and visitors alike were pleased and excited â€” but they were also perplexed			1
the first book centered on small - town attorney @entity164 , his children @entity166 and @entity168 , and racial injustice in the @entity170			2
the new book , ' @entity22 , ' is described as a sequel that @entity19 actually wrote in the 1950s before ' to kill a mockingbird			1
' one of the most beloved novels in history , @entity19 's original novel has sold over 40 million copies			1
but it was written after the upcoming book ' i was really surprised , ' said @entity181 , 28 , who owns a business in the town square			0
' you know there 's a lot of controversy about whether @entity2 actually wrote the ( first ) book			2
there 's been so many years in between , and you have to wonder , ' how did somebody forget about a book ? '' located halfway between @entity193 and @entity194 , @entity15 calls itself the ' @entity195 of @entity16 , ' a designation bestowed by the state legislature in the late 1990s			2
besides @entity19 , the city was home to novelist @entity200 and @entity202 - winning editorialist @entity201			2
for years , the town of 6,300 was known as the home of a huge @entity206 mill and outlet , but the factory shut down nearly 20 years ago			1
that left @entity15 with ' mockingbird ' and its literary heritage to attract visitors off the nearest highway , @entity214 65 , about 25 miles away			2
the nonprofit @entity215 opens the old courthouse to visitors and features a display about @entity19 's life in her own words			1
fans can sit in the courtroom balcony depicted in the @entity225 - winning screen version of the book			2
area residents put on a play based on the book each spring , holding the first act of sold - out performances on the courthouse lawn , then taking patrons inside for the climactic courtroom scenes			1
while visitors are few in shops right now , they 'll return once winter is over			0
' it will be busy again during the play , ' @entity181 said			0
visitors likely wo n't see the 88 - year - old @entity19 , who lived in @entity239 for years but now resides in an assisted living center not far from where she grew up			1
a longtime friend said she is deaf , blind and in poor health , spending much of her time in a wheelchair			2
she was last seen publicly in november at the funeral of her older sister , @entity29 , who long represented the author and was known for being protective of her			0
mystery : the sudden announcement of a new book from @entity2 ( left in 2007 and right circa 1960 ) has fans thrilled but confused			1
the reclusive writer fiercely avoided the spotlight for 55 years but now , aged 88 and in poor health , has signed off on publishing the book from which @entity256 originally spun off some ' @entity256 ' fans encountered in @entity15 on tuesday said they are excited by the news of a new book			2
' i bet it 's going to be great			0
the first one was , ' said @entity263 , of nearby @entity264			0
@entity265 said she ca n't wait to read ' go set a @entity266 , ' which publisher @entity2 said will be released july 14			1
@entity267 , who lives in @entity268 , is among the tourists who have been lured to @entity15 by ' mockingbird			0
' in the middle of her second trip to town when the publisher announced @entity19 's new novel , @entity267 got goose bumps			1
' i 'm just absolutely shaking , ' she said			0
worldwide sales of ' @entity92 ' have topped 40 million copies since its release in july 1960			0
although occasionally banned over the years because of its language and racial themes , ' @entity92 ' has become a standard for reading clubs and middle and high schools			0
the movie version of ' @entity92 ' is the rare adaptation as beloved as its source material			0
so when @entity2 and her publisher announced tuesday that this summer they 'll release the 88 - year - old author 's second book , ' @entity294 , ' a kind of sequel to ' @entity92 , ' the shockwaves were felt almost as much in @entity297 as they were in the book world			1
the movies , after all , love a sequel			0
and rare is the chance to follow up one of the most iconic @entity304 films , half a century later			0
a new instant classic ? @entity306 is shown as attorney @entity164 , a small - town @entity70 lawyer who defends a black man accused of rape , in a scene from to kill a @entity256 if @entity19 agrees to sell the movie rights of her new book , it can be expected to be one of the most eagerly sought novels for optioning to the big screen			1
particularly since @entity19 said tuesday that ' @entity319 ' follows her young heroine , @entity166 , into adulthood , it 's sure to be feverishly pursued by producers			2
it 's likely to spark a bidding war well before it lands on book shelves july 14			2
such an opportunity could draw in a host of high - profile producers			0
@entity331 , for one , has called ' @entity92 ' her favorite book			0
( in a statement tuesday , she said : ' i could n't be happier if my name was scout			0
' ) starring @entity306 and featuring a young @entity336 as @entity337 , ' @entity92 ' has regularly been ranked among the greatest @entity304 movies			0
it won three @entity225 , including best actor for @entity306 and best - adapted screenplay for @entity342			0
in 1995 , it was added to the @entity344 , and in 2003 the @entity345 listed @entity306 's @entity164 as the greatest movie hero of the 20th century			0
' congratulations to @entity2 , ' @entity336 staid in a statement tuesday			0
' i am looking forward to reading the book			0
the film was a pivotal point in my career and we all have been waiting for the second book			0
' @entity355 , who was @entity225 nominated at age 10 for her performance as @entity166 , only acted in a handful of films and tv shows after ' to kill a mockingbird			2
' almost 40 years after her last film , she came out of retirement to appear in the 2005 indie drama ' @entity365			0
' @entity355 did n't respond to requests for comment tuesday .			0

@entity239 - based @entity369 said they 've dealt only with the 88 - year - old to kill a mockingbird legend 's attorney and book agent
the surprise announcement came just three months after @entity19 's fierce defender sister @entity116 , an attorney , died at 103
@entity116 's successor at the family firm @entity43 is now the attorney for @entity19 , who had a stroke that left her largely deaf and blind in 2007
@entity116 revealed before her death that her sister ' ca n't see and ca n't hear and will sign anything put before her by anyone in whom she has confidence '
