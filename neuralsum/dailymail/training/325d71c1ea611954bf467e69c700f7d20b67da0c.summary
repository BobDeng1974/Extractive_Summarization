one college – which officials have refused to name – has had all its funding stopped while an investigation is carried out			0
experts also raised fears that @entity7 and @entity8 students could make cash in hand at the expense of the taxpayer while studying for these courses , which officials admit have less stringent entrance criteria			1

but from january 1 they will have full rights to live and work here when @entity32 controls expire			0
overall , numbers enrolling for higher national diplomas ( @entity58 ) and certificates ( @entity60 ) have more than doubled from 13,000 to 30,000 in only 12 months			1

details of the problem emerged in a letter from chief executive of the @entity116 , @entity117 , to a senior official at the @entity119			0
he said : ' there may be legitimate reasons for this [ surge ] but as the weaknesses identified in the residency check process for @entity7 and @entity8 students may also be exploited by students from other @entity129 nations , these numbers are cause for concern			2
' professor @entity133 , director of the @entity134 at the @entity135 , said the courses provide a convenient route to government funding , adding : ' the students could be working in the black economy because the courses are not as demanding as degrees			2
' sir @entity143 , chairman of @entity144 said : ' this is a remarkably large number			2
it must surely be an indication of the kind of immigration pressures that we will face from these two countries			0
' in a written statement to @entity152 yesterday , universities minister @entity2 said : ' we identified that there had been a significant increase in the number of @entity8 and @entity7 students applying for full student support in @entity18 this year			1
