with arms opened wide and a slight hint of a frown , the leader of this group of raccoons seems to be warning their saviours to keep back as they are rescued after an overnight stay in a dumpster			0
but the raccoon behind him is n't quite so confident , putting its paws protectively around a smaller raccoon as it inspects the human who will get them out			0
these adorable photos were taken in @entity16 , @entity17 , after resident @entity18 went to take the rubbish out with her boyfriend			1
the raccoons had got themselves trapped overnight while foraging for food in the large green bin , but were not at all sure about the people who wanted to help them out			2
ms @entity18 and her boyfriend @entity38 made a ramp for the notoriously shy creatures out of cardboard and retreated to give the animals the confidence to come out			2
the raccoons emerged blinking in the morning sunshine and then fled , probably to the next garbage bin			0
dumpsters are a popular source of food for raccoons , who tend not to think before they leap , and who are usually able to climb onto rubbish to get out once they have eaten enough			1
but when the dumpster has recently been emptied , as this one had , there is nothing to climb onto - let alone eat - and the scavengers are stuck until a kind - hearted human comes and helps them out			0
raccoons are shy but clever - studies have shown they learn which night trash is put out in a neighbourhood now how do we get down ? the raccoons climbed up a cardboard ramp to get out of the @entity16 dumpster let 's go the back way : the hungry animals worked out the best way to get down after being helped out			1

hungry raccoons had not looked before they leapt into bin in @entity16 , @entity17
they were discovered by @entity18 when she took the trash out
raccoons get stuck in dumpsters when there 's no rubbish to climb onto
