by @entity0 for @entity1 running a marathon is a momentous effort for most people - a once - in - a - lifetime event to tick off the bucket list			2
but for @entity8 , 31 , from @entity9 , south @entity10 , it 's a daily occurrence			1
he gets up at 2.45am every morning to run a whole marathon course around @entity12 before he starts his working day as the manager of a specialist car parts company			1
what makes this all the more impressive is that @entity8 has had to overcome an incredibly abusive childhood with a father who beat him regularly , followed by a period in care homes , in order to get to this place			1
@entity8 taking part in one of his 367 marathons planned for this year until the age of six , @entity8 lived in @entity28 with his mother and sister under his father 's reign of terror - not even the family dog was safe from the daily violent outbursts , which saw his sister sexually abused and him thrown down stairs in a suitcase			1
he said : ' as a young child i was witness to some terrible things , which most people would find hard to imagine or understand			0
' i was beaten pretty much every day , with anything that easily came to my father 's hand			2
' it could be a slipper , a stick or a plank of wood , today i still have quite a number of scars on my body from these beatings			0
' sometimes my father would zip me into a suitcase and push me down the stairs , this was one of the milder things i had to endure , though			0
' the worst thing was being dangled over the banister at the top of the stairs by one leg - he used to tell me that if i made any noise at all or if i cried he would drop me			0
' the breaking point came one evening when @entity8 was six years old - his father returned home and started a bout of violence that ended with @entity8 being hung with a rope			1
he said : ' he tied a rope around my neck from which he hung me on an old - fashioned coat hanger near the front door			0
happily ever after : @entity8 now lives in @entity9 , south @entity10 , with his fiancée @entity76 , 26 , and son @entity77 , 21 months ' i remember the feeling of having no air to breathe and i struggled as my father held my legs , it became very scary until he decided to let me down			1
' @entity8 's mother decided that enough was enough and fled the family home with her two children in tow			1
sadly , she was unable to care for them and while @entity8 's sister was sent to live with an aunt , he was put in a care home			1
what followed was an incredibly tough few years , as he struggled to make his voice heard among hundreds of other lost children while being passed from care home to care home			0
@entity8 said : ' that was very difficult , because i was lumped in there with a lot of other children , very troubled children who were often a lot older than me , who bullied each other and who are from very disruptive backgrounds			1
' the people who work in these places often do n’t know how to cope and many also just see it as a job			2
' the reason that a lot of these children behave the way they do is because the only way to get attention is by acting up - by getting into trouble - that ’s the only way anyone will ever notice you			0
@entity8 runs a marathon every day and takes part in group marathons most weekends ' i was like that too for a while , but then i remember the moment that i switched – i must have been about eight or nine years old and someone said to me : " you ’re going to turn out just like your dad			1
" ' it was like a switch flipped in my head , i thought : " i ’m not going to be like him , i ’m never going to end up like that			0
" ' from then on i just decided to throw myself into school and sport			0
' around that time i had just started going to school properly , i had n't been sent that often until then , and i really enjoyed all of the sports lessons			0
' the real moment of change in @entity8 's life came when he was around 11 years old and he was fostered by the deputy headmaster of a top private school			1
from that day , he was given a second chance at life - learning behavioural and academic skills that would help him to pave his way through life			2
he said : ' when i was in year seven , this wonderful man – a head teacher of a private school - came and took me in			0
' he totally changed my life			0
' he taught me everything ; from how to set a table , to how to eat a six - course meal , to holding an adult conversation and helped me to get all of my exams , which include good gcses and a-levels			0
@entity8 decided to try and run 367 marathons in 365 days while watching television with his with his fiancée @entity76 one evening earlier this year - he had never run a marathon until then ' i think of him as my real father			1
' ' to this day i believe he enabled me to be the person i am today - all my best aspects derived from his tutorage			2
' fast - forward more than a decade and @entity8 lives in @entity9 with his fiancée @entity76 , 26 , and his son @entity77 , 21 months			1
he also has a five - year - old daughter called @entity168 from a previous relationship			0
after landing on his feet , the 31 - year - old made a decision earlier this year to give something back to children who find themselves in the situation he was once in			2
while watching television with @entity76 one evening , @entity8 decided to take on the humongous challenge of completing 367 marathons in 365 days			1
so every morning he gets out of bed at 2.45am and heads down to the marathon track at @entity9 park to run 26.2 miles before heading back home to shower and change before work			1
and although many would struggle to find any silver lining in waking before dawn to run such a long way , unlike the rest of us , @entity8 can eat what he wants , whenever he wants			1
@entity8 takes part in so many marathons these days that he has spare energy that he uses to sing and encourage fellow runners he said : ' people tell me that i should probably start eating a certain diet - really healthy food , but to be honest , eating what i fancy has worked for me so far			2
' i just eat anything i can get my hands on really - i really like chocolate eclairs , i love @entity202 , cakes , biscuits , lots of pasta , i ’ll have anything really			0
' i eat my recommended 2,500 calories a day and then i also have the 4,000 calories that you should eat when doing a marathon			2
' and the most galling part for anybody who as ever limped through a marathon , wondering if they 'll ever manage to make the finishing line , is that @entity8 quite literally takes them in his stride these days			1
he said : ' they say that you have to slow down your time drastically if you are doing back - to - back marathons , so i have slowed my time to four hours			0
' but four hours means that i am pretty much walking over the finish line and can go and play a game of football straight afterwards			0
@entity8 credits his 21 - month - old son @entity225 with helping to inspire him on the early mornings ' i take part in official marathons regularly as well as doing the @entity9 course and i like to sing and dance to encourage other marathon runners when i ’m doing those , because that keeps spirits up when people are flagging			1
' i also pick up a few bottles of water at the water stations and then carry them round to other runners			0
' and while @entity8 is planning on slowing down the number of marathons he takes part in once he reaches his 367 mark , he has also jokingly tried to convince his fiancée that they should get married during one			2
he said : ' i did suggest to my partner that we should get married and then run a marathon , then everyone from the wedding party could run with us and we could stop for a drink and photos at the different drinks stations and have a party afterwards			2
' but saving that , his main aim is just to raise as much money as possible for charity			0
he said : ' if i can help young people in similar situations and encourage them to make peace with their pasts , then i feel something good has come out of all i have had to endure			0
' @entity263 @entity8 is running a marathon a day for a year to raise money for the @entity266 and @entity267			1

@entity8 , 31 , gets up at 2.45am every day to run a marathon before work
he is *hoping* to raise *£* *100,000* for the @entity266 and @entity267
