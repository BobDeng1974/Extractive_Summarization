a rescue @entity0 named @entity2 is so afraid that she will be abandoned again that she ca n't bear to eat alone			1
in an adorable video posted to @entity6 by user @entity7 with nearly one million views , puppy @entity3 can be seen lifting her dish to bring it over to her canine friend @entity10 who is also scarfing down a meal			1
@entity3 lifts the dish into her mouth and scuttles her paws backwards to dine along with @entity10			0
given a dish : @entity2 's new owner feeds her a dish of food away from his other dog @entity10 @entity10 continues to focus on his plate and is n't bothered by his new company and from the sound of their names , it sounds like they might become partners in crime - or ' pawtners ' in dog speak			0
@entity31 was rescued from @entity32 and is a @entity0 , which means mixed breed or street dog			1
due to extreme poverty , the streets of @entity32 are overwrought with thousands of abandoned dogs			2
luckily for @entity3 she 's no longer one of them , she 'll have food on her plate , and she wo n't have to eat alone ever again			0
wait for me ! : @entity3 is so afraid to eat alone that she grabs her dish and paws her way over to @entity10 that 's better ! : @entity3 and @entity10 eat together and it seems as though the two dogs may become partners in crime for life			0
