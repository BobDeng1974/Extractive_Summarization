by @entity1 reporter published : 17:32 est , 7 july 2013 updated : 07:15 est , 8 july 2013 you will go to the ball : @entity4 prepares for the prom at her school with her new prosthetic leg when @entity9 took the agonising decision to have a leg amputated , the teenager was determined to lead a normal life			1
but there was one ambition that the 15 - year - old ’s new limb seemed destined to thwart			1
@entity4 had her heart set on dressing up and attending her school prom			1
however , her @entity20 prosthetic leg made dancing difficult and wearing high heels impossible			1
then she heard about an artificial leg designed to fit heeled shoes – and her parents @entity25 and @entity26 began a fundraising campaign to buy her one in time for the prom			1
the £ 5,600 leg meant @entity4 was able to attend the leavers ’ ball at @entity33 in @entity34 last week wearing sparkly silver 3.5in heels and a flowing red dress – and could enjoy dancing with her friends			1
‘ everyone was so surprised at how real it looked , ’ she said			0
‘ going to the prom was brilliant , it felt great to go all glammed up and look girlie because at parties everyone can normally wear heels but i have to wear flat shoes			2
‘ the whole thing was just completely new to me			0
i have never worn heels before			0
‘ @entity48 was much easier with a heeled foot because with a flat one you do n’t have the right sort of balance			0
‘ the only problem i had was with my other leg , as my foot started to ache			0
’ @entity4 was 18 months old when she was diagnosed with a rare congenital disease that caused her right shinbone to be weak and fracture			0
night on the tiles : @entity9 with her friends on the way to the prom at their school years of operations failed to cure the condition , which meant her right leg was 3in shorter than the left			2
twelve months ago , she decided to have the leg amputated below the knee and was fitted with a conventional @entity20 prosthetic limb with a foot position that limited her to wearing flat shoes			2
‘ before the amputation i was wearing a metal leg frame constantly and had to tighten pins to make [ my leg ] grow , ’ said @entity4			2
‘ i could only wear skirts or shorts and i could n’t even wear a pair of jeans			0
proud parents : @entity4 with her dad @entity26 and mum @entity25 who raised money for their daughter 's new leg @entity9 and her prosthetic leg ( left ) which has meant she can wear heels to the prom @entity9 took the agonising decision to have a leg amputated but she wants to lead a normal life ‘ i spoke to my family about the decision to have it amputated and i decided to go for it and have n’t looked back since			1
’ her mother , a 47 - year - old customer service assistant , said : ‘ the @entity20 leg is great but they just do n’t have the money for the cosmetic side of things that a 15 - year - old girl in this position needs			1
’ she and her husband , a 46 - year - old firefighter , raised the money for the leg to be fitted at a private clinic , @entity105 in @entity106 , @entity107			1
determined : @entity9 attaches her prosthetic leg ( left ) and without it ( right ) experts took a cast of her left calf so they could sculpt the acrylic leg to look as natural as possible , and even colour - matched the silicone coating to her skin			1
@entity116 , a prosthetist at the clinic , said : ‘ it looks unbelievably real and that was one of the main things @entity4 wanted as well as having the chance to wear a heel			2
‘ heeled prosthetic legs can be designed to be at a range of heights and myself and @entity126 worked out the most suitable height for her			0
’ mrs @entity9 said : ‘ the high - heeled leg is absolutely amazing			0
@entity4 can now go shopping for the shoes she wants to wear , not what she has to wear			0
‘ it ’s so nice that she can now wear pretty shoes , she looked absolutely stunning at her prom and it has given her a real confidence boost			0

@entity4 had her heart set on dressing up and attending her school prom
her prosthetic leg made dancing and wearing high heels impossible
the 15 - year - old was fitted with a new artificial leg costing £ 5,600 which means she could wear high heels to the prom
