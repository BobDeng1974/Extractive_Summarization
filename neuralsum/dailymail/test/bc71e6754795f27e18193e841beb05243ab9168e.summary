right from the moment he breezed through the doors at @entity3 , @entity4 was a man with a plan			0
the first season , he stated , would see him deliver @entity7 back into their rightful place in the @entity9			1
he would restore them to the @entity12 top four but loftier aims of silverware would have to wait			0
his three - year vision would allow for such thoughts but , first things first , @entity7 needed to be dining from @entity20 football 's top table again			1
@entity4 is close to delivering his first - season aim of returning @entity7 into @entity9 @entity22 smashes home during @entity7 's 3 - 1 win over @entity25 on saturday @entity7 's win over @entity25 took them third , eight points ahead of fifth - placed @entity28 in the table april 12 @entity30 ( @entity31 ) april 18 @entity32 ( a ) april 26 @entity33 ( a ) may 2 @entity34 ( @entity31 ) may 9 @entity35 ( a ) may 17 @entity36 ( @entity31 ) may 24 @entity37 ( a ) one season out of the @entity9 was far from ideal , but two seasons would be an absolute disaster and something , he understood , that would not be tolerated			1
in november , even that was looking optimistic			0
a 1 - 0 defeat to @entity30 meant that @entity7 had taken just 13 points from their opening 10 matches - it was their worst start to a league campaign since 1986 , when @entity50 only lasted until november			2
they had also been humiliated in the @entity51 by @entity53 side @entity52			0
once again , with a more than a hint of desperation , @entity54 reminded everyone after the derby defeat that this was a long - term project			2
' it 's not good enough , ' he said			0
' but on the other hand , we are in a process , as i have said from the beginning			0
the process shall take more than one year , it shall take three years			0
' suddenly , it seemed like @entity54 was shifting the goalposts			2
instead of finishing top four in his first season , was he now suggesting that @entity7 might only be worthy of those positions by year three ? that did n't sound good			1
it took some time for @entity7 to hit their stride under @entity54 but things have finally come together @entity7 were again at their best in saturday 's 3 - 1 home win over @entity25 , which took them third @entity7 celebrate their title triumph in 2013 - @entity54 's aim is to return such success to @entity3 but @entity54 has been true to his word			1
barring a catastrophic late collapse in form , @entity7 will be gracing the @entity9 again next season			1
with an eight - point cushion established over @entity28 in fifth , @entity7 's faithful can look forward to those electric @entity20 nights against next season			1
their failure to qualify for the continent 's premier club competition this year is a mere blip , rather than a symbol of sustained decline			0
with matches against @entity32 , @entity36 and @entity30 still to come , there is even far - fetched talk of @entity7 winning the title			1
now that really would be an acceleration of the @entity54 masterplan			0
that wo n't happen but there 's no reason why @entity7 ca n't finish second or third , avoiding the necessity of a potentially tricky @entity9 qualifier in august			1
@entity7 are on course , the plan is on track and @entity54 can be satisfied			2
there are growing signs too that @entity54 's team are looking like the @entity7 of old			2
@entity112 scored twice in @entity7 's 3 - 1 win over @entity25 at the weekend @entity114 , who scored twice in the 2 - 1 win over @entity28 , has been excellent under @entity54 @entity116 ( right ) has been mainly playing from the bench during @entity7 's recent good run of form @entity120 ( right ) has also had to be content with a place on the bench the 3 - 1 win over @entity25 on saturday was another indication that @entity7 are now a settled side			1
the fluent , possession - based football and the waves of attack that were hallmarks of the @entity131 era are slowly beginning to return			0
@entity54 , after trying what seems like a million combinations , has found the shape and system that best makes use of the resources at his disposal			0
it seems to exclude @entity116 and @entity120 - combined value Â£ 103.5m - but while the money men wo n't be happy , everyone else is			0
now that @entity7 have manoeuvred themselves into a strong position in the top four , @entity54 can regard his first season in @entity146 football as a job well done			1
but year two demands further improvement			0
@entity7 must mount a sustained challenge for the @entity12 title and reach the later stages of the @entity9			1
now we wait and see if @entity54 can deliver .			2

@entity7 have an eight - point cushion from fifth - place @entity28
@entity54 looks likely to deliver on his *promise* of top four finish
but the @entity161 has a three - year vision *mapped* out
next season will have to see @entity7 mount sustained challenge for title
they must also reach the later stages of the @entity9
