by @entity0 a @entity2 schoolgirl is battling one of the world ’s rarest diseases which attack every organ in her body on a daily basis			2
@entity9 , aged seven , suffers from @entity11 syndrome , a genetic disorder which has seen her become close to blind - deaf and suffer from kidney failure and dilated cardiomyopathy as well as a series of other debilitating illnesses			1
@entity11 is so rare that @entity9 , from @entity17 , @entity18 , is just one of 60 sufferers in the @entity2 , and one of 266 cases worldwide			1
the odds of inheriting the disease are just over a million to one			2
brave : @entity9 , seven , from @entity17 , @entity18 , has genetic disorder @entity11 syndrome , an illness which causes multi-organ dysfunction although @entity9 still attends school four days a week , and loves practicing swimming and judo , her parents know that she will inevitable need an organ transplant in the future			1
her mother @entity35 said her and her businessman husband @entity36 first noticed symptoms when @entity9 developed a strange sensitivity to light			1
after numerous several doctors ’ appointments the couple were given the grave news she was suffering from @entity11 syndrome			1
the disorder is inherited which means both @entity35 and @entity36 will have carried the faulty genes without being affected themselves			2
@entity49 is a very rare recessively inherited genetic disorder			1
both parents have to carry the gene mutation for the child to be affected and the disease can make itself known in the first weeks of a child 's life			0
in nearly all cases , children suffer progressive loss of sight and hearing , obesity and insulin resistance , photophobia and nystagmus			0
it is also common to suffer from liver and kidney failure , type 2 diabetes , cardiomyopathy and bladder and bowl problems			2
ms @entity9 , 41 , who is now her daughter ’s full - time carer and a volunteer for the national charity @entity49 @entity2 , said the diagnosis was ‘ devastating			2
’ she said : ‘ @entity11 syndrome affects all the organs in the body			1
it was such a shock to be told and when i read the signs and prognosis it was just horrific			0
‘ the chances of getting it are a million to one and only 60 people have been officially diagnosed with it in the @entity2			0
‘ i remember thinking , ‘ would n’t it be horrific if she lost her sight ’ but now it ’s the life - threatening problems like heart failure which are scary			0
’ first described by @entity92 in @entity93 in 1959 , @entity11 syndrome is a result of 79 possible mutations in the gene @entity95			1
tragedy : @entity9 , pictured with her mother @entity35 and family friend @entity99 who is running the @entity100 to raise money for @entity9 , is almost blind , nearly deaf and has severe kidney problems the earliest symptoms include childhood obesity , blindness due to congenital retinal dystrophy , hearing loss and photophobia ( sensitivity to light )			1
sufferers often develop early - onset type 2 diabetes , renal and hepatic dysfunction affecting the liver and kidneys , bladder and bowel problems , and cardiomyopathy , where the heart is weakened and enlarged			1
future prospects : as her condition worsens , @entity123 family knows she may need a heart transplant as well as other organs it ’s likely that @entity9 will eventually need a heart transplant to survive and will have a reduced life expectancy			2
@entity35 said : ‘ @entity130 is a massive worry and when she needs the transplant			0
' will there be one there and will anyone be kind enough to donate their loved one ’s organs ? ‘ i just hope that medical advances will improve and her chances of surviving will be better			0
‘ she is just the most loving little girl and she will give anything a go			0
' she knows what ’s wrong and we do n’t hide it from her			0
‘ we try and do everything that you would do with a normal child			0
‘ her life may not be as long as we were expecting or would want it to be , and we just do n’t know what her life expectancy will be , but we appreciate every minute with her and she has taught us to live like that			0
‘ she just brings so much to my life			0
she is wonderful and if i had the choice not to have her at all or to have her with @entity11 syndrome i would have chosen her every time			1
’ alstrom syndrome @entity2 is run by volunteers like @entity35 and every donation goes to researching the rare disorder			2
family friend @entity99 is running the @entity100 to help raise money and awareness of @entity11 syndrome , click here for his @entity165 page			1
