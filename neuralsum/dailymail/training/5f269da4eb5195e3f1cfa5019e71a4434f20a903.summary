after it was done , the hospital that performed all the procedures against his will even billed him - and threatened to hire a collections agency if he did n't pay , he alleges			1

when he stood , an officer claims , he was clenching the cheeks of his buttocks - which the officer believed was a sign he was hiding drugs			1
that single observation kicked off the horrific cavity searches that kept mr @entity6 in captivity for 14 hours			2
' if the officers in @entity48 and the @entity49 of @entity31 are seeking warrants for anal cavity searches based on how they 're standing and the warrant allows doctors at the @entity54 to go in and do enemas and colonoscopies without consent , then anyone can be seized and that 's why the public needs to know about this , ' mr @entity6 's lawyer , civil rights attorney @entity45 , told the tv station			1
