more than 800 million men living today are descended from just eleven men , including the ruthless @entity3 leader @entity2 , according to new research			1
geneticists have been able to find eleven distinctive sequences in y - chromosomes - the chunk of dna that is only carried by men - that are persistent in modern populations in @entity12			1
by systematically analysing the dna of more than 5,000 men , they have been able to trace these male lineages to their approximate ' founding fathers '			1
this map shows ten of the 11 lineages ( labelled @entity19 ) with the approximate date when they originated and how they appear to have spread around the continent			0
the arrows show how the lineage may have spread they found that along with @entity2 , who is reputed to have sired hundreds of children as his hoards cut a swathe across much of @entity12 , they traced ten other lineages			1
these are thought to originate from the @entity31 to @entity12 between @entity32 and @entity33			1
they found that 37.8 per cent of the 5,000 men they tested belonged to one of these eleven lineages			1
scientists are using space - age technology to help them find the final resting place of the first @entity3 emperor @entity2			1
although he ruled an empire that extended over most of @entity12 , the final resting place of the @entity44 leader remains a mystery			2
he died in 1227 at the age of 72 after a sudden illness			0
legend says that as his body was carried to its final resting place , anyone encountered along the route was put to the sword before those escorting the body also killed themselves , to keep its location a secret			0
researchers at the @entity61 have used crowdsourcing to scour more than 84,000 satellite images of a part of @entity3 where his body is suspected to be			2
by searching an area of 2,316 square miles , they have been able to identify 55 potential sites for where the great @entity44 warlords body may now lie			0
if this is reflected in the entire @entity72 population , then it could mean around 830 million men living in @entity12 currently owe their y - chromosomes to one of these eleven men			1
among them is a lineage that has previously been attributed to a @entity80 ruler called @entity81 , who died in 1583 and whose grandson founded the @entity83 that ruled @entity80 between 1644 and 1912			1
@entity81 is thought to have had many children with his wives and concubines and is the direct male ancestor of more than 1.5 million men			1
the researchers also found that another of the lineages appears to have population clusters that are concentrated along the @entity94 trading route and date back to around @entity95			2
this suggests they may have their origins among the powerful rulers who dominated the steppes where the route passed - the @entity102 , @entity103 , @entity104 , @entity105 and @entity44 empires			0
the researchers suggest that @entity106 , emperor @entity106 and the @entity107 of the @entity102 , who died in @entity108 in the @entity102 area of @entity80 , is a possible candidate for the father of this lineage			2
professor @entity112 , a geneticist at the @entity113 who led the work , which is published in the @entity115 , said that more research was needed before they could identify the individuals			2
the founding fathers who lived between @entity32 and @entity119 appear to have existed in both sedentary agricultural societies and nomadic tribes , he added			1
@entity2 is thought to have fathered hundreds of children as his armies conquered much of @entity12 while his sons also continued to spread his y - chromosome around the world as they expanded the @entity127 writing in the @entity128 , he said : ' high reproductive success is often associated with high social status , ‘ prestigious ’ men having higher intramarital fertility , lower offspring mortality and access to a greater than average number of wives			1
' those with recent origins in the historical period are almost exclusively found in @entity141 - speaking pastoral nomadic populations , which may reflect a shift in political organisation in pastoralist economies and a greater ease of transmission of y - chromosomes through time and space facilitated by the use of horses			2
' new social systems and economic adaptations emerged after horse domestication			0
' horse - riding greatly enhanced both east – west connections and north – south trade between @entity164 and southerly regions , and allowed new techniques of warfare , a key element explaining the successes of mobile pastoralists in their conflicts with more sedentary societies			2
' one of the male lineages that have come to dominate in @entity12 appears to have originated from one of the empires that sprung up along the @entity94 , depicted here in this @entity171 nautical map from 1325 - 1387 the researchers analysed the y chromosomes of 5,321 men from 127 different populations around @entity12			1
they found 11 common y chromosome sequences that cropped up repeatedly in the genomes they examined			0
by searching these for distinctive random mutations that accumulate over time they were able to estimate roughly when these y chromosome sequences originated			0
@entity81 , grandfather of the @entity83 ruler @entity182 ( above ) , is thought to be directly related to 1.5 million men now living in @entity80 and @entity3 looking at the distribution of these sequences in the populations they tested also allowed them to estimate where they may have originated by looking for clusters			1
previous research conducted in 2003 had shown that almost 16 million men across the world could be related to the @entity44 leader @entity2 , who died in 1227			1
scientists traced a cluster of extremely similar y - chromosomes back to a single ancestor living in @entity3 around 800 years ago			1
they believe the only man with the opportunity to father enough children would have been the @entity3 warlord			0
within 80 years he built an empire that covered much of @entity80 , @entity205 , @entity206 , @entity207 and @entity208			0
the empire he founded went on to stretch across much of @entity12 and into @entity210 , meaning there was potential for his descendants to spread his genes far and wide			2
@entity214 , an accountancy professor whose ancestors came from the @entity216 , was the first man outside @entity12 to be identified as carrying the @entity2 chromosome			1
it was found that professor @entity214 's paternal forebears came from the @entity220 near the @entity221			0
similar work found @entity81 was also the most probably origin of another distinct y chromosome found in modern @entity80 and @entity3			1
however , tracing the other dominant y chromosomes to other individuals will require similar educated guesswork by looking for men who had the power and potential to sire large numbers of children at around the right time that the sequences are found to originally occur			2
@entity2 was the founder and @entity107 of the @entity127			0
in the early 1200s he united the tribes , creating a military state that invaded its neighbours and expanded , soon ruling most of what would become modern @entity207 , @entity80 , @entity208 , eastern @entity210 , southeast @entity12 , @entity205 and @entity239			1
@entity2 made himself master of half the known world , and inspired mankind with a fear that lasted for generations			0
he was a prolific lover , fathering hundreds of children across his territories			0
some scientists think he has 16 million male descendants alive today			1
by the time he died in august 1227 , the @entity127 covered a vast part of @entity250 and @entity80			0
originally known as @entity252 , legend has it @entity2 was born holding a clot of blood in his hand			0
his father was @entity2 , or emperor , of a small tribe but was murdered when @entity252 was still young			0
the new tribal leader wanted nothing to do with @entity2 's family , so with his mother and five other children , @entity252 was cast out and left to die			2
in all , @entity2 conquered almost four times the lands of @entity266			0
he is still revered in @entity3 and in parts of @entity80			2
one of the ' founding fathers ' appears to have lived in what is now northern @entity270 in @entity271 while another came from @entity205 in around 1100ad			1
others seem to originate around @entity32 and @entity274 in southeast @entity12			0
around this time farming populations were moving down through @entity276 into @entity277 , @entity278 and @entity279 , leading to the @entity281 and @entity282 empires			0
the only way to know for sure who these 11 founding fathers were will be to find their remains and extract dna			1
if the tomb of leaders like @entity2 are ever unearthed , it could result in the ultimate paternity test for millions of men around the world			2
@entity294 , an evolutionary geneticist now at the @entity295 in @entity296 , @entity297 , who led that orginal study in 2003 , told nature : ' looking for these links is fascinating			0
' when we did it , we were using pretty indirect lines of reasoning , and you could try and do that with each of these lineages			0
' what i really hope is that at some point someone will find @entity2 's tomb and remains			0

scientists from the @entity113 traced dna in modern men to ' founding fathers ' that lived across @entity12 between @entity318 and @entity33
the geneticists traced each the eleven lineages back to their potential roots in the @entity31 , @entity239 , @entity80 , @entity3 and south east @entity12
they analysed y chromosomes from 5,000 men from 127 populations
16 million men are thought to be directly descended from @entity2
1.5 million are descended from 14th century @entity80 leader @entity81
