@entity0 gave manager @entity1 a timely reminder of what he is capable of as the misfiring @entity5 striker hit the target during an indoor training session , although it was only a bottle and not the net			1
the 24 - year - old has failed to impress for the @entity10 since his Â£ 16million move from @entity12 last summer , scoring just twice in all competitions - and still without a goal in the @entity15			2
such was his lack of form and playing time , the maverick @entity18 was linked with a move away from @entity20 in the recent transfer window , but a return to @entity23 failed to materialise			0
@entity0 gets hold of the ball prior to the target practice on tuesday the @entity5 striker strikes the ball cleanly with his right foot as the ball heads towards the bottle the ball lands straight on to the bottle as the @entity5 striker shows he still has got it but there is still room for optimism that @entity0 can turn his @entity5 career around , with the striker all smiles as he posted a video on @entity42 showing off his ball skills			0
@entity0 posted the message ' lol crazy easy ' accompanied with the video , as the former @entity12 striker accurately knocked over a plastic bottle from distance with a right - footed effort @entity0 will be hoping to strike up a partnership with fit - again @entity50 at the heart of the @entity5 attack , after the latter returned from a five - month lay off to score in a win against @entity55 last saturday			0
the 24 - year - old celebrates after effectively hitting the target - in this case a bottle the former @entity12 striker has failed to score a single @entity15 goal since arriving at @entity20 @entity0 's agent recently revealed the striker has been ' very disappointed ' with his time at @entity5			1

@entity0 is yet to score in the @entity15 for @entity5
however , the 24 - year - old showed manager @entity1 he is on the way back to hitting form as he hit the target in a indoor training session
