known locally as @entity0 , the @entity2 cul - de - sac of 11 white @entity4 houses with private beaches at the end of @entity8 promenade is a real - life version of the tv comedy @entity11			1
the sitcom featured impressionists playing celebrities such as @entity15 and @entity16 living as neighbours			1
but put the rubbish out here in @entity8 and you could be saying good morning to @entity29 and @entity31 - winning singer @entity30 , @entity23 comedian and novelist @entity22 , dj @entity25 and his @entity18 wife @entity19 , and former eastenders and heartbeat star @entity21			1
the homes were built between 1909 and 1910 by developer @entity42 when overcrowding on @entity45 beaches in their heyday meant that a home with a private beach was the last word in luxury			1
and that still seems to be true			2
with celebrities occupying six of the properties – @entity25 and his wife have three , two for them and one for relatives – that leaves just five other houses			1
and in a rare event , one of those has just come on the market , for a guide price of £ 4 million			1
approached from the back , the cul - de - sac does not look anything special , tucked away behind the warehouses of the working port of @entity70			2
but sitting in the lounge of @entity74 ’s splendid home on a sunny day , with the sea seemingly lapping at the floor - to - ceiling windows , you could be in @entity77 or @entity78			2
the whole of the back of the house is glass on the ground and first floors			2
decking stretches on to the beach , and there is a hot tub			1
stunning : the view of the sea from the property 's modern living room			2
the whole of the back of the house is glass on the ground and first floors meet the locals : @entity30 has a house in the exclusive cul - de - sac alongside comedian @entity22 ‘ bringing the sea into the house was the aim , ’ says @entity74 , a retired @entity101 doctor			1
‘ bizarrely , the former owners did n’t make use of the sea views			2
so i opened up the back and put the terrace in and the balcony upstairs			0
‘ now , when you walk in the front door you can see the sea from everywhere			2
it took a year but it was well worth it			0
it still takes my breath away every time i come home			0
‘ and sitting outside on the terrace with a fish barbecue with the sound system on full is just perfect			0
i ’ve had a lot of impromptu parties			0
’ @entity74 , in his 60s and the father of four grown - up children , bought the four - bedroom house in 2010 after moving from @entity129 , where he had seen @entity30 perform at the @entity130 in what he describes as his favourite gig of all time			1
so when the singer moved in to the @entity34 , he was ‘ starstruck ’			0
‘ she has this lovely little dog and , in the summer , when all the doors are open , the dog wanders into my house and @entity30 comes round to find it			1
she ’s completely normal and everyone here is very pleasant and we all get on well , ’ says @entity74			0
@entity144 £ 4 million @entity8 , @entity145 @entity146 4 @entity147 features @entity148 for a back garden ; cinema room ; huge dressing room ; high - tech controls for hi - fi , curtains , lighting ; celebrities on every side he also welcomed @entity22 and his wife , model @entity159 , by taking round a bunch of flowers			1
unhappily they have now split up			0
@entity25 popped round one day when he heard that @entity74 was selling his vinyl record collection			1
‘ i thought he might buy the lot , but he did n’t want any of them , ’ he laughs			0
the ground floor of @entity74 ’s house has oak flooring throughout and there is a large entrance hall with a floating staircase , a media / cinema room , kitchen , snug and a 45ft lounge			0
upstairs , the master suite and bathroom overlook the sea and a huge dressing room is the size of some of the designer clothes shops in the nearby @entity184 of @entity185			0
@entity74 ’s home has the latest high - tech automated systems , including a @entity189 lighting control system , video door entry , digital music and video systems , integrated speakers , motorised curtains – in fact , everything a celebrity would be looking for			0
so who does he think will buy the house ? has @entity25 already been round with an offer to add to his portfolio ? ‘ no he has n’t , ’ says @entity74			1
‘ i think he ’s happy with what he has at the moment			0
but whoever does buy will never get tired of the wonderful , ever - changing views			0
like me , they ’ll fall in love with it straight away			0
’ selling agent @entity210 says : ‘ this is the best beach residence to come on the market for years and one of the very few homes in @entity185 , indeed the @entity45 , to have direct private beach access			1

@entity8 promenade 's white @entity4 houses are filled with @entity45 celebrities
@entity30 and dj @entity25 among stars who own on beach front
the properties were built between 1909 and 1910 by @entity42
one of the houses has gone on the market for a guide price of £ 4million
