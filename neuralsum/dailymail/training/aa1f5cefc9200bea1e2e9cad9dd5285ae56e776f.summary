by @entity0 published : 12:59 est , 30 may 2012 updated : 12:59 est , 30 may 2012 a hidden ' back door ' in a computer chip could allow cyber-criminals a way to override and control computer systems on @entity7			1
the vulnerability is in an @entity10 chip used in their computer systems , and seems to be hard - wired into the devices			1
this could mean the vulnerability - in chips used in @entity18 's flagship dreamliner - is near - impossible to eradicate			2
the security researchers who found the vulnerability have alerted governments around the world to the ' back door ' - which could leave critical aircraft systems vulnerable			1
a hidden ' back door ' in a computer chip could allow cyber-criminals a way to override and control computer systems on @entity18 787s this sort of vulnerability is unusual - most hacks use software , but a ' back door ' in such a critical system could allow malicious attackers a way ' past ' computer protection systems			1
' back doors ' are commonly built into computer systems by programmers to allow quick and easy access - but on a chip of this sort , represent a dangerous vulnerability			0
security researcher @entity46 of @entity47 told @entity48 , ' an attacker can disable all the security on the chip , reprogram cryptographic and access keys … or permanently damage the device			0
' the real issue is the level of security that can be compromised through any back door , and how easy they are to find and exploit			2
' security researchers have previously suggested that @entity62 companies build vulnerabilities into chips that are exported to the @entity65 for use in military systems			0
' back doors ' are commonly built into computer systems by programmers to allow quick and easy access - but on a chip of this sort , represent a dangerous vulnerability in this case , however , the ' back door ' may be innocent - although now it has been discovered , it remains a threat			2
@entity77 of @entity79 security , told @entity48 , ' this kind of flaw that gives somebody access right into the device has inherent flaws			0
the fact that it ’s in the hardware will certainly make it harder – if not impossible – to eradicate			0
