@entity0 took a major step towards qualification for the last four of the @entity3 after they dismantled @entity4 on wednesday night			1
@entity6 's @entity5 takes a look at five things we learned from @entity0 's emphatic victory			0
@entity11 it feels rather strange now but there was a time last summer when we were all wondering whether @entity16 - with his penchant for a human - based snack during football matches - was worth all that money for @entity0			1
there can be no question anymore			0
it is now 17 goals for the season and @entity0 's front three , spearheaded by @entity16 , @entity27 and @entity28 is the most in - form in world football			1
they are a frightening prospect and @entity16 , after three goals in his first 12 games for @entity0 , has hit the high notes at the right time			1
he has scored 10 in his last 11 games - including two crucial goals away at @entity39 - and his understanding with his strike partners has elevated this @entity0 side to a new level			1
@entity16 scores his second of the night to give @entity0 a 3 - 0 lead in their tie at @entity4 the former @entity48 forward is mobbed by his @entity0 team - mates after doubling his tally for the evening @entity4 yearn for @entity52 's quality prior to this game , @entity4 were unbeaten so far this season when playing without @entity52 , winning 11 and drawing 5 of the 16 games			1
it had developed a view - nourished by that inspiring performance when @entity57 was sent off at @entity58 - that @entity4 may be a stronger collective unit without the @entity60			1
yet on the grandest occasions , you still require that moment of world - class quality and @entity65 really needed @entity66 to stand tall here			1
@entity52 , pictured in action on saturday , missed the game against @entity0 through suspension @entity66 failed to deliver the goods for @entity4 and looked out - of - sorts against @entity0 on wednesday once more , though , the @entity73 failed to deliver on the biggest stage			1
@entity4 fans still wince at the memory of his miss against @entity58 at @entity78 last season and so often , he leaves you wanting more in these pivotal games			2
he was brilliantly denied by a @entity83 challenge in the first half but you sensed he lacked the conviction to really make the most of the opportunity			0
he does some wonderful things , moving with pace and intelligence but when faced with a guilt - edged opening , he too often loses that defining ability to remain cool and detached when faced by a goalkeeper and the roar of the crowd			0
when bearing down on @entity83 in the first half , he was like a pianist whose timing has deserted him , hesitating and pontificating			0
it is now only four goals in 15 games and you can perhaps understand why @entity4 may be tempted to cash in on him			2
@entity28 back in form after a run of three goals in 10 games , the @entity105 had begun to fade into the shadows a little , particularly when placed against the the brilliance of @entity27 and @entity16			1
the local rumour mill had begun swirling and there were suggestions - not without foundation - in the @entity116 media that @entity28 is unhappy with how often he is substituted by his manager			2
this was a good response			0
he remains such a talent and the opening goal tonight was clinically dispatched and marked his 28th goal of an excellent season			0
@entity27 was pulling the strings as ever but @entity28 was the most eye - catching @entity0 forward in the first - half			1
@entity28 was @entity0 's most eye - catching forward in the first half of their victory against @entity4 @entity28 celebrates with @entity16 after the @entity73 scored his first of two goals against @entity4 @entity4 's @entity133 home run comes to an end this victory for @entity0 brought a shuddering end to @entity4 's proud unbeaten run at the @entity138 in @entity140 competition			1
@entity0 are the first team to win here in either the @entity142 or @entity3 since @entity143 in 2006 - an undefeated streak that had lasted nine years , yielding 22 wins and 11 draws			2
in truth , the victory was rarely in doubt from the first whistle , such was @entity0 's composure and quality on the ball			0
sir @entity153 once described the experience of facing @entity0 's passing game as like being on a ' carousel '			0
@entity4 started brightly and for a few moments , it looked like the carousel might have malfunctioned			2
but it was no more than a glitch			0
@entity4 hopped on and when the referee finally called time , they staggered off across the fairground , most probably feeling rather sick			2
@entity165 and @entity166 reflect on @entity4 's defeat ... their first at home in @entity140 football since 2006 @entity171 is the midfield maestro we have marvelled for years at the gifts of @entity175 and @entity176 and while the shielding work of @entity179 has also been appreciated , it does seem as though he has become even more prominent under @entity180			1
he reads the game with such intelligence , stepping in with poise and composure to mop up the danger			0
those around him - @entity176 , @entity187 and @entity175 add the decoration - but @entity171 ' consistent brilliance forms the foundations of this @entity0 midfield			0
every team is grateful to its ' water - carriers ' , as @entity194 once dubbed @entity195 , but with @entity171 in this form , @entity0 could be heading towards the champagne come the end of the season			0
@entity179 ' consistent brilliance forms the foundations of the @entity0 midfield			0

@entity16 scored a brace while @entity28 also *netted* in 3 - 1 win at @entity4
@entity16 has 17 goals for the season after slow start to life at the @entity209
@entity16 , @entity27 and @entity28 is the best front three in world football
@entity4 missed @entity52 's world - class qualities in their defeat
