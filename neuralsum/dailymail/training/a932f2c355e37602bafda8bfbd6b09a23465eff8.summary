by @entity0 fit for a prince : @entity2 is being treated to a themed birthday party to see in his first year one might think a future monarch ’s first birthday party would be a palatial affair with tiny party crowns , a miniature throne , perhaps even a few liveried footmen carrying in a towering cake to the sound of trumpets , as saluting soldiers march past the regal tot			1
in truth , however , the @entity17 tradition of first birthdays has always tended towards the simple			2
the @entity21 take the view that , as tinies wo n’t remember the celebration , there ’s little point in bothering			1
the @entity28 ’s parents were away on tour when she turned one			0
the @entity31 was on naval duty in @entity33 when prince @entity34 woke up in @entity35 on his first birthday ( though he did send a model plane )			0
even prince @entity38 was alone with his nanny , @entity39 , because his parents were in @entity41 on his first birthday			0
they held a belated party at @entity43 the next month			2
fortunately for peachy - cheeked @entity44 , he can rely on the @entity45 , who make it their business — literally — to throw a good party			1
today , a full three days before his actual birthday , @entity2 was due to be taken by his parents to the @entity51 ’ home outside @entity53 in @entity54			1
there , his doting grandmother @entity55 has arranged a @entity58 - themed party that brands him a very middle - class little prince			1
although it is being described as a low - key ‘ private family occasion ’ , much thought has gone into making it a perfect first birthday			0
the presents — a football , wooden train , fleecy top and special photos and recordings — will not be lavish but have been chosen with love and care : there will be a special cake from his @entity75 nanny , a piece of lace from his @entity80 housekeeper , a beautiful polo top and sun hat from @entity55 and his aunt @entity83			2
who better to be in charge than the @entity51 , who have built an entire business empire on infant celebrations ? their seven - bedroom @entity90 pile , set in 18 acres , is the perfect venue , being spacious and familiar to @entity2 , who spent the first few weeks of his life there , being wheeled round the idyllic , rather @entity97 garden			1
a cursory glance at the family website , @entity100 , tells us that @entity55 , like @entity83 , loves a themed event			2
‘ when she chooses a theme there ’s no holding back , ’ says a friend			0
‘ there will be pictures and posters everywhere , vol au vents in the shape of rabbits , fun trails , you name it			0
she always uses all her own stuff from @entity100 and runs it like a military manoeuvre , while @entity118 hangs back somewhere , full of bonhomie			0
’ business : although the @entity21 tend towards muted affairs for infants ' birthdays , @entity121 is a professional party - thrower , and her grandson 's first birthday party will receive the full treatment in choosing @entity58 , @entity129 ’s delightfully naughty , greedy bunny who first appeared in 1902 , @entity55 could not have picked a theme more wonderfully symbolic of middle - class values : @entity129 is the @entity133 of children ’s authors — safe , enduring and moral			1
@entity58 is her particularly beloved creation , the immature bunny who , like all small boys , wants to test the limits of his liberty : he disobeys and nearly ends up in a pie like his father , before running home to his mother			2
the now defunct left - wing @entity147 banned him and his cousin @entity149 from @entity151 schools in the 1980s because it said the rabbits were too bourgeois			0
@entity44 ’s bunny - themed bash is planned as an ‘ extended family party ’ to kick off his first birthday party week ( on tuesday , the day itself , he will probably have a second celebration organised by @entity158 at @entity159 )			1
' the place will be groaning with 1970s party food			0
@entity55 is a real feeder ' the @entity53 affair will last no less than two hours but no more than three , so exhaustion and tears do n’t set in			2
besides the @entity51 , godmother @entity170 , her husband @entity167 and their six - month - old daughter @entity168 are on the guest list			1
‘ there will be lots of finger food , oodles of fresh fruit , organic ice creams and fresh fruit sorbets			1
he ’ll have @entity58 cake and home - made baby - bunny biscuits , ’ says one close source			1
the adults will have plenty to nibble , too			0
‘ @entity55 ’s a real feeder , ’ says another friend			2
‘ the place will be groaning with 1970s - style party food that the guests wo n’t be able to avoid eating			1
’ @entity44 and friends will be seated , apparently , on bean bags printed with animal faces , one of which has ‘ @entity2 ’ embroidered on it			1
@entity158 , like @entity55 , loves anything personalised			1
pride of place will go to @entity2 ’s ‘ first birthday book ’ , which has been meticulously compiled by @entity158 , who used to take photographs for the @entity100 website			1
it contains snaps of @entity2 , often alongside his beloved companion , @entity205 the black cocker spaniel ; his crowd - pleasing trip to @entity209 and @entity210 ; his first steps and many ‘ fun snippets ’			1
@entity158 and @entity38 have also made a cd of songs and lullabies which includes them singing ‘ @entity217 ’			2
the @entity218 are giving him a traditional wooden train with the carriages spelling out his name ( presumably that ’s the full @entity44 )			0
@entity121 classic : the family business is partial to a themed party , marketing these invitations for any other children wishing to follow suit with a @entity58 themed party he will also receive a personalised fleecy dressing - gown , and prince @entity38 has had a hand - stitched football made for him ( possibly in the colours of @entity233 , the team @entity38 supports )			1
@entity205 is ‘ giving ’ @entity44 a paw - printed photograph of himself and @entity2 playing in the garden			1
although the firm instruction has been issued that @entity2 is not to be spoilt , a gratifying , good - natured rivalry has built up among the @entity17 ’ staff to see who can give @entity2 the most original , moving and comment - worthy present			1
to this end , @entity158 and @entity38 ’s housekeeper , @entity244 , is having a pillow made for him out of @entity248 lace , the product of an intricate 14th - century technique involving many bobbins worked around a round pillow			1
the resulting lace is delicate , elaborate and very expensive			0
a piece of amber is also normally given on a first birthday in @entity80 , for the teething baby to suck			0
not to be outdone , nanny @entity255 is making a traditional @entity256 , a dense cake from @entity257 in northwest @entity75 , which is made with almonds , eggs , sugar and grated orange zest			0
it is supposed to bring good luck and usually has the @entity264 ( @entity265 ) on the top in dusted sugar			0
from this we can assume that @entity2 is not one of that growing army of children with a nut allergy			2
he can also expect to have his earlobe pulled , a @entity75 first birthday tradition to bring more good luck			0
@entity55 and @entity83 have been seen shopping in recent weeks in @entity277 , a fashionable @entity151 children ’s shop , for new outfits including shorts , sun hats , swimming shorts and polo tops , so there may well be gifts of clothes as well as toys			1
@entity289 is known for humorous presents : he once bought @entity55 some old plane seats ‘ so she could practise her “ doors to manual ” ’			2
@entity295 manufacturers of baby products will also be sending gifts			0
johnstons of @entity300 ( @entity302 holders for @entity34 ) , for instance , have made some cashmere cushions with ‘ @entity2 ’ knitted into them , in royal blue with cream lettering			1
@entity129 perfection : the winding gardens of the @entity309 ' @entity54 estate will be the ideal setting @entity44 even has his own commemorative birthday coin from the @entity313 , a £ 5 ( always the chosen amount for royal celebrations ) coin in silver ( the metal that must cross a baby ’s palm to bring health and wealth )			1
a limited edition of 7,500 are being made at £ 80 each			0
otherwise , the @entity90 silver presents traditional on a first birthday — spoons , boxes , eggcups — will be the domain of wealthier godparents such as 23 - year - old @entity331 , heir to the @entity331 , and long - time family friend @entity333			0
both will see the @entity218 separately as neither is coming to the party			0
ten - month - old @entity337 , son of godfather @entity338 ( a contemporary of the couple at @entity342 ) and godson of @entity158 , might make it ; alongside fellow godmother and interior designer @entity345			1
one friend says : ‘ @entity348 and @entity158 want to keep @entity44 ’s first birthday as private and family - oriented as possible			2
he can expect to have his earlobe pulled by nanny @entity255 - a @entity75 first birthday tradition to bring more good luck if @entity2 wants to throw toys , have a teething fit , pull @entity205 ’s tail or be noisy , they want to be surrounded by family who will keep it all under wraps			2
he is their only child and they want his first birthday to be memorable , fun and strictly unfussy			0
whether the @entity58 theme is considered middle - class will not trouble them one jot			2
‘ they are all unconcerned about the social nuances of a themed first birthday party for the heir to the throne			0
it will go swimmingly because that is what the @entity51 are famous for doing			0
attention to detail is their byword			0
’ one family friend says that , like most mothers of babies who get the opportunity , @entity158 hands @entity2 over to @entity55 the moment she gets to @entity53 ( the nanny does n’t normally go with them , and will give her present to the prince at @entity159 ) , which suits everyone because @entity55 likes to be in control of her own domain just as much as @entity158 likes a rest			1
@entity44 ’s first @entity53 birthday party is a reminder that he is most certainly 50 per cent @entity121			0
and , given that the @entity17 option would n’t have been nearly so much fun , he is all the better off for it .			0

@entity21 prefer simple parties for infants who wo *n't* remember it
but @entity2 has the @entity404 who make it their business to celebrate
@entity55 has planned @entity58 party at @entity54 estate for ' close friends '
@entity2 and infants including @entity414 ' daughter @entity168 will sit on personalised bean bags and eat organic ice cream during 3 - hour party
he will then have a party at @entity159 organised by @entity158
