a paramedic who abandoned patients in an ambulance while he went shopping and had a hair cut has been found guilty of misconduct at a health tribunal			1
@entity7 , who has resigned from the @entity8 , twice ' held his colleagues to ransom ' by forcing them to wait until his return before they could be driven to hospital			1
the @entity14 ( @entity15 ) sitting at a hearing in @entity17 , south @entity13 , today ruled he was guilty of misconduct relating to two incidents in march 2013 and he was struck off the medical register			1
@entity7 , who was not present at the hearing , was found guilty of two counts of misconduct while working with the @entity8 in the first incident , an 85 - year - old man who collapsed in the queue in a @entity25 store from severe blood poisoning was forced to wait for 20 minutes in the back of an ambulance			1
@entity7 , who failed to turn up at the hearing , had returned to the store and came back with two full bags of shopping before driving him to hospital on march 9 , 2013			1
the tribunal heard @entity7 's colleague , who was left to care for the elderly man alone , was questioned by the patient 's ' anxious ' wife about why her husband had not been taken to hospital			2
@entity40 said : ' after a little bit of time i wondered where [ @entity7 ] had gone			0
' the wife was understandably anxious about what had happened to her husband and was wondering why we were n't leaving to go to hospital			0
' he then came back with two full bags of shopping and loaded them in to the front of the ambulance and flippantly said ' do you want to go to hospital then ? '			0
' obviously , i wanted to go to hospital some time ago			0
i waited 20 minutes for @entity7 while alone in the ambulance			1
' the panel heard how @entity7 left a patient in an ambulance with a colleague for 20 minutes while he did some shopping in a @entity25 ( file picture ) just two weeks later , while responding to another potentially life - threatening 999 call , he delayed a 40 - year - old patient with a head injury from being taken to hospital and left him in the care of a more junior practitioner so he could have his hair cut			1
@entity7 admitted abandoning his colleagues and patients , but the panel said his failure to turn up to the hearing meant they could not know if he appreciated the seriousness of his actions , meaning there was a ' risk of repetition '			2
paramedic @entity82 , who had arrived at the scene first , said she was handing over care of the patient to @entity7 's colleague when she noticed a nearby shopper looking ' gobsmacked '			0
she told the panel : ' i looked to my left and saw @entity7 sitting at the hairdresser 's chair with a lady putting a cape around his neck			2
' she told the hearing she had thought he was ' just having a joke ' when he earlier asked her whether she fancied a haircut , and added that he could do with a trim himself			0
the panel heard that he delayed the ambulance leaving for hospital by between five and ten minutes			2
chairman of the panel , @entity102 , said members of the public would be ' shocked ' to know a paramedic could show such disregard for his patients saying his ' fitness to practise was impaired '			1
ms @entity102 added that they do not know if @entity7 , who joined the @entity8 in 1996 , has since continued to work as a paramedic			2
ms @entity102 said today : ' whilst it appears no harm was caused , the potential impact of the registrant 's actions could have had serious consequences for the patients			0
' the registrant 's actions may indicate an attitudinal problem which he appears to have taken no real steps to address			0
' there 's no evidence to suggest his behaviour has changed			0
' ms @entity102 said @entity7 would be struck off the @entity15 register with immediate effect , adding : ' the registrant has shown little in the way of insight or remorse			1
' the panel considers that a striking off order is the only appropriate and proportionate order in this case			0
