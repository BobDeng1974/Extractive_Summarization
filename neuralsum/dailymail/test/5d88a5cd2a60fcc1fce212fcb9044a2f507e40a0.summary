@entity0 is to counter-sue the woman who is suing her for stealing her chicken			1
the actress and her fiance @entity4 responded to the impending lawsuit with a tongue - in - cheek video , claiming they were going to file a lawsuit against the accuser @entity9 , because of injuries suffered while being forced to watch her music video			1
on wednesday the story broke that the 31 - year - old was being sued for $ 5,000 by a woman claiming to be her former childhood friend , who said she suffered emotional trauma when a seven - year - old @entity0 stole her pet foul			1
fight fire with fire : @entity0 has responded to @entity9 's accusations she stole her chicken as a child , with a video claiming she will counter-sue for injuries sustained while watching @entity26 's music video but within hours @entity4 had posted a video - obtained by @entity28 - pointing out some of the holes in @entity26 's story			1
' let 's just get this clear : you stole a chicken from a one - month - old child who spoke to you in an entire conversation , ' the 37 - year - old declares in the self - shot vid			2
' it 's just shocking to me			0
not only did she have a conversation at one - month old in @entity43 , she was speaking @entity44 ! this is the smartest girl i 've ever heard of ! ' @entity0 herself appears on the clip pointing out that it must be ' just coincidental ' he accuser has a new music video out , and is trying to launch a singing career here in @entity52			1
foul play : the reason for @entity26 's lawsuit 25 years after the ' theft ' is that moving to @entity52 , which is where @entity0 also lives , has brought back memories of losing ' doggie ' for @entity26 and forced her back into therapy ' i was devastated			1
i was like " which chicken did i steal ? " because i was obviosly in the village when i stole these chickens			2
so i apologise to this woman who was maybe or maybe not a month old , ' she said			0
the @entity66 star admits that she has yet to be physically served the documents , and then reveals she is preparing her own counter-suit			0
' but emotionally i feel served			0
i would like to launch a counter $ 5,000 lawsuit for making me sit there and watch you music video , shamelessly			1
my eyes hurt , they 're burning			0
' ' @entity78 for you , ' @entity4 admonishes into the camera , in response to her song title plea @entity82 , which currently has almost 170k views on @entity85			0
the couple then turn semi-serious to address the charges			0
' i feel like i will be a chicken fighter for a very long time			0
i will be an advocate			0
i would never steal someone else 's chicken			0
i would n't , i would n't , ' @entity0 insists			0
' listen folks , i believe this woman , i know her pretty well , i believe that shes an ethical person that would n't steal a chicken , ' @entity4 adds			2
' so you have it right from the horse 's ... the chicken 's mouth			0
' not a bad egg : @entity0 , seen here with partner @entity4 in @entity104 , had being accused of chicken theft despite growing up more than 100miles from @entity26			1
@entity4 pointed out in their response video that their accuser was also one - month old at the time and apparently fluent in @entity44 and @entity111 @entity113 loco : in her suit , @entity26 alleges that when ' doggie ' disappeared , @entity0 confessed to the crime and told her ' @entity9 , you can have any other chicken as a pet , you have a whole chicken farm ' ( stock image ) @entity26 had alleged that she was a classmate of @entity0 , who moved to the @entity124 from @entity43 in 1991 , and that the pair were ' inseparable ' growing up			1
the wannabe singer , now living in @entity104 , claimed a seven - year - old @entity0 had been ' envious ' of her pet hen , and that 25 years ago , she stole it from her			2
in her lawsuit , @entity26 states that ms @entity0 would come over to the chicken farm in north - west @entity43 where she lived , and play with the hen , called ' doggie ' , @entity28 reported			1
she alleges that when ' doggie ' disappeared , ms @entity0 confessed to the crime and told her ' @entity9 , you can have any other chicken as a pet , you have a whole chicken farm ' , the website states			2
@entity26 , who has moved to @entity104 in the hopes of launching a career as a singer , says the theft of her pet chicken traumatised her and forced her to see a therapist			1
she claims that being in close proximity to ms @entity0 , who lives in @entity149 with partner @entity4 and daughter @entity150 , has ' brought back all the bad memories ' and she now needs therapy again			2
she also claims the theft of ' doggie ' 25 years ago has ' prevented her from pursuing the @entity156 ' , according to @entity28			0
interestingly enough , @entity26 's self - penned online bio describes her as being ' born and raised in the small village @entity159 ' , which is a three hour drive - and more than 100miles away - from @entity161 , where @entity0 lived before moving to the @entity124 aged seven			1
wannabe : @entity0 deduces it must be ' just coincidence ' @entity26 is trying to launch a music career just as she threatens with the lawsuit			2
