by @entity0 published : 06:30 est , 30 january 2013 updated : 09:43 est , 30 january 2013 these are the first pictures inside the cockpit of the new @entity5 military - funded airship that is set to revolutionise long - haul flying			1
the massive blimp - like aircraft made its first successful test flight after hovering a dozen feet off the floor of the former military hangar during flight testing south of @entity13			1
the fact that the hulking @entity15 could fly for just a few minutes represents a step forward in aviation , according to the engineers who developed it			2
' i realised that i put a little dot in the line of aviation history ' : electrical engineer @entity24 , left , and aerospace engineer @entity27 chat in the @entity15 's cockpit mr @entity30 works in the cockpit : the flight control engineer said the biggest challenge he faces is making sure the airship will be able to withstand high winds and other extreme weather conditions sitting in the high - tech cockpit , flight control engineer @entity37 told of his pride at being involved in the groundbreaking project			1
' i realised that i put a little dot in the line of aviation history			0
a little dot for something that has never been demonstrated before , now it 's feasible , ' he told the @entity46			0
the high - tech @entity15 blimp is now nearly ready for flight testing in the open , having completed its ' first float ' manoeuvres inside its colossal hangar in @entity53 , @entity54			1
the biggest challenge for engineers is making sure the airship will be able to withstand high winds and other extreme weather conditions , mr @entity30 said			2
the @entity15 , a prototype airship , sits inside its hangar in @entity61 , @entity54 : the high - tech blimp is nearly ready for flight testing , having now completed its ' first float ' manoeuvres carried out inside the hangar engineer @entity67 pulls down the flab on the @entity15 : built around a frame of aluminium and carbon fibre , the huge 230ft prototype is nevertheless only half the size of the conceived finished version the @entity75 and @entity76 have invested $ 35 million in project because of its potential to one day carry more cargo than any other aircraft to disaster zones and forward military bases			1
built around a rigid frame of aluminium and carbon fibre , the huge 230ft prototype , built by @entity5 aviation firm @entity84 , is nevertheless only half the size of its conceived finished version			1
earlier pictures of the bulbous blimp , with its silver skin reflecting green lights shining within the hangar , invited comparisons with @entity95 , the rescue craft from @entity99 's puppet adventure series @entity97			1
military funded : the @entity75 and @entity76 have invested $ 35 million in the prototype because of its potential to one day carry more cargo than any other aircraft to disaster zones and forward military bases the airship has been undergoing testing this month in a 17 - storey tall , @entity108 - era blimp hangar at the former @entity109			1
it must go through several more rounds of flight tests before it could be used in a disaster zone or anywhere else			2
but if and when it finally goes into service , the @entity15 airship will carry three times as much as the biggest military cargo planes , use a third of the fuel - and it wo n't even need a landing strip			1
it could revolutionise haulage , and almost everything now laboriously transported across the planet 's surface by boat , train and lorry could within years be carried through the skies , its makers claim			0
@entity84 said it also must secure more funding for the next round of flight testing , but is hopeful the @entity75 and others will step in again as investors			2
it says the cargo airship 's potential to carry more cargo more efficiently than ever before would provide the military with an advantage on the battlefield and greater capacity to save more lives during natural disasters			1
impressive : @entity146 , the host of @entity150 's @entity149 show , uses his smartphone to photograph the @entity15 airship inside its colossal hangar at the former @entity109 in @entity53 @entity84 ceo and founder @entity155 recently confirmed the vehicle had completed a series of successful ' first float ' manoeuvres inside its immense engineering hangar			1
mr @entity155 , who is also the chief engineer of the @entity15 , explained that the tests had proven its unique lightweight rigid structure conception and vertical take off and landing systems			1
' the first float of the vehicle was a controlled exercise during which all flight systems were operating			2
the procedure was completed successfully , ' he said			2
aircraft experts are betting that the @entity15 vehicle with its advanced technology capabilities will transform the transportation of large and heavy cargoes			1
it has the potential to support any number of the world ’s equipment - dependent mega-projects and the industries that manage them – including wind energy , aerospace , fossil fuel extraction , highway construction , engineering and telecommunications			0
international rescue : the silver - skinned @entity15 prototype sits in its hangar , where green light reflecting from it makes it look uncannily like @entity192 a concept of the airship on the battlefield , where it could be used to transport tanks and soldiers directly onto the front line the airship functions like a submarine , releasing air to rise and taking in air to descend , said @entity84 mechanical engineer @entity204			1
it can take off vertically , like a helicopter , then change its buoyancy to become heavier than air for landing and unloading			0
' it allows the vehicle to set down on the ground			0
and then when we want to become lighter than air , we release that air and then the vehicle floats and we can allow it to take off , ' mr @entity204 said			0
the radical design has been likened to that of @entity95 the project has set abuzz the old hangars at the @entity222			0
the structures were built to hold blimps during the @entity108			2
now workers zip around in cherry - pickers , and the airship 's silvery surface shines against the warm tones of the aging wood of the walls			0
' you could take this vehicle and go to destinations that have been destroyed , where there 's no ports , no runways , stuff like that , ' said mr @entity204 ' this vehicle could go in there , offload the cargo even if there 's no infrastructure , no landing site for it to land on , this vehicle can unload its whole payload			2
' the finished version of the @entity15 - expected to be ready in three years - will be 450ft long and carry a payload of 66 tons at a speed of 120 knots , up to 18,000ft with a range of 3000 nautical miles			1
that could revolutionise air transport , opening up remote areas where there is practically no other means of access			0
it could carry relief supplies for victims in disaster areas , heavy oil - extraction equipment to northern @entity263 's tar sands , huge turbines to remote wind farms and , of course , heavy military equipment to battlefields worldwide			1
fill ' er up : at 77m ( 250ft ) in length , the prototype @entity15 is just half the size of the final model , but has been built with the same rigid structure , flight control systems and landing gear the ' skeleton ' of the airship being built in @entity54 the key breakthrough has been the development of an internal system for managing ballast			1
previous airships have been held back by the need to weigh them down or tie them up while cargo is unloaded , lest they are suddenly carried away on the breeze			0
but the @entity15 's internal ballast management system gives its operators the ability to control the aircraft 's buoyancy by compressing the helium inside its tanks and replacing it with normal air to bring down to the ground			1
once cargo has been loaded , the airship can rise by re-releasing the compressed helium into its containment tanks , making it again lighter than air , then using turbo - prop engines to control its direction			2
because of this revolutionary system , @entity15 needs no airfield to operate , only a cleared area large enough for it to vertically take off and land , and enough labour on hand to unload the cargo			1
limited : conventional airships are held back by the need for infrastructure that can enable ground crews to fill them with ballast as they are unloaded to stop them from floating away on the breeze @entity320 ballast : the @entity15 , by contrast , is able to control its buoyancy using an internal ballast management system which means it can land anywhere that there is space to touch down mr @entity155 , 48 , told @entity327 : ' the advantage is you do n’t need ground infrastructure			2
you can fly anywhere , you can land anywhere , you do n’t need any ballast , you do n’t need any ground crew			0
' the airship has long been a ' dream machine ' for visionary inventors			0
count @entity338 built the first airship in 1900 as a weapon for @entity341			0
the ' @entity342 ' was developed by dr @entity343 , who flew it around the world in 21 days in 1929			0
this powerful symbol of @entity341 might was adopted by the @entity348 , who funded the creation of the largest airship yet , the @entity351			0
however , on may 6 , 1937 , the @entity351 burst into flames on a trip to the @entity5 , having been filled with patriotic @entity341 hydrogen instead of @entity5 helium			2
the future : an artist 's impression shows how the @entity15 might look as it picks up cargo from a distribution centre			1
finished models will carry 66 tons over a distance of 3,000 nautical miles at 120 knots the ship could also be used for major construction projects such as building large pipes , as it does not require a runway to land but @entity368 - born mr @entity155 says that his design for a rigid airship is miles apart from the disastrous versions of the early @entity372			1
he told @entity327 : ' from the structure stand point , all of us are familiar with the @entity351 and @entity342 designs			0
we built a space frame that sits inside of the vehicle and around the frame we built a rigid cell			0
the function of the rigid cell is to have it work with the aerodynamic laws			0
it ’s a very simple approach			0
' it also allows us to build vehicles very rapidly			0
when you ’re talking about the production of vehicles , you need the ability to build number of them in a short term and with the frames you can do this			0

@entity15 has completed its ' first float ' tests inside colossal @entity108 blimp hangar in @entity53 , @entity54
new pictures show inside the high - tech cockpit of the revolutionary aircraft which is funded by @entity5 @entity75
finished version will carry three times more than the biggest military cargo planes over *thousands* of miles
it is capable of vertical take off and landing and does n't even need a landing strip
