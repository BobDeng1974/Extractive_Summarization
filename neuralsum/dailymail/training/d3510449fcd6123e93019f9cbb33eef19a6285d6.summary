there was a mixture of excitement and terror on @entity5 ’s face as he rolled the tiny olive around in his hand			1
and who could blame him ? for this was no ordinary olive			2
it was an olive from the first harvest ever grown commercially in @entity13			1
and 42 - year - old @entity5 , a management consultant who grew the olives on a plot of land outside his kitchen window , was about to step into the history books			1
inspired : @entity5 and @entity19 ( pictured with their daughters @entity22 , 7 , and @entity23 , 4 ) have opened the @entity13 's first olive farm after falling in love with the idea during their honeymoon on the @entity29 in @entity30 in 2002 despite knowing very little about the industry , the couple bought 200 trees from a small farm in northern @entity30 yes , the @entity35 might possibly have done it — but it ’s taken another 2,000 years and a man on a culinary crusade to make it happen in 2014 in a garden in @entity42 ’s @entity41			1
it ’s an achievement no one imagined possible			0
not @entity5 ’s curious neighbours			1
not even his long - suffering wife , @entity19 , and daughters , @entity22 , seven and four - year - old @entity23			1
but last week @entity5 fulfilled a decade - long dream to develop @entity13 ’s first productive olive grove			1
it all started during the couple ’s honeymoon in @entity30			1
having met in 1999 while both working in @entity53 — @entity5 for a market research company and @entity55 — they married in @entity56 in 2002 and left for a two - week honeymoon on the @entity58 was as they lay in a grove of olives to shelter from the afternoon sun that @entity5 had his epiphany			1
‘ we joked that if we won the lottery , we would buy an olive grove in @entity30 , ’ recalls @entity5			1
‘ @entity19 , being the pragmatist of the two of us , thought i was mad			1
’ they never did win the lottery , but @entity5 held onto his dream			1
back in @entity56 , their careers and life continued in a familiar rhythm			2
@entity22 was born in march 2006 and @entity23 in september 2009			0
then , in 2010 , @entity5 and @entity19 decided to move away from the hubbub of the capital , and bought a four - bedroom @entity80 farmhouse on @entity42 ’s @entity41 with a four - acre plot of land			1
preparation : the couple bought 200 trees from a small farm in northern @entity30 and planted them in their four - acre back garden on the @entity41 in @entity42 the plan was that @entity5 would commute to work in @entity56 , while @entity19 would run an interiors business from home			1
throughout those daily train journeys , @entity5 would constantly return to his dream			1
‘ our land had n’t been cultivated for 40 years and we were told it was only good for grazing , ’ @entity5 explains			1
‘ but it seemed such a waste			0
‘ then , one summer ’s night , we were sitting on our terrace with a glass of wine and i looked out at the land and thought : why buy an olive grove in @entity107 when we could do the same thing here ? ‘ the land is south - facing and free - draining , and we are in one of the warmest parts of the country			1
olives can tolerate poor soil and exposure to wind			0
i just knew we had to give it a go			0
‘ i was on the computer the next day , researching olive varieties			2
it had n’t been done before — but that only made it more exciting			0
’ @entity5 decided to start with a small - scale trial , choosing 12 trees of six different varieties from local garden centres			1
‘ i planted them in march 2011			0
the summer was hot and dry and the trees did brilliantly			2
i was n’t expecting any fruit — the key was knowing whether the trees would survive			2
’ it was all the encouragement that @entity5 needed			1
three varieties — @entity137 , @entity138 and @entity139 — had done particularly well , although it was too early in their life for them to have borne fruit			0
after that , @entity5 contacted dozens of growers in @entity30 to see if they could supply him with trees			1
in march 2012 , he found a traditional family - run nursery in northern @entity30 that seemed perfect			1
‘ they had the right trees — three years old , so not too expensive but still capable of giving a good yield			1
’ tough : the @entity5 family 's olives have endured frosts , snowfall and heavy rain , but have emerged unscathed with his heart in his mouth , @entity5 ordered 200 trees			1
each would cost upwards of £ 70 at a @entity13 garden centre — that ’s at least £ 14,000 for the grove			1
@entity5 is reluctant to say exactly how much he paid , but admits the venture has cost him just shy of £ 5,000 so far			2
after researching how sites are prepared for a @entity107 olive grove , @entity5 got to work			1
he commissioned a neighbouring farmer to prepare the site , spraying off the surface vegetation with chemicals			0
‘ i worried he would think i ’d gone nuts , ’ he admits			0
‘ but i guess the idea of an olive grove is so romantic that everyone has got behind it			2
’ @entity5 hired more machinery to allow him to mole plough — which means ripping deep into the soil to create channels for the water to drain easily			2
then the top soil needed to be prepared for planting with a rotivator			0
‘ i did n’t have the experience or machinery to do any of this myself , ’ admits @entity5			2
‘ i oversaw the work at weekends			0
’ @entity19 watched from the kitchen window as her meadow was ripped up			2
‘ it was a shock , ’ she admits			0
‘ it ’s one thing @entity5 having a pipe dream			2
following through is another thing entirely			0
’ just four weeks later , in april 2012 , a container arrived in the @entity199 ’ drive with 200 olive trees — and on a decidedly windswept , soggy day , @entity5 began the nerve - racking job of planting them , marshalling @entity19 , the girls , his mother , stepfather and a collection of curious neighbours to help			1
it took them two days to get the plants in			0
‘ i ’d researched planting schemes and opted to plant the trees seven metres apart , which gave us enough room to plant more in the future , ’ says @entity5			1
ideal : @entity5 ( right ) contacted dozens of growers in @entity30 to see if they could supply him with trees			1
in march 2012 , he found a traditional family - run nursery in northern @entity30 that seemed perfect peering out on the vulnerable - looking striplings over the following weeks and months , even @entity5 had to admit the whole project looked doomed			1
‘ it just kept raining , ’ he recalls			0
‘ the trees were being drenched every single day			2
i was worried the roots would n’t cope and the plants would die			0
yet somehow , thankfully , the trees survived			2
’ and so 2012 rolled into 2013 — but the weather remained terrible			0
‘ by the spring of 2013 , it looked like an olive graveyard ; a sea of brown twigs			0
i thought i ’d failed and they ’d all have to be dug up and thrown away			0
’ ‘ i went out every night to check on them			0
every so often the trees would try to come to life — but then another cold snap would kill off the new growth			0
’ but then , as june edged into july and the sun at last began to shine , the sea of brown twigs began to sprout bright green leaves			0
and one exciting morning , @entity5 noticed some tiny yellow flowers			2
‘ i tried not to be too optimistic , ’ he admits			0
but two weeks later there was no mistake			0
out of each flower a tiny pinhead was emerging			0
@entity13 ’s first olive grove was growing			1
progress was slow until one magical morning in september , @entity5 woke to see a mass of olives on his trees			1
it may have taken him ten years , but @entity5 had done it			2
‘ i got @entity19 and the girls out of bed — it ’s a day we ’ll never forget			2
’ the next hurdle was harvesting them			0
‘ i could n’t risk a frost getting to them , ’ explains @entity5			2
land : the couple built their olive farm on a four - acre plot in their back garden on the @entity41 in @entity42 in the first week of november , @entity5 decided it was time — and the family proceeded to hand - pick each olive			1
@entity19 used her trusty mop bucket ; the girls orange buckets left over from collecting @entity277 treats			2
‘ @entity19 and i concentrated on the top branches and the girls took the lower ones , ’ says @entity5			1
‘ we were there all weekend and every day after school			0
it took a week and produced around 20 kilos			0
’ @entity5 was desperate to taste his first home - grown olive — but that was a delight that had to wait until last week			1
‘ olives have to be cured in brine over many months to make them palatable , ’ he explains			0
‘ i sent some of my harvest off to a wonderful local chef who promised to work his magic			0
’ so what do the olives taste like ? i joined @entity5 at @entity297 , @entity298 , @entity42 , where chef @entity299 has been curing the olives in salted water since november			1
the first surprise is the intense colour			0
because of the shorter growing season , @entity5 ’s olives are tiny - barely bigger than a raisin - but they are a brilliant olive green			1
and they taste , well , truly olivey			0
yes , the skin is harder than a normal table olive and there ’s less flesh , but the flavour is intense , each olive packing the flavour of four ordinary ones			0
‘ i did n’t dare hope they would taste good , ’ he says			0
chef @entity299 has already used some in flavoured butters and oils			0
his next move ? ‘ more olive trees			2
the land can support another 100 trees , so enough olives to produce @entity13 ’s first homegrown olive oil			1
‘ growing table olives is one thing			0
but producing a large enough crop to make oil is beyond my dreams			0

@entity5 and his wife @entity19 have opened the first olive farm in the @entity13
they built farm in their four - acre back garden on the @entity41 in @entity42
couple fell in love with idea of owning olive farm during honeymoon in @entity346
they bought 200 trees from @entity30 *suppliers* as @entity351 were too expensive
