by @entity0 a furious mother has hit out after her fit and active five - year - old son was branded ' overweight ' in a letter he brought home from school			1
@entity6 weighs less than 4st and enjoys swimming , cycling and trampolining			1
but the ' patronising ' letter to his parents claimed he was too heavy - and came with an enclosed leaflet on how to lead a healthy lifestyle			1
@entity14 , right , received a letter from her son @entity16 's school warning that the five - year - old who loves swimming and riding his bicycle was ' overweight ' @entity16 's mother , @entity14 , said : ' it is a complete load of rubbish			1
' @entity16 is just a normal little boy			0
he is quite tall and broad for his age , but he is in proportion			2
' when we take him swimming you can see his ribcage			0
he is very active - he walks home from school , he goes out on his trampoline and rides his bike			2
' we have a healthy lifestyle and set him a good example			2
when i go out running he will come with me on his bike for a couple of miles			0
' he would happily eat a stick of carrot over a bit of chocolate , but there is nothing wrong with having a treat now and again			0
" ' it is very patronising to be told your child is overweight in this way			1
' @entity16 's school used the @entity49 to determine that the five year old was was too heavy for a boy of his age the youngster from @entity55 , @entity53 is 3ft 9 inches tall and weighs 3st 10lbs			1
but according to height and weight measurements taken as part of the @entity60 , used to calculate a body mass index ( @entity49 ) score , he is overweight for his age and sex			1
mrs @entity14 said she was concerned the programme could put pressure on young children to start dieting			1
@entity16 brought the @entity70 letter home from @entity72 in @entity73 , @entity53			1
it read : ' the results suggest your child is overweight for their age , sex and height			1
if your child is overweight now , they are more likely to grow up to be overweight as an adult			1
this can lead to health problems			0
' you and @entity16 can make simple changes to be more active and eat more healthily			0
' a change 4 life leaflet was enclosed with the letter , which also advised mrs @entity88 to contact a patient advice and liaison service ( @entity91 )			1
it did not say by how much @entity16 was supposedly overweight , or what his @entity49 score was			0
mrs @entity14 added : ' there is so much pressure on adults to be thin , never mind children , and it is not fair to make children think they are overweight			1
' children are still growing and @entity49 does not take into account growth spurts			0
some children have puppy fat before shooting up			0
' common sense tells me @entity16 is not fat , but some parents may worry their children need to lose weight			0
' that puts pressure on them and you do n't want children exposed to dieting at that age			0
' according to @entity16 's mother @entity116 , the youngster would prefer eating a carrot slice to a chocolate bar and is very active @entity119 is used to measure their amount of body fat a person is carrying			1
medics use a modified @entity49 scale with children that takes account of their age and sex			1
one in three children in @entity130 is classed as ' overweight ' according to official government figures			0
children are classed as either underweight , healthy weight , overweight or very overweight			1
according the @entity135 : ' it can be difficult to tell if your child is overweight as they may look similar to other children of their age			1
that â€™s why we use the measurement of weight against height to get an accurate measure			2
' research shows that if your child is overweight now , they are more likely to grow up to be overweight as an adult			2
this can lead to health problems in later life , so this measurement is an important way of checking how your child is growing			0
' @entity156 , a senior public health manager at @entity70 , said the measurement programme was an important way of monitoring how many children in the county were overweight , and ensuring the right public health approach was taken			0
she added : ' if we can help ensure our children maintain a healthy weight , evidence shows they will have less weight - related health issues later in life			2
' the measurement programme can act as an early warning to flag to parents there may a developing issue that can be addressed			0
' the programme was introduced to help tackle child obesity			0
under the national scheme all four and five - year - olds and children aged 10 to 11 have their height and weight measured to create a national childhood obesity database			2
however , there has been some criticism of using @entity49 to determine whether someone was overweight or not			0
at 5ft 10 and weighing 14 stone 9 , former @entity130 and @entity187 captain @entity186 has a @entity49 of 29.3 and is classed as overweight			2
