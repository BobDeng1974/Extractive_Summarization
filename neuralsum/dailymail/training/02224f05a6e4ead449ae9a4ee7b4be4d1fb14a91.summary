by @entity0 state lawmakers on thursday passed a bill that would make @entity4 the first state to define when ' yes means yes ' while investigating sexual assaults on college campuses			1
the @entity7 unanimously passed @entity8 as states and universities across the @entity11 are under pressure to change how they handle rape allegations			1
the bill now goes to governor @entity15 , who has not indicated his stance on the bill			1
senator @entity17 , of @entity18 , said his bill would begin a paradigm shift in how @entity4 campuses prevent and investigate sexual assault			1
rather than using the refrain ' no means no ' , the definition of consent under the bill requires ' an affirmative , conscious and voluntary agreement to engage in sexual activity '			1
earlier versions of the bill had similar language			2
silence or lack of resistance does not constitute consent			2
the legislation says it 's also not consent if the person is drunk , drugged , unconscious or asleep			2
lawmakers say consent can be nonverbal , and universities with similar policies have outlined examples as maybe a nod of the head or moving in closer to the person			2
advocates for victims of sexual assault supported the change as one that will provide consistency across campuses and challenge the notion that victims must have resisted assault in order to have valid complaints			2
some critics say the legislation is overreaching and sends universities into murky , unfamiliar legal waters			0
speaking out : handmade signs decrying rape decorate tents set at an evening to raise awareness of sexual assault at @entity90 in @entity18 , which is one of the colleges affected by the bill @entity94 , an adviser to the @entity95 , wrote an editorial asking @entity15 not to sign the bill			1
he argued that ' this campus rape crusade bill ' presumes the guilt of the accused			0
' this is nice for the accusers — both false accusers as well as true accusers — but what about the due process rights of the accused , ' @entity94 wrote			0
the bill passed the state assembly on monday by a 52 - 16 vote			1
some republicans in that house questioned if statewide legislation is an appropriate venue to define consent			0
there was no opposition from @entity7 republicans			1
' this bill is very simple ; it just requires colleges to adopt policies concerning sexual assault , domestic violence , gang violence and stalking , ' said sen. @entity124 , @entity125			1
' they should have already been doing that			0
' the bill would apply to all @entity4 post-secondary schools , public and private , that receive state money for student financial aid			0
the @entity132 and @entity134 systems are backing the legislation after adopting similar consent standards this year			0
the bill also requires colleges and universities to adopt ' victim - centered ' sexual - assault response policies and implement comprehensive programs to prevent assault			1
in january , president @entity142 vowed to make the issue a priority			0
he announced a task force that created a website providing tips for filing complaints , www.notalone.gov , and issued a report in may naming 55 colleges and universities across the country facing investigation for their responses to sexual abuse and violence			0
the @entity134 , @entity158 was included on the list .			0

@entity7 unanimously passed bill that defines consent as ' an affirmative , conscious and voluntary agreement to engage in sexual activity '
governor @entity15 must now sign the bill into law by end of *september*
