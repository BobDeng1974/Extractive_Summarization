by @entity1 reporter published : 07:07 est , 9 december 2013 updated : 08:14 est , 9 december 2013 someone really ought to give these birds a heads up about their appearance if they 're ever going to find a mate			2
the bizarre photograph appears to show two king penguins decapitated on the @entity10 overseas territory of @entity11 , in the @entity12			1
in fact the shot is a trick of the lens as photographer @entity17 , 64 , reveals the birds thankfully just have their heads turned behind their backs preening themselves			1
he 's off his head ! the bizarre photograph appears to show two king penguins decapitated on the @entity10 overseas territory of @entity11 , in the @entity12 @entity17 , from @entity23 , took the picture during a trip to the remote island chain 2,500 miles from @entity27			1
@entity17 , a retired science teacher , said : ' i do a lot of travelling - almost always to see wildlife - partly because i enjoy it enormously but partly because i can find out about conservation issues at first hand and take relevant photographs for talks which i do on conservation			1
' i was with a group from the travel company @entity37 - it was a photographic charter using the @entity40 research ship @entity41 and we spent about four days around @entity11 before going on to @entity27			1
i had never been to either place before			0
' i was walking around on the beach at @entity45 - watching all the comings and goings of the penguins and fur seals			1
here 's how they should look : the @entity52 is the second largest species of penguin , weighing between 11kg and 16kg the @entity52 is the second largest species of penguin in the world , second only to the @entity58			0
mainly found in the @entity12 and the northernmost waters of the northern @entity27 , there are believed to be around 2.23million @entity52 and their numbers are increasing			0
from early spring , which falls in november , hundreds of thousands of @entity63 penguins descend on the beaches of the @entity12 to breed			2
known for being able to dive to extreme depths of more than 330 ft , they feed mostly on small fish and squid			0
they are also serially monogamous , remaining with one partner for an entire breeding cycle			0
king penguins make extraordinary parents			1
while one parent is guarding the chick , the other makes a trip of up to 250 miles in search of food			0
when the young are old enough , they are left with other juveniles so both parents can search for food			0
the adults return to the sea during the winter , leaving the chicks to survive on their own until they return			0
' this was our first landing on the island of @entity11 and my head was spinning with everything that was going on			1
' i did not really know which way to look or what to photograph			2
at one point , i just happened to be standing very close to the @entity101 professional photographer @entity100 when he spotted the two king penguins , about 15 metres away , with their heads behind their backs - almost certainly preening their back feathers			1
' @entity100 alerted me by just pointing at them and saying ' @entity17 , take that now ' they were only like that for a few seconds so i only had the chance of one shot			1
' at the time , i realised that it was a great photographic opportunity as the pair were well positioned on a ridge of shingle on the beach with nothing to distract in the background			2
' there are more @entity52 on @entity11 than anywhere else in the world			2
later on we went to @entity124 where there were just thousands and thousands			0
' @entity17 used a @entity126 with a 28 - 300 zoom lens to get the amazing picture			1
he said : ' the extraordinary thing is that i see penguins every day when i am home as my flat in @entity133 directly overlooks the penguin enclosure at @entity135			2
' i get a very good view of them from my kitchen window when i am washing up			0
the @entity135 penguins are all @entity140 penguins			0
they used to have a few kings but now specialise in the @entity140 ones			0

the photograph was taken by @entity17 on the isle of @entity11
it appears to show two decapitated king penguins *waddling* along a beach
but in fact they are preening themselves , their heads turned away from lens
