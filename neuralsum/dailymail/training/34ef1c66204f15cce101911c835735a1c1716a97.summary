school lunch directors say the 2017 target — 640 milligrams total in an elementary school lunch and 740 milligrams in a high school lunch — is n't feasible and say kids will reject the foods			2
@entity44 's @entity127 acknowledges the food industry is n't there yet but encourages frustrated school lunch directors to ' worry about today first before we imagine the worst down the road			2
' the standards require every student to take a fruit or vegetable to create a balanced plate			1
the reaction among students has been mixed			2

while many schools have already moved to make snacks healthier , others depend on snack money to help operate their lunchrooms and are worried about a sales dip			0
the @entity168 has asked @entity43 and @entity44 to only require that 50 percent of foods be whole grain - rich , to suspend the 2017 sodium requirements and to stop requiring students to take a fruit or vegetable			1
@entity174 , a nutrition lobbyist for the @entity175 who has pushed for healthier meals , says relaxing those standards could gut the program			0
' you ca n't call a meal a meal without a fruit or vegetable , ' she said			0
@entity44 has shown some flexibility already : in 2012 , the department scrapped maximums on proteins and grains after students complained they were hungry			1
@entity44 's @entity127 says problems will lessen as the food industry creates healthier products			0
' i 'll bet that five or seven years down the road , we 'll see kids eating healthy food and we 'll see acceptance , ' she said			0
@entity201 say they may intervene before then			0
@entity203 rep. @entity202 , the @entity201 in charge of the @entity206 spending committee overseeing @entity44 , has said school districts need a ' pause ' while problems are worked out			0
