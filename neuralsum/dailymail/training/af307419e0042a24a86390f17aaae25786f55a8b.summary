by @entity0 published : 12:01 est , 5 october 2013 updated : 16:05 est , 5 october 2013 a wealthy widow accused of killing her @entity3 tycoon husband inside their luxury @entity5 retreat in 2010 is now facing a new trial after her recent acquittal had been thrown out			1
@entity10 , @entity11 , was cleared of her husband @entity13 's murder last january , but a judicial panel recently overturned the verdict on appeal citing inconsistencies , setting the stage for a retrial			1
the benders moved to @entity5 in 1998 and spent four years building an elaborate secluded compound on 5,000 acres of land in the heart of the @entity5 jungle , complete with a circular glass house atop a mountain overlooking a 600 - foot waterfall			1
bad romance : @entity10 ( left ) faces a second trial in connection of the 2010 shooting death of her millionaire husband , @entity13 ( right ) , which she claims was the result of a suicide the couple 's dream of a peaceful life in a remote exotic locale came crashing down in january 2010 , when @entity40 , 44 , was found dead in his bedroom from a gunshot wound to the back of the head , the magazine @entity45 reported			1
@entity10 , then 39 years old , insisted from the outset that her husband - who much like her had suffered from manic depression for most of his life – killed himself			1
however , police investigating the murder were sceptical , and within weeks the woman had been charged with first - degree murder			1
@entity10 , a naturalized @entity54 citizen of @entity56 origin , went on trial january 14 , 2012 , testifying that at 12.15am on january 8 , 2010 , she woke up in her fourth - floor master bedroom to find her husband naked and holding a gun			1
according to the woman , when she attempted to wrestle away the pistol , it fired a bullet that struck @entity40 in the back of the head			2
' he told me that he was tired of living such a hard life with all that he had gone through , he said he was afraid of hurting someone , and that he believed that i was safer without him , ' the widow said in court , according to @entity73			0
brief reprieve : mrs @entity10 was acquitted last january of the murder , but the verdict was thrown out , with judges citing inconsistencies in the case the story of @entity13 and @entity10 's marriage reads like a pulp fiction novel packed with every trope of the genre : astounding wealth , tales of alleged diamond smuggling and bouts of madness set against the backdrop of a tropical paradise			1
as @entity45 reported in a lengthy profile in june , @entity92 met @entity40 , a brilliant yet troubled @entity3 investor , in march of 1998 in @entity95			0
from their first encounter , the couple bonded over their struggle with bipolar disorder and depression			2
mr @entity40 , the son of a high - ranking @entity103 official , ran several arbitrage funds and had a personal net worth upward of $ 600million			2
he was well on his way to becoming a billionaire when in 2000 he suffered a stroke			0
around the same time , the successful investor cashed out and decided to move to @entity5 , where he and his wife - both avid outdoorsmen and nature lovers - planned to create a sprawling ecological preserve			0
the couple settled in the remote jungle town of @entity117 , @entity118 , in @entity5 , where they purchased 5,000 acres of land for $ 10million			1
after renouncing their @entity54 citizenship and becoming permanent residents in their adoptive country , @entity13 and @entity10 got down to business of building the home of their dreams			0
four years and more than $ 2million later , the @entity129 were living in a breathtaking nine - room , five - story , 8,000 - square - foot glass mansion , which came with an elevator , helipad and moat			1
the benders ’ secure compound also boasted a sculpture garden and reflected pool stocked with fish			0
into the wild : the couple moved to @entity5 and bought a 5,000 - acre tract of land in the remote area of @entity117 in the jungle but the couple ’s seemingly idyllic life in a utopian setting also had its dark moments			1
@entity13 and @entity10 continued struggling with their demons and would administer homemade remedies to one another in hopes of getting a handle on their mental health problems			0
the wealthy expats also were not strangers to paranoia , which set in after a 2002 incident involving an armed man who fired on the @entity129 ’ compound			0
@entity40 went on a mission to fortify their property , which he stocked with a number of guns , including a pair of illegally purchased ak - 47s			0
the interior of the palatial home was lit with 550 @entity172 , and the house was crammed with over 3,000 diamonds , rubies , emeralds and sapphires worth $ 8.5million			2
when officials later came to seize property from the residence , they ended up hauling away four suitcases bursting at the seams with precious gems , which were too numerous to count			0
in a separate case , @entity10 was later accused of smuggling black - market gems – a charge she has vehemently denied			0
according to local reports , the millionairess had been suspected of bringing piles of jewels from @entity192 to sell them at exclusive auctions held at her home			0
after a week - long trial last january , a cost rican court acquitted mrs @entity10 , but the prosecution announced that it would appeal the verdict - a move that would not have been allowed under the @entity54 legal system , but is acceptable in @entity5			1
last month , a three - judge panel called for a new trial based on the assertion that the judges in the original trial had ignored a number of major discrepancies in the case , among them @entity40 's position at the time of death , which was said to be inconsistent with suicide , and lack of gunpowder residue on his hands			2
@entity10 has riled against the ruling , calling it a ' persecution ' against her and her dead husband .			2

@entity40 , 44 , was found dead in his fortified estate in 2010 from gunshot wound to back of the head
@entity10 , *42* , was acquitted of first - degree murder last january , but verdict was overturned on appeal
mrs @entity10 claimed her husband committed suicide after years of suffering from manic depression and bipolar disorder
benders built 8,000 - square - foot glass home on 5,000 acres of land in @entity5 jungle with moat and helipad
