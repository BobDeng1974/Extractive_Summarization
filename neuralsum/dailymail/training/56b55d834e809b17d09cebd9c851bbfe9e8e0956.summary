@entity1 was born in a ' perfect storm ' of bustling trade routes and migrant workers in 1920s central @entity5 , a study has claimed			0
scientists from @entity7 and @entity8 analysed the genetic history behind the virus , which killed 1.5million people last year alone , and painstakingly traced it back to the city of @entity14			1
now the capital of the @entity17 , @entity8 colonial rulers had made @entity14 a thriving trade hub with modern railways which allowed the virus to travel thousands of miles			1
melting pot : today 's @entity1 pandemic had its roots in 1920s @entity14 , a study has claimed			1
now the capital of the @entity17 , the city ( pictured in 1955 when it was called @entity14 ) had busy rail routes that combined with urban growth , migrant workers and changes to sexual habits and the sex trade , formed a ' perfect storm ' which allowed the virus to spread unnoticed until it was too late to stop it			1
the researchers combined genetic analysis with statistical data on historical factors , such as how the population of central @entity5 was distributed at the time			0
they focused on @entity41 , which was just one of several strains which were passed at some point from primates into humans			0
unlike the other strains , @entity1 - @entity47 proved more devastating , and is the strain which affects most of the 35million people affected around the world today			1
despite @entity14 being a melting - pot , @entity1 was seemingly slow to spread beyond the city 's borders			1
it took as long as 30 years for it to crop up in three other cities in the vast nation - @entity59 , @entity60 and @entity61 , as far as 1,000 miles away			0
how times change : @entity14 today			0
the virus has long since spread worldwide , killing up to 40million people it stayed in the @entity17 - which is the size of all of western @entity67 combined - until spreading to the @entity68 and around the world from the 1960s onwards , before the number of cases exploded in the 1980s			1
because @entity1 exists ' silently ' before causing acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( @entity73 ) , it was only identified as the virus behind the condition in 1983			2
by then thousands of people had already died of @entity73 - related illnesses			2
since then scientists have been engaged in a long battle to improve treatment with antiretroviral drugs , which slow the course of @entity1 and allow some patients to live healthily for decades			0
deadly : @entity1 seen in false colour through a microscope			0
only one strain turned into a pandemic thanks to their efforts and education about safe sex , @entity73 deaths have slowly been declining since 2005 - when they peaked at 2.3million worldwide - to 1.5million last year			2
professor @entity93 of @entity7 , a leader of the new study in the journal @entity96 , said it was the most comprehensive genetic analysis so far of @entity1			2
he said : ' for the first time , we have analysed all the available evidence using the latest phylogeographic techniques , which enable us to statistically estimate where a virus comes from			0
' this means we can say with a high degree of certainty where and when the @entity1 pandemic originated			2
' professor @entity108 of @entity8 's @entity109 said ' it became evident that the early spread of @entity1 - 1 from @entity14 to other population centres followed predictable patterns			1
' a key factor , he added , was the fact @entity8 colonisers had made @entity14 one of central @entity5 's best - connected cities			1
@entity120 of @entity7 added : ' data from colonial archives tells us that by the end of 1940s over one million people were traveling through @entity14 on the railways each year			1
' we think it is likely that the social changes around the independence in 1960 saw the virus break out from small groups of infected people to infect the wider population and eventually the world '			0
since the hiv / aids pandemic began it has killed up to 40million people around the world			0
it is spread in blood , semen and breast milk , often via unsafe sex or contaminated needles .			0

@entity7 and @entity8 scientists studied virus 's genetic history
they claim it originated in @entity14 , now the capital of the @entity17
city was well - connected with modern railways under @entity8 colonial rule
by 1950s , when first known case recorded , it had spread to three more cities
@entity1 , which causes @entity73 , only discovered in 1983 after pandemic took hold
35million people are now infected and 1.5 million died last year alone
