the news release says the agreement has been approved and signed by a high - ranking general overseeing the case			2
it says @entity12 will plead guilty to several other charges			1
new deal : army brigadier general @entity12 leaves the courthouse at @entity26 in @entity27 , @entity28 last week			1
a captain , whose sexual - assault allegations against @entity31 made him the focus of a rare court - martial for a high - ranking officer has had a plea deal accepted defense attorney @entity36 says in the news release that @entity12 is admitting to his mistakes and that it 's time to put the matter to rest			1
@entity12 was accused of twice forcing a female captain to perform oral sex on him during a three - year extramarital affair			1
the judge in case @entity46 @entity45 had last week declined to dismiss the charges outright			2
but he reviewed newly disclosed emails in @entity12 's case and said he found the appearance of ' unlawful command influence ' in @entity26 officials ' decision to reject a plea bargain with the general in january			2
the twist came with the @entity58 under heavy pressure from @entity60 and beyond to combat rape and other sex crimes in the military			2
under the military code of justice , the decision was supposed to be decided solely on the evidence , not its broader political implications			2
but @entity45 said the emails showed that the military officials who rejected the plea bargain had discussed a letter from the accuser 's lawyer			0
charges changed : lawyers representing @entity12 said that he will plead to lesser charges in exchange for having the sexual assault charges dropped along with two others that might have required @entity12 to register as a sex offender the letter warned that allowing the general to avoid trial would ' send the wrong signal			1
' @entity12 , 51 and the former deputy commander of the @entity88 , was accused of twice forcing a female captain to perform oral sex on him in @entity91 in 2011 during a three - year extramarital he has admitted to the affair but denied assaulting the woman			1

@entity12 is believed to be the highest - ranking @entity100 military officer court - martialed on sexual assault charges			1
the general ’s punishment will not be determined until a judge finishes holding the sentencing hearing			2
prosecutors are expected to argue for prison time , while defense lawyers will contend that officers in similar cases have not faced jail time and have been allowed to retire at reduced rank			0
accused : @entity12 , a 51 - year - old married father of two , is accused of twice forcing oral sex during a three - year affair he admitted to having with a junior female officer , including during deployments to @entity118 and @entity91 as one example , they cite the recent case of an @entity123 brigadier general who lost his command and paid a $ 5,000 fine but was allowed to keep his rank after it was determined he had assaulted a girlfriend and committed adultery			1
had prosecutors proceeded with the sexual assault charges , @entity31 would have faced the possibility of life in prison and permanent registration as a sex offender if convicted			1
defense lawyers also say @entity31 is willing to retire as a lieutenant colonel — two rungs below his current rank , and the last at which no illegal acts are alleged to have occurred — which would probably cost him more than $ 1 million in total retirement pay			0

the new guilty pleas expected to be entered monday include disobeying a commander ’s order not to contact his mistress , using demeaning language to refer to female officers and using a curse word when confronted about that conduct , and misusing his government travel charge card			1
even though the defense team appeared optimistic it could reach a deal , @entity36 said it might still be weeks before the case is resolved			2
it is now likely to happen far sooner			0
in december , @entity12 had offered to plead guilty to some of the lesser charges in exchange for the @entity123 dropping the sexual assault charges , but he was turned down			1
@entity12 's plea offer was discussed in emails among a high - ranking @entity187 - based @entity123 lawyer , the prosecutors and the commanding general overseeing the case			2
the judge said he does n't think the whole case was tainted , just the decision on a plea agreement			0
the judge also criticized prosecutors for not giving defense lawyers the emails sooner : ' the only reason we are in this conundrum is because of the government 's late notice			0
' rising star : @entity12 was once considered a rising star amongst military brass			0
his career is now likely to be over last week , @entity12 pleaded guilty to three lesser charges involving adultery with the captain and improper relationships with two other female @entity123 officers			1
those charges could bring 15 years in prison			0
a trial then began on the remaining sexual assault charges , with a potential sentence of life in prison			1
@entity12 's accuser came out against a plea bargain on the sexual assault charges in a december letter sent by her attorney , capt. @entity223			1
@entity223 suggested that the proposal deal would ' have an adverse effect on my client and the @entity123 's fight against sexual assault			1
' ' acceptance of this plea would send the wrong signal to those senior commanders who would prey on their subordinates by using their rank and position , thereby ensuring there will be other victims like my client in the future , ' @entity223 wrote			0
stand by your man : @entity12 's wife has stood with him throughout the many allegations of sexual wrongdoing though prosecutors deny any consideration was given to @entity223 's comments about the potential fallout , the emails turned over to the defense saturday show they did discuss her assertions			0
one top military lawyer at @entity26 quoted her letter and said he found @entity223 ' very preachy			0
' it was lt. gen. @entity258 , as commander of @entity26 , who made the final decision on whether to accept @entity12 's plea offer			0
testifying from @entity91 by telephone , @entity258 said monday that he did n't thoroughly read @entity223 's letter			0
the only thing he weighed in rejecting the deal was that the accuser wanted her day in court , he said			2
but @entity258 's testimony appeared to be contradicted by a december 20th email he sent to a military lawyer			0
' i have read the letter and made my decision , ' @entity258 wrote			0
@entity223 said last monday that the courtroom maneuvering over her letter was ' nothing more than an attempt to take the focus off the general 's gross misconduct			2

the army general prosecuted in the military ’s most closely watched sexual assault case has agreed to plead guilty to lesser charges in exchange for the dismissal of other accusations
the main accusation that has been dismissed is that he twice forced his *longtime* mistress into oral sex , threatened to kill her and her family
the new guilty pleas are expected to be entered by @entity11 . gen. @entity296 in military court on monday *morning*
the deal will now mean the @entity300 would no longer have to register as a sex offender
