by @entity0 for @entity1 it might be barking mad , but a @entity4 company has come up with an ingenious way of getting people to recycle and feed stray animals at the same time			1
@entity8 - the vending machine where you put the drinks bottles in , and out comes a portion of food for @entity15 's stray dogs and cats to gobble up			1
the profit made from the recycled bottles covers the cost of the pet food , so the machine works economically , while it is also super eco-friendly , as it runs off solar power			1
it is estimated that there are around 150,000 dogs alone without owners in the city			0
the station has two insertion holes , one for plastic bottles , metal soda cans and carton containers and one for the water which the plastic bottles may contain			0
when a plastic bottle or can is dropped into the hole the unit releases some food to the feeding container below , while the water that is poured down the separate hole goes directly to a container below for the animals to drink			1
good deeds : inventor @entity60 says the machine kills two bird with one stone , and is economically viable @entity60 , inventor of the machine , told @entity66 : ' my primary goal was to make people see that they do n't have to spend any money to help stray dogs			1
and i also wanted to show that people can do good deeds with things they would normally throw away			0
' at the same time , of course , i know that we do n't give much priority to recycling here in @entity4			2
in my opinion , this has to change			0
so i basically killed two birds with one stone			2
' it is manufactured by industrial company @entity83 group , who usually make steam boilers , but they were keen to buy into mr @entity60 's innovative project			2
there were fears among residents that these food boxes may lead to parts of the city being flocked with packs of hungry dogs , but that has not been the case , as all dogs have their own territory , which they do not leave for any long time , even for food			0
the project 's success has been noted all round the world			0
mr @entity60 says that 61 countries have expressed interest in having vending machines of their own , and they are being shipped out to 20 cities outside of @entity4 in the near future .			1
