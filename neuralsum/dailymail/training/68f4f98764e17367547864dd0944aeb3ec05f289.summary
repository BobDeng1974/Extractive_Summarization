by @entity0 published : 18:26 est , 17 april 2013 updated : 01:53 est , 18 april 2013 temporal power was given its customary rebuke			1
political obsequies always do this			1
under the vaults of some great church , sleek potentates gather , their fading predecessors a few rows back			1
then the coffin arrives — cold , clammy death — and all else dwindles			1
@entity12 , present and past , paraded at @entity13 ’s			2
we saw faces once familiar , now sunken and lined			2
this was @entity17 ’s ( as opposed to @entity18 ’s ) last hurrah			2
loyal to the last : @entity19 ( left ) had sided with mrs @entity20 against the rebels			1
@entity22 , @entity23 @entity24 stooped @entity25 and his ever - attendant @entity26 , a bespectacled @entity27			1
was there something lonely behind the old assassin ’s eyes ? but he was right to attend			1
@entity34 , nobly scarecrowish , braved his fraility to show respects to the woman he served as home secretary and more			1
trade ace @entity39 , her problem solver , was loyal to the end			2
he sat near @entity43 , who as @entity44 was with her at @entity46 in 1985			2
the front row went to the @entity48 and gallant prince @entity49			2
alongside them were our surviving prime ministers , come to salute a lost member of the club			1
@entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity20 have all now gone			1
run faster , my friends			2
history is catching up with us			2
we must elude it while we @entity63 , @entity64 , majors , @entity66 sat together			2
@entity68 's mouthpiece : formidable press secretary @entity69 @entity25 ( left ) , who savaged @entity20 in his @entity71 resignation speech in 1990 , and @entity27 , who challenged her for the @entity73 leadership @entity74 had tripped in all sparky - toothed , dressed elfin coquette			1
her outfit gave this funeral almost the look of a smart wedding			2
it was a day for tails ( @entity83 tidy in his ) and one or two top hats			2
under the brim of one enormous titfer trundled former speaker @entity87			2
now there is a @entity90 lady who knows how to behave			0
@entity92 ’s funeral dirge came blowing up @entity93 , through the cathedral ’s great west door , right down the waiting congregation ’s spine			1
the military spectacle was immense in its precision			0
colonel @entity100 , officer commanding , had done his stuff			0
the pallbearers reached the top of the cathedral steps and in that very instant all living ambition was subdued			0
@entity106 to @entity107 : ‘ we brought nothing into this world and it is certain we can carry nothing out			1
’ hear that , @entity112			0
boyish at 73 : @entity114 ( left )			0
@entity115 ( right ) made sure he stood out @entity117 ’s serving premier , @entity116 , had been parked near @entity119 ’s ex-pm , @entity120			1
between them was @entity123 ’s @entity122 , who with mrs @entity124 did much to undo the @entity127 empire			0
if anyone doubted @entity20 ’s global reach , here was proof			1
mr @entity122 can be excused not singing along to @entity131			0
which of us would be able to belt out @entity134 ? former @entity136 vice-president @entity135 looked unfamiliar with the tune to @entity138 , but he may just be a grunter			0
every congregation has a few			1
was that @entity143 ’s singing voice or was it the mighty @entity13 ’s organ parping its bottom bass b ? hard to say			0
white @entity146 ’s @entity145 was chewing something			0
gum ? biltong ? @entity150 ’s ex-pm , @entity149 , was there for the @entity151			0
still smooth : ex-cabinet minister @entity152 as he arrived at @entity153 alongside these world names were domestic political egos of old			1
sometime energy minister @entity156 looked distrait			0
@entity115 made sure he was noticed			0
@entity158 , still in the game but originally a @entity20 boy , pushed away a tear			1
@entity162 , always drawn to feisty women , seemed to be acting as walker to the @entity165			0
@entity166 , mrs t ’s last ( not entirely strong ) chief whip , was in the body of the kirk			0
@entity171 man : @entity173 ( left ) and long - serving cabinet minister @entity172 ( right ) that stoical walnut @entity19 lent enthusiastic voice during @entity177 ’s @entity176 , but when it came to the part ‘ there ’s no discouragement ’ was he perhaps tempted to tweak it to ‘ would make her once relent ’ ? the event had drawn not only her own side , such as ‘ @entity185 ’ former lord chancellor @entity186 , once - dashing @entity187 and sir @entity69 with his eyebrows			1
now there ’s a test for any @entity192 hedge trimmer			0
mourners had come from other parties , too			0
@entity195 and @entity196 , the one - time @entity197 duo who in their own way helped mrs t stay in power , were next to one another , paired for perpetuity			0
all ears : ( from left to right ) former prime minister @entity204 , @entity74 and prime minister @entity205 listen attentively during the funeral service of @entity20 compare and contrast : international development minister @entity209 decided to wear the full uniform of a member of the @entity212 , in stark contrast to @entity215 's crumpled navy blue suit differences aside : former political foes @entity216 and @entity218 put on friendly faces during the solemn occasion @entity216 and his wife @entity221 both wore black as a mark of respect to the former @entity73 leader leader of the @entity90 @entity83 with his barrister wife @entity226 joined a host of other politicians to pay their last respects gathered together : ( from left ) leader of the @entity90 @entity83 , deputy prime minister @entity232 and former prime minister @entity233 and @entity216 talked before the grand ceremony began @entity235 , who made his first speech for the @entity73 's aged 16 at their national conference , and wife @entity238 attended the coffin is presented in front of the 2,300 mourners within @entity153 great and the good : the entire @entity243 and dozens of senior politicians were among the mourners prime minister @entity205 and his wife @entity246 arrived for the service , joining world leaders and @entity20 's friends and relatives former prime ministers @entity204 and @entity233 with their wives @entity251 and @entity218 joined the @entity48 in the ceremony chancellor @entity255 and his wife @entity256 arrive ahead of the emotional service , where he and @entity205 shed a tear even @entity259 was there			1
@entity233 , at the end , gave him a chummy thumbs - up			0
@entity233 briefly seemed to think he was the host ! when the @entity265 gave that strong address about how @entity20 ’s ‘ no such thing as society ’ line had been misunderstood , what can @entity232 have felt ? he misquoted it to his own shifty purposes only the other day			1
the @entity273 ’s glories were nearing their conclusion			0
the archbishop of @entity276 , whose crisp @entity277 has something of a window cleaner reaching into every last crevice , gave his blessing			0
‘ the fever of life is over			0
’ those stalwart lads in @entity287 - @entity286 ’s bearer party marched back up the nave and resumed their burden			0
and as the coffin was carried out , to @entity292 ’s @entity291 , the @entity48 shot it a rueful , almost wary look			0
former conservative leader @entity295 , who helped minimise the @entity73 's rebellion against the poll tax when it was introduced , and wife @entity221 were among the hundreds of mourners the former chairman of @entity300 's and minister @entity299 , who famously resigned from @entity302 because he said his salary was n't enough to live on in @entity304 , arrived to pay his respects former conservative mp @entity306 ( centre ) and former @entity309 editor @entity308 ( left ) were smartly dressed as they joined dignitaries and world leaders for the funeral both clad in black , @entity48 and prince @entity49 stand outside @entity153			1
her majesty has only ever attended one other ' commoner ' funeral - that of sir @entity319 prime minister of canada @entity320 attended the funeral of the @entity20 , who has been praised as one of the @entity325 's great reformers @entity117 's prime minister @entity116 ( left ) and @entity119 's former prime minister @entity120 ( right ) were among the many foreign dignitaries who came former @entity136 secretary of state @entity143 waits for the start of the funeral service of @entity20 lord @entity331 , former mp and @entity333 medal winner , enters the cathedral with former government chief whip @entity335 @entity336 ( left ) arrives for the funeral service of @entity20 without his wife @entity338 , who reportedly refused to attend			1
he was joined by another mourner , deputy leader of the @entity341 @entity340 @entity342 , minister for government policy , chatted to fellow guests who were among 2,000 invited to the ceremony , including sir @entity346 and his wife @entity348 @entity196 , who served as @entity325 foreign secretary from 1977 to 1979 , and former mp @entity350 , attended the emotional ceremony that had many in tears			1
