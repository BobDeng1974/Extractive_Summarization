on the shore of @entity1 in @entity2 , @entity3 , stands an imposing villa built by a high - ranking government official , which played a mysterious role during the @entity8 as a secret refuge for defecting @entity11 spies			1
the luxury mansion called @entity13 is currently on the market for $ 749,000			1
it was built in the late 50s by @entity16 , a well - connected and cunning @entity17 official who counted among his friends presidents and kings			1
after moving to @entity20 in the 1970s , @entity16 rented his secluded , plush home to the @entity22 to be used as a safe house where so - called ‘ illegals ’ from the @entity25 were tucked away			1
the sale is being handled by realtors @entity65 and @entity66 , who thoroughly researched the property 's history			0
the most impressive part of the high - end home is its shadowy past			0
@entity72 is every inch the brainchild of its first owners , @entity16 , who served as @entity17 deputy chief of protocol between 1954 and 1957 , and his first wife , @entity79			2
the name of the mansion is an acronym combining the first few letters of the @entity84 ’ given names with ' @entity32 ' tacked on			0
during his years in the @entity17 , @entity16 , who by nature was charismatic , became known for his impressive connections that included foreign dignitaries and heads of state			0
the protocol official , then in his late 30s , came to know @entity47 and prince @entity93 while arranging their departure home after an official visit			1
he was even invited to stay in @entity99 in @entity100			0
fit for a king : @entity29 was originally a small lakeside log cabin called @entity103 , but mr @entity16 and his wife transformed it into a luxury lakefront retreat suitable for hosting foreign dignitaries ' p ' for perfect : the koi fish pond on the landscaped property in the shape of the letter ' p ' high and mighty : the luxury home was the setting for glamorous parties , one of which was attended by attorney general and later senator @entity52 out of sight : purse , who had connections in the government after his retirement , decided that his home was perfect to be used as a @entity126 safe house because it was secluded decades later , @entity47 would send purse a china set as a wedding gift and even embrace him in public during a reception			1
purse also became good friends with @entity46 's @entity45 , who invited him to go back with him to the @entity134 and stay in his palace			1
the deputy protocol chief ’s propensity for rubbing elbows with the high and mighty was irritating to his superior , protocol chief @entity139 , who grumbled about his deputy 's glamorous friends			1
the final straw for @entity139 came in 1957 , when then - 39 - year - old purse , who considered president @entity144 a father figure of sorts , was invited to fly from @entity147 to @entity49 on the presidential plane			0
after a public confrontation in the airport between @entity84 and his boss , who was forced to fly commercial , the deputy was ousted from the protocol office and transferred to an administrative position within the @entity17			0
two years later , @entity84 and his then - wife , @entity155 , were on the market for a lakefront home			0
the couple became interested in @entity2 , @entity3 , after hearing of a local real estate developer who was charged with murder			2
impressive setting : the formal dining room sitting six with a crystal chandelier over the dining table is overlooking @entity1 plenty of space : the 4,654 - square - foot @entity167 features a two - story great room with 18 - foot ceilings plush setting : the sun room is in the in - law suite accessible through the living room of the great house warm and toasty : the massive family room comes with heated blue slate stone floor perfect for cold @entity3 winters the opportunistic purse learned which properties the realtor , @entity179 , owned , and chose the best location , which at the time featured a one - room log cabin dubbed @entity103			1
the purses went to work expanding the small bungalow and turning it into a lavish mansion with 18 - foot ceilings where they could entertain their guests , among them @entity32 attorney general @entity52			2
the couple also added a patio , a pool , observation decks and a fountain with a large water wheel in the middle			2
after retiring from the @entity17 in the mid- 70s , mr @entity16 was living part time in @entity20 and decided to rent the secluded mansion hidden from view by high fences and neighboring homes to the @entity126			1
long - time residents of @entity2 still remember seeing @entity16 's shady tenants speaking a foreign language in the local country store			2
purse was kept in the dark about much of what was going on at @entity13 while it was being rented out by the @entity32 government			0
but he did reveal to @entity211 , who bought the mansion from him in 1983 , that he knew the identity of one of the @entity11 secret agents who called the lakefront estate home for a while			2
when asked if any other noteworthy house guests purse stated : ‘ @entity52 was out here once			0
that ’s all i can say about it			0
’ @entity29 changed hands twice since the 80s			0
it is currently owned by @entity225 and @entity226 , who had bought the house in 2002 from @entity228 , an international antiques dealer to celebrities , congressional members , movie stars , and millionaires .			1
