during an impromptu @entity1 a few days ago , @entity0 began reminiscing about his first @entity3 game way back in 2004			1
‘ i can not forget my first game against @entity5 and everyone was shouting “ @entity7 , @entity7 ” ( @entity8 ) and was not happy i play			0
’ that game , against @entity5 on august 15 , was @entity0 ’s debut and he kept a clean sheet , as he has done 158 times in the @entity14 since his arrival from @entity16 a decade ago			1
that gives an insight into his nature and his drive			0
it is no surprise he was behind the best defence in the @entity14 last season			1
they conceded just 27 goals			0
@entity47 , widely regarded as the best keeper in the world , conceded 23 as @entity50 romped to the @entity52 title			0
in @entity54 , where @entity28 kept goal for @entity56 in their title - winning season , the @entity53 conceded only 26			2
@entity28 can not be ignored after the decision was taken to finally bring the 22 - year - old keeper back to @entity62			2
now he has returned to @entity3 after three years on loan at the @entity65 , @entity0 ’s prospects look bleak			2
the reality is that @entity28 , with a @entity68 title and @entity70 final among his career highlights already , is @entity73 ’s preferred choice			1
a new @entity3 team is emerging , with @entity28 , @entity75 ( who was on the bench at @entity26 on monday evening ) , @entity77 and @entity78 munching goals up front			1
at 32 , with three @entity14 titles , the @entity70 in 2012 and @entity82 in 2013 , much will depend on whether @entity0 has the stomach for the fight			2
@entity73 has indicated , on a number of occasions , that he wants the @entity88 keeper to remain at @entity89			1
‘ we have two of the best keepers in the world , ’ he remarked after monday ’s 3 - 1 victory at @entity26			2
the new boy : cech on his @entity3 debut against @entity5 in august 2004 spectacular : the @entity88 keeper cemented his reputation in his early years at @entity3 with superb saves stretching the point : @entity0 tips away a shot from @entity105 's @entity104 in 2005 super saver : the best keepers , such as @entity0 , throw themselves around to keep the ball out foiling the best : the @entity3 keeper flies through the air to keep out @entity112 and @entity113 in the @entity114 taking no prisoners : @entity0 clatters into team - mate @entity25 as he clears the ball against @entity117 @entity118 future unclear joined in june 2004 from @entity16 for £ 7m 479 appearances for the club major honours 3 @entity14 titles ( 2004 – 05 , 2005 – 06 , 2009 – 10 ) 4 @entity124 ( 2006 – 07 , 2008 – 09 , 2009 – 10 , 2011 – 12 ) 2 @entity125 ( 2004 – 05 , 2006 – 07 ) @entity70 ( 2011 – 12 ) @entity82 ( 2012 – 13 ) @entity126 ( 2 ) : 2005 , 2009 individual honours 3 @entity128 ( 2004 – 05 , 2009 – 10 , 2013 - 14 ) 2 @entity129 ( 2004 – 05 , 2013 – 14 ) he is right , of course , but @entity0 ’s next game in the first team is likely to be in the third round of the @entity135 on september 23 or 24			1
he is a hugely popular member of the first - team squad at @entity3 and he has a special relationship with goalkeeper coach @entity138			2
the pair are often spotted out in @entity140 together , heading for the upscale eateries on @entity142 or @entity143			0
@entity138 , however , will have to adapt to the new set - up now that @entity28 has been given the chance to be @entity3 ’s first choice keeper			1
the @entity53 is the priority now			0
last weekend @entity149 manager @entity148 spoke of a new trend emerging , with the top teams staffing their squads with two high - end keepers			0
@entity154 brought in @entity155 to compete with @entity156 over the summer ; @entity157 signed @entity159 keeper @entity158 from @entity160 to fight it out with @entity161 ; @entity162 has signed for @entity50 , but will rarely get a game ; @entity165 keeper @entity164 joined @entity166 and will vie with captain @entity167 for a spot			0
the highs : @entity0 ( front centre ) shows his elation at winning the @entity14 in 2005 with @entity3 cup of joy : @entity0 celebrates beating @entity173 in the 2009 @entity175 final spot on : @entity0 saves @entity177 's penalty on the way to @entity70 glory kings of @entity181 : the keeper lifts ' @entity182 ' on that night in @entity184 in 2012 not second rate : the @entity88 no 1 shows his joy at winning the @entity82 last year the problem is that no top keeper is ever satisfied with life on the substitutes bench			1
@entity193 won five @entity195 titles with @entity196 and the @entity70 under @entity73 in 2010 , but was n’t willing to play second fiddle to @entity198			2
burning £ 70,000 a week in wages , he spent some time in @entity200 with @entity201 last season and joined @entity203 on a two - year deal on tuesday			0
leaving @entity3 is an option for @entity0 and @entity73 will not stand in his way if he decides to go			1
@entity3 ’s manager hinted at some ‘ offers ’ after their victory at @entity21 , but @entity0 is reluctant to accept that his days at the @entity89 are over			1
sickening blow : @entity0 is caught by @entity212 in 2006 , leading to him being taken to hospital ( below ) beaten to the punch : @entity215 ( centre ) beats @entity0 to win the 2008 @entity135 for @entity217 he is a dedicated professional , a man who never drinks alcohol and always respects the club ’s code of conduct			1
his time - keeping is immaculate			0
like every keeper he has made mistakes throughout his career , but he remains one of the best in the business			0
that ’s why , on sunday , when he travelled with the squad to @entity230 he look frustrated and fed up			0
he knew his fate by then			0
if he decides to leave , he will be remembered as a @entity3 great			0
what now ? @entity0 is facing a future as @entity3 's @entity135 keeper ... unless he leaves			1

@entity0 was on the bench as @entity28 started against @entity21
the @entity88 keeper has been first - choice since his @entity3 debut in 2004
@entity28 is now no 1 for @entity73
@entity3 had the *meanest* defence in the @entity14 last season
@entity0 is a model professional and well - liked at @entity89
his next start may well be in the @entity135 in late september
