what is the special quality that makes a house a home ? often , that elusive ' something ' has its origins in our memories			1
this month , a survey of 2,000 new homeowners found more than half felt dissatisfied			0
but while few first - timers can afford the house of their dreams , the discontent seemed to be caused as much by emotional factors as by more practical considerations			1
a common complaint was that their new property did n't ' feel like home ' , while a quarter admitted they still refer to their parents ' house as ' home '			1
@entity27 and son @entity26 which was built in the 1480s and is a @entity31 hall house it was clear that many felt the absence of something intangible - the comforting atmosphere of the place in which they spent their childhood			1
but what is it really like to return , as an adult , to the house where you grew up ? i 'm writing this article in a room that was built before @entity48 reached @entity49			1
it 's a gusty autumn day ; the wind mews in the chimney , the logs shift and sigh in the grate			1
for centuries , other people have heard these same sounds in this same room			1
and everything - from the scent of woodsmoke , to the nubbly texture of my great - grandmother 's woven curtains , to the deep caramel colour of the never ‑ since redecorated walls - is familiar to me from my earliest childhood			1
i live , you see , in the family house in rural @entity71 where i grew up			1
@entity27 says she loves the thought that for centuries , other people have heard the same sounds in the same rooms that she lives in with her family in my 20s i lived in @entity79 , but when my eldest son , @entity80 , now 24 , was a baby , i moved back , and i 've been here ever since			1
of my life so far , only about one - fifth has been spent elsewhere , a percentage that shrinks with every passing year			0
i 've been shaped by this house , @entity84 , to an unusual degree			1
and i consider myself lucky			0
i feel connected not only to my own past , but to the past of those who 've lived here before me - and as the house is more than 500 years old , that ’s a lot of ( benign ) ghosts			1
@entity27 says she loves the way the house feels at one with the landscape			1
only about one - fifth of her life has been spent elsewhere			0
i feel pleasantly rooted in an area i know well			1
this continuity , i believe , also provides a sense of security for my three sons			1
two of them have autism , so for them , the stability that comes from familiarity is doubly important			1
others might feel stuck , or confined , by this arrangement , but i do n't			0
the interplay between the history of the house and our present lives never ceases to fascinate me			1
i even wrote a book about it			0
@entity84 , built in the 1480s , is a @entity31 hall house - a type of old timber - framed structure often found in the @entity121			1
the passing generations have added or subtracted bits here and there , but in essence , it is still the same unplanned mound of brick and timber it always was			0
it 's entirely constructed of materials from within a five - mile radius : oak beams , clay tiles , locally forged ironwork , plaster mixed with the chopped red ‑ brown hair of @entity139 cattle			1
you can see this hair in the many places where childish exuberance has punched holes in the softly bulging walls			0
i love the way the house feels at one with the landscape , a russet - coloured mound rising up amidst the tussocky pattern of small hills , small woods , small fields			1
outside , the garden - defined by crumbling walls - merges with the farmyard			0
a barn , a dairy , a brewhouse and stables stand in dilapidated testimony to the semi-self - sufficiency of the lives of our forebears			1
the house came into my family in 1888			1
if you do n't move house , there 's less incentive to clear things out , and , besides , i come from a proud race of clutterers			1
if my great - grandparents came back from the dead , they 'd find that remarkably little had changed			0
true , we do have electric light , we do n't draw our water from the 70ft brick - built well outside the kitchen door and the coach - house shelters lawnmowers and power tools instead of pony - traps			1
@entity27 knows the area well and says it provides a sense of security for her three sons , two of whom have autism @entity84 pictured in 1909			1
the house came to @entity27 's family in 1888 and most of its features still remain the same but inside and out , they 'd recognise a great deal			1
furniture , window frames , latches , door handles , kitchen utensils , even some of the carpets and curtains have remained			2
lifestyle features and tv programmes show us perfectly decorated living rooms , immaculately functional bathrooms , streamlined kitchens			2
but all these tempting images appeal to one sense only - sight			2
and a home is n't just something to be looked at			0
sounds , smells and textures can not be experienced on a screen or between the pages of a magazine , however glossy			0
our early experience of home is conveyed to us through all our senses ; on an unconscious level , this never leaves us			0
view from the kitchen garden wall of the house outside , i can hear the swish of 21st - century traffic			2
inside , the washing machine is shrieking at me to tell me it 's finished its load			2
but the sheep bleating in the barn , the squeaking of the pine trees as they rub their branches together in the wind , form a timeless aural tapestry - rarely consciously noticed - linking my present to my past , and to the lives of so many before me			1
i am aware that i live in a highly unusual house			2
would i feel so strongly if i had grown up somewhere less special ? perhaps			0
@entity244 , my partner , moved into a newly built bungalow in a village near @entity247 when he was a toddler			2
seven @entity248 was ' utterly ordinary ' , he says			0
but , nonetheless , its particular atmosphere defined his @entity252 childhood			0
after little more than half a century , his memories feel ' historical ' : ' there was one bunker for coal , for the sitting room fire and another for coke for the kitchen boiler			0
' there was no central heating			0
the bedroom he shared with his brother had been intended as a garage , so was built with only a single layer of bricks and faced north - east ; curtains glued to the window by frost were the norm for several months of the year			2
today , almost every aspect of seven @entity248 has changed			0
the brick is covered with pink render , the small front lawn and rosebed have been paved over for parking and a loft extension means it is n't really even a bungalow any more			0
nothing is left of the whiff of @entity281 that permeated @entity244 's childhood			2
that 's not particularly to be regretted , but the point is that those early experiences - the @entity286 , the coke , the gravel path , the cork bath mat - still exist in his mind as highly potent memories			2
' i even have this slight fondness for @entity247 , ' he says , ' but i realise it 's not particularly rational			2
' @entity27 at the house with her mum and older brother emotion and rationality - surely this is where our ideas about ' home ' , as opposed to choices about ' property ' , clash ? unfortunately , modern economics oblige most people to conflate the two			1
the first home bought by a young couple will almost never be the last			0
it probably wo n't even be where they bring up their children			0
for the majority , the dwelling place is by far their most valuable asset			0
we are encouraged to increase its value by adding bathrooms , conservatories and the like			0
it 's not fashionable to leave things as they are			2
when the time is ripe , the place is put back on the market ; the modern way is to move house every few years			2
but while that may all make sound financial sense , is it really compatible with the idea of home ? the dissatisfaction of those first - timers in the survey is unsurprising			2
' home ' is something that grows over time			0
there 's no instant fix , whatever the magazines tell us			2
it 's about those early years , when all the imprinting is done			0
but i 've some comfort for the young parents still secretly pining after their own childhood homes : they are , simultaneously , creating a similar , equally precious , set of memories for their own children			0
my son @entity80 expresses - with autistic directness - the sentiments that many of us feel			0
every day he tells us : ' i want to stay here , in the kitchen at @entity364 , all days , all weeks			0
' that makes perfect sense to me			0
@entity84 : a @entity367 and a family , by @entity369 , is published by @entity370 .			1
