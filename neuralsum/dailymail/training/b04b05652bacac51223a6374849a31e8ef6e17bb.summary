in 200 million years the @entity0 will look very different , with the latest research predicting that a supercontinent called @entity3 will form right over the @entity4 , and not over the centre of @entity6 , as previously thought			1
@entity7 will crunch together , with the @entity9 and @entity10 disappearing , while @entity11 will join the @entity7 , according to a study by @entity14 scientists			2
‘ after those water bodies close , we ’re on our way to the next supercontinent , ’ said lead researcher @entity15			1
‘ you ’d have the @entity7 meeting @entity21 practically at the @entity4			2
the @entity14 researchers used a process called orthoversion to arrive at their conclusions			0
according to this , each succeeding supercontinent forms 90 degrees from the geographic centre of its ancient predecessor			1
the new theory contrasts with the standard theories about supercontinent formation , introversion and extroversion , which hold that supercontinents form either 0 or 180 degrees away from the geographic centre of the previous supercontinent			1
under these earlier theories , the @entity49 will disappear and the next supercontinent will form with a centre more or less in the same spot as the last supercontinent ’s centre , present - day @entity6			1
alternately , the @entity56 will disappear and the next supercontinent will form with a centre on the opposite side of the globe			1
@entity15 and colleagues arrived at the new theory after an extensive analysis of the magnetism of ancient rocks			0
after each historical supercontinent assembled , it underwent a series of back - and - forth rotations around a stable axis along the equator			1
from one supercontinent to the next , the axes were offset from each other by about 90 degrees , the @entity14 team showed - consistent with orthoversion , but not with either introversion or extroversion			2
‘ this kind of analysis gives us a way to arrange continents in both latitude and longitude , providing a better understanding in patterns of biological dispersal and the dynamics of @entity0 's deep interior , ’ said @entity14 doctoral student @entity77 , the study ’s second author			0
the most recent supercontinent , @entity91 ( which is @entity92 for ‘ @entity93 ’ ) , formed about 300 million years ago with @entity6 at its centre			1
it began breaking apart into the seven continents of today with the birth of the @entity49 about 100 million years later			0
researchers believe @entity91 is the third or fourth supercontinent in @entity0 ’s history			2
its immediate predecessors were @entity103 - which formed about 1 billion years ago - and @entity105 , which formed about 1.8 billion years ago			0
the idea of continental drift was introduced by @entity110 scientist @entity109 in 1912 , to explain how the shape of @entity0 ’s countries looked suspiciously like jigsaw pieces that would fit together			0
the @entity0 ’s surface is formed from seven major and several minor tectonic plates that wander around at speeds varying from a few millimetres to two centimetres a year , the same pace that a human nail grows			0
it ’s the friction caused by plates grinding against each other that causes earthquakes .			0

it was previously thought that the next supercontinent would form over the centre of @entity6
