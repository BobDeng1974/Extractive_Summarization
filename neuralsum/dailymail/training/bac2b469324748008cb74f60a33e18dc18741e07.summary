an audit by big four accountancy firm @entity42 , launched in may , alleged that overcharging began at least as far back as the start of the current contracts in 2005			1
mr @entity14 said : ' from the outset i made clear that i intended to take robust action to deal with evidence of unacceptable conduct by suppliers under my department ’s contracts , and to recover any monies overpaid as a result of these practices			2
' he went on : ' unlike @entity4 , @entity20 has not yet agreed a position on repayment			0
however , discussions are ongoing and i remain determined to pursue all legal options to recover the taxpayer ’s money			0
' while it is evident that both suppliers ’ conduct under these contracts has been wholly unacceptable , i made clear in my statement in july that my department had been found wanting in its management of the electronic monitoring contracts			0
' justice secretary @entity14 has called in rival firm @entity70 to run carry out the work on an interim basis the @entity74 - based security firm traces its roots back to a guarding company founded in @entity77 in 1901			0
@entity20 was formed when @entity20 merged with @entity78 in 2004			0
the company has a long record of blunders including : in 1993 @entity20 became the first private company to run prisoner escort services , m and lost seven inmates in three weeks a year later a hunger striker escaped from @entity86 detention centre , guarded by @entity20 in 1997 it emerged the firm had transferred a prisoner between two vans on a petrol station forecourt three prisoners escaped from @entity93 in 2001 in 2011 , @entity20 staff lost a set of cell keys just days after taking over @entity97 put an electronic tag on criminal @entity100 's artificial limb in 2012 the firm failed to train enough guards for the @entity103 which meant 3,500 soldiers had to be recalled from leave in march this year a @entity20 guard at @entity107 ordered @entity109 engineer @entity108 to change out of her uniform before flying to the @entity111 because it was ' offensive ' @entity112 , minister for the @entity113 , which led the broader review of @entity4 and @entity20 contracts , said : ' it 's good news for taxpayers that @entity4 has agreed to recompense £ 68.5 million for overcharging			0
' we are confident that the company is taking steps to address the issues which our review has identified			0
' since day one this government has been working to reform contract management and improve commercial expertise in @entity128			1
' @entity129 , chief procurement officer for the government , who led the review , said : ' opening up public services to a diverse range of suppliers means that we can access the innovation that the public sector , private companies and the voluntary sectors can bring			1
' we need the very best commercial skills to be able to make the most of these opportunities and we know that these skills are not yet strong enough across @entity130			0
' the government launched a review of all contracts with @entity20 and @entity4 signed by every government department after doubts were raised about the use of taxpayers ’ money			1
the scandal could date back as far as 1999 , when tagging of criminals began in @entity153 and @entity154			1
since then the taxpayer has spent £ 1billion on tagging and monitoring offenders			1
the current contracts began in 2005			0
in some cases private contractors charged the government for years after tagging had stopped and cases included being charged for tags for dead people			1
@entity20 has apologised and offered to repay £ 24.1 million			0
a spokesman said it accepted it ‘ wrongly considered itself to be contractually entitled to bill for monitoring services when equipment had not been fitted or after it had been removed ’			0
the company insisted an independent review it commissioned ‘ has not identified any evidence of dishonesty or criminal conduct by any employee ’			0
but the @entity8 made clear that the government would not accept the voluntary offer			2
a @entity178 report into the electronic monitoring contracts found evidence the firms were charging for multiple tags on individual criminals			2
in one case @entity4 charged more than £ 15,000 for monitoring an offender whose home was not even fitted with the equipment .			0
