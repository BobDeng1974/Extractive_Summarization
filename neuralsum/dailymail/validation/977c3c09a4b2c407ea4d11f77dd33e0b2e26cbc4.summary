president @entity0 challenged republicans who oppose @entity2 to come up with an alternative at an event today celebrating the fifth anniversary of the law			1
in a subtle jab at @entity10 presidential candidate @entity9 , who has zealously fought to repeal the @entity2 , @entity0 said , ' folks who are basing their entire political agenda on repealing the law , you ’ve got to explain how kicking millions of families off their insurance is somehow going to make us more free			1
' @entity9 led a 2013 filibuster in the @entity18 that he hoped would result in a successful vote to defund the health care reform law , making it easier to legislatively dismantle			1
to ' folks who are basing their entire political agenda on repealing the law , ' he said , ' you ’ve got to explain how kicking millions of families off their insurance is somehow going to make us more free ' he and his allies were eventually defeated in that effort after a two - week stand off with @entity35 , who held the majority in the upper chamber at the time			1
but he has continued to fight to have the law nullified and named repeal a top priority in a speech announcing his candidacy for higher office on monday			1
the @entity46 was wo n't to react that afternoon to @entity9 's entry into the 2016 brawl but it did rib him over his campaign promise to throw out the sitting president 's signature policy achievement			1
' well , there was a presidential candidate who ran in 2012 promising to repeal the @entity2 , and that campaign pledge did n’t work out very well for him , ' @entity0 's spokesman , @entity52 , told reporters , referring to that year 's @entity10 nominee for president , @entity58			1
in a twist of irony , @entity9 said tuesday that he would sign his family up for @entity2			1
previously included in a plan in the name of his wife , a @entity65 employee , @entity9 's family will lose its health care soon as she leaves her job to join him full time on the campaign trail			1
@entity52 resisted taking a shot at @entity9 over the matter on wednesday , saying that if he does apply for a plan via the government marketplace , ' he will find is what millions of @entity74 across the country have found , ' which is that there are good quality healthcare plans available because of the health care reform law			1
while others have pointed out the irony of the situation , ' i am seeking to merely point out the common experience that it seems that the @entity9 family may be sharing , ' @entity52 told a reporter pressing him on the issue			2
at the event on wednesday , @entity0 said critics of the law need to explain ' why forcing millions of families to pay thousands of dollars more will somehow make us more secure			1
or why we should go back to the days when women paid more for coverage than men ' and a ' preexisting condition locked so many of us out of insurance			2
' the president said that because of the law , ' if you ’re a woman , you can no longer be charged more just for being a woman			2
' and you know there are a lot of women			0
like more than 50 percent , ' he said , eliciting laughter from attendees of the @entity46 - sponsored event for private and public sector health care workers			0
' this law is also saving lives - lives that touch all of us , ' he said			2
' it ’s working despite countless attempts to repeal , undermine , defund , and defame this law			2
' defending the @entity2 , commonly called @entity2 after its biggest backer , the president , @entity0 said , ' it ’s not the “ job - killer ” that critics have warned about for five years			1
' in fact , after it was passed , ' businesses began the longest streak of private - sector job growth on record , ' he said , noting that the economy has added 12 million new jobs in the last 60 months			0
' it ’s not the fiscal disaster critics warned about for five years			2
health care prices are rising at the slowest rate in nearly 50 years , which has helped cut our deficit by two - thirds since i took office , ' he contended			0
before the @entity2 went into effect , health care costs were projected to be the ' single biggest driver ' of new deficits			2
' today , health care is the single biggest factor driving those projections down , ' he said			0
' we have been promised a lot of things these past five years that did n’t turn out to be the case : death panels , doom			0
a serious alternative from @entity10 in @entity156 , ' he said			2
the comment was a subtle jab at @entity10 presidential candidate @entity9 , who has zealously fought to repeal the @entity2			1
@entity9 , pictured here on monday at his campaign kick off , led a 2013 filibuster in the @entity18 that he hoped would result in a successful vote to defund the health care reform law , making it easier to legislatively dismantle @entity0 said the reason that @entity10 are having such a difficult time coming up with an alternative to his plan to reform the healthcare system is because it was ' pretty much was their plan before i adopted it			1
' repeating past claims , @entity0 said the @entity2 is ' based on conservative , market - based principles developed by the @entity174 and supported by @entity10 in @entity156 , and deployed by a guy named @entity58 in @entity176 to great effect			1
' if they want to take credit for this law , they can			0
i ’m happy to share it , ' he added			0
the president acknowledged that his administration has ' made our share of mistakes since we passed this law			1
' ' but we also know beyond a shred of a doubt that the policy has worked , ' he said			0
cost growth is at a historic low			0
' ' so if anybody wants to join us in the spirit of the people who have put aside differences to come here today and help make the law work even better , come on board , ' he said , trolling @entity10			1
to @entity10 lawmakers who want to get rid of the law , he pointed to 28 - year - old @entity2 recipient @entity208 , a @entity209 business owner who was present for his remarks , made from the @entity212 of the @entity213 , which is located next door to the @entity46			1
' she thought what many of us think when we 're young ... that she was too young , too healthy to bother with health insurance			0
she went to the gym every day			0
she ate healthy , looks great , felt invincible			0
why pay a doctor just to tell her she ’s okay ? ' @entity208 bought healthcare insurance from the federal marketplace that was created by @entity2 at the behest of her mother , he said			1
and four months later she was diagnosed with stomach cancer , for which she underwent chemo therapy and surgery			0
' today , she ’s recovering			0
she ’s here with us at the @entity230			0
she invited me to her wedding , ' he said			0
' i told her you do n't want the president at her wedding			0
' because @entity208 was covered under @entity2 and had her cancer diagnosed early , he said , she is now healthy and will be able to follow through with a september wedding to her fiancé @entity239			2
' and she ’s convinced him to get covered , too , ' @entity0 stated			0
the president said he and first lady @entity241 appreciated @entity208 's invitation to her wedding , but ' as i said , we have to mag people at the wedding , and it spoils the fun			0
