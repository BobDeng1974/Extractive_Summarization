by @entity0 they were once believed to be impervious to fire , but it appears that increasing temperatures are having a shrinking effect on salamanders			1
wild salamanders in @entity8 are getting smaller as their surroundings get warmer and drier , forcing them to burn more energy in a hotter climate			1
researchers from the @entity14 found that salamanders in the @entity16 today were nearly a tenth smaller than their ancestors in the @entity18			1
shrinking species : this northern gray - cheeked salamander , @entity20 , is one of the @entity23 salamander species that has gotten significantly smaller in recent decades as the habitat around it warms the changes were most marked in the @entity16 and at low elevations â € “ settings where detailed weather records showed the climate has warmed and dried out most			1
scientists have predicted that some animals will get smaller in response to climate change and , the researchers sasy , this is strong confirmation of that prediction			1
senior author @entity37 , associate professor of biology at @entity14 , said : ' this is one of the largest and fastest rates of change ever recorded in any animal			0
' we do n't know exactly how or why it 's happening , but our data show it is clearly correlated with climate change			0
' and , she added , it 's happening at a time when salamanders and other amphibians are in distress , with some species going extinct and others dwindling in number			1
prof lips when on : ' we do n't know if this is a genetic change or a sign that the animals are flexible enough to adjust to new conditions			0
' if these animals are adjusting , it gives us hope that some species are going to be able to keep up with climate change			0
' research assistant @entity66 measures a salamander while associate professor @entity37 takes notes during field work for the study of @entity23 salamanders			1
the animals are shrinking 1 percent per generation the study was prompted by the work of @entity14 professor @entity76 , who began collecting salamanders in the @entity23 in 1957			1
the ancient mountain range 's moist forests and long evolutionary history make it a global hot spot for a variety of salamander species			0
prof @entity76 collected hundreds of thousands of salamanders , now preserved in jars at the @entity88 's @entity87 in @entity89 , @entity14			1
but his records show a mysterious decline in the region 's salamander populations beginning in the @entity94			0
prof lips , an amphibian expert , saw a similar decline in the frogs she studied in @entity99 , and tracked it to a lethal fungal disease			0
she decided to see whether disease might explain the salamander declines in the @entity16			0
prof @entity37 and her students measured and took dna samples from salamanders at 78 of prof @entity108 's collecting sites in @entity14 , @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity111 and @entity112 , between summer 2011 and spring 2012			2
they found virtually no fungal disease in the museum specimens or the living animals			0
but when they compared size measurements of the older specimens with today 's wild salamanders , the differences were striking			2
between 1957 and 2012 , six salamander species got significantly smaller , while only one got slightly larger			2
on average , each generation was 1 per cent smaller than its parents ' generation , the researchers found			1
the researchers compared changes in body size to the animals ' location and their sites ' elevation , temperature and rainfall			2
they found the salamanders shrank the most at southerly sites , where temperatures rose and rainfall decreased over the 55 - year study			2
a researcher bags a red backed salamander , @entity142 , prior to swabbing it , measuring it , and releasing it			0
next , researchers will study whether smaller size is a useful adaptation to climate change to find out how climate change affected the animals , @entity151 biologist @entity150 used a computer program to create an artificial salamander , which allowed him to estimate a typical salamander 's daily activity and the number of calories it burned			1
using detailed weather records for the study sites , dr @entity150 was able to simulate the minute - by - minute behavior of individual salamanders , based on weather conditions at their home sites during their lifetimes			1
the simulation showed the modern salamanders were just as active as their forbears had been			2
but to maintain that activity , they had to burn 7 to 8 per cent more energy			1
cold - blooded animals ' metabolisms speed up as temperatures rise , dr @entity150 explained			0
to get that extra energy , salamanders must make trade - offs , said prof lips			1
they may spend more time foraging for food or resting in cool ponds , and less time hunting for mates			0
the smaller animals may have fewer young , and may be more easily picked off by predators			2
' right now we do n't know what this means for the animals , ' said prof lips			0
' if they can start breeding smaller , at a younger age , that might be the best way to adapt to this warmer , drier world			0
' or it may be tied in with the losses of some of these species			0

@entity23 salamanders are nearly a tenth smaller than 50 years *ago*
researchers say they are shrinking by about 1 per cent per generation
hotter climes mean they have to burn more energy to maintain activity
