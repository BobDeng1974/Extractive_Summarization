he did not provide further details			0
@entity16 will decide disciplinary measures for the officers , who were assigned to non-field duties during an @entity26 investigation			1
possible measures could include extensive retraining , suspensions or even firings			2
out of policy : police chief @entity16 will determine how to best punish the eight officers the panel found to be out of policy at a news conference , @entity16 said he could n't comment on what discipline the officers may receive because their information is private under state law			1
he said ' these officers will all and have all received extensive training as had the whole @entity26 relative to these types of issues			2
' @entity46 spokesman @entity45 said the union 's president , @entity47 , was waiting to review the commission 's report before providing comment			0
last year , the city paid the women $ 4.2 million to settle a claim			1
that was in addition to a separate $ 40,000 settlement for the loss of their truck			2
the @entity18 's determination did n't surprise the women 's attorney , @entity62			0
@entity64 reached : the city of @entity6 has agreed to pay @entity66 ( left ) and her mother , @entity67 ( right ) , $ 4.2million after the women were shot in february during a manhunt for @entity12 mistaken identity : @entity26 officers fired at least 100 rounds at the delivery women 's @entity73 without warning after mistaking it for @entity12 's pickup ' there ( are ) 4.2 million reasons i have to believe it 's out of policy , ' he said			1
' anyone with any common sense would agree it 's out of policy			0
' @entity12 , a fired @entity6 police officer , claimed he was unfairly dismissed and vowed revenge against law enforcement officers in a rambling online manifesto			1
he killed the daughter of a former @entity26 police official along with her fiance and two law enforcement officers over 10 days before being cornered and killing himself in a burning mountain cabin in @entity96			1
on feb. 7 , 2013 , @entity6 police guarding the @entity99 home of a high - profile target named in @entity12 's manifesto opened fire on a pickup truck they thought was @entity12 's			1
compromise : @entity6 city attorney @entity105 , right , stands with @entity62 , attorney for the two injured women , during a news conference to announce a city settlement with @entity66 and @entity67 v for victory : @entity62 called the settlement amount fair and said it possibly spared the city as much as $ 15million it actually contained the two women delivering newspapers			1
' this was a tragic cascade of circumstances that led to an inaccurate conclusion by the officers , ' the police chief said			2
the officers had earlier learned that the target 's wife recently had seen @entity12 in the neighborhood appearing to case the location , and just prior to the shooting officers heard over police radio that @entity12 was getting off the freeway nearby , @entity16 said			1

' @entity16 said officers opened fire immediately after one woman threw a newspaper and an officer mistook the sound of it hitting the pavement for gunfire			2
' there is no evidence to support that they were holding an object that could be reasonably perceived to be an imminent deadly threat , ' @entity16 wrote in his report			0
he said an officer with similar training and experience would not reasonably perceive a deadly threat in the same situation			0
' i sympathize with the officers , but i have a very high standard for the application of deadly force , and the shooting did not meet that standard , ' he said tuesday			0

' ' the emotional and mental trauma is still there and they 're still dealing with that , ' he said			0
the shooting occurred hours after @entity12 opened fire with an assault rifle on two @entity6 police officers who had stopped his pickup in the @entity217 city of @entity218			1
during the resulting gun battle , one officer was grazed and the other was sprayed with shattered glass			0
@entity223 fled and a short time later shot two @entity217 police officers , killing one			2

' as in all use of force incidents , the department has completed a thorough review and will adopt the lessons learned , both good and bad from these incidents			0
' @entity14 said the @entity18 followed @entity16 's recommendation that the lethal use of force in @entity99 was out of policy , making its determination after nearly three hours of discussion and months of investigation by the @entity247			0
the same day that the women 's pickup was shot up in @entity99 , a police officer in that @entity6 suburb opened fire on another pickup truck			1

@entity263 has not been disciplined by his agency			0
@entity265 , of @entity266 , who was on his way to surf , was n't shot but he suffered head and spinal injuries			0
