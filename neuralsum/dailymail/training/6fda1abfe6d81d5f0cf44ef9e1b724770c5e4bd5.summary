a huge painting of an impossibly slim and sexy woman , spread - eagled and completely naked , greets visitors to diet guru @entity4 ’s beautifully - appointed consulting room in an expensive @entity6 neighbourhood			1
not exactly what one expects in your average doctor ’s surgery , but the implication is clear : believe in me and miracles can happen			0
in the grand tradition of the travelling snake - oil salesman , @entity4 sells dreams and - until this month when he was hit by a damning @entity18 official report branding him deceitful and unethical — he has done so hugely successfully			1
discredited : nutritionist and dietitian dr @entity4 their slimming secret ? @entity23 and @entity24 are said to have tried the controversial diet an international weight loss phenomenon , he is credited with helping squeeze the @entity28 into her wedding dress and with working similar slimming marvels on @entity28 ’s mother , @entity32 , and sister , @entity33			1
other celebrities who have followed his regime - usually to shed pounds after having a baby - include @entity23 , @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity40 opera singer @entity39			1
and it was n’t just faddy showbusiness stars who became converts			0
after interviewing @entity4 on @entity45 , @entity44 started down his calorie - busting path			0
even president @entity47 reportedly adopted the @entity49 diet so he could have more luck reining in his expanding waistline than he has had with runaway @entity18 spending			1
and where stick - thin celebrities lead , the public is sure to follow			0
@entity4 ’s diet book , published in @entity18 in 2000 and the @entity57 in 2010 , has sold more than 11 million copies worldwide , been translated into 14 languages and published in 32 countries			1
in the family : as well as @entity33 , @entity28 and @entity32 were said to follow the @entity62 before the royal wedding an international phenomenon , he launched an online diet ‘ coaching ’ business as well as online shops			1
there are enough @entity72 books for a library , including the @entity74 , the @entity75 and @entity4 : the @entity76			0
last year , his company registered a turnover of £ 33 million			0
the charming , dapper @entity18 knows who to thank			1
when asked to explain his success in @entity57 , he said simply : ‘ it works , and @entity83			1
’ in late 2010 , mrs @entity24 went on record about his diet to say she had been ‘ doing it for four days and i ’ve lost 4lb ’			1
for many , the @entity62 did produce extraordinary , even life - changing , results			1
but there were always rumblings of dissent about his quick - fix diet formula of rapid weight loss tied to a strict regimen of 72 protein rich foods and a blanket ‘ non ’ to fats and carbohydrates			1
had n’t this been tried before with the @entity104 diet , some asked			2
but who cared so long as he was winning the war on our waistlines ? the @entity32 effect : dr @entity4 said mrs @entity24 's endorsement was a huge factor in his success in @entity57 now , though , the @entity49 phenomenon is falling to pieces before our eyes			2
the 72 - year - old nutritionist has been censured in the strongest terms by @entity18 ’s national medical board for ‘ breaching ethical regulations ’ in prescribing the drug mediator , an amphetamine derivative believed to have killed up to 1,800 people in @entity18 , to a patient who wanted to lose weight			1
‘ in resorting to untruthful assertions , dr @entity4 displayed behaviour which lacks probity and discredits the profession , ’ reads the medical board ’s ruling			1
he was given an eight - day ban from practising medicine and ordered to pay £ 5,160 in legal costs to the complainant			0
he denies wrongdoing and has said he will appeal			0
the penalties are purely symbolic as @entity4 voluntarily struck himself off the doctors ’ register last year after complaints			0
but it is a huge blow to the image and reputation of a man who has long traded on being a respected medical practitioner rather than a quack			2
the contents of the ruling are certainly damning			0
it says he prescribed a hugely controversial drug outside its main recommended use in treating overweight diabetics , and performed insufficient tests or follow - up checks			0
he also lied about the time frame of the prescription and about the patient ’s medical history			2
mediator - which was never approved in the @entity57 or @entity161 - was used for years in @entity18 on women who wanted to lose weight quickly			1
but it was withdrawn there in 2009 after the @entity18 health ministry blamed it for killing at least 500 people from heart - valve damage			1
@entity4 ’s patient - identified simply as ‘ @entity168 ’ in the @entity18 media - went to him to lose weight in 1971			1
years later , she discovered she suffered heart - valve damage which experts traced to mediator			2
will this spell the end for @entity4 ’s diet empire ? it is certainly true that he has never been branded a liar before			2
but the depressing truth is that the medical establishment has been attacking his dubious miracle claims for years , and yet people continue to flock to his banner			2
unsustainable : @entity185 columnist @entity44 regained the weight she lost on one level , it is easy to see the attraction			1
the four - step diet is helpfully simple and prescriptive , unfolding with all the determined precision of a military assault			1
step one is called the ‘ attack ’ phase - two to seven days of eating as much as you want of 72 almost pure protein foods such as fish , lean meat , skimmed milk and fat - free cottage cheese			2
step two - ‘ @entity201 ’ - involves continuing to eat the high - protein foods together with 28 types of carb - free vegetables such as brussels sprouts and spinach			2
@entity4 calls @entity212 ‘ consolidation ’ , adding fruit , bread , cheese and starchy foods			0
step four is ‘ stabilisation ’ , where you supposedly eat what you like without regaining weight , apart from on thursdays when you must stick to meat and eggs			1
for the rest of your life			0
medical critics have long argued it is dangerous , as are all heavily unbalanced diets			2
in 2011 , it was voted the year ’s worst diet by the @entity227 - worse even than those that advocate binge drinking or eating according to blood group			2
‘ there is absolutely no solid science behind this at all , ’ an association spokesman said			0
‘ this works on restricting foods , calories and portion control			0
cutting out food groups is not advisable			0
’ others have put it rather more forcefully			0
in the same year , @entity4 lost a slander case against @entity243 , a nutritionist who told a @entity18 magazine the @entity4 diet could cause ‘ serious health problems ’ such as a steep rise in cholesterol , cardiovascular problems and breast cancer			1
the hearing did not judge the case on scientific or health grounds but solely in relation to the slander claims			0
last year , it emerged that @entity257 , a 50 - year - old @entity57 advertising company boss , was left in a coma after trying the @entity72 diet			0
he recovered , but experts later confirmed he had suffered ammonia poisoning because of a genetic disorder that left him unable to get rid of the large amount of nitrogen - a by - product of protein breakdown - building up in his body			0
bestseller : but the @entity49 method has been criticised @entity4 was lambasted last year when he suggested @entity18 tackled its obesity problem ( yes , even @entity18 has one , though @entity72 trades heavily off his country ’s reputation for slender women ) by giving extra marks to secondary school students who lost weight or stayed thin			1
critics accused him of trying to create a nation of anorexics			0
a different criticism that should surely register with his followers is that - in the long term - many believe it simply does n’t work			0
@entity44 told in the @entity185 how she had lost 5st on the @entity62 , only to put it all back on again just as quickly			1
a survey of 5,000 @entity18 ‘ @entity283 ’ , as followers are known , found 35 per cent regained the weight within a year , and 80 per cent had put it back on within four years			1
@entity49 ’s cunning solution has been simply to adapt his diet with new books , such as this year ’s @entity290			0
@entity4 says he developed the diet in the @entity292 as a humble gp when a patient asked him how he could lose weight without giving up meat			2
he has always insisted his methods are safe and healthy , claiming that he would never endorse his diet for anyone ‘ who is healthy and at their right weight ’			2
but how many women in the world think they are at their ‘ right weight ’ ? it seems like a recipe for disaster for anyone to start a radically different eating regime merely because a self - appointed expert says you should			0
but , as @entity4 and his ilk know only too well , dieting ‘ experts ’ are preaching to a congregation of the desperate .			0

@entity83 , @entity39 and @entity23 have tried the @entity62
more than *11million* copies of his book have sold worldwide
but diet guru has been *slammed* by @entity18 's national medical board for ' breaching ethical regulations '
experts have criticised his four step diet plan as nutritionally unbalanced
some dieters have gone on to regain the weight they lost
