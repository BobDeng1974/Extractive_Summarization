she has been portrayed as a ‘ royal benefits scrounger ’ , a holidaying princess who lives a life of idle luxury at the taxpayer ’s expense			1
but last night princess @entity7 took the unusual step of responding to the criticism , telling friends that she is about to accept one of several job offers following the end of her post at @entity15			1
prince @entity17 ’s eldest daughter is said to have been very upset to find herself accused of being workshy after quitting her £ 20,000 - a - year job before taking three holidays in as many weeks			1
in fact , it seems that the @entity7 was an unexpected victim of the attacks on @entity15 ’s security system , presumed to have been made by @entity24 , in december			1
‘ @entity7 ’s job was semi closed down by @entity24 when her social security details were splashed all over the pages of @entity36 newspapers , ’ he said			1
as a result of the hacking , she resigned			2
@entity7 , 26 , has since been approached by headhunters , resulting in two job offers , one with a reputable technology company , and a further two interviews			1
@entity15 is also said to be attempting to persuade her to stay with them by offering to promote her above her current position			1
the friend said : ‘ @entity7 has got another two interviews next week and she is not scared of hard work			1
she ’s in her mid- 20s and is trying to build up work experience with financial companies and start - ups			1
‘ she has done plenty of work experience , so she can forge a serious career with lots of skills			2
’ last night , a friend of the family spoke out , telling @entity57 : ‘ this is like going back to the @entity59 when some people attacked the @entity61 , and we are not going to tolerate it			2
’ a close friend of the @entity65 added : ‘ @entity66 is incredibly protective of her daughters and may well make a robust statement defending them			2
‘ she will not accept unfair treatment of her girls			2
one of the reasons @entity73 went to @entity74 to work was to escape the intense spotlight in the @entity78 media			2
‘ on top of her day job , @entity7 can also say she works for her grandmother , the @entity81 , and has on occasion attended charity events at @entity84 in her lunch hour			1
’ @entity7 on holiday with pals in @entity88 a friend of @entity7 said : ‘ how dare people attack her for not working hard when she does exactly that in her office for charities and for the @entity95 ? ’ @entity7 , 26 , is said to be very passionate about the six charities of which she is a patron , including the @entity97 and @entity98 , a charity founded by her close friends @entity101 and @entity102			1
the princess carried out ten royal engagements last year while also working for @entity15 , and in november @entity7 and her mother attended a charity fundraiser at @entity107 , held in aid of the @entity109			1
@entity7 is patron of the charity and helped to raise £ 150,000 that night			1
as the sixth in line to the throne , @entity7 is constantly monitored by security guards , paid for by her father			1
she receives no public funds for her accommodation or lifestyle			2
last month , she and boyfriend @entity118 , 32 , took a trip to the @entity121 ski resort of @entity122 , where her parents own a £ 13 million chalet , and visited the @entity126 island of @entity88 twice			1
but the new claims suggest she took the trips in the expectation that february would bring a more important job with a healthier wage			1
@entity84 has insisted that the @entity7 ’s travel is always ‘ entirely privately funded ’ often with help from her parents and sometimes mr @entity118 , who earns a six - figure salary at @entity136			1
@entity137 , wrote the new prince @entity139 book @entity139 crushes biographer 's claim : @entity84 says writer had no special access to the prince by @entity145 , @entity146 the office of prince @entity139 has distanced itself from claims that a controversial new book was written with its co-operation			2
@entity36 @entity137 says she met the @entity139 and spoke to his closest aides while researching @entity139 : the heart of a @entity153			2
a journalist with @entity156 , ms @entity137 paints a picture of @entity158 torn apart by turf wars and describes the future @entity153 grappling with insecurities and struggling to control his courtiers and their infighting			2
but @entity163 , prince @entity139 ’s head of communications , said yesterday that the publishers had overplayed suggestions of official co-operation			0
she told @entity57 : ‘ it is not an official book			0
the author did not have the access as claimed			0
@entity158 has no further comment			0
’ royal sources said ms @entity137 did attend a dinner with the @entity139 , but was one of 75 guests and had no access to the top table			1
like other journalists , she joined the royal rota to cover prince @entity139 at work			1
to suggest there was intimate access is overblown			0
ms @entity137 ’s biography is one of three forthcoming books claiming to offer new detail about @entity139 , including one by @entity36 @entity188 , who has written biographies on the @entity81 and princess @entity190			1
one source said there seemed to be a ‘ race ’ between the two women to publish first			0
‘ perhaps that is why @entity137 is claiming to have had more access than she did			0
both books are unofficial , ’ he said			0
@entity199 ’s former spin - doctor @entity198 is also bringing out a book which claims to have new information about @entity139			2
publishers say ms @entity137 ’s book reveals ‘ a man in sight of happiness yet still driven by anguish ’ with ‘ views that mean he will never be as impartial as his mother ’			0
ms @entity137 ’s book – extracts of which were published on kindle and in the @entity214 yesterday – suggests @entity158 is riddled with ‘ glaring systemic weaknesses ’			0
she also writes that any criticism of the prince , who is known to courtiers as ‘ the boss ’ , can send him spiralling into ‘ despair ’ , while turf battles between @entity139 ’s staff ‘ are common and bloody ’			0
‘ one former householder refers to @entity158 as @entity224 , ’ she says			0
according to ms @entity137 , much difficulty is caused by @entity139 ’s inability to create clear roles for his staff			0
he is accused of causing turf wars by failing to set courtiers clear boundaries			0
but close sources dismiss these claims			0
‘ anyone who visits @entity158 always say what a happy ship it is			0
the staff do n’t recognise @entity240 ’s claims			0
‘ it is convenient , is n’t it , that the television adaptation of @entity224 is doing well now as the book comes out			0
’ distance : @entity139 with pr chief @entity163 , who says new book by @entity137 , left , is not official despite his current pr headaches , @entity139 is continuing to trust press team leader @entity163 with nurturing his public image			0
@entity163 , 48 , has recently signed a new contract and a source said : ‘ the prince is delighted			0
she is the bedrock of his communications team			0
