published : 03:19 est , 18 april 2014 updated : 10:44 est , 18 april 2014 like many other young girls , @entity0 , 17 , dreams of becoming a ballerina and of taking to the stage at the @entity4 one day			1
but achieving her dream wo n't be easy for @entity0 lives in the @entity7 capital , @entity8 ; a place where , since the start of the year , more than 2,000 people have been killed in car bomb attacks and religious extremists consider dancing sinful			1
despite the risks , she continues to attend the @entity15 , the only place in @entity7 that teaches classical music and dance			1
' it 's totally different from out there			2
outside you hear car bombs and gunfire			2
inside the school , everything is beautiful			0
' but her dreams of a career in dance means overcoming fierce opposition from religious extremists who believe both ballet and music to be against the teachings of @entity45			1
as a result , the school is forced to employ four heavily armed security guards for fear of being attacked			0
' @entity50 is prohibited and considered infidel , ' explains @entity52 , one of the last two ballet teachers in @entity7			1
dangerous : like others in @entity8 , @entity0 faces sectarian violence each day - 200 are killed every week terrifying : the aftermath of a bomb attack in @entity8			1
most are planted by @entity59 or @entity60 militiamen ' we have no support or protection and therefore , we avoid performing			0
i ca n't arrange a ballet performance			1
i ca n't say i 'm a ballet teacher			1
it 's very difficult to leave work knowing that it might be blown up			0
' equally deadly are the daily car bombings , most the result of intensifying violence between @entity59 and @entity60			1
so bad has the violence become , parts of the city have become no - go areas , while huge walls , ostensibly for protection , separate the @entity59 minority from the rest of the city			1
and the students at the @entity81 are n't immune			0
on 13th january 2014 , one of @entity0 's friends , a boy named @entity84 , was killed by a bomb			1
@entity84 , a @entity60 , would join @entity0 , a @entity59 , after school each day as she waited for her father to arrive and pick her up			1
tragedy : @entity0 's friend @entity84 died when a bomb went off on his bus			1
he had to be identified by his clothes but one day , that changed			0
' he asked me , " should i wait with you until your lift comes ? " , ' remembers @entity0			1
' i said , " go now before it gets dark "			0
minutes later , @entity0 had a call from her mother			1
' my mum called and said , " @entity84 has been injured "			0
i called @entity84 's phone and a stranger answered			0
he said , " call this boy 's family and tell them he 's been killed "			2
the bus @entity84 was in had been attacked by a suicide bomber			0
his body was so badly damaged , he had to be identified using his id , mobile phone and clothes			0
' i pray for the girls every day , ' confesses @entity0 's @entity115 mother			1
' once they 'd catch the bus but now it 's not safe			0
the road , the car , even the school is not safe			0
still , i believe @entity122 will keep themselves			0
' despite the dangers , @entity0 refuses to give up her studies at ballet school - despite the presence of a conventional school much closer to home			1
' there is a school closer to home , yes , ' she admits			0
' i prefer to go through the dangers for my reasons , for my ballet			2
' brave : @entity0 says she plans to continue her ballet training and hopes , if nothing else , to become a teacher angry : teacher @entity52 says she is terrified leaving school in case she returns to find it has been bombed but with just 10 months to go before she is due to graduate from the school , she is faced with some tough decisions			1
should she follow the example of 40 per cent of @entity7 's musicians and dancers and leave the country ? or attempt to dance for a living at home ? ' of course i will always dream of becoming famous around all the @entity153 countries , @entity154 , @entity155			1
if i stay in @entity8 , i will not gain any experience			1
i will not learn anything new			0
i will only grow within my own expertise			0
'' if i stay , i hope i could become a ballet teacher , ' she says			2
' clearly i could train others and perform ballet at cultural events			2
after that , we 'll see what happens			0
' teacher @entity52 is unconvinced			0
' graduating is it for her in ballet unless she travels abroad , ' she says			2
' if she found somebody to sponsor her at the school , she could continue as a ballet teacher			2
even that 's a small possibility			0
' high hopes : despite the challenges , @entity0 hopes to one day take to the stage at the @entity4 angrily , she adds : ' killing , claiming that this is prohibited , that all your work is prohibited ... before it was the opposite , it was different			1
art was respected , especially ballet			2
' whether @entity0 chooses to go abroad or not , one thing is certain : she will continue to dance whatever happens in @entity7			1
' i want to dance , ' she says			0
' this is a natural act			0
there must be room for art and dancing			0
maybe then , their [ the extremists ] mindset will change			2
' if i have to quit ballet , i will change my nationality , even if it makes me very depressed			2
i will not stop dancing until i 'm old			0
' @entity0 appears on @entity194 , tonight at 7.30pm on channel			1
