' a woman 's place is in the house : @entity18 , now part of the @entity67 leadership team , gave the response address last year awkward : @entity95 sen. @entity94 became an @entity138 sensation when he paused for a drink in the middle of his speech @entity88 gov. @entity87 ( left ) responded to @entity4 in 2009 and gave a wooden performance that was widely mocked ; in 2010 it was then - @entity144 gov. @entity89 's turn ( right ) – but he 'll soon be giving all his speeches from behind bars @entity147 boasted that @entity0 ' is a mother , a soldier , and an independent leader who serves in @entity58 because @entity97 voted for change in the last election			1
