if there 's one thing to send a shiver down the spine of a celebrity it 's the unveiling of a before - they - were - famous video			1
the saying goes that everyone has to start somewhere , yet many a-listers would prefer to forget those few early steps on the way to stardom			0
and in this compilation video , we are treated to soap and showering , cheesy grins outside fast - food restaurants , and @entity15 enjoying his @entity21 ( cigarette )			1
it is a far cry from the tough guy he portrayed in @entity34 , that 's for certain			2
the montage of stars of the screen also includes @entity38 , star of @entity40 's hit drama @entity41			1
in that show , @entity38 plays a less - than - clean - living @entity43 , who becomes mr @entity44 in the world of drug production and dealing			1
yet in this clip from around 1987 , @entity38 is clean as a whistle after advertising shield soap , which we are told ' leaves you clean and fresh all day long			2
' the advert ends with a female telling a cleaned - down @entity38 he is a ' changed man ' - very different from his latest tv portrayal in @entity41			1
not to be outdone , @entity38 's @entity41 co-star @entity57 's drug in his 1999 commercial is the cereal pops			1
in a haze , @entity57 tells us that ' all he wants to do is eat ' , before his screen father caves in and hands over the box to			2
fresh : @entity38 , star of @entity41 , was a ' new man ' after he showered using @entity68 soap fast food : @entity71 's first date went well as he treated his on - screen flame to a @entity73 for dinner it 's always a struggle to get children to eat their greens , yet @entity78 showed how it 's done when he starred in an 1990 advert for cheddar cheese			1
a plate consisting of greens is transformed , perhaps a bit too dramatically , by a deluge of melted cheddar cheese , with @entity87 by saying ' hooray '			0
@entity89 got his crunch back in 1987 when he advertised @entity92 's cornflakes			2
the 49 - year - old star of the trilogy of films @entity96 sits at a desk tucking into corn flakes , before recoiling back in ecstasy			2
in one of the more humorous clips , actor @entity100 tells us all about ' this dream he had ' where he changed into the ' guy from the fruit loops box , @entity107 in a clip from the early 1990s			0
but the jokes on him , as it is actually his co-star on the advert , and also an actor today @entity113 who is ' the toucan ' as he rips off his fake human face to reveal a beak			0
perhaps not surprising , the fast - food industry was keen to use child actors to publicise their offerings			1
suck it up : @entity15 chills back as he enjoys a ' @entity122 ' cigarette @entity123 is pictured outside a @entity124 expressing her love for the fast food chain back in 1981 , and we also see @entity128 saying that ' you 've got ta break the rules ' as he too gives in to the @entity124 charm in an ad from 1989			1
@entity133 tells us all about the ' are n't you hungry for a whopper game ' also in publicity for the chain from 1982			0
rivals @entity73 get in on the act with @entity71 perched on doorstep with a girl back in 1980 , who ' thanks ' him for dinner after giving him a peck on the cheek , as ' nobody makes a day like @entity73 can			0
' @entity145 shows off a gleaming smile in her 1993 performaance for @entity148 's bbq sauce , but the best is saved until last			0
at a time when it was perceived as ' cool ' to smoke , legendary actor @entity15 tells us all how ' smooth ' the @entity153 cigarettes are from his 1971 advertisement			0
the clip is ended with the immortal line uttered by @entity157 strong , stay @entity153			0
if that could n't have tempted you at the time , then nothing would !			0

@entity24 starred in happy - go - lucky @entity27 ad in the 1980s
