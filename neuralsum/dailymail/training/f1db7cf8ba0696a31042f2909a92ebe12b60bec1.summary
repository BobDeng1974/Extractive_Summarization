by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 has landed his second signing of the summer after @entity4 confirmed that midfielder @entity5 is heading for @entity6			1
@entity7 revealed how @entity8 had activated a £ 9.75million ( 12m euro ) escape clause in @entity11 's @entity4 contract by faxing a bid to the @entity14 club in the past 24 hours			1
leverkusen have now admitted @entity8 have made their move and that everything has been agreed for the transfer to go through			1
close : @entity8 are set to sign @entity4 midfielder @entity5 after activating his release clause signal of intent : manager @entity2 has been busy trying to sort incomings out early on for next year sealed : @entity24 has already secured a £ 4m move from @entity26 this close season ' up until yesterday , i would have said it was just rumours about @entity5 , ' @entity4 's chief executive @entity28 told @entity32 paper @entity31			1
' but now i can confirm that we have received an official offer from @entity8 , and i expect a very quick conclusion to it			1
' @entity2 has been chasing the @entity37 under 21 international for a while and has been over to personally check on the player 's progress			1
the 20 - year - old is an energetic box - to - box midfielder and should provide the @entity43 with extra impetus in the middle of the park			1
@entity47 were also keen on @entity11 but it was always his intention to move to the @entity50			0
the club hope to have a deal concluded within the week as they press ahead with plans for an assault on the @entity50 title			0
the player 's agent , @entity57 , is a familiar face around @entity6 after brokering a loan move with the club for @entity62 in 2012			1
@entity2 is keen to get his transfer business done early			1
@entity24 has already signed for £ 4million from @entity26 ahead of the @entity64 and they continue to pursue @entity66 midfielder @entity65			2
they came within a slip of winning the league last month and the belief is that if they can keep hold of @entity74 - who was linked with a move to @entity76 in the @entity78 press on wednesday morning - and supplement that with shrewd additions , they 'll be in a better position to challenge come august			2
can is one of the most versatile young players in the @entity14			1
having spent most of his career so far in the youth set up at @entity85 , the @entity87 - born player was one pipped for the top from an extremely early age			2
after only four first - team appearances at @entity85 , though , @entity11 's star faded during the 2012/13 season , and so in the summer of 2013 he chose to make the switch to @entity4			2
it has done him a world of good , and he has developed into an invaluable midfield force for his new club			0
he has also represented @entity37 at every level from under 15 to under 21			1
can prefers to play in central midfield - ' either attacking or defending , i do n't care either way ' - but has been employed as a centre - back and a left - back on various occasions			2
as captain of the @entity32 under 17s team , he was the calming influence at the heart of play			0
his physical strength is of particular use going forward , though he is rarely overly reckless			0
it has been remarked on several occasions that can seems to have a maturity beyond his years , and his technical ability as a playmaker , either from the back or the front , is now beyond doubt			0
the most commonly drawn comparison is @entity122			0
and not only because the young @entity5 puts as much effort into his hairstye as @entity122 once did			0
his ability to switch effortlessly from defence to midfield , his dangerous shot , and his control over the pace of the game all do remind one of the established @entity85 star			0
for those watching his marauding runs through the centre at @entity4 this season though , @entity134 has always also sprung to mind			0
it is little surprise that these two @entity85 stars have had an influence on can 's play			0
he has trained with them , or at least in close proximity to them , for several of his formative years			0

@entity8 faxed bid for @entity37 under 21 international can
@entity2 has shown lots of faith in young players at @entity6
the 20 - year - old is an energetic box - to - box midfielder
