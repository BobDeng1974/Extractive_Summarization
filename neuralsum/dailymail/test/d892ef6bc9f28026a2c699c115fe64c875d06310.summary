@entity1 ace @entity0 scored twice as @entity1 cruised past @entity3 giants @entity2 at the @entity4			1
the @entity5 was on hand to embarrass fellow countryman @entity7 as the former @entity9 defender endured a horrendous evening in @entity10			1
@entity11 sorted the best from the rest during the @entity15 clash at the @entity4 ... @entity1 @entity16 6.5 : called into action for the first time by @entity19 in the second half and dealt with the @entity22 ’s powerful drive well , before fielding an @entity24 strike too			1
one of the quietest evenings he will have			2
@entity27 7.5 : wound back the years to give everyone a reminder of why he was considered the best right - back in the world			1
dazzling stepovers then a wicked cross for @entity0 to bury			1
@entity7 takes on @entity2 ace @entity33 during their match at the @entity4 @entity36 5 : had little to do but shanked a couple of clearances horribly , which is out of character for the defender			1
was also robbed by @entity19 , though it came to nothing			2
suffering a minor dip after a few months in which he has been at his very best			2
@entity46 6 : @entity47 was the player assigned to deal with @entity19 and @entity46 was left with little else to do , in a quiet evening for @entity1 ’s defence			1
@entity46 reacts during @entity1 's @entity15 clash with @entity2 at the @entity4 @entity51 6 : did n’t bother rampaging forward like you often catch him doing in @entity54			1
in theory that was to take care of @entity57 , but the striker was extremely quiet			2
@entity59 7 : helped to snuff out the threat of @entity19 when the forward dropped into his midfield zone			0
started a few @entity1 attacks with his usual eye for a quick pass			1
@entity67 7.5 : contributed to @entity1 ’s high pressing , caging @entity2 in their own final third			1
physically fit enough to get back and help out in his own defensive quarters too			0
in games like these @entity1 midfielder @entity67 holds off opposition midfielder @entity33 as the @entity74 side breezed through @entity75 9 : has not quite found his best rhythm under @entity77 but his amazing dribble to set up @entity0 ’s goal was pure @entity75			1
substituted at half - time for @entity81			0
@entity82 6.5 : stayed wide on the right for a long while , conserving energy			0
given his efforts against @entity88 at the weekend , and in general during an extremely busy month , he can be forgiven			0
when he contributed to the game , it was with his usual quality , and whipped a strike inches wide of the left post in stoppage time			0
@entity95 wizard @entity82 dances his way through the @entity1 defence as they cruise through @entity98 6.5 : extremely unselfish			1
the @entity100 did a lot of running and although it did n’t come to fruition on a personal level , he earned @entity0 acres of space and @entity1 were rewarded			1
huge applause when he was substituted			0
@entity0 9 : two clinical finishes here , and plenty of direct , dangerous running which makes him impossible to handle			1
final ball when trying to set up his team - mates sometimes needs a bit more precision , but that will come			0
@entity5 @entity0 grabbed himself two goals as the @entity54 giants eased through to the next round @entity120 @entity81 6.5 : the @entity4 relishes every chance it gets to see this old legend , before he heads off into the sun at the end of the season			1
( by sun , read @entity127 , although a deal has not been finalised )			0
@entity129 6 : a rare opportunity which was mainly useful for giving @entity59 ’ legs a rest			0
@entity133 6 : this could be one of his last appearances at the @entity4 , but did n’t have time to show off			1
@entity2 @entity138 6 : could do nothing about the goals , but at least he had the perfect view of @entity1 ’s calculated , technically excellent display			1
@entity143 3.5 : lost @entity0 for the second goal – the @entity5 was his man – and was made to look a fool by him and @entity75 on more than one occasion			1
@entity143 does his best to hold off the tackle of @entity1 's @entity51 at the @entity4 @entity149 4.5 : his centre - back partner was in the spotlight for the goals , but he was n’t even on the scene which was a crime in itself			1
far from commanding – @entity2 would have looked a lot stronger had @entity155 been fit			0
@entity7 5 : it took less than three minutes for the @entity5 to end up in the book , after fouling @entity67			1
ten minutes later he was beaten for pace by @entity0 , who broke the deadlock and killed the tie			1
stepped up a gear in the second half – at least he cared			0
@entity7 puts his head in where it hurts as @entity2 take on @entity1 at the @entity4 on tuesday @entity166 6 : excellent defending prevented @entity82 from adding a third at the end			1
given how little of the ball @entity2 had , it was n’t an evening for showing off his attacking talents			0
@entity174 6 : fired wide when well placed on the edge of the box in the second half			0
brought a bit of spice to proceedings , but it was far from sufficient for @entity182 ’s side			0
@entity183 6 : @entity184 and @entity7 aside , looked like the only @entity2 player who really , truly cared			2
put out a few fires , including a good tackle to halt a @entity82 surge , but that did n’t help while the rest of the side were falling apart			0
@entity183 has all eyes on the ball as he comes up against @entity1 's @entity194 during their clash @entity196 4 : the former @entity199 midfielder ’s presence on the pitch was barely noted			2
the game passed him by , so did @entity75			0
taken off after 66 minutes and deservedly so			0
@entity33 3 : gave the ball away countless times in the first half			0
looked on a different , albeit not necessarily better , wavelength than the other @entity2 players			0
ruined one break in the second half with an awful through - ball , which flew straight to @entity16			0
@entity33 takes aim at @entity1 's goal as the @entity3 giants do their best to get back into the game @entity57 4 : another sad night for the forward			1
even before he was taken off , @entity1 ’s half - time substitute @entity81 had already had more touches of the ball than he had enjoyed in the entire game			2
totally out of the action			0
@entity19 4.5 : the most danger he caused @entity1 ’s defence was a stay arm that caught @entity46 square on the head			2
had a point to prove to the jeering @entity1 fans but never looked like doing it			2
former @entity1 striker @entity19 attempts to take the ball round @entity95 @entity46 @entity120 @entity230 6.5 : fired over the bar when well placed as the game neared its conclusion			2
but for an injury , would have started and could have caused @entity27 some problems with more time			2
@entity24 6.5 : added a bit of pace , in place of @entity57 , which the team was missing up front			0
@entity242 6 : maintained the status quo .			0

@entity0 scored twice as @entity1 eased through at the @entity4
