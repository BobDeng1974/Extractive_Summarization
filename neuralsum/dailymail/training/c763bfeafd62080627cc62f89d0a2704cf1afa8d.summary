@entity1 officials knew almost immediately that the attack on the @entity4 facility in @entity5 , @entity6 , on 9 - 11 - 2012 was a terrorist attack and not a demonstration gone wrong , declassified documents have shown			1
the documents - which were obtained by @entity11 and contain 450 pages of top secret testimonies about the attack - has proven the @entity16 administration lied about the cause of the attack for two weeks afterward , having repeatedly maintained it was sparked by a violent demonstration against an @entity21 movie			1
according to the documents , gen. @entity22 - who at the time was head of @entity24 , the @entity1 combatant command with jurisdiction over @entity6 - said that while there was mention of the demonstrations - which started on the same day day as @entity5 but in @entity32 - he and the other commanders involved were always clear that @entity5 was a terrorist attack			1
attack : @entity35 questioned @entity16 over the handling of the @entity5 raid , above , that took place in 2012 newly declassified documents prove president @entity16 and then - secretary of state @entity40 knew the @entity5 attack was an act of terrorism almost immediately despite continuing to say it was a demonstration gone awry the documents featuring a testimony with @entity4 general @entity22 ( pictured ) - who who at the time was head of @entity24 - received a call about the @entity5 attack 15 minutes after it happened and that it ' was always clear ' it was a terrorist attack that information was delivered to president @entity16 and his top advisers , including then - defense secretary @entity54			1
however the government said the attack was caused out of protest of @entity58 , a controversial 14 - minute video uploaded to @entity59 that was seen as denigrating of the prophet @entity61			2
the movie subsequently caused a breakout of violence in @entity32 on september 11 that spread to other @entity67 and @entity68 nations and caused the death of 50 people			2
that night , a heavily armed group of between 125 and 150 gunmen attacked the @entity4 diplomatic mission at @entity5 , killing @entity4 ambassador @entity74 and another diplomat			2
then secretary of state @entity40 supported the @entity16 administration claims that @entity68 was believed to be cause , and chose the @entity78 to conduct an ' investigation ' into the attack			1
the investigation determined that there was no such protest in @entity83 and that the attack was premeditated and launched by @entity86 militants			0
skepticism has surrounded the government 's explanation of the attack , especially from the @entity91 , mostly because @entity5 happened just two months before the @entity92			2
at about 9.30pm on september 11 , 2012 , a heavily armed group of between 125 and 150 gunmen attacked the @entity4 diplomatic mission at @entity5 ( pictured ) killing @entity4 ambassador @entity74 and another diplomat however the declassification of the documents proves the @entity16 administration were not divulging details of the attack to the @entity4 people			1
numerous aides to the president and @entity102 repeatedly told the public in the weeks following the murder of @entity74 and three other @entity4 that night - as @entity16 's hotly contested bid for re-election was entering its final stretch - that there was no evidence the killings were the result of a premeditated terrorist attack			1
according to @entity11 , gen. @entity22 said he learned about the assault on the consulate compound within 15 minutes of its commencement , at 9:42 pm @entity6 time , through a call he received from the @entity118			1
' my first call was to @entity121 , @entity121 's office , to say , '' hey , i am headed down the hall			0
i need to see him right away '' , ' @entity22 told lawmakers on the @entity125 on june 26 of last year			0
' i told him what i knew			0
we immediately walked upstairs to meet with @entity128			0
' @entity130 's account of that fateful day was included in some 450 pages of testimony given by senior @entity1 officials in classified , closed - door hearings conducted last year by the @entity136 subcommittee			1
the testimony , given under ' @entity139 ' clearance and only declassified this month , presents a rare glimpse into how information during a crisis travels at the top echelons of @entity4 's national security apparatus , all the way up to the president			2
new documents obtained by @entity11 prove the @entity16 administration did n't divulge what they knew about the @entity5 consulate attack to the @entity4 people also among those whose secret testimony was declassified was @entity121 , the first person @entity130 briefed about @entity5			1
@entity22 told lawmakers he considered it a fortuitous ' happenstance ' that he was able to rope @entity121 and @entity54 into one meeting , so that , as @entity130 put it , ' they had the basic information as they headed across for the meeting at the @entity161 '			0
@entity22 also told lawmakers he met with @entity54 and @entity121 when they returned from their 30 - minute session with president @entity16 on september 11			1
armed services chairman @entity165 ' @entity164 , @entity166 , sitting in on the subcommittee 's hearing with @entity130 last june , reserved for himself an especially sensitive line of questioning : namely , whether senior @entity16 administration officials , in the very earliest stages of their knowledge of @entity5 , had any reason to believe that the assault grew spontaneously out of a demonstration over an anti-islam video produced in @entity4			1
' in your discussions with @entity121 and @entity128 , ' @entity164 asked , ' was there any mention of a demonstration or was all discussion about an attack ? ' @entity22 initially testified that there was some ' peripheral ' discussion of this subject , but added ' at that initial meeting , we knew that a @entity4 facility had been attacked and was under attack , and we knew at that point that we had two individuals , ambassador @entity74 and mr. [ @entity197 ] @entity196 , unaccounted for '			2
aftermath : the @entity4 government said for two weeks that the attack of the @entity4 consulate in @entity5 was a protest turned violent , however new documents show that ' within minutes ' of the incident they knew it was the work of terrorists rep. @entity207 , @entity208 , a first - term lawmaker with experience as an @entity211 war veteran and army reserve officer , pressed @entity22 further on the point , prodding the 29 - year @entity215 veteran to admit that ' the nature of the conversation ' he had with @entity54 and @entity121 was that ' this was a terrorist attack '			1
' as a military person , i am concerned that someone in the military would be advising that this was a demonstration			0
i would hope that our military leadership would be advising that this was a terrorist attack , ' @entity207 said			0
' again , sir , i think , you know , there was some preliminary discussion about , you know , maybe there was a demonstration			0
but i think at the command , i personally and i think the command very quickly got to the point that this was not a demonstration , this was a terrorist attack , ' @entity22 answered			0
' and you would have advised as such if asked			0
would that be correct ? @entity207 continued			0
' well , and with @entity121 and @entity128 , that is the nature of the conversation we had , yes , sir , ' @entity22 responded			0
@entity239 says they are going to continue to release more information found in the testimonies .			0

newly declassified testimonies about what happened among @entity1 officials the night of the @entity5 attack on september 11 , 2012 have been obtained by @entity11
the documents show the @entity4 military found out about 15 minutes after the attack - which killed four @entity4 - that it was an act of terror and *communicated* that to the @entity16 administration
however the government - including @entity16 and then - @entity4 secretary of state @entity40 , who were in the throes of the 2012 @entity259 - maintained for two weeks afterward the attack started as a protest against an @entity21 film and turned violent
