this year has been one of highs and lows for @entity3			1
the former first lady and senator became a grandmother for the first time after her daughter @entity9 gave birth , but she was also the cover of @entity13 's lowest - selling issue			1
according to a report from @entity17 on monday , the issue of people featuring @entity3 was worst selling of 2014 with 503,890 copies sold			1
@entity3 was on the cover for @entity13 's worst selling issue this year the june 16 cover , featuring @entity3 wearing a salmon pink tunic and a bright turquoise beaded necklace , attracted attention when it was published because of @entity3 's stance			1
conservative blogger @entity27 floated the idea that @entity3 was holding a walker in the picture			1
when contacted by @entity31 , @entity32 , a senior vice president of communications at @entity34 , which owns people , replied : ' @entity3 is standing next to a patio chair in the backyard of her home where the photo shoot took place ! ' i have also attached another photo from the shoot - thanks for checking in on this			1
' the magazine 's best - selling issue - 1,169,800 copies - was the one featuring @entity48 after his death in late august the magazine 's best - selling issue - 1,169,800 copies - was the one featuring @entity48 after his death in august			1
@entity3 's book @entity53 , which detailed her time as secretary of state under @entity57 , also did not sell as well as anticipated - @entity3 was reportedly paid a whopping $ 14 million advance			1
but it 's not all bad news - a poll has revealed @entity3 is the early frontrunner in the 2016 presidential election			1
although the former secretary of state has yet to announce her candidacy , 50 per cent of @entity64 voters have said they can see themselves supporting her if she runs			1
mrs @entity3 , 67 , has said she will make her decision on whether or not to run for the @entity68 2016 early next year			1
the poll found that half of voters support another @entity3 president , while 48 per cent oppose it			2
despite only a small margin of support , hers is significantly stronger than that of any rumoured @entity78 nominees			0
one reason for this could be that ms @entity3 , a former first lady and @entity83 senator is viewed as the likely @entity85 nominee if she runs with few other candidates seen as competition			2
this becomes clear when polling only @entity85 voters , where 82 per cent said they could see themselves supporting her if she runs , and only 15 per cent saying they can not			0
one likely @entity78 opponent @entity91 , who announced that he is ' actively exploring ' running for president 2016 , only has a 31 per cent support , the poll by @entity95 / @entity94 said			0
@entity78 nominee 2012 @entity97 fared marginally better with 33 per cent saying they could see themselves supporting him			0
frontrunner : half of @entity64 voters would support @entity3 for president if she decides to run for office in 2016 , a poll has found however , 57 percent say they could not support @entity91 , the younger brother of @entity105 , while a full 60 per cent said they would not be backing @entity97			2
mr @entity91 took one step further towards the @entity78 nominee contest yesterday when he announced on @entity109 that he will he will ' actively explore the possibility of running '			0
many , both rivals and experts , saw his statement as a de facto announcement that ends months of speculation about his intentions			0
the son and brother of presidents , 61 - year - old former @entity118 governor @entity91 is the early favorite of the @entity78 establishment wing			2
his move puts immediate pressure on other establishment - minded @entity78 contenders to start competing with him for donors , campaign staff and national attention in a crowded field of potential contenders			2
in a race likely to include fiery conservatives such as sen. @entity135 of @entity136 and former neurosurgeon @entity137 , @entity91 will occupy the middle ground despite his overwhelmingly conservative record as @entity118 's chief executive from 1999 to 2007			0
he also gives his party a powerful tool for courting the nation 's surging @entity144 population			0
@entity91 is married to a @entity146 , speaks @entity147 and has been among the @entity78 's most outspoken advocates for an immigration overhaul , including a pathway to citizenship for immigrants who are living in the country illegally			0
@entity155 sen. @entity154 again said yesterday that she 's not running for president , regardless of pleas from the progressive base for her to seek the @entity85 nomination in 2016			0
' you know , i 'm just here to stand up for hardworking families who just want a fighting chance			0
' that 's what i 'm in this fight for , and i 'm in this fight all the way , ' @entity166 told @entity172 yesterday morning			0
the left - wing politician was careful not to say that she was ' never ' running , however , leaving open the possibility of a future candidacy - potentially sooner than she 's letting on publicly .			2
