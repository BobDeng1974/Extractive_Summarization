a @entity1 girl with a rare medical problem has the appearance of a child - despite being 19 - years - old			1
@entity5 was born in june 1994 in the township of @entity7 in @entity8 in south - western @entity1 's @entity9			1
at seven years old , she stopped growing and was diagnosed with a tumour on her pituitary gland , which caused a deficiency in growth hormones			1
@entity5 , 19 ( left ) , has the appearance of a seven - year - old as she stopped growing at this age due to a rare tumour on her pituitary gland			1
this gland releases growth and puberty hormones instead of going to school , @entity5 was used as a child beggar due to her young appearance			1
after her father died in 2013 , leaving her alone , she was taken in by a couple who have taken her to the doctor			2
they hope to take her to a specialist soon to see if anything can be done about her condition the pituitary gland is found behind the bridge of the nose and below the base of the brain , and is about the size of a pea			1
it releases hormones growth and puberty hormones , among others , directly into the blood stream			1
tumours on the pituitary gland - though rare - can stop people growing and developing normally , said @entity46 , professor of endocrinology at @entity48			1
he told @entity49 : ' if you 've got a pituitary tumour , it can stop growth hormones being released			1
' you end up like a @entity54 person that looks small but is perfectly formed			0
' without treatment this woman wo n't grow at all , but she would age normally			2
' some say such children may even live longer than expected but that is uncertain			0
' but in @entity1 , treatment for pituitary problems is not routinely available unless you pay for it			2
' pituitary patients often do n't get the help they need			2
' this was the case for @entity5 's parents , who could n't afford to pay for treatment			1
they argued bitterly about the disease before finally divorcing , leaving @entity5 with her father @entity73 , 43			1
@entity46 , professor of endocrinology at @entity48 , said of @entity5 's condition : ‘ if you ’ve got a pituitary tumour , it can stop growth hormones being released			1
‘ you end up a tomb thumb person , that looks small but is perfectly formed			0
‘ without treatment this woman wo n’t grow at all			0
this woman would age normally , some say such children may even live longer than expected but that is uncertain			2
the pituitary gland is a pea - sized gland found found behind the bridge of the nose and below the base of the brain ‘ in @entity1 treatment for pituitary problems is not routinely available unless you pay for it			1
' pituitary patients often do n’t get the help they need			2
‘ this would n’t happen in the @entity100 , as paediatricians would be vigilant towards it			0
pituitary tumour in childhood are very uncommon			1
one in 1000 adults has one and they are less common in children , he said			0
some have a gene defect or a faulty gene			0
he added : ‘ now we have artificial growth hormones , that can be injected once a day , to treat this condition			1
‘ if you lose growth hormones you lose other hormones and you do n’t ever go through puberty so you can have side effects like losing hair			1
but shortly after the divorce , her father was also diagnosed as being seriously ill. unable to pay any of their bills , the pair ended up on the streets begging , travelling from their home to the cities of @entity130 , @entity131 and @entity132			2
instead of going to school , @entity5 was used as a child beggar due to her young appearance			1
in 2013 , @entity5 's father died from gastric cancer , leaving her alone			1
after she was spotted begging , a warm - hearted couple who had two grown - up daughters of their own , agreed to take her in			2
@entity142 , 50 , said that when they first saw her , he and his wife were unsure if she was a boy or girl because she had no hair , and had suffered horrific physical problems because of her medical condition			0
she is now getting regular medical care and although she is 20 , still looks as if she is seven or eight - years - old and has the mental ability of a child aged around five or six			1
mr @entity153 said : ' we plan to take her after the @entity155 to a doctor in the capital @entity158 who might be able to help her			0
' for the moment she is okay with us , but we want to try and get into a position where she might be able to do something for herself when we are no longer able to look after her			0
' @entity5 has made it clear she is hugely attached to her new parents			2
her biggest wish is to be able to go to school , even though no schools at the moment will take her because of her real age rather than her apparent age			2
commenting on the photographs and the story , professor @entity46 told @entity49 : ' this would n't happen in the @entity100 , as paediatricians would be vigilant towards it			0
' pituitary tumours in childhood are very uncommon			0
one in 1,000 adults has one and they are less common in children			0
' some have a gene defect or a faulty gene			0
' we used to treat people with this condition with pituitaries from cadavers and dead people , but that led to complications			0
' but luckily now we have artificial growth hormones , that can be injected once a day			1
' if you lose growth hormones you lose other hormones and you do n't ever go through puberty , so you can have side effects like losing hair			1
he added that any treatment administered now to help her grow may not be successful			0
he said : ' whether anything can be done for her now is unclear			0
it depends on her bone age			0
' i assume she did n't go through puberty so she did n't make sex hormones			2
' in that case her bones will have fused			0
' if the bones have an age of 8 or 9 , she could respond to treatment , if she has bones that have an age of 14 , she probably wo n't grow anymore			0
' it would certainly be worth trying			0
' she 'll have to be investigated for all the other hormones the pituitary gland makes too			2
' @entity5 was born in june 1994 ( her identity card is pictured ) but looks like a young child			1
' in @entity1 , treatment for pituitary problems is not routinely available unless you pay for it			0
pituitary patients often do n't get the help they need , ' said @entity46 , professor of endocrinology at the @entity48			0

@entity5 , 19 , stopped growing at the age of 7 due to a pituitary tumour
this meant she *lacked* growth hormones and never went through puberty
now she has the appearance of a 7 - year - old despite being a young adult
spent years working as a child beggar for her father due to her appearance
has now been adopted by a family who hope to take her to a specialist
