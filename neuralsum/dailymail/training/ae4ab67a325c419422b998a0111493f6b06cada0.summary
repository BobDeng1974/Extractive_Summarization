by @entity0 last updated at 7:22 pm on 25th february 2012 they say never mix politics and romance , but one @entity5 delegate must have missed the memo			1
@entity8 @entity7 addressed the @entity9 last week and described how he unsuccessfully tried to seduce his wife days before			1
his wife was n’t upset over unwashed dishes or a promise he did n’t keep – she refused him sex after seeing him support the controversial bill requiring women seeking an abortion to first get a trans - vaginal ultrasound			1
he had put the children to bed , and he had red wine			2
the night was ripe to have an intimate moment with his wife , @entity37			1
he said he had a ‘ giant ’ 48 - inch television that he turned on to the @entity41 game because ‘ my wife loves the @entity41 more than she loves me			1
’ he put on ‘ mood music ’ on the @entity9 floor and pantomimed putting his arm around his wife			2
but he said the romantic mood was killed while they were flipping through channels			2
mood killer ? @entity50 slammed @entity52 lawmakers in @entity5 for pushing the unnecessary medical procedure on women seeking abortions in the portion of the show @entity7 and his wife watched one less : @entity59 said there would be one less @entity8 in this world because of watching the show mr @entity7 landed on the @entity62 , which was discussing the details of the bill and the ‘ more amazing by the minute ’ stance @entity5 ’s @entity8 base has on the bills			1
@entity50 pointed out the hypocrisy that @entity5 ’s republicans were calling for smaller government , but were fully supportive of requiring women to get a medically unnecessary ultrasound			1
del. @entity73 , a @entity74 , spoke on the show about the repercussions of the bill and what it would mean for @entity5 women seeking abortions			1
mr @entity7 told the @entity9 floor : ‘ it was trans - v this , and trans - v that			1
’ ‘ the show ’s over , and she looks at me and goes , “ i got ta go to bed			0
” ’ he told the @entity9 floor : ‘ if the gentleman ’s plan was to make sure there was one less @entity8 in this world , he did it			0
’ his tawdry monologue was met with several cheers and guffaws as well as applause			0
the bill has sparked outrage separate from the @entity50 show – from spoofs on @entity101 and @entity102 to a protest outside of @entity104			2
lampooned : on last week 's snl , @entity105 and @entity106 also poked fun at the bill it originally required women seeking an abortion to undergo a trans - vaginal sonogram , in which a wand is inserted in the vagina to yield an image of the fetus			1
the bill originally required women seeking an abortion to undergo a trans - vaginal sonogram , in which a wand is inserted in the vagina to yield an image of the fetus			1
the procedure differs from an abdominal sonogram – often portrayed in movies and tv shows - in which a wand is rubbed over the woman 's belly			0
seven states have laws mandating some form of pre-abortion ultrasound exam			0
the @entity136 , which researches abortion - related issues , said none of the ultrasound laws in other states explicitly require the trans - vaginal procedure			0
however , @entity142 , @entity143 's state issues manager , said several of the laws , including a @entity146 measure recently upheld in federal court , effectively leave doctors with no option but the trans - vaginal procedure			0
that 's because an abdominal sonogram does not produce the detailed image of a first - trimester pregnancy that is required by some of the laws , ms @entity142 said			0
the procedure differs from an abdominal sonogram – often portrayed in movies and tv shows - in which a wand is rubbed over the woman 's belly			0
in part because of public ridicule , the bill is now being offered in a watered - down format and is supported by @entity5 gov. @entity167			1
gov. @entity167 and @entity52 state lawmakers abandoned a bill last wednesday requiring women to undergo an intrusive type of sonogram before an abortion - an abrupt reversal that demonstrated the power of political satire and illustrated again how combustible the issue of women 's reproductive health has become over the past few weeks			1
' you never want to get on the wrong side of popular culture , ' said @entity184 , a professor at @entity186 's @entity185 told the @entity187			0
in @entity5 , the bill began muscling its way through a legislature that recently came under the rule of @entity52 conservatives			1
it moved ahead despite an outcry from women and @entity196 , including a female lawmaker who called it ' state - mandated rape ' and another who made her point with a failed amendment requiring rectal prostate exams for men seeking @entity206 prescriptions			1
it did n't fully jump the fence from politics into pop culture until @entity101 lampooned it on saturday			0
' really ? ' comedian @entity106 sneered in noting the @entity5 bill on @entity101			2
' do n't get me wrong , @entity214 is my favourite airline			0
i have so many miles on @entity216 that they upgrade me to ladybusiness			0
' where are the women ? a photo of the all - male @entity221 panel swept the internet after a hearing on february 16 men talking about women 's rights : @entity221 member rep. @entity226 , left , talked with rabbi @entity228 on february 16 @entity229 wisecracked that ' @entity230 ' was the name of a jazz fusion band he once saw in concert			2
and conservative columnist @entity234 , daughter of 2008 @entity52 presidential nominee @entity235 , said on @entity236 that she is ' pro-life , but i 'm not pro-vaginal probing			1
' she added : ' i 'm just horrified by this bill			2
as a @entity8 woman , i 'm horrified			0
' earlier last week , more than 1,400 people — mostly women — locked arms in protest outside the @entity104 , and petitions bearing more than 30,000 names were presented to @entity167 by women 's groups			2
gov. @entity167 , a @entity249 political protege of religious broadcaster @entity250 who has been mentioned as a possible vice-presidential candidate on a ticket with @entity255 , backed down on wednesday , saying : ' mandating an invasive procedure in order to give informed consent is not a proper role for the state			0
' he said he supports legislation that would require pre-abortion sonograms , but not the invasive variety			0
