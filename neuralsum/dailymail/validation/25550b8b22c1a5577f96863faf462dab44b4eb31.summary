teenagers are tired of sharing every detail of their lives online and are taking increasing steps to safeguard their privacy on social media , a report has revealed			1
young people are un-tagging pictures , writing false posts and even adopting parallel identities in a bid to keep their personal information safe , according to the @entity14			1
they have even resorted to posting deliberately vague statements on their accounts - known as ' vague - booking ' - to prompt real friends to respond privately for further details			1
the report , by @entity34 of the @entity35 , says the rise of apps like @entity38 - which erases pictures after a short amount of time - show teenagers are increasingly concerned about what strangers see			1
his report says : ' there is an almost universally held view that teenagers simply do nâ€™t care enough about online privacy			2
' at face value , this appears to be true , as many young people flood public social media accounts like @entity53 and @entity54 with endless streams of selfies and personal information			2
mr @entity34 cites the example of @entity59 , who was forced to resign from her position as the country 's first youth police crime commissioner in 2013 after a series of ill - advised tweets she had posted years before emerged			0
@entity29 founder @entity28 claimed people had become more comfortable with sharing private information online @entity67 , chief executive of the @entity14 , told @entity68 that she estimates a third of @entity53 users have a private account , only shared with close friends , as well as a public persona			1
she had many used several fake identities for things like video gaming , while closely guarding accounts made using their real names			2
ms @entity67 said the findings will pose problems for businesses , who will not be to take consumers for granted			0
mr @entity34 adds that just because young people post things in public forums , it does not mean have no desire for privacy			1
' just because it 's in a public space does n't mean they want publicity , ' he said			0
his views are in stark contrast to those of mr @entity28 , the chief executive of the world 's biggest social network			0
speaking at the @entity100 in 2010 , he claimed people had grown more comfortable sharing their private information online			1
he said : ' people have really gotten comfortable not only sharing more information and different kinds , but more openly and with more people			0
' that social norm is just something that has evolved over time			0
' he explained the rise of social media reflected the changing attitudes of people			0
' when i got started in my dorm room at @entity116 , the question a lot of people asked was , ' why would i want to put any information on the internet at all ? why would i want to have a website ? ' ' then in the last 5 or 6 years , blogging has taken off in a huge way , and just all these different services that have people sharing all this information			0
