but judging by the reaction to this latest portrait of the @entity3 , the painter should have aimed for a simple likeness			2
for while @entity4 describes his work as ‘ imposing ’ and ‘ expressionist ’ , his crueller critics said it resembled a ‘ drag impersonator ’ of the @entity3 or her @entity25 puppet			1
the ' expressionist - style ' painting was revealed at the @entity5 - the home of @entity28 sport - but was criticised as being a ' hideous cartoon ' by the many rugby fans it is there to please			0
artist @entity4 , the youngest person ever to paint the @entity3 , said he tried to ' get beyond her public image ' , but the monarch 's 133rd portrait has not been warmly received			1
it comes just months after the duchess of @entity39 ’s first official portrait was unveiled and , art critics were , unusually , largely united in their condemnation , calling it : ' ghastly ... rotten ... an out and out disaster			0
’ the @entity3 's new picture will be permanently housed at @entity28 's national stadium after being painted by the @entity6 born artist			1
@entity4 ’s portraits of @entity50 veterans @entity51 and @entity52 were recently displayed at @entity53 and are now a permanent feature in the @entity55			2
this latest portrait was produced after @entity4 attended a sitting with the @entity3 late last year in the @entity58 at @entity53			1
it is described as “ an imposing three - quarter study painted on a 5ft by 4ft canvass in an expressionist style			0
' but critics have found other ways to describe it			0
standing proud : @entity67 president @entity66 , @entity67 chief executive @entity68 , first minister of wales @entity69 and artist @entity4 at the unveiling in @entity6 today brave face : the duchess of @entity39 after viewing a new portrait by @entity75 of herself at the @entity76 in central @entity77 , which was roundly panned @entity78 , 38 , said : ' i ’ve never seen a royal portrait like that			1
it is a shocking portrayal - she looks like a caricature of her @entity25 puppet			1
' @entity86 , 32 , said : “ @entity3 ca n’t be happy with that - it is shocking ' , and @entity89 , 24 , said : ' it is a real shocker and a disaster			2
' diversity : the artist 's other subjects include first world war veteran @entity51 and @entity96 happy : @entity97 , 32 , is the youngest artist to paint a monarch and the 133rd artist to have sat with her , which he says is about getting beyond her public image home of @entity28 sport : the portrait will be hung in the @entity5 in @entity6 for the fans to see as he unveiled it , welsh first minister mr @entity69 had only warm words			1
' in commissioning a @entity28 artist for this work , and providing a permanent home at the iconic @entity5 , the @entity67 are recognising the important role they play in our culture and showcasing it to the world , ' he said			0
' this is a fantastic piece which thousands of people visiting the stadium every year will have the chance to enjoy			0
' @entity4 , 32 , is the 133rd artist to have sat with the @entity3			1
he said the final image is “ literally larger than life ” - and was “ particularly keen to reflect the humanity of his subject			0
” ' to have been granted a sitting with @entity3 is an ambition fulfilled and it has been an enormous privilege to be asked to create this work			2
' as anyone who has ever met @entity3 will know , it is simply awe inspiring to be in her presence and i wanted to relay that feeling as well as showing the very human side to the @entity3 ’s personality			2
' the @entity5 is the pulsing heart of @entity28 and is the best possible place to home for the portrait ; amongst all the hopes and dreams of the nation			0
' @entity4 graduated from art school in 2003 and has exhibited in the @entity76 , @entity141 and @entity142 since			0
he said : ' it ’s a very rare opportunity for any artist to take on , but it can also make or break an artist ’s career			0
