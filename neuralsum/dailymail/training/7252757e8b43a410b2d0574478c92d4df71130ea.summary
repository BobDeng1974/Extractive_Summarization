@entity0 face a major striker crisis after @entity2 cast uncertainty over his future and indicated that promises of playing time have been broken			1
the 29 - year - old is unhappy about the lack of starts he was given following his arrival on a @entity12 transfer from @entity13 in the summer			1
that situation has changed in the wake of @entity17 ’s £ 25m move to @entity18 , but the striker has surprised and angered @entity0 staff by speaking out on sunday about his frustrations			2
@entity2 , up against @entity23 's @entity22 on saturday , has cast doubt over his @entity0 future the comments come just days after @entity2 ’s agent claimed @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29 are interested in the @entity31 international			1
@entity32 has previously insisted he has no doubts about @entity2 ’s commitment to the club , though the striker appears increasingly receptive to the idea of a quick move on from the @entity39			1
@entity2 is quoted in @entity31 as saying : ' i have been approached by clubs			2
when @entity17 was here , it was also planned that i should play a certain number of games ... that was n't the case			0
‘ today , i ask myself many questions			0
i need time to think			0
it 's very difficult to accept to spend my time on the bench			0
‘ i do n’t know what will happen			0
me leaving ? it is possible			0
’ interest in @entity0 striker @entity2 is rising after @entity53 and @entity54 entered the chase @entity56 now faces a huge dilemma , with his only other senior striking option being @entity59 , who is currently on loan from @entity61			1
the @entity0 manager went to significant lengths last week in talking down previous comments from @entity2 that indicated he was unsettled			2
but the issue has resurfaced with curious timing , considering @entity17 ’s departure and the fact he has started @entity0 ’s past four games			2
@entity2 only started two @entity71 games in the first six weeks of the season following his move from @entity31			1
the @entity74 forward reportedly has a £ 8million buy out clause in his contract at the end of the season			0

the 29 - year - old striker has started @entity0 's last four matches
@entity2 has only *scored* one @entity71 goal this season
@entity0 boss @entity32 's only other senior striking is @entity59
