the @entity0 shed 0.0001g last century , leading scientists to come up with a more accurate measure of mass it ’s a problem that has been weighing on scientists ’ minds for years – how to redefine and accurately measure the kilogram			1
currently the unit of measurement is based on a metal cylinder - which should weigh precisely 1,000 grams - that is kept under lock and key in @entity14			1
but the cylinder is gradually losing mass , leading @entity18 researchers to look for a new formula to create the most accurate definition of a kilo			1
the @entity0 shed 100 micrograms ( 0.0001g ) last century , which although is around the weight of dust particle , means the official kilogram is becoming slowly less accurate			1
scientists at the @entity18 @entity26 ( @entity27 ) in @entity28 have come up with an ingenious way to create a more exact measure of mass , which involves counting the number of atoms needed to make up a kilogram , instead of relying on a piece of metal			1
but in order to win the international race to redefine the kilogram , they must perfect the method by developing the world ’s roundest sphere			1
@entity43 , head of the @entity27 's kilogram project , said : ' our goal is to have @entity27 master the realisation of the future kilogram completely anonymously			2
’ after years of research , they have created a method of making incredibly pure circular crystals made from tiny vortices of silicon gas			2
from incredibly pure silicon , they are able to grow a flawless single - crystal whose inner structure is completely regular and without fractures			0
the company said : ' both being free of impurities and having a regular structure are preconditions for the success of the experiment			0
' ' from the round - bodied , cylindrical single - crystals , @entity27 produces crystal spheres that are rounder than anything else in the world			0
’ scientists at the @entity18 @entity26 ( @entity27 ) in @entity28 have come up with an ingenious way to create a more exact measure of mass , but they first need to perfect their technique by counting the atoms in the world 's rounded spheres ( pictured ) the aim is ‘ to produce the connection between the mass of the sphere and the mass of an atom , ' by counting the atoms			1
physicist @entity86 told @entity87 : ‘ we work out the number of atoms in the sphere , weigh the sphere and therefore work out how much an atom weighs			1
’ this mathematical method has enabled the mathematicians to discover the @entity97 constant			0
the company said : ' already at this point , @entity27 scientists miscount only twice every one hundred million atoms			1
kilograms of different materials are based on the measurement of the @entity0 ( @entity0 )			1
‘ the kilogram is the unit of mass ; it is equal to the mass of the international prototype of the kilogram , ’ according to @entity112 ( @entity112 )			2
the cylinder , which is meant to weigh exactly a kilogram , has a diameter of 3.9cm			2
the cylinder , which is meant to weigh exactly a kilogram , has a diameter of 3.9cm			2
it ’s made from an alloy that is 90 per cent platinum and 10 per cent iridium			0
an illustration of the cyclinder is shown it ’s made from an alloy that is 90 per cent platinum and 10 per cent iridium			0
it ’s been looked after in @entity14 by the @entity112 since 1889 and replacements have been made to maintain its accuracy			0
the unit of mass is disseminated throughout the world via ‘ official copies ’			0
‘ with these copies and via further transfer standards , we teach weighing instruments how heavy a kilogram is , ’ @entity27 scientists explained			2
but the official @entity0 has shed 100 micrograms ( 0.0001g ) in the last century , prompting experts to find a more exact way of defining the kilogram			1
‘ at worst , the international prototype of the kilogram could be destroyed or stolen all of a sudden [ if an alternative is n’t created ]			0
then the definition would be lost for all time , ’ the @entity27 said			0
‘ the goal is to miscount only by one atom for every one hundred million atoms			0
’ the method could be used to work out how many atoms are needed to make up a kilogram , but leaves the challenge of counting how many atoms make up an object			1
in the case of the sphere , it is possible because the 3d shape is composed of a regular crystal lattice			0
the researchers who created the sphere know the dimensions of the sphere and the individual layers of lattices , so they are able to calculate the number of atoms by dividing the larger dimension by the smaller one			2
they believe they will have the answer in 2018 .			0

@entity0 shed 100 micrograms last century
kilogram measurement is set from the *highly* - *guarded* metal cylinder
@entity18 scientists are working out how many atoms are in a certain sphere
method should allow them to redefine the kilo based on the mass of atoms
