job shortage : a fifth of graduates are unemployed or in unsalaried or low - paid posts six months after leaving university , official figures reveal the research by the @entity23 paints a sobering picture for young university leavers who have spent at least three years studying and have built up large debts			1
it shows many are emerging into a hugely competitive job market where they may wait years before securing meaningful employment			1
the trebling of tuition fees last year to a maximum of £ 9,000 has created the prospect of thousands of students leaving university in two years with debts of £ 40,000 or more once living costs are added - and no prospect of starting to pay it off for the foreseeable future			1
details were released at the same time as a @entity44 report warned too many sixth formers were being pushed into the ‘ default ’ university route instead of considering vocational courses and on - the - job training			0
key industries such as manufacturing , construction , it and engineering face a recruitment crisis as a result , it said			0
of the 190,000 full - time first degree leavers in 2011 - 2012 who took part in the @entity23 survey , more than 17 per cent said they had continued studying			1
two - thirds said they were working - but barely more than half were on permanent @entity65 per cent said they had taken basic , unskilled work such as manning rubbish trucks or sorting mail			1
two per cent were doing internships , 1.3 per cent were involved in voluntary work and 2.7 per cent classified themselves as other / unknown , a category which includes ‘ developing a portfolio ’			1
another five per cent had opted to travel or do ‘ something else ’			0
opportunities for university leavers have shrunk by four per cent since last year , according to a survey by the @entity77 earlier this month			0
crisis : opportunities for university leavers have shrunk by four per cent since last year , according to a survey by the @entity77 earlier this month banking and finance has seen 45 per cent of jobs evaporate , while accountancy and professional services firms have 17 per cent fewer vacancies			2
at the same time the pay premium gained from higher education is being eroded , creating a double whammy for graduates			2

now that is down to 27 per cent			0
@entity96 president @entity95 said : ‘ many of those entering the work - place for the first time are finding it hard to find a job that matches their skills			1
‘ those taking their first step on the career ladder are willing to work hard and pay their dues but employers must stop exploiting them through things like unpaid internships			2
’ the @entity44 report called for a university admissions - style system to be set up to help more young people apply for apprenticeships and vocational courses			0
this is needed to prevent a chronic shortage of suitable workers as it estimated the majority of posts created between now and 2020 will be in high - skilled jobs			2
‘ what is now seen as the “ default route ” of an undergraduate degree is not suitable for all - young people have different talents and learn in different ways , ’ the report said			0
‘ we should aim to inspire but also be realistic , setting out the costs and likely return on options open to young people , including the vocational options that have long been undersold			0
’ policy director @entity137 added : ‘ we need to tackle the perception that the a-levels and three - year degree model is the only route to a good career			0
‘ when faced with a £ 27,000 debt , young people are already becoming much savvier in shopping around for routes to give them a competitive edge in a tighter job market			0
