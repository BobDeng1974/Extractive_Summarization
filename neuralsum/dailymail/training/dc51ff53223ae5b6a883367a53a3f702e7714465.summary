countless numbers of children have marvelled at how a homemade boat made of folded paper can float on water			1
and now engineers have created a giant origami version that can carry an adult			0
unlike the simple toy that 's constructed using a single piece of paper , they also used glue and sticky tape to create the lake - worthy vessel , which measures ( 12feet ) 3.6 metres long			1
unlike the small handmade boats crafted from a single piece of folded paper , the giant version was made using glue and sticky tap to make the lake - worthy vessel , which measures ( 12ft ) 3.6 metres long weighing in at 220 lbs ( 100kg ) and measuring six feet ( two metres ) wide , the boat was made from 305 feet ( 93 metres ) of paper measuring three feet ( 1.1 metres wide ) – the length of a football pitch – as well as 492 feet ( 150 metres ) of sticky tape and two gallons ( 10 litres ) of glue , to keep it waterproof			1
engineers selected paper that is stronger and more water - resistant than usual , because the boat was to be in the water for much longer than a normal small - scale version			2
they also made modifications to the traditional design			0
weighing in at 220 lbs ( 100kg ) and measuring six ft ( two metres ) wide , the boat ( pictured ) was made from 305 ft ( 93 metres ) of paper – the length of a football pitch – as well as 492 ft ( 150 metres ) of sticky tape and two gallons ( 10 litres ) of glue , to keep it waterproof pupils from @entity48 school ( pictured ) helped to launched the giant paper construction on @entity50 in @entity51 to mark the 50 day countdown to the annual @entity53 length : 12ft ( 3.6 metres ) width : 6ft ( 2 metres ) weight : 220lbs ( 100kg ) amount of paper used : 492ft ( 150 metres ) amount of stick tape used : 492ft ( 150 metres ) amount of glue used : 2 gallons ( 10 litres ) to ensure it did n’t capsize , a keel of wood was added underneath the boat , while a polystyrene block supporting the pyramid of paper was added for safety			1
ridged paper in the base of the boat created a platform strong enough for someone to stand on			2
pupils from @entity48 school helped to launched the giant paper construction on @entity50 in @entity51 to mark the 50 day countdown to the annual @entity53 , which promotes careers in science , technology , engineering and mathematics			1
the project was intended to show them that even the humble paper boat can be super-sized using engineering techniques capable of making it strong enough for a human			2
@entity87 , an award - winning engineer who is a direct descendent of @entity90 , captained the boat on its maiden voyage			1
the craft stayed in the water for two hours and is still intact , despite having a soggy bottom - but no - one is sure exactly how long it could survive			2
it is said to have ' handled like a dream '			0

‘ engineering runs in my family , and i really want to show young people that this career can open doors to amazing opportunities and adventures , ’ she said			0
‘ from creating a huge origami boat , constructing a new skyscraper , or designing an aeroplane , so many things we travel on , live in or use in our everyday lives involve engineering			0
’ year 10 pupil @entity132 , 15 , from @entity48 , @entity51 said : ‘ it was cool to see how they managed to make a huge version of the kind of paper boats you can make at home			1
i did n’t even realise that was something engineers could do ! ’ similar stunts will feature at the @entity53 @entity145 @entity144 , which will take place at @entity147 , @entity148 from 11 - 14 march 2015			0
there are also instructions of how to make a small scale version of the origami boat			0
to ensure it did n’t capsize , a keel of wood was added underneath the boat , while a polystyrene block supporting the pyramid of paper was added for safety			0
these modifications kept ms @entity87 ( pictured ) dry			0

paper boat was *reinforced* with glue and 492 ft ( 150 metres ) of sticky tape
it weighs 220 lbs ( 100kg ) and is intact after being in the water for two hours
it was launched on @entity50 in @entity51 by pupils from @entity48 school and ' handled like a dream '
boat was captained by a direct descendant of @entity90
stunt marks 50 days until the start of @entity180 in @entity148
