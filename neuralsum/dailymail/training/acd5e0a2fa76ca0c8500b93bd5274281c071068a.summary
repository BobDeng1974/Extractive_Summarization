by @entity0 with its vast indoor platforms , raised glass - panelled walkways and giant , futuristic pillars it is a far cry from the scene that greets @entity9 's rail passengers on their current daily commute			1
the striking image is an artist ’s impression of plans by a global engineering and design consultancy to transform @entity18 railway station into an ‘ urban icon for a modern , vibrant city ’			1
@entity21 has been appointed to redevelop the 86 hectares that the station covers and make the site fit for 21st century travel			1
' urban icon ' : the computer - generated plans for the new station include vast indoor platforms , raised glass - panelled walkways and futuristic , sweeping white pillars outdated : the new design is a far cry from the current @entity18 railway station where passengers have to wait outdoors on crowded platforms the proposed station - which is covered by a white ceiling and dotted with trees - will feature 18 platforms and handle in excess of 500,000 rail passengers per day			1
the company hopes to completely transform the current overcrowded site , which travellers on @entity44 complain is ‘ chaotic ’ , ‘ dirty ’ and ‘ dangerous ’			2
just last week , the @entity45 announced controversial plans to hike rail fares and freight rates to pay for much - needed investment in the country 's loss - making rail network			2
finance minister @entity52 told people who were protesting against the fare rises : ' @entity9 must decide whether it wants a world - class railway or a ramshackled one			0
' @entity21 ’s designs were revealed today as part of the consultancy ’s @entity60 report in which it outlines its predictions on how technology will change the way we travel in 35 years ’ time			1
the company said it wanted to ‘ challenge people ’s thinking ’ and ‘ focus on the forces shaping the future of rail ’ , including rising passenger numbers and the effects of climate change			2
overcrowded and in need of reform : passengers have described @entity18 station as ' chaotic ' , ' dirty ' and ' dangerous ' a ticketless future : gate - lines in the futuristic stations will be removed and payment processed automatically when the journey is taken the report includes research into driverless trains and intelligent robots , which would help to build rail infrastructure , along with drones , which would carry out maintenance on rail lines			1
swarm robotics - a theory based on behaviour among ant and bee colonies - could see small robots working collaboratively on major railway repair and structural testing			0
monitoring drones would enable rail operators to perform advanced maintenance and carry out safe inspection of bridges , tunnels and tracks			0
@entity21 claims that the new technology could even eradicate journey delays and track closures			2
human staff could also be a thing of the past with the introduction of automated systems , driverless trains and ticketless travel			1
crumbling infrastructure : the @entity9 government is set to raise train fares in order to fund much - needed investment in the country 's rail network stretched to the limit : @entity18 station is one of the busiest in @entity9 and many of its trains are overcrowded sleek design : the @entity129 's extended nose section is described as ' one of the most extreme in the world ' and will help the train reach a speed of 360kph the company - which has also worked on high - speed rail projects in @entity136 , @entity137 and @entity138 – claims driverless trains speed up rail travel because they increase the average train speed			1
it reported that trains can operate closer together , reducing the time it takes a train to slow down at stations , and increasing reliability			0
@entity149 , @entity150 , @entity151 , @entity152 and @entity153 all currently operate driverless passenger trains on selected lines , along with @entity157 ’s @entity156 ( @entity156 )			0
in addition , tickets could become a thing of the past as @entity21 predicts travel that is entirely electronic and tracked by wearable devices			2
gate - lines in stations will be removed and payment processed automatically when the journey is taken			0
rail stations will also be powered by new forms of energy			1
electricity will be generated from passengers ’ footsteps , which will then provide power to the station , while trains will rely on alternative forms of fuel including liquefied natural gas ( @entity181 ) , hydrogen and even algae			1
by 2050 it is thought that hydrogen , or hydrail , could be a primary means of powering trains			0
changing how we travel : @entity21 's designs were revealed as part of the consultancy 's @entity60 report ambitious : @entity194 's @entity193 would see people transported between cities inside aluminium pods travelling at speeds of up to 1,300km per hour the report imagines a future where train passengers can contact friends , family and colleagues via " @entity205 " - holographic image displays - and train windows will adjust automatically to prevent external glare			1
virtual shopping walls – which are already in operation in @entity211 and @entity212 - will be located in railway stations and even carriages , enabling passengers to purchase products from the wall displays via their mobile devices			1
the company also revealed how high - speed trains could look in the future , using an artist ’s impression of the @entity129 train designed by transport consultancy @entity225			2
the double - decker train features an extended nose section , which the consultancy describes as ‘ one of the most extreme in the world ’ and will help the train reach a speed of 360kph			0
new forms of transport could also emerge , including ambitious concepts such as @entity194 ’s @entity193			0
@entity194 ’s design would see people transported between cities inside aluminium pods travelling at speeds of up to 1,300km per hour			0
stockng up on the go : passengers will be able to buy groceries from virtual shopping walls located in railway stations @entity21 's global rail leader @entity244 said : ‘ the global urban population is growing rapidly and , by 2050 , around 75 per cent of the world 's population will live in cities			1
‘ this places huge pressure on transport infrastructure and resources , but also creates a significant opportunity for rail , which relies on passenger density to function most effectively			0
the challenge will lie in juggling the responsibility of providing reliable travel for millions while simultaneously tailoring each journey for the individual			0
' however , by rapidly developing technology and taking bold steps to overcome capacity and cost challenges through maximising efficiencies , the rail renaissance can deliver a future where rail is the backbone of our travel system , linking major urban hubs and feeding into multi-modal transport networks for the benefit of the passenger			2
’ virtual world : the shopping walls are already in operation in @entity211 and @entity212 where passengers can buy products from wall displays via mobile devices @entity283 , the acting general secretary of transport union the @entity285 , said : ‘ this report and its proposals are just dangerous nonsense straight out of some barmy work of science fiction			1
‘ the notion of an entirely de-staffed railway with track workers replaced by drones could only have been cooked up by someone miles out of touch with reality			0
’ he continued : ‘ the @entity285 is discussing our continued fight against axing guards and gate - line staff at our conference in @entity304 this week			0
‘ any train company thinking of looking at the proposals in today ’s report should be warned that they will face stiff industrial and political resistance from the @entity285			0

the futuristic design was revealed today as part of @entity21 's @entity315 report
the design consultancy says it wants to transform the station into an ' urban icon '
the new site will feature 18 platforms and handle over 500,000 passengers a day
other predictions made in the report include driverless trains and ticketless travel
in the future , rail stations could be powered by @entity181 , hydrogen and even algae
passengers will be able to make ' @entity205 ' and browse virtual shopping walls
