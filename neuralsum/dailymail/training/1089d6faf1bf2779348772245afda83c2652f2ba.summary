by @entity0 and @entity1 from the front , her short summer dress looked like a perfectly suitable choice for a star - studded day at the polo			0
but this unfortunate woman might have done well to take a twirl in front of the mirror before she stepped out into the sunshine with the royals … because from the back , it was a rather different story			0
the mystery blonde showed off slightly more than she intended when her dress rode up as she walked with prince @entity17 through @entity18 in @entity19			1
but if she realised what had happened , she took it in her stride , laughing and joking with the royals			0
and while prince @entity49 headed off soon after the event finished – possibly to attend to the absent @entity50 and @entity51 – @entity17 was happy to linger and chat to the young lady			1
in one of their first public appearances together since @entity55 ’s wedding , the princes put on a good show , winning yesterday ’s match and losing just 5 - 4 in the last few minutes of what was described as a ‘ nail - biting ’ game on saturday			2
the @entity62 ( left ) and @entity17 ( right ) at @entity63 near @entity19 , in a charity match during the second day of the @entity43 the two - day event is expected to raise tens of thousands of pounds for three charities including the @entity68 cancer hospital in @entity69 and while the @entity35 may not have been present to watch them compete , they had the next best thing in the form of their on - screen grandmother			1
dame @entity31 , who won an @entity33 for her portrayal of the @entity35 in the 2006 movie of the same name , shared a joke with @entity17 , 29 , and @entity49 , 31 , before cheering them on from the sidelines			1
also among the 300 attendees at the exclusive invitation - only event were @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 and @entity88			0
it raises tens of thousands of pounds for charities which are close to the princes ’ hearts , including the @entity68 cancer hospital in @entity69 , the youth training charity @entity93 and the @entity96 fund @entity94			0

the @entity115 nation has the third - highest hiv infection rate in the world - a third of its children are orphans and more than 37,000 children under 14 are living with the disease			0

an array of a-list stars were in attendance , including @entity147 series stars @entity148 and @entity150 , who two were in high spirits as they watched the men on horses battle to score in each other ’s goals			0
the pair wore stylishly in - sync outfits : accents of white , cream , beige , and brown - but they were n't the only chic stars to make it			0
