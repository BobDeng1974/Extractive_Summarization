@entity0 have one of the best vantage points in the world to watch the stunning ‘ blood moon ’ lunar eclipse on wednesday , with astrophysicists promising it will be even more spectacular than last time			1
on april 15 , armchair astronomers watched the first of four total lunar eclipses , part of a four - stage event , known as a ' @entity11 ' , that is also believed to mark the beginning of significant events – even the @entity15 - in some religions			1
the awe - inspiring spectacle occurs when the @entity19 's shadow passes over the moon - and on wednesday the second eclipse will happen higher up in the sky promising a more dazzling sight			1
‘ this time it ’s going to start higher in the sky , on april 15 the moon was low down close to the horizon but this time it will start about a third of the way up from the horizon so when it ‘ s red we will see it much higher and brighter in the sky , ’ astrophysicist dr @entity33 told @entity34			1
’ with a small pair of binoculars people will also be able to spot @entity56 about ‘ two moon widths away ’ from the the blood moon			2
dr @entity33 advised to look out for a ‘ bluey green dot ’			0
weather permitting , @entity38 , @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62 will all have great views of the blood moon , while @entity64 , @entity65 and the @entity66 will miss out			2
in this photo people watch as the ' @entity70 ' rises over the water in @entity72 , @entity73 , on april 15 a blood moon occurs when the moon passes in to the shadow of @entity19 called the umbra it is described as the ' simultaneous occurrence of all sunsets and sunrises ' in @entity38 , dr @entity33 said that ‘ anywhere down the @entity86 ’ is the best place to view it , while people probably wo n’t be able to see the whole of it in @entity38			1
‘ they might just see the end of it , ’ he said			0
in @entity38 the lunar eclipse will occur on wednesday night at the following times : @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 : @entity96 begins 8:15pm			1
@entity99 : @entity96 begins 7:15pm			0
@entity102 : @entity96 begins 7:45pm			0
@entity105 : @entity96 begins 6:45pm			0
@entity38 : @entity96 begins @entity108 ( moonrise )			0
the eclipse will happen two more times over the next two years as part of this cycle , on april 4 and september 28 , 2015			1
the next @entity11 cycle wo n't occur until 2032			2
‘ if we were on the moon during this eclipse , we would see a bright orange - red ring in the sky where the @entity19 should be			1
the light from that bright ring bathes the moon in a reddish glow , which we can see from @entity19			2
some @entity126 are concerned that the celestial event could mark the start of terrible events , based on a passage from the @entity131 that says : ' the sun shall be turned into darkness , and the moon into blood , before the great and the terrible day of the @entity136 comes			0
' in 1493 , the first @entity11 saw the expulsion of @entity138 by the @entity139			0
the second happened in 1949 , right after the @entity140 was founded and the most recent one - in 1967 - happened during the @entity141 between @entity142 and @entity140			0
@entity143 , a @entity144 pastor who has written a book on the @entity11 called ' @entity146 : something is about to @entity148 ' told the @entity149 that the first of the blood moons in 2014 took place right in the middle of the @entity138 holiday of @entity155			1
dr @entity33 said that ' anywhere down the @entity86 ' is the best place to view it the second , on october 8 , occurs during the @entity158 and the third will be on april 4 , 2015 , also during @entity155			1
the final one happens on september 28 , 2015 , which is also during the @entity162			1
a lunar eclipse occurs when the moon passes in the shadow of @entity19			1
this is an area known as the umbra , where light from the sun is blocked by our planet			0
the light refracts differently in the atmosphere and , as it hits the moon , it appears red			0
this gives rise to its ‘ blood red ’ appearance during a total eclipse , when the entire moon is in shadow			2
if it skirts the shadow , known as a partial or penumbral eclipse , the effect is less dramatic			0
when the moon first enters the @entity19 's partial shadow , know as the penumbra , a dark shadow begins to creep across the moon			2
this gives the illusion that the moon is changing phases in a matter of minutes instead of weeks			0
at the eclipse 's peak , the moon enters the @entity19 's full shadow ; the umbra			1
at this stage , the @entity19 's atmosphere scatters the sun 's red visible light ; the same process that turns the sky red at sunset			2
as a result , the red light reflects off the moon 's surface , casting a reddish rust hue over it .			0

a ' blood moon ' occurs when the moon passes in the shadow of @entity19
it is the ' simultaneous occurrence of all sunsets and sunrises '
the second ' blood moon ' of a four - stage @entity11 will happen on wednesday
the first one was on april 15 but it appeared low on the horizon
this time the lunar eclipse will appear higher and brighter in the sky
@entity0 , especially , those living on the @entity86 will see it best
the final two ' blood moons ' of this @entity11 will happen on april 4 and september 28 , 2015
