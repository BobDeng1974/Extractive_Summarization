by @entity0 in @entity1 i watched yesterday as convoys of exhausted @entity5 soldiers returned from the battle to save @entity7 from a ruthless onslaught by fanatical jihadist fighters			1
the weary men told shocking stories of vicious , hand - to - hand fighting with @entity14 militia – and of innocent civilians caught in the crossfire			1
@entity17 - the @entity17 - have swept mercilessly through @entity5 and now have the capital in the grip of a vicious pincer movement			1
as the battle for @entity7 loomed , the @entity32 yesterday ordered aircraft carrier @entity34 to move to the @entity36 for possible air strikes against the militants , while @entity40 president @entity39 suggested the two traditional enemies may work together to defend @entity5 , saying : ‘ when the @entity32 takes action against [ the militants ] , then one can think about cooperation			1
’ at a checkpoint near his base at @entity48 on the @entity49 , @entity50 shouted down to me yesterday			0
‘ things are very bad up there but we are ready for it			0
this is our country and our people			0
we can defeat the terrorists , ’ he said			0
several armoured jeeps and @entity61 donated by the @entity32 military were being towed , disabled in fire - fights with jihadists who have seized tanks , weapons and even @entity61 as their spoils of war in @entity69 and @entity70			1
motorists hooted their horns and waved in support at the young soldiers returning to the @entity76 ’s base at @entity48			1
shocking : the @entity5 forces told how ' crazy ' jihadists would stop at nothing to hold on to their recent gains volunteers : thousands of @entity5 men in @entity7 queued for hours to sign up to fight the @entity17 militants ‘ we have better equipment and training than the jihadists but they are crazy and ruthless ’ , said soldier @entity84			1
‘ they do n’t care about dying so they have no rules , they do n’t just want to take the town , they want to destroy us and all the civilians			0
these men have no mercy			0
’ the regular army , shamed by recent reports of hundreds of troops in @entity69 city abandoning their posts , is putting on a convincing show of patriotism and professionalism in an all - out bid to save @entity7			1
here in the city its five million war - battered residents , all but engulfed by the aftershock of seeing major cities fall into @entity17 hands last week , are finally showing signs of an organised fightback , though many international analysts believe it may be too late			1
tens of thousands of volunteers , many of them veterans of @entity5 ’s numerous wars , are flooding into the national army ’s recruiting centre and signing up for an intensive two weeks in training camp before heading into conflict with the militants			1
takeover : @entity17 militants have set up their black flag above towns and cities across the north and west of @entity5 elderly @entity133 , a construction worker dressed in traditional dish - dash , waited in line at the @entity136 in @entity138 suburb			1
like many others , he was giving up his saturday to stand in the heat and dust of the old airport to file his details in a disused prefab office hastily set up to register the recruits			0
mr @entity133 stated that he was answering a call to fight to the death			0
‘ our religious leader @entity148 has called on all of us to protect @entity7 , ’ he said			2
‘ i am strong and fit and proud to answer the call along with so many of my fellow countrymen			0
terrorists will never rule our land			0
’ as he spoke , more men young and old were dropped off by cars and taxis at the busy road junction where they introduced themselves to soldiers on duty and then took the steep road down from the highway to report for service			2
the eldest daughter of fallen dictator @entity163 has praised @entity17 ’s bloody attacks in @entity5 , saying she is happy to see their ‘ victories ’			1
@entity166 , 47 , ( below ) who lives in luxurious exile in @entity169 ’s capital @entity170 , has said the fighters are aided by former military chiefs and soldiers who supported the @entity174 that lay behind her father ’s regime			1
in posts in @entity179 on her @entity181 page , miss @entity166 appears to address her father , saying : ‘ your men and women have answered the country ’s call , and they are coming to @entity7			2
’ in a post yesterday , she said : ‘ @entity7 , we are returning with @entity191 ’s help			1
’ her comments come as @entity17 overran villages in the province of @entity195 , 50 miles north - west of @entity7			1
she also spoke to the @entity197 newspaper , saying : ‘ i am happy to see all these victories ... some day i will come back to the rebel cities and read @entity200 [ a @entity202 chapter ] over my father ’s soul			2
’ the current @entity5 government has charged miss @entity166 with offences including the financing of terrorist groups – crimes that could lead to the death penalty			2
the army ’s mission : to prevent the total collapse of an @entity5 still tottering from the @entity32 - @entity215 invasion which removed their despised dictator @entity163 in 2003 but which also dismantled its proud military , disenfranchised its @entity220 minority , and fomented deep sectarian rifts			1
the vacuum created by @entity32 ’s military departure in 2011 has been filled by a jihadist movement more deadly than @entity225 itself			0
@entity17 leader @entity226 has declared he wants to convert @entity5 and neighbouring @entity227 to @entity14 states under @entity231 law			1
he told his followers in a video last week : ‘ continue your march as the battle is not yet raging in @entity7			1
we have a score to settle there			0
’ as the estimated 7,000 jihadists carry out a ruthless killing spree with horrific reports of beheadings , summary executions and even crucifixions in the towns they have overthrown , they have been joined enthusiastically by @entity247			2
@entity5 government forces have in the meantime been joined by rogue militias such as the @entity251 , led by @entity252 , and its affiliated group of murderous thugs , the @entity255 , which means @entity256			2
and there were reports last night that some @entity215 @entity259 are heading to @entity5 to fight against @entity17			1
political analysts predict that this factionalism spells the end of @entity5 as a cohesive country , and that if @entity7 falls the subsequent division of @entity5 will be even more tragic than the @entity266 ’s invasion			1
but that might be to underestimate the tenacity of the people of @entity7			2
they found a way to accommodate @entity163 ’s repressive regime , building decent lives and businesses around it			0
they withstood an unwarranted invasion which saw definitive insults inflicted on them			0
at the heavily - armed chicane leading into the fortified @entity280 created for @entity32 ’s safety and comfort in the centre of their city , they tolerated a sign stating : ‘ if you enter here you will be shot			0
’ yesterday , while a newly - imposed 10pm to 6am curfew outlasted dawn over the city of minarets , there was an obvious increase in military checkpoints but otherwise it was business as usual			1
i sensed that , with its cruel history , @entity7 had seen too much to be able to respond in any other way			2
hapless president @entity301 , roundly blamed for his government ’s lack of direction and inability to pinpoint areas of potential trouble , has failed to bring home a vote to declare a state of emergency			0
insurgency regularly results in explosions in some troubled suburbs where @entity220 and @entity259 still clash			0
there were two such explosions last week			0
but the good people of @entity7 are not gearing up to leave			2
at our hotel , the manager was bemused at the idea of an exit plan			0
‘ this is a safe place , ’ he said			0
‘ the @entity324 and @entity325 embassies are both based in this building			0
we want you to stay and enjoy this lovely city .			0
