by @entity0 published : 17:14 est , 10 july 2013 updated : 05:01 est , 11 july 2013 as her husband @entity2 tore into the wrapping paper of his 50th birthday present , @entity1 tried to suppress a giggle			2
she had spent weeks racking her brain over what to buy him			2
but how do you surprise your husband after 15 years of marriage ? a unique piece of artwork was just the thing , @entity1 decided			2
but as @entity2 pulled off the bubble wrap , it quickly became clear this gift was not your run - of - the - mill watercolour			2
it was a life - sized bronze cast of @entity1 's bottom , in suspenders and a tiny thong			1
cheeky : @entity1 with the bronzed bust of her bottom that she gave to her husband as a birthday present ' @entity2 's mouth dropped open , then spread into a huge smile , ' says @entity1 , 40			2
' he could n't believe it , but he did look at me and say , “ very nice			2
” our daughter @entity32 , 19 , thought it was fantastic , but our 13 - year - old son @entity2 just stared and said , “ what is that ? ” ' so what possessed @entity1 to commission such an intimate portrait of her posterior ? @entity1 , who lives in @entity41 , @entity42 , and runs a turbo engine manufacturing company with her husband , says : ' @entity2 is very difficult to buy for , so when i spotted @entity46 , it gave me an idea			2
' i wanted something a bit naughty , so decided on a cast of my bottom			1
' turning body parts or personal objects into art is becoming a major trend - over the past few years it has rocketed in popularity , particularly in showbusiness			1
@entity61 's @entity60 judge @entity59 recently admitted she has a cast of her bottom hanging in her bedroom - which was made at the request of her husband @entity66 in 2006			1
bottoms up : @entity1 with a brass cast of her impressive derriere			1
turning body parts or personal objects into art is becoming a major trend @entity72 posted pictures of herself on @entity74 in 2011 plaster casting her own baby bump when she was pregnant with daughter hero , now two			1
casting finally went a-list when the @entity79 reportedly spent £ 1,000 having daughter @entity81 's tiny hands and feet cast and plated in gold after she was born			1
sir @entity83 , @entity84 and @entity85 are also said to be fans of the technique and are all thought to have commissioned their own or their children 's plaster casts			1
plaster casting has been used since the 19th century to create exact replicas of ancient sculptures , but it has now been replaced by alginate , a blue seaweed - based substance similar to the putty used by dentists to take moulds of your mouth			2
it sets in two minutes , then turns rubbery , so you just pop a baby 's foot - or a woman 's bottom - into it then pull it out when it 's firm to form a mould			2
this is then filled with the chosen material : brass , plaster , bronze , glass , fibreglass , silver or , if you have the cash , gold			2
@entity1 opted for fibreglass , to make it light enough to hang on a wall , which was then covered with powdered bronze			2
the entire thing cost £ 2,000			1
eternal connection : @entity126 ( with daughter @entity127 , 2 ) wearing a silver pendant replica of the end of her daughter 's umbilical cord for the process itself , @entity1 had to strip down to her undies before @entity135 and then alginate was spread over her bottom , lower back and legs while she stood stock - still for 40 minutes			0
her mother and daughter kept her company throughout			0
' i was very nervous beforehand , so it really helped to have them there			0
it turned out to be fun once i got over my nerves , although it was agony , as i could n't move an inch or it would spoil the cast			1
' the result , she said , was a pleasant surprise			0
' i was paranoid it would look awful , so i could n't believe how much i liked it , ' she says			0
' it 's not obscene , just cheeky , and @entity2 loves it			0
i think we 're going to hang it in the lounge			0
i ca n't wait to see people 's reactions at our next dinner party			0
' @entity167 has created casts for numerous celebrities through her company @entity170 - she 's rumoured to be the creator of @entity172 's golden feet - and has seen many unusual requests			1
' one client 's husband proposed to her with a ring woven from grass , so she had it cast in silver as a permanent reminder			1
another has a piece of bubblegum that she was chewing when she first kissed her husband when they were 14 - that 's now mounted on a silver ring			0
' i 've even cast a shard of wood that was stuck in a man 's knee after an accident : he wanted a reminder of how lucky he was to be alive			1
' one of the most unusual requests came from 42 - year - old artist @entity126 , who came up with an unlikely memento of her daughter @entity127 's birth two years ago			0
she asked @entity167 to create a silver pendant replica of the end of @entity127 's umbilical cord , still in its medical clip			0
family link : @entity126 's umbilical cord pendant ' it 's individual to us , which makes it all the more precious , ' says @entity126 , who lives in @entity209 , @entity210 , with her partner @entity211 , 41 , an insurance broker			0
' the cord was a bit gruesome , it shrivelled up and turned black , but i kept it because it represented my life flowing into our daughter			0
cast in silver , it really has a magical quality			1
it 's all about capturing a moment in time			0
' this seems to be the key to the popularity of casting - preserving a physical memory for ever			0
perhaps that 's why body casting has become so popular with women in their 30s , 40s and 50s , eager to capture an image of their body before age takes its toll			1
@entity61 body caster @entity237 , who opened @entity46 in 2006 after working in special effects on films such as @entity241 , says : ' ninety per cent of my body clients are female			1
they tend to be slightly older , partly due to having fewer body hang - ups , and partly down to cost			1
' the average spend is probably £ 1,000			1
you can spend £ 25 on a pair of lips , but the full body cast i 'm doing for an @entity254 client will cost more than £ 10,000			1
' trained sculptor @entity237 says breasts , bottoms and female torsos are favourites with customers , but he is keen to point out that casting is not all salacious or sexual			0
a moment captured : body caster @entity237 with @entity263 , holding the plaster cast of hands clasping each other he says that he provides as a ' cradle to grave ' service			1
' the most disturbing thing i ever cast was the hand of a baby who had been stillborn at full term , ' he says			1
' i never met the family - it was done in the funeral parlour with just me and the funeral director			0
' it 's become increasingly common for families to ask for casts of loved ones who have terminal illnesses			1
i cast my own father 's hand holding a wine glass before he died of prostate cancer , so i can still say “ cheers ” to him now			1
' another moving experiences involved casting the clasped hands of a husband and wife while she was in a hospice dying of cervical cancer			0
her widower , @entity294 , 42 , is a community psychiatric nurse who lives in @entity295 , @entity296 , with his daughter @entity297 , 17 , and son @entity237 , seven			0
his wife @entity263 was diagnosed aged 34 with a rare , aggressive form of cancer in october 2007			0
she died a year later			0
during @entity263 's final days , @entity66 heard @entity237 talk on local radio about body casting and arranged for him to visit			1
precious memory : @entity237 showing @entity263 the finished product , the bronze - plated cast ' it was such an overwhelming experience , ' says @entity66			1
' it was so tactile , our hands clasped together - it felt like getting married again			0
it was a little moment of light in an awful year			0
' he says that he still remembers the look on @entity263 's face when she received the bronze - plated cast the next day			1
' the smile that lit up her face was unbelievable , ' says @entity66			0
' the cast sat by her side until she slipped away a day later			2
' people take it for granted , holding hands , but sometimes there is nothing more powerful			0
' five years on , the cast is in @entity66 's living room in a display case , next to glass casts of his two children 's hands			1
' it 's a comfort to have them there , ' says @entity66			0
' looking at them transports me back to that moment with @entity263 more than a picture ever could			0
' ' moment of light ' : @entity263 saw the bronze cast a day before she died			2
now @entity66 has something to remember her by			0

getting casts of body parts or personal objects is increasingly popular
sir @entity83 , @entity85 and the @entity79 have all done it
a pair of lips costs as little as £ 25 , but a full body cast is a *whopping* £ 10,000
