@entity0 showed yet again that they are competitive but they are still not unleashing the full potential of this group			1
our traditional strengths are all there and in many ways we fronted up really well			0
the front five , the scrums , the lineout are going well			0
it ’s outside that we have problems — we are not playing enough real footballers in the backs to take on @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 , which has to be the goal			1
@entity19 's side have a host of problems with the backs lacking an x-factor to take on big teams @entity0 captain @entity24 shows his disappointment after their defeat by @entity15 the @entity0 team are not a development team			1
we ca n’t go on talking about our young inexperienced players at this level			2
it ’s totally irrelevant , it ’s a decision that @entity0 are making and they must not be putting caveats in place			2
have we got players who can go head to head with the world ’s best ? yes , absolutely			0
but in the back division we are not currently playing in a way that will consistently pose these big teams problems			0
we are either not picking the right players or not picking the right combination of players in the positions where they can cause the most damage			1
@entity0 's big men are helpless as @entity48 kicks a field goal late on to clinch victory for the @entity15 more experienced players - different options - are available all across the team : @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity56 , to name just three			1
there are a whole bunch of more experienced players out there			0
we keep getting close on the scoreboard but in the cold light of day there is still a gap			0
the @entity0 coaches have got to be more clear on how they see @entity0 playing the game			2
what to do now against @entity68 ? there is talk of changes but what i would do is pick the ‘ @entity76 ’ xv that @entity0 want to start against @entity14 , which has now become an absolutely must - win game			1
that might well involve a few changes but @entity0 should not make switches of personnel just for the sake of it			2
this is actually not the time to experiment or rest players by some pre-planned strategy			0
now is the time to pick the team you expect to beat @entity14			1
@entity19 should make those changes because he has a vision of the team he wants to run out against the @entity14 in two weeks ’ time			1
@entity54 , behind @entity94 and @entity95 at fly half in the pecking order , has attacking flair @entity99 's @entity55 and @entity100 ' @entity56 are among a host of experienced players available if they pick the core of this team again i would tighten things up , kick for the corners more , turn teams with kicks and try to pin the opposition in their 22 for huge chunks of the game			1
ruthlessly use the strength of the pack and their ability to control a game			0
personally i would always go for a more attacking option because against the very best i have always felt you need that but there is not a right or a wrong selection , there is just the selection that works			0
at this level there is only one thing on which you are judged : did you win or not ? but @entity0 have got to start being very clear in what they are looking for			2
centre @entity132 crosses for a late try for @entity0 after they moved the ball wide @entity136 had a tough day at the office in his 50th test match it was care 's pass that gifted @entity141 the only try of the first half i am increasingly impressed with @entity145 and @entity146 in the @entity0 front row and on this occasion i ’m opting for @entity145 , who is developing very quickly indeed at loose head in the absence of the injured @entity152			1
@entity0 ’s scrum has been reassuringly rock solid so far this autumn against @entity16 and @entity15 and that is a great base for a team to work off			1
@entity0 prop @entity145 ( left ) impressed alongside @entity146 with the scrum rock solid @entity0 have also done well in the line - outs - they lost just one i can remember on saturday - so @entity145 is clearly supporting his jumpers well there			1
his all - round contribution has been excellent and what i particularly like about the @entity145 we are seeing this season is that he seems to have reined in what used to be a short fuse and his entire focus is going into the game			0
my champagne moment there 's only one real contender and that is @entity173 ’s wonderful try more or less straight after the second half began , which put the @entity15 in the box seat			1
the skill of @entity48 ’s chip ahead off the outside of his right foot was exquisite while @entity180 is such a consummate player that you always fancied him to catch it on the full and make ground			0
and then it got even better			0
he waited and waited to draw the @entity0 defence , then released @entity173 at exactly the right moment for a score that would grace any highlights reel			2
it was a breathtaking moment that demonstrated what @entity15 can do and why they are the @entity194 team in the world			2
referee @entity196 rightly sends @entity197 to the bin @entity196 had a mixed game when it came to the big calls , in my opinion			0
he got the yellow card absolutely right with @entity197 after reviewing the big screen			0
those sorts of yellow cards really annoy a coach - it was unnecessary			2
@entity0 were winning the ball anyway , routine ruck possession , but when you ruck these days the movement of the foot has to be backwards , not down			1
but @entity214 and his team got the call against @entity218 soon after badly wrong when he clearly fielded the ball with one foot in touch			0
it should have been a lineout back in @entity0 ’s half , @entity15 throwing in			1
instead it was an attacking lineout for @entity0 in @entity15 ’s half and it led directly to @entity0 ’s first try			1
it was a big momentum changer and i have no idea why @entity214 did not ask for @entity228 on that one .			0

@entity0 lost 28 - *31* to @entity15 at @entity2*31* on saturday
it was @entity19 's side 's fifth consecutive @entity235 defeat
@entity239 - winning coach *sir* @entity238 said @entity0 are either not picking the right backs or combination of players to get the job done
@entity0 should pick the ‘ @entity76 ’ xv for @entity68 as practice for @entity14
