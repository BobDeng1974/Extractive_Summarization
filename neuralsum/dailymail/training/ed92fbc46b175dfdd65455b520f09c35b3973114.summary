@entity1 archaeologists have unearthed a giant complex near the ancient city of @entity4 in southern @entity5			1
the area is believed to have been home to @entity8 , father of @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11			2
as the find is 4,000 years old , roughly the same age as @entity8 himself , it raises the tantalising possibility of a direct link with one of history 's most significant religious figures			1
dig : archaeologists at work on a site in @entity5 near the ancient city of @entity4 believed to be 4,000 years old the large city was discovered by a team from the archaeology department of @entity28 , led by @entity29			1
the site is roughly the size of a football field , around 80 metres on each side			0
complexes of that size from @entity35 are extremely rare , according to dr @entity29			0
one of the most extraordinary archaeological items discovered at the site is a clay plaque of a worshipper approaching a sacred site dressed in a flowing robe			0
exquisite : this clay plaque from the site shows a worshipper in a flowing robe approaching a sacred place progress : this is the first time in three decades that @entity1 archaeologists have been able to work in @entity5 the dig is a rare example of good news stemming from the invasion of @entity5 , as it is the first @entity1 excavation in the country for nearly 30 years			1
as @entity55 was increasingly cut off from the international community it became more difficult for scholars to entry the country			1
and in the early years following the @entity62 invasion of the country , conditions were far too unstable to allow archaeological work			2
civilisation : this image of a ram is one of many exquisite objects found near @entity4 during previous excavations the @entity71 culture of 4,000 years ago is already well known for creating the conditions for the first cities to thrive			2
exquisite objects from the area include the @entity76 , a mosaic picture now in the @entity78			0
@entity8 is said in the @entity79 to have been born in a city called @entity4 before travelling towards the @entity81			0
it is unclear whether or not this city should be identified with the @entity71 civilisation of @entity85 .			0
