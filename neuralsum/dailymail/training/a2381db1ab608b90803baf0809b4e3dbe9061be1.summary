by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 host commentator so there you have it , folks			0
@entity7 and @entity8 will play second - leg home ties as they take on @entity10 and @entity11 respectively			1
former @entity13 striker @entity12 will line up for the @entity15 side against the @entity16 ... that 's all from me here folks			2
get back to the homepage for post-draw reaction , but make sure you return for the @entity23 draw at midday where @entity24 and @entity25 find out their play - off opponents			1
champions route @entity11 vs @entity30 vs @entity31 vs @entity32 vs @entity33 vs @entity34 league route @entity10 vs @entity36 vs @entity37 vs @entity38 vs @entity39 vs @entity40 ties to be played on the 19/20 and 26/27 august @entity10 vs @entity8 @entity42 vs @entity43 @entity44 vs @entity45 @entity46 vs @entity47 @entity48 vs @entity40 @entity11 vs @entity7 @entity49 vs @entity50 @entity51 vs @entity52 @entity53 vs @entity54 @entity55 vs @entity34 ... so that means @entity8 fans will have to wait for a minute or two , while @entity7 supporters will now find out who their side will face in the play - off round			1
... but first , we will watch highlights of @entity65 's win over @entity66 in last season 's final			0
oh , and @entity69 will also describe how the draw works on stage first - which is fair enough i guess			1
no , not the draw itself ( that would be too easy			0
) but @entity69 general secretary @entity76 is now on the stage and he is now briefly giving us a speech about how the @entity79 pitches the best teams in @entity69 against each other ... thanks for that , @entity76			2
the draw should be underway shortly ( or at least the presentation ) as final touches are being applied in @entity87			2
@entity69 do tend to drag these things out so expect the @entity69 general secretary to give a short speech after he arrives at 11am			0
well , if we are counting the play - off round that is			1
@entity92 was sacked as @entity24 boss half - way through last season , with @entity24 ' top four ambitions in pieces before @entity98			0
but it 's the @entity100 boss who will be looking ahead to compete with @entity69 's elite this term as manager of @entity43			0
being seeded in the non-champions section along with @entity8 , he will avoid the @entity16			1
it 's dead simple folks			0
balls for the seeded and unseeded teams will be placed in separate bowls			0
a ball will be drawn from each and placed into an empty pot. there , the two balls will be shuffled and picked out , with the first team drawn to play the first leg of the two - legged tie at home			1
remember the @entity23 route and the @entity123 route are kept apart throughout the draw			0
@entity125 routeseeded : @entity8 , @entity47 , @entity43 , @entity45 , napoliunseeded : @entity40 , @entity46 , @entity44 , @entity42 , @entity10 champions routeseeded : @entity49 , @entity53 , @entity52 , @entity34 , @entity127 : @entity54 , @entity11 , @entity55 , @entity50 , @entity51			1
many @entity8 fans would favour a clash with @entity40 , but @entity130 has already warned supporters it would be a far from easy clash			2
@entity8 will be huge favourites regardless of who they get in today 's draw , but @entity130 is not getting complacent			2
' i would n't be very pleased if we had to face them ( @entity40 ) but you do n't know			0
we 're in this position because we could n't do the business as we had to in the league at the end , and you need to pay a price			0
' this is a tricky one and i want us to be ready because for us to play @entity79 is vital			2
' hold on to your hats			0
before we start talking of a possible @entity151 clash between @entity8 and @entity7 - both sides will be kept separated for the draw			1
@entity8 's play - off route that takes them through a league route ( non-champions ) while @entity7 will feature in the champions side of the draw			1
by my calculations , the @entity159 champions will be seeded too , which is bad news for @entity54 who will become an unseeded team			0
i will confirm that soon			0
well , what a start to the morning ! despite being given a 6 - 1 aggregate hiding by @entity166 on wednesday , @entity7 have been given their place back in the @entity79 after the @entity169 champions fielded an ineligible player			1
you can find out more details about that on the above link			0
you can feel the big time of the @entity79 is getting closer as the @entity177 now begins its interest in the competition for the 2014 - 15 season			2
@entity8 will find out who they have in the play - off round following the draw in @entity87 this morning , but they not be the only @entity185 team to feature ... follow @entity187 's coverage of the @entity79 draw as @entity8 find out who they face in the play - off round of the competition			1
the @entity16 ' fourth place finish in the @entity177 last term means they have to play a qualifier to reach the group stage , and they could face one of @entity40 , @entity46 , @entity44 , @entity42 or @entity10 in a two - legged tie			1
we will bring you all the coverage from the draw which is set to begin at 11am from @entity87 .			1

@entity8 enter @entity79 in play - off round
@entity16 could have faced @entity202 , @entity46 , @entity44 , @entity42 or @entity10
