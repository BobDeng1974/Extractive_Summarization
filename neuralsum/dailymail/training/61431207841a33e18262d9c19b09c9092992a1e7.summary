by @entity0 published : 11:08 est , 12 august 2013 updated : 04:14 est , 13 august 2013 ' bemused ' : the @entity1 today criticised the decision to give pc @entity3 his job back after having sex while on duty in @entity8 , @entity9 an armed policeman who had sex with a married woman while on duty has been allowed to keep his job because his gun was within reach – attached to the trousers which were around his ankles			1
@entity4 @entity3 , 36 , was on patrol when he picked up a woman in an armed response vehicle and took her back to his house for 40 minutes while his colleague waited outside			1
@entity3 was later sacked for gross misconduct after the woman ’s husband found out about the afternoon liaison and reported his love rival to police bosses			1
but the award - winning officer was reinstated after an appeal ruling that his gun was never out of his control and he would have been able to respond to an emergency			1
yesterday the decision to give @entity3 his job back was criticised by the @entity1			1
head of the @entity1 in @entity33 , @entity34 , said he was ‘ bemused ’ by the findings of the @entity36			1
he said : ‘ the finding that the gun was never out of @entity40 ’s direct and immediate control because it was in a holster , attached to his trousers , which were attached to him , albeit around his ankles , is surprising			1
’ he continued : ‘ i am also bemused by the panel ’s conclusion that his conduct did not significantly downgrade the protection to the public because there was nothing to suggest he could not have been back in the police vehicle within a minute or two			1
‘ these findings can only undermine public confidence in the credibility of the police discipline system			0
’ mr @entity34 also said the way @entity62 dealt with a complaint about @entity40 from the husband of the woman he had sex with was ‘ unacceptable ’			1
@entity40 was on duty in @entity8 in april 2010 when he invited the woman , who he knew , to his home for sex			2
an investigation by @entity62 initially resulted in a final written warning but when the @entity1 told the force to treat @entity40 ’s actions as gross misconduct he was sacked			1
however in april 2012 he successfully appealed against his dismissal and was reinstated			0
@entity40 had already won a bravery award when he was caught having sex on duty			2
and after being reinstated he won a chief constable ’s @entity79 for bravery after clinging for over an hour to a suicidal woman who was threatening to jump off a railway bridge			2
despite his awards mr @entity34 said @entity40 ’ behaviour and the force ’s handling of the complaint against him were ‘ unacceptable ’			0
he said : ‘ any officer having sex on duty is unacceptable behaviour that falls well below what is expected of all police officers			0
‘ those who carry firearms are rightly subject to the highest standards of training , procedures and discipline			0
‘ the manner in which this complaint was originally handled by @entity62 is unacceptable and their attempts to “ fast - track ” the complaint and deal with it outside the formal regulations are not good enough			2
’ criticism : a panel at @entity62 ( @entity111 pictured ) gave the pc his job back because they believed he had control of his gun and could have left the tryst if there was an emergency a spokesman for @entity62 responded : ‘ we note and fully accept the findings of the @entity1 report which was critical of the @entity123 ’s handling of a complaint against a serving officer			1
‘ our complaints handling processes have been reviewed and improved as part of our on - going efforts to ensure we provide the best possible service to the public			0
’ earlier this year a married @entity132 was jailed for seven years for misconduct in public office after he engaged in sexual affairs while he was supposed to be on uniformed patrol			0
@entity138 , 40 , would track down phone numbers and addresses of women while on duty using the database with @entity145 and @entity146 police			0
the father - of - two had affairs with four women before and during his policing shift – sleeping with one lover up to ten times when he was on duty			2
he was found guilty in march of neglecting his duties after it emerged he would turn his police radio down on shifts while having sex with women , as well as encouraging one mentally ill woman to send explicit pictures of herself on email to the police station			0
he was convicted of sleeping with four women and illegally accessing data relating to three lovers on the @entity166			0
in the same month police officer @entity167 , 45 , was jailed for nine months after he had sex with a vulnerable woman he met on duty			0
the married father had helped the woman on two occasions while working as a pc with @entity173 .			0
