@entity0 left for a three - day @entity2 swing tuesday afternoon without saying a single word in response to a terrorist video showing the beheading of @entity7 , the second @entity8 journalist to die that way on camera			1
the president 's departure came amid equally deafening swirls of helicopter rotors and tough questions about whether and when the @entity8 will strike back in a meaningful and public way against @entity17 , the self - proclaimed @entity18			1
news of @entity7 's execution broke online at 1:05 p.m. , shortly after @entity22 press secretary @entity21 began his daily briefing with reporters ; he said four minutes later that he had n't heard the news			0
by 3:40 , @entity0 was lifting off from the @entity26 of the @entity22 on his way to a waiting @entity28 , which was ' wheels up ' by 4:00			2
just two weeks ago , the president was widely criticized for being pictured fist - bumping on the golf course minutes after solemnly addressing the nation about an @entity17 video showing photojournalist @entity35 's death			1
he took off in his private @entity43 at 4:00 p.m. news of @entity7 's execution broke at 1:05			0
in a hurry : the president jogged up the steps to @entity28 on tuesday , less than three hours after the gruesome scene of @entity7 's death was broadcast globally via social media walk on by : @entity0 strode to @entity39 , his personal chopper , without acknowledging shouted questions from reporters about how he 'll respond to @entity7 's beheading			1
the helicopter took him to @entity28 as @entity0 's chopper left the @entity22 on tuesday , @entity57 posted video of an interview with @entity61 , the deputy @entity8 assistant secretary of state for @entity62 and @entity63 , who said @entity8 should ' stay tuned ' for a reaction from the @entity0 administration			1
the @entity8 is ' developing a broad regional coalition , a broad international coalition , working to get a new @entity62 government stood up , working to get our plans in place , ' @entity61 said			2
' ' you can not just go in militarily and start dropping bombs and hope that it 's going to work out , ' he said			0
' you have to have a very sophisticated approach to this			0
' ' we are building now a broader campaign plan that we ’ll develop over the days and weeks ahead , ' he told @entity57			1
the remark sounded like an affirmative echo of what @entity0 himself said five days ago , admitting that he had n't decided whether to expand his anti-isis airstrikes beyond the borders of @entity62 and into @entity88			1
' we do n’t have a strategy yet , ' he said then			0
@entity57 's @entity90 seemed out of patience on tuesday			2
' you say " stay tuned , " she snapped at @entity93 , ' but in the meantime @entity17 is busy beheading our colleagues , threatening more of them , massacring people on the ground and conducting the kind of brutality that we have n't seen in a long , long time			1
' shortly after @entity61 finished his interview , @entity0 strode past reporters on his way to @entity39 without acknowledging them			1
' no questions could be heard above the helicopter engine and no answers were given by the president , ' according to a @entity22 pool reporter			0
the @entity107 , meanwhile , tried to drown out the bad news with press releases about a ' global sports mentoring program , ' a groundbreaking ceremony for the @entity112 , ' and the ' 5th @entity113			0
' after an eight - hour flight , @entity0 will wake up in @entity115 for multilateral talks before continuing to @entity117 for a @entity119 summit			1
he will be accompanied by a subset of the @entity22 press corps , as he was on @entity122 when his golf game became international news			0
barely ten minutes after reading a resolute @entity126 message from a makeshift podium following @entity35 's beheading , the vacationing @entity0 was at the first tee			2
the photos that emerged hours later angered @entity8 who saw the commander - in - chief 's grins and fist - bumps as a sign of disrespect while the dead journalist 's family mourned			2
@entity139 released tuesday by the self - proclaimed @entity18 ( @entity17 ) showed @entity8 journalist @entity7 ( @entity140 ) next to an unknown jihadi shortly before his execution by beheading getaway chopper : once out of earshot of the press corps , @entity0 boarded @entity39 for a 15 - minute flight to @entity42 and a waiting @entity28 ride to @entity115 members of @entity149 from the political left and right showed tuesday that they are growing weary of the @entity22 's slow - developing approach to combating @entity17			1
republicans especially – but with @entity154 softening – are demanding a plan to crush the group in its @entity88 safe haven			2
' mr. president , ' @entity159 @entity158 tweeted on tuesday , ' if you ca n't come up with a strategy , at least tell us what the goal is			0
' @entity8 senator @entity166 , a @entity168 @entity167 , added on @entity169 that ' we need to send a clear message to the @entity171 and the rest of the world			1
there 's only one way you deal with @entity17 : you kill them			1
' @entity179 chairman @entity178 , a @entity180 @entity167 , told @entity57 that the @entity7 video ' is exactly the reason why we have to go after @entity17 , why we can not just let them wreak havoc			1
' seasoned @entity186 @entity154 are beginning to question @entity0 's wait - and - see posture too			1
@entity178 's counterpart rep. @entity188 , who his the committee 's ranking @entity189 and a @entity191 , said he favored airstrikes in @entity88			0
' yes , i do , ' he told @entity57			0
' @entity17 is obviously across the [ @entity62 ] border , into @entity88 ... and they really have to be defeated , ' he said			2
@entity196 chair sen. @entity195 , a @entity180 @entity189 , told @entity197 on sunday that she has ' learned one thing about this president , and that is he ’s very cautious			1
maybe in this instance too cautious			0
' confusion : @entity107 official @entity61 said @entity8 should ' stay tuned ' for the @entity204 strategy that @entity0 said he did n't have last week a murderous trio of @entity207 militants linked with the cash - flush @entity209 army are believed to be responsible for the beheading deaths of @entity7 and @entity35 , and distributing gruesome videos showing the aftermath			1
' the intelligence community is working as quickly as possible to determine its authenticity , ' @entity215 spokeswoman @entity214 said from the @entity22			0
' if genuine , we are appalled by the brutal murder of an innocent @entity8 journalist and we express our deepest condolences to his family and friends			0
' at the @entity107 , a rattled spokeswoman @entity225 confused the executions of @entity35 and @entity7			0
' we certainly consider this act , this reported act , the act of the killing of @entity35 , as a horrific terrorist act			0
' if the video is genuine , ' @entity225 said , ' we are sickened by this brutal act , taking the life of another innocent @entity8 citizens			0
' asked if the @entity0 administration will regard @entity7 's execution as an ' act of war , ' she refused to say			2
' we certainly – i 'm not going to put new labels on it , ' @entity225 said .			0

@entity245 walks to @entity39 past journalists while ignoring their shouted questions
@entity107 's chief @entity62 - @entity63 deputy said ' stay tuned ' for a strategy : ' we are building now a broader campaign plan '
@entity57 anchor *pounces* : ' you say " stay tuned , " but in the meantime @entity17 is busy beheading our colleagues '
