by @entity0 published : 23:06 est , 6 november 2012 updated : 05:23 est , 7 november 2012 rep. @entity1 , the @entity2 lawmaker who took medical leave from @entity4 in june and has receiving treatment for bipolar disorder , last night coasted to easy re-election			1
however , his only campaigning has been by automated phone calls to voters			1
his celebration location , too , is a bit unorthodox – rather than revel in an upscale hotel room , @entity1 remains in the @entity14 in @entity15			0
easy win : rep. @entity17 won re-election to his @entity2 - area congressional seat while on a months - long medical leave mum 's the word : the rev. @entity23 , pictured last month , has been tight - lipped about his son 's condition @entity1 , 47 , has served in the @entity26 since 1995 , and beat out @entity28 @entity27 and @entity30 @entity29			1
@entity1 ’s win was generally expected , though the son of the @entity33 has n’t been seen in public in months while he ’s being treated for bipolar disorder			1
in his robo - call , which was sent out last month , @entity1 said that the recent events in his life were ‘ difficult to sort through			0
’ ‘ i am human , ’ the representative said in the automated call			2
‘ i am doing my best			0
i am trying to sort through ( all of my problems			0
) ’ competition : @entity28 @entity27 lost the seat for the 2nd @entity45 he has been compared to another absentee @entity2 politician , @entity46 , who also won a primary without actively campaigning			1
@entity1 , who is the son of civil rights leader @entity23 , left @entity4 with a vague statement this summer			1
' recently , we have been made aware that he has grappled with certain physical and emotional ailments privately for a long period of time , ' said @entity1 's staff in the statement			0
' at present , he is undergoing further evaluation and treatment at an in - patient medical facility			0
' according to the preliminary diagnosis from his doctors , congressman @entity1 will need to receive extended in - patient treatment as well as continuing medical treatment thereafter			0
' senator @entity59 compared @entity1 's disappearance to the marked contrast with the @entity28 senator for @entity63 , @entity62 , who kept the public updated following his stroke in late january			1
' i thought senator @entity62 ’s video talking about his rehabilitation answered hundreds of questions that i was facing , and i think to the satisfaction of @entity63 voters told them what his current situation is and what his hopes are about recovering , ' said @entity59			2
others questioned a profile appearing last month in the @entity79 about the reclusive lawmaker revealed a more erratic side of @entity1 political operative @entity82 speculated that @entity1 ‘ had a problem with reality , ’ adding that the @entity2 enjoyed hanging out at @entity84 baths ‘ prancing around in the nude			2
’ he also boasted that he was a reincarnated chariot driver , sources told the @entity79			0
winning : @entity1 and his wife @entity90 @entity89 thank family members at his election night party in march of this year in @entity2 after his @entity94 primary win over challenger @entity95 since @entity1 disappeared from public life , speculation has increased as to the possible reasons			2
the congressman has endured trying times over the past several years			0
a @entity101 also is investigating allegations that @entity1 was involved in discussions about raising money for former @entity63 gov. @entity106 's campaign in exchange for @entity106 appointing him to president @entity110 's vacated @entity109 seat			1
