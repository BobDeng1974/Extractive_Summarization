warm water is brewing in the @entity1 , resurrecting claims that a much - anticipated @entity3 may be on its way			1
@entity3 - a heating of sea - surface temperatures in the @entity1 - affects wind patterns and can trigger both floods and droughts in different parts of the globe			1
now , for the first time , scientists have mapped how flood risks change across the world when an extreme @entity3 hits the oceans			1
pictured is the percentage of land experiencing changes in flood volume with return periods of 100 years , during @entity3 years ( top ) and @entity28 years ( bottom ) their study shows how some areas are exposed to dangerous floods that can damage buildings , put people 's lives at danger , while other areas get a reprieve from drought			1
' a lot of scientific effort has been put into modelling physical hazards themselves , ' @entity41 , who led the new study told @entity46			0
' only much more recently have we started looking at the damage and being able to model that damage			0
' according to a report by @entity51 at @entity52 , the latest map was created using detailed hydrological models			0
pictured is the percentage of land experiencing changes in economic damages during @entity3 years ( top ) and @entity28 years ( bottom )			2
in @entity3 years , 10 per cent of the globe sees higher than normal damages , while 19 per cent sees lower than normal @entity3 and @entity28 are opposite phases of what is known as the @entity3 / @entity3 ( @entity3 ) cycle , says the @entity67			1
the @entity3 cycle is a scientific term that describes the fluctuations in temperature between the ocean and atmosphere in the east - central @entity1 ( approximately between the @entity74 and 120 degrees @entity75 )			1
@entity28 is sometimes referred to as the cold phase of @entity3 and @entity3 as the warm phase			2
these deviations from normal surface temperatures can have large - scale impacts not only on ocean processes , but also on global weather and climate			0
@entity3 and @entity28 episodes typically last nine to 12 months , but some prolonged events may last for years			1
they often begin to form between june and august , reach peak strength between december and april , and then decay between may and july of the following year			0
while their periodicity can be quite irregular , @entity3 and @entity28 events occur about every three to five years			1
typically , @entity3 occurs more frequently than @entity28			2
researchers at @entity91 's @entity90 compared the amount of flooding in @entity3 and @entity28 years to the average from all years between 1958 to 2000			2
the study also looked at its opposite phase , @entity28 , which occurs when winds in the equatorial @entity1 causes a shift to cooler than normal ocean temperatures			1
it found that 44 per cent of river basins around the world saw changes in 100 - year flood risks during @entity3 or @entity28 years			1
in one map , around 34 per cent of the world 's land area experiences a change in the amount of flooding in @entity3 years , compared to 38 per cent in @entity28 years			1
the biggest increases in flood risk were found in southwest @entity113 , parts of southern @entity115 and the @entity116			1
meanwhile , the @entity118 region of @entity119 and most of @entity120 saw the biggest decreases in flood risks			1
the researchers also looked at how the weather pattern cause economic damage caused by flooding			0
in @entity3 years , 10 per cent of the globe sees higher than normal damages , while 19 per cent sees lower than normal			2
the red colour in the map below shows regions where flooding decreases in @entity3 or @entity28 years			1
a darker the red , the lower the risk compared to normal			0
' there have been studies [ showing ] that some areas get more rainfall during @entity3 years , but more rainfall does n't necessarily mean more floods , ' professor @entity41 said			2
' so we 're looking at the actual flooding and damages caused by flooding			0
' these do n't always match an increase in rainfall			0
for instance , the southeast of the @entity113 is often cooler and wetter during an @entity3 , but the impact of flooding as a whole was n't severe			2
scientists recently suggested that @entity154 is about to be hit by eastward - moving waves of warm water , suggesting that @entity3 may be on its way			1
the most recent waves increase the chances that parched @entity160 could be in for some relief - albeit small - if weather patterns take a turn later this year			0
but @entity164 has warned that ' fickle ' @entity3 will likely be weak if it does appear , providing only limited relief for a drought - ridden west coast			0
strong @entity3 events occur every 20 years or so			0
on the left , the village of @entity169 , @entity170 , is seen flooded in january 2003 as a result of @entity3 rains , which drove 16,000 people from their homes			0
the worst @entity3 on record in 1997 to 1998 was blamed for massive flooding along @entity179 's @entity178 , right , that killed over 1,500 people kelvin waves of high sea level ( red / yellow ) are seen crossing the @entity184 at the equator			0
the waves may be due to @entity3 events			0
@entity188 indicates normal sea level , and blue / purple areas are lower than normal			0

@entity3 - a heating of sea temperatures in the @entity1 - affects winds and can trigger both floods and droughts
scientists have now mapped how flood risks change when an @entity3 and its opposite , @entity28 , hit the oceans
they found 44 per cent of river basins around world saw changes in 100 - year flood risks during these events
biggest increases in flood risk were found in southwest @entity113 , parts of southern @entity115 and @entity116
but it also found that the @entity118 region of @entity119 and most of @entity120 saw the biggest decreases in flood risks
