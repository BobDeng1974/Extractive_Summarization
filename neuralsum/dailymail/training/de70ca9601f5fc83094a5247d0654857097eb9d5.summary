@entity0 are still looking to add two new players to their ranks with @entity3 of @entity4 among the options for @entity6			1
the midfielder made his competitive debut for @entity4 three years ago and turns 25 on august 12			1
he has 78 first team games under his belt but has been targeted as one of the squad 's weaker links after failing to kick - on in the last year with any consistency			1
@entity0 manager @entity6 was widely credited with improving @entity3 while coaching him at @entity15 , where he played 25 games in 2010 - 11 , and the @entity17 is keeping a close on developments at @entity20			1
the midfielder did not excel against @entity33 but like many of the @entity4 players is enjoying his time under the new @entity45 coach			1
@entity0 have already splashed out in excess of £ 35m this summer with @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49 signed , while @entity51 's transfer from @entity52 is close			1
a loan deal for @entity55 's @entity54 has hit stalemate but is still on , yet a transfer for @entity3 would cost around £ 8million			1
@entity58 , @entity3 's first club , would also be due a percentage of any sell on			1
decision time : @entity29 will trim his @entity4 squad to 22 after their tour of the @entity34 statement of intent : @entity0 have already spent big on striker @entity47 this summer @entity66 happy with squad @entity6 may yet prefer to bring in @entity68 on loan from @entity70 or another striker but @entity3 's situation will be clearer by the end of next week			1
if they pull off two more deals without selling their stars it would be a huge statement of intent from @entity0			2
the concern at @entity4 would be that @entity6 could find the key to re-invigorating @entity3			1
@entity66 though will recruit in midfield and defence and has been pleasantly surprised by some of the other younger players ' performances			0
deals for @entity89 of @entity90 and @entity91 at @entity92 remain unlikely			0
@entity93 could mean city sales @entity96 's arrival at @entity97 has lifted hopes at other clubs that certain fringe players in the @entity103 champions ' squad will be be made available			1
@entity104 are among the front runners pushing for a deal with @entity107 while @entity108 remain eager to take @entity109 on loan			1
incoming : @entity96 's arrival on loan at @entity97 could lead to the departure of other players good impression : @entity109 has looked good on @entity97 's pre-season tour of @entity34 @entity117 has returned from the @entity118 to @entity55 only to be loaned out to the @entity119 with @entity120 and @entity108 want a defensive - minded midfielder to step in			1
@entity109 has only just joined from racing in @entity122 but showed on the @entity34 tour why @entity97 have brought him into their squad			1
@entity108 now hope to give him a season in @entity118 where he can continue to improve			2
however , they face competition for @entity109 from @entity127 , who are also among the clubs to have expressed an interest in @entity132 's defensive starlet @entity131			1
@entity135 ' @entity134 ' @entity133 @entity136 will hold further talks with @entity138 over winger @entity139 on tuesday			0
the 25 - year - old should certainly give @entity142 's team a better cutting edge as his nickname is ' @entity145 ' or ' @entity146 ' - although that moniker owes more to his hair than his rapier - swishing style on the wing			2
it is understood the nickname he actually prefers is ' @entity154 ' or ' the @entity155 '			0
negotiations : @entity136 manager @entity142 is close to sealing the signing of @entity139 whatever name he wishes to use , @entity138 sporting director @entity158 is keen to push a deal forward			0
they have agreed terms on @entity163 and are discussing a loan for midfielder @entity165 also			2
@entity139 's agent @entity166 said : ' the situation with @entity136 is active and we are waiting for the deal to go ahead			0
' although @entity170 born and raised , @entity139 has been capped by @entity171			0
he spent part of last season on loan at @entity175			0
@entity176 for @entity177 @entity179 midfielder @entity178 is due to hold talks with @entity177 ahead of a return to @entity182			1
@entity183 , who are playing a series of friendlies in @entity26 at the moment , have also shown an interest in the 27 - year - old			2
@entity179 manager @entity190 left @entity191 out of the club ’s pre-season tour to the @entity34 , leading his representatives to begin negotiations with @entity177 sporting director , @entity196			1
return : @entity179 's @entity178 is holding talks with @entity177 ahead of a possible return to @entity182 @entity179 remain on the trail of @entity201 's @entity200 and have made enquiries about the @entity203			1
defender @entity204 remains a target for @entity206 at @entity207			0
@entity208 have expressed an interest in @entity210 , whose wage demands in excess of £ 100,000 - a - week derailed a potential move to @entity132			2
those figures wo n't be easy for the @entity119 side to accommodate either although they have also asked about a deal for @entity55 's @entity217 who is on around £ 150,000			2
manager @entity190 said : ' unless there 's a concrete offer that we think is good for us and we want to do business , it does n't matter			0
even then , we 're in control - so all of that does n't matter , because it 's speculation - @entity210 's our player			2
' demands : @entity208 have shown an interest in @entity210 , but his wages could be a stumbling block @entity233 @entity234 will sign @entity235 and @entity236 from @entity237 on monday and loan the pair back			1
manager @entity239 remains keen to bring in another striker while a deal for @entity242 at @entity243 remains a possibility			0
the 23 - year - old @entity246 midfielder has long been in @entity234 's sights but he is keen to join a @entity249 team			1
if one of those does not come along soon , the greater the @entity251 's chances become			0
possible deal : @entity234 have been keen on @entity246 international @entity242 for a while @entity132 @entity256 deal @entity132 's search for a left - back should be concluded soon as talks progress with @entity261 over the £ 16m transfer of @entity263			1
@entity261 have enquired about @entity265 's 26 - year - old @entity264 as a potential short term replacement			2
@entity267 interested in @entity268 @entity267 's interest in @entity268 should help @entity270 offset their pending outlay on @entity272 and @entity273 from @entity274			0
@entity270 have no plans to sell @entity276 as part of their defensive restructuring but will continue to listen to offers for @entity281			0
@entity268 , 28 , is valued at around £ 6m by @entity270 although @entity267 want to pay around £ 3m			0
they are also looking to offload @entity283 to @entity284			0
@entity270 have no interest in @entity286 , who is looking more likely to return to @entity171 at this stage with @entity288 also looking at younger options			0
on his way ? @entity267 are willing to pay @entity270 £ 3m for @entity268 wednesday impressed by @entity291 @entity292 have offered @entity294 trialist @entity293 a short - term contract			2
the 30 - year - old defender , who has won six caps for his country and last played for @entity299 , has been training at @entity300 and played in some of their pre-season friendlies			0
manager @entity303 remains keen to sign a striker but @entity293 has also done enough to earn a deal			0
@entity303 said : ' we are offering @entity293 a short - term contract and hopefully he will be putting pen to paper for us			0
nothing has been finalised , he is mulling it over at the moment			0
' @entity312 heads to @entity313 @entity315 's young goalkeeper @entity314 is poised to join @entity317 side @entity316 on loan			2
the 20 year - old @entity319 impressed on trial on friday when appearing for @entity316 in a friendly against a @entity322 select @entity323			0

@entity0 are looking to add two new players to their squad
@entity3 was appointed captain by @entity29 in @entity33 friendly
but @entity26 midfielder could still be cut from @entity4 's 22 - man squad
