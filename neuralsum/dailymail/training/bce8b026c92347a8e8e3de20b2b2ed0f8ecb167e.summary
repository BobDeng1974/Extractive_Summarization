two fishermen captured scenes of sharks feeding in @entity4 waters worthy of the film classic @entity6 - all for just £ 5			1
instead of using high - tech safety equipment , the pair risked life and limb by shot the never - before - seen footage from the inside of a converted laundry trolley			1
@entity16 , 41 , and @entity17 , 46 , said they pushed their luck ' as far as we could ' as they whipped the blue and porbeagle sharks into a feeding frenzy			1
mr @entity17 filmed never - before - seen footage from a homemade cage of the fish in @entity4 waters dangerous : @entity17 was lowered into the water among dozens of sharks in just a converted laundry trolley damaged : the cage , which was picked up for free from a scrapyard , has been bent after an eight foot blue shark charged at mr @entity17 the unique footage has been added to an independent dvd about the underwater filming of fish in their natural environment			1
mr @entity17 , who was in the cage , experienced one nerve - wracking moment when an aggressive eight - foot - long blue shark rammed into the front of the trolley , making a large dent in it			1
the pair , from @entity52 , planned the dangerous shoot so they could be the first to film the lethal sharks in that state in @entity4 waters			2
mr @entity16 , from @entity58 , @entity52 , admitted they had concerns about the safety of mr @entity17			1
he said : ' we did ask ourselves how safe @entity17 would be in the cage			2
' we could n’t afford to do proper health and safety checks but we did a risk assessment beforehand and we decided to risk it			0
' video : the two fishermen shoot unique footage of sharks in @entity4 waters they recovered a 6ft tall , three - sided metal trolley for free from a scrapyard to use as a ' shark proof ' cage			1
the trolley was then fixed to the back a boat using a 30ft bungee rope , which they already owned			0
chicken wire - the only item they had to pay for - was wrapped around the front for added protection and three large floats were placed underneath to give it buoyancy			2
they charted a fishing boat to the @entity91 , an area where the @entity93 , @entity94 and @entity95 merge about 30 miles off the @entity97 coast			0
it is brimming with sharks that are said to be venturing further north in the hunt for food			0
mr @entity17 climbed into the cage wearing a wetsuit and snorkel and carrying a water - proof hd video camera			1
they baited the area with ‘ chum ’ - a mixture of fish heads and guts - to attract numerous blue and porbeagle sharks and whip them into a feeding frenzy			1
mr @entity16 said : ' we knew that nobody had climbed into the water to film sharks while baiting up in @entity4 waters before and wanted to be the first			1
fearless : mr @entity17 climbs into the cage with his water proof camera ramshackle : the cage , left , was mr @entity17 's only protection from dozens of sharks but it was enough to allow him to get = dramatic shots of sharks in @entity4 waters , right predator : more sharks are reportedly visiting @entity4 waters in search of food ' @entity17 and i are self - employed fishermen and we do n’t have much of a budget			1
' there was no way we could afford our own shark cage or hire one so we decided to improvise as best we could			0
' we picked up an old linen trolley from a scrapyard that is made of metal and weighs about 75lbs			0
' it only had three sides so we used some wire on the front up to waist height			0
that enabled @entity17 to lean out of the cage and fend off the sharks with the video camera			2
' we put three floats on top of it to give the cage buoyancy			0
' after baiting the water up , the two men were joined by half a dozen porbeagle and blue sharks that measured up to 8ft in length and weighed about 180lbs			0
mr @entity16 said : ' @entity160 are quite placid but some , like blue sharks , can be very aggressive and dangerous when there is blood in the water			2
' @entity17 climbed into the cage which then drifted about 20ft off the boat			0
' we whipped the sharks up into a feeding frenzy and @entity17 set about filming			1
' he got some great footage and some of the sharks got really close to him			0
one blue shark got too close and barged the front of cage			2
' i ’m quite certain that in that state , it would have had your arm if it tried			0
' we were delighted with the footage we got but we wo n’t be doing it again as we felt we had pushed our luck as far as we could			0
' footage : the unique footage has been added to an independent dvd about the underwater filming of fish in their natural environment jaws : some of the blue sharks were up to eight - feet long lucky : despite the success of the homemade trolley , pictured , the two fishermen say they will not try it again as they think they have used up all their luck			2

@entity16 and @entity17 wanted to be the first to capture sharks in feeding frenzy off @entity4 coast
spent just £ 5 on chicken wire as they tried to make recovered laundry trolley shark proof
mr @entity17 had run in with eight - foot blue shark that dented trolley
pair , from @entity52 , say they will not do it again as they ' pushed luck ' as far as they could
