it took just two days and a small collection of everyday household items for a group of @entity5 hackers to bypass the fingerprint sensor on an @entity7			1
@entity8 , based in @entity9 , took a high - resolution photograph of a fingerprint from the side of a glass			1
they then scanned it , before laser printing it onto a transparent sheet and covering it in woodglue			2
once the glue had dried , they peeled off the print copy and pressed it on the scanner			1
the image was inverted and laser printed onto a transparent sheet with a thick toner setting			1
hackers then poured woodglue onto the print pattern , pictured top			2
after it dried , the sheet was lifted and pressed onto the sensor , pictured bottom , to unlock the phone the fingerprint of the @entity7 owner was photographed from a glass surface , using 2400 dpi resolution			1
the image was cleaned up using photo - editing software , inverted and laser printed with 1200 dpi onto transparent sheet with a thick toner setting			1
hackers then poured pink latex milk or white woodglue into the print pattern created by the toner onto the transparent sheet			1
after it dried , the thin latex sheet is lifted from the sheet , breathed on ' to make it a tiny bit moist ' and pressed onto the sensor to unlock the phone			1
during the launch , @entity60 claimed the new @entity7 with a fingerprint sensor was ' much more secure than previous fingerprint technology			2
' hackers became so keen to prove the tech giant wrong that a security researcher called @entity67 even set up an online race to be the first to bypass the technology			0
he was offering £ 10,000 , alcohol and other prizes for anyone who could hack @entity60 's new range of security features			2
the @entity5 hacker , nicknamed @entity77 , said : ' in reality , @entity60 's sensor has just a higher resolution compared to the sensors so far			1
' so we only needed to ramp up the resolution of our fake ' ' as we have said now for more than years , fingerprints should not be used to secure anything			0
you leave them everywhere , and it is far too easy to make fake fingers out of lifted prints			0
' @entity8 first published the steps taken to bypass fingerprint scanners in 2004 and they claim that it uses everyday household items - meaning anyone can do it			1
the method involves the fingerprint of the @entity7 owner being photographed from a surface , such as a glass , using 2400 dpi resolution			2
the image is cleaned up using photo - editing software , inverted and laser printed with 1200 dpi onto transparent sheet with a thick toner setting			1
hackers then pour pink latex milk or white woodglue into the print pattern created by the toner onto the transparent sheet			2
after it dries , the thin latex sheet is lifted from the sheet , breathed on ' to make it a tiny bit moist ' and pressed onto the sensor to unlock the phone			1
during the launch , @entity60 claimed the new @entity7 with a fingerprint sensor , pictured , was ' much more secure than previous fingerprint technology			0
' hackers became so keen to prove the tech giant wrong that a security researcher set up an online £ 10,000 race to be the first to bypass the technology @entity60 's new software has been slammed for causing users to feel sick			0
features on software including zooming screens and app windows , full - screen slide transitions , a ' faux - @entity136 parallax effect ' on the home screen			0
as the phone is tilted , the icons appear to move independently from the wallpaper			0
stuff magazine investigated the effects these motion - based features had on users and discovered claims of nausea , motion sickness and even vertigo			0
@entity149 , spokesperson of the @entity8 said : ' we hope that this finally puts to rest the illusions people have about fingerprint biometrics			2
' it is plain stupid to use something that you can ´ t change and that you leave everywhere every day as a security token			0
the public should no longer be fooled by the biometrics industry with false security claims			0
biometrics is fundamentally a technology designed for oppression and control , not for securing everyday device access			0
' security expert @entity168 added : ' it ’s worth remembering that fingerprints are not secrets			0
you literally leave them lying around everywhere you go , and they could be picked up by @entity175 on your fingerprints to secure a device may be okay for casual security – but you should n’t depend upon it if you have sensitive data you wish to protect			0

@entity5 's @entity8 took a photo of a fingerprint on a glass
they inverted the high - resolution image and printed it on a *plastic* sheet
thin latex sheet was poured over the sheet and peeled off to create a print
@entity194 placed on a finger and pressed onto the scanner unlocks the device
