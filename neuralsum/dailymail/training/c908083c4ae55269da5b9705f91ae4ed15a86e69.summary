@entity1 police have apologised after assuming that a driver stopped on a rural @entity4 highway for driving with a kayak strapped sideways on its roof was an @entity8 tourist			1
@entity9 , inspector @entity10 , said that when the officer stopped the man on @entity15 to speak to him about the danger his kayak was posing to other road users , the man 's accent made her assume he was @entity8 , and so was not aware of the road laws in the country			1
the ' @entity8 ' driver was stopped by @entity22 for driving with his kayak lying sideways across his car 's roof ' unfortunately we did not check his identity documents and as a result the driver was issued a warning , ordered to remove the kayak and told to head back into town to get suitable transport arranged for the kayak before continuing his journey , ' inspector @entity10 said in a statement			1
' in this case the officer believed obtaining compliance from the motorist and preventing a crash was a more effective outcome than issuing the driver a fine and she believed she was enhancing foreign relations			0
' ' @entity22 wish to offer an unreserved apology to any persons of @entity8 descent we may have offended , ' said inspector @entity10			2
@entity1 is renowned for its beauty , not for spotting @entity8 accents mrs @entity10 said that regardless of the driver 's nationality , the main focus of the incident remained road safety and the risks posed by the driver to other road users should not be forgotten			0
' after all , over the next couple of weeks the population of the @entity4 is expected to rise from 15,000 to over 130,000			0
at any one time around 80 per cent of motorists on the region 's roads will be visitors of one sought or another and we will all need to drive safe to reach the beach this summer , ' she said .			0
