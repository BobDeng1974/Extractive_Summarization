by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 _ @entity3 's @entity2 may not be one of the famous managerial names in @entity7 football , but @entity8 says he ’s in the same bracket as @entity10 and @entity11			1
@entity8 signed a two - year deal at @entity3 this summer , having learnt his trade at @entity14			1
the @entity16 midfielder , who made just one senior appearance at the @entity18 , had first - hand experience of working with @entity10 and @entity11 but believes his new manager is best suited to his style of play			1
the @entity24 ' knees : @entity2 is highly rated by @entity3 's summer signing @entity8 ( below ) @entity8 said : ‘ i played with the first team at @entity14 during pre-season under both @entity10 and @entity11			1
‘ i was at @entity14 during @entity10 ’s first season and he had a very good relationship with the players			1
‘ i improved my football under him , mainly the defensive side of my game			2
‘ @entity11 was also a good manager and i think he wants to play more with the ball whereas @entity10 is more defensive			1
@entity16 flair : @entity8 came through the ranks at @entity14 and played for @entity36 in @entity37 last season ‘ but @entity2 is also very good			1
i like his style of play , it is good for me because it is the way i like to play football			2
i like to be in possession and pass the ball			0
‘ out of the three managers i would say @entity2 ’s style of football suits me the best , i feel comfortable with the way he plays the game			1
’ @entity8 was close to moving to @entity52 last season before making the switch to @entity36 in @entity37			1
but @entity2 finally got his man this summer when the 28 - year - old terminated his contract in @entity16			2
the midfielder is determined to make his name for himself in @entity7 and dreams of following other @entity16 by starring in the @entity60			2
the special one : @entity8 played under @entity62 chief @entity10 at the @entity18 he added : ‘ last year i was close to coming to @entity3 , but at the last moment i got an offer from @entity36 and i wanted to test myself in @entity37			1
‘ but i had another offer from @entity3 this summer and this time i came because i wanted to play in @entity7			1
‘ playing in @entity37 was a great experience for me			0
two of the best players in the world play there , @entity71 and @entity72 , and challenging them and trying to get the ball off them is very hard			0
‘ but i have signed a contract for two years with an option for a third at @entity3 , so i want to be an important player in this team and play here for a long time			1
’ trophy boy : @entity11 helped @entity82 to the @entity60 title last season @entity3 ’s return to the second tier of @entity7 football ended 21 years in the bottom two divisions			1
and @entity2 is not going into this season just to make up the numbers , with a new stadium on horizon , there is plenty of positivity around the west @entity96 club as they head into their season opener against capital rivals @entity99			0
the former @entity101 academy coach wants the @entity24 to follow the path set by @entity105 ’s @entity104 last season			2
tough test : @entity8 pitted his wits against the likes of @entity71 last campaign @entity2 said : ‘ our long - term aim is to fill the new stadium			2
that ’s what we use as our driving force in the dressing room – to fill a 20,000 - seater stadium			0
‘ how do we do that ? by playing the right type of football to get the fan base in , but we ’ve got to believe in what we do			0
‘ we ’ll set short - term targets , every five or seven games , but it ’s about us having the self - belief			0
‘ we ’ve got to look at positive examples , like @entity104 last year			0
great job : @entity2 wants @entity3 to follow the influence of @entity104 and @entity105 ‘ @entity105 did a magnificent job on one of the smallest budgets in the division			2
‘ it ’s not about budget all the time , it ’s about discipline , self - belief and @entity105 had that in abundance			0
we ’ve got to learn from that and try to replicate it here			0
‘ we ’re good friends and spoke a lot last year			0
he spoke of his budget being a survival one really , so it shows the quality of job he did			0
‘ that tells our players it ’s not about having people on 20 or 30 grand a week			0
it ’s about applying yourself and maximising what you have			0
’ if @entity2 does manage follow @entity104 into the @entity60 then there could be more people than just @entity8 comparing him to @entity10 and @entity11 .			1

@entity3 summer signing worked with @entity10 and @entity11 at @entity14
@entity8 came through the @entity18 ranks but played only once for first team
