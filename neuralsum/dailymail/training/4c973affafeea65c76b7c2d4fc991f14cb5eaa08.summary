by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 17:46 est , 14 august 2013 updated : 01:47 est , 15 august 2013 political parties faced demands to review all bequests last night after the @entity5 and @entity6 were shamed into handing back a spinster ’s £ 520,000 legacy			1
they gave up the cash after being accused of ‘ robbery ’ for pocketing the proceeds of 91 - year - old @entity14 ’s will , in a case highlighted yesterday by the @entity16			1
when she died last year , the former @entity18 nurse left her estate to ‘ whichever government is in office ’ to ‘ use as they may think fit ’			1
but instead of putting it into the @entity27 or improving schools , the @entity25 parties carved it up as a political donation			0
the @entity5 banked £ 420,000 and the @entity6 took £ 100,000			1
prime minister @entity31 ( left ) has given in to howls of protest and said the @entity5 would give up to the @entity34 their share of the money left by former @entity18 nurse @entity14 ( right ) party spin doctors had tried to suggest miss @entity14 had meant her legacy to benefit ‘ whichever party ’ was in power			1
but after the @entity16 revealed the true wording of the will , @entity31 gave in to the howls of protest and said the @entity5 would give up their share to the @entity34 , ‘ so it can help to pay down the national debt , which i think meets the spirit of what this very generous lady meant ’			1
it immediately prompted calls to examine other recent bequests to the main parties – there were 401 in the past decade			1
@entity55 , a @entity56 member of the public administration select committee , said the case cast a shadow of doubt over them			1
he added : ‘ all parties should go back through their bequests to check and ensure that there is no doubt at all over who was the intended beneficiary of the money			1
’ young donor : party spin doctors had tried to suggest @entity69 ( pictured in 1931 ) had meant her legacy to benefit ' whichever party ' was in power home : miss @entity14 had lived in the same three - bedroom semi-detached council house ( pictured ) since 1931 , when she moved in with her parents ‘ mps face a long battle to regain public trust after the expenses scandal , and this is not going to help			1
if doubts remain , then the stench will remain			0
’ @entity5 mp @entity82 said : ‘ i am sure all political parties will want to go back and check			1
in the light of the expenses scandal , politicians have to be so careful to be transparent about where their money came from			2
‘ this case has reinforced the public ’s impression about politics and politicians , which is n’t a good one			2
’ @entity93 , campaign director of the @entity94 ’ @entity95 , said : ‘ taxpayers who leave a little extra for public services when they are gone do n’t expect their cash to be diverted into politicians ’ election war chests			0
’ ' doubt ' : @entity56 mp @entity55 ( left ) said the case cast a shadow of doubt over the 401 bequests to the main parties made in the past decade			1
@entity5 mp @entity82 ( right ) said the case had ' reinforced the public 's impression about politics and politicians , which is n't a good one ' the @entity6 and @entity5 began the day yesterday clinging to the idea they would keep the cash , but they soon came under a barrage of criticism , including from their own mps			1
mr @entity82 said on @entity115 : ‘ whoever decided to accept a penny of @entity14 ’s money for the party has very poor judgment			1
we must return it before the morning is out			0
’ @entity123 , the @entity6 pensions minister , said miss @entity14 ’s wishes should be ‘ honoured ’ , while another @entity5 , @entity124 , said : ‘ this needs to be sorted out now			1
’ as the tide turned , the @entity6 rushed to be first to claim the moral high ground , announcing shortly before 11am they were paying their £ 100,000 share to the @entity34 to help pay off the national debt			1
within three minutes , the @entity5 hurriedly followed suit			2
the prime minister said : ‘ the executors of the will decided it was right to pay the money to the parties of government , the conservatives and the @entity6			1
‘ but i think when you look at the wording of the will , it seems to us the intention was more to benefit the nation			0
’ there was a twist in the afternoon when the executors of miss @entity14 ’s will , @entity150 solicitors , announced that she had verbally instructed them in 2001 she wanted her money ‘ to be left to whichever political party formed the government ’			1
but the firm could not explain why there was no mention of any party in the actual will that it had drafted for her			0
@entity162 ’s wills committee chairman @entity160 said it was ‘ regrettable ’ the firm ‘ did not actually interpret her instructions clearly ’ , and @entity164 , former chairman of the @entity165 , said there was no ambiguity ‘ whatsoever ’ in the wording of the will			0
her donation of £ 520,000 suggests that , before inheritance tax was taken off , miss @entity14 , of @entity172 , was worth £ 648,333 when she died			2
@entity174 said they had ‘ absolutely no idea ’ the former midwife had been so wealthy			0
about 20 mourners attended miss @entity14 ’s funeral in september 2012			2
retired vicar @entity181 @entity180 , 76 , read the following eulogy , which he yesterday gave to the @entity16			0
‘ she was someone who was fiercely independent and would only rarely accept help , even from people she knew well like close neighbours – and then only if it was “ absolutely necessary ”			0
‘ all her life she served others , firstly as a school nurse , then as a district nurse and finally , in her best remembered role , as a midwife			0
’ the vicar concluded : ‘ when she died , @entity14 was 91 years , one month and 12 days old			2
she served others all her life and they benefited from it			0
now she will receive her just reward			0
may she rest in peace			0
’ public - spirited @entity197 have left £ 7million to the nation over the past decade , but have bequeathed twice as much to political parties			1
the £ 23million total was bequeathed in 401 wills			2
there is usually no confusion about where the money should go , with wills explicitly spelling out who is to benefit – making it all the more extraordinary that @entity14 ’ legacy ended up in @entity5 and @entity6 coffers			1
since 2001 , political parties have been left almost £ 15.7million , according to figures from the @entity213			2
the @entity5 received the most – £ 5.6million – with @entity56 banking £ 3.9million			1
the @entity215 were next on £ 2.4million , followed by the @entity6 on £ 1.7million			2
analysis of a small sample of these wills reveals they were very specific in stating which party their money should go to			2
often , the person ’s will includes the address of the political party ’s headquarters , to rule out any doubt			2
for example , @entity227 of @entity228 , @entity229 , who died in january 2004 , left £ 396,409.55 to the @entity5			1
her will said the money should pass to ‘ the @entity234 of @entity235 of 32 @entity236 , @entity237 absolutely			0
’ similarly , @entity238 of @entity239 , @entity240 , who died in december 2000 , left £ 100,000 to the @entity56 , and her will states : ‘ as to a further quarter of my residuary estate for the @entity244 of 15 @entity245 , @entity237 , @entity246 for the general purposes of the @entity56			1
’ but @entity69 ’ money was handed to political parties when her will did not mention a particular party – and not even the word ‘ party ’			0
her case is not the first in which ambiguity has led to an unseemly scramble to grab a legacy			0
the @entity16 has learnt that in 2006 the death of @entity259 , a @entity260 gravedigger , led to a debate about his £ 1million assets , which he bequeathed to ‘ the government for the time being of the @entity197 ’			0
the term ‘ time being ’ caused difficulties because , when he prepared his will in the 1990s , @entity268 ’s @entity234 government was in power			0
when he died , in march 2006 , @entity56 was running the country			2
a former @entity5 adviser involved in the case , who did not want to be named , claimed that some politicians sought to ‘ snatch ’ the legacy			1
however , the adviser said @entity276 , now the attorney general but at the time a member of the @entity279 , took the view that the cash was clearly intended for the benefit of the nation			0
if people want to bequest money to the country , the usual procedure is that the executor of their will notifies the @entity291 ’s department , who are then prepared to receive a cheque made out to ‘ @entity34 ’			0
the £ 7million left to the nation came mainly from wills that typically stated that legacies should go to ‘ the government ’			2
over the past 12 years , other recipients of party donations have included @entity300 ( £ 531,000 ) , and the @entity301 ( £ 663,000 )			0
@entity302 of @entity303 , @entity304 , who died in april 2007 leaving £ 150,000 , was particularly specific in his instructions			0
he wrote that his money should go to the @entity307			0
the will went on to say that the sum should still go to the party even if it had changed its name or should go to any new party formed by its amalgamation			0
had the @entity307 ceased to exist , the will stated it should go instead to @entity315			0
bequests : according to figures from the @entity213 , political parties have been left almost £ 15.7m since 2001 , with @entity56 banking £ 3.9m and the @entity6 receiving £ 1.7m			1

@entity14 left her money to ' whichever government is in office '
the @entity5 and @entity6 were accused of ' robbery ' after pocketing money
they are now facing demands to review all bequests after handing it back
