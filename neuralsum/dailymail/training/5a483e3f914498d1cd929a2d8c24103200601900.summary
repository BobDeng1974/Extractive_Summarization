by @entity0 published : 04:35 est , 13 august 2012 updated : 04:57 est , 13 august 2012 according to new research , meerkats enhance their intelligence through nine different social and asocial mechanisms			2
the meerkat is an extremely social animal , living in tightknit colonies of between 20 and 30 individuals who make their homes in vast networks of tunnels			0
what really makes these animals stand out is their intelligent coordinated behaviour , which rivals that of chimps , baboons , dolphins and even humans in its complexity and efficiency			2
one of the terms given to a group of meerkats is a ' mob ' a team led by @entity28 of the @entity29 presented wild meerkats with a novel foraging task to investigate the animal 's learning mechanisms			1
they then applied a unique model to study how the meerkats went about the task			1
' the model deals with the rate at which individuals interact with the task , solve the task once they are interacting with it , or give up on the task when they are manipulating it , ' said @entity28			1
' it allows us to ask whether these things are affected by previous experience manipulating the task and observing others			0
' they found that the meerkats engaged in a wide variety of social and asocial behaviours to learn to solve the task , and that in general the social factors helped draw the meerkats into the task , while the asocial processes helped them actually solve the task			1
' meerkats that have solved the task in the past are more likely to interact with it , give up on it less quickly , and be quicker to solve the task once they have started interacting with it , ' said @entity28			1
' they also become faster at solving the task as they have unsuccessful attempts , suggesting they learn from their mistakes			2
' however , at the same time it appears that very successful meerkats give up on the task sooner , and very unsuccessful meerkats persist for longer , suggesting simply that meerkats try harder when they are hungrier , ' he continued			2
' we find that meerkats that see others solving the task interact with the task more , and persist for longer in trying to solve it : they seem to learn by observation that it is possible to get into the box to get the food			1
' based on these results , the team propose a new model for characterising social learning mechanisms in the field			0
the model may also be more broadly applicable and can be used to investigate the relationship between social learning mechanisms and so - called ' behavioural traditions ' that together can constitute a culture			0
' at the moment we plan to apply the methods to groups of monkeys and birds , but might try an experiment on human participants at some stage in the future , ' said @entity28			0
the full report is published in the open access journal @entity114			0
the small desert mammals are found in @entity116 , @entity117 , @entity118 and @entity119			0

@entity29 develop new model to analyse how meerkats learn
meerkats solve tasks with help of the mob but also a bit of *independent* thinking
model could be applied to other groups of animals
