@entity0 rammed some of the ridiculous criticism he has received in recent weeks from @entity4 supporters back down their throats with a first - half double and the perfect goal celebration			1
the former @entity7 forward , who scored 22 goals in 44 games in his first season at the club - including strikes that won the @entity14 and @entity16 final - has had to put up with whistles in his own stadium and a fan poll that had 40 per cent of supporters calling for him to be dropped in recent weeks			2
when he put @entity4 ahead on 18 minutes in the 2 - 0 win over @entity24 on sunday night he made sure he left off some steam , covering his ears as he ran to the corner to give the flag a celebratory kick			1
@entity0 celebrates , with obvious relief , after breaking a long scoring drought to put @entity4 ahead at the @entity32 the @entity34 winger covers both his ears to demonstrate that he has not been listening to the boos from the @entity4 fans @entity0 ran to the corner flag and kicked it as he let out some pent - up frustration having found the net for the first time since january @entity4 's two expensive superstars both celebrate after @entity0 had diverted @entity44 's shot into the corner of the net to make it 2 - 0 @entity4 ( 4 - 3 - 3 ) : @entity47 ; @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 ; @entity52 ( @entity53 78mins ) , @entity54 , @entity55 ( @entity56 69 ) ; @entity0 , @entity57 ( @entity58 82 ) , @entity44			1

goals : @entity0 18 , 40 booked : @entity52 @entity24 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity65 ; @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 ; @entity70 , @entity71 ; @entity72 ( @entity73 59 ) , @entity74 , @entity75 ( @entity76 59 ) ; @entity77 ( @entity78 75 )			1

it was his first goal in nine games but with 16 in 38 this season he remains on course to match last year 's haul and the singling out from those jeering supporters and some @entity4 - based media had clearly got to him			1
the only player who did not seem to share his joy was @entity44			0
it was his failed bicycle kick that was cleared off the line and came back out for @entity0 to volley into the top corner			0
@entity44 could be seen throwing his arms up in the air at his missed effort both before and after @entity0 had buried the rebound			2
it was hardly the action of a man playing solely for his team			0
the @entity103 scored again five minutes before the break , diverting a @entity44 shot past @entity65			1
@entity44 's effort looked as if it was going wide and although @entity0 's touch was slight it was necessary and he was awarded the goal			1
@entity0 's first half performance will have silenced those calls for him to be left out of the @entity4 team			1
the jeers that have followed him around the pitch in recent weeks could even be heard when his name was read out before this win - although those for rested goalkeeper @entity60 and coach @entity116 were more noticeable			0
@entity0 almost scored inside two minutes , taking a long ball forward down on his chest and volleying it across the face of goal			2
he looked motivated and buoyed by the return of @entity52 in midfield - making his first start for over three months			2
@entity0 has come in for plenty of criticism from the @entity126 crowd in recent weeks , but looked to have found his form at the right time @entity57 tracks @entity24 's @entity67 as @entity4 sought to respond after a poor performance against @entity130 @entity44 can not mask his frustration after striking the post with an early chance to put @entity4 ahead against @entity24 the @entity134 endured a difficult first half , with his temper bubbling below the surface despite @entity4 taking control it was a @entity52 shot that @entity65 pushed out to the edge of the six - yard box that @entity57 turned in moments later but all three @entity4 forwards - @entity0 , @entity57 and @entity44 - were offside			1
@entity52 then took a corner won by @entity0 and planted it on the @entity103 's head only for the effort to go just wide			1
@entity0 was everywhere in the first 45 minutes , even popping up on the left and drilling the perfect cross to the edge of the six - yard box where @entity44 somehow managed to fail to get enough on the centre and sent it wide			2
@entity4 had former @entity24 keeper @entity47 playing against his old team			0
@entity60 will return for next week 's visit to the @entity153			0
the stand - in keeper was a spectator for the most part as @entity4 dominated and @entity57 could have made it three in spectacular fashion after the break			0
he flicked the ball onto the crossbar with a volley from a @entity44 cross from the right and then caught the rebound again on the volley only to send it tamely wide			0
@entity44 also shot straight at @entity65 five minutes from time and skied an effort from the edge of the six - yard box in injury time			1
it was n't his night but it had been @entity4 's			2
they moved to within a point of @entity173 with the victory			0
it brings to an end a run of two defeats and a draw and sets them , and @entity0 , up perfectly for next week 's potentially season - deciding @entity181			0
@entity182 was more motivated - @entity116 @entity44 nicks the ball past @entity24 's @entity66 as @entity4 prepared for next weekend 's @entity181 with a win this acrobatic @entity44 volley was headed off the line , before @entity0 volleyed in the rebound to give @entity4 the lead @entity44 and @entity0 embrace after the second goal , but the @entity192 forward 's immediate reaction has been criticised @entity55 takes on @entity71 down the left hand side while @entity57 waits for the @entity194 to deliver a cross at the @entity32 on sunday night @entity24 goalkeeper @entity65 gets up ahead of @entity0 to claim a cross , but the keeper could do nothing about the @entity103 's goals @entity48 holds off the challenge of @entity77 on what proved to be a comfortable night for the home side in @entity126 @entity44 sees a shot saved by @entity65 on a night where he looked desperate to score , but found his way constantly blocked			1

@entity0 scored for the first time in 10 games to put @entity4 ahead after 18 minutes
@entity0 then deflected a @entity44 shot into the corner of the net for his second before half time
@entity44 appeared not to celebrate after his team - mate 's goal on a frustrating night for the @entity217 winner
@entity52 made his first start for @entity4 since *november* after injury
