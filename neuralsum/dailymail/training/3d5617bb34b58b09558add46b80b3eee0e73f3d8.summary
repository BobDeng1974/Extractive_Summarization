a mental health trust where patients have been punished with a dangerous form of restraint faces being put into special measures			1
inspectors found serious problems at the body that oversees mental health services in @entity9 and @entity10			2
these included patients being held in the face - down prone position and being put in seclusion as a punishment			1
the prone position involves two or more staff holding a patient face - down on the floor and pinning down their arms , legs and torso			1
it can result in compression of the chest and airways and can be fatal			0
the @entity27 - which is run by @entity9 and @entity28 - was singled out for its use of the ' prone ' position in a report which found the trust ' inadequate ' overall last april , @entity34 care minister @entity33 announced controls banning its deliberate use on patients			1
the @entity9 and @entity40 ’s secure unit had been told to review its procedures after 38 - year - old patient @entity42 died while being held in the prone position for almost 25 minutes in october 1998			1
a 2003 inquiry into the incident led by sir @entity45 found prone position restraints were ‘ always dangerous ’ and should never be used for more than three minutes			1
but a damning report into the trust released yesterday by the @entity50 revealed prone restraints were not only still being carried out at the trust ’s secure unit , they were being used as punishments			1
the report said : ‘ some patients told us that restraint and seclusion were used too frequently at the @entity27			1
‘ we were concerned about the high levels of face down ( prone ) restraint and that there was a punitive attitude towards patients			2
we observed that some episodes of restraint and seclusion may have been punitive			0
‘ while on the unit we saw that people who became violent were restrained and removed to the seclusion ward			0
five people told us that they had been restrained and secluded following refusal to follow staff instructions			0
one person told us that if you do not sit correctly on the chairs you could end up being restrained and secluded			0
’ the @entity9 and @entity40 ’s secure unit was told to review its procedures after 38 - year - old patient @entity42 died while being held in the prone position for almost 25 minutes in october 1998 in its report , the @entity50 said it was unacceptable that patients who were secluded did not always have access to toilets and had to use a urine bottle or bedpan			1
inspectors expressed concern that ‘ high numbers ’ of prone restraints being used at the trust ’s acute and psychiatric intensive care wards , as well as its two centres for adults with learning difficulties			2
nearly a third of all incidents where patients were restrained involved prone positions			0
the report stated : ‘ we found there was not a safe , effective or responsive service at this trust and the board needs to take urgent action to address areas of inadequacy			2
’ it revealed there was a widespread problem with staffing shortages and a lack of training			0
the @entity50 suggested the trust ’s problems were the fault of senior management , saying there was ‘ a lack of leadership , support and awareness ’ in some areas			2
but it praised frontline staff for being ‘ kind and caring ’ and rated the trust as ‘ good ’ in the care category			0
it was rated ‘ inadequate ’ overall however and the @entity50 has recommended to health services regulator monitor that it go into special measures			1
in a statement , the trust said it accepted the findings and ‘ vowed to put patients and staff first ’ under a management team which had seen ‘ extensive changes ’			0
deputy director of nursing @entity137 said the trust was implementing @entity141 guidelines on restraint			0
she added : ‘ the @entity27 is a secure unit that looks after mentally disordered violent offenders deemed to pose a risk of serious harm to the public			0
‘ the guidelines are clear that there must be no planned restraint of a person in a prone position and we are reviewing and improving all of our training to help staff make better use of positive behavioural support , de-escalation and prevention strategies			1
‘ restraint of a patient is only used as an absolute last resort where all other interventions have been exhausted			0

@entity9 and @entity28 rated ' inadequate ' by *watchdog*
@entity50 found a host of failings during october visit
these included the overuse of the ' prone ' position to restrain patients
the trust was told to review its use after death of @entity42 in 1998
@entity42 , 38 , died after being held in position for almost 25 minutes
report also reveals some patients in seclusion had no access to toilets
