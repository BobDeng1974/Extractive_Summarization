researchers have revealed a 16 - foot , 900 - pound ancient species of crocodile that battle with 58 foot long snakes that swam in the same rivers as @entity5 60 million years ago in the world ’s oldest - known rain forest			1
the terrifying reptile , which has an unusually blunt snout , had an incredibly strong bite , the researchers say			1
the claim the discovery sheds new light on the diversity of early rainforests , and how adaptable crocodiles are			2
the new species of crocodilian , illustrated here being constricted by			1
called @entity19 , after a ferocious fictional creature ( the ' balrog ' ) that appeared in @entity23 's novel ' @entity24 '			1
scientists assigned the species ’ name , @entity19 , in a study appearing online today in the journal @entity30			1
unearthed from the same layer of rock as @entity5 in the @entity35 coal mine of northern @entity36 , the species is named for a ferocious fictional creature ( the @entity38 ) that appeared in @entity23 ’s novel ' @entity24 ' and dwelled deep in the @entity40 ' @entity39			1
' the new species in the dyrosaurids family , lived alongside the 58 - foot @entity5 as portrayed in the @entity44 documentary on the ' monster snake			1

' the new species opens a window to the early adaptability and diversity of tropical crocodyliforms , which may help scientists better understand how living crocodiles adapt to changing environments today , said lead author @entity60 , a postdoctoral researcher at @entity61 and former graduate student at the @entity63 and @entity65 ’s department of geological sciences			1
' it quickly became clear that the four fossil specimens were unlike any dyrosaur species ever found , ' @entity60 said			1
' everyone thinks that crocodiles are living fossils that have remained virtually unchanged for the last 250 million years			2
' but what we ’re finding in the fossil record tells a very different story			2
' @entity77 , co-author and @entity79 associate curator of vertebrate paleontology , said researchers were stunned when they first saw the new species			2
' we could n’t believe it had such a boxy , short skull and that it was still a dyrosaur , ' @entity77 said			2
' it really busts the mold for these animals			0
' it is such a completely different looking beast than we ’ve seen for these crocodile - like animals			0
' the animal is the third new species of ancient crocodilian pulled from @entity35 , one of the world ’s largest open - pit coal mines			1
titanoboa cerrejonensis measured 48 feet and weighed as much as a car			0
the monster relative of the boa constrictor lived in northern @entity36 60 million years ago originating in @entity101 , the dyrosaurids swam across the @entity102 to @entity103 about 75 million year ago			0
the family somehow survived the extinction event that wiped out the dinosaurs and persisted to become a top predator , @entity60 said			0
' this group offers clues as to how animals survive extinctions and other catastrophes , ' @entity60 said			0
' as we face climates that are warmer today , it is important to understand how animals responded in the past			0
' this family of crocodyliforms in @entity35 adapted and did very well despite incredible obstacles , which could speak to the ability of living crocodiles to adapt and overcome			0
' the crocodyliforms that lived in the @entity35 ecosystem during the @entity124 , when temperatures were higher than today , thrived and grew to enormous sizes , @entity77 said			0
dyrosaurids were commonly ocean - dwellers , but the new species lived in freshwater rivers , ate turtles and fish and would have lived in close proximity to @entity5			2
however , the giant snake would have been a formidable threat to @entity137 with the tremendous grip of its constricting coils , he said			0
' every once in a while , there was likely an encounter between @entity19 and @entity5 , ” ' @entity77 said			0
' @entity5 was the largest predator around and would have tried to eat anything it could get its mouth on			0
