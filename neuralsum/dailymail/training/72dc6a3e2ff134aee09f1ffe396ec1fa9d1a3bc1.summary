if you want to brush up on the @entity2 while you 're on the go , one company has developed a novel solution that fits in your pocket - and on your fingernail too			1
the @entity8 company has developed a tiny version of part of the sacred texts , which can be worn around the neck or even embedded inside a watch			2
measuring less than 0.2 inches ( 5mm ) across , the company is seeking validation from the @entity16 that it is indeed the world 's smallest @entity18 - although you 'll need a microscope to read it			1
here it is shown on display at @entity24 in @entity25 in northern @entity26			0
the nano - sized @entity2 has been nominated for the @entity16 as the @entity27 's @entity18 on just one face of the square chip , 27 books of the @entity2 have been printed			1
the tiny biblical text uses the @entity33 version of the @entity2 , @entity34 , or ' received text ' in @entity36			0
each chip is made from a silicon wafer , with their sides measuring a minuscule 0.19 inches ( 4.76mm )			1
on the chips , each letter has a width of about 0.18 microns ( 18 millionths of a metre ) , so an eight - inch ( 20.3cm ) wafer can apparently contain more than 1,000 bibles			2
an academic scholar validated , with the use of a microscope , that the text was indeed that of the @entity2			2
on the chips , each letter ( shown ) has a width of about 0.18 microns ( 18 millionths of a metre ) , so an eight - inch ( 20.3cm ) wafer can apparently contain more than 1,000 bibles @entity57 , currently the world 's smallest book , is a reproduction of a 30 - page tale that fits on a human hair			1
the book , which is printed with pure crystalline silicon , cost a staggering $ 15,000 ( around Â£ 9,250 ) to create			0
it was written by @entity64 and published by his brother , @entity65 , at the @entity66 , in @entity67 , @entity68			0
the book 's exact measurements are 70 micrometres by 100 micrometres			0
its pages , which are too small to be read even using a microscope , are printed on a single tablet			0
the @entity8 company is now awaiting validation from @entity16 of their claim for the world 's smallest bible			1
the previous record holder , which came into the possession of an @entity83 scholar , measures 1.1 x 1.3 x 0.39 inches ( 2.8 x 3.4 x 1.0 cm )			0
' our aim is to be able to mass produce it and cater to really every pocket , ' said @entity89 , head of the company 's marketing and sales department			0
' because this application , the smallest @entity18 in the world , @entity8 , can be applied to infinite possibilities in the jewellery industry			1
' in the future the company is also planning to produce a nano - sized @entity99			0
the company says the tiny bible can be used in jewellery ( necklace shown ) , embedded in watches or any number of other ' infinite possiblites ' each chip is made from a silicon wafer , with their sides measuring a miniscule 4.76mm			1
an academic scholar validated , with the use of a microscope , that the text ( shown ) was indeed that of the @entity2			2

the @entity8 company says they 've made the smallest @entity18
it measures just 4.76mm on each side and could fit on your fingernail
each silicon wafer chip contains all 27 books of the @entity2
the letters are each 18 millionths of a metre wide and can only be read with a microscope
the company is now seeking validation from @entity16
