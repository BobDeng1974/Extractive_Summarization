@entity0 is working on improving his single - mindedness as he bids to improve his chances of winning this year 's formula one world title			1
@entity0 , who topped the timesheet following friday practice ahead of sunday 's @entity6 , has shown himself to be a more resilient character throughout the course of this season compared to years gone by			1
the technical problems with @entity12 's @entity11 , which have put him on the back foot for the majority of this campaign , may have impacted more significantly on him in previous years			1
@entity0 is working on improving his single - mindedness as he bids to win this year 's world title however , older , wiser and more experienced , he has instead responded by taking the necessary steps to ensure his sole focus is on beating team - mate @entity20 to the championship			1
when it was suggested to @entity0 that he is allowing nothing to get in his way this season , he replied : ' i am working on that because that has been my @entity29 in the past			1
' it is something you can not force			2
it comes with time , but it is something i 've been working on for a long time			2
' i am nearly 30 , so bit by bit with those experiences i have had , they have helped massively			2
' this year , with all the difficult scenarios i have had , what really encourages me is how i have come through them			2
' take the last race in @entity43			0
although i won from pole , i dropped to fourth at the start			0
' to come back and fight through such a difficulty is so much more satisfying and more powerful			0
' whilst people enjoyed watching it , i get so much more from it , so those experiences have really helped me a lot			0
' @entity0 , who has previously allowed off - track woes to affect him , is benefiting from a more settled personal life			1
the 29 - year - old 's romance with on - off - on - again girlfriend @entity55 is going through a solid phase , as is his relationship with father @entity58 - who cheered on his son again at the @entity60 with @entity0 's step - mother @entity61			1
@entity62 pips @entity20 to pole @entity20 still leads the drivers ' championship but has seen his lead cut to 22 points recently after watching him win in @entity43 to close the gap to @entity20 to 22 points in the standings , it is the first time @entity12 senior has attended races back to back for some considerable time			1
' being settled personally is always a huge part of it , ' remarked @entity0 junior			1
' i am getting older and managing things better , and although things can always be better and you can always try to improve , at the moment things are quite calm			0
' the water is really calm on my side			0
it makes things a little bit easier			0
' much will depend on the reliability of his car , which has so far cost him countless points - and almost certainly the championship lead			2
however , the title chaser pointed out : ' when i have made mistakes i 've always recovered			0
' even when the car has had a problem , which has been the majority of the time , i have generally recovered from it			0
' i feel like i have come back and maximised every race given the scenarios i 've had to handle			0
' i 've no idea what lies ahead of me , but i am better prepared than ever in terms of having the experiences , and where i am , to handle what is to come			0
' @entity0 pointed out that when he 's recovered when mistakes have been made in the past on track , under the bright @entity106 lights , @entity0 produced a solid start to the weekend by leading the way in practice , finishing 0.133 seconds clear of @entity112 's @entity111			1
@entity20 , meanwhile , was down in 13th as his low - fuel qualifying run on the fast supersoft tyres was thwarted by @entity115 hitting a wall in his @entity117 , bringing out the red flags			1
@entity120 's @entity119 was third , three tenths of a second down on @entity12 , followed by @entity122 in his @entity112			0
@entity123 , four - times champion and winner of this event for the last three years , was a remarkable fifth - 0.551secs behind @entity0 in his @entity120			1
at the end of @entity129 's car suffered an engine issue which resulted in his mechanics spending all their lunch break and the majority of @entity134 working to replace the system			0
with 10 minutes remaining @entity129 finally made it out on track on a set of supersoft tyres to push himself up the order			2
@entity141 was seventh in his @entity142 , with @entity144 's @entity143 20th and four seconds down , but with his @entity134 cut short by a turbo problem that forced him to pull off track .			2
