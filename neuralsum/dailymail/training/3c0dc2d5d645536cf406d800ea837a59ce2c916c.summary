recognition : the @entity0 for the first time has officially recognized transgender veterans including @entity3 , pictured the @entity0 for the first time has officially recognized transgender service members in a significant step being hailed by the @entity7 community			1
the acknowledgement came in the form of a letter to veteran and transgender activist @entity3 confirming that the @entity12 had updated its records to show she is a woman			1
while still a long way from open transgender service in the military , @entity19 , an organization for gay , lesbian , bisexual and transgender service members and their families labeled the move ' symbolic			1
' the letter from the @entity12 official , dated may 2 , read : ' per your request the @entity27 ( @entity27 ) has been updated to show your gender as female effective april 12 , 2013			1
' @entity3 's military identification card now reflects the change			2
' the fact that a process exists [ to change the gender listed ] indicates that there are people in the @entity0 who are aware of the needs of transgender retirees and who are working to see those needs met , ' @entity19 executive director @entity33 told @entity43			0
' and , in that sense , the significance of this symbolic act for our broader work and for our goal of open service becomes i think a little bit more apparent			0
' previous life : @entity3 , pictured here as a man in 1980 , says here military identification card now reflects the change gay , lesbian and bisexual service members have been able to serve openly in the military since september 2011 , however if transgender people try to do the same they continue to be discharged , according to @entity43			1
@entity3 said she went to the @entity0 to change her gender status after successfully changing to a woman in records in @entity65 , the @entity66 , the state department and the social security office			2
' i had heard that it could be done ; i had never heard of anybody actually doing it , ' @entity3 said			0
so she submitted all the documentation and in may was thrilled to hear the change had been made , marking a step , she believes , towards open service for transgender people			1
symbolic : @entity3 , pictured holding a photo of herself , submitted all the documentation and in may was thrilled to hear the change had been made , marking a step , she believes , towards open service for transgender people unfair : gay , lesbian and bisexual service members have been able to serve openly in the military since september 2011 but not transgender people like @entity3 , pictured left today and right in 1980 as a man ' by showing you can actually change your gender marker with the @entity0 ... then it 's another step toward figuring out a way to have open service for trans people , ' she said			1
' that 's my end and i think this is going to be a step to get there			0
' @entity99 said it was the first time in the organization 's knowledge that the @entity0 has recognized and changed the gender of anyone affiliated , in a uniformed capacity , to the military			0
' that alone makes it very significant , not just for this veteran herself , but for likely thousands of others who can have these corrections made to their @entity27 documents , ' @entity99 said			0
but she called for the @entity0 to agree to gender changes on historical documents including the @entity118 from @entity119			0
' i would say that it is a very early and very small step in a long process to achieve our goals here , ' @entity99 told @entity43			0
' but , it is significant , as the earliest steps always are , because it reflects a shift , even if it is a small one , in the way that transgender people are viewed within the institution of the @entity134 military			2

the acknowledgement came in the form of a letter to veteran and transgender activist @entity3 confirming that the @entity12 had updated its records to show she is a woman
*advocates* claim the move is a ' symbolic ' step in the fight for transgender people to be allowed to serve openly in the military
gay , lesbian and bisexual people have been able to serve openly in the military since september 2011 but transgender people will be discharged
