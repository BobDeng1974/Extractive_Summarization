it has long been thought that @entity2 man abandoned their dead with little thought or respect			2
but the discovery of cremated bone , thought to be the earliest ever identified in @entity8 , could re-write the history of @entity10 , or @entity11 burial practices			1
the deposit containing the bone was discovered during excavations ahead of a new pipeline in @entity17 , @entity18 and is thought to date to 5,600 bc. the discovery of cremated bone ( pictured ) , thought to be the earliest ever identified in @entity8 , could re-write the history of @entity10 , or @entity11 burial practices the burnt material , which includes approximately just over four ounces ( 118g ) of cremated bone , was uncovered by @entity20			1
it was placed into a pit with a diameter of about three feet ( one metre ) and then backfilled with soil			0
three radiocarbon dates , two from bone fragments and one from charcoal , have confirmed the remains are around 7,614 years old and fall within the the @entity30 , between 6,000 @entity31 and 4,000 bc. @entity36 , who lead the excavation , said ‘ we were expecting this cremation to date to the @entity39 - we were so surprised when the first radiocarbon date came back as @entity34 that we did two more to double - check			1

this image is a still from a tv show called meet the ancestors showing what a @entity47 hut may have looked like the find is significant because it sheds light on early human society in @entity8 , when people were largely nomadic hunter gatherers before the arrival of farming			2

time and resources were invested in funerary practices despite a mobile hand - to - mouth existence , the experts explained			0
dr @entity77 , head of burials at @entity20 , analysed the bone to find that it represents the remains of at least one adult , despite the total weight being around seven per cent of what would be expected from a complete individual			0
taken alongside evidence of a large amount of charcoal in the pit , it ’s thought the material represents a deposit of some of the remains from a pyre , and not all of the cremated bone from it			1

before the discovery , just 20 examples of human bone dating from the @entity47 , which spans from 10,000 to @entity129 , were found – and none of them had been cremated			2
but a group of three cremations from the period have been found in @entity136 , so the ‘ new ’ site seems to fit into a wider @entity139 pattern of behaviour			0
three @entity10 flints were also discivered in the pit and while none are finished tools , they are sharp enough to have been used for cutting			0
more flints were found nearby , as well as a @entity39 barrow , early @entity149 site , @entity151 settlement and a medieval building all where the @entity18 and @entity154 pipeline is planned			0

bone from more than one human dates to the @entity10 in 5,600 @entity31
it was recovered from a pit with charcoal remains , in @entity17 , @entity18
evidence suggests ancient people respected and cremated their dead
