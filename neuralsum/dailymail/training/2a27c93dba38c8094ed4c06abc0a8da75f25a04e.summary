the preacher , who suffered a stroke three weeks after the may prediction failed , said the light dawned on him that instead of the biblical rapture in which the faithful would be swept up to the heavens , the date had instead been a " spiritual " @entity31 , which placed the entire world under @entity44 's judgment			0
