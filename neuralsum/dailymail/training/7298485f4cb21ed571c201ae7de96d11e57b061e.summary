@entity25 then turned to one sergeant at the scene and said : ' @entity30 , if you rat me out ... ' @entity16 said			1

@entity25 said , ' sir , yes , sir , ' when asked if he understood them			1
@entity16 said @entity25 seemed utterly normal in the hours before the march 11 killings			1
with his colleagues , @entity25 watched the movie ' @entity72 , ' a fictional account of a former @entity75 operative on a revenge rampage			1
just before he left the base , @entity16 said , @entity25 told a @entity79 soldier that he was unhappy with his family life , and that the troops should have been quicker to retaliate for a roadside bomb attack that claimed one soldier 's leg			1
' at all times he had a clear understanding of what he was doing and what he had done , ' said @entity16 , who described @entity25 as lucid , coherent and responsive			1
@entity25 is accused of slipping away from the remote outpost with an m - 4 rifle outfitted with a grenade launcher to attack the villages of @entity94 and @entity95 , in a dangerous district			1
@entity19 officials have said they believe @entity25 broke the slaughter into two episodes - walking first to one village , returning to the base and slipping away again to carry out the second attack			2
the prosecutor said @entity25 returned to the base at one point , telling a colleague about shooting people at a village			1

@entity16 said @entity25 was the caped figure			2
after being taken into custody , @entity16 said , @entity25 said : ' i thought i was doing the right thing			2

@entity25 ' attorney , @entity142 , said the hearing will give the defense a chance to see what the government can prove			1
they are expecting a court martial			1
@entity25 is an @entity150 native who joined the @entity151 in late 2001 - after the 9/11 attacks - as his career as a stockbroker imploded			2
an arbitrator entered a $ 1.5 million fraud judgment against him and his former company that went unpaid , and his attempt to start an investment firm in @entity161 also failed			0
he was serving his fourth combat tour after three stints in @entity43 , and his arrest prompted a national discussion about the stresses posed by multiple deployments			2
@entity62 , his attorney , declined to say to what extent the lawyers hope to elicit testimony that could be used to support a mental - health defense			0
@entity25 himself will not make any statements because his lawyers said he would have nothing to gain			2
bodies of @entity7 civilians , allegedly shot by @entity19 soldier staff sergeant @entity17 , loaded into the back of a van in @entity95 village of @entity182 district , @entity184 province @entity72 : the movie @entity25 watched with colleagues before allegedly carrying out 16 counts of premeditated murder and six counts of attempted murder @entity25 ' wife , @entity191 , who plans to attend the hearing , had complained about financial problems on her blog in the year before the killings , and noted @entity25 was disappointed at being passed over for a promotion			1
@entity197 described those stresses as garden - variety - nothing that would prompt such a massacre - and has also said , without elaborating , that @entity25 suffered a traumatic incident during his second @entity43 tour that triggered ' tremendous depression			1
' @entity25 remembers little or nothing from the time of the attacks , the defense said			1
@entity62 , who deferred an opportunity to give an opening statement , said the @entity151 had only recently turned over a preliminary dna trace evidence report from the crime scenes , but defense experts have not had time to review it			0
@entity25 , who spent months in confinement at @entity216 , @entity217 , before being transferred to @entity23 last month , is doing well , @entity62 said			2
@entity25 maintains that her husband is innocent and was not responsible for the senseless slayings			1
speaking to @entity120 on sunday , she said she finds it ' incomprehensible ' that her husband and best friend , ' @entity220 , ' faces 16 charges of premeditated murder			2
' it does n't seem possible			0
especially that there were women and children , ' she said			0
' my heart goes out to those families that lost loved ones , parents and grandparents			0
i am a mom ; i ca n't imagine losing my child , especially to something like that			0
' ms @entity25 said she learned of the attack within hours from military officials and her initial reaction was that ' it must have been a mistake			2
' ' it certainly was n't , it was n't my husband , ' she said			0
' i know my husband			0
i know him very well , and especially the talk about the women and the children			0
i knew that it was n't my husband			0
so it was just incomprehensible to me			0
' speaking to her husband in the middle of that march night confirmed to her that even he did n't know what really happened			0
changing tales : @entity25 ' lawyer says the army should take greater responsibility for sending soldiers into combat who are suffering from ptsd and head injuries , but now he seems grateful for the plea deal @entity264 will not make any statements in court because his lawyers said he would have nothing to gain ' he was like , ' what ? what you talking about ? ' he had , he knew that something was going on , but did not know the extent of what was going on , and i was actually the one that had told him how many people had died , and that included women and children , and he was blown away			1
he did not know the details as they had been portrayed in the press			0
' but @entity191 told @entity120 she believes the truth has yet to come out			1
' i do n't think we have even begun to have the truth			0
' in the meantime , ms @entity25 said she finds it hard explaining to the couples ' two - year - old son and five - year - old daughter why their father is sitting in a jail cell			2
' it 's been difficult , ' she said			0
' i question myself , what is the right thing to say , what is the right thing to explain to them , what can they understand ? and for me , i do n't even really understand what is happening , so how can i possibly expect my kids to understand , right ? ' media coverage : television trucks parked near the military courtroom where @entity17 ' preliminary hearing is taking place but the family regularly travels the mere mile to where @entity264 ' has been calling home			2
their conversations are monitored but at least , she says , they can be a family			0
' we are together , we 're as a family			0
we 're regular ; we can look forward to it			0
we know when we are going to see him again			0
it 's somewhat normal , ' she said			0
to help pay what could end up being millions of dollars in legal fees , ms @entity25 has set up a website , @entity324 , where people can donate to the @entity326			1
' really the reason we need a defense fund is to get a fair trial out of this			0
i really feel @entity220 gave his best for his country			0
now it is time for @entity19 to give their best to him			0
' she told the tv station that she tries not to dwell on the possibility that her husband may spend his life behind bars or worse , face the death penalty			2
' i have come to terms with that , and that i have put away			0
you know , i thought about it and i put it away until i actually have to deal with it			0
so you , i have learned to compartmentalize a lot of these issues , too			0
yes , i 've thought about it and yes , that scares me			0
