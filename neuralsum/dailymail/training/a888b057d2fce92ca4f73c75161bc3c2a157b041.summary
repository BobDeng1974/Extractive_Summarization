by @entity0 follow @ @ laura_mail imagine turning up for a five - day survival course in the @entity2 and finding a man known as ‘ @entity4 ’ staring back at you			1
@entity6 can just about see the funny side of his outward bound experience last october , just one part of a diverse football sabbatical that has taken the former @entity12 under 21 manager from @entity13 to the @entity14			1
he will return to the game full - time on july 1 , as the manager of @entity17 , and looks considerably refreshed and energised , even after a morning coaching children at a school near @entity20 in east @entity21			1
ready : @entity6 can not wait to take over as manager at @entity17 direction : @entity6 ( left ) managed @entity24 and was a coach with the @entity12 senior side too ‘ we just pitched up for five days in the wilds of @entity29 last october with two ex-marines , ’ says @entity6			1
‘ it was brilliant , absolutely brilliant			0
we learned survival skills , shelter - building , skinning hares			2
‘ to be fair the other people came from such diverse parts of the world that only two knew ( of me )			0
there was a fella from @entity42 , one from @entity43 , myself , an ex-marine from @entity45 , a policewoman from @entity47 and a @entity49 fella from the tourism industry			0
‘ within a day we were in a shelter we had built ourselves in a wood glade with a camp fire chopping up bits of rabbit to cook for dinner that night			0
’ @entity6 had booked the course the previous january , knowing his six years as @entity12 under 21 manager would come to an end after the @entity62 that summer			1
but any suggestion his time in the wild taught him anything about himself is firmly , if politely , dismissed			0
there has been no great spiritual awakening over the past year for this straight - forward former left back , only an opportunity to indulge his love of traveling , theatre and live gigs			0
selection : if @entity74 is out of form and unfit then @entity6 does not think he should be selected dropped : @entity6 says he would not have played @entity74 at the @entity76 as he was out of form ‘ did i learn anything about myself ? not really , ’ he says			1
‘ you ’re permanently hungry on a survival course and you prioritise keeping warm and eating			2
’ it is the same no - nonsense approach that has characterised @entity6 as a player , coach and manager			1
he has already told his @entity17 staff to forget the ‘ sleeping giant ’ tag that suggests the club has some @entity90 - given right to win promotion to the @entity92 owing to its illustrious past			1
‘ i hate it , ’ he says			0
the same approach underpins @entity6 ’s response to being asked if the debate about whether @entity74 should start for @entity12 is justified			1
‘ i think he should be treated as i always have done with every player in my care , ’ he says			0
‘ i went to the @entity103 tournament in 2011 , had to convince @entity104 to go , convince @entity105 to let me have @entity104 and then his form was n’t good enough so i left him out after the first game			1
@entity104 ’s in tears about it , but i ’ve got no duty to pick him when @entity111 ’s playing so well			0
youth : @entity6 hopes that @entity113 ( right ) plays the youngsters like @entity115 ( left ) progress : he thinks that players such as @entity118 will not learn from just being taken for the ' experience ' ‘ in 2010 @entity74 should have been left out of the team because his form was so poor , but @entity121 kept him in the team			1
even at club level , i ’ve always had a mentality of no matter who you are , you can go in and out of the team			2
‘ @entity131 was a great master for us			0
you knew straight away he would put you out of the team as an example to the rest of the group if your standards dropped			2
’ ‘ quarter - finals ’ is @entity6 ’s blunt assessment of @entity12 ’s chances in @entity140 , while the suggestion @entity113 ’s squad might get cabin fever , or struggle to be away from home , is also given short shrift			1
‘ every time i hear a player say “ we did n’t have this or that ” i ’m embarrassed for my profession , if i ’m being honest with you , ’ says @entity6 , capped 78 times by @entity12			1
‘ it just shows a total lack of imagination and @entity156 , probably			0
‘ you ’re there to do a job at , arguably , the greatest moment in your life			0
i was an international for 12 years and i played at one @entity162 ( in 1990 )			1
that shows you everyone should grasp it with both hands			0
’ raw : players such as @entity169 ( right ) need game time at the @entity162 or at youth level tournaments @entity6 ’s passion for wearing the @entity12 shirt has never been questioned , but his gripe is that young , exciting and talented players such as @entity118 and @entity169 have been promoted to the senior side before their time			1
it might seem a perverse approach from a former under 21 boss , but @entity6 ’s mantra has been consistent : @entity183 players should serve apprenticeships at @entity185 , under 19 and under 21 level in order to make the senior side more successful			1
he would therefore have picked @entity188 - ‘ the best left back @entity12 have ever had ’ - ahead of @entity118			0
he calls his six years with the @entity189 ‘ brilliant ’ but admits the ‘ politics ’ - those annual battles with @entity92 managers in a bid to select the best players - were ‘ a slight frustration ’			2
that feels like @entity6 is , for once , treading carefully , given the considered argument that follows			1
‘ if @entity118 comes back from this @entity162 having not kicked a ball i would have said it was a wasted adventure for him , ’ he says			2
‘ i think he would have been better going to the @entity200 ( with @entity12 ’s under 20 side ) and playing in the @entity203 qualifier			0
that ’s where we miss a trick time and time again			0
psycho : @entity6 was nicknamed ' psycho ' or his tough - tackling and no - nonsense approach seasoned pro : @entity6 was capped 78 times by his country and played at major tournaments ‘ i think we ’ve got a lot of players in the @entity12 squad who i ’m not sure will deliver - and that ’s for good and for bad			1
i ’ve just got my fingers crossed they play minutes			2
‘ too many of our young players keep missing tournaments			1
it ’s a sad thing			0
it ’s not a duty of care to our best players who , in the thin pool that we have , have to play 90 minutes in every international get - together			2
‘ their clubs give them a ready - made excuse to get out of the younger age groups , saying they ’ve grown out of it ; the agents do n’t want their players playing and then there ’s the egos of the players themselves			2
they do n’t want it			0
‘ all we do is strip down bare our pool of talent , then leave them in the stand and not let them play football			2
we try to build the roof first and it wo n’t work			0
’ ‘ @entity4 ’ , after all , knows all about surviving in the wild these days			0
@entity6 was speaking on behalf of @entity251 , which run throughout the @entity252 and are designed to give children of all abilities the opportunity to enjoy being active			1

@entity6 dismisses the idea that @entity17 are ' sleeping giants '
he believes that @entity74 should be dropped if his form is poor
he says players should only be taken to the @entity162 if they will play
young players should go to youth level and @entity103 tournaments to develop
