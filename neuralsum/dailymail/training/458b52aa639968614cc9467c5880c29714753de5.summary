by @entity0 published : 17:45 est , 28 november 2013 @entity2 : 05:46 est , 29 november 2013 anarchy , acts of terror , crimes against the public			2
to combat it , i ’ve got special men : experts from the @entity10 , the police , from every service — these are @entity12 ! ’ that rousing mission statement , overlaid with the throb of wah - wah guitars and screaming engines , heralded the controversial @entity18 action series that was a grittier , tougher answer to @entity20 cop duo shows like @entity21			1
@entity22 and @entity23 were @entity12 — anti-terrorist agents licensed to use ‘ any means necessary ’			1
they did their own stunts , too			2
@entity23 ( @entity36 ) was the sensitive one with a bubble - perm and a conscience			1
the real hardman of the show was saturnine @entity22 , the ex-mercenary played by @entity27 , who died in @entity42 on wednesday after a five - year battle with cancer			1
@entity22 and @entity23 were the paramilitary wing of @entity46 , a maverick unit called @entity12 run by @entity48 , played by war movie veteran @entity49			1
it was his @entity51 growl that warned of ‘ anarchy ’ and ‘ acts of terror ’ , and set the uncompromising tone for the show			2
for all their outrageous machismo , the friendship between @entity22 and @entity23 sometimes verged on camp — and if @entity27 had been more of a suave @entity60 figure , @entity12 could have looked as fake as @entity61 or other @entity20 ‘ action ’ imports			1
but his tough - guy persona was no act			1
@entity27 was super-fit , a part - time paratrooper from the docks of @entity67			1
after the show ended , he applied to join the @entity69 , and passed the initial selection stages for the territorial unit 23 @entity69 , before senior officers ruled that his celebrity status made him a security risk			1
family : the @entity18 actor with his wife @entity77 and their 19 - month old son @entity78 at their wedding ‘ i was just playing myself in @entity12 , ’ he admitted			1
‘ i was a sensitive , shy boy , but i went to a very hard school and you had to learn the ground rules			2
’ after he was clubbed to the ground in a street fight by a boy wielding a brick , @entity27 took up martial arts and became a judo brown belt			2
his father @entity91 was a shipwright and amateur musician , who played the piano in local clubs with a band called the @entity96			1
born in 1946 , @entity27 showed an early love for performing — at two , he won a contest as the @entity99 in @entity100			2
@entity91 bought him a drumkit for £ 25 and young @entity27 was soon playing with the swingers			2
but this was the era of @entity104 and @entity105 , and at 13 he joined a group of older lads to form @entity108			2
the ‘ beat ’ music scene in @entity100 was just beginning			2
‘ we were all in the same @entity111 can being shook up , and we knew this thing was going to explode ! ’ he said			2
the @entity108 did n’t make the grade , though , and in the early @entity114 decided to be a hairdresser instead			0
he started training at the @entity117 salon , and soon tasted success : teenage singing sensation @entity119 insisted that only he could do her beehive when she was in the city			0
his fellow apprentice , @entity122 , had an older brother called @entity124 who was in a local band			0
the two hairdressers used to try to write songs on piano and guitar at the @entity122 house , and one day in 1962 @entity122 urged his mate to audition as drummer for his brother and @entity134 , to replace @entity135			0
‘ are you mad ? ’ @entity27 retorted			0
‘ do n’t you realise , in two years i could be earning £ 42 a week ? ’ instead , he drifted from hairdressing into playing bass guitar for one - hit wonders the @entity139 , before taking a job as a lorry driver , delivering crisps and lemonade			1
one afternoon , sitting in a lorry cab with no heater and listening to a play on the radio , he decided to become an actor			1
deadly force : mr @entity27 ( right ) with his @entity12 co-star @entity36 ‘ when i told my mates back at the depot they all laughed , ’ he admitted , ‘ it was like saying i wanted to be an astronaut			0
’ within a year he was at @entity155 , a drama school in @entity157 , @entity158 , where fellow student @entity159 remembers his sheer physical presence			0
playing @entity161 in a fight scene one day , @entity27 bolted from the building , apparently stricken with stage fright — and then came racing back , panting and sweating as though he really had just fought off a gang of thugs			0
that energy and urgency would leave him frustrated for much of his acting life			0
he complained bitterly about the endless sitting - around , the inactivity and small - talk that made up much of an actor ’s life , especially on film sets			1
stars of the professionals : @entity36 ( left to right ) , @entity49 and @entity27 on the set of the series which first aired in 1977 instead of traipsing round auditions , his first job after @entity155 was at @entity181 where he taught drama to deaf - and - dumb children , learning sign language so he could communicate with them			1
his first tv part came in the police drama @entity186 in 1974 , but his breakthrough was with the three - in - a - bedsit @entity190 sex comedy , @entity192 , with @entity193 and @entity194			1
they were hard - up newlyweds , he was the lodger who constantly tried to seduce his landlady			1
meanwhile , @entity199 , principal screenwriter of the quirkily @entity201 spy series @entity202 , was trying to cast a more brutal , less eccentric follow - up , something with a sour punch to match the @entity207 mood			1
he hired @entity36 and tried him out alongside the golden - haired @entity208 , later famous as lord @entity209 in @entity209 — but the chemistry was missing			1
then @entity199 remembered a 1976 episode of @entity213 , where @entity36 played opposite a brooding actor who seemed to rub him up the wrong way			1
deadly : during the hit tv show his character was licensed to use ' any means necessary ' , including beating his suspects to jelly and shooting to kill on - screen and off , they circled round each other , one snarl away from a punch - up			1
this was the tension the new show needed			0
he was called to audition for a bit - part , without realising the producers were sizing him up for a lead role , and was disconcerted by the way they stared at him			1
bristling and defensive , he looked ideal , and five days later he was filming the first episode			0
budgets were tight and the actors sometimes had to rest in their cars on location			0
as their fame grew , they learned to dread being woken by the shout of , ‘ hey , look who it is ’ , and a crowd of young fans hammering on the car windows			0
the professionals ran for five series and made @entity27 a star and a national sex symbol			2
as one wag said : ‘ men want to be him , women want to be patted down by him			0
’ his character was foul - mouthed and sexist , with an explosive temper			2
though only 5ft 11in , he could lift bigger men by the lapels and throw them across the room			0
when one girlfriend tried to slap him , he dumped her in a horse trough			0
the hard punches and dockside language sparked controversy and calls for @entity264 to cancel the show			0
career : the @entity18 actor also starred in a drama about serial killer @entity269 one episode was shelved : the @entity271 , where @entity22 and @entity23 fought white supremacists , revealed @entity22 apparently had racist sympathies			1
after he was stabbed by a black gang member , @entity22 was tended in hospital by a voluptuous @entity278 nurse , whose tender ministrations overcame his prejudices			1
by the end of the episode he was dating her			0
in 1982 , as @entity12 was ending , @entity27 auditioned to become the new @entity284			0
the right man at the wrong time , he would have been perfect for the modern @entity284 movies , as a tough but damaged 007			2
producer @entity288 took five seconds to consider @entity27 , all short fuse and suppressed violence , and decide that he did n’t want him			0
instead , @entity27 played an @entity69 captain in a film based on the @entity294 embassy siege , @entity295 , and went on to be typecast in shoddy war movies such as @entity297 : @entity298 and @entity299			1
father : @entity27 had three sons , @entity78 , @entity302 and @entity303 and was photographed picking one of his children up from a sports event in @entity42 in 2011 he burned off energy with marathon walks for charity , flying and sky - diving : when he and his teacher wife @entity311 had the first of their three children , they named him @entity315 , because to @entity27 the sky was the best place in the world			1
in despair at doing tv work such as a gameshow version of @entity323 , in which he played @entity324 , @entity27 moved his family to @entity42			1
he studied film directing at the @entity327 , and tried to make his fortune with a computer company surfing the tech explosion			0
but though his last tv appearance was in 2002 in @entity332 , he never abandoned his acting ambitions			0
last summer , ill health forced him to withdraw from 1066 , a film based on the @entity336 , in which he was to play the @entity201 @entity338 ’s father , the warlord @entity337 , @entity337			0
he might have thought that fans had forgotten him			0
but the extraordinary outpouring of affection as news of his death spread on social media yesterday proves how fondly he was remembered			0
@entity27 yearned for action , but he was at his most charismatic when he was motionless — sullen , smouldering , like a blow waiting to fall			0
as countless women , and a fair few men , recalled on @entity349 yesterday , he was their first crush			0
and you never forget that .			0

the @entity18 actor played agent @entity22 in the series which began in 1977
he was also a part - time *para-trooper* from @entity67 , @entity357
senior officers said he could not join the @entity69 because he was a celebrity
died *peacefully* at his home in @entity42 surrounded by his family
