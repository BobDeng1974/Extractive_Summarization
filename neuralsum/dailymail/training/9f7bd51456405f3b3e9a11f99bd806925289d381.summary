' i also take into account that offences such as this dent public confidence in the charity affected			1
' the point has been made that this likely effect has been very damaging for @entity10 and the public are likely to question how safe their donation are and whether they should be made at all			0

it was emblazoned on all the equipment			0
' it was a weekly event that these vehicles would be sent out to mostly supermarket car parks			0
they would stay there for three or four days			0
' the employees either stayed in the vehicle overnight or stayed fairly cheaply in a hotel			0
they were given money for food			0

representing @entity0 , @entity188 said his business had gone into liquidation in 2011 , at the same time as the fraud was investigated			2
miss @entity188 said @entity0 set up the collections after deciding it was a “ brilliant idea ” to combine his interest in ex-military vehicles with @entity10			1
however , the vehicles were difficult to maintain and required expensive maintenance , which @entity0 had to do himself , she said			2
miss @entity188 added : ' it has been very hard for him to come to terms with that for which he has been accused			0

' instead he was stealing from them and using the money for his own personal gain through a deceptive web of fraud which took detectives three years to untangle			0

many of those defrauded by him have contacted us to express shock that someone would use organised and criminal tactics to prevent money supporting the wounded			0
