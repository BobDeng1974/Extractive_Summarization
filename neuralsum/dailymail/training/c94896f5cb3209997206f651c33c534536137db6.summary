by @entity0 for @entity1 crowds watched in horror as an escapologist misjudged his act , leaving him dangling upside down by a single burning rope			0
@entity7 was wriggling out of a strait - jacket suspended by burning ropes during a performance in @entity11 , @entity12 when the accident happened			1
the daredevil did n't realise that high winds would speed up the time it took the flames to burn through the ropes , meaning he had to dislocate his shoulder before being lowered to the ground			0
he was attempting to escape from a strait - jacket as he hung , suspended upside , from three burning ropes			1
but the crowds who had gathered for the event were left shocked when the fire burned through two of the ropes too quickly			2
mr @entity7 was left suspended by just one rope and was lowered to the ground after dislocating his shoulder			1
he said : ' the ropes burned through too quickly			2
i can usually count on 60 seconds before the first rope burns through , but it was more like 45 seconds , which was too fast			0
' the second rope went after 60 seconds and the third would have been another 30 seconds before that burned through			0
@entity7 pictured with the remains of his burning ropes after the event in @entity11 earlier this month mr @entity7 initially hung from three burning ropes but was left dangling by one after two were quickly destroyed he added : ' i had to pop my right shoulder to get free more quickly and the safety team were all for lowering me before i 'd got out of the strait jacket , but i was determined i was going to do it			1
' the stunt is the latest accident mr @entity7 has been involved in and he previously burned himself performing a similar trick			1
in 2012 , a burning rope he was suspended from snapped midway during his show and set his trousers on fire			0
