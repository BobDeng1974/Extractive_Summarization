@entity0 held his first press conference on thursday after the former @entity3 boss accepted the top job at @entity5			1
@entity6 gave updates from @entity8			1
@entity0 talks on the phone as he watches @entity5 in training on wednesday afternoon host commentator here 's one final picture of the @entity13 in his new role ... and that ’s it			1
not a single question from the floor about @entity3			1
suspect there will be when he speaks separately to the @entity22 media now			1
i think @entity0 will be hoping his pre-match press conferences are n’t this long			1
‘ i ’m not sure many @entity26 coaches have been offered too many opportunities			1
‘ but i ’ve been given an opportunity to come here and i think it ’s right for me			1
they ’ve got a bit of @entity33 in this part of the world			1
@entity36 came here and did a brilliant job			1
i hope i can add to that			1
‘ i will add staff in time			1
i ca n’t tell you how many people want to come and work here			2
i ca n't tell you how many players want to come and work here			2
’ ‘ i want to come here and stand on my own feet			2
i want to show i can work here			2
i need help with the people here			2
i will add to my staff as time goes on			2
but it ’s easier to see what i need , make a more informed decision , once i can see what i need			2
’ ‘ i ’ve enjoyed @entity55			2
there ’s thing i will change			2
i look forward to bringing my methods			2
i think one of my strengths is working on the field			2
the one direction we have to go is up the league			2
’ ‘ there were never any doubts but a family decision had to be taken			2
it was just making sure the family was supportive and everyone was looking forward to coming to live in @entity8			1
i had great support from my wife , my dad and my children			2
’ ‘ yes , i have had several opportunities to go back into management			2
but i felt i needed the break			2
‘ i really hope my side will show personality			1
a lot of flexibility and attacking options			2
i am a fan of football			2
‘ but i also want to win , and in the end i care more about winning than anything else			2
the job here is to win			1
’ ‘ i am planning to meet him next week			2
i ’ve met him before when i played him in the @entity89 and when i went up to watch them at @entity92			1
if he ’s fine with it i ’d like to meet him			2
’ ' i have to assess the players we have here first			0
but the transfer window is five or six weeks away and the president and the sporting director have said they will do all they can to help me			0
’ ‘ i had the choice			0
the president gave me the opportunity			0
but i had a six - year contract at @entity3 and i lasted nine months			1
so do n’t get too caught up in the length of the contract			0
i do n’t pay much attention to that			0
’ ' probably more @entity108			0
i ’m tough with them , i work hard			0
i had 11 great years at @entity110 and i took over a club very similar to this and we grew it and got better and better			1
i ’m hoping i can do exact the same here and all the vibes , all the messages , say i can			0
’ so far so good for @entity0 here			1
saying all the right things			0
‘ it ’s got a great history			0
it 's one of the big clubs			0
i want to work at a big club			0
i want to get success			0
it ’s a chance to work with the good people here but i also think it ’s a good team			0
' the attraction was the club , the team , and the opportunity to work in such a great country in a great league			0
’ ' @entity132 told me i was a lucky man coming to a beautiful city and a great football club			0
he spoke very highly about the academy			0
he was very positive about the club			0
’ ‘ i see the players being better than what they are showing at this time			0
i think there ’s more they can give			0
the first objective is to avoid relegation but my expectations are high and i want a winning team			0
’ ‘ me and the president have had some long conversations			0
but i had to be sure i was climbing to a club with ambition , because i want to win			0
we ’ve only won two games this season but hopefully we can improve on that			1
i see great morale among the players since i ’ve been here and i think i have been lifted by the result they had last sunday			0
’ we are now hearing a run of questions for the club 's president , with the translator whispering what is being said in the new manager ’s left ear			1
‘ i knew a lot about @entity5 from a long time back			1
i came here in 1982/83			0
i was with @entity166 when we played @entity5			1
i know all about the club , about the city			0
i also went to see @entity169 in @entity92 when they qualified for the @entity170			0
i ’m looking forward to getting stuck right into the job			1
i feel the job fits my character			1
’ ‘ @entity169 have had a great history of having @entity26 managers			0
and some of the greatest @entity26 managers have come and worked in @entity179			1
i ’m not putting myself at their level but this is an opportunity to test myself against the best and hopefully i can do well here			0
’ ' @entity179 has overtaken the @entity183 because of the quality of the teams getting regularly into the latter stages of the @entity89			1
’ ' you know it 's not my style			0
' ' i never had any doubt			0
i had several offers to manage in the @entity183			0
i spoke to several clubs in other leagues			0
but the only club that pulled me was sociedad			1
' ' i 'm well rested i 've had six months off , i 'm ready			0
' ' it was a big ambition of mine to manage abroad			0
to be completely fulfilled as a coach you need to try all the cultures			0
' ' what convinced me was the ( club 's ) president			0
he was fantastically passionate about his club : how special it is , his love for the club pulled me			0
' @entity208 - sound familiar ? @entity209 - ever heard of him ? @entity0 will have two former @entity183 players to take charge of in the form of the one - time @entity214 and @entity215 players			1
click here for more on the players in @entity5 's squad			1
they ’ve found an @entity222 chap to translate @entity0 from @entity22 to @entity223 and then @entity224 , and everyone else from @entity223 , to @entity224 and then @entity22			1
at least i think that ’s what ’s happening			0
the poor chap just asked us if there ’s a distinction between ‘ head coach ’ and ‘ manager ’			1
( @entity234 , looks like this could get rather complicated ... ) ... we 'll be hearing from mr @entity0 live in the next few minutes			1
there is a genuine sense of excitement here			0
a feeling that they have landed a seriously big fish for their modest football club			0
this morning the local paper devoted 10 pages to @entity0 , including an interview with @entity246			1
comments from my good self were rather less prominent , it has to be said			0
after arriving at the club 's @entity251 training ground on wednesday , @entity0 ran the rule over his new players , and was spotted talking on the phone while wearing a big grin			1
hello , is that @entity257 ... ? @entity0 had better get used to smaller crowds : while @entity260 holds a mighty 75,000 supporters , @entity5 's @entity259 has a capacity of 32,000 and last season 's average attendance was around 22,500			1
click here to read @entity267 's man in @entity224 , @entity266 , giving his guided tour of @entity5 , from the ground and facilities to the local expectations and the history of this famous club			1
conference room filling up here but reports of 100 @entity22 journalists something of an exaggeration			1
for @entity281 it is that the @entity5 hierarchy have asked their new manager to mould the club in the image of @entity110 : a tough , streetwise team built on a base of young players and barqain buys			1
click here to read more from our chief sports reporter @entity6 on the task facing @entity169 's new boss in this beautiful corner of @entity224			1
when @entity0 was sacked by @entity3 just seven months ago , did you anticipate that his next job would be in @entity179 ? not at a high - flying club either - a struggling club from the @entity223 country , where money is tight and the squad is reliant on youth players			1
it 's quite a challenge facing @entity0 - although his track record at @entity305 and @entity110 shows it may be a situation that suits the 51 - year - old down to the ground			1
you might be more familiar with the usual greeting of ' hola ' in @entity224 but in the @entity223 country the above means hello			0
@entity0 gives his first press conference as @entity5 manager at 4pm today , and we 'll bring you the best of what the @entity13 tells the media after accepting the top job at @entity179 's 15th - placed club .			1
