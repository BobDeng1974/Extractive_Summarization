once an annual round of exclusive balls , refined dinner parties and other polished social events , the @entity3 season – the highlight of which was the debutante ball - was an important way for the elite to match make the younger generations			1
today however , not only has the ball has lost its royal patronage , but is barely recognisable from its aristocratic origins			2
held this year in @entity16 , which plays host to popular @entity20 drama @entity18 , the ball is increasingly popular among affluent foreigners and mega-rich @entity22 looking to experience a piece of @entity22 's cultured past while simultaneously putting their wealth on display			1
no longer an event for an elite group of the @entity22 aristocracy , the @entity32 's @entity58 , this year held at @entity16 , near @entity63 , is now open essentially to anyone who can afford it			1
this year the excited debutantes also had the opportunity to play at being the @entity42 as they spent hours preening in the now famous castle before their sweeping entrance into the ball			0
the historical ball is steeped in traditions , but many claim is barely recognisable from its aristocratic origins each debutante will have been selected – and paid thousands of pounds - for the privilege of taking months of etiquette classes and dabbling in carefully chosen charity projects the ladies being ‘ presented ’ are still a rather spectacular vision in a sea of cream silks , chiffon and lace debutantes prepare to take their places for a meal during the @entity32 's ball at @entity16 with tables starting at £ 2,500 and run by a partnership of corporate sponsors and companies based in the @entity95 , attendance is strictly for the well - to - do , with many traditionalists bemoaning the loss of the balls gentile and refined roots			1
and while the young ladies being ‘ presented ’ are still a rather spectacular vision in a sea of cream silks and lace , their place at the ball will have been purchased , rather than a birth right			2
apparently celebrating their year of charity fund raising , etiquette classes and ‘ debut ’ on the dating scene at @entity114 's @entity107 , most young ladies take the opportunity to have a bespoke designer dress made for the night			1

debutante @entity119 applies lipstick in her dressing room before the start of the ball during the ball the debutantes are presented to guests and curtsy to the @entity127 ( pictured ) after the ceremony the ladies are allowed to change into a dress of their choosing for the after party - with most years leading to tales of debauchery the young ladies , usually aged between 17 and 20 then finish their debutante experience by attending the grand ball where they are presented to guests and curtsey to the @entity127			2
prior to the event older debutantes are on hand to guide and critique the girls on their dress , dancing and pace around the ballroom and on the day an army of professional hair and make - up artists are on hand to make sure that the girls are glowing , setting off perfectly coiffed up ' dos with diamond studded tiaras and precious jewellery			2
the ' deb of the year ' is chosen according to ' who has worked hardest ’ during fund - raising activities throughout the season and shown the most enthusiasm			0
on the day an army of professional hair and make - up artists are on hand to make sure that the girls are glowing , the young ladies , usually aged between 17 and 20 , try on their couture gowns before the start of the ball the grand ball room at @entity16 was the venue for the after dinner dancing at this years ball the @entity171 ’s sister , princess @entity172 famously said of the end of the royal patronage of the ball : ‘ we had to put a stop to it			1
every tart in @entity3 was getting in ! ’ after the ceremony the ladies are allowed to change into a dress of their choosing for the after party - with most years leading to tales of debauchery and behaviour most unfitting for a lady			0
the ball has been running almost every year since 1780 , when @entity189 first organised the @entity32 ’s ball as a way to celebrate his wife ’s birthday			1
the ceremony remained unchanged - with debutantes paying respects to a large iced cake at @entity56 , overseen by the monarch - until 1958 , when prince @entity199 persuaded the @entity171 to stop receiving each year ’s crop at @entity201			0
@entity199 is said to have complained that the annual ball , at which girls aged 17 and 18 were expected to meet their suitably - moneyed future husbands , was ‘ bloody daft ’			0
the @entity171 ’s sister , @entity172 , was even more forthright , saying later ‘ we had to put a stop to it			0
every tart in @entity3 was getting in ! ’ since 1958 the ball was held sporadically at various exclusive venues in the capital to varying degrees of success before being relaunched in 2009 and held annually since , albeit without its royal seal of approval .			0
