by @entity0 the @entity2 football team has posed with a banner proclaiming the @entity4 belong to @entity2 before a @entity6 warm - up match			1
prior to their game against @entity8 in @entity9 which they won 2 - 0 , the banner , bearing the slogan ' @entity4 son @entity13 ' , translated into @entity15 as ' the @entity4 are @entity2 ' was unfurled			1
the @entity4 is the @entity17 name for the @entity19 territory , which has had @entity21 sovereignty since 1833			1
the war led to the deaths of 255 @entity21 military personnel as well as 649 @entity2			2
@entity2 has long laid claim to sovereignty of the islands and the message displayed by the team seems to show support for the country 's claims			1
since president @entity46 took power in 2007 , there have been repeated diplomatic clashes with @entity21 over the territory			0
@entity2 president @entity46 , who said earlier this year that her nation was ' forcibly stripped ' of the @entity4 earlier this year , she insisted that her nation was ‘ forcibly stripped ’ of the @entity4 in a ‘ blatant exercise of 19th century colonialism			1
’ in april , @entity2 also accused @entity21 of provocative behaviour by planning to carry out military exercises in the @entity4			1
mrs @entity46 was quoted as saying : ' history shows that colonial enclaves are always recovered			0
' but despite the claims , people on the islands voted by 1,513 to three in favour of remaining @entity21 in a referendum last year , which prime minister @entity62 said ' could not have sent a clearer message '			2
a @entity21 taskforce was sent to the @entity4 in 1982 after @entity2 invaded the @entity21 territory the banner was unfurled before @entity2 recorded a 2 - 0 victory against @entity8 in @entity9 the @entity6 kicks off in @entity69 on thursday with @entity2 's opening match of the tournament coming against @entity72 on sunday			1
earlier this month it was revealed that at the height of the @entity4 crisis , the @entity21 government agonised over whether to demand @entity21 teams withdraw from the 1982 @entity6 in @entity17 , amid fears they might have had to play @entity2			1
@entity80 , @entity81 and @entity82 all qualified for the tournament and papers released by the @entity85 at @entity86 , west @entity79 showed that prior to the competition , the government were concerned that playing @entity2 would be unacceptable			0
@entity17 's @entity88 who could receive an almost £ 600,000 bonus if his country lift the @entity6 in @entity69 @entity17 politicians have reacted with anger after it was revealed the country 's national team will receive an almost £ 600,000 bonus if they win the @entity6 in @entity69			2
captain @entity97 and vice-captain @entity98 signed the deal with @entity17 's football federation last week on behalf of the 23 players , which will see them receive 720,000 euros ( £ 585,365 ) if they lift the trophy			2
it marks an increase from the 600,000 euros ( £ 487,804 ) each player received when their country won the 2010 tournament in @entity110			0
mps @entity111 and @entity113 of the opposition @entity114 criticised the premium as ' disproportionate ' and ' an insult to citizens ' given the recent economic crisis			0
@entity17 's economy began to crumble in 2008 with the collapse of its bloated property sector and unemployment soared to 26.1 % at the close of 2013			2
mp @entity125 said she would raise the matter of the squad 's premium in parliament and lambasted football for being ' another world ' where ' there is no crisis '			0
each member will receive a payment of 360,000 euros ( £ 292,682 ) if the team reach the final , and 180,000 euros ( £ 146,341 ) if they make the semi-finals			0
but @entity139 and @entity17 midfielder @entity88 said such payments were ' sometimes used against us ' , but that he would be playing ' with the same enthusiasm i had as a child , in a bid to try and win another @entity6 , without thinking about all the rest			0
' the @entity148 winner will be awarded £ 20.8 million by @entity149 , football 's governing body , but many say the money should go towards programmes that promote the game at all levels .			0
