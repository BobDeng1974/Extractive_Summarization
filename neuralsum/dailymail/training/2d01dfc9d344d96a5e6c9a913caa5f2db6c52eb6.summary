a @entity1 official told @entity2 on thursday that looming protests by state lawmakers and a need to protect attorney general @entity7 's image among law enforcement officers caused him to pull out of a planned speech in @entity10			1
@entity7 's public schedule shows that he was to ' deliver remarks at the @entity14 â€™s 130th police academy graduation ceremony			1
' that address did n't occur , however			2
seven @entity10 legislators were preparing to lead a crowd of hundreds in protests across the street , most calling for @entity7 's impeachment			1
' look , the attorney general is n't afraid of a few protesters , ' the @entity1 source said			1
' but you have to understand that it 's legacy building time around here , and no one wants him to get a reputation as the guy who brought chaos to a police ceremony			2
' ' he 's the nation 's top law enforcement officer			1
what kind of message would that send ? and it could have been a pr disaster for the president			0
' just could n't make it : possible pr disaster : @entity7 , the @entity43 attorney general , canceled a speaking engagement at a police academy graduation ceremony , reportedly over concerns about protesters and his post-career legacy location : the @entity50 in @entity10 was destroyed by a truck bomb blast in april 1995 ; @entity7 's speech -- and the impeachment protests -- were to have taken place across the street the @entity1 ignored a request for comment through official channels , but the official spoke on condition of anonymity			1
the @entity62 was first to report on the cancellation , attributing it to a protest planned by state rep. @entity66 , a @entity67 who believes @entity7 should be impeached following a 2012 finding of criminal contempt by the @entity43 @entity71			1
the @entity71 's action , a precedent - setting step against a presidential cabinet member , came after @entity7 's long - held refusal to comply with a @entity71 subpoena for documents related to the @entity79 gun - walking scandal			1
@entity66 told @entity2 that @entity7 ' was definitely avoiding a national embarrassment ' by canceling			2
' it would have been in all the papers , photos of people holding signs saying " @entity87 , " can you imagine ? " ' @entity88 ' of people would have turned out , @entity66 said , but most decided not to come once @entity7 sent his regrets			2
' we had a little over 100 come , and that was after he canceled , ' he boasted			0
' we had seven lawmakers lined up to speak , all of them calling for his impeachment			0
' ' @entity7 has been held in contempt of @entity97 , ' @entity66 said in defense of his impeachment demand			2
awkward : @entity7 often speaks in controlled settings , like this @entity101 and @entity103 speaker series on wednesday , but seldom presses the flesh in public ' @entity97 could do this today			0
there are a number of articles they could bring for impeachment			0
@entity79 is at the top of the list because there 's blood on his hands			0
' that failed operation put more than 2,000 firearms in the hands of @entity122 drug cartel members , in the hope that their movements could be traced			0
more than 300 @entity122 nationals , and at least one @entity43 @entity127 agent , lost their lives when those firearms ended up where they were intended to go			0
@entity66 , a @entity67 state legislator in @entity10 , had planned protests against @entity7 for his apparent work to stymie a congressional inquiry into the botched @entity79 -- a pattern that has brought cries for impeachment ' it is true that mr. @entity7 will not be in attendance , ' @entity14 spokesman capt. @entity137 told the @entity62			1
' we are told that it is not due to the planned protests , but no reason was stated			2
' the attorney general is expected to step down after this year 's congressional midterm election , and reportedly plans a flurry of lasting policy changes before his departure			1
one , announced just days ago in conjunction with the @entity150 , is a change in the criteria used when evaluating clemency applications from nonviolent drug offenders in federal prisons			0
@entity66 also cited that decision , along with a ' porous ' @entity43 border and ' voter intimidation , ' as reasons @entity7 should be removed from office			1
rep. @entity161 , the @entity162 @entity67 who chairs the powerful @entity163 , is poised to become the latest burr under the ag 's saddle as he skips @entity167			0
@entity161 and 16 other @entity71 members , all republicans , wrote to @entity7 thursday to demand cooperation as they probe who the @entity1 considered prosecuting conservative tax - exempt groups that were also targeted by the @entity172 in what has erupted into a major scandal			1
last week the center - right group @entity175 released documents from inside the @entity172 indicating that former @entity172 official @entity177 had back - and - forth communications with the @entity1 about the potential for criminal charges to be brought			2
@entity182 groups were the most widely and intensely targeted in that scheme			0
they rose in prominence during the 2010 congressional midterm election season			0
@entity67 believe @entity177 , who headed the @entity172 office tasked with vetting and monitoring nonprofit groups , conspired to hobble them because of their political beliefs .			0

@entity43 attorney general was to address police academy graduates in @entity10 on thursday
the speech was canceled at the last minute , but the @entity1 would n't say whether planned protests had anything to do with the decision
seven state legislators there had planned to publicly call for @entity7 's impeachment at the ceremony
a @entity1 official says @entity7 does n't fear protesters , but is *conscious* of his image as the nation 's top law enforcer during his last months in office
the speech was to have taken place in the shadow of the @entity50 , which was the target of a bombing in 1996
