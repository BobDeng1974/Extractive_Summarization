@entity1 ’s father was cold and a bully , not to mention a shameless womaniser , but — too young to understand mental illness — his daughter always blamed the alarming behaviour of her manic depressive mother for the break - up of her parents ’ marriage			1
the future @entity12 sex symbol , left - wing firebrand and fitness queen felt abandoned by a mother who seemed to have time only for her little brother , @entity17			1
when her mother — the beautiful but fragile @entity19 socialite @entity18 , @entity1 ’s second wife — was allowed home briefly from a psychiatric institution ( shadowed by nurses because she was on suicide watch ) , she called out desperately for @entity1			1

unperturbed , @entity40 performed on @entity41 that night as usual			0
he did n’t even give their two children the farewell letters their mother had written them , and insisted that she had died of a heart attack			0
always outspoken , @entity1 is making headlines once more after she returned to the subject of her tragic mother at the weekend , in a speech at a fundraising event in @entity53 for a rape victims ’ charity			1
@entity1 's father , @entity40 who was cold and a bully the audience of philanthropists and activists was stunned when the 76 - year - old actress revealed that her mother had killed herself after being sexually abused from the age of eight			1
after looking through her mother ’s medical records , @entity1 discovered her terrible secret			1
she said : ‘ the minute that i read that , everything fell into place			0
’ she did n’t say who had been responsible , but made clear it explained a lot			0
‘ i knew [ the reason for ] the promiscuity , the endless plastic surgery , the guilt , the inability to love or be intimate , and i was able to forgive her and forgive myself , ’ she said			0
friends say that her mother ’s suicide was the single most formative event in @entity1 ’s multi- faceted life			1
in truth , however , abuse allegedly suffered by her mother during her childhood is just one of many unpleasant details in the history of the @entity12 acting dynasty			1
@entity40 was a rising star in 1936 when he met @entity18 on the set of a @entity89 film , @entity90 , which he was making in @entity93 , @entity94			2
after a whirlwind romance , she chivvied him into getting married			0
@entity18 was the daughter of an @entity97 industrialist whose family claimed ancestry from @entity101 ’s third wife @entity100 – a fact that was reflected in @entity1 ’s full name being @entity104			1
@entity1 has told friends she believes her mother was sexually abused by a piano tuner			1
she believe the ordeal left @entity108 traumatised , and turned her into a promiscuous adolescent who had nine abortions before @entity1 was born			1

as a mother of two young children , the flighty and self - absorbed @entity18 ignored her daughter , who she left to be brought up by nannies			1
her father was no better , preferring to fly kites with the movie star @entity118 than spend time with his children			0
@entity40 with @entity1 's mother @entity108 who had nine abortions before she was born although he played many of cinema ’s most memorable ‘ heroic ’ roles , in films such as @entity126 and @entity127 , off - screen , @entity1 was a useless father and unfaithful husband			1
@entity18 was diagnosed with bipolar disorder after the birth of @entity17 in 1940			2
discovering that her husband was cheating on her with other women , @entity18 went to desperate lengths to regain his attention			1
she would walk around naked in front of him and even crawl on her hands and knees to him , begging him to talk to her			0
moving from @entity144 to @entity19 when @entity1 got a role on @entity41 , @entity18 sank further into depression — and her behaviour became ever more alarming to her young children			1
terrified she was losing her looks , she would spend hours in her darkened bedroom , wearing a chin strap and eye pads to keep her skin youthful			0
she had plastic surgery long before it was commonplace , and once confided to @entity1 that if she ever put on weight , she would cut it off with a knife			2
she finally went over the edge in 1949 when @entity1 asked for a divorce to marry his 20 - year - old mistress , @entity160			1
@entity18 suffered a mental breakdown and had repeated stays in psychiatric hospitals , sometimes being confined in a straitjacket			2
rather than comfort a woman who was descending into madness , her husband ’s main concern was for the damage it would cause to his career if word got out his wife was in a ‘ loony bin ’			2
weeks before being placed on suicide watch , @entity18 stayed with a friend in @entity178 who , one night , caught her staring wild - eyed into the mirror			1
@entity18 finally went over the edge in 1949 when her husband @entity40 asked for a divorce to marry his 20 - year - old mistress , @entity160 ‘ i wonder where the jugular vein is ? ’ she murmured as she caressed her throat			1
it was a horribly prescient remark			0
@entity1 only learned the awful truth about her mother ’s suicide months later when a fellow school pupil showed her a report in a film magazine			1
her brother @entity17 did n’t know for years			0
by then , having been packed off to boarding school where she had nightmares every night about her dead mother , @entity1 wrote to her father about her terrors			1
@entity40 returned her letters with her grammatical errors highlighted in red ink , refusing ever to discuss the suicide			0
@entity1 inherited her mother ’s obsession with her looks			1
she became a teenage bulimic , a condition that was aggravated by her perfectionist father who would tell her she was getting fat @entity1 inherited her mother ’s obsession with her looks			1
she became a teenage bulimic , a condition that was aggravated by her perfectionist father , who would badger her continually — and unfairly — that she was getting fat			1
@entity1 has said that she was ‘ made to feel i would not be loved unless i was perfect ’			2
as she admits , her icy father instilled in her a desperate obsession with pleasing men			0
described as a chameleon even by her own children , @entity1 radically transformed herself to suit the controlling men in her life			2
@entity223 film director @entity222 , whom she married in 1965 , cemented her sex symbol image with the sci - fi film barbarella			1
@entity1 wed @entity223 film director @entity222 in 1965 @entity1 has described him as a ‘ nicer version of my father ’ , which — given that @entity222 was an alcoholic , gambler and compulsive philanderer — was a damning verdict on @entity40			1
they enjoyed an image as one of the world ’s most glamorous couples			0
however , @entity222 — the ex- husband of @entity237 — had persuaded @entity1 to accept an open marriage			1
according to her , it started when he brought home a red - headed high - class call girl			0
stifling her anger and jealousy , she subsequently ‘ threw myself into the sex ’			0
she duly started picking up girls for threesomes , or more			0
‘ i took my cues from him and threw myself into the threesome with the skill and enthusiasm of the actress i am , ’ says @entity1			2
‘ i was doing it to keep a man happy			0
’ but @entity222 made no secret of the fact that he regarded @entity1 as a second - rate @entity237			1
his infidelity , and her growing attraction to radical politics , ended their marriage after eight years			0
next , she wed left - wing activist @entity264 after meeting during her fateful visit to @entity266 in 1972			0
many @entity97 will never forgive ‘ @entity1 ’ for her anti-war stance			2
as with @entity222 , @entity1 sacrificed herself for @entity264 , who made her live in a small bungalow in @entity269 and do all the laundry by hand , because he did n’t approve of washing machines			2
friends say he resented her fame , but he happily lived off the money it brought to launch his political career			0
after she discovered @entity264 was cheating on her , she was snapped up by @entity278 , founder of the @entity280 tv channel			0
a notorious womaniser , he forced her to give up acting and become a trophy wife			0
a month after their wedding , she discovered he had a mistress			0
but it was her new - found christianity that finally ended their ten - year marriage when @entity278 left her			0
@entity1 wed left - wing activist @entity264 ( right ) after meeting during her fateful visit to @entity266 in 1972 she appears finally to have found contentment with her current partner , music producer @entity292 , with whom she has been since 2009			2
but still , the memory of her mother ’s suicide still haunts her			2
as @entity1 confided to a friend , she was once afraid that she , too , might kill herself , but she later realised that she never would			2
why ? ‘ because life is too damn interesting , and i think i ’m too important			0
