by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor president @entity4 ’s aggressive and controversial @entity3 grew out of a draft proposal from one of @entity1 's richest environmental activist groups , it emerged monday			1
the @entity8 , which spent $ 41 million of its $ 210 million nest egg last year pushing for changes in energy policy , circulated a 110 - page document in 2012 that outlined what would become the president 's latest salvo in the global - warming wars			1
now that the @entity4 administration has adopted the green - group 's plan , the @entity8 's insider status is widely seen as an in - your - face response to oil , gas and coal companies that had a seat at the table 13 years ago when then - vice president @entity27 convened meetings in secret to chart future energy policy			1
while the @entity34 administration focused on extracting as much energy out of the ground as legally possible , the current @entity32 's policy is to erect roadblocks in the path of ' big coal ' while rewarding alternative energy speculators with loan guarantees and other sources of public funds			1
as with the @entity75 law , however , state - based solutions could result in a patchwork quilt of crisscrossing rules that aggravate tensions between businesses and the @entity32 , while opening up the floodgates for a wealth of legal avenues by lawsuit - waving opponents			2
@entity85 regulators were among a narrow group of stakeholders who got private briefings on the proposal beginning in 2012 , and based their eventual written rules on what they heard			0
' once enacted , ' the @entity93 reported on monday , the new @entity85 regime ' could do far more than just shut down coal plants ; it could spur a transformation of the nation ’s electricity sector			0
' such a wholesale shift is high on the list of @entity8 's priorities , and its three activists who wrote the proposal – and frequently advocate for green policies with government agencies – had all the resources they wanted to pull it off , according to an @entity8 insider			1
' this was the most talked - about thing going on inside the organization , ' the veteran @entity109 activist told @entity112			0
' nothing else we were doing – not pollution control or @entity116 [ @entity117 ] work or marine protected areas – nothing had as much juice behind it			0
' ' of course , fundraising was always a trump card , but other than that , the carbon policy team got everything it wanted and pretty much had a blank check			0
' the statistical analysis alone coast ' a few hundred thousand dollars , ' @entity8 lawyer @entity128 told the @entity93			2
@entity128 wrote the document along with fellow lawyer @entity132 and @entity133 , an activist described by the @entity93 as a ' climate scientist			2
' @entity133 holds a @entity136 bachelor 's degree in physics and mathematics , and a @entity139 from an ' @entity141 ' program that describes its goal not in research terms but as a policy outcome : ' a sus ­ tain ­ able envi ­ ron ­ ment and a just society			1
' outsize influence : @entity8 president @entity151 ( 2nd l ) draws big names to fundraising events , including @entity156 founder @entity155 ( @entity152 ) and @entity158 executive chairman @entity157 ( 2nd @entity159 ) not dying off : an @entity1 climate scientist was recently forced into retirement after being accused of falsifying data to show polar bears were drowning because polar ice caps had melted endangered species : coal production in the @entity1 is under fire as the @entity32 -- with help from the @entity8 -- seeks to muscle it out of @entity1 's energy picture before co-authoring what became the @entity4 @entity32 's latest climate rules , he helped draft the @entity176 's failed ' cap and trade ' carbon emissions bill			1
@entity133 recently left the @entity8 to take the reins at @entity178 , a think - tank sidecar on @entity180 , a wealthy super pac bankrolled by liberal climate activist billionaire @entity57			1
@entity57 plans to put $ 100 million in play this year electing politicians who embrace his pac 's desire to ' avert climate disaster			1
' @entity128 told @entity112 on monday that the @entity8 was ' unsolicited by @entity85 or others in the @entity186 , ' and that his group ' briefed @entity85 and others around that time , at our initiative			2
' he also emphasized that ' no funder came to us to do this work			0
' @entity27 's @entity195 , which delivered a report to the president in may 2001 , was a body solely comprised of government officials			0
but it held about 40 meetings with energy - policy stakeholders – mostly those on the business side			2
@entity205 groups were given a chance to preset their case , but only after the task force 's initial report was already drafted			0
@entity8 lawyer @entity128 ( @entity152 ) helped draft the climate change proposal that the @entity32 embraced , while his co-author @entity133 now works with billionaire global - warming crusader @entity57 ( r ) president @entity4 told the @entity215 that @entity217 global warming deniers pretended they ca n't read in order to curry political favor on their right wing number - crunching : allowing computers to fill in the gaps and replace actual temperature measurements has allegedly created a ' warming ' that was never there in the first place ( source : ' @entity230 ' ) the @entity8 insider added that it was common in the organization to talk about how the environmental movement needed to ' compete with the big polluters like the @entity236 and @entity237 who directed the @entity27 energy policy in secret			1
' ' did we want to turn the tables ? hell yes			0
' theories about global warming have taken a serious hit in recent weeks with the revelation that the @entity1 @entity186 's official graph of historical surface temperatures records has been quietly altered for years			2
many of the world ’s most oft - cited climate measurements , records indicate , have been gradually replaced in at least three countries with hypothetical numbers derived from computer models			0
the result , naysayers contend , has been a faulty reading of a climate trend that has been cooling , not warming , the earth since the 1930s – despite a 10 per cent increase in carbon dioxide emissions since 1996			0
additionally , @entity1 policy wo n't impact the frenzied pace of coal - fired power plant construction in @entity267 and other @entity269 nations			0
@entity4 last jabbed at global warming skeptics during a speech at the @entity272 , saying their arguments are similar to believing the moon is made of cheese .			1

a trio of activists from the @entity8 wrote a 110 - page draft that became @entity4 's latest global - warming plan
two lawyers and a graduate of a @entity286 program advocating a ' sus ­ tainable envi ­ ron ­ ment and a just society ' *crafted* the document in 2010
the move is seen as revenge against the second @entity34 administration for allowing energy producers to advise the @entity32 in secret meetings
the document 's lead scientific author now helps run a global - warming super pac run by billionaire liberal @entity57
