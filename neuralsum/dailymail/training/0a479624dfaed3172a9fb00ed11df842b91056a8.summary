@entity0 and @entity1 could not be separated in a highly entertaining four - goal thriller at the @entity3			1
@entity4 champions @entity1 scored with just seven minutes on the clock to come away from north @entity6 with a point			1
here , @entity9 's @entity8 gives his verdict on the performance of both sets of players			2
videos scroll down to watch @entity15 scored a neat chip past @entity1 goalkeeper @entity17 in the 63rd minute @entity0 ( 4 - 1 - 4 - 1 ) @entity18 : some reasonable saves , notably one from @entity20 before half - time but unable to exude authority when @entity0 really needed him to			1
@entity24 : better going forward than in defence			2
suffered a nasty twisted ankle near the end which may rule him out for some time			2
@entity29 : rarely pretty but he and @entity30 managed to contain @entity1 for long periods			1
as captain and defensive leader will be disappointed to concede second from a set - piece			2
@entity0 defender @entity29 struggled to get to grips with @entity1 's @entity36 @entity30 : read the game well and made important blocks and interceptions			1
hit his own post in stoppage time			2
@entity43 : defensively frail , not helped with @entity44 ahead of him			2
@entity1 were ever dangerous when breaking down his side			1
@entity47 : beaten by @entity36 in build - up to the opening goal			1
strong and aggressive without the assurance of @entity52			2
@entity15 : dragged @entity0 back into the game with aggression and spirit			1
splendid first goal and key role in the second , but lucky to escape two wild kicks and a handball in his penalty box.8			1
@entity15 levelled the scoring in the second half after lobbing @entity66 team - mate @entity17 @entity67 : seemed jaded by his recent standards and off the pace , perhaps the result of his ankle injury playing for @entity72 in @entity73			1
@entity75 : excellent on the ball			1
full of energy , power and flashes of skill			0
@entity82 volley for @entity0 ’s second			0
booked for ripping shirt off			0
@entity44 : started left , moved to the right , ineffective in either position and his defensive limitations are exposed when asked to play wide			2
@entity88 : positive first half			0
good simple link - up with those around him			0
struck the post post with a cool chipped finished , but he should ’ve scored			2
suffered cramps and faded late on			2
@entity75 thought he scored the winning goal until @entity99 ' late goal @entity88 missed a golden chance to open his @entity0 account on his debut @entity103 : @entity104 ( for @entity24 81 ) , @entity105 ( for @entity88 88 ) , @entity52 ( for @entity106 95 )			1

@entity111 : happy with the draw after last season ’s problems against the big teams and with the offensive power from his team			1
showed enough character to haul themselves back into it when they seemed ready to overwhelmed			2
unable to close the game out and ultimately left to cling on for the draw			0
@entity0 boss @entity111 will be pleased with his side 's second half display @entity1 ( 4 - 4 - 1 - 1 ) @entity17 : coped well in a busy first 30 minutes			1
clean hands and decent saves but beaten twice too easily for the goals			0
@entity129 : reliably strong in defence and capable in attack			0
great challenge thwarted @entity88 early in second half			0
@entity134 : imposing physical presence and soothing figure of authority for all but the 11 - minute spell when @entity0 scored twice			2
@entity1 captain @entity134 remains a vital component in @entity141 's team @entity99 : so much more plausible with shorter hair			1
made mistakes , beaten regularly by @entity88 in the air			0
made amends with a vital equaliser with header from corner.6			0
@entity148 : @entity150 in tackle , quick to break forward and even went close to a rare goal			2
a return to the @entity3 to be proud of			0
@entity153 : showed his pace and intelligent cross for @entity36 ’s goal			1
@entity1 will regret not getting him on the ball more			1
@entity159 : often careless in possession but a destructive force who swarmed and smothered @entity0 ’s creative unit			0
@entity164 : @entity166 reminders of passing range but heavy - footed in comparison to all else around him and replace at half - time			1
@entity164 , pictured receiving a yellow card , struggled to adapt to the pace of the game @entity174 : first half on the left , second half in the centre			1
industrious and combative in both roles			0
@entity179 : sophisticated and inventive on the ball as usual , but for one horribly stray pass almost let in @entity88			0
@entity36 : robust and well - balanced			1
opened scoring with a neat finish			0
@entity0 will have been relieved to see him go off			0

not used : @entity193 , @entity194 , @entity195 , @entity196			0
@entity141 : angrily blamed the referee for more dropped points			0
his team were strong at the back under pressure from @entity0 , and sought to do their damage on the break			0
@entity187 for @entity164 gave @entity1 more attacking verve but decision to take off @entity36 was odd			1
his team has maturity and know - how and were pressing for the winner at the end			0
referee : @entity209 : both managers had their complaints but not an easy game to control			0
tried to let it flow and helped contribute to the entertainment			0
@entity215 : 60,003 @entity99 scored late on to ensure @entity1 came away with a point			1

@entity15 showed why he is rated so highly by both @entity111 and @entity218 by dictating play after the interval
@entity36 scored the opening goal of the match before @entity15 and @entity75 got on the *scoresheet*
@entity99 *rescued* a point for @entity1 with a late goal
@entity164 failed to impress on his first appearance for the *citizens*
