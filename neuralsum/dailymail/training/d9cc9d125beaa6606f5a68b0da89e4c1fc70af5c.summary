insurance firms are also being exploited by a ‘ claims manufacturing industry ’ that has ‘ gone into overdrive ’ to entice drivers into making easy claims			1
the claims are typically worth £ 2,500 a time and earn fees for claims firms and lawyers			1
yet the medical and legal tests to weed out fakers are not sufficiently stringent and the threshold for settling a claim is ‘ too low ’ , mps were told			0
brass neck : insurers have told politicians that more than half of all whiplash claims are fraudulent			2
file picture if correct , it means that at least half the estimated £ 2billion a year paid out in 550,000 whiplash claims is fraudulent , making it a £ 1billion - a - year scam			1
the disclosure confirms the @entity35 ’s dubious reputation as the ‘ whiplash capital of the world ’			1
one reason for the ‘ whiplash epidemic ’ is that it is cheaper to settle than to fight cases suspected to be fraudulent , say experts			0
fraudsters are also landing insurance payouts with ‘ cash for crash ’ scams , where they stage car crashes and then submit false claims for personal injury and damage to their vehicles			1
insurance experts already calculate that whiplash claims boosted by ‘ no - win , no - fee ’ claims firms are adding £ 90 to the average car insurance policy			1
whiplash injuries are hard to disprove as the symptoms can be easily faked			0
file picture the scale of the scandal in @entity63 and @entity64 is much greater than in countries such as @entity66 , where lawyers ’ fees are limited			1
the damning evidence came in testimony to the commons transport select committee from @entity72 , of the @entity73 , and @entity74 , of the @entity76 ’s insurance market association			0
mr @entity72 said whiplash fraud is a ‘ huge problem ’ , which has rocketed since 2007			0
he added : ‘ it is highly likely that the @entity35 is the whiplash capital of the world			2
’ claims have soared , despite a fall in accidents , because people are ‘ motivated ’ by the ease of claiming in financially tough times , he said			2
between 10 and 60 per cent of whiplash claims were ‘ exaggerated , misrepresented or fraudulent ’			0
pressed on the figures by @entity90 , mr @entity72 said the most likely total was near the upper level – or about 50 per cent of claims being fraudulent			0
victim : @entity95 mr @entity74 agreed the 50 per cent figure for bogus claims is ‘ plausible ’			0
he said members of his association ‘ suspect a lot of claims are exaggerated or fraudulent but they are not able to prove it ’			0
he added : ‘ it ’s so easy to fake , it ’s so easy to exaggerate			2
there is a claims manufacturing industry which has developed over the last ten to 15 years			2
it has gone into overdrive			0
