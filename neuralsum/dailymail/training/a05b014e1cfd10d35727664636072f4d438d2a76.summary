by @entity0 published : 04:23 est , 22 may 2012 updated : 08:07 est , 22 may 2012 @entity1 has beaten arch - rival @entity2 to the top of the rankings for a second year running , pulling ahead across a variety of new tables			1
this has been attributed to a decline in job prospects for @entity2 graduates , with the recession having a major affect on the rankings			1
the blow comes despite the fact that @entity2 handed good degrees to 91 per cent of honours students last year and @entity1 87 per cent			1
strong performance : @entity19 at @entity1 , which has exerted its dominance for a second year running at the other end of the list , just 44 per cent of @entity22 graduates achieved a 2:1 or above			2
there are various league tables for @entity28 universities - helping students pick an institution by ranking them for subject , student satisfaction , teaching , research and other categories for the whole of the year ahead			0
over 62 key subjects , @entity1 takes top place in 30 of the 46 it offers , and is in the top ten for all 46			1
@entity2 is in the leading 10 universities for all 32 of its subjects , and is placed first in 12			2
entry requirements are being toughened up to reflect the dominance of the ancient university , with the average student accepted to @entity1 now having the equivalent of almost five a grades			2
but @entity49 from the @entity50 of @entity51 warned prospective students that league tables should not be looked at on their own when working out if a university is for you			0
' it gives you some sort of broad guidance , but if you are an undergraduate - for example - you will just be interested in the university 's score for teaching , not research , which is also included in the rankings			0
' there are a range of things you need to do , including going to look at the university			0
' last month 's tables from by the @entity69 showed the @entity70 pushing @entity2 into third place			1
this was put down to the fact that @entity70 concentrates on a narrower range of subjects , and bucked the recession by increasing graduate employment rates			2
it was the first time in the 15 - year history of the tables @entity2 has been beaten by the @entity70 , although it has previously been beaten in the table by @entity82 - in 1999 and 2000 , when it again took third place			2
however , @entity2 has taken top spot in the tables more times than @entity1 over the past decade			1
the @entity70 is in the top ten for all 12 key subjects it offers and is top for three			1
dr @entity89 , principal author of the @entity69 , said rises and falls in the rankings were driven to a considerable extent by the recession			0
recession - hit : @entity2 's slip has been blamed on student job prospects declining steeply in the financial crisis he suggested employers who typically recruit @entity103 graduates may be struggling , affecting their employment rates			1
' the employment market for graduates remains challenging and this is reflected in the rankings			0
some universities have been more successful than others in adapting to the new conditions , ' he said			0
@entity1 has also come top in the 2013 @entity114 league table for the second year running , while @entity2 came second and the @entity70 climbed a place to third			1
@entity116 , rated third last year , is now in fourth place , while @entity118 rose a place to fifth			0
@entity120 ( @entity120 ) , @entity121 , @entity122 , @entity123 and @entity124 make up the top 10			0
universities are ranked according to spending per student ; their student / staff ratio ; graduate career prospects ; what grades applicants need ; a value - added score that compares students ' entry qualifications with their final degree results ; and how happy final - year students are with their courses , based on the annual @entity138 .			0

@entity1 takes top place in 30 of the 46 key subjects it offers
