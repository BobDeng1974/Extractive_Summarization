the story of a man building a giant wooden boat to help his family and the entire animal kingdom survive a terrifying flood is one of the more contentious parts of the @entity8			0
but research by physics students suggests that a structure on the scale of @entity13 as described in the ancient text could have been built			1
and what 's more , they say it would have been buoyant even with two of every animal on @entity20 on board			0
however , while the ark would have stayed afloat they 're not sure if every animal would have fit inside			0
a group of fourth year master 's students from the @entity28 at the @entity29 calculated that @entity13 , built to accommodate at least two of every animal species , would have floated using the dimensions ordained in the @entity8 in the book of @entity34 , chapter 6:13 - 22 , @entity13 is commanded to build an ark to survive a flood			1
- the dimensions for the ark were provided in cubits in the @entity8 , an archaic measure based on the distance between the elbow and the tip of the middle finger			0
- @entity13 was commanded to make the boat out of ‘ gopher wood ’ and in order to calculate the weight of the empty ark they needed to know the density of the material the boat was constructed out of , but there is no modern - day equivalent of gopher wood			2
- @entity56 refer to cypress wood instead , so this was the material that the students used			0
- in order to calculate the overall downward force of the ark , the students needed to know the mass of the animals on board ; previous research has suggested that the average mass of an animal is approximately equal to that of one sheep , 23.47kg , which was the figure used			2
- ' our conclusions were that the ark would support the weight of 2.15 million sheep without sinking and that should be enough to support all of the species that were around at the time			1
' @entity13 was provided with exact dimensions for the boat which should be 300 cubits long , 50 cubits wide and 30 cubits high			0
it was built to hold @entity13 , his family , and at least two of every species of animal for the duration of the flood			2
using these dimensions and suitable approximations , @entity29 physics students @entity90 , @entity92 , @entity93 and @entity94 tested the instructions and were surprised with their results			1
student @entity94 , 22 , from @entity100 , said : ' you do n’t think of the @entity8 necessarily as a scientifically accurate source of information , so i guess we were quite surprised when we discovered it would work			0
' we ’re not proving that it ’s true , but the concept would definitely work			1
' the students based their calculations on a book by dr @entity94 and dr @entity112 called @entity113 , which suggested that @entity13 would have needed to save approximately 35,000 species to repopulate @entity20			1
this enabled the students to conclude that the dimensions given in the @entity8 would have allowed @entity13 to build an ark that would float with all of the animals on board			2
they added that it was a separate matter whether all of the animals would fit inside an ark of these dimensions – the physics students were simply calculating the buoyancy of the ark. the students estimated the ark could have held 2.15 million sheep , which was more than strong enough to carry two of every species @entity133 stars in the 2014 film @entity13 that tackles this biblical tale the students presented their findings in a paper for the @entity139 , a peer - reviewed student journal run by the @entity29 ’s @entity28			1
the student - run journal is designed to give students practical experience of writing , editing , publishing and reviewing scientific papers			0
course tutor , dr @entity149 , a lecturer in the @entity29 ’s @entity28 , said : ' the aim of the module is for the students to learn about peer review and scientific publishing			1
' the students are encouraged to be imaginative with their topics , and find ways to apply basic physics to the weird , the wonderful and the everyday			0

*university* of @entity29 students looked into the physics of @entity13
calculated would have been strong enough to carry two of each species
@entity13 could have held equivalent of 2.15 million sheep without sinking
' we ’re not proving that it ’s true , but the concept would definitely work , ' they added
