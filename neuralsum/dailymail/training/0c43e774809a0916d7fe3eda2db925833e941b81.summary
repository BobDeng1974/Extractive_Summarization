by @entity0 they have a coach for everything in @entity4 – and gorgeous @entity5 is a healthy eating coach who has become a good friend			1
but she ’s no @entity8 - style self - punisher – @entity5 loves to cook and eat			1
her philosophy is : getting healthy and losing weight without giving up your life			1
she ’s the one who taught me to make the perfect kale salad by ‘ massaging ’ the raw leaves with avocado			1
health coach @entity5 shares her tips on how to eat right , stop cravings and maintain a healthy , happy diet next month she launches a free online coaching series , the @entity22			1
i asked her to share some of her tried - and - tested wisdom			1
can you sum up your attitude to a healthy diet in one sentence ? it ’s not what you eat some of the time that makes you healthy , it ’s what you eat most of the time			1
what are a couple of your healthy store cupboard staples ? coconut oil – it soothes your digestive tract , keeps your metabolism revved , and keeps you full			1
i add cinnamon to everything			1
it ’s a great natural sweetener , helps satisfy sugar cravings , balances your blood sugar and contains fibre			2
you drink quite a lot of tea too , do n’t you ? herbal tea , yes			2
@entity51 and nettle help with digestion , @entity50 mate gives me energy and @entity55 clears my mind			1
but mainly , tea can be a good way of beating cravings			2
should it be five - a - day , seven - a-day			1
or even ten - a - day ? i tell clients to eat greens until they ’re coming out of their ears			1
salad wisdom : @entity5 ' taught @entity0 how to make the perfect kale salad by ' massaging ' the raw leaves with avocado i started having a kale smoothie for breakfast thanks to you ! that ’s perfect			1
but mix it up , try everything green			2
what ’s your food nemesis and how do you avoid eating it ? peanut butter			2
i will literally fall into the jar , spoon first , and come out days later			2
if i end up there it ’s because something else in my life is off balance			2
our cravings are gateways telling us something else is wrong			2
i mostly keep it out of the house			0
what are the most common problems you help clients with ? usually they want to lose weight , and they ’re trying to make better decisions but they ’re still confused			0
what ’s your one tip for eating healthily even when too busy ? master the simple act of			0
chewing ! it gives your digestive system time to register that you have eaten			0
no pain no gain : @entity110 reportedly enjoyed a @entity112 massage on holiday @entity114 and @entity115 were famously fans of a nice firm massage – on the table of fitness guru @entity119			1
now it seems @entity110 is getting in on the act , reportedly ‘ indulging ’ in @entity112 massage while on holiday in @entity124 over @entity125			0
i put the word indulging in inverted commas because this @entity130 type of body manipulation , which works on the same principal as acupuncture and reflexology , involves lots of pinching , pulling , and pain			1
it can be used to treat everything from general stress to digestive problems and even migraine			0
you do feel fabulous afterwards – but it is far from relaxing			0
the trend for being a weekday vegan might sound daft in a ‘ what is the point ? ’ kind of way			0
but i was interested to hear that former @entity151 president @entity150 , who famously gave up eating meat or animal - derived produce completely in a bid to improve his cardiovascular health , has started eating fish again on the advice of his doctor , @entity158			1
i ’ve met @entity158 and he sums up his philosophy : ‘ it ’s hard being a vegan to eat enough good , quality protein and [ easy ] to have too much starch , ’ he said			0
‘ i know a lot of fat vegans			0
’ i was interested to read that in a recent poll , 42 per cent of @entity151 workers had left a job due to an excessively stressful environment			0
meanwhile 61 per cent of @entity50 workers believe that work stress has been a cause of illness for them			0
in a lot of cases , the office environment itself can be to blame – and i for one know that since leaving my job to work for myself , i feel ten times healthier			0
not least , it got me away from the office feeders , who loved to crack open the chocolate biscuits at 4pm every day on the dot			0
here 's a fitness fashion must - buy ! i recently travelled @entity186 to visit friends and family in @entity189 and came across @entity190 , a new fitness label based near @entity192			1
i definitely took a bit of time out from my usual exercise routine while i was away , but the brilliant leggings , worn by a model on the left , have inspired me to get back in the gym pronto			0
check out the styles at @entity201			0
