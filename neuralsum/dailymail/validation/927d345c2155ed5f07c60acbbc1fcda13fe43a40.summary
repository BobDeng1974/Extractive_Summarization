a bungling @entity1 military officer mistakenly disclosed ' military secrets ' during a media briefing last month when he accidentally blurted out the expected timing for an @entity6 - led ground offensive in the city of @entity8			1
the briefer , whose presentation for reporters at the @entity13 on february 19 was authorized by @entity14 , said the @entity1 wanted the @entity6 to launch the offensive in april or may , although he also said it might go later			1
' that clearly was neither accurate information nor , had it been accurate , would have been information that should be blurted out to the press , ' defense secretary @entity17 told the @entity22			1
' so it 's wrong on both scores			0
it has been widely known for months that the offensive is in the planning stages and that it would likely mark a decisive moment in the campaign to dislodge the @entity38 from @entity6			1
@entity38 fighters overran @entity8 last june			2
@entity6 government forces folded quickly , leading to the start of a @entity1 - led bombing campaign in @entity6 in august			1
army gen. @entity43 , chairman of the @entity44 , who was testifying alongside @entity17 , said he had discussed the @entity8 briefing with gen. @entity47 , head of @entity14			1
' he 's conducting an internal inquiry , ' @entity43 said , adding that he is confident @entity49 will ' take the appropriate action			0
' he did not say what that might be			0
the briefing was done by an officer at @entity14 headquarters in @entity56 , @entity57			0
he spoke by phone to a group of reporters in the @entity13 on condition of anonymity under ground rules set by @entity14			0
fighters from the @entity38 group parade in a commandeered @entity6 security forces armored vehicle down a main road at the northern city of @entity8 : an offensive is now expected to begin later this year with @entity6 's security forces requiring more time for @entity1 - organized training the episode is remarkable in at least two respects			1
it was unusual for the @entity1 military to disclose in advance the expected timing of an offensive as well as details about the makeup of the @entity6 force that would undertake it			1
and it was curious that a secretary of defense would wait nearly two weeks after such a briefing to denounce it publicly for having spilled military secrets			2
asked about it by reporters twice last weekend , @entity17 was more circumspect			2
' the important thing is that it will get done when it can be done successfully , ' he said last friday , referring to the @entity8 offensive			2
' and even if i knew exactly when that was going to be , i would n't tell you			0
' asked to comment again the following day , @entity17 said it 's important to keep the public informed , ' consistent with security and other considerations			1
' on tuesday he was more pointed and expansive in directly criticizing @entity14			0
' it is important that we be open as a department — not with military secrets and not with war plans , which was the mistake made in this case — but we do try to keep the country informed of what we 're doing , ' he said			0
' it 's about protecting them			0
and so , openness is important but it has to have limits when it comes to security matters , and those limits obviously were n't respected in this case			0
