by @entity0 @entity2 's successful experiment of playing without a designated striker will continue this year and although coach @entity4 does not rule out other approaches he has told his players to get used to the new system			1
former international midfielder @entity4 returned to coach @entity2 after their @entity9 debacle and led them to a 1 - 0 win over @entity12 on tuesday , four days after they overcame @entity14 by the same scoreline in his first match in charge			1
he introduced a floating attack with @entity19 and @entity21 striker @entity20 changing positions up front and was pleased with the way they responded			1
it 's staying that way : @entity4 , @entity2 's manager , says the false no 9 is here for good after taking over it worked ! @entity4 introduced a floating attack with @entity19 and @entity21 striker @entity20 up top ' we are going to keep observing players and keep watching those that played , ' @entity4 told reporters after the game in @entity38 in the @entity39			1
' players need to play more to gain confidence and to feel more sure of themselves			0
' this was the first time @entity2 has played without an attacking reference point and that is very difficult			1
so we need to talk to them , the players ' movements need to be synchronised , there needs to be someone in the area when we are going forward			0
' we tried to put in more players who were quick and agile but who have no defined position except when we do n't have the ball			0
and we 'll keep working on that , we 'll test a few different ways of playing so that when we begin next year things will be much clearer			0
' he 's back : @entity19 returned to the action for @entity2 and played the full 90 minutes against @entity12 floating : @entity20 is to remain in his role of freedom in @entity2 's attack , insists new manager @entity4 although they qualified for the semi-finals - where they were hammered 7 - 1 by @entity68 - they rarely shone			1
@entity4 called up 10 players who were at the @entity9 to his first squad and his revolution , if it can be called that , looks more likely to be about tactics than personnel			2
he praised the new boys - @entity76 and @entity77 made their debuts against @entity12 - and promised continuity for next month 's friendlies against @entity81 and @entity82			2
' we played two good teams and when we were up against it the side grew in stature , ' @entity4 said			0
' the team that wants to win has to know how to suffer , they need to be humble enough to run and to take advantage when they 're on top			0
i think what was positive was the way that each of the players took their chance			0
' @entity4 led @entity2 in the @entity98 but was fired after they were eliminated at the quarter - final stage by the @entity101			2
his first competitive matches this time around will come in next year 's @entity103 in @entity104			0
better : @entity4 won the match 1 - 0 against @entity12 as @entity2 rebuild their confidence after a bad @entity9			1

@entity2 successfully tried playing without a designated striker and beat @entity12 1 - 0 after *shambolic* @entity9 on their home *ground*
@entity4 , @entity2 's manager , introduced a floating attack with @entity19 and @entity21 striker @entity20 changing positions up front
' this was the first time @entity2 has played without an attacking reference point and that is very difficult . so we need to talk to them , ' says @entity4
