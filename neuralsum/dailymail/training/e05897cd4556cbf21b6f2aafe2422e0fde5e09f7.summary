by @entity0 , @entity1 ' expect the unexpected ' : that is the advice security experts have handed out to the @entity5 authorities ahead of the @entity6			1
the tournament begins on june 12 and the @entity9 nation is bracing itself to deal with the threat of terrorism , hooliganism , violent protests and muggings			1
an estimated 600,000 foreign nationals are expected to arrive between june and july for the month - long football extravaganza , and that has provided a raft of extra concerns to security forces			1
threat : there are serious terrorist fears in @entity6 stadia , like the @entity25 in @entity26 ( pictured ) terrorism : @entity29 insurgents ( left ) tarnished the @entity30 , leading to armed guards ( right ) disaster : security forces fear a repeat of the bombings that struck the @entity36 in @entity5 the first and perhaps most important issue is that of the threat of terrorism			1
@entity40 in the past have escaped being the target of terrorist attacks but the @entity44 - at @entity36 and @entity30 - have shown that major sporting tournaments are susceptible to this threat			2
foreign visitors will also need to be protected from the widely publicised epidemic of muggings that has been sweeping through @entity5 cities			2
it will take just one high - profile serious crime for the whole tournament to be tarnished			0
theft : favelas in @entity5 , like this one in @entity57 , are notorious for muggings and visitors could be susceptible security services are already expecting a repeat of last year 's public protests which targeted the @entity63 - but this time they will likely be on a much larger and more embarrassing scale			1
add to that the violent clashes that have occurred in recent months between police and gangs in the favelas , and @entity5 's police and army will have to show total restraint			2
the eyes of the world will be watching them for any evidence of over-reaction or brutality			0
danger : stars like @entity5 @entity80 ( left ) and @entity82 's @entity81 will need protecting from terrorism finally , the so - called ' @entity85 disease ' of hooliganism is a very real threat - but it is unlikely to be an @entity85 - related problem this time			2
experts believe organised hooligan gangs from @entity92 may travel to @entity5 and clash with local fans , who have something of a reputation themselves			2
there have even been warnings that @entity92 gangs may target @entity85 supporters due to ill feeling over the @entity101			1
from @entity85 , a team of six uniformed officers will travel to @entity5 to give advice and be present at matches			0
@entity5 authorities will also make 2,377 @entity85 fans with football banning orders surrender their passports			1
protest : violent clashes have taken place in @entity112 ( above ) and other @entity5 cities just before the @entity6 discontent : @entity116 's decision to host the tournament in a nation with huge poverty has caused resentment police presence : armed security forces will be at the @entity6 , like they have been in @entity112 during protests @entity5 announced in february it would boost the number of security officers from 100,000 to 170,000 , across the 12 host cities , with the armed forces also on standby			1
of these , 20,000 will be stewards trained to work inside the 12 stadiums			0
the @entity129 has been heavily involved in planning to deal with the terrorism threat , with input from the @entity133 and the @entity134			0
there will be counter-terrorism units stationed near each venue while two unmanned drones , bought from @entity139 , will patrol the skies			0
dr @entity141 , a security expert specialising in the impact of crime and terrorism on the tourism industry , said on www.elsevier.com : ' @entity5 has traditionally never been a place of terrorism			0
' with the coming of the @entity6 , however , international problems now land on @entity5 's doorstep			0
' this means that @entity5 has not only to deal with a high crime rate but also the potential for an act of terrorism			0

@entity5 authorities expect 600,000 foreign nationals during tournament
will boost security forces from 100,000 to 170,000 across the 12 host cities
likely to be a repeat of violent mass public protests of last few months
