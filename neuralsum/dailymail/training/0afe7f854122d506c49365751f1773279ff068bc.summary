by @entity0 published : 04:47 est , 2 may 2013 updated : 06:19 est , 2 may 2013 a council has been accused of ordering @entity4 ' spy ' cars to hit minimum targets for issuing penalty notices - despite the practice being illegal			1
the alleged policy , carried out on behalf of @entity9 in north @entity10 , was revealed in a series of leaked emails			1
they showed the council 's @entity4 cars were told to issue at least 260 fines a day - a total of 87,360 a year			1
the council has denied imposing a quota for fines			1
tickets : @entity9 in north @entity10 has been accused of setting targets for the number of tickets handed out by parking inspectors ( file picture ) furious community leaders and traders in the @entity30 area of the borough have called the policy ' immoral ' and claim @entity4 patrol cars are simply a ' money - making exercise ' for the @entity36 - run authority			1
emails sent between the council 's parking manager and supervisors show that combined targets set for parking tickets issued by @entity4 cars and wardens across @entity9 in 2008 was 121,632			1
the messages were sent on april 10 , 2008 , just 10 days after the government issued guidelines warning that parking fine quota systems were illegal			2
chairman of the @entity50 , @entity51 , said : ' nobody should ever impose targets - that 's appalling			2
it 's not some kind of profit - driven business			2
they should never use fines and penalties to raise money			0
it 's immoral and unethical			0
' @entity64 : the emails were allegedly sent ten days after the government made it illegal to set targets for parking tickets ( file picture ) the leaked email from april 2008 said : ' the ( @entity4 cars ) target for the year is 87,360			1
we are confident that we can achieve this target given that we are taking on new operators , return of a @entity4 manager and the new cameras coming online			2
' the emails also show that local parking wardens were given a minimum target of issuing 362 parking tickets a day across the team			0
another email to supervisors dated may 7 , 2010 , said staff were not performing to the ' average expectation ' and threatens staff dismissal or a conduct hearing if improvements were not made			0
immoral : traders in the @entity30 area of the borough say the council 's cctv cars are simply used to make money @entity98 , owner of @entity99 , feared he would have to close his shop after his supplier was repeatedly fined as they tried to make deliveries			1
' they were ticketed three times in one week and landed with a bill of £ 330 after being targeted by a @entity4 smart car , run by external parking contractor on @entity109			1
' i 'm not surprised about this - it 's just a money - generating exercise , ' he said , ' we have to pay rates of £ 925 a month and we need to have the meat in to sell , so it 's a total paradox			0
i 'm just one guy trying to make a living			0
' a council spokeswoman said : ' @entity9 does not set targets for parking penalties , and it is inaccurate to claim that we do			1
' in fact , the email from 2010 clearly states that there is not a target for @entity128 ( penalty charge notices )			0
the email from 2008 is now five years old			0
' we did not set targets for @entity128 after legislation was changed in 2008			0
in the case of this email , which was sent just 10 days after legislation was changed , the officer incorrectly used the term ' targets ' to refer to forecasts for the anticipated number of @entity128 for the following year			2
' she added that the forecasts are ' common practice ' and designed to ' give an overview of workload for the coming year , rather than as any measure of staff performance			0
