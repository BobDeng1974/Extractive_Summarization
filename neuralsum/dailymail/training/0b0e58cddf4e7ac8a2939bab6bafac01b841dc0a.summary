by @entity0 and @entity1 this is the mafia don who will be allowed to return to his life of hiding in @entity5 after a blunder by prosecutors seeking his extradition to @entity10			1
@entity11 , who had covered his face with a scarf when arriving and leaving court , was pictured yesterday during the last , farcical stages of his legal battle			1
@entity11 was told in court that he would not have to face justice at home because prosecutors had missed the deadline to appeal against a decision to allow him to stay in @entity5 – by a matter of hours			1
in @entity10 , he had been sentenced in his absence to seven years in jail for running @entity47 , a branch of the @entity49 mafia involved in extortion , racketeering and drug trafficking			1
last week a judge ruled that he could not be sent back after a @entity55 ruling was upheld in the @entity56 , saying that chronic overcrowding in @entity10 jails breaches human rights laws			1
however , senior district judge @entity60 invited prosecutors to appeal			2
long - running case : @entity11 and his wife report at @entity64 in @entity43 on march 18 but yesterday , the 65 - year - old was told that he would face no further proceedings			1
@entity34 magistrates heard that the @entity38 had lodged an appeal at the @entity56			1
but they failed to serve papers to @entity11 ’s solicitors until tuesday afternoon – just 14 hours after the seven - day deadline			2
the @entity56 will formally dismiss the appeal within days , while prosecutors have already withdrawn the claim			0
yesterday district judge @entity75 said : ‘ there is an agreement there are no future proceedings against you			0
you ’re free to go as far as this court is concerned			0
’ free man : @entity11 , 65 , is pictured again with his wife @entity83 ( left ) and in an archived police mugshot ( right ) he granted @entity11 unconditional bail , pending the formal dismissal of the appeal			1
his decision came after chaotic scenes in which prosecutors failed to show for the hearing			0
afterwards the father - of - two wandered outside court with his 60 - year - old @entity94 wife @entity83 shaking his head saying : ‘ i am confused			0
i do not have to sign any papers ? ’ his wife insisted : ‘ my husband really has n’t done anything wrong			0
he ’s not what he ’s been portrayed as			0
@entity101 : the home of @entity11 , who lived incognito in @entity44 , west @entity43 , using the name @entity105 ‘ i ’m just happy he ’s home			2
he can go out and look after his front garden now without worrying he is being watched			0
’ since 1994 @entity11 has been hiding from @entity10 police , living in a bungalow in @entity44 under the name @entity105			1
he was arrested last august by @entity112 , and claimed to have come to the @entity5 to give his wife and their children @entity114 and @entity117 , now 36 and 33 respectively , ‘ a good life ’			2
he had been sentenced to jail in @entity10 in 1999			2
@entity11 ’s solicitor @entity120 said : ‘ this case has been a farce			0
’ a @entity38 spokeman said : ‘ the appeal against the decision of the district judge has been withdrawn as we did not serve notice of the appeal on the defence			0
