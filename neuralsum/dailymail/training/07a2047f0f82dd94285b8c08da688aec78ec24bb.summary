by @entity0 quitting @entity1 , ditching ' unsuitable ' friends and buying a dog have been hailed as the best ways to save an ailing relationship			1
a poll of 2,000 @entity7 found it often takes much more than a hug and a kiss to patch up a partnership after a nasty bust - up or rocky patch			1
the study discovered ditching social media , where the constant gaze of friends and family adds pressure , was among the most important steps			1
ditching ' unsuitable friends ( left ) and getting a dog ( right ) have been voted key ways to save a romance cutting off contact with friends who have the potential to lead us astray was also hailed as crucial , as was buying a dog , which gives couples something in common to look after			1
making more time for each other , talking honestly about issues and heading off on a romantic break together are also most likely to mend a relationship , according to the report			1
' the study found simply have more quality time together is the most successful way to save a relationship , with more than eight in ten of those who have tried this saying it made things better			1
getting off social media sites like @entity1 removes the relationship from outside scrutiny and can help save it making time for some old - fashioned date nights is also likely to result in a happy ending , with 78 per cent of couples who gave this a go getting over their rough patch			1
heading off on a ' make - or - break ' holiday together and being more honest and open with each other during important conversations was also hailed a success by more than three quarters of the couples who tried them			2
we took each other for granted 3			0
we stopped having sex 5			1
we never saw each other 6			0
we stopped any form of affection whatsoever 9			2
infidelity / one person cheating 10			0
we should never have got together in the first place other things which can help a couple survive a rough patch include ending bad or unhelpful friendships , making more effort to spice things up in the bedroom and finding a new hobby or interest to do together			0
counselling sessions , moving house and writing down the reasons you fell in love with your partner in the first place are also on the list			0
the study also found that no longer communicating is the most common reason for relationships to start falling apart , following by taking each other for granted and having to deal with money worries			1
a dwindling sex life , being too busy to spend together and simply growing apart are also to blame for a large number of relationship break - downs			2
it also emerged that @entity7 think couples should try to make things work for an average of just under 12 months before they finally call it quits on a relationship			1
but three quarters reckon people give up too easily on relationships nowadays ; with another eight in ten believe older generations were more likely to stay together because they believe marriage was for life			1
@entity108 , @entity109 at @entity110 , said : ' most relationships will go through a rocky period at some stage , and it seems the way you deal with things during that time can be the difference between patching things up or splitting permanently			0
' the secret seems to be spending more time together rather than separating your lives even further than they already are			0
simple things like making time for each other in busy schedules can also help a relationship in crisis ' many relationships go through a difficult period when day - to - day life gets in the way or you become too busy or stressed to simply enjoy some quality time together			2
' as a consequence , you can lose the intimacy and closeness that relationships need to survive			0
' so things like going away on holiday together , making more time for date nights and even just having honest conversations are often all it takes for couples to get their relationship back on track			1
he added : ' couples should think long and hard before giving up on a marriage			0
it can have long term financial and emotional consequences for both themselves and any children involved			0
' there are organisations which can assist couples in saving a relationship but if it has irretrievably broken down , communication is still key to ensuring that the divorce or separation is as smooth as possible			2
' relationship breakdowns do n't have to be acrimonious but if they are , it 's likely the couple will face a costly legal battle			2
' the single family court will be introduced in april this year and under the new scheme all couples are required to attend mediation before issuing proceedings			0
there are exceptions but most cases will not fall into these exceptions			0
' following the removal of legal aid for most family cases in april 2013 , the government hope this new approach will encourage a ' friendlier ' approach with better communication and earlier settlements			0

cutting contact with friends who lead you astray *deemed* crucial
getting a dog and arranging date nights also ways to save relationship
many now think @entity7 give up too easily when romance gets tough
' we stopped communicating ' top reason for relationship to end
