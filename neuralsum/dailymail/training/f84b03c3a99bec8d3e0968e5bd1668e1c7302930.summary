by @entity0 unhealthy modern lifestyles are n’t the only cause of heart disease , say scientists , who have found clogged arteries in @entity7 mummies			1
scans of 4,000 - year - old mummies have revealed evidence of hardening of the arteries – a condition which can lead to heart attacks and strokes			2
earlier studies had revealed fatty arteries in a large number of @entity7 mummies but critics had dismissed the find as related to their luxurious , fatty diets			1
until now it had been widely assumed that today 's high rates of heart and artery disease were chiefly the result of unhealthy modern lifestyles			2
it is though that diets rich in saturated fat encourage the deposit of fatty layers on artery walls which harden over time			2
as a result blood vessels become narrower and the flow of blood is impeded			0
when insufficient blood reaches the heart muscle or brain it can trigger a heart attack or stroke			2
‘ atherosclerosis is supposed to be a disease of modern civilisation , ’ dr @entity54 , a nuclear cardiologist at @entity57 ’s @entity56 told @entity58 of @entity59			1
‘ it 's supposed to be explained by the fact that we 're eating all the wrong foods , not exercising enough , becoming obese and having diabetes			0
‘ and a lot of people have said that if we could just go back to the way our ancestors were living we could even lose this problem , ’ he added			2
in a previous study , scientists looked for evidence of heart disease by taking an x-ray of the mummified remains of @entity80 who lived in the third intermediate period ( 1070 - 712 bc ) an @entity7 princess who lived more than 3,500 years ago is the oldest known person to have had clogged arteries , dispelling the myth that heart disease is a product of modern society			1
dr @entity54 and colleagues made the discovery in 2011 when they found the @entity7 princess @entity91 , who lived in @entity94 between 1540 and 1550 b.c. , had calcium deposits in two main coronary arteries			1
the princess ' father and brother were both pharaohs			0
the mummy had pierced ears and a large incision in her left side made by embalmers to remove her internal organs			0
dr @entity54 doubted she would have received much treatment beyond maybe taking special herbs or honey			0
' if she were my patient today , she would get open heart surgery , ' he said			0
he added the princess ' clogged arteries looked remarkably similar to heart disease in contemporary @entity7			1
dr @entity54 and his colleagues presented their findings at the recently concluded @entity118 annual meeting , in @entity119			0
the group had previously found identified hardening of the arteries in 16 mummies at the @entity7 national museum of antiquities in @entity57			1
of these , nine showed evidence of atherosclerosis - build - up of fatty materials such as cholesterol , in blood vessels			0
but the group decided to expand their initial study to include naturally mummified specimens from other societies and economic backgrounds			0
samples were gathered from @entity136 , @entity137 ; from the @entity139 people in @entity140 ; from @entity141 in @entity142 ; and from people in @entity144			0
dr @entity54 said he wanted to respond to any criticism that mummies of @entity7 only represented a rich elite , who would have eaten more fatty foods			1
the scientists scanned 76 mummies from around the world and arterial disease was found in around 38 per cent of them , with the average age of death estimated at 37			1
the team also scanned 178 @entity57 cancer patients , aged from 14 to 48 , and found that 61 per cent of them had arterial hardening			1
‘ there was no difference between the mummies and patients in terms of atherosclerosis incidence or severity , ’ dr @entity54 said			0
‘ they were nearly equivalent ’			0
dr @entity54 added that heart disease risk is not just about poor diet and obesity , but that genetics may also come into play			1
a second @entity173 reconstruction from an earlier study shows a mummy from 200 - 900 ad of a @entity137 woman in her 40s , excavated from @entity178 , near @entity136 , with calcifications in the arteries last year , ct scans of 137 mummies showed evidence of atherosclerosis , or hardened arteries , in one third of those examined - including those from ancient people believed to have healthy lifestyles			2
' heart disease has been stalking mankind for over 4,000 years all over the globe , ' said dr @entity193 , a cardiologist at @entity195 's @entity194 in @entity196 and the 2013 paper 's lead author			1
dr @entity193 said he was surprised to see hardened arteries even in people like the ancient @entity139 who were presumed to have a healthy lifestyle as hunter - gatherers			0
' i think it 's fair to say people should feel less guilty about getting heart disease in modern times , ' he said			1
' we may have oversold the idea that a healthy lifestyle can completely eliminate your risk .			0

study *suggests* heart disease risk is not just about poor diet and obesity
it is a follow up to previous *research* by @entity56 that *suggested* ancient @entity7 had heart disease *due* to a fatty , luxurious diet
study looked at mummies from different areas and *socioeconomic* groups
arterial disease was found in around 38 per cent of them , with the average age of death estimated at 37
