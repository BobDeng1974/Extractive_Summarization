by @entity0 published : 13:18 est , 11 october 2013 updated : 13:18 est , 11 october 2013 two teenage @entity2 boys banned from school and put in ' isolation ' because they would not shave off their beards will be allowed to return to school unshaven			1
@entity7 , in @entity8 , @entity9 , had said the two 14 - year - olds were in breach of the dress code , which bans beards as well as false nails , fake tan , make - up , dyed hair and inappropriate jewellery			1
but today the school was forced to reverse their controversial decision as it did not comply with the @entity21			1
governors have now ruled that only @entity2 boys have permission to grow a beard as a sign of their faith - as long as they are devout and practising			1
last week the boys were sent home after a month in isolation			1
despite their parents ' claims that the punishment was a form of discrimination , headteacher @entity31 claimed it was not a religious matter			1
two @entity2 students have been banned from lessons at @entity7 , in @entity9 , for breaching the dress code by refusing to shave off their beards last week , the school said its own research concluded they are not required by the @entity45 to wear beards , and it is therefore a personal choice to do so			1
around a third of the 750 pupils at @entity50 are from ethnic minorities , mostly @entity52 , according to the 2012 @entity54 report			2
a relative of one of the boys said last week : ' because these boys can not shave their beards for religious reasons , they are being put in isolation for six - and - a - half hours every day			1
' they are not being allowed to mix with anybody or speak to friends			0
' they chose that school because it is within their area and has good results			2
the school has to have an open policy and they have to take in people from all religions			2
' she said the youngsters were put in a room on their own and made to study without the rest of their classmates			0
she also said their parents sent the school a letter of complaint explaining they could not shave as their beards were symbols of their faith			1
the letter was later retracted to allow for talks between the families , teachers and the @entity92 , the relative said			0
mr @entity31 said the rule had been in place for a while , but had been strictly enforced from the beginning of the new term , after letters explaining there would be no exceptions were sent out			0
' because these boys can not shave their beards for religious reasons , they are being put in isolation for six - and - a - half hours every day			1
they are not being allowed to mix with anybody or speak to friends			0
it is pure discrimination ' - a relative of one of the boys he said : ' the rule in school is that all boys have to be clean shaven			1
' having said that , there were two year 11 boys last year who had grown a beard and because it was months or weeks before their gcse exams , i spoke to the two boys , who explained that on religious grounds , they wanted to keep their beards			1
' i felt it was an unfair pressure to bear on them and i agreed to an exception			0
' on the back of that , i made arrangements to speak to a number of other @entity132 boys who were also sporting beards to make them aware there would not be any further exceptions and , when they came back after the summer , they were expected to be clean - shaven			1
' children who turn up to school with red hair , inappropriate jewellery , false tan or make - up are isolated in a room until the matter is addressed and then they return to their normal day			1
' these boys were given the option to do that and chose not to			2
' tonight , in a statement the school said : ' governors at @entity50 have decided that there will be no change to the school rule which requires boys to be clean shaven			1
' however , following discussions with leaders of the local community , exemptions will be made in certain clearly - defined circumstances			0
the school has said the pupils are breaching the dress code , which bans beards as well as false nails , fake tan , make - up , dyed hair and inappropriate jewellery ( file picture ) ' as a voluntary aided catholic school , governors are the employers and legitimately set their own rules regarding uniform and appearance			1
' the rule regarding boys being clean shaven is reasonable and proportional and has been in place for some time			2
all parents and children are fully aware and accepting of school rules			2
' the rule is part of the school standards agenda along with hair style , hair colour , jewellery and make up ensuring high expectations for all pupils and that their appearance is standardised			1
' the school is advised that it is part of @entity2 tradition and religious belief that a beard is a sign of commitment to the @entity203 faith but it is ultimately down to personal belief			1
' in line with @entity208 human rights legislation , governors have taken the decision to only allow @entity2 boys permission to grow a beard as a sign of their faith ' - statement from @entity50 tonight ' having said all that as governors of voluntary aided schools we have to comply to the @entity21 , as do all schools			1
' as part of this legislation all schools must make reasonable adjustments to school uniform on genuine religious grounds			2
' the bishop of @entity227 ’s advice has been for governors of @entity50 to work with the local @entity203 leaders to support boys who are genuinely and fully committed to their faith			1
' with this in mind , and in line with @entity236 legislation , governors have taken the decision to only allow @entity2 boys permission to grow a beard as a sign of their faith as long as they have started the @entity242 programme at their local mosques			2
' @entity244 is an extensive programme that involves attending @entity246 for 2 - 3 hours a day to pray and learn the @entity45 word by word in @entity249			0
' welcoming the decision , county councillor @entity250 said : ' i ’m very glad that we are moving in the right direction and i ’d like to thank the headteacher and governors for their understanding and co-operation			0
' @entity259 is an excellent school in our local community - we have always supported it and will continue to do so			2
' understandably , this has aroused some interest , but we hope we can continue the dialogue and address the issues as they arise			0
' regards this issue , we hope the school can continue the important job of providing excellent education to its students			0
' the issue of whether beards are compulsory for devout @entity2 is open to interpretation , according to professor @entity273 , of the @entity274 at the @entity275			0
growing debate : last month @entity277 weighed in on the debate about religious dress code in schools he said the @entity281 was believed to have had a beard and that men insisting on doing the same claimed they were emulating his actions			1
mr @entity31 said the issue was not one of religion , but of upholding school rules			2
he said : ' we have not taken this decision lightly			0
i have spent quite a lot of time researching the issue and speaking to @entity2 elders			0
' there is nothing specifically written in the @entity45 about wearing a beard			0
it is a choice those boys are making			0
however inclusive we are , we have standards to maintain			0
' chairman of governors @entity301 said : ' the decision to uphold the rule was made by governors and it is a rule for everybody			0
' @entity307 , chairman of the @entity92 , said : ' the headteacher is co-operating and the school wants to learn about the issue and address them appropriately			0
' different people have different variations of understanding			0
' some are newly interacting with the @entity2 community and it is our duty not to put people in awkward positions			0
' last month the prime minister indicated he would support guidelines to judges , teachers and immigration officers telling them when @entity2 women can be asked to remove their veils .			0
