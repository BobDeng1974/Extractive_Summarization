by @entity0 published : 07:29 est , 31 october 2012 updated : 08:50 est , 31 october 2012 these three young with the infamous reverend @entity1 are the teenage exorcists who claim they can rid you of your demons - and they did just that to a woman named @entity7			1
@entity9 and his assistants , daughter @entity8 , 18 , and her two friends , sisters @entity12 , 17 , and @entity14 , 20 , collectively banish peoples tortured souls			0
@entity7 believed a @entity18 demon named ' @entity19 ' was haunting her before the girls ' exorcism in @entity22			1
demon destroyers : reverend @entity1 with daughter @entity8 ( centre ) and @entity27 ( left ) and @entity12 ( right ) @entity14 get out : @entity7 had the @entity18 demon ' @entity19 ' removed from her soul the trio met in karate class where they all excelled in self - defence , training to black belt standard			1
but since then the girls , who also enjoy horseback riding and shopping , have exercised demons in over one hundred rituals since training at @entity41 of @entity42			1
@entity1 said : ' i train the girls how to spot the difference between mental illness and possession			2
' they learn some of the basic factors			0
if someone has been diagnosed with a mental illness we do n't do an exorcism			2
' based on my experience , probably half the population of @entity55 is possessed			0
also , based on things like rates of abuse , drugs , and anti-social behaviour			0
in action : the girls treat @entity7 for her malaise ( and below ) watchful : @entity7 's partner @entity66 sees the team in action ' we are a very desperate , morally bankrupt culture and that 's where demons operate			1
' @entity7 , who did not wish to provide her surname , was undergoing her third exorcism in @entity76			1
she believes ' @entity19 , ' among other demons , was inside her tortured soul			1
the girls set to work in a conference room , calling out the demon alongside @entity82			1
they chanted for it to ' go to the pit of hell ' and with one final call @entity7 vomited into a bucket			1
amazingly , at the end of it all , @entity7 requested one more thing - to marry her partner @entity66 there and then			1
after she retreated quickly to change into her white dress , @entity9 - a veteran of some 15,000 exorcisms around the world - happily fulfilled the unusual request			0
from agony to ecstasy : @entity7 puts on the wedding ring given to her by husband @entity66 ( below ) you may kiss the bride : the pair took the unusual step of getting married right after the exorcism @entity8 said : ' we worked with her ( @entity7 ) and got her demons drawn out and now she 's all cleaned up			1
' she 's a great example of what can be done with deliverance			0
the exorcism with @entity7 was one of the most incredible that we had done in a long time			1
it was very dramatic and violent			1
but we had it under control			0
' ' it was very intense , ' added @entity27			0
' the demon was very stubborn			2
we had to keep going			0
then we ended with a wedding			0
that was a memorable night ! it had such a beautiful ending			0
' the master : @entity9 gets involved with the event chilling out : the girls , who also like horseback riding and shopping , eat frozen yoghurt @entity1 was very happy with how it all turned out , and with the girls ' performance			2
' they did an excellent job , ' he says			0
' they handled it with dignity and boldness , even though this was very violent			2
there were times where i had to step in , but they were doing things that very few priests would do			0
' they are very brave girls			2
they got up close with the demon			2
this is very unusual for teenage girls to do something like this			0
' he added : ' i believe the girls ' work in exorcism has prevented many people from entering into a destructive life and they should be seen as a great asset to society			1

@entity7 was haunted by a @entity18 demon named ' @entity19 ' among others
the girls chanted for the demon to ' go into the pit of hell ' in a ' dramatic and violent ' exorcism
