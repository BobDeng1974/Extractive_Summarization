by @entity0 and @entity1 fuming @entity2 has urged people to ' get over ' the @entity5 ' outcast ' @entity7 's notorious racist rants - insisting : ' i think political correctness is c * * p '			1
the @entity13 star says @entity7 is ' all right , ' despite the actor 's previous use of anti-semitic and racist epithets - claiming : ' we all hide and try to be so politically correct			1
that 's what gets me			0
' speaking in an explosive new interview with @entity22 , the 56 - year - old comes to the defence of both @entity7 and @entity24 as he said people are ' hypocrites ' for not forgiving the pair 's transgressions			1
' i think it 's like , take a f * * * ing joke			1
' @entity7 , 58 , made @entity47 slurs when he was arrested for suspected drink - driving in @entity49 in 2006 , two years after his film @entity50 was criticised for depicting @entity51 negatively			1
according to the police report , @entity7 made anti-semitic remarks to the arresting officer , saying : ' f * * * * * * @entity51 ... the @entity51 are responsible for all the wars in the world			1
' he has since apologised for his ' despicable ' behavior , explaining that the comments were ' blurted out in a moment of insanity '			2
and in the wide - ranging interview in @entity22 's july / august double issue out on friday that covers @entity2 's ' wild nights ' with groupies and his four marriages , the actor - whose new movie @entity13 is out next month - says : ' i do n't know about @entity7			1
he got drunk and said a few things , but we 've all said those things			0
' we 're all f * * * ing hypocrites			1
that 's what i think about it			0
' the policeman who arrested him has never used the word n * * * * * or that f * * * ing @entity51 ? ' i 'm being brutally honest here			1
it 's the hypocrisy of it that drives me crazy			0
' or maybe i should just strike that and say " the @entity84 " and " the @entity85 , " although there are two @entity88 words now			0
' ' he 's alright ' : @entity2 claimed ' everyone ' has used racial slurs like @entity7 and should forgive him @entity7 returned to the headlines in 2010 accused of battery of his then - partner @entity95 , following the release of an audio recording where the actor apparently threatened to wrap a bat around his ex-girlfriend 's head , used racist slurs and appeared to admit to having punched her twice			1
his friend @entity2 , who has also starred in @entity105 , also backed ' good guy ' @entity24 , despite his past homophobic remarks			1
he said : ' @entity24 calling someone an @entity109 in the street while he 's pissed off coming out of his building because they wo n't leave him alone			0
i do n't blame him			0
' @entity7 is in a town that ’s run by @entity51 and he said the wrong thing because he ’s actually bitten the hand that i guess has fed him - and does n’t need to feed him anymore because he ’s got enough dough			1
' he ’s like an outcast , a leper , you know ? ' but some @entity51 guy in his office somewhere has n’t turned and said , “ that f * * * ing kraut ” or “ f * * * those @entity126 , ” whatever it is ? we all hide and try to be so politically correct			1
that 's what gets me			0
' notorious : @entity7 has been an @entity5 outcast since his infamous drink - driving arrest in @entity49 in 2006 ' we all hide and try to be so politically correct			2
that ’s what gets me			2
it ’s just the sheer hypocrisy of everyone , that we all stand on this thing going , “ is n’t that shocking ? ” ' after then jokingly saying , ' f * * * the @entity141 , ' the @entity143 actor admitted the interview had taken a fateful turn , and insisted he was not ' a bigot			1
' working class @entity2 , who is the son of a welder , said : ' no , but i ’m defending all the wrong people			1
i ’m saying @entity7 ’s all right , @entity24 ’s a good guy			1
' good guy ' : the @entity152 star said he understands why @entity24 has used homophobic slurs in the past ' so how do i come across ? angry ? it ’s dishonesty that frustrates me most			1
' i ca n’t bear double standards			2
it gets under my skin more than anything			0
' he then claimed certain comedians are allowed to say racist and homophobic things under the guise of satire , while he would get slammed			0
the father - of - three claimed : ' well , if i called ( minority leader of the @entity166 ) @entity167 a c * * * — and i ’ll go one better , a f * * * ing useless c * * — i ca n’t really say that			1
foul - mouthed : @entity2 also controversially said @entity172 is ' a c * * * ' and said ' f * * * the @entity141 ' ' but @entity174 and @entity175 can , and nobody ’s going to stop them from working because of it			1
' @entity174 could call someone a fag and get away with it			0
he said to @entity182 this year , “ i thought you were going to do the @entity184 again			2
instead they got a lesbian			0
” ' he can say something like that			2
is that more or less offensive than @entity24 saying to someone in the street , “ you fag ” ? i do n’t get it			1
' the actor , who only ever received one @entity184 nomination despite a career of acclaimed turns , took a bitter swipe at the way members of the @entity201 vote - as he also called the @entity202 a ' meaningless event '			0
@entity2 was finally nominated for a best actor in 2011 for @entity205 , but lost out to @entity207 's @entity206			2
he said : ' at the @entity184 , if you did n’t vote for 12 years a slave you were a racist			2
disappointment : he was finally nominated for a best actor in 2011 for @entity205 but lost out ' you have to be very careful about what you say			0
i do have particular views and opinions that most of this town does n’t share , but it ’s not like i ’m a fascist or a racist			2
there ’s nothing like that in my history			2
' the @entity223 born star , who now lives in @entity224 with fourth wife @entity225 , insisted he was a libertarian in his political views , and added , ' you do n’t come out and talk about these things , for obvious reasons			2
' and he claimed his independent nature and his refusal to work on the political side of fame had cost him the movie world 's most prestigious prize			0
he said : ' what people do n’t realize is that you need to work at being a celebrity			0
' i ’m not talking about movies			0
i mean the other side of it			0
' you have to campaign			0
it ’s a whole other part of your career , and i wish i could have navigated it a bit better			0
' i may have an @entity184 now , had i. '			0

@entity249 star @entity2 says ' we 're all f * * * ing hypocrites '
' @entity7 is in a town that ’s run by @entity51 and he said the wrong thing because he ’s actually bitten the hand that i guess has fed him '
' but some @entity51 guy in his office somewhere has n’t turned and said , “ that f * * * ing kraut ” or “ f * * k those @entity126 , ” whatever it is ?
