@entity9 has also alleged that a second 17 - year - old boy recorded the january 2012 incident in the small northwest @entity13 town of @entity14 using cellphone video			1
today 's announcement is a victory for @entity18 , @entity4 's mother , who said she is looking forward to answering questions in a new review of the case			1
victory for @entity4 ? @entity9 has accused @entity14 , @entity13 teens @entity23 , 19 , and @entity24 of raping her when she was 14 in january 2012 , and now a special prosecutor has been appointed in to re-investigate the case @entity29 prosecutor @entity28 will re-investigate the rape allegations made by @entity4 @entity18 told @entity31 that she and her daughter just want to be heard and to have the case looked at ' fairly , and with some enthusiasm			1
' ' we were disappointed that they did n't really do the job			0
they did n't really collect the evidence , and they did n't seem to care from the beginning			0
anything above that would just be extra , ' she said			0
the case has drawn international attention to the town after a seven - month investigation published last week by the @entity49 raised questions about the transparency of the process			1
felony charges against both boys were dropped last year after @entity56 prosecutor @entity55 said @entity4 and her family stopped cooperating with the investigation			1
a claim denied by @entity4 's mom			1
the newspaper 's story described a town where many appeared to be closing ranks around the accused and blaming the girl			2
in the wake of the fresh scrutiny , @entity55 asked for a special prosecutor to be appointed and it was announced on monday that @entity29 prosecutor @entity28 had accepted the high profile case			1
reopened : charges against @entity23 , left , and @entity24 will be revisited , but news of the circumstances under which they were dropped in march 2012 has the town of @entity14 , @entity13 taking sides and has the public eager for justice in the case of @entity4 's rape accusations ' your son is going to get a bullet through his head ' : the @entity87 restaurant in town has become the focus of threats from hacktivist group @entity91 , though the owners are n't associated with the accused rapists she has promised to review the case ' without fear and without favor			1
' ' i can also assure you that politics , connections or any other reason you can think of will not play a role in our review of this case			2
it will be the evidence , as it is in every case that we review , ' @entity28 said			1
residents of @entity14 claim they ’re now besieged by threats and in - fighting thanks to the attention that the case has had in the past week			1
townspeople fear they ’re being cast as villains as the case of the new girl in town who accused two popular teens of rape - only to have the charges suddenly dropped - which is now being reopened			1
as the residents are forced to choose sides , news viewers across the country eager to create their own justice have even begun to threaten people related to the case using phone calls and the internet			2
@entity23 , now 19 , and @entity24 , were accused by then 14 - year - old @entity4 of rape after she and a friend went drinking with the boys in january 2012			1
in the months after the case was dropped because of an apparent lack of evidence , @entity4 ’s mother @entity18 has been on a quest to get justice for her daughter			1
' the media have made us look like a bunch of scum ' : national media scrutiny has many residents , even those who have n't chosen a side in the case , seething			1
it 's done a disservice to @entity14 , ' said @entity149 , 83 opening up : @entity150 , seen here with her mother , was with @entity4 on the night of the alleged rape			1
she said that the ordeal was ' very scary ' she and her family were new in town , and @entity23 ’s family had local political connections that some believed helped him and his buddy get off scot - free despite @entity4 ’s allegations she was given a ‘ clear liquid ’ that left her incapacitated before she was raped			1
and it all came to a head after the @entity49 published the @entity9 ’s story last weekend and @entity4 ’s story appeared on just about every internet news outlet			1
many residents say it put them in an unfair light			0
‘ the worst thing to my wife and me is that we have this wonderful little town here and you ( the media ) have made us look like a bunch of scum , ’ 83 - year - old @entity149 told this @entity49			1
‘ it ’s done a disservice to @entity14 , a disservice to our legal system			2
’ the case has lit a fire under so called online ‘ hacktivist ’ group @entity91 , who ’ve made threats to physically harm some residents and to destroy their property and livelihood			1
scrutiny : @entity4 , at right with her mom @entity193 , has graced covers and homepages of major media since news of her saga went national last weekend			1
the town of @entity14 has also become the focus of intense scrutiny , much to its chagrin dig deep : @entity202 , left , is the mother of @entity23 , 19 , one of the high school footballers accused of raping @entity4			1
she called on everybody to ' dig deeper to find the truth ' around the case and said her son is the real victim in the case threats on her son 's safety pour into the tiny town ' we 're hurting			2
it 's explosive ' : the home @entity4 shared with her family was mysteriously burned after they left town			1
a threat to torch the @entity219 has since come from a @entity224 @entity223 user the owners of the @entity87 @entity227 restaurant in town say they get threatening phone calls every day , and though their son was attended the party where @entity4 claims to have been assaulted , he was not implicated in the crime			2
‘ we got a phone call last night : “ your son is going to get a bullet through his head , ” ’ one of the owners said saturday			0
their business ’s @entity242 review page has been hit by @entity91 , too			2
‘ so generous ! ’ read such post before administrators removed it			0
‘ even once you ’re stuffed , they keep bringing you food — almost like it ’s against your will ! when i told them to stop , they smiled and reassured me that i was asking for it			0
’ in a statement , @entity91 expressed their outright support of @entity4			2
' we demand an immediate investigation into the handling by local authorities of ( the victim ’s ) case			0
if @entity14 wo n’t defend these young girls , if the police are too cowardly or corrupt to do their jobs , if the justice system has abandoned them , then we will have to stand for them			2
mayor @entity268 , your hands are dirty			0
' rumors : all parties involved with the alleged sexual assault attended @entity219			0
rumors now abound about bomb threats being called into the school and its football field second chances : though she and her family have fled @entity283 , wedged in the center of the ongoing saga is @entity4			0
her case , according to county prosecutors , will now be revisited @entity56 prosecuting attorney @entity286 , who says neither politics nor connections played a role in his decision not to pursue the charges , has asked for a special prosecutor to reopen the felony case			0
meanwhile , threats and division within the towns own ranks continue			0
resident @entity298 , 46 , fears what her 11 - year - old daughter could be exposed to in the town			2
‘ i did n’t want her to even possibly hear anything about the girl being wrong , ’ she told the @entity49			0
‘ her house was burned down			0
she had to leave town			0
’ indeed , the home where @entity4 lived with her family was mysteriously burned after the family fled town			2
perhaps to make a statement about the fire , a @entity223 user in @entity224 posted declared he would burn down the high school			0
murmuring about bomb threats have also fluttered through town , though they are unfounded			0
@entity23 ’s mother @entity202 , who has staunchly defended her son , has called on the public leave the townspeople alone			0
' there are universities in the state with children from @entity14 and they are having to be walked to class because of threats made over the internet , threats that are being made to them			2
it ’s getting worse and worse , ’ @entity23 told @entity332 last week			0
former school superintendent @entity333 said opinions of his town are worsening , too			0
‘ it makes @entity14 , to people at a distance across the land , look like a community that does n’t care about the individual			0
