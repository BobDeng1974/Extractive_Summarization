by @entity0 published : 19:46 est , 30 january 2013 updated : 20:44 est , 30 january 2013 @entity1 made a joke that the @entity3 could lose the next election as the man charged with delivering a @entity7 victory at the next election , @entity1 is supposed to be a cheerleader for @entity7 triumph in 2015			1
but the chancellor has revealed his inner doubts about the prospects of victory to the rest of the @entity15			0
the @entity16 has learned that mr @entity1 surprised his fellow ministers recently by cracking a doom - laden joke predicting that the party will soon be in opposition			1
mr @entity1 ’s comment came as @entity7 chairman @entity22 outlined ways the @entity7 can maximise their vote by reaching out to black and other ethnic minority voters at the next election			1
one minister urged mr @entity27 to act promptly on the plans , saying : ‘ we do n’t want to be sitting around the @entity15 table having this conversation in three years ’ time			1
’ at that point mr @entity1 piped up : ‘ in three years ’ time we will be sitting around the shadow cabinet table			1
’ those present said the chancellor was ‘ only half joking ’ when he made the crack and that he provoked ‘ nervous laughter ’ from other ministers			0
mr @entity1 ’s gallows humour was particularly stark coming from the man who is charged with devising the conservative election strategy and reviving @entity42 ’s economic fortunes			1
and observers expressed surprise that the chancellor chose to make his gloomy comment at a meeting expressly designed to boost the @entity3 ’ prospects of boosting their vote share in 2015			2
one of those present said : ‘ @entity1 just said it quick as a flash			2
there was a bit of a stunned pause while everyone realised what he meant and then a lot of nervous laughter			0
everyone knows we might lose but to hear it from @entity1 himself is not exactly reassuring			2
’ another source said : ‘ it was an odd moment to make that joke since we were talking about how we win , not how we lose			0
’ a spokesman for mr @entity1 denied that he is pessimistic about the @entity3 ’ chances of success : ‘ @entity1 thinks we can and will win the next election			1
’ but he did not deny that the comment was made			0
details of the chancellor ’s mordant joke emerged as @entity3 said they will seek ‘ revenge ’ for the @entity73 voting down reform of constituency boundaries , which would have given the @entity3 a 20 seat boost at the next election			2
chancellor of the exchequer @entity1 made the grim joke at a meeting to discuss ways of boosting @entity7 election chances thanks to the @entity83 bias , the @entity3 will now need a national poll lead of around 7 per cent to secure a majority			1
under plans being discussed by senior conservatives , more @entity73 seats would be added to the @entity7 hitlist of target seats			0
@entity7 donors will be asked to contribute with the specific intention of ousting particular @entity93			0
mr @entity22 has drawn up a list of 40 seats the @entity3 need to win a healthy majority - 20 of which are @entity73 seats			2
but a well - placed source said : ‘ the talk now is that we increase that to 30 or 35			0
it ’s pretty hard getting donors to cough up to run photocopiers at @entity104 [ @entity7 hq ] but they would be more than happy to fund a campaign to oust some more of these b * * * * * * s. ’ @entity108 joked that the @entity109 has become like a family gathering with relatives who have outstayed their welcome @entity108 , the communities secretary , has said that the coalition is like an extended family that has spent too much time together			2
it was like @entity116 , he said			0
‘ you have been as nice as you can to your relatives , but by the time @entity116 comes around you realise why you do not live together			0
’ @entity7 mps in target seats will be told they must attend ethnic minority events in order to boost their chances of victory			0
before mr @entity1 ’s joke , ministers had heard how being non-white is the single biggest reason why people do n’t vote @entity7 - more important than class or wealth or home town			1
they then discussed plans for @entity27 to make a speech distancing the @entity3 from the toxic legacy of @entity135 , whose ‘ @entity139 ’ speech about immigration in the 1960s is still seen as proof the party is racist by some ethnic minority voters			0
mr @entity27 has brought in @entity144 election expert @entity143 to run the campaign			2
but strategy will still be set by himself and mr @entity1 , who divides his time at the @entity149 with political strategy meetings in @entity151			1
labour leader @entity152 regularly taunts mr @entity1 as ‘ the part time chancellor ’ for his dual political and economic role			1
but a growing number of @entity7 mps are also losing patience with mr @entity1 amid concerns that the flatlining of the economy will cost them any prospect of victory in 2015			1
one senior backbencher said yesterday : ‘ people are getting nervous that the time on the economic clock is beginning to run out			0

a meeting was held to discuss ways to boost votes at the next election
mr @entity1 joked they would soon be sitting at the shadow cabinet table
