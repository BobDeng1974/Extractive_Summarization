by @entity0 published : 06:51 est , 15 march 2013 updated : 06:55 est , 15 march 2013 two gay bars are embroiled in a bitter courtroom battle over the right to be ' queer '			0
@entity5 , the music promoter who formed @entity6 in 1990 , is suing the owners of a recently - launched venue in @entity9 called ' queer street ' in the @entity10			1
he claims they are exploiting the reputation of @entity13 , a bar and club on @entity16 in @entity18 's @entity17 , which he has owned through companies since it opened in 2003			1
copycat ? gay venue @entity21 opened in september in @entity9 suing : mr @entity5 has owned @entity13 , a popular venue on @entity18 's @entity16 , since 2003 mr @entity5 contacted his lawyers in september last year , when @entity25 , a company headed by the director of @entity28 , @entity29 , opened ‘ @entity21 ’ , in @entity30 , @entity9			1
the music mogul was complaining about the use of the word ' queer ' by the new bar			0
in a @entity10 writ issued by @entity37 , barrister , @entity39 , says the venue ' has accrued goodwill in its business which has become exclusively denoted by the word " @entity13 " '			2
he argues that as much as £ 60,000 - a - month has been spent on fortifying the bar ’s reputation by advertising in the gay press and magazines since it opened			2
mr @entity39 claims the ' exclusive goodwill ' attached to the word ' queer ' ' extends nationally ' , is the property of the @entity18 bar and @entity21 is causing public confusion			1
not happy : music promoter , @entity5 , who formed @entity6 , right , feels his @entity18 bar has accrued ' goodwill ' since it opened in 2003 which his @entity9 rival is exploiting the former boyband manager is demanding an injunction requiring the ' obliteration ' of the word ' queer ' from ' all articles and premises ' in connection with the @entity9 bar , along with damages and legal costs			1
the barrister added that @entity13 ’s goodwill could be ' tarnished and diluted ' unless its @entity9 rival is forced to change its name			2
@entity72 , for the owners of @entity21 , disputes that @entity13 ’s goodwill exends across the @entity75 and says in his clients ’ defence : ' it is denied that the @entity21 name and logo give rise to a likelihood of deception in the minds of the relevant public			2
' the only element common to the name and logo of both bars is the word @entity13			0
both bars are directed towards the gay community			0
the word @entity13 is commonly and colloquially understood as describing someone who is gay , thus queer in these circumstances has a descriptive meaning			1
' references to queer bars or nightclubs would be understood by members of the relevant public to be a reference to a bar or nightclub that was directed to members of the gay and lesbian community			0
' it is admitted that a bar has traded in @entity18 under and by reference to the name queer for several years			0
it is admitted that the bar has acquired a reputation and goodwill in the gay community in and around @entity18			1
it is denied that any such goodwill extends throughout the @entity75			0
' if the claimant is the owner of the alleged goodwill , it had only limited value , ' concludes mr @entity72 .			0

@entity5 , who formed @entity6 , suing @entity21 , @entity9
says they are exploiting reputation of @entity13 , his venue in @entity18
claims he has gained ' exclusive goodwill ' since bar opened 10 years *ago*
@entity21 lawyers say word has ' descriptive meaning ' in gay community
