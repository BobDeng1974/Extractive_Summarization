by @entity0 follow @ @ neilashton _ in 2009 , former @entity2 chief executive @entity1 sat alone in the stands to watch @entity4 play for @entity5 against @entity6			1
‘ just watching him play then , i knew he would go on to play for @entity5 at the highest level , ’ recalled @entity1 yesterday as he spoke of the best £ 500,000 he ever spent , to sign @entity4 from @entity7			1
@entity2 ’s academy director @entity10 and chief scout @entity12 had been to watch him play for the youth team at @entity14			2
they were convinced they had found something special and @entity1 agreed			2
have faith , @entity19 : @entity20 should select @entity4 from the start against @entity22 backdrop : @entity4 pings one in front of the stunning scenery surrounding @entity5 's training base nearly five years on , @entity5 have discovered a star before a ball has even been kicked at the @entity28 in @entity29			1
@entity4 ( below ) has to play on saturday against @entity22			1
those who have watched him train or play , either in @entity31 last week or here at the @entity33 military base yesterday , walk away with the same verdict			0
there is room for him at @entity37 in this @entity5 team if @entity39 moves out to the left and @entity41 plays on the right against @entity22			1
@entity43 — reliable yet unremarkable — would be sacrificed			0
@entity39 , whose finishing was of the highest order in training yesterday , provides experience and @entity41 adds security on the right in place of @entity49			0
@entity20 has to make this happen			2
@entity4 , 19 , is one of a dying breed — comfortable when running at defenders at high speed			1
the @entity2 forward enjoys it , too			0
this was evident yesterday when his twinkle - toed moves took him past his team - mates on a glorious day here in @entity59			0
even @entity49 has been marvelling at @entity4 ’s ability since they joined up for the @entity28			1
‘ he ’s a great athlete and the more we see of him on the pitch the better it is for the country , ’ said @entity49 yesterday			2
‘ it is great that he has taken his club form into the national set - up , but there are a lot of talented players in various positions			0
‘ @entity39 played out wide the other day and @entity41 can play there			0
there is a lot of competition and that is healthy			0
’ @entity78 : @entity79 , @entity4 and @entity80 posing for photos during a portrait session smiles : @entity4 and @entity84 take part in a recovery session after training on monday it is too soon to be talking of @entity4 and @entity80 starting in the same team at the @entity28			1
@entity80 is another who wants to make things happen , but there is too much temptation to play fast and loose when he is in possession			2
he will be better coming from the bench			0
@entity4 ’s star continues to rise and he was mesmerising during the intervals in the various drill sessions being put on by @entity20 during yesterday ’s open training session			1
he was full of tricks , flicks and turns , with his mastery of the ball something to behold			0
he is a joy to watch			0
the @entity2 forward has no fear and that is something @entity5 must capitalise on in tournament conditions			1
there is also the obvious issue of trust , particularly when you factor in his age , lack of international experience and his dismissal against @entity119 at the @entity120 last wednesday			2
his rash challenge on @entity122 was a mistake , but he showed maturity after the @entity126 winger grabbed him by the throat during that fiery exchange			2
@entity20 is convinced he has learned			0
fracas : @entity4 was sent off against @entity119 after a confrontation with @entity122 team - mates : @entity4 and @entity132 provided plenty of superb moments for @entity2 this season @entity4 ’s game has benefited from an extended run in the @entity2 side this season alongside the @entity140 player of the year @entity139 and his @entity5 team - mate @entity132			1
he has come a long way since the early phase of his @entity2 career , when he was one of three hugely - talented young @entity146 players signed by @entity1 around the same time			0
@entity147 , who arrived from @entity148 , moved on last season and signed for @entity150 after failing to become a regular fixture in the @entity2 set - up			0
@entity153 , who was a @entity154 under 17 international when he arrived from @entity14 , has returned back north of the border to @entity156			0
@entity4 has made the grade , though , forcing his way into the first team at @entity2 and forcing @entity20 to make a decision when he travels to @entity161			1
he has only made two starts for his country , but he is the man in form as the countdown continues to @entity5 ’s opening group game			1
on saturday evening , @entity4 can make the difference .			1

@entity4 can make the difference from the start against @entity22
the *teenager* was *suspended* for @entity5 's final warm up game
sent off against @entity119 after confrontation with @entity122
just two starts so far for his country , but he has the talent to step up
