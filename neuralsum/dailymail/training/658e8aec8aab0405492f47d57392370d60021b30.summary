by @entity0 published : 16:20 est , 17 june 2013 updated : 01:23 est , 18 june 2013 a robot which can run like a cat at speeds of up to 3mph has been developed by researchers			1
scientists at the @entity6 in @entity7 , @entity8 , have modelled their design on the animal , with springs replacing tendons and small motors used in place of the muscles			1
the four - legged ‘ cheetah - cub robot ’ - billed by its developers as small , light and fast - is said to be the fastest of all robots its size and can run nearly seven times its body length in one second			1
‘ we 've developed it for very fast locomotion , ’ researcher @entity52 said			0
‘ in this case , we 've mimicked a lot of the morphology of a house cat			0
‘ eventually the goal is to have a robot which is easy to use - very robust , very fast and very dynamically running - kind of naturally running			2
he added : ‘ this morphology gives the robot the mechanical properties from which cats benefit - that ’s to say a marked running ability and elasticity in the right spots , to ensure stability			2
’ creation : developer @entity52 said the robot has been producerd ' for very fast locomotion ' technical : scientists at the @entity6 in @entity7 , @entity8 , have modelled their design on the animal , with springs replacing tendons and small motors used in place of the muscles on the ground : researchers hope that the robot will one day be useful for search and rescue efforts in areas with difficult terrain flexible knees also help the robot to get over small obstacles such as steps			1
the researchers hope that the robot will one day be useful for search and rescue efforts in areas with difficult terrain			0
' eventually the goal is to have a robot which is easy to use - very robust , very fast and very dynamically running - kind of naturally running ' @entity52 , researcher @entity96 , director of the @entity8 institute ’s @entity97 , said the invention is still in its experimental stages - but researchers hope it will precede other more developed devices			2
‘ the long - term goal of the cheetah - cub robot is to be able to develop fast , agile , ground - hugging machines for use in exploration , for example for search and rescue in natural disaster situations			0
‘ studying and using the principles of the animal kingdom to develop new solutions for use in robots is the essence of our research			0
