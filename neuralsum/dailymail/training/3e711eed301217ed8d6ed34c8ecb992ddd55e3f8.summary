by @entity0 published : 20:04 est , 12 december 2012 updated : 09:35 est , 13 december 2012 with its low - flying helicopters slipping under the radar into @entity4 and special forces commandos leaping into the dark compound below , last year ’s stunning operation to kill @entity8 was a boy ’s @entity10 drama that had old - fashioned machismo written all over it			1
the reality of @entity16 ’s battle against terrorism , it seemed , could n’t have been more different to the glamorised , politically - correct fiction of @entity19 , the hit tv show in which @entity21 plays a beautiful @entity23 agent who spots the @entity25 plot which her misguided male colleagues have missed			1
the world ’s most dangerous terror group foiled by a killer blonde in @entity30 who wars with her superiors ? only in @entity35 ’s dreams , surely			0
according to @entity40 , a forthcoming film about the hunt for @entity8 — whose makers were given top - level access to those involved — he might never have been found if it had n’t been for an attractive young female @entity23 agent every bit as troublesome as @entity19 ’s @entity57			1
@entity23 insiders have confirmed claims by the film ’s director @entity60 that she is entirely justified in focusing on the role played by a junior female @entity23 analyst , named @entity65 in the film and played by @entity39			1
and just as in @entity19 , the real agent has been snubbed by superiors and fallen out with colleagues since the @entity8 raid in may last year			1
but who is this @entity23 supersleuth ? although the woman is still undercover and has never been identified , @entity40 ’s emphasis on @entity65 ’s importance tallies with the account of a @entity42 involved in the raid who later wrote about it in a book			1
@entity8 hunt : a very different side of the agent was seen days after @entity8 's body was brought back			1
she even started crying @entity85 writes in @entity85 of flying out to @entity86 before the raid with a @entity23 analyst he called ‘ @entity90 ’ who was ‘ wicked smart , kind of feisty ’ and liked to wear expensive high heels			1
she had devoted the best part of a decade to finding @entity8 and had become the @entity42 ’ go - to expert on intelligence matters about their target , he said			1
and while her colleagues were only 60 per cent sure their quarry was in the compound in @entity102 , she told the seal she was 100 per cent certain			2
‘ i ca n’t give her enough credit , i mean , she , in my opinion , she kind of teed up this whole thing , ’ @entity104 said later			0
the commando saw a very different side of her days later when they brought @entity8 ’s body back to their @entity86 hangar			1
having previously told @entity104 she did n’t want to see the body , ‘ @entity90 ’ stayed at the back of the crowd as they unzipped the terrorist ’s body bag			2
she ‘ looked pale and stressed ’ and started crying			0
‘ a couple of the @entity42 put their arms around her and walked her over to the edge of the group to look at the body , ’ wrote @entity104			0
‘ she did n’t say anything			0
with tears rolling down her cheeks , i could tell it was taking a while for @entity90 to process			0
she ’d spent half a decade tracking this man			2
and now there he was at her feet			0
’ @entity90 ’s role in the operation passed largely unremarked when @entity104 ’s book came out but now the new film — which is released in the @entity138 in january — has confirmed his estimation of her importance			2
although she remains active as a @entity23 analyst , it is believed @entity144 , @entity60 ’s screenwriter , was allowed to interview her at length			1
it has emerged that she is in her 30s and joined the @entity23 after leaving college and before the 9/11 attacks turned @entity16 security upside down			1
on target : the agent was one of the first to advance the theory that the key to finding @entity8 lay in @entity25 's courier network which led to his compound ( pictured is the attack scene in the movie ) according to the @entity159 , she worked in the @entity23 ’s station in @entity161 , @entity4 , as a ‘ targeter ’ , a role which involves finding people to recruit as spies or to obliterate in drone attacks			1
but @entity23 insiders say she worked almost solely on finding @entity8 for a decade			1
she was still in @entity4 when the hunt heated up after @entity169 became president in 2008 and ordered a renewed effort to find him			0
according to colleagues , the female agent was one of the first to advance the theory — apparently against the views of other @entity23 staff — that the key to finding @entity8 lay in @entity25 ’s courier network			1
the agency was convinced @entity8 , who never used the phone , managed to communicate with his disparate organisation without revealing his whereabouts by passing hand - delivered messages to trusted couriers			1
the agent spent years pursuing the courier angle , and it was a hunch that proved spectacularly correct when the @entity16 uncovered a courier known as @entity187 and tracked him back to a compound in the sleepy @entity4 town of @entity102			0
fiesty : @entity39 as agent @entity65 in @entity40 about the hunt for @entity8 it was a stunning success for the dedicated agent , though she hardly endeared herself to her colleagues in the process			1
as one might expect of a woman working in the largely male world of intelligence , colleagues stress she is no shrinking violet but a prickly workaholic with a reputation for clashing with anyone — even senior intelligence chiefs — who disagreed with her			0
‘ she ’s not @entity206 , but that ’s not going to find @entity8 , ’ a former colleague told the @entity159			2
another added : ‘ do you know how many @entity23 officers are jerks ? if that was a disqualifier , the whole @entity213 would be gone			2
’ in the film , @entity65 is portrayed as a loner who has a ‘ her - against - the - world ’ attitude and pummels superiors into submission by sheer force of will			0
@entity23 colleagues say the film ’s depiction of her is spot - on			1
if this is the case , then she shows little of the feminine tenderness that serves @entity57 so well in @entity19 and which @entity35 usually uses to soften female protagonists like @entity65			0
instead , the film shows her happily colluding in the torture by waterboarding of an @entity25 suspect			1
and @entity233 reported how she had told him she was n’t in favour of storming the @entity8 compound but preferred to ‘ just push the easy button and bomb it ’			2
given that the bombing option would almost certainly have killed the women and children the @entity23 knew were inside , her comment suggests a cold indifference to ‘ civilian ’ casualties			2
but then the real female agent is hardly your archetypal film heroine			2
she has reportedly been passed over for promotion since the @entity8 raid , perhaps adding to her sense of grievance			2
although she was among a handful of @entity23 staff rewarded over the operation with the @entity255 , the agency ’s highest honour , dozens of other colleagues were given lesser gongs			1
fellow staff say this prompted her anger to boil over : she hit ‘ reply all ’ to an email announcing the awards and added her own message which — according to one — effectively said : ‘ you guys tried to obstruct me			0
only i deserve the award			0
’ although colleagues say the intense attention she received from the film - makers has made many of them jealous , they are shocked she was passed over for promotion and merely given a cash bonus for her @entity8 triumph			1
glamorised fiction : the reality of @entity16 's battle against terrorism could n't have been more different to the politically - correct hit tv show homeland , in which @entity21 plays a beautiful @entity23 agent who spots the @entity25 plot which her misguided colleagues missed she has also been moved within the @entity23 , reassigned to a new counter-terrorism role			1
@entity60 , who won an @entity288 as director of the iraq war drama @entity290 , has said it was like being dealt a @entity292 at poker when she discovered a woman at the heart of the story			0
‘ the juicy thing about @entity65 was the surprise of it , ’ she said			0
one thing is certain : the emotional cost of her achievement took its toll on her			0
@entity104 recalls seeing her again as he and his comrades got on to a plane back to their main base at @entity308 in @entity86			0
she was sitting on the floor of the plane sobbing , ‘ hugging her legs to her chest in the fetal position ’			0
her eyes were ‘ puffy and she seemed to be staring into the distance ’			0
when he tried to reassure her that the mission had been a ‘ 100 per cent ’ success , she simply nodded and started crying again			0
he put it down to a mixture of exhaustion and relief for a woman who had , with almost messianic zeal , dedicated her life to hunting down the architect of 9/11			0
