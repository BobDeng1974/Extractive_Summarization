by @entity0 published : 04:55 est , 20 august 2013 updated : 11:55 est , 20 august 2013 the @entity2 newspaper allowed @entity4 agents spies into its @entity6 offices to oversee destruction of leaked @entity9 data after the government threatened legal action			1
the newspaper 's editor @entity12 claimed in an opinion piece published on the @entity2 's website that a pair of staffers from @entity4 eavesdropping agency @entity18 monitored the hard drives being destroyed			1
shortly after his paper began publishing reports based on @entity23 's leaks , he said he was contacted by ' a very senior government official claiming to represent the views of the prime minister ' who demanded the return or destruction of @entity23 's material			2
claims : ' @entity34 ' government figures were sent in to destroy hard drives owned by the @entity2 , the newspaper 's editor has revealed mr @entity12 said dialogue with officials started around two months ago , before their ' mood toughened ' around a month ago , when he claims he ' received a phone call from the centre of government telling me : ' you 've had your fun			1
now we want the stuff back '			0
' he revealed he held a series of meetings with ' shadowy @entity51 figures ' , in which he was asked to destroy all @entity23 related material			1
eventually , he said , officials threatened legal action , and that 's when the editor allowed @entity4 agents into his basement			1
the newspaper editor said two @entity18 security experts oversaw the process in the @entity6 basement he adds that he told the official he intended to publish the material abroad , should the government seek to stifle them using legal routes , before hardware was destroyed at the newspapers basement			1
' and so one of the more bizarre moments in the @entity2 's long history occurred - with two @entity18 security experts overseeing the destruction of hard drives in the @entity2 's basement just to make sure there was nothing in the mangled bits of metal which could possibly be of any interest to passing @entity85 agents			1
" we can call off the black helicopters " joked one as we swept up the remains of a @entity89 ' the revelations come a day after @entity92 , the partner of @entity2 journalist @entity93 - who interviewed @entity94 whistle - blower @entity23 - was held and questioned at @entity95 for nine hours , under schedule 7 of the @entity97			1

' shortly after his paper began publishing reports based on @entity23 's leaks , he said he was contacted by ' a very senior government official claiming to represent the views of the prime minister ' who demanded the return or destruction of @entity23 's material mr @entity12 warns ' it may not be long before it will be impossible for journalists to have confidential sources '			1
however , he points out that the @entity2 will continue to make use of reporting from other , more ' permissive legal environments '			0
@entity12 said the destruction was the culmination of weeks of pressure on the guardian by @entity4 officials			2
it was not clear exactly when the incident occurred			0
@entity12 gave a vague timeline , suggesting that it happened within the past month or so			2
ordeal : @entity93 ( left ) walks with his partner @entity92 ( right ) through @entity151 @entity23 's leaks - published in the @entity2 , the @entity153 , and other publications - have exposed the details of the @entity94 ' global surveillance apparatus , sparking an international debate over the limits of @entity94 spying			2
and as politicians debate reforms and civil liberties group go to court , journalists have been wrestling with the implications of mass surveillance			0
