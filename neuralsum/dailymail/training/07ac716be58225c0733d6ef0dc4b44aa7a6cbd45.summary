by @entity0 published : 07:27 est , 30 july 2013 updated : 02:19 est , 31 july 2013 complaints : @entity2 , 25 , is fighting to stop her council sending gifted son @entity5 , 7 , to a special school with his photographic memory and an iq of 168 , @entity5 is top of the class			1
the eight - year - old – who taught himself to read at 18 months – has the academic ability of a child twice his age			1
but @entity5 has been told that he will have to move from his primary school to a special school because he has autism			1
despite his brilliant progress at school , the local education authority has decided it is too costly for him to have teaching assistants there			2
his mother , @entity24 , 25 , is taking legal action			1
miss @entity24 , from @entity26 in @entity27 , said : ‘ taking him out of the school he loves and putting him in a special needs school will pull the carpet from underneath him and completely ruin him			1
‘ he has surpassed everyone ’s expectations and no child deserves to be taken away from a school that is working for them			0
’ @entity35 has attended @entity36 since he started school			0
his mother first noticed her son ’s abilities when he picked up a children ’s book in a doctors ’ waiting room as an 18 - month - old toddler and read it aloud			1
experts say @entity35 has the academic ability of a 15 - year - old but he has high - functioning autism , which means he can struggle with some social situations			1
he has had a one - to - one teaching assistant at his school to help him deal with loud environments and busy classes			2
@entity55 and talented : @entity24 says he boy @entity35 has an high iq and a photographic memory , but moving him away from mainstream school will wreck his chances special : @entity35 's detailed drawings , including this one , led to him being diagnosed with autism but the local authority now wants to move him to a school for children with learning difficulties after @entity70 ’s asked for funding for a second teaching assistant			1
miss @entity24 said he was thriving at school and the decision will see his progress stall and rare talents wasted			1
happy chap : @entity35 , pictured as a baby , taught himself to read and began reading out loud at 18 months she said : ‘ what the council wants to do simply is n’t on and they would be depriving @entity35 of his opportunities			1
‘ the only reason they ’re doing this is to save money as they do n’t want to have to pay to support @entity35 as he progresses through mainstream school			0
what he ’s achieving at his current primary school is priceless			0
‘ he will not be intellectually stimulated there ( at a special school )			0
' i will be willing to back a change , but only if it is the correct one for my son			0
’ miss @entity24 has launched tribunal proceedings against @entity100 ’s decision to move him to @entity102 in @entity103			2
a @entity104 and @entity105 will decide if @entity35 should move to the special school			0
if the appeal is unsuccessful , the case can be heard in the @entity109			0
miss @entity24 has asked that if her son can not attend his local primary school that he go to a residential school for children with social , emotional and behavioural difficulties in @entity115			2
a council spokesman said : ‘ it is agreed that @entity35 requires specialist provision			2
‘ the county council has identified an independent special school in the county which can meet his needs , but his parents have not accepted this			0
home : @entity35 is @entity36 but the council want him moved elsewhere ' they have identified an alternative school , but due to its distance from his home , @entity35 would have to be a weekly boarder			0
we feel this is inappropriate for a seven - year - old [ @entity35 turned eight yesterday ]			1
‘ his parents disagree and have lodged an appeal , which they are entitled to do			0
’ @entity139 declined to comment .			0

@entity27 council say @entity5 needs specialist education
but his mother @entity24 says moving schools will wreck his rare talents
the seven - year - old has 168 iq and could read aloud at 18 - months - old
