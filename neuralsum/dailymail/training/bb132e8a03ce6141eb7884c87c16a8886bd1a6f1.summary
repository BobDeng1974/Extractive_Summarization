by @entity0 published : 05:32 est , 7 march 2013 updated : 05:11 est , 8 march 2013 many people who are reluctant to head to the gym joke they are allergic to exercise , but for one mother this is actually true			1
@entity7 , 33 , ca n't work up a sweat as an increased heart rate could spark a potentially fatal reaction			1
the mother - of - four is just one of a handful of people in the @entity14 who suffer from the condition , known as @entity16 ( @entity16 )			1
@entity7 's face swells during an allergy attack , which is usually brought on by exercise running for a bus or chasing after her kids after she 's eaten certain foods causes her face to swell and could kill her if she went into anaphylactic shock			1
mrs @entity7 , from @entity27 , @entity28 , said : ' when i get an attack , my eyes swell up and start to itch			1
within five minutes , they 're completely closed			1
it 's terrifying , especially if i 'm alone with the children			1
' i was ice skating with my husband when i had a really bad attack			1
i had to use an @entity39 to bring the swelling down			1
' people do n't believe me when i tell them i 'm allergic to exercise			1
they think it 's just an excuse to be lazy			2
but the truth is , i used to go the gym all the time			2
i was a size ten			2
' @entity7 suffered her first attack when she was in her early 20s before she fell pregnant with her first child , @entity47 , now 12			1
at first , she assumed it was an allergic to reaction to some eye shadow she 'd bought off the market			2
mrs @entity7 used to be a size 10 ( pictured aged 19 , left ) before her condition made it impossible to exercise mrs @entity7 can finally enjoy walking to her local park with her children without the fear of an attack , after being put on a new medication mrs @entity7 , who is also mother to @entity61 , eight , @entity62 , seven and three - year - old @entity63 , immediately stopped using the make - up but it took another three days for the swelling to go down			1
she said : ' one day i went to the gym with my mum			2
i just did a normal work - out then my eyes started feeling tight			2
' @entity71 said they looked funny			2
she was really worried so she took me to @entity73			2
they put a cold compress on my eyes and prescribed me antihistamines			2
' it helped but it kept happening			2
i 'd planned to walk everywhere to help lose my baby weight but i 'd walk a few hundred yards and swell up			2
' it took me years to realise that exercise was the trigger			0
' doctors had also been baffled by @entity7 's strange allergic reactions and tried her on a range of antishistamines			1
but over the year her reactions became more severe			0
@entity7 : ' i was on the bus with my children when it suddenly swerved			1
the driver slammed on his brakes and the buggy tipped up			0
' my eyes instantly swelled up			0
i had all four children with me and i did n't know what to do			0
i could n't see and @entity47 had to take us to my sister 's house			0
' every time my heart rate goes up i have an attack			1
my sex life was null and void			0
' mrs @entity7 ca n't risk going on the cross-trainer as raising her heart rate can trigger a dangerous reaction when an eye specialist could n't find anything wrong with her eyes , she was a referred to a dermatologist but he also drew a blank			1
mrs @entity7 and her husband @entity112 , 35 , a civil engineer , then travelled to @entity113 to see an expert			1
she was finally diagnosed with @entity115 ( @entity16 ) , which can be brought on by exercising after eating certain foods , as well as an underactive thyroid that is linked to the condition			1
@entity7 with her husband @entity112 and four children			1
she has joined a slimming group to try and lose extra weight through her diet she said : ' it was a relief in a way because i could put a name to it			0
i was n't going mad			0
i 'd been tested for all sorts over the years			0
i thought it could be hay fever , a blocked tear duct or sweat gland			0
' he gave me different medications			0
he told me because the condition is so rare it was exploratory			0
none of them worked though			0
' finally , thanks to a new type of antihistamine mrs @entity7 can walk to the park for the first time in ten years without having an attack			1
she said : ' i still ca n't exercise though and that does get me down			0
i joined a slimming group because i want to lose weight but it can only do so much			0
' they think it 's food related but they do n't know what food it is			0
they 've tested me for all sorts			0
if i knew what food it was i would stop eating it			0
' i 've been prescribed an @entity39 in case an attack turns into an anaphylactic shock but luckily it has n't yet			1
i know the signs now and stop what i 'm doing because i ca n't risk it			0
' @entity163 , from @entity164 said : ' some people can suffer allergic symptoms such as urticaria ( raised weals ) , rhinitis ( blocked and runny nose ) , wheezing or gastric symptoms when they exercise			1
' when it only occurs sometimes on exercise , it may be linked to eating a certain food beforehand , even though the food can be safely eaten when not followed by exercise			0
' fortunately , this is not common , but it is important to have this condition diagnosed as the reaction can cause anaphylaxis			0
