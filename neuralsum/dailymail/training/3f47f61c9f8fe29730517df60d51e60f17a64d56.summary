@entity0 has yet to discover what his short - term disciplinary future holds but is already hatching big plans for a new era of @entity6 success under his captaincy			1
@entity0 is likely to hear during the next two days whether , and if so when , he will face an @entity10 hearing over alleged racial content in his on - field spat with @entity14 's @entity13			1
he has already paid for his conduct that day at @entity16 earlier this month , serving a mandatory two - match ban which covered @entity6 's victory over @entity19 when they clinched the @entity21 title at @entity22 two weeks ago and their ' coronation ' final fixture at home to @entity26			0
@entity0 was prevented from joining @entity6 's trophy presentation due to the ongoing inquiry additionally , and controversially , he was prevented from joining @entity6 's trophy presentation in @entity29 as it emerged the @entity10 's inquiry into his altercation with @entity13 was still ongoing			1
@entity0 , and @entity6 chairman @entity33 , were not at liberty to discuss that case during a q&a session with club members in the @entity39 long room at lunch against @entity26 on tuesday			1
the half - hour set - piece was an occasionally chaotic occasion , due to a faulty microphone which interrupted @entity0 and @entity33 many times			2

@entity6 's captain was accused of using racially offensive language towards @entity14 's @entity13 more than 300 members packed the venue , and were immediately informed no questions could be answered about ' the current situation with @entity6 and the @entity10 '			1
@entity33 spoke of his pride at having come a ' hell of a long way ' with what was a ' club in crisis ' when he first began investing in @entity6 12 years ago			2
@entity33 , also an @entity10 vice-chairman , made it clear too - irrespective of the outcome of the disciplinary procedure facing the captain - he has long valued @entity0 as a pillar of @entity6 's team			1
recalling why he first decided to become involved at @entity39 , @entity33 said it was ' for people like @entity0 - because to me , that is what @entity6 cricket is all about ... '			1
together , @entity33 hopes they can help ensure there is no false dawn this time - as there was when @entity6 last won the title , in 2001			2
@entity33 said @entity6 's county success ' could be the start of an era , for the next 10 years ' ' i believe it could be the start of an era , for the next 10 years , ' @entity33 said			1
' that 's the target i 'm setting , for @entity6 to dominate - county cricket , one - day cricket			0
' i think we 've got the coaching staff , the players , the academy ... to achieve that			0
' @entity0 has the same aspirations			0
he noticed ' summat special ' about @entity6 even when they first joined up at the start of this season , determined to erase the disappointment of a late fade into runners - up spot the previous summer			0
