by @entity0 published : 04:46 est , 11 january 2013 updated : 08:14 est , 11 january 2013 when the @entity3 family decided to build a snowman as big as a house , they knew it was going to be a tall order			1
but the snow kept falling so they kept building - and watched it grow 30 feet into the sky			0
@entity3 and his three sons , @entity14 , @entity15 , and @entity16 , helped by a team of their cousins , began the mammoth task in relatives @entity21 and @entity23 's back yard , in @entity24 , @entity25 , just before @entity26			1
tall order : family members , from left , @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity23 , @entity33 , and @entity34			1
the rest of the family involved have gone back home or to college			0
the snowman is so big that he has a fridge box for a head and by @entity45 , their towering creation could be seen across the neighbourhood			1
the snowman is so big that they used a fridge box for a hat and made a giant scarf out of felt to wrap around its neck			0
but despite all that hard work , @entity3 says the real achievement was working together as a family			2
' the time we got to spend together with my dad and brothers is irreplaceable , ' @entity3 said			2
' it brought us a lot closer together and that was great			0
' it has even begun attracting local sightseers who have flocked to the snowman to take pictures			2
now that the family members have gone back home or to college , @entity21 and @entity23 still wake up each morning to see the snowman 's christmas tree decoration eyes staring back at them through their upstairs bedroom window			1
it is a permanent reminder of the magic a family @entity26 can bring			0
' it 's going to be there a long time , ' said @entity23 , smiling .			0

it was built by @entity3 and his three sons , @entity14 , @entity15 , and @entity16
they were staying with relatives @entity21 and @entity23 in @entity24 , @entity25
they began the mammoth project before @entity26 , finished for @entity45
sightseers have flocked to see the giant *sculpture* and take photographs
it has so far shown no signs of *melting* , and *gardners* say it is there to stay
