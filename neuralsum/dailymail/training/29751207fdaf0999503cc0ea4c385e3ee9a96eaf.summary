six months today voters will get the chance to hand @entity2 another five years in @entity3 – or kick him out in favour of @entity5			1
with the parties neck and neck in the polls , the election is expected to be the closest since october 1974 , when @entity11 won a tiny three seat majority over @entity13 – giving @entity14 another five years in @entity15			1
like @entity11 40 years ago , mr @entity2 is stuck just shy of being able to govern alone – 46 seats ahead of @entity14 , but 23 short of an outright commons majority			1
to get over the line , the prime minister needs to hold on to his 303 mps while winning another 23 seats just to achieve a one - seat @entity23 majority			1
mr @entity5 meanwhile needs to take just 24 seats directly off the @entity25 to make @entity14 the biggest party in the @entity23			1
if he is able to pull it off , the @entity14 leader would get the first shot at forming a @entity31 government - probably with @entity32 as his deputy prime minister			2
if he manages to take 24 seats off the conservatives while holding on to his own 257 mps , in six months mr @entity5 will be prime minister with 281 seats to the @entity25 279			1
but , with the vast majority of seats rock - solid @entity14 or @entity25 the next election will be fought in crunch marginal constituencies			2
here @entity42 reveals the @entity25 ' 25 top targets to win in six months - and @entity14 's 30 - seat wishlist to kick mr @entity2 onto the backbenches			1
@entity14 meanwhile need to win the 30 seats listed on the right to become the @entity23 largest party for @entity14 to form a majority government on their own , they need to hold on to every seat they won under @entity59 in 2010 , while winning in another 69 constituencies around the country			1
according to the latest poll for @entity63 , @entity14 have a 1 per cent lead over the @entity25 – with 33 per cent of the public backing mr @entity5 ’s party , to the @entity25 ’ 32 per cent			2
however , a separate @entity68 poll for the @entity69 suggests mr @entity5 has pulled ahead of the @entity25 – with @entity70 swaying @entity72 voters more than those of any other party			2
according to @entity68 , the @entity25 have dropped to 27 per cent compared , with @entity14 standing firm on 31 per cent			0
@entity70 is now on 24 per cent and @entity76 on 9 per cent			0
but , despite being ahead in the polls across the @entity78 , @entity14 is facing disaster in @entity80			0
recent surveys have suggested the @entity82 could win 47 seats north of the border in in may – wiping out any chance of mr @entity5 winning a majority			1
according to the @entity88 survey , @entity14 could face winning just ten seats – down from 40 today			0
the poll of 1,000 adults found 45 per cent intended to vote for the @entity82 , 28 per cent for @entity14 and 15 per cent for the @entity25			0
voters in just a few dozen seats will decide whether @entity2 remains in @entity49 , or if @entity5 becomes prime minister the crisis in @entity80 has helped spark the biggest crisis of mr @entity5 ’s leadership			1
it comes amid rising panic that his own personal unpopularity is costing @entity14 support in its traditional heartlands			0
analysis of voter satisfaction ratings over four decades reveals mr @entity5 is down to minus 34			0
it means he is less popular than any prime minister or opposition leader at this point ahead of an election , except @entity110 who led @entity14 to its worst ever defeat			0
@entity113 , @entity114 , @entity115 , @entity116 , @entity117 and @entity59 all had higher net satisfaction ratings with @entity119 six months before being hammered at the ballot box			0
since becoming leader four years ago mr @entity5 has seen a collapse in his public satisfaction ratings			2
a month after he defeated his brother for the leadership , 41 per cent per of voters were satisfied with mr @entity5 with just 19 per cent dissastified , giving a net rating of 19 points			0
in the latest @entity131 survey , published two weeks ago , the figure had slumped to -34 , twice as bad as @entity2 's -17			0
a separate @entity63 poll found 34 per cent of people think mr @entity2 would make the best prime minister from a list of the four main party leaders – twice the number who backed mr @entity5			2
some 49 per cent of @entity14 voters think the party would be more likely to win next year ’s election if @entity5 was replaced as party leader			1
