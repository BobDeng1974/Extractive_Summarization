by @entity0 @entity1 : 14:26 est , 26 december 2013 @entity2 : 16:31 est , 26 december 2013 it 's like the plot from a heart - warming family movie			2
seven months after @entity9 ’s dog @entity10 was stolen , she was found bedraggled but unharmed , 500 miles from where she ’d disappeared			1
after the show dog was kidnapped from outside her home in @entity15 , @entity16 , miss @entity12 spent months appealing on the internet to try to trace her @entity19 sheepdog			1
@entity9 ( left ) has been reunited with her dog , @entity10 , after she went missing seven months ago but she had given up all hope of ever seeing the dog again when a call came from @entity24 , saying @entity10 was safe , well and ready to come home			1
the incredible reunion took place because @entity10 had been fitted with a pet microchip containing her owner ’s details			1
rather than have @entity12 , 25 , travel all the way to @entity24 , staff at the rescue centre that were caring for @entity10 agreed to meet her in the @entity35 – at a dog show she was attending in @entity37			1
the hand - over took place around ten days later , shortly before @entity40			2
it was a moment the mother of two will never forget			0
she said : ‘ i was doing my best not to cry , but it was amazing			0
it was a massive , massive relief when i actually got my hands on her and picked her up			0
‘ i had been putting stuff on @entity49 for months , but i had given up about six weeks before that			2
i thought : that ’s it			0
i am not going to get her back now			0
‘ so it was unbelievable when i heard she had been found			0
’ the six - year - old bitch was on a lead outside her home near @entity15 , close to @entity59 in @entity60 , when thieves crept in through a broken fence and took her			0
@entity10 , whose pups sell for up to £ 800 , was next seen 521 miles away , wandering the outskirts of @entity66 , @entity24			1
she was picked up by council workers and taken to the local dog pound , where she was traced back to @entity60 through her microchip			1
miss @entity12 believes @entity10 was stolen for breeding purposes and cast aside by the thieves when the plan was n’t successful , or perhaps that she escaped from new owners who had bought her from the dognappers			1
although she was dirty when picked up and her fur was matted , @entity10 was still healthy and had been properly cared for during her seven months of captivity			1
she had even put on weight			0
‘ whoever had her did look after her			0
she ’s not nervous or scared of anything , it ’s as if she has never been away			0
she ’s back to her usual happy self			0
’ miss @entity12 , who is a trainee beautician with children aged three and five , has nine show dogs in total , including @entity10 ’s sons and brother , but it is @entity10 who has been the household ’s favourite this @entity40			2
‘ the kids were really excited to get @entity10 back			2
on the whole they love each dog equally but because of the hype of her going away and coming back it ’s @entity10 they want all the time			1
‘ they are really happy to have her back			0
’ @entity97 , a spokesman for @entity66 council , said @entity10 was taken in after being spotted by a builder in a field			2
he added : ‘ we are pleased that there was a happy outcome to this story and that @entity10 is now safe and enjoying home comforts once again			1
