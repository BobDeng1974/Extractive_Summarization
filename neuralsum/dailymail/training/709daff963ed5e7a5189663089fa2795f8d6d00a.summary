if you ’ve ever wanted to sail through the world ’s powerful ocean currents , then take a look at this			2
created by @entity7 - based @entity6 , this interactive globe shows the ocean currents in real time as they swirl around continents			1
users can drag the globe to their desired location and click on the spot they want to find out an ocean current in all its grandeur			2
a region that looks calm at first glance is seen as an active area of currents on closer inspection , using the mouse wheel to zoom in			1
fascinatingly , the globe gives viewers an insight into the five major ocean gyres , the large systems of rotating ocean currents , particularly those involved with large wind movements			0
the five - located in the @entity33 and in the north and south of the @entity36 and the @entity37 - are clearly visible and their affects can be traced throughout the world			0
created by @entity7 - based @entity6 , this globe shows the ocean currents in real time as they swirl around continents pictured here is the ocean current system close to the @entity45			1
the colours in this map denote speed , with red the fastest at over 1 metre per second and blue showing a static state fascinatingly , the globe gives viewers an insight into the major ocean gyres , the large systems of rotating ocean currents , particularly those involved with large wind movements ocean currents transport huge amounts of heat around the world , making them one of the most important driving forces of climate			2
the currents are generated from the forces acting upon the water like the @entity69 's rotation , the wind , the temperature and salinity differences and the gravitation of the moon			0
the map relies on data compiled by @entity78 's @entity77 to update its global wind patterns every three hours , and @entity69 and @entity80 to update its ocean surface current patterns every five days			2
details are thin on the ground on the sparsely - designed website , created by software engineer mr @entity6 , but it describes itself as a ' visualisation of global weather conditions forecast by supercomputers '			1
it follows an interactive global wind map , also created by mr @entity6			1
studied together , they reveal just how unpredictable our planet ’s weather system can be			1
ocean currents transport huge amounts of heat around the world , making them one of the most important driving forces of climate			0
perhaps the most striking example is the @entity102 , which makes northwest @entity103 milder than other regions at the same latitude			0
the ocean currents map follows an interactive global wind map ( pictured ) , also created by mr @entity6			1
studied together , they reveal just how unpredictable our planet 's weather system can be users can zoom in on the currents , which are colour - coded to show the severity of the wind			1
here we see the @entity37 to the west of @entity116 swept by powerful gusts the currents are generated from the forces acting upon the water like the @entity69 's rotation , the wind , the temperature and salinity differences and the gravitation of the moon			0
the colours in this map denote speed , with red the fastest at over 1 metre per second and blue showing a static state			0
it appears to take inspiration from the @entity135 - specific wind map created by designers @entity136 and @entity138 and shows currents across the @entity135 in stark monochrome			1
the latest weather - model also has a passing similarity with @entity144 ’s mesmerising perpetual ocean video			0
it uses data from the @entity147 , the @entity78 , and the @entity148 and @entity149 the latest weather - model has a passing similarity with @entity153 s mesmerising @entity152 map ( pictured )			0
@entity144 's ocean current model looks just like @entity156 's @entity155			0

a region that looks calm at a first glance is seen as an active area of currents *circling* as the user moves closer in
