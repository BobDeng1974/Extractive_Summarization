by @entity0 a woman was left feeling ‘ violated and butchered ’ after routine surgery left her with virtually the same effects as female genital mutilation , a tribunal has heard in the first case of its kind			1
dr @entity8 performed a commonplace operation on the woman in 2012 - but last year , after she fell pregnant , a midwife who examined her said she had been mutilated			1
today dr @entity8 appeared before a tribunal where it was claimed he was acting beyond the ' limits of his competence ' and removed parts of the woman 's genitals which should have remained intact			1
accused : dr @entity8 admitted performing a routine labiaplasty on the woman , but denied the @entity24 's claims that he was acting beyond his competence and the results were the equivalent of @entity28 the woman approached the @entity31 in east @entity32 and dr @entity8 performed a labiaplasty operation on her in march 2012 , the @entity29 heard			1
@entity34 is the most common type of women 's cosmetic genital surgery in @entity38 , and can be carried out on the @entity39 , with procedures rising fivefold in the last 10 years			0
it is often used to treat serious medical conditions , but its popularity has also been criticised by experts who say it encourages unnecessary surgery and a trend towards ' designer vaginas '			0
in november the @entity49 said it should no longer be carried out on the @entity39			0
procedure : the woman said she felt like self - harming after the surgery by @entity54 ( pictured ) known only as @entity56 , the woman was ' distressed and unhappy ' by the results of her procedure and contacted doctors to raise her concerns , the fitness to practise panel heard			1
her own gp noted : ‘ @entity64 was upset with the procedure , which was not as expected , unhappy with the surgeon and did not feel she was told the whole truth			0
feels low and feels like harming herself			0
’ @entity70 , for the @entity24 , told the panel : ‘ after the procedure a nurse told her she did n’t know why it had been done as it was n’t needed			1
‘ she wondered if she had been circumcised			0
the patient had no idea what this meant			0
‘ it is quite clear [ from medical notes ] that the impact of this procedure was devastating on @entity56 and caused her extreme anguish , such that there were concerns about the state of her mental health as a result of the procedure			1
‘ coincidentally it seems on this same day another doctor referred the case to the @entity24			2
' her referral is made on the basis that @entity56 had reported being railroaded into the procedure and feeling violated and butchered afterwards			0
’ the woman underwent a number of examinations in 2012 , none of which concluded that she had undergone @entity28 , also known as female circumcision			2
it was not until last year , after she fell pregnant , that a midwife said the result of the procedure had been virtually the equivalent of being circumcised			0
an expert report said the ‘ anatomical result was virtually indistinguishable from @entity28 type @entity110 ’ mr @entity112 told the panel aspects of the procedure could be covered by criminal legislation			1
he said they ‘ would be covered by the definition of the @entity117 and by the definition according to the @entity119			0
' that shows the extent to which there were these injuries			0
’ intentionally performing @entity28 has been a criminal offence since 1985 , and in 2003 the maximum sentence was increased from five to 14 years in jail			2
procedure : the common operation took place at the @entity31 in east @entity32 in march 2012 the panel was told dr @entity8 occasionally performed operations at the @entity31 , but despite his significant surgical experience , had not practised gynaecology since 1994			1
he denied this , saying he performed the operation but that many of the other claims about his work were untrue			1
patient a will not be called to give evidence to the fitness to practise panel , with it instead relying on expert witnesses and medical notes			1
it comes as a minister said victims in criminal @entity28 cases - in other words , where @entity28 has been performed intentionally - could be given anonymity in court , to combat the fear and shame of coming forward			1
justice minister @entity158 ( pictured ) told the @entity159 today : ' the government is committed to tackling and preventing the abhorrent practice of female genital mutilation			0
' we are considering suggestions for strengthening the criminal law on @entity28 and we 'll be looking at whether present arrangements for protecting witnesses ' identities are adequate			2
' dr @entity8 is not accused of a criminal offence and it is not thought he has been questioned by police			1
dr @entity8 has already admitted performing an operation on the woman , known as @entity174 he also admitted not noting down his discussions with her about the surgery , particularly its risks			1
but he denied the other three allegations against him at the tribunal , which were brought by the @entity24			2
they were that he removed and damaged certain parts of the woman 's genitals ; that the result was the equivalent of @entity28 ; and that he had not practised in gynaecology since 1994			1
this morning , the hearing in @entity188 was warned there is a stark difference between a botched operation that technically fell within the definition of @entity28 , and a doctor deliberately conducting the procedure in what would be a criminal offence			1
the panel , chaired by dr @entity198 , was told they can only find the allegation proved if the doctor fully intended to perform @entity28			1
the hearing was told that there are thought to have been two other regulatory cases of doctors , and one of a dentist , involving @entity28 , but all three related to undercover journalists making inquiries about the procedure			2
‘ this is the first time that this matter has properly been assessed and it is important for any case that may follow to set out the ambit of female genital mutilation , ’ mr @entity112 added			0
dr @entity8 is currently subject to an interim conditional @entity24 order , originally imposed in july last year , which restricts the work he is allowed to carry out			1
the string of conditions keeps him closely monitored and bans him from carrying out female genital operations			0
banned : it is illegal to intentionally carry out @entity28 to intentionally carry out @entity28 has been illegal since 1985 , but @entity38 's first criminal charges were not brought until last month			2
dr @entity225 , 31 , from @entity226 , east @entity32 , was working at the @entity227 in north @entity32 when he was accused of carrying out the procedure			1
@entity230 , 40 , from @entity231 , @entity32 , is accused of encouraging and helping him , prosecutors said			2
both will appear before @entity234 magistrates later this month			0
the prosecutions follow a lengthy campaign by human rights groups to raise awareness of the procedure 's existence			0
it is thought as many as 66,000 women in the @entity38 have suffered @entity28 with 24,000 girls under 11 also at risk			2
the tradition originated in ethnic groups spread throughout 28 @entity248 countries , including @entity249 , @entity250 , @entity251 and @entity252 , and spread across the world as groups emigrated			0
the circumcision or ' cutting ' is often carried out for cultural reasons , sometimes because it shows a girl 's virginity on her wedding night			0
@entity28 is defined as any partial or full removal of a woman 's outer sexual organs			0
it can also involve sewing up the vagina .			0
