by @entity0 in @entity1 and @entity3 reporter published : 11:50 est , 27 june 2013 updated : 03:19 est , 28 june 2013 win : @entity4 , pictured arriving at an @entity6 summit in @entity1 , was confident of securing a deal to protect @entity9 's rebate @entity4 scored a vital victory for taxpayers last night as he protected @entity9 ’s £ 3.1billion @entity6 rebate			1
the prime minister fought off a raid by @entity15 on the @entity9 ’s annual clawback of funding from @entity1			1
@entity18 said @entity9 ’s refund should not be exempt from a deal to hand over £ 300million a year in taxpayer - funded farming subsidies for new member states			1
in a second victory for mr @entity4 , @entity23 also backed down and agreed to the first ever @entity6 budget reduction in its 56 - year history			1
they will vote on the £ 30billion cut to £ 770billion next week			2
mr @entity4 blocked the refund raid after talks with @entity31 president @entity30 ahead of the @entity6 summit in @entity1			2
exemption from the farming subsidy deal was a key part of the @entity9 ’s rebate settlement , agreed at landmark talks in february , but it has come under increasing attack from @entity15			1
mr @entity4 said details should now be ‘ locked down ’ in @entity6 law			2
a @entity42 source later said there were ‘ assurances ’ that @entity1 will stick to february ’s deal			0
the rebate was won for @entity9 by @entity47 in 1984 after her ‘ handbagging ’ of @entity50 leaders and her vow of ‘ not a penny more ’ for @entity1			1
the refund was granted because @entity9 get disproportionately less in farm subsidies than @entity15			1
as he went into the meeting mr @entity4 said : ' it is absolutely essential that we stick to the deal we reached in february and that we protect the @entity9 rebate , and i will make sure that we do that			1
' a @entity42 source said afterwards : ' we have assurances from mr @entity30 that we will stick to the deal done in february			0
we are confident this is resolved now			0
' mr @entity4 added : ' this council should be about doing in @entity1 what we are doing in @entity9 , which is getting control of spending , making sure we live within our means , and then making ourselves more competitive , getting rid of regulations , making it easier for businesses to create jobs			2
' but despite reductions in some areas of spending such as regional aid , the cost of running the @entity6 civil service , assembly and quangos will still rise by 1.7 per cent			2
and spending on the pensions of @entity1 bureaucrats will rise by 7.2 per cent partly because of costs associated with an increase in officials taking early retirement			0
@entity89 , the leader of the @entity90 , said : ' this is an historic cut but we still have enormous amounts of fat that can be trimmed			0
' @entity95 is normally the first thing to be cut in any government ’s budget			2
only in the @entity6 would it increase at a time of belt - tightening			0
' @entity102 : mr @entity4 is calling for rules to be relaxed to encourage firms to take on young people the prime minister celebrated a major diplomatic coup in @entity1 in february after securing the first @entity6 spending cut in its history			1
but four months on , @entity111 's government launched a last - ditch attempt to slash @entity9 ’s rebate			1
after talks with @entity31 president @entity30 , mr @entity4 insisted the deal still stands			0
under the agreement every other country with rebates had to agree to give up some of the money			0
diplomats hailed it as the biggest @entity9 triumph for the @entity9 in an @entity6 negotiation since the rebate was won by @entity47 at the @entity126 summit almost 30 years ago			1
mr @entity4 ’s deal will save @entity9 taxpayers hundreds of millions of pounds on what they would have been forced to pay under the @entity131 ’s initial plans to increase the budget			2
the prime minister arrived at a summit in @entity1 insisting he would block any attempt to reduce the rebate			0
mr @entity30 has declared improving the job prospects of young people the main theme for the two - day gathering			0
battle : the prime minister insisted it was ' essential ' that the @entity9 rebate remained protected some 5.6 million are out of work in the eurozone , and in @entity147 and @entity148 the youth unemployment rate has rocketed to over 50 per cent			1
mr @entity30 is emphasising the need for money to be pumped into projects that could boost their employment chances			0
but mr @entity4 is due to argue that loosening labour market rules and freeing up small and medium companies to take on young staff is more important			0
he has staked @entity9 's continuing membership of the @entity6 on his ability to negotiate fundamental reform of it - with an in - out referendum due to be held in 2017 if the @entity162 win the general election			1
mr @entity4 could also face questions from @entity166 chancellor @entity165 and others after it emerged that eavesdropping agency @entity169 has been mass - monitoring global phone and internet traffic			0
@entity175 has openly challenged the validity of the @entity178 surveillance operation , the existence of which was revealed by @entity180 whistle - blower @entity179 .			0

leaders agreed to an £ *819billion* budget ' *ceiling* ' in february
savings were made on various projects and perks for @entity6 officials
@entity9 's rebate secured by @entity47 was protected
but @entity15 argued it should be cut to cover changes to farming subsidies
