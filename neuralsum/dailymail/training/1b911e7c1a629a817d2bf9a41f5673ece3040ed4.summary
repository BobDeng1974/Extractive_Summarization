@entity0 believes his players are now convinced by his methods after their @entity4 victory			1
the @entity5 had spoken just a week earlier about being ‘ bored ’ and ‘ frustrated ’ with his team after a run of five draws in six matches			2
but @entity0 feels the players have bought into his vision and says the 1 - 0 win at @entity12 can prove a turning point in his tenure			1
@entity16 fires @entity17 into a 1 - 0 lead to earn all three points for @entity0 's side against @entity21 @entity16 ( 11 ) watches on as his powerful striker flies past the dive of @entity21 goalkeeper @entity24 ‘ the players are convinced now , ’ he said			1
‘ i know we had that bad day at @entity27 ( 8 - 0 defeat ) and that will be there all of my life			1
‘ but the players are confident that what we ’re doing is working			1
we just needed a win			2
‘ this now is confirmation of what we do			2
i ’m still thinking we need to improve because i do n’t want any more draws			2
i want to win football games			2
’ sunday ’s victory – achieved thanks to @entity16 ’s last - minute strike – was just their third maximum return of the season , while they have drawn 10 times			1
and @entity0 added : ‘ you need to start somewhere			1
first , i want my team to be solid			0
we conceded like 2,000 goals last season in the first part of the season			1
@entity17 boss @entity0 said the players are now convinced by his methods after another @entity52 win the @entity17 winger wheels away in celebration of his 90th minute winner at @entity56 ‘ i want us first to be difficult to beat , then you start playing and taking chances			1
‘ but how long does that take ? i still want to see more , i do n’t change because of this one game			0
i ’m ambitious – that ’s the mentality i want			0
‘ the next game is the most important			0
last year when we won the derby we did n’t think the next game was important and we went two months without winning a game			0
‘ i ’m going to fight until the players have that mentality , that only the next game matters			2
‘ that ’s what i want to see now			0
i do n’t expect them to play like @entity71 – it ’s about being the same team but with the confidence to produce those special moments			0
’ @entity17 manager @entity0 reacts furiously to the first half foul from @entity78 defender @entity77 @entity16 ’s special moment in stoppage - time was his third goal on @entity82 in as many seasons			1
the former @entity85 winger has been below his best so far in this campaign , but @entity0 hopes that derby glory can prove a catalyst for an upturn in his form			1
‘ we need moments to make the team believe in what we ’re doing is working			0
@entity91 showed that , ' he said			0
‘ last year he was brilliant in january , maybe that will come a little bit earlier this time			0
@entity16 looks towards the @entity21 fans as he is joined by his @entity17 team - mates in celebration ‘ this season we ’ve been asking him to do too many things in defence – he has been too far from the opposition goal			1
‘ the responsibility is 50 - 50 – some of it mine because of the way we play , the other half is with the player and when he gets the chance he needs to produce			2
‘ you do n’t score away from home in a derby three years in a row if you ’re bad , no , he ’s a special player			0
‘ this will help him a lot			0
i would say he will be very good over the next few games now			0
