few vehicles can keep pace with a @entity3 race car over any distance but here 's one that may be in with a shout			0
reigning f - 1 champions @entity9 lined up their latest driver @entity10 alongside a @entity13 @entity12 fighter jet for a spectacular drag race			1
the event was held at a military airbase near @entity17 ahead of the @entity18 @entity3 so @entity18 driver @entity10 was the obvious choice to get behind the wheel			1
but there was only ever going to be one winner , and when the awesome power of the @entity12 's two jet engines kicked in , it surged ahead before soaring off into the clouds			2
it is @entity10 's first season with @entity9 with the 24 - year - old replacing fellow @entity18 @entity43			1
his teammate @entity44 's is the reigning world champion			0
@entity9 , which is based in @entity45 have been struggling to adapt their car to the new rules for 2014 whilst maintaining their performance , with the biggest obstacle appearing to be incorporating the new turbo - charged 1.6 litre @entity51 engines with a host of energy - saving devices			1
engine : @entity51 1.6l turbo boosted by electric motor power : 750bhp top speed : 205mph ( estimated ) weight : 690kg electronics : @entity63 standard @entity64 optional extras : @entity67 weather tyres / @entity69 dice / go faster stripe / engine : 2x @entity72 low - bypass turbofan engines power : 32,000 - pound - thrust top speed : @entity76 1.8 ( 1,190mph ) weight : 23,537kg ( in fighter role ) electronics : radar / helmet - mounted sights / missile guidance system optional extras : @entity83 six - barrel cannon / aim - 9 sidewinder missile / cluster bomb @entity18 @entity9 drive @entity10 was at the wheel of the race car replacing the old v8 engines , this change is seen by many as the principal defining factor on the track as opposed to aerodynamics			1
looking ahead to the season @entity93 believes it wo n't be until may before @entity9 are competitive			2
he said : â€˜ we believe it is inherently a good car			0
i have every confidence in the team			0
' there are engineering solutions and there is no better set of engineers in the pit lane			0
by the time we get to the @entity110 races in may , we should be ok			0
