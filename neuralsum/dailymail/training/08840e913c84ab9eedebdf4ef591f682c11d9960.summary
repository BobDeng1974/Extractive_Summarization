@entity0 is set to become the catalyst in a complicated january transfer window jigsaw for @entity3			1
manager @entity4 has to sell the @entity6 striker or at least trade to buy , and this is how it could work ... @entity0 could be offloaded back to @entity6 to @entity10 , and that way @entity3 could then lure goalkeeper @entity12 to @entity13			1
@entity0 is central to @entity3 's activity in the transfer market this month @entity3 could splash £ 30million on @entity18 's @entity17 striker @entity16 then @entity3 may splash out £ 30million to sign striker @entity16 from @entity18 given that @entity19 has just signed @entity10 striker @entity20			1
@entity3 might also offload @entity23 midfielder @entity21 to @entity18 , @entity24 or even @entity10			1
the @entity25 know they need a goalscorer , and they toyed with idea of taking @entity28 on loan from @entity30 , but the @entity32 striker preferred to goal back to his boyhood club @entity34			1
@entity3 also wanted @entity36 's @entity35 , but the @entity38 star chose to join @entity24 on loan , as did @entity41 's @entity40			1
@entity3 's @entity23 midfielder @entity21 could be on his way to @entity6 this month with @entity24 leading the interest @entity35 snubbed a move to the @entity46 to join @entity47 at @entity24 before the window , @entity4 insisted that he would do no business - maybe he was just trying to keep the fees down			1
the fact is that @entity3 are desperate to bring two or three players in and reshape their squad			1
the activity around @entity13 could be frenetic in the coming fortnight or so			1
@entity57 centre back @entity56 is @entity58 bound , but @entity59 may yet move in for the @entity61 defender if @entity62 refuses new terms			1
@entity62 is out of contract in the summer and eyeing a move to @entity41 or @entity3			1
meanwhile , @entity67 goalkeeper @entity66 is set to quit @entity68 in the summer and move to @entity69 in a £ 25million deal			1
@entity56 looks set for a move to @entity58 , but @entity59 may yet make a late move for the defender on the other side of north @entity75 , @entity41 hope to sign @entity77 defensive midfielder @entity76 within the next fortnight			1
the fee for 22 - year - old @entity76 would be in excess of £ 25million			1
as first revealed by @entity82 months ago , @entity57 's money men are doing the maths to see if they can afford to sign @entity84 from @entity85 in the summer			1
a massive part of the challenge is to make sure @entity57 comply with @entity90 's @entity89 rules , which would also prove a major impediment for @entity30 if they moved for @entity84 , as has been mooted			1
the £ 500million overall cost of @entity84 could potentially be sorted by @entity57 , not just because of their oil rich @entity94 backers , as part of an agreement with @entity98 and , down the line , @entity102 side @entity100			1
@entity57 are working out a way to sign @entity84 from @entity85 @entity104 is likely to be offered back to @entity105 this week from his loan spell at @entity24 , and in turn the @entity105 could offer the player to other clubs			1
@entity111 , among others , would be interested			1
@entity3 , meanwhile , may offload @entity112 during this transfer window with @entity114 , @entity115 and @entity116 all interested			1
@entity112 could be heading for a @entity3 exit with @entity114 , @entity115 and @entity116 interested i am hearing ... that some delegates at a conference of football administrators in @entity122 this tuesday to discuss ' third - party ownership ' of players will raise the situation of @entity127 's confused status with @entity57			1
city have airbrushed previous claims that @entity127 was on loan from @entity100 and now say he signed for them for the whole season			2
but those who take time to analyse the chronology of events have noted that according to @entity102 there is an issue about an initial contractual agreement between @entity127 and @entity139 ( @entity139 )			2
@entity127 's contract with @entity100 has been the subject of much controversy @entity127 in action for @entity57 during their draw at @entity145 on saturday @entity139 it seems is a company owned by the same @entity94 owners who control both @entity57 and @entity100			2
i am hearing there are some at next week 's @entity122 summit that might raise the question of whether in actual fact @entity127 's status with @entity57 is similar to that of @entity156 at @entity59 during the 2006 - 07 season			2
@entity59 had to pay a fine then massive compensation after it was ruled they had wrongly registered @entity156 on the basis that he was actually owned by a third - party company , which is outlawed by the @entity46 and @entity164			2
recent legislation has stated that @entity166 no longer recognise third - party ownership of players			2
but there remains a big dispute about this issue since such a system is how many clubs in @entity175 and poorer clubs in @entity177 are able to survive			2
@entity156 joined @entity59 in 2006 , but the club were fined as he was owned by a third - party company the conference will be heated , with legal and financial representatives arguing against so called global football law			2
the complex @entity127 case could well be highlighted			2
if it is and further investigation of the deal is compelled then there could many outcomes			2
should @entity57 , who strangely keep changing their story over the issue , be found to have breached any regulations then the club could possibly face sanctions			2
those sanctions would potentially range from fines to point deductions , and the latter scenario could impact on the title race and @entity201 places			2
i understand at least one @entity46 club is set to ask the @entity46 to further investigate			1
i am also hearing ... a top level @entity115 official rang an estate agent in the @entity208 area ( where the club 's training base is ) to find two short - term rental flats			2
not for new boss @entity212 but two new loan signings			2
one of them is set to be @entity41 striker @entity215			1
@entity41 striker @entity215 could be set for a loan move to @entity115 @entity217 insists @entity218 should lift the @entity219 ' or at @entity166 's @entity221 headquarters on monday			1
@entity218 is favourite with the bookmakers with @entity224 goalkeeper @entity223 behind him and @entity84 likely to come third			1
former @entity85 and @entity226 star @entity217 , 42 , accepts that @entity218 and @entity227 disappointed at the @entity229 finals in @entity23 last summer			1
@entity218 is one of three finalists for @entity166 's @entity232 award on monday in @entity221 but @entity217 , who now heads up a football networking website similar to @entity234 in called @entity235 90 , feels the phenomenal year @entity218 enjoyed , highlighted by leading @entity226 to their 10th @entity201 victory in may , means the award should be his			0
@entity217 , who twice won the award , said : ' i know @entity239 won the @entity229 and there are those who think @entity223 , who is such a great keeper and was a big part of their success , should be recognised while the @entity229 was n't so good for @entity218			0
' but for me it has to be @entity218			0
he 's had a fantastic year all the way through for @entity226			0
' that leads to the obvious question			0
who does @entity217 think is the better player - ronaldo or @entity84 ? @entity217 believes his @entity252 compatriot should win the award ahead of @entity84 and @entity223 ' it 's the impossible question , ' he said			0
' they are both so good			0
it 's like comparing caviar and truffle			0
' back when i was playing there were usually 10 strong contenders every year			0
i think the overall level of top players was stronger			0
i recent years it has pretty much a question of @entity218 or @entity84			0
' @entity217 's team of 2014 such is the pressure in the hot seat , each week a @entity46 manager 's survival rate can be cut			0
as it stands @entity272 is now 7 - 2 to favourite to get the bullet			0
@entity275 is now just 4 - 1 and @entity276 9 - 1			0
interestingly , though , despite a good draw for @entity145 against @entity57 , @entity277 is relatively short at 7 - 1			0
@entity279 i was having a coffee with a senior football administrator the other day and he argued the case for a winter break			0
his proposed break would have started last week after the @entity287 third round games and last for at least 12 days			0
to clear the decks in the fixture calendar , the plan would be to scrap @entity287 replays			0
clubs would also have to be contractually obliged not to play any form of matches during the break period			0
i tend to agree and do n't think the loss of replays would undermine the @entity287			0
it could even see a few more shocks and recapture some romanticism			0
certainly players would benefit from a break in the schedule mentally as much as physically			0
@entity303 has been given some time off by @entity4 after a busy first half of the season and that might have a positive effect in future for the national team when it comes to tournaments			1
@entity3 have taken the decision to allow @entity303 a personal break in @entity314 right now			1
the 20 year old has had a hectic year or so and it would seem a wise move by the club			0
@entity3 will hope that when @entity303 returns he will have shaken off signs of fatigue and also that his mind will be suitably cleared to sign a new contract			1
btw one thing is clear about the sordid saga of @entity324			0
he has been given some awful advice			0
if he has actually paid @entity328 people to construct a ' campaign ' to re-establish himself as a professional footballer then he has been ripped off			0
his legal counsel would seem questionable too			0
after coming out of prison on licence he should have stayed as best he could under the radar , displayed genuine remorse , and sought to rebuild his life and career from the bottom again or sought permission to find a club abroad			0
@entity324 ' search for a new club continues after his move to @entity344 fell through he should have gone out of his way to shun the spotlight and eased himself into the game in the manner some other players have managed to in similar circumstances			0
but with a website stridently still claiming his innocence and it would seem some ' supporters ' with questionable attitudes towards the victim in this case , he has merely courted publicity to such a fever pitch that it 's hard to see how he can actually find a professional club wiling to employ him , certainly until the outcome of his appeal against conviction .			0

@entity3 must offload @entity0 before they buy
@entity0 could go to @entity10 , clearing the way for @entity4 to sign @entity12 and @entity16
@entity3 may also sell @entity21 to @entity24 in january
@entity66 is set for a £ 25m switch to @entity224 in the summer
@entity41 would need to fork out over £ 25m for @entity76
