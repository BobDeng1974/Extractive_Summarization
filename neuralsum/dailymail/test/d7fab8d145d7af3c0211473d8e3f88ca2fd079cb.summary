under pressure : @entity1 , the chief executive of @entity2 , which has been forced to pay £ 7.75million to @entity3 after the regulator found the energy giant had overcharged customers after price rises power giant @entity2 has been ordered to pay a £ 7.75million penalty after it ripped off customers who were switching to rivals			1
the money will go to @entity3 to fund the organisation ’s work helping those trying to cut their energy bills			2
@entity2 effectively overcharged thousands who decided to move to other suppliers after it announced price rises in january 2013 and again in early 2014			1
industry rules state that energy companies must give customers 30 days ’ notice of any price rise			0
once a customer states they intend to move , the firm is not allowed to impose an exit fee or apply the new higher tariff even if the move takes place after the date of the increase			2
however , industry regulator @entity33 found that @entity2 broke the rules by hitting tens of thousands of departing customers with a higher tariff in the days before their account was switched			1
the firm admitted the mistake as far as customers who paid by direct debit or cheque were concerned			2
however , it failed to notify @entity33 that it also affected people with meters until late in the investigation			1
it has refunded £ 8 to £ 12 to 40,000 customers who paid by cash or cheque and is now trying to find another 7,000 meter customers to pay them an average of £ 3.42			1
while the sums involved are relatively low , @entity33 imposed a high penalty because @entity2 did the same thing in january 2012			1
at that time , it was ordered to refund £ 1.4million to customers and pay £ 300,000 in lieu of a penalty to @entity58			2
the firm claimed it had implemented new procedures to stop it happening again , but was guilty of the same mistake in both 2013 and 2014			2
' absolutely unacceptable ' : @entity33 said the penalty reflected @entity2 's ' repeated failings ' on billing rules after the company incorrectly imposed exit fees and overcharged customers @entity33 ’s enforcement chief , @entity68 , said : ‘ our rules give customers a chance to avoid exit fees and higher costs when suppliers put up prices			1
these are important customer protections and it is vital suppliers play by the rules			0
the energy regulator has imposed fines on energy companies totalling £ 168 million since 2010			0
@entity86 's @entity85 energy suppliers are responsible for £ 99million of the payments , with @entity88 the worst offender among them with their figure totalling £ 34.6million			0
@entity2 has been fined £ 24.8million in total			2
the payments are as follows : november 2012 : @entity2 agrees to pay out £ 1.7million to customers and charities after customers were incorrectly charged exit fees or overcharged following price rises			1
july 2013 : the company agrees a £ 3million package of fines and money for customers after it misreported the number of energy - saving light bulbs it had distributed under an energy efficiency scheme			2
may 2014 : @entity2 agrees to pay £ 12million to vulnerable customers for mis - selling			1
april 2015 : the company agrees to pay £ 7.75million to @entity3 to help vulnerable customers in addition to £ 400,000 already paid to those affected , after it was found to have overcharged in the wake of price rises			1
‘ it is important that @entity2 has repaid potentially affected customers and co-operated with the investigation			1
however it ’s absolutely unacceptable that it failed to provide these vital customer protections yet again and this persistent failure is the reason for the high penalty			1
’ citizens advice chief executive @entity122 said the ruling should send a warning to other firms			0
‘ consumer rights can not be ignored , ’ she said			0
‘ customers should n’t be trapped in higher bills			0
with prices up a third since 2010 people must have the freedom to shop around for a better deal			0
‘ consumers must be confident that the regulator will take strong action when companies fail so this judgment is welcome news			0
‘ it is positive that the @entity33 penalty will go towards helping people who are struggling to heat and light their homes			0
’ @entity2 apologised and has agreed to fund an independent external audit into what went wrong			0
a spokesman said : ‘ we have been open and transparent about this failure to @entity33 and have agreed to make a payment to citizens advice which will be used to support its @entity152 engagement programme , which provides face to face energy advice			0
‘ @entity2 is committed to ensuring that no one will lose out financially and is pleased that the payment is going to a worthwhile cause that will provide support to those in need			0
