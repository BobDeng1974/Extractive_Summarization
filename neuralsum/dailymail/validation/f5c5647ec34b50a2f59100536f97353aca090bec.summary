a fifth of patients turning up in @entity2 have minor ailments including sore throats , athlete 's foot and headlice , according to an analysis			1
it calculates that more than four million visits a year are unnecessary and cost the @entity10 £ 290million annually			1
in the worst cases , doctors have reported patients showing up because they were hungover , their false nails were hurting or they had paint in their hair			2
the problem is largely caused by the fact that patients are finding it increasingly difficult to see their gp , particularly out of hours			1
a fifth of patients turning up in @entity2 have minor ailments including sore throats , athlete 's foot and headlice , a study has found ( file picture ) many go to @entity2 in the knowledge that they will at least be seen by a doctor that day , even if they have to wait four hours			1
even health secretary @entity28 has admitted taking his children to casualty at the weekend rather than making an appointment with a gp			0
but the unnecessary visits are adding to the pressures of busy departments and diverting staff from treating patients who are very seriously ill. it all came to a head in january when 13 hospitals declared major internal incidents in a two - day period as they were unable to cope with the numbers coming through the door			1
an analysis of data from 15 @entity2 units by the consultancy firm @entity46 found that 19 per cent of admissions were for what are known as self - treatable conditions			1
these include coughs , colds , muscle sprains , athlete 's foot , headlice or babies with colic			1
the data covers one in 10 of the @entity2 units across @entity60 so , if the trends are the same , an estimated 4.1million of the 21.7million visits last year were for minor ailments			1
health secretary @entity28 has admitted taking his children to casualty at the weekend rather than making an appointment with a gp experts are urging patients to keep their medicine cabinets well stocked and to make better use of their pharmacists , where they can be seen and offered advice and treatment			0
@entity76 , chief executive of the @entity77 of @entity78 , which represents the manufacturers of over the counter medicines and commissioned the research said : ‘ it is vital that the @entity10 raises awareness of the range of different services available to people and when to access them appropriately			0
‘ pharmacists are well placed to provide advice to people with minor conditions , who do n’t need to visit the gp or @entity2 , thereby ensuring they receive the support they need , without diverting @entity10 resources from people who really need them			2
’ he added that the @entity10 was facing a ‘ crisis ’ because staffing levels and finances were unable to cope with the needs of the steadily rising and aging population			0
‘ this can not continue and that ’s why we are calling for immediate action			0
’ but dr @entity106 , president of the @entity107 , which represents @entity2 doctors , said attempts to divert patients did not work			2
dr @entity106 , an @entity2 consultant at @entity112 in @entity113 , @entity114 , added that the ‘ @entity2 brand is well - known and trusted ’ so ‘ patients will continue to attend ’			2
he said the only solution was to install gp clinics at @entity2 units so patients with minor ailments could be sent there , leaving staff to deal with the more serious cases			2
figures show that 21.7million patients attended @entity2 in 2013/14 , a rise of more than a third in a decade			0
and the @entity10 has missed its target for ensuring 95 per cent of patients are dealt with within four hours every week for the last six months			0
in november , @entity28 admitted in the @entity131 he had taken his own children to @entity2 ‘ precisely because i did n’t want to wait until later on to take them to a gp ’			0
‘ if parents have an unwell child who needs medical attention @entity2 provides a trusted service			0
