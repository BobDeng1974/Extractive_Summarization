culprit : several £ 100 bottles of @entity47 were circulating mr @entity0 told the dinner guests : ‘ there are only two people fit to be prime minister : @entity11 and @entity52			1
@entity52 has made it clear that he does n’t want it so that leaves only one candidate – @entity11			1
@entity3 is incapable of focusing on serious issues and has no gravitas			2
he is n’t a team player and plays to the gallery the whole time			2
‘ the whole @entity3 routine will wear thin with the electorate very quickly if he became @entity51			2
and he ca n’t make tough decisions			2
‘ @entity11 is a team player who is serious and substantial			2
look at all the tough stuff he has done already in @entity66			2
@entity6 has little chance of gaining the support of the electorate – she ca n’t even gain the support of her colleagues			2
’ one witness said : ‘ it was an extraordinary and sustained onslaught by @entity0			2
he fired an @entity74 at @entity3 and had a go at @entity6 for good measure			1
‘ like the rest of us , @entity0 enjoyed mr @entity17 ’s wine and tongues became looser as the evening progressed			1
everyone was gobsmacked at what he said			0
’ the dinner took place on december 5 – the day @entity86 died			1

’ @entity20 mps have been taken aback by the outbreak of hostilities between mr @entity0 and mr @entity11 on one side , and mr @entity3 on the other			1
contenders ? @entity0 is said to favour @entity11 but @entity6 could also be in the running the @entity116 revealed on february 2 how the chancellor and mr @entity0 have joined forces in an attempt to deny the @entity20 leadership crown to mr @entity3			1

an ally of the @entity128 said : ‘ @entity3 was puzzled and hurt by @entity0 ’s unwarranted attack			0

it seems he has thrown his lot in with @entity11 instead			0
@entity11 has zero support among the public ; @entity3 has enormous appeal			0
’ mr @entity0 sparked further controversy yesterday by claiming there is a ‘ ridiculous ’ number of @entity140 among the prime minister ’s inner circle			0

the adopted son of an @entity148 fishmonger , mr @entity0 issued a fresh denial yesterday that he has leadership ambitions , saying he lacked the ‘ extra spark of charisma and star quality ’			1
influence : the high - profile figures were dining at the private @entity18 home of @entity17 but some @entity20 @entity109 believe his increasingly high - profile political activities and pronouncements , in private and public , indicate he is preparing his own leadership campaign			1
one female conservative mp said : ‘ @entity0 is the perfect @entity20 role model			1
he won a scholarship to a fee - paying school on merit , not thanks to @entity164 and @entity166 ’s cheque book			0
