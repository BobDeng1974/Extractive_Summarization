inside a hotel room in this dreary industrial town in the @entity3 , a tearful @entity0 told his boss @entity4 that he was leaving @entity5 for @entity6 , a deal that will earn him about £ 50million a year as the highest - paid driver in history			1
@entity11 ’s pole position ahead of today ’s typhoon - threatened @entity13 @entity12 , a place ahead of his championship rival and @entity17 team - mate @entity16 , was a mere sideshow in a febrile paddock of intrigue , open cheque books and revolving doors			1
@entity0 ’s move was confirmed in a press release early yesterday morning @entity13 time , just hours after @entity0 texted @entity4 to ask if he could see him in his room			1
‘ i knew it was n’t room service , ’ said @entity4 with gallows humour of the 9.45pm message			0
only minutes before he had confidently predicted @entity0 would stay			1
@entity0 is pictured in the @entity5 garage during practice for the @entity13 @entity12 @entity0 will leave @entity5 at the end of the season after winning four drivers ' titles @entity0 signs autographs ahead of this weekend 's @entity13 @entity12 in @entity37 the move is sure to affect the top end of the driver market over the next few months : @entity41 is almost certain to make way for @entity0 at @entity6 , with @entity43 his most likely destination			1
the @entity43 management , including chairman @entity46 , who fell out with @entity41 during his single year at the team in 2007 , are willing to be reunited with the turbulent @entity48			0
if @entity41 does go to @entity43 , rather than take a year ’s sabbatical , he is likely to replace @entity50 , possibly bringing an end to the @entity53 ’s 15 - year career in @entity54			1
@entity43 sources have indicated privately that @entity41 would be granted no 1 status and paired with a youthful no 2			0
therefore , @entity58 , who only costs £ 500,000 a year , would stay and @entity50 would go			0
the @entity59 understands that @entity16 has agreed in principle a new deal to keep him at @entity17 through to the end of 2017			1
video : watch outgoing @entity6 president @entity64 speak about @entity0 @entity0 won four drivers ' titles with the team , establishing himself as the best in the world @entity0 is 117 points behind championship leader @entity16 and has decided to move on @entity71 threatens both the smooth - running of the @entity13 @entity12 race and the dash out of @entity13			1
the worst effects of the storm are due to hit @entity37 late tonight or tomorrow , when the sport ’s people , cars and freight are trying to travel 6,000 miles to @entity80 for next week ’s @entity81			0
regarding this sunday 's grand prix , an @entity83 spokesman said : ‘ the timing for the organisers to change the race time has passed			0
we will see what is going on in the morning			0
the safety of the people has to be the most important thing			0
’ the possibility remains the race could run behind the safety car , with half - points an option should the race not be completed			0
@entity5 confirmed that @entity0 ’s place will be taken by 20 - year - old @entity99 @entity98 from the start of next season			1
@entity6 will confirm @entity0 in their driver line - up in the next few weeks			1
he will sign a three - year deal worth £ 150m			0
the @entity59 understands @entity0 negotiated his deal directly with @entity105 , the new president of @entity6 and chairman of the @entity6 ’s parent company @entity107			1
neither outgoing @entity6 president @entity64 nor team principal @entity64 was actively involved in negotiations			2
it is thought that @entity111 , @entity0 ’s friend and mentor , advised the driver about the move			1
@entity0 has no manager and negotiates his own highly lucrative deals			2
asked about @entity111 ’s guidance , @entity0 said : ‘ mind your own business			2
’ despite wearing the grungy look of a student doing @entity122 on 10 dollars a day , @entity0 is said to be protective about his money			2
a new father , to @entity125 , he lives quietly on a farm in the tax haven of @entity128 , enjoying his privacy as much as his hero @entity130 , whose feats at @entity6 he aspires to recreate			2
@entity98 will replace @entity0 at @entity5 , moving from the sister team @entity132 @entity133 has impressed in his first season in @entity54 and will get his chance with @entity5 next season it is understood that @entity0 started to seek a move away following the @entity139 @entity12 at the start of september			1
in his five years with @entity5 , he won four world drivers ’ titles and helped them to four constructors ’ championships			1
but he suffered dents to his stellar reputation this season after being regularly outclassed by team - mate @entity148 , who has won three races to the @entity151 ’s none			1
although @entity5 have massively outperformed @entity6 , they have not managed to match the dominance of @entity17			1
that was the case again in qualifying yesterday , with @entity11 and @entity16 annexing the front row of the grid			2
@entity11 was supremely quick on the most testing track in the world , finishing two - tenths of a second ahead of his title rival			1
@entity11 suffered electrical problems at the last race in @entity165 , allowing @entity16 to take a three - point lead , but he is far from crushed			1
that is more than could be said for @entity16 ’s car after he broke his front suspension when he crashed into the tyre wall after carrying too much speed into the first corner in practice			2
‘ @entity11 was extremely quick today , ’ admitted @entity16			2
‘ i did the best i could			0
the guys did a great job to rebuild the car after i binned it			0
today i just was n’t feeling it			0
i do n’t know why			0
tomorrow is the day where you get the points so i ’m looking forward to all the tricky weather			0
’ as for @entity0 , he will start ninth , three places behind @entity148			2
but , naturally , he was still smiling			0
laughing , in fact , all the way to the bank			0
@entity0 adjusts his headphones as he prepares to drive ahead of the third practice session in @entity37			0

four - time world champion @entity0 will leave @entity5
' this is not a *decision* against @entity5 , it is for something else , ' he said .
@entity0 is fifth in the standings this season , well *adrift* of @entity16
the @entity151 won the title in 2010 , 2011 , 2012 and 2013
@entity99 rookie @entity98 will replace @entity0 at @entity5
@entity0 has *seemingly* set up a move to rivals @entity6
