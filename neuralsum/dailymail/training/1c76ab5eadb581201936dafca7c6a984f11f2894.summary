a mayor is in line for an 80 per cent pay rise , in a move which could trigger a fresh wave of spiralling local government salary increases			1
despite his council making £ 70million of cuts , sir @entity6 could see his pay go up from £ 56,000 to £ 100,000			1
the government has pleaded with councils to cut the pay of their best - rewarded officials at a time of austerity			2
but under the proposals , sir @entity6 ’s deputy could more than double his salary from £ 34,000 to £ 75,000			1
former @entity20 mp sir @entity6 , seen here with his wife @entity22 , was elected mayor of @entity24 this year			1
the council is pushing through £ 70million spending curbs and shedding 1,000 jobs this winter but a £ 100,000 salary would make sir @entity6 the second highest - paid elected mayor in the country , behind only @entity31 ( pictured ) , who is on £ 144,000 six assistant mayors would pocket 65 per cent increases from £ 26,000 to £ 40,000 , and all 47 city councillors would see their basic allowances go up 20 per cent from £ 10,000 to £ 12,000			1
former @entity20 mp sir @entity6 was elected mayor of @entity24 this year			1
the council is pushing through £ 70million spending curbs and shedding 1,000 jobs this winter			2
sir @entity6 last month described the cuts as ‘ enormously problematic ’ and added that he was ‘ determined to minimise the pain on front - line services and , so far as i can , protect the jobs of the people who provide the services ’			1
but a £ 100,000 salary would make him the second highest - paid elected mayor in the country , behind only @entity31 , who is on £ 144,000			1
if the pay rises go through , they are likely to have an immediate knock - on effect across the country			1
local authorities tend to set elected members ’ pay and allowance rates by comparing themselves with their neighbours			2
some councils have doubled the level of allowances paid to elected members in the past five years by claiming they were falling behind			2
the increases in @entity24 were proposed by a four - strong remuneration panel			2
sir @entity6 has said that the panel is independent , but the city ’s one @entity65 councillor , @entity64 , said it had been appointed after @entity20 won all but two council seats in may elections , and called it ‘ hand - picked ’			1
he said : ‘ the pay proposals are disgraceful			0
the panel has been promoted as independent , but its members were appointed by @entity20 after the election , with no involvement for opposition parties			0
‘ it has a representative of business , which needs to keep sweet with the council , and of a university , which needs co-operation with the council to get its expansion plans approved			0
’ local government minister @entity85 said : ‘ true to form this shows you ca n’t trust @entity20 councils with public money			0
it ’s scandalous that they are lining their pockets with bumper pay packets way out of step with the tough economic circumstances			0
these councillors are the ultimate champagne socialists			0
’ when an mp , sir @entity6 employed his two daughters , @entity99 and @entity100 , as junior secretaries			1
he also employed his wife @entity22 , who earned £ 25,000 a year as office manager			2
and he claimed for a £ 472.59 bailiff ’s bill on expenses after debt collectors were sent to his constituency office when he fell behind with his rent in october 2007			2
the fees office agreed he should not be liable for the bill and reimbursed him			0
sir @entity6 said the cost of the pay increases was met by his decision earlier this year to get rid of the authority ’s chief executive , which saved £ 250,000			1
but after details of the rises sparked a row , he last night promised to delay a council vote on implementing them			0
‘ the report of the remuneration panel was leaked before we had the chance to read or discuss the contents , ’ he said			0
‘ i am firmly of the view that politicians ought not to set their own pay			0
i also believe that those making recommendations should have an opportunity to understand members ’ views and to explain their thinking			0
‘ i have therefore asked officers to take the item off the agenda for the full council meeting next week			0
this will give members an opportunity to ask the panel to explain its proposals and , if it sees fit , reconsider them			0

salary would make sir @entity6 the second highest - paid elected mayor in the country , behind only @entity31 , who is on £ 144,000
