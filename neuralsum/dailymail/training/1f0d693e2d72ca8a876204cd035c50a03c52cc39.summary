@entity0 has blamed the @entity1 for the third shut down of its internet and 3g network in a week as the cyber war between the two countries over the @entity8 hack raged on			1
but the apparent reprisal attacks on the secretive state has prompted the western world to ask what effect it had on the people and services of @entity0			1
the answer is simply not much			0
very few of its citizens are connected to the internet in a country where the regime fiercely control any outside influence for fear of sparking dissent			2
but @entity25 has been given a fascinating glimpse into the technology of @entity0 captured during five years of visits from 2008 to 2013			2
they reveal a country wrestling with the need for the knowledge the @entity33 offers , outright propaganda and the desire to its subjugated citizens in their place			0
this @entity0 girl ( right ) asked to use the photograhper 's ipad the mysterious blackouts hit after the @entity1 warned of a retaliation against @entity0 's capital city 's alleged hacking of @entity64			2
the latest , on saturday , came after the @entity0 government called president @entity66 ' a monkey living in a tropical forest ' in a racist rant against the @entity1			1
the @entity70 has accused the rogue state of launching the crippling cyber-attack on @entity8 for producing @entity73 , a comedy that depicts a fictional plot to assassinate the @entity0 's leader @entity75			1
security experts say @entity0 's internet infrastructure is so skeletal that even amateurs - or a simple glitch - could have brought it clattering down			1
most ordinary people in @entity0 have no access to the internet and it is believed there are only 1,000 ip addresses - the label assigned to each device that uses the @entity89 - and these are reserved for trusted @entity90 , the military , some universities , libraries - and presumably the now notorious unit 121 of ' cyber warrior ' group			1
this compares to 112 million in @entity98 or 1.5 billion in the @entity1 ' a large city block in @entity100 or @entity101 would have more ip addresses than @entity0 , ' said @entity103 , a security researcher at @entity105 - based @entity104 the technology can often be seen in the propaganda material such as this school poster ( pictured left )			1
some 20,000 young koreans ( right ) sit facing the spectators at the @entity111 and flip coloured cards to form animated images this man , who has access to a computer , acts as a ' human @entity117 ' there are believed to be about a million computers in @entity0 and everyone who owns a computer must register it			1
they are mainly available at educational and state institutions - but most lack any connection to the world wide web			2
so usb keys and small hard drives that have made their way across the border have become an huge source of information of the world outside country			0
and anyone with a working computer becomes a magnet			0
in 2009 , @entity0 would visit a ' study house ' in the capital @entity141 and ask a man with a computer a question			0
the human @entity146 search engine would then come back with an answer 24 hours later			0
in the @entity149 in @entity141 , officials reckon there is room for 30 million books to be stored , but only a couple of thousand books are available			0
@entity0 people can access a cd library and hear the recordings on big ghetto blasters , but unsurprisingly the choice of @entity159 is not massive			1
you can listen to the radio , or watch tv too but only the national channel because the tuner is also blocked on the local frequency			0
the country has its own desktop operating system called @entity168 , and applications are believed to include @entity170 , games and an engineering calculator , according to @entity173 , a senior writer at @entity174			1
it is claimed that during the early 2000s the regime swapped its @entity178 based operating system for one that looked remarkably like the @entity179 - proving that even dictators fell for the allure of @entity184 ' @entity183			1
all for show : when mr @entity187 asked to see what this girl was doing with her computer , she sat and started to type , but there was no electricity connected : citizens using computers at the @entity149 , @entity141 in 2010 and @entity168 comes with a state - approved folder of desktop wallpapers , including a snowy @entity0 countryside littered with artillery pieces peaking through the foliage			1
even though very few of its inhabitants have any access to a computer , the population is allowed access to an intranet - a countrywide system that is cut off from the rest of the world - called @entity210 , which translates as @entity212			1
but everyone using it is monitored by the authorities and even though guides will tell foreign visitors that it is the internet , you can not connect to any foreign website			0
state - sponsored screen saver : this image , which appears to be photoshopped , depicts the deadly @entity0 countryside desktop wallpaper folder : @entity141 lit up at night , although there are often power outages and rolling blackouts big man : leaders names appear 20 per cent larger than other text which is automatically coded into the script the service is free but it is thought that less than 10 per cent of residents have used it			1
it is estimated there are between 1,000 and 5,000 websites on the intranet , although most of the content is news propaganda , educational and reference materials , and archives , according to @entity174			2
coding also means every time @entity0 's leader 's names are published , they appear 20 per cent larger than the other text on the page			2
the web is also a good way to promote the @entity0 ideology			0
@entity254 ( @entity253 ) website is the major source of information spread to the world , focusing on the activities of @entity75			0
although some companies use email , there will only be one shared address for all of the employees , so there 's no privacy at all			0
more than two million use mobile phones but almost all lack internet connectivity or overseas call features , according to defectors and experts			0
@entity272 at the @entity273 , @entity141 , @entity0			0
citizens are allowed access to the country 's intranet where they can view strictly controlled educational materials computer room in @entity280 where children learn how to use the technology and can access material about their leaders			2

only 1,000 computers are connected to the internet in @entity0 - and those are reserved for trusted *members* of the elite
it has its own operating system - a rip - off of that used on @entity296 computers - called @entity168 with state - approved wallpapers
population can access the intranet - which spews out propaganda - and automatically makes names of leaders 20pc bigger than other words
