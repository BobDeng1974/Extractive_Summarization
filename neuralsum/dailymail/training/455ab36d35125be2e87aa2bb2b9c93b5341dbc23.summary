love them or hate them , emoticons are slowly creeping into more apps , social networks and websites			1
but , not content with using emojis as an addition to your everyday digital conversations , the @entity7 app wants to make all your conversations entirely picture based			1
the @entity15 - based app only lets users communicate using the popular miniature images - and even usernames have to be comprised of a selection of emoticons			1
it only lets users communicate using the popular miniature images - and even usernames have to be comprised of a selection of emoticons			1
meanwhile , the @entity29 keyboard app on @entity30 converts any text into emojis as the user types a study in april found that the top trending word of the year , at that time , was emoji – the small digital images used to express an idea or emotion in electronic communication - which are continuing to spread like wildfire online			1
the words and phrases were plucked from among millions used online in social media , blogs and global media			1
other terms to make the list include ' futebol ’ , and ' ghost plane ' - relating to the missing @entity52 plane			2
the app 's developers , @entity55 and @entity56 , unveiled their plans for @entity58 in july , and more than 10,000 people registered their interest			1
the app is now available , for free , from the @entity62			1
in an introduction video , mr @entity55 and mr @entity56 said : ' we know what you 're thinking			2
' this is satire , no one would actually make this thing			2
' the app has the same blue and white colour scheme as @entity73			1
it has an inbox , settings , and a friend request page			2
currently , users can only search for friends using their username , and it does n't let people find friends via emails , for example			1
mr @entity55 and mr @entity56 said they created the app after being inspired by @entity87 , which allows users to simply send the word @entity87			1
' the two of us had the idea at about the same time - we were n’t sold on it until we realized that usernames should be emoji too , ' @entity55 said			1
' at that point , we burst out laughing and realised we had to build it			2
' @entity99 ( selection pictured ) were originally popular in @entity100 , and widely used online , however , in recent years they have become hugely popular elsewhere			1
originally meaning pictograph , the word emoji literally means ' picture ' ( e ) + ' letter ' ( moji ) earlier this year it was revealed @entity108 is working to expand the diversity of the hugely popular emoji characters for the @entity111			2
following complaints the current character set was not diverse enough , the firm said it was working with the standards body that controls them			0
because emoji have to be displayed on different devices , they are tightly controlled by the @entity120			0
since 2010 a basic list has been developed and maintained by the @entity120 - a @entity122 - based non-profit organisation made up of major computer firms , software producers , user groups and others			0

originally meaning pictograph , the word emoji literally means ' picture ' ( e ) + ' letter ' ( moji )			0
icons are standardised and include some specific to @entity133 culture , such as a bowing ( apologising ) businessman , a face wearing a face mask , a white flower used to denote ' brilliant homework ' or a group of emoji representing popular foods : ramen noodles , dango , onigiri , @entity133 curry , and sushi			0
some emoji character sets have been incorporated into @entity120 , allowing them to be used elsewhere in the world - and more could now be added			0
@entity149 allowed emoji to be used on its web version , as well across its apps , last month			0
it does this to ensure that different devices and mobile carriers can share a basic set			0
the latest disclosure came after @entity108 boss @entity158 was emailed asking if the firm was going to address the issue			0
the diversity of emoji was also questioned in a petition posted to @entity164 calling on @entity108 to increase the ethnic diversity found within its emoji keyboard			0
' of the more than 800 @entity170 , the only two resembling people of color are a guy who looks vaguely @entity172 and another in a turban , ' it says			2
' there 's a white boy , girl , man , woman , elderly man , elderly woman , blonde boy , blonde girl and , we 're pretty sure , [ video game character ] @entity182			0
' a petition suggested that emoji like these could be added to @entity108 's keyboard ' but when it comes to faces outside of yellow smileys , there 's a staggering lack of minority representation			0
' it added that the keyboard already offered a graphic showing a same - sex couple , and called on the company to present people with a wider range of skin tones .			1
