by @entity0 , @entity1 correspondent published : 18:02 est , 29 july 2013 updated : 02:04 est , 30 july 2013 councils will be banned from imposing minimum distance limits that would help protect communities from the scourge of wind farms			1
new planning guidance says local authorities will not be able to designate ‘ buffer zones ’ between properties and turbines			0
the document – from communities secretary @entity13 – said : ‘ distance of itself does not necessarily determine whether the impact of a proposal is unacceptable			1
’ opposed : community secretary @entity13 ( left ) introduces the new guidelines despite planning minister @entity18 ( right ) supporting the idea of buffer zones in his constituency the rules will take effect despite the fact planning minister @entity18 last year said he would like to see such zones implemented in @entity25 , where his constituency is located			1
it is a further blow to anti-wind power campaigners , coming just three months after the @entity29 ruled against @entity30 , which had tried to impose a limit of three quarters of a mile between turbines and homes			1
a judge came down on the side of energy firm @entity37 , whose green division is trying to build two controversial wind farms – including turbines up to 80ft high – close to residential areas			0
critics will be furious ministers have failed to take the opportunity to challenge the court and support buffer zones based on distances			0
but @entity48 and mr @entity13 say @entity50 reforms will give homeowners greater protection than merely rules based on distance , because they will take into account landscape and topography			1
campaigners point out that @entity58 – which generates far more of its energy from wind than the @entity61 – has a legal separation distance of 1.25miles for large turbines			2
guidelines : @entity13 ' new document argues that distance is not always the best measure of where to put wind farms in relation to residential areas speaking after the @entity77 court case , anti-wind farm @entity74 mp @entity73 said : ‘ local residents should be able to have a say on how far wind farms are sited from their homes			1
we do live in a democracy			0
’ he pointed out the case was rejected on a technicality and that the campaign for separation distances would go on			0
unveiling the guidance yesterday , mr @entity13 said it would give communities a greater say on the siting of wind turbines and solar farms			1
‘ the views of local people must be listened to when making planning decisions , ’ he said			0
‘ @entity99 ’s energy needs should not be used to justify the wrong development in the wrong location			0
’ campaigners had been hoping for a stronger line on separation distances after mr @entity18 said in a @entity106 debate last year that buffers ‘ might be appropriate ’ in some areas			2
landscape : the government 's proposal says it takes the topography into account and will stop inappropriate and poorly - placed sites he said he was backing plans by @entity117 to bring in a minimum distance of 1.4miles from residential properties			1
but the smallprint of the new planning guidance specifically rules out buffer zones between wind turbines and houses			0
it says : ‘ local planning authorities should not rule out otherwise acceptable renewable energy developments through inflexible rules on buffer zones or separation distances			0
’ a spokesman for the @entity132 said : ‘ this represents a significant increase in protection for @entity137 ’s heritage and landscape , ensuring that the local environment and local amenity is given the protection it deserves			2
‘ the new guidance allows topography to be taken into account , to stop inappropriate and badly sited wind turbines			2

blow to anti-wind power campaigners who want to impost limits of around three quarters of a mile
number 10 argue their plans take landscape into account more effectively
