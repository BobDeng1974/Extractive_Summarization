by @entity1 reporter @entity5 shooter major @entity3 can continue to represent himself while on trial for killing 13 people during a @entity9 military base shooting rampage , a judge ruled today			1
defense lawyers asked the judge to take over his case on wednesday and the trial was abruptly stopped after just one day in session because one of the attorneys claimed @entity3 was purposefully trying to be convicted and executed			1
but the legal team , who have been helping the @entity21 psychiatrist , not representing him , were told by judge col. @entity22 that @entity3 was only disagreeing on strategy and is fit to stand trial as his own lawyer , @entity17 reported			1
in this courtroom sketch today , maj. @entity26 , second from right , sits with his standby defense attorneys maj. @entity29 , left , and lt. col. @entity30 , second from left , as presiding judge col. @entity22 looks on in this courtroom sketch today , staff sgt. @entity32 , a victim of the @entity5 shootings , testifies during the trial of maj. @entity26 judge @entity22 said : ' standby counsel may not agree with the way the accused is proceeding , but @entity26 determines his strategy , not standby counsel , ' @entity35 reported			1
the standby attorney thinks @entity3 is intentionally trying to get the death sentence for the 2009 rampage			1
lt. col. @entity30 , @entity3 's lead court - appointed standby attorney , said yesterday that he is willing to step in and be @entity3 's defense lawyer but asked that his responsibilities as co-counsel be minimized if @entity3 continues to work toward being executed			1
it is ' clear his goal is to remove impediments or obstacles to the death penalty and is working toward a death penalty , ' @entity30 told the judge overseeing the case at the @entity9 military base			2
@entity3 responded : ' i object			2
that 's a twist of the facts			0
' the judge , col. @entity22 , then cleared the courtroom yesterday			0
ulterior motives : a standby lawyer argued maj. @entity26 ( shown here in court on tuesday ) is trying to blow his defense so that he is sentenced to death blatant : during his brief opening statements on monday , @entity3 said that all of the evidence would show that he was the shooter , and it is unclear how he plans to defend his actions admitted shooter : @entity26 , seen here in 2010 , is representing himself in his own defense as he faces the death penalty for allegedly killing 13 people on @entity79 base in 2009 on tuesday , he told jurors during a less than two - minute opening statement that the evidence would ' clearly show ' he was the shooter , but that it would ' only show one side			1
' he also questioned only two of the first dozen witnesses , who included one soldier who was shot seven times during the november 2009 attack on the sprawling @entity21 post			1
@entity3 is charged with 13 counts of premeditated murder and 32 counts of attempted premeditated murder			1
if convicted , he would face the death penalty			0
@entity30 said @entity3 was acting as his own attorney in a way that , ' we believe is repugnant to defense counsel and contrary to our professional obligations			2
' @entity3 repeatedly asked the judge to allow him to explain why @entity30 's claim was wrong , saying : ' your honor , col. @entity30 has made an assertion that is inaccurate			2
i 'd like to clarify that			0
' @entity22 paused for nearly half minute before asking that @entity3 explain his argument in writing			2
he said he would n't do that			0
@entity22 then closed the courtroom to discuss the matter			0
no witnesses were called wednesday			0
@entity3 , an @entity116 - born muslim who was paralyzed after being shot by officers responding to the attack , said he was as a soldier who switched sides in what he described as a war between @entity116 and his @entity125 faith			1
@entity3 wanted to plead guilty to murder and attempted murder , but military rules forbid guilty pleas in death penalty cases			0
precautions : armed guards ( seen here tuesday ) surround the courthouse on the @entity9 military base high security : all cars are being checked for explosives as @entity5 is operating under extreme caution during the trial @entity3 had also asked to argue that he carried out the shooting in ' defense of others , ' namely members of the @entity145 fighting in @entity146 , but the judge denied that strategy			1
his defense strategy still remains unclear			0
during tuesday 's testimony , he occasionally took notes on a legal pad			0
while two defense attorneys remained on stand - by , @entity3 rarely turned to them for advice			2
no @entity116 soldier has been executed since 1961 , and military prosecutors showed that they would take no chance of fumbling details that could jeopardize any conviction down the line			0
connected : the government has said that @entity3 , a @entity116 - born @entity162 , had sent more than a dozen emails starting in december 2008 to @entity164 , a radical @entity116 - born @entity125 cleric killed by a drone strike in @entity166 the long - delayed trial was years in the making after judges in the case had granted a series of delays			1
a fight over @entity3 's beard , which violates military regulations , led to a stay shortly before his trial was expected to begin last year and eventual replacement of the judge			2
the trial is playing out amid high security at @entity5 , where armed guards stood in doorways and 15 - foot stacks of shock - absorbing barriers obscured the view of the courthouse			0
jurors were told to prepare for a trial that could take months , and @entity3 , who is in a wheelchair , needs regular breaks .			0

maj. @entity26 is charged with killing 13 people in november 2009 shooting rampage inside @entity79 base
was working as an @entity21 psychiatrist but had been *communicating* with a radical cleric in @entity166 for a year before the shooting
@entity3 , now paralyzed after being shot in the back by first responders during the attack , will be representing himself without the help of a lawyer
judge already ruled that he could not say he opened fire ' in defense of others ' , as he argued that he was *saving* the @entity145 in @entity146
