with their wide , springy gait , ostriches can reach speeds of 40mph in a single stride			0
as a child , @entity4 was fascinated by what appeared to be the effortless speed and agility of these creatures , making them the fastest running birds on the planet			1
now the @entity14 - based inventor has created a prototype gadget that he claims will allow humans to experience what it ’s like to reach these incredible speeds			1
mr @entity4 has been working on the boots for several years , and has already produced dozens of prototypes			1
last month , he took his bionic boots to the @entity33 in @entity34 to demonstrate its capabilities			0
in its current form , the device can reach speeds of up to 25 mph ( 40 km / h ) – or the same speed as a slow - moving car			2
dubbed the ‘ @entity22 ’ , the shoes have springs on the back designed to imitate the @entity25 of an ostrich or kangaroo , giving the wearer more down force when running 3d - printed limbs and hands controlled by apps becoming mainstream 3d - printed limbs and hands controlled by apps becoming mainstream gone are the days of solid rubber prosthetics			1
from 3d - printed limbs to titanium legs and hands controlled by apps , advances in technology are revolutionising the industry			2
earlier this year , a new state - of - the - art centre has opened in @entity63 to give specialist treatment to military amputees - taking advantage of these developments , and making the technology more mainstream			2
the service is based at the @entity72 unit at @entity73 , and at the @entity74 in @entity75			2
patients in @entity77 , @entity78 and @entity79 will be able to access services via video link - up			2
the units will run alongside the existing @entity84 prosthetics service , and use specialist prosthetic training and imaging equipment to manufacture new socket technology			0
the centre also features a gait laboratory that will study how well patients are walking with their new limbs			0
mr @entity4 has been working on the boots for several years , and has already produced dozens of prototypes according to @entity93 , mr @entity4 says wo n’t rest until he can go faster and outrun some of @entity95 ’s fastest land animals			1
and he is n’t the first to attempt the gait of an ostrich or kangaroo			0
for instance the £ 166 ( $ 265 ) bouncing boots claims to turn anyone into a human kangaroo			0
the ‘ @entity106 ’ are fastened like roller blades or ski boots , with quick - release buckles			0
once they ’re on , you need to do a little march on the spot to get yourself used to the sensation , which feels rather like jogging on a trampoline			0
featuring a spring - loaded sole , the mini-trampolines were initially invented to help people recover from sports injuries by taking away the impact of running on their joints			1
but now they ’re being sold as a way of enjoying all the benefits of a tough gym or aerobics workout			0
as a child , @entity4 ( right ) was fascinated by what appeared to be the effortless speed and agility of ostriches			1
now the @entity14 - based inventor has created a prototype gadget that he claims will allow humans to experience what it ’s like to reach these incredible speeds the @entity106 were featured in the hit reality tv show made in @entity137 when two of the glossy young stars , @entity140 and @entity141 , were filmed jogging in them beside the @entity142			1

prototype developed by @entity14 - based inventor , @entity4
shoes have springs on the back that imitate @entity25 of an ostrich
the springs provides the wearer with more down force when running
