by @entity0 published : 06:16 est , 13 january 2014 updated : 11:41 est , 13 january 2014 ordeal : @entity3 was raped by her father when she was 12 a young woman who was raped by her father at the age of 12 has shared her story in the hope it will help other victims of sexual abuse			1
@entity11 , now 21 , from @entity12 , revealed her father , @entity13 , had always been controlling but took his abuse further after he split up with her mother			1
she said : ' he started to sexually abuse me when i stayed with him and it went on for over a year			2
he was very manipulative and controlled my thoughts to make me believe it was normal			0
' the first time he raped me he said afterwards , " well it was better that it was with me than with some random person in a hotel "			2
' @entity3 said she did n't realise what her father was doing was wrong and it took her years to pluck up the courage to reveal she was a victim of abuse			1
she explains : ' my mum had n't spoken to me about sexual abuse and what type of touching was acceptable and what was n't			1
it took me two years to tell someone i was being abused as i did n't realise it was wrong at first and then , when i did , i did n't know how to broach the subject with my mum			1
' as a result of her ordeal , @entity3 is now supporting a campaign by the @entity41 - who supported her as she came to terms with her experiences			1
the charity have launched a campaign called pants that encourages parents to have simple , age appropriate conversations with their children to make them aware of the dangers of sexual abuse			1
@entity47 stands for ' privates are private ' , ' always remember your body belongs to you ' , @entity53 means no ' , ' talk about secrets that upset you ' and ' speak up someone can help '			0
do n't suffer in silence : the @entity41 campaign encourages parents to tell their children not to keep things that upset them secret ( posed by model ) they advise parents to tell primary school children of the ' underwear rule ' - that they should n't be touched by anyone else in the areas their underwear covers			1
it 's something @entity3 wishes she had been taught at a young age			1
she said : ' i think for me to have known that what was happening was wrong my mum would have needed to have said , " you should n't let people touch you in areas that your underwear would cover " so i knew what was acceptable and what was n't			2
' i 'd had sex education at school when i was younger but that was just about safe sex and i think a girl should be told about what constitutes sexual abuse by her mum not teachers			1
' help : @entity3 finally confided in her mother and the family were supported by the @entity41 and her father was jailed it was after she finally confided in her mother that @entity3 's abuse at the hands of her father finally ended and he was arrested , charged and eventually jailed for nine years			1
@entity3 explained : ' telling my mum about the abuse was the worst conversation of my life			0
' i sat down with her and could n't get it out at first			0
then i was just really blunt and blurted it out			0
mum was shocked and started crying and we all sat crying together			0
' but despite @entity13 being behind bars , @entity3 's ordeal was far from over as she had to cope with the aftermath of his abuse , something she eventually learnt to deal with thanks to the @entity41 's help			1
she said : ' @entity13 was arrested and our family was in bits			2
@entity102 blamed herself and there was lots of arguing			0
i felt broken and suicidal and was self harming			0
i was drinking constantly and did n't care what i did			0
' i had lots of social workers but they did n't stick around so when i was introduced to a worker from the @entity41 i told her i did n't like her			1
but she stuck with me and was always there for me			0
she made me realise a lot of things about myself and helped me understand why i was acting out and helped me work through it			0
' i 'm better now and love my life but i think that if i 'd spoken out and stopped the abuse earlier and gotten help earlier i would have recovered more quickly			2
' @entity130 , from @entity131 , who has a seven year old daughter said following the advice of the @entity47 campaign has given her more peace of mind			0
moved on : but @entity3 wishes she has spoken out earlier about the sexual abuse she said : ' we had a great discussion , without fear or embarrassment about @entity142 and what she must do should she ever find herself in that position			1
i feel confident that should my daughter find herself in such a position ( which fingers crossed never happens ) , she 'll be able to address the issue in an informed manner and without fear of repercussion			0
' another mother , @entity152 , from @entity153 , who has a son , aged five , agreed : ' it was a difficult subject to approach with my son , but using the @entity142 and the materials provided by the @entity41 gave me the confidence to start having these conversations with him			2
' @entity161 , from @entity162 , who has two young girls added : ' i think this education campaign is a great idea			2
i have two daughters and when i watch the news i really fear for them			0
but i worry about spoiling their innocence ; frightening them and making them feel they ca n't be normal around people			0
' i know i have to prepare them for those times i am not with them and that they are more likely to be abused by someone they know , so i have tried to start talking to my girls but i worry that i might say the wrong thing or that they will start to ask questions i ca n't or do n't want to answer ! any advice on what to say and how to cope with such a sensitive but important subject is great			2
' i am going to start talking pants to my girls , my goddaughter , nephew and all my friends with children - it 's much better to talk to our kids about how they can be safe rather than how awful the last report about a child suffering abuse was on the news and now i have got some help to do it well			1
