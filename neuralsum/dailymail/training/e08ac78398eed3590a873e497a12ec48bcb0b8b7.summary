by @entity0 published : 18:29 est , 12 january 2014 updated : 05:12 est , 13 january 2014 prime minister @entity2 has been warned that he will foster division in the party if he ignores the views of eurosceptics @entity2 was branded ‘ absolutely out of touch ’ with the @entity4 last night after he dismissed calls to give @entity8 a veto over @entity11 law			1
the prime minister was told he risked causing disastrous divisions in the party , including a @entity15 split , after a letter from 95 backbenchers demanding the right to say no to @entity20 legislation was branded unrealistic			1
eurosceptics reacted furiously last night , saying the prime minister would be ‘ bonkers ’ to ignore their views and warning that @entity4 high command was heading for an ‘ almighty smash - up ’ with the rest of the party			1
the row is expected to intensify on wednesday when chancellor @entity28 makes a speech arguing that @entity30 should remain within a reformed @entity11			1
the number of rebels calling for a veto on new @entity11 laws – and the power to repeal existing ones that threaten @entity30 ’s national interests – dwarfs the 81 mps who voted against the government on @entity20 in 2011			1
the letter was signed by almost two thirds of the 158 backbenchers not given jobs by mr @entity2			2
the rebels say at least six @entity15 members also back them , plus six ministerial aides and members of mr @entity2 ’s policy board , making the true figure 107 mps or more			2
one signatory said : ‘ if @entity52 digs in over this they are absolutely bonkers			2
they will create a @entity15 split			2
this is a wake - up call			2
if the governing elite of our party are so absolutely out of touch it ’s going to be absolutely disastrous			2
’ at the moment , mr @entity2 can only veto new laws on the most sensitive issues such as defence and the @entity11 budget			1
but while @entity8 can raise concerns with the @entity66 , it has no powers to block or repeal existing laws			2
the rebels call on mr @entity2 to ‘ make the idea of a national veto over current and future @entity11 laws a reality ’ and ‘ enable @entity8 to disapply @entity11 legislation , where it is in our vital national interests to do so ’			1
the mps point out that this ‘ would transform the @entity30 ’s negotiating position in the @entity11 ’ as mr @entity2 seeks to carve out a new relationship with @entity80 ahead of an in - out referendum in 2017			1
@entity82 says the unemployment will soar and the @entity30 economy will be hit hard by a veto but foreign secretary @entity82 warned the veto would undermine the single market and damage business			1
he told @entity89 : ‘ if national parliaments were unilaterally just able to choose which bits of @entity11 law they would apply and which bits they would n’t , the @entity20 single market would n’t work			1
we have to be realistic			2
’ justice secretary @entity95 said he understood the @entity76 ’ concerns but a ‘ red card ’ system could work only if several countries got together to oppose @entity11 laws			1
@entity101 , who co-ordinated the letter , said europhiles overestimate the economic damage that could be caused if the @entity30 renegotiates its relationship with the @entity11 he added : ‘ i do n’t think it ’s realistic to have a situation where one @entity8 can veto laws across the @entity11			1
’ but irate mps accused senior @entity110 of peddling a policy that was ‘ indistinguishable from that of the @entity113 ’			0
they warned mr @entity28 not to use the argument advanced by @entity113 leader @entity115 – that leaving the @entity11 could cost three million jobs – when he speaks to the @entity118 think - tank and the @entity120 group on wednesday			1
the chancellor is expected to urge @entity11 nations to change their economic approach to copy @entity30 ’s growth , but signal that the @entity30 wants to stay in if the @entity11 reforms itself			1
@entity101 , who coordinated the letter , said : ‘ we ’re all being very polite to each other but i think it ’s better if we have some honest disagreements on the future of @entity20 rather than pretending we agree			0
‘ it ’s the facile tactics @entity134 always use			0
they start talking about three million jobs as if the sky is going to fall in if we ask for some powers back			0
’ @entity137 , another signatory , said many rebels do n’t even want the single market , adding : ‘ if this makes the single market not work , that ’s not the problem			0
we can still have free trade , which is more important			0
laws should be made by our democratic representatives , not by the fiat of @entity80			0
’ signatories include @entity150 , @entity151 , @entity152 , @entity153 and ex-defence minister sir @entity154			0
one said : ‘ @entity52 ’s argument is such rubbish			0
we are at crunch point			0
they are heading for the most almighty smash - up			0
’ they said mr @entity2 had nothing to lose by making the veto @entity4 policy because the pro-european wing of the @entity4 was so depleted			2
one added : ‘ would the party be split ? i do n’t think so			0
’ @entity20 's ‘ travelling circus ’ , in which @entity169 decamp to @entity170 once a month , costs taxpayers at least £ 93million a year			0
@entity11 figures show the astonishing price of packing up the parliament in @entity80 and shipping it to @entity174 for just four days each month			1
conservative meps estimated the true cost to be £ 130million – and called for an end to the practice			0
some £ 250,000 is spent just lugging paperwork between the two cities , a report on the ‘ financial and environmental impact ’ showed			0
maintaining the parliament in @entity174 costs £ 50million a year			0
although @entity169 voted to scrap the ‘ circus ’ by three to one last year , the @entity170 will veto any such attempt			2
conservative mep @entity186 said : ‘ this craziness has to stop			0
’ @entity137 says the @entity30 does n't need the single market , as free trade is more important mr @entity115 warned the letter showed the @entity110 were drifting towards the exit in @entity20 , which would lead to ‘ economic suicide ’ for @entity30			1
he said the @entity4 signatories were ‘ cowering behind the cliffs of @entity202 ’ , adding : ‘ conservative mps need to make up their mind			0
if they want full exit from the @entity11 , they should be free to argue it , but then they should come clean because what they ’re saying is they want to be part of a @entity20 club but do n’t want to play by the rules			1
’ a @entity205 spokesman said : ‘ we will study this idea , but we need to look at what it would mean in practice			0
if national parliaments unilaterally overturned @entity11 laws , the single market would n’t work			1

@entity214 warned it would be ' bonkers ' to ignore views of eurosceptics
95 backbenchers demanded to right to say no to @entity11 legislation
@entity82 says veto would harm @entity30 economy and create unemployment
