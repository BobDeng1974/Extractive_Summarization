by @entity0 published : 08:40 est , 19 september 2013 updated : 13:31 est , 19 september 2013 down in the mouth : @entity2 has lived alone since his partner @entity4 died , but is too old to live with anyone else a zoo which was inundated with visitors worried about their lonely - looking chimp has had to put a sign up to reassure guests that he is just missing his mate			1
families with young children visiting @entity15 and @entity16 , in @entity17 , @entity18 , have been worried that chimpanzee @entity19 might be severely unwell			1
but keepers have insisted the glum - looking ape is suffering from a broken heart after his life - partner @entity24 died of natural causes seven years ago			1
the pair were said to have been inseparable after spending 45 years together at the zoo since they arrived within a year of each other in 1968 and 1969			2
after @entity24 died , staff at the zoo looked into pairing up her dejected partner with another chimp , but were advised by primate specialists that he would be better off staying in the home he had known for so long			2
a zoo spokesman said : ' we decided that rather than attempt to introduce him to a new group , the best course of action for @entity19 was to remain at @entity43 , the only home he has ever known , in the care of keepers who know and love him			1
' he said @entity24 lived alone because it would not be safe to introduce a single , elderly animal into a new group			0
a sign has now been erected outside @entity19 ’s enclosure informing zoo visitors of the reasons behind the grieving 47 - year - old ’s downcast demeanour			1
it explains why the zoo took the decision to keep @entity19 in an enclosure by himself , saying : ' we took the decision to let him live out his remaining days here in the place he knew well with the staff who had looked after him from a youngster			2
@entity2 lived with his mate @entity24 ( pictured ) from 1969 until she died in 2005			0
since then he has lived alone ' we did not feel trying to introduce a new partner was the the answer , as when he eventually dies we would be left in the same situation			0
' we fully understand that not everyone agrees with our decision , but we stand by it and have the support of our licensing authority and zoo inspectors			0
today families visiting the zoo said they were sad to learn why the chimp looks so down in the mouth			0
' not an easy decision to make ' : staff at the zoo have put up a sign to explain why the sad chimp is alone @entity19 and @entity4 would preen each other and share their toys and beds in their joint enclosure @entity96 , 30 , who was with her daughter @entity97 , five , said : ' while it ’s good to hear that he is not seriously ill , the story behind his depression is still absolutely heartbreaking			1
' his eyes look tinged with sadness - he looks really down in the dumps			0
' @entity106 , 30 , who had taken her niece @entity107 , seven , to the theme park , added : ' you ’ve got to feel sorry for old @entity2			0
' the zoo spokesman said keepers were told to make a special effort to keep @entity19 from dwelling on his sadness , coming up with games and activities to keep him busy			0
. head keeper @entity120 , who has looked after @entity19 for 30 years , said : ' @entity19 and @entity4 used to preen each other a lot , share toys and beds - they were in the same enclosure together .			1
