@entity0 , @entity1 , @entity2 and @entity3			0
now there are just four of the @entity6 minnows who have surpassed @entity8 by making it to the fifth round in recent seasons			1
not since 2006 – in a @entity13 era – have the @entity11 progressed beyond the fourth round			0
you can add @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 to a list of lower - league teams who have outshone @entity13 ’s @entity8 in a competition they have won six times			2
indeed , their tradition and history is best illustrated by the @entity6 and the team of the 1950s – led by @entity30 – who lifted the famous trophy three times in five years			2
@entity33 scored the only goal of the game as @entity8 were dumped out of the @entity6 @entity37 goalkeeper @entity36 is hopeless to stop the first goal of the game at the @entity39 today , however , they are the only football club in the land who have gone on record in deprioritising the 144 - year - old competition			1
such policy has certainly been played out on the pitch			0
in fact , no top - flight club better – or worse - demonstrates the demise of the @entity6 and its relevance in a climate where the @entity53 cash cow is the only competition worth milking			2
since gaining promotion back to the top division in 2010 , @entity8 have won just one @entity6 match			1
they have been eliminated by @entity2 , @entity59 ( twice ) , @entity60 and @entity61			2
twice they have made seven changes for a third - round defeat and twice they have made five			0
on saturday , during the sorry 1 - 0 surrender at @entity61 in which star players @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity72 were rested by caretaker boss @entity73 , supporters made their feelings known – ‘ we ’re s * * * t and we ’re sick of it ’ was the terrace put - down , followed by disgust when they waved their own players away as they attempted to applaud a 4,300 - strong following			1
@entity8 players look dejected after the final whistle as @entity83 applauds the travelling fans @entity8 fans shout abuse at their team at the end of the @entity90 match the @entity8 have had enough			1
their team are tenth in the table , 10 points clear of the relegation zone , seemingly needing just 13 more to hit 40 and renew their @entity53 status and , more importantly from a boardroom perspective , bolster the owner ’s bank balance for one more season at least			0
why , then , did they so brazenly disrespect this season ’s @entity6 ? club legend @entity100 said he was ‘ annoyed , angry and surprised ’ when @entity101 named a weakened side in last year ’s third round , while @entity104 , who played 337 times for @entity8 and was at @entity61 on saturday , is another former favourite who can not understand the approach			1
‘ it ’s baffling why they do not value the cups when they ’re in the position they are in the league , ’ he told @entity107			0
‘ i was at the game on saturday and so were more than 4,000 @entity8 fans and i could not believe the team when i heard it - it ’s taking a lend of fans when they ’ve paid good money to be there			1
@entity73 made a raft of changes for the @entity6 third round clash against @entity61 ‘ they were n’t happy and they had every right not to be			1
it was like a practice match and , to be honest , neither team wanted to win it			0
‘ @entity61 would have been just as happy to get beat you feel			1
but they ’re fighting to stay in the league and you can understand their changes to a degree – their priority is survival			0
‘ but @entity8 only need another three or four wins and they ’ll be fine			2
so now you ’re left with a scenario where the season is pretty much over in january			0
‘ what are they playing for ? to finish as high as possible in the league ? well you ’d even doubt that because the @entity141 is just as much as a distraction to them as the @entity6			2
’ @entity104 himself only made it to the fifth round on three occasions during 10 years on @entity148			0
but the former @entity150 international says there was never a question of certain competitions taking precedence			0
@entity104 played 377 times for @entity8 and was at @entity61 on saturday for the @entity6 match @entity104 ( above ) was critical of the team picked by @entity73 and said fans have every right to be unhappy ‘ listen , our record in the @entity6 was n’t great , but it was n’t for the want of trying , we just were n’t good enough , ’ he said			1
‘ we named our strongest side in every match and i appreciate things have changed in that respect , but clubs like @entity8 and those around them in the @entity53 should be having a right good go at the cups			0
‘ they are n’t going to get in the top four , they are n’t going down and they ’ve got supporters who work hard all week and follow them all over the country in their thousands			0
‘ @entity8 are n’t the only ones guilty of this but it ’s killing the cup and you end up with matches like saturday which just feel like an inconvenience for both teams			1
’ there , in one word , @entity104 captures the sad slide of the @entity6 – has it really become an inconvenience ?			1
