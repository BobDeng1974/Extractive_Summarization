a young female prison officer who exchanged love letters containing ' sexual innuendos ' with two inmates , including a murderer serving a life sentence , has been jailed			1
@entity6 , who is from a family of prison guards , forged close relationships with two male prisoners at work and then kept in touch with them through letters			1
she was exposed after police were called in following an internal investigation into the 25 - year - old 's conduct , after a prisoner alluded to the pair having a sexual relationship			1
a search of her bedroom led to a number of letters being found , which showed she was in contact with a man she had met during the course of her job , who was jailed for life in 2009 for murder			1
prisoner officer @entity6 was sentenced to 12 months in prison for breach of a trusted position after her suggestive love letters to two inmates were discovered prosecuting , @entity38 said the letters contained ' sexual innuendos ' and ' romantic overtures '			1
one letter written by @entity6 and dated june 1 , 2012 , had never been sent but showed she was ' receptive of his interest			1
' ms @entity38 said : ' she writes as if they were friends			0
they have something special , that they can work through things , that she loves him			2
' @entity52 heard that @entity6 poured her heart out about problems she was having with her current boyfriend			1
the familiarity and detail in a letter dated june 16 , 2012 showed that the pair ' must have spent considerable time together and got to know each other well , ' added ms @entity38			0
' it tells of the sex they will have and it tells of reciprocated love			0
' @entity6 got to know the prisoner when she worked at young offenders institution @entity67 , in @entity69 , south - east @entity70 , between 2010 and 2012 @entity6 had got to know the prisoner when she worked at young offenders institution @entity67 , in @entity69 , south - east @entity70 , between 2010 and 2012 , the court was told			1
after this time , she would go to @entity73 , to meet the prisoner 's brother to collect letters he had written to her and the brother 's phone number was found in her phone under a pseudonym when her phone was searched by police			1
ms @entity38 said that this in itself represented a further offence , as the brother had also served jail time and it was against the law for prison officers to be in contact with former prisoners			2
citing the letters ' content as damning proof of the inappropriate relationship between guard and prisoner , ms @entity38 said : ' there are clear expressions of love and the future that they will have together			1
' however , @entity103 , defending , said it was absurd to seriously consider a future with a man serving a life sentence			0
' in my submission , they show the immaturity of mrs @entity6 and are probably indicative of a fantasy , ' she said			2
' it is simply a false fantasy rather than a meaningful bond			0
' ms @entity103 continued : ' mrs @entity6 accepts that she displayed extraordinary stupidity			2
she accepts she foolishly , wilfully , misconducted herself			0
she accepts that is inexcusable			0
' she has maintained throughout there has been no physical contact			0
' @entity6 was also said to have had an inappropriate relationship with a prisoner serving a five year jail term for firearms offences			1
this prisoner had two periods of ' overlap ' with @entity6 , serving time in @entity67 from august 2011 and in @entity127 from february 2012 , when @entity6 was employed there			1
this prisoner had two periods of ' overlap ' with @entity6 , serving time in @entity67 , which is part of high - security prison @entity132 , pictured , and in @entity127 from february 2012 a letter from this inmate to @entity6 was intercepted in the @entity138 men 's prison in @entity139 , @entity140 in 2012 , in which the prisoner referred to their relationship as ' our little thing , ' and made clear his sexual intentions			1
a further letter was found from him in the stash of nine letters in @entity6 's bedroom , understood to have been taken out of prison by her			1
prosecutors insisted @entity6 had been trained to report such matters to her superiors			2
basic prison training included how to interact with prisoners , avoid cohesive behaviour from inmates , and how to report any conflicts of interest			0
the young guard had reported several such conflicts when she recognised an inmate from school and another through family links			2
' from 2012 this defendant was fully aware of the rules and was capable of declaring conflicts of interest , ' ms @entity38 said			0
disciplinary proceedings were started against @entity6 last year after allegations of improper conduct , including allegations she had smuggling phones and drugs into prison			2
suspicions had been aroused after the inmate who wrote her letters at @entity127 was caught with mobile phones three times in six months			1
rumours were even circulating in the prison that @entity6 was a prostitute after one inmate made allegations of a sexual nature against the young guard , the court heard , but she always denied these claims and none were proceeded with by the @entity190			1
@entity6 resigned from @entity127 amid the scandal in august 2013 , when her misconduct was discovered by detectives			2
ms @entity103 said the former guard from @entity195 , @entity196 , had married her long - term love , who had stuck with her throughout and with whom she had a seven - month old baby			0
he had written a heartfelt letter to the judge in support of his wife although it was not read to the court			0
@entity6 was now pregnant with their second child , ms @entity103 added , and had the full support of her parents , who both had long careers as prison guards themselves			2
the devastated couple sat in the court 's public gallery , wiping their eyes as they watched their daughter crying in the dock			0
@entity6 broke into hysterical sobs when judge @entity219 told her he would be handing her a custodial sentence for her breach of a trusted position			1
sentencing her to 12 months in prison , judge @entity219 told @entity6 she would serve half that sentence , so would be out before she was due to give birth			1
' i 've been told that your parents are or were prison officers , ' he said			0
' it must be very sad for them to see you in your current position			0
' so it 's a case of you receiving letters from a prisoner at @entity67 , not reporting them			1
' you met his brother			0
you should n't have done that and you should have reported it			0
' these were the inappropriate relationships you had in your position			2
' judge @entity219 continued : ' the integrity of each officer is of paramount importance			0
something like this , of course , reflects on others with whom you work			0
' there must be an immediate term of imprisonment			0
there must be an element of deterrent			0
' sobbing hysterically as she was told to change roles from guard to prisoner and go down to the cells , @entity6 looked at her devastated parents in horror , crying out , ' i love you , i 'm sorry			1
