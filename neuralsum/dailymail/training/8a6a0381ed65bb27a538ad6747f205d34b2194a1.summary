here was one encounter with @entity1 when @entity2 would have been more justified in rattling off a few expletives			1
last month @entity2 was given a touchline ban after letting rip at one of his club ’s fans when provoked during his side ’s 3 - 1 defeat at home by @entity1			1
on sunday , @entity12 ’s manager remained rather restrained , calling only for the introduction of video technology to avoid the kind of decisions that proved so costly to his struggling side			2
but the first of two penalties that were awarded to @entity1 would have angered any manager at @entity21 , given that @entity22 punished @entity23 for handball when @entity26 ’s cross struck the @entity12 captain square in the face			1

goals : @entity40 58 , @entity49 60 manager : @entity2 referee : @entity22 5 attendance : 44,720 man of the match : @entity81 @entity49 equalised for @entity12 - click here for our brilliant @entity97 service @entity31 ’s two penalties took @entity1 ’s goal tally from the spot to 100 in the @entity102 , more than any other side have managed			1
any sense of injustice was softened for @entity2 by the response from his players : two stunning second - half goals from @entity40 and @entity49 in less than two minutes that underlined just how well they performed			1
but when a team sits bottom they need wins , not draws , and @entity2 will regard this as two points lost rather than one gained			0
it was one of those games that leaves both managers feeling a little bruised ; the frustration for @entity29 his side ’s failure to build on the momentum of successive victories			0
if @entity29 thought his side had turned a corner with that dynamic display against @entity128 on monday night , they seemed to run into a bit of a dead end again here			0
@entity61 delivered another fine attacking performance but as a team @entity1 certainly lacked the flair and pace of that 4 - 1 demolition of @entity128 , instead showing the usual defensive frailties that explain why they are conceding as many goals as they score this season			1
@entity23 was adjudged to have handled when @entity26 's cross smacked him in the face inside the area @entity22 gave @entity1 a penalty for this incident , despite the @entity12 captain 's hands being by his side the @entity12 players surrounded the official after @entity1 were given a penalty in the first half @entity61 slides a ball past @entity152 midfielder @entity151 as @entity1 took charge from the off @entity29 acknowledged his players made ‘ too many mistakes ’ , even if he also complained of ‘ fatigue ’ in this busy @entity159 period			1
it will give him no pleasure to learn that this was only the third time in the @entity102 that @entity1 have thrown away a two - goal lead			1
buoyed by a first win in 99 days last weekend , @entity12 started this encounter in some style			2
they were the better team and , had the excellent @entity81 been more accurate with his finishing , could have been ahead			0
after little more than a minute @entity81 had seen a free kick bounce off a stranded @entity56 ’s left - hand post and the @entity170 should have scored a few minutes later when @entity49 escaped @entity171			1
@entity81 sent his close - range shot both high and wide			0
a @entity1 side strengthened by the return of @entity31 but short of goalscoring options , with @entity176 not even on the bench bceause of injury , according to a club spokesman , offered little until that controversial 17th - minute penalty			1
@entity61 sparked the move that led to the incident that so incensed @entity12 , sending @entity26 clear with a marvellous pass			2
but @entity23 did everything you might expect from a captain and central defender , moving swiftly to recover the ground on the young @entity189 forward and launching himself to block the shot			0
for showing such courage and athleticism @entity23 really deserved better			0
@entity193 was so angry he described it on @entity195 as the ‘ worst decision ever ’ ; a measure as much of his passion for @entity12 as a referee ’s incompetence			2
@entity61 was barged in the back by @entity12 defender @entity202 as @entity12 tried to find a way back into the game @entity79 slides in to nip the ball off @entity1 winger @entity26 but the hosts were too much for @entity2 's side @entity176 ( centre ) watches on glum - faced in the stands alongside goalkeeper @entity210 @entity78 hunts down @entity35 as @entity12 managed to get themselves a foothold in the game after the break the @entity12 substitutes run to join in with the wild celebrations after equalising in the 60th minute hapless referee @entity22 started the new year as he refereed throughout the old one by awarding @entity1 a penalty when the ball appeared to hit @entity12 's @entity23 on the head as he slid to block @entity26 's cross			1
@entity22 clearly thought that the ball had hit the arm of @entity23 but replays showed that was not the case			0
referees are told that it can be understandable if they miss incidents but it is not acceptable to give something that has not happened			0
@entity81 would threaten again with a free kick that was deflected over @entity56 ’s crossbar but with @entity61 very much at the centre of things @entity1 were playing with more purpose			0
@entity35 went close and when @entity61 darted into the area and attempted to lift the ball into the path of his advancing team - mates , @entity202 foolishly halted its progress with an outstretched hand			0
@entity2 thought it harsh as well but this time @entity22 got it right			2
it was handball and @entity31 struck again , six minutes before the break			2
from a corner @entity1 then tried something rather more spectacular , with @entity35 inviting @entity34 to try his luck with a volley from outside the 18 - yard box			2
@entity34 connected beautifully , but his effort whistled just wide			0
the first half concluded with @entity2 talking to a police officer who was patrolling the technical area			0
he joked afterwards that he had not been arrested			0
after the break @entity60 very nearly increased @entity1 ’s lead , but with the loss of @entity35 to a thigh injury after 55 minutes came a slight loss of impetus			2
within four minutes @entity12 had scored , @entity82 chesting a ball forward from @entity78 into the path of @entity40 and inviting the former @entity189 striker to score with a spectacular hitch - kick style half - volley			1
no sooner had the game restarted than @entity12 struck again , with @entity49 guiding a left - foot shot from outside the penalty area past can and beyond @entity56 , who for some reason did not even move			1
further opportunities would follow for both sides , with @entity22 opting not to award another penalty against @entity23 for a challenge on @entity63			0
if he was feeling more generous towards @entity23 after that first - half error , it was the least @entity12 deserved .			1

@entity22 awarded @entity1 two *questionable* penalties in the first half
@entity31 scored from the spot twice as the @entity36 were two up at half - time
but @entity40 and then @entity49 scored after the break to draw @entity12 level
