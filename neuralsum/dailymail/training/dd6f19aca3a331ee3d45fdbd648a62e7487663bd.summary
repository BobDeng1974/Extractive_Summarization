staffordshire police are now investigating the threats after mr @entity2 passed on the tweets to officers - but @entity4 has refused to comment on the case , saying that users can report abuse whenever it occurs			1
outspoken : @entity2 has accused @entity4 of not doing enough to tackle racist and abusive messages the @entity22 striker , who also played for @entity23 and @entity24 , claims he has repeatedly been subjected to online racism since joining @entity4			1
yesterday he tweeted : ' i accuse @entity4 directly of not doing enough to combat racist / homophobic / sexist hate messages , all of which are illegal in the @entity30			1
' in the last 24 hours i 've been threatened with murder several times , demeaned on my race , and many of these accounts are still active			0
why ? ' the 43 - year - old then shared a number of appalling messages he was sent after criticising @entity40 striker @entity39 , with some web users calling him the n - word and using offensive racial stereotypes			1
anger : the former footballer blames the @entity47 - based web giant for failing to stop the flood of vile messages claims : mr @entity2 has repeatedly been targeted by racist trolls and has even received death threats appearing on @entity54 's breakfast programme this morning , mr @entity2 said : ' the age user range of @entity4 has gone down dramatically			1
' i am seeing gangs of kids from 10 to 18 goaded by adults to make racist and homophobic and sexist insults on @entity4 , so @entity4 need to deal with it			2
' today 's my birthday and i would rather not be here but i am going to try to talk about this issue			0
nothing seems to be done			0
@entity4 are now hiding behind , " we do n't discuss individual cases			2

' asked how he responded to the abusive messages , the ex-footballer said : ' i retweet , i report , i block and if it is sufficiently threatening , i will go to the police			1
abuse : police have launched an investigation over this message , which mr @entity2 retweeted to his followers call to action : mr @entity2 has received dozens of messages of support from his followers ' i have been on it for six years now and it 's a fantastic tool to engage in my sport , football , with fans			1
' if you disagree with a point that i make it 's absolutely fine			0
but i should n't be racially abused for it , i should n't have somebody that tweets me two days ago saying i am going to turn up at your house and murder you			0
' when mr @entity2 appeared on @entity97 today , a presenter suggested that trolls had targeted him because he had ' been on the wrong side of the law ' in the past			2
the star hit back against that claim , saying : ' i 've never been convicted of anything other than speeding , so maybe you 'd like to retract that			0
' the ex-footballer 's personal life frequently made headlines during his career - he broke up with tv presenter @entity112 after punching her in a bar , and was once caught dogging - but he has never been implicated in a crime			0
he added : ' regardless of what the perception of me as a character is , i have the right to be able to walk down the road , and if someone calls me the n - word to be able to report it and get it to dealt with			0
