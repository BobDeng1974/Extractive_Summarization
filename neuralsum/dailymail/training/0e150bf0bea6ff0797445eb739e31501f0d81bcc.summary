among the grand targets being pursued by @entity1 , from career redemption to a place in the @entity4 and a run in the @entity6 , is a piece of paper worth £ 100			1
written on it are his name and a number that seemed unfeasibly high when he scrawled it last summer			1
once folded , it was handed to @entity15 with the cash			1
like most aspects of life at @entity20 , it was the manager ’s idea			1
‘ he called us together one day before the season started and told us all to do it , ’ @entity1 explains			1
@entity1 hopes to take his scoring form into the @entity6 third round replay against @entity28 the @entity20 star has scored 17 times for his club this season and is the country 's second top goalscorer @entity35 's @entity34 tops the leader board for highest scorers throughout the @entity39 league ‘ strikers had to put down what they were going to score this season , goalkeepers had to write how many clean sheets and so on			1
then we each had to put £ 100 into the gaffer ’s pot — it is going to charity if you do n’t reach your number			1
@entity34 ( @entity35 ) - 18 @entity1 ( @entity20 ) - 17 @entity53 ( @entity54 ) - 17 @entity55 ( @entity56 ) - 15 @entity57 ( @entity58 ) - 15 @entity59 ( @entity60 ) - 14 @entity61 ( @entity62 ) - 13 @entity63 ( @entity64 ) - 13 @entity65 ( @entity66 ) - 13 @entity67 ( @entity68 ) - 13 ‘ if you reach it you get it back			1
you do n’t put down a low number because it ’s for charity and besides , the gaffer would never allow it			2
i put down quite a high number			2
i wo n’t tell you what it was as i ’m not there yet but it looks like i might get there			2
’ like a number of @entity15 ’s decisions , it seems to have had a positive effect on the 31 - year - old striker who was once drifting but is now the leading scorer in the @entity88 ; a 17 - goal spearhead in a team who sit third in the division			1
tonight @entity20 try to accomplish what @entity93 failed to do and beat third - placed @entity4 side @entity28 , in an @entity6 third - round replay at @entity96			1
it ’s not bad for a club that was bottom of the @entity88 table when @entity15 arrived in november 2012			2
only @entity100 , a £ 10,000 signing from @entity102 , commanded a fee			2
the rest of his recruits , including @entity1 , cost nothing			1
for @entity1 , the @entity88 player of the month for december , the goal rush is something he never saw coming			1
@entity55 makes up a top four of goal scorers in @entity39 that contains no @entity4 players @entity58 star @entity113 ( left ) has had a perfect start to his @entity4 career , scoring 15 goals ‘ i ’m as surprised as anyone about how this season has gone , ’ he says			1
‘ this is the best time of my career			2
’ the @entity121 international spent the first few years bouncing from @entity123 with @entity124 to the @entity125 , before @entity15 took him to @entity127 in 2005			2
it was good but not much more for a striker mostly playing on the left wing — if at all			2
he never scored more than three goals in a season and the games dried up			2
in 2010 , @entity136 ’s @entity135 came along			2
‘ they were the team i supported as a boy , so i took a pay cut to go but it did n’t go well			0
when i was given a run in the team i scored two in three starts , but then i got injured			0
@entity59 has netted 14 times for @entity60 despite spending a month out with a knee injury ‘ there was a game i was sitting out when we won 9 - 0 — the strikers , @entity151 and @entity152 , scored a hat - trick each			0
i ’m in the stands thinking , “ how is your luck ? ” i did n’t play that next weekend , obviously , and the lads kept scoring			1
i could n’t get back in and i accepted that			0
’ he spent two loan spells at @entity20 between 2010 and 2012 and it was during a third spell at the club in 2012 - 13 that @entity15 took over			1
the following summer the move became permanent			0
‘ maybe i was destined to play for @entity20 , ’ @entity1 says			1
‘ i came here under @entity162			0
i got on brilliantly with him and do still			0
he gave me a copy of his book — a good read			0
i did n’t get a mention ! ‘ the gaffer now has done so much for me			0
on his first day here he called me into his office and said i would be a striker again , no more playing on the left			0
it was music to my ears			0
his faith in me has been so important			0
’ @entity66 striker @entity65 has been in spectacular form for @entity176 's men this season the result was 13 goals last season and a stunning run in this campaign			1
the signs are good , even if the challenge of maintaining their form will be increased by interest in @entity187			1
@entity189 boss @entity188 has admitted he is keen on the defender but @entity1 said : ‘ i do n’t see why he should go when he is playing here every week			1
if you go to a big club you are probably going to be on the bench			0
in that position , i would rather play every week			0
’ the words carry weight from a man who has served his time on the sidelines			0
if @entity100 sticks around then @entity1 will have a better chance of getting back to the @entity4			1
either way , you would not bet against him getting back his £ 100			0
@entity203 is the title sponsor of @entity205			0
this season , a £ 250,000 @entity206 will go to a @entity205 club to spend on players in the @entity211 transfer window			0
fans who bet with @entity203 generate @entity213 and go into a random draw to win a £ 5,000 prize - and the £ 250,000 @entity206 for their @entity205 club			0

@entity1 hopes to continue his scoring form against @entity28
the @entity20 star is the second top goal scorer in the country behind @entity35 's @entity34
the @entity20 face the @entity28 in an @entity6 third round replay
