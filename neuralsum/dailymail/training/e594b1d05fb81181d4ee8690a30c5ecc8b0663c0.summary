an 8 - year - old girl has recalled the painful and terrifying moment a dolphin lunged out of the water at a @entity5 park and latched onto her hand , half pulling her back into the tank with it			1
@entity11 of @entity12 , @entity10 said she was feeding the dolphins in @entity14 , @entity15 and raised the paper carton she was holding ' when the dolphin saw that , it leaped at me and bit me , ate the carton			1
' ' it really , really hurt , ' @entity11 said in an interview on monday with @entity23 's ' @entity22 ' where she showed her nearly healed injuries			1
her father @entity40 , who was with her at the theme park when the dolphin lunged from its pool on november 21 , described his reaction as : ' instant fear			1
' ' i thought that , wow , i may have to lunge at the dolphin , and pull her or , get physically involved , ' he recounted of all the thoughts swirling in his head			2
after pulling his daughter away from the pool , it was then a @entity29 employee asked if they needed help			0
' they asked if she wanted first aid , and i said " she 's bleeding " so yes , we want first aid , ' he recalled			0
@entity11 held two dolphin stuffed animals as she recounted the ordeal , saying she hoped the dolphin did n't get sick from eating the paper carton			1
she 's prayed for the animal at night			2
close contact : @entity11 's younger brother leans in close to feed one of the marine mammals unaware : @entity11 turned away from the dolphin she was feeding fish scrap to but continuing to hold the now empty cardboard container within the dolphin 's view painful moment : @entity11 cringes as the dolphin bites down harder strong pull : the dolphin nearly drags @entity11 into the water with it to her parents ' horror while dolphins are known for their playful behaviour and permanently painted smiles , they are also known for their sheer physical power and sharp teeth which have led to attacks on humans			1
human feeding is linked behind many reported attacks though other incidents have been seen during moments of sexual aggression			2
federal officials say dolphins are of little threat to people in captive swim programs - with in 1994 less than 1 out of 10,000 people injured - but those animals in the wild are far more spontaneous and unpredictable in their behaviour			2
earlier this year in @entity110 a single wild dolphin was reported terrorizing residents in a waterside community in @entity113 where it bit three people in june			2
in one incident a boater 's hand was sliced open by the dolphin 's teeth while he stuck his hand in the water to clean it			1
in another case a girl was dragged into the water by her ankle			0
other reports described the dolphin as head butting and chasing acquaintances			0
like many other incidents , officials in @entity110 said there were related reports of people feeding the dolphin and attempting to lure it out with food potentially leading to its association of all humans having food			1
' twice , ' her mother said			0
the paper cartons are used to hold fish children and others feed the dolphins			1
@entity11 's parents say park - goers may not realize the risk involved in feeding dolphins , which is why they posted video of the bite to @entity154 , so parents can decide for themselves whether it is safe			1
mr @entity40 ' daughter ’s cuts are healing , he said , but he and his wife are upset with the way @entity5 employees handled the incident , saying they trivialized the severity of it			1
@entity5 officials said in a statement that the safety of their guests is paramount , and they are taking the situation seriously			1
' educators and animal care staff are always on - site at this area , monitoring all interactions and are committed to guest safety , ' @entity5 said in the statement			2
' educators and animal care staff were at the attraction when this happened and immediately connected with the family , ' @entity5 said			2
' in addition , a member of our health services team was in the area at @entity184 and quickly responded and treated the young girl			0
' ‘ thank @entity189 it did n’t pull her in the water			0
it ’s only a matter of time before someone gets seriously injured at this attraction , ’ @entity40 wrote in a message at the end of his video			0
this is n’t the first dolphin bite the park has seen			0
in 2006 , two adults pried open a dolphin 's mouth to free a 7 - year - old boy from its grip , which left a bruise on the boy ’s hand , according to another @entity208 article			0
setting an example : appearing on @entity22 on monday , the girl 's parents said they posted the video to show the dangers of hand feeding dolphins but do n't plan to take legal action not the first time : @entity5 has had trouble with its dolphins biting young visitors in the past @entity5 spokesperson @entity220 at the time told the @entity208 that no changes were being planned for the attraction			1
@entity225 ’s mother , @entity224 , said she would have been more careful if she had known her daughter might get bitten			0
‘ i felt safe , ’ she said			0
‘ everyone just imagines dolphins as smiling , non-biting animals with knobby teeth			0
you forget these are wild animals			0
’ the @entity40 family said they do not plan to take legal action against the @entity14 - based theme park , but said they would like @entity29 to increase the age limit for children feeding dolphins and remind parents that dolphins are n’t always as friendly as they look			1
@entity5 did not return requests for comment from @entity245			2
