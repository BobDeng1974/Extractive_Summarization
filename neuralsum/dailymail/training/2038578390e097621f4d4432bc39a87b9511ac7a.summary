crackdown : education secretary @entity0 said he is looking at hate speech laws in an attempt to stamp out the use of the word ' gay ' as an insult education secretary @entity0 yesterday declared war on the ‘ utterly outrageous and medieval ’ use of the word ‘ gay ’ as an insult			1
he will study current laws to ensure they are ‘ properly policed ’ and could even ‘ sharpen ’ them in a bid to stamp out offensive homophobic language			1
mr @entity0 told a conference held by pressure group @entity15 that the @entity16 was determined to protect gay pupils from being subjected to homophobic bullying at school			1
he said that it was unacceptable to use the word ‘ gay ’ as abuse and named and shamed former @entity24 dj @entity23			1
mr @entity23 was branded @entity15 ’s ‘ @entity29 ’ at their annual awards ceremony in 2006 after he dismissed a ringtone , saying : ‘ i do n’t want that one , it ’s gay			0
’ hate speech laws in the @entity31 are found in several statutes			1
expressions of hatred towards someone on account of that person ’s colour , race , nationality , religion or sexual orientation is forbidden			0
famously , @entity43 , a 21 - year - old student , was taken to court in 2006 for calling a policeman ’s horse ‘ gay ’ after being arrested under section five of the @entity48			0
his remarks were deemed likely to cause harassment , alarm or distress by police , but the prosecution dropped the case at @entity58 magistrates ’ court			0
pop singer @entity59 yesterday highlighted the ‘ subconscious ’ use of the word ‘ gay ’ and how it was used as a ‘ negative term ’ when he was growing up			2
he challenged mr @entity0 at the @entity64 conference about how few people are brought to account in law for using offensive homophobic language			1
mr @entity0 replied : ‘ there are laws there to prevent it happening			2
‘ one thing i will do is talk to @entity74 ( @entity74 , chief executive of @entity15 ) and others about how we can make sure that the laws we ’ve got at the moment are properly policed and also i ’m always open if we need to sharpen the law because it ’s not working , i ’m always open to that argument			1
’ in an exchange with the former winner of @entity84 , the @entity0 agreed that it was wrong for people to argue that homophobic bullying was ‘ less than an issue than bullying based on skin colour or other cultures ’			1
he added : ‘ there ’s more to be done			0
i want to work with @entity15 to do it			0
war of the words : while former @entity24 dj @entity23 ( left ) was singled out for using the word as a dismissive term , singer @entity59 ( right ) urged @entity0 to tackle homophobic bullying ‘ but i think one of the things i can do effectively is wherever there ’s an opportunity on a public platform to say so , to say that it ’s just utterly outrageous and medieval to think that to use the word gay as an insult is somehow acceptable			1
‘ whether it ’s @entity23 or anyone else does it , it ’s wrong and they should be called out			0
’ mr @entity0 said that the @entity16 agreement had referred to the vital importance of tackling bullying , especially homophobic bullying , in schools			1
he said this was a recognition that even as ‘ prejudice in our society was in many ways receding there were some prejudices that remain remarkably and irrationally stubborn ’			0
one of these was the prejudice sometimes shown to lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender people , and to the young in particular			0
he said : ‘ that prejudice would sometimes find its expression in thoughtless words from disc jockeys or in language in playgrounds that was n’t effectively policed			2
’ he added : ‘ therefore it was important even as we saw prejudice recede elsewhere to be more vigilant and more determined than ever to deal with this particular prejudice and the effect it had on young people			0
offensive : the @entity0 said that it was wrong for people to argue that homophobic bullying was ' less than an issue than bullying based on skin colour or other cultures ' ‘ because if you ’re growing up , wrestling with your sexuality , knowing that it will mean your life will perhaps form a different path from the one your parents envisaged , the last thing that you need to feel is that at school , where other people who should be there to care for you and show you what adult life can bring , the last thing you need is any sense that the difficulties with which you ’re wrestling and the path on which you wish to embark are in any way either a legitimate subject for humour , ostracism or prejudice			2
‘ what young people need as they decide for themselves how they ’re going to live their lives is support , approval and celebration			0
’ @entity173 , general secretary of @entity174 , said last night : ‘ we are pleased the @entity175 has recognised the impact homophobic bullying can have on young people			2
‘ by combating bullying and making it clear education should be inclusive school leaders can help reinforce the message that there is no place for homophobia in a school or anywhere in society			2

@entity0 said the homophobic language is ' medieval '
former @entity24 dj @entity192 singled out for using the word in a dismissive way
