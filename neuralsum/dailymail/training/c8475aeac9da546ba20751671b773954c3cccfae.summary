ten years ago today one of the most remarkable moments in human history took place , when the @entity5 probe landed on @entity8 ’s largest moon - @entity6 it remains the only landing of a spacecraft in the outer solar system to date - and to celebrate the accomplishment @entity14 has released a stunning video visualising the approach			1
it shows what the probe would have seen as it approached the moon and passed through the atmosphere , before finally coming to rest in a dried - up methane riverbed			2
it revealed highlands and darker areas , and also channels thought to have been carved by lakes and rivers of liquid methane at some point in the past the @entity36 , which launched on 15 october 1997 from @entity37 , @entity38 , is a joint project between @entity14 , @entity39 and the @entity42 space agency - @entity40			1
the @entity5 probe itself was built and operated by @entity39			1
launch : 15 october 1997 from @entity45 , @entity38 dimensions : 22 feet ( 6.7 metres ) high ; 13.1 feet ( 4 meters ) wide total weight : 5,712 kilograms ( 12,593 pounds ) with fuel , @entity5 probe , adapter , etc orbiter weight ( unfueled ) : 2,125 kilograms ( 4,685 pounds ) power : 885 watts ( 633 watts at end of mission ) from radioisotope thermoelectric generators @entity56 traveled to reach @entity8 : 2.2 billion miles ( 3.5 billion kilometres ) key instruments : imaging radar , cosmic dust analyser , infrared mapping spectrometer the video , made using real images from @entity36 and @entity5 , begins at a great distance from @entity6 and @entity8 , a ‘ billion times further ’ than the final view at the surface according to the narrator			1
as the camera zooms in , the definition of the shadows on @entity8 can be noticed , cast by its rings , and @entity6 ’s brown hazy atmosphere can also be seen			2
. the camera then begins to move down onto the moon , showing light regions - highlands - and dark regions , which are mostly dune fields			0
the probe also measured colour on the surface using spectrometres , which is exaggerated as the camera approaches the surface			0
most of @entity6 ’s surface is brown , and its atmosphere is so thick that it is darker on the surface during the day that it is on @entity89 during an extremely cloudy day			0
during its descent @entity5 also revealed a complicated system of channels where rivers of methane were thought to have once flowed			2
other regions on the moon still have rivers and lakes of this thick substance			0
this animation shows a sped - up view of the approach and landing of the @entity5 probe on the surface of @entity6 ten years ago on 15 january 2005			1

the @entity5 probe itself , shown here in an artist 's illustration , was built and operated by @entity39 it is now ten years since @entity39 's @entity5 probe landed on @entity6			1
to celebrate the achievement @entity14 released a video visualisation using real images taken by the probe			1
this graphic reveals some of the stats about @entity6			0
while the @entity5 prove is now dead , @entity36 continues to flyby the moon every month or so perhaps the most amazing image of @entity6 by @entity5 is this one from the surface , showing pebbles that have been rounded by liquids the descent on 15 january 2005 lasted a total of two hours , with @entity5 landing on a frigid floodplain surrounded by icy cobblestones			1
it is the only landing that has ever been performed in the outer solar system to date , and one of only a handful of bodies - the others being @entity136 , @entity137 , the moon , two asteroids and most recently a comet - that manmade probes have ever landed on			1
on the surface the probe continued to send back data for more than an hour , until its batteries were drained			0
since that historic moment , scientists have pored over volumes of data about @entity6 sent back to @entity89			0
perhaps most surprisingly , the results over the years have shown @entity6 to be a somewhat @entity89 - like world - at least , the most @entity89 - like in the solar system aside from our own			1
‘ a mission of this ambitious scale represents a triumph in international collaboration , ’ said @entity154 , @entity155 manager at @entity14 's @entity156 in @entity157 , @entity158			2
‘ from the mission 's formal beginning in 1982 , to @entity5 ' spectacular landing 23 years later , to the present day , @entity36 owes much of its success to the tremendous synergy and cooperation between more than a dozen countries			1
' this teamwork is still a major strength of the project as the @entity36 orbiter continues to explore the @entity8 system			1
’ this illustration shows how the @entity5 probe made its descent to the surface			1
after passing through the atmosphere a parachute was used to slow its descent			0
the descent on 15 january 2005 lasted a total of two hours , with @entity5 landing on a frigid floodplain surrounded by icy cobblestones this picture of @entity6 , taken by @entity5 on its way to the surface , showed what appeared to be channels that were once carved by lakes and rivers			1
it is now thought that @entity6 has highly viscous bodies of water on its surface composed of liquid methane , as evidenced by further radar imaging of the surface with its thick atmosphere and organic - rich chemistry , @entity6 resembles a frozen version of @entity89 several billion years ago , before life began pumping oxygen into our atmosphere			2
because @entity6 is smaller than @entity89 , its gravity does n’t hold onto its gaseous envelope as tightly , so the atmosphere extends 370 miles ( 595 kilometres ) into space			0
as on @entity89 , the climate is driven mostly by changes in the amount of sunlight that comes with the seasons , although the seasons on @entity6 are about seven @entity89 years long			2
@entity6 's ‘ water ’ is liquid methane , @entity216 , better known on @entity89 as natural gas			0
regular @entity89 - water , @entity220 , would be frozen solid on @entity6 where the surface temperature is @entity222 ( -292 ° f )			0
with @entity6 's low gravity and dense atmosphere , methane raindrops could grow twice as large as @entity89 's raindrops			0
as well as this , they would fall more slowly , drifting down like snowflakes			0
but scientists think it rains perhaps only every few decades			0
@entity231 , editor of @entity232 , added : ‘ the successful landing of @entity5 on @entity8 's @entity6 has to be one of my personal highlights in the history of human space exploration			1
‘ the lander might have only sent back an hour and a half or so of data before the @entity36 orbiter lost contact with it , but in that time the world got a glimpse of exactly what was beneath the previously impenetrable cloud layer of @entity8 's biggest moon : lakes of liquid methane , ice volcanoes and an otherwise surprisingly terrestrial moon			2
‘ it returned the only image we 've taken from the surface of an object in the @entity257 , it 's the only lander that 's successfully touched - down on a moon or planet this far away , plus it was made by @entity39 too			0
‘ it 's just nice to have such a successful and high - profile mission that we can call our own , in a scientific field that 's dominated by @entity14			0
' while @entity5 might have long since passed away , the hugely successful @entity36 mission is continuing around the @entity267 system			2
it will continue observing the gas giant and its moons until 2017 , when it will be sent burning up in the atmosphere of @entity8 as it runs out of fuel to prevent it crashing on and contaminating any of its moons .			0

it is now ten years since @entity39 's @entity5 probe landed on @entity6
to celebrate the achievement @entity14 has released a video visualisation
it shows the view as the probe would have approached and landed
the touch down in 2005 was the first ever landing in the outer solar system
the @entity36 spacecraft continues to orbit @entity8 and its moons today
