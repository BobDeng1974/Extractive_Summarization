by @entity0 last updated at 12:40 pm on 25th october 2011 large numbers of @entity3 shareholders have registered their anger over the phone - hacking scandal by opposing the re-election of @entity7 and @entity8 to the board of directors			1

@entity33 , a @entity34 mp who attended the meeting in @entity36 , said yesterday : ' this is the autumn of the patriarch			0

' the votes against his two sons represent more than half of the cast ballots outside the control of either the @entity8 family trust - which has about 38 per cent of the outstanding shares - or the family 's key backer , @entity54 prince @entity52 , who has 7 per cent			0

it is understood that the committee is unsatisfied with some of mr @entity14 's answers and he has been recalled to explain himself further			0
the announcement came after mr @entity14 's predecessor @entity88 was grilled by video - link mr @entity88 , the most senior casualty of the hacking scandal so far , told @entity92 there was ' no reason ' why mr @entity14 should resign from his post at @entity76 ( @entity96 )			1
a close lieutenant of @entity14 who had worked with the @entity3 chief for more than 50 years , mr @entity88 quit as ceo of the company 's @entity101 subsidiary in july as the scale of hacking which took place under his watch at @entity96 - owned @entity107 became apparent			2
mr @entity88 acknowledged that some of the evidence previously given to the committee by @entity96 executives , when they insisted that hacking at the sunday tabloid was limited to a single rogue reporter , had turned out to be ' not accurate '			1
but he challenged @entity92 ' suggestions that this meant executives had been ' untruthful ' , insisting that events had become clear only over the past couple of years and the full picture of what happened was still not known			1
