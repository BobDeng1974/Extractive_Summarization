@entity0 believes @entity2 's fans and owners will only be satisfied with a more attacking style of football if it is accompanied by an improvement at the back			1
the clash between @entity0 's perceived managerial pragmatism and the desire among @entity2 supporters for free - flowing forward play has been a constant feature of his time at the club			1
this season has been earmarked as a chance for @entity0 to prove he can meet expectations and his side were a much improved attacking force in monday 's 2 - 2 draw at @entity22			1
@entity23 marks his @entity2 debut with a stunning goal from outside the area against @entity22 @entity23 is congratulated by his @entity2 team - mates after scoring his first goal for the club @entity2 's @entity30 ( on the floor ) sees his effort deflect in off @entity33 @entity2 new boy @entity30 celebrates with @entity34 after making it 2 - 2 @entity23 conjured a stunning 25 - yard strike on his first league start and , at 2 - 1 down , strike partner @entity30 saw his shot turned over the line by home defender @entity33			1
the pair gave a good impression of a deadly partnership in the making , but @entity0 reiterated his longheld belief that the defensive foundations remain just as important as what happens at the other end of the pitch			1
' i think the owners here want us to win more than anything , like i want us to win , ' he said			0
' they 're happy , we 're all happy , with the way the squad is evolving and when you have more talented squad you play more attractive football			0
' though i say it with caution , attractive football is alright but you 've got to start putting defensive units and defensive work together to get the results you need			0
' attractive football with no wins is no good to me and not to the owners and certainly wo n't be accepted by the supporters			0
@entity0 says @entity2 's fans would not accept attractive football if the club were not picking up points @entity71 ( centre ) heads in @entity22 's first goal in the 2 - 2 draw with @entity2 ' we were very good defensively last year as a team			1
we had lots of clean sheets in last year 's campaign , 14 in fact , and we 've not had one yet			0
for me as a manager , that 's a disappointment			2
that 's something we 're going to have to think about			0
' @entity2 twice came from behind to take a point at the @entity87 , with debutants @entity71 and @entity89 on target for the hosts			2
the latter is a familiar face , having only left @entity2 on transfer deadline day			2
the @entity95 had questioned his use by @entity0 and appeared particularly keen to make an impression , never more so than when scavenging @entity100 's throw - in in the build - up to his goal			1
yet @entity0 insisted the Â£ 3.5million sale was still the right decision			1
' we wish @entity106 all the best , it was a good move for him and good for us , ' he said			0
' @entity106 was running out of contract and would have been a free agent at end of the season , or may have signed a pre-contract abroad in january			0
@entity113 ( left ) scores on his debut for @entity22 against his old club @entity2 @entity117 is congratulated by his @entity22 team - mates after making it 2 - 1 to the home side ' we got good money for him and got in a good player , @entity122 , with @entity123 and @entity125 experience			1
' @entity22 boss @entity126 , meanwhile , is just as happy to have the bustling midfielder on board			2
' @entity113 is a no - brainer			0
he 's played in the @entity123 for the last six years and what i saw him do on debut i 've seen him do many times for @entity135 and @entity2			1
' he 's big , powerful , handles the ball well with both feet , he 's got a little trick and as we saw today he 's got a goal in him			0
' @entity126 is delighted to have been able to sign @entity117 from @entity2 the arrival of @entity71 and @entity113 , not to mention @entity143 and @entity144 , who both made their first appearances off the bench , has increased competition in @entity126 's squad significantly			1
the likes of @entity151 , @entity152 and @entity153 all missed out on the matchday squad and the selection dilemma is unlikely to go away			0
' we 'd all love to ( have ) 17 ( man squads ) because it 's easier to manage but we have to carry a 25 - man squad because the transfer window does n't open until january , ' added @entity126			2
' i 've had no injuries this week and i 've had to leave out six or seven players , which shows the strength in depth we 've got now			0

@entity2 manager wants his side to be defensively solid to pick up points
@entity0 *speaking* after monday 's 2 - 2 draw with @entity22
@entity2 were more attacking with new signing @entity23 impressing
@entity177 also defended his decision to let @entity117 leave the club
