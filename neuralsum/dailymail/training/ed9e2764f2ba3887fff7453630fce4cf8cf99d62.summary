by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity3 minister : @entity4 is the mp for @entity5 and @entity6 in @entity7 foreign office minister @entity4 quit yesterday , saying his salary and expenses of almost £ 120,000 were not enough to enable his children to live with him in @entity11			1
the mp for @entity5 and @entity6 in @entity7 resigned with an attack on parliamentary expenses - complaining that his income would not cover the cost of a @entity17 flat that would accommodate his family			1
this is despite the fact that he received a ministerial salary of £ 89,435 , an allowance of around £ 28,000 to rent a property in @entity11 and pays his wife lizibeth up to £ 25,000 in her role as his office manager			1
mr @entity4 said he will also leave @entity27 at next year ’s election because he hardly ever sees his family – two daughters aged 15 and 13 and a son aged 12 – because they live in his constituency			1
‘ there needs to be a system of allowances and support structures in place that supports mps in their work , enables them to be normal people , which currently i believe is not the case , ’ he said			0
‘ that ’s the main reason i have resigned			0
the sacrifice to family life has become intolerable and the support for continuance of family life is not there ... it is time we had a mature debate about this			0
‘ when i became an mp , the situation and support mechanisms were very different			0
you were able to have a family home in the constituency and a family home in @entity11			2
that is no longer the case			0
six months after becoming an mp , mr @entity4 was said to have bought a four - bedroom terraced house ( below , centre ) in @entity78 , south - west @entity11 , for £ 650,000			1
its mortgage interest was paid by taxpayers from 2001 and 2009 , with the mp claiming more than £ 2,000 a month to cover the cost , reported the @entity83			1
following the expenses scandal in 2009 , a rule change meant mr @entity4 could only now claim for renting in @entity11 - instead of claiming for the mortgage interest on his @entity78 home			2
property records show he sold the house soon after for £ 1,187,500 in december 2010 , which represented a rise of more than £ 500,000 on what he had paid almost a decade ago			1
an estate agents ' description from 2010 which can still be viewed on property website @entity95 described the house as a ‘ spacious and well - presented terraced family home ’			2
the value of the house is now £ 1,742,500 - a further increase of more than £ 500,000			1
asked if his expenses claims were in order under the old system , mr @entity4 said : ‘ i was one of those who was not involved at all			2
’ he claimed there were other mps in a similar position to him who were ‘ reluctant ’ to talk because they feared being attacked as ‘ greedy ’			0
he told @entity108 ’s @entity110 programme : ‘ the previous expenses system was clearly indefensible , abused and people rightly went to prison for fraudulent behaviour			1
’ he said the reason for his departure was ‘ a lifestyle choice ’ , adding : ‘ it became intolerable – i rarely see my children			0
’ criticising the parliamentary expenses regime , he said : ‘ the allowances do not stretch to renting a flat near @entity17 large enough for my children , so i stay in a hotel			1
’ mr @entity4 yesterday received the support of @entity126 backbencher @entity125 , who said on @entity127 that ‘ only the wealthy ’ can afford to have their family in @entity17			2
but @entity131 , of the @entity132 ’ @entity130 , said it was ‘ ridiculous ’ to say that almost £ 30,000 was not enough to find a decent family home in @entity11			2
‘ the expenses system is more than generous , and hearing an mp complaining about it will do nothing to restore voters ’ trust in their @entity17 representatives , ’ he said			1
‘ it ’s no wonder so many people feel some politicians are out of touch			0
’ mr @entity4 said he told mr @entity145 he wanted to go at the time of the reshuffle last month , but waited to announce it so he could tell his local association first			0
quit : the mp resigned with an attack on parliamentary expenses - complaining that his income would not cover the cost of a @entity17 flat that would accommodate his family he denied there was any link with @entity159 ’s decision to quit as a @entity3 minister last week in a disagreement over @entity163 policy , but his resignation has increased the sense of disarray at the heart of government as the @entity170 crisis deepens			1
' the sacrifice to family life has become intolerable and the support for continuance of family life is not there ' @entity4 the @entity177 , which oversees mps ’ expenses , said it was ‘ awake to the impact on family life ’ for mps who have to live in two locations			0
‘ that is exactly why we provide more support to mps with family or caring responsibilities , ’ it said			0
@entity191 named @entity126 mp @entity192 as the new minister for @entity194 .			0
