by @entity0 @entity2 health officials are testing a patient suspected of contracting the deadly ebola virus as fears grow the disease is starting to spread beyond @entity7			1
the @entity9 epidemic has so far been contained to west @entity11 nations , where almost 900 people have died from more than 1600 confirmed cases			1
but @entity2 is now testing samples from a man who recently returned from a business trip to @entity18 for suspected @entity9 infection , the @entity14 said			1
it said the man , a @entity2 in his 40s , was at a hospital in the @entity25 city of @entity26			2
the ministry also recently announced it will not issue visas for nationals from ebola - struck countries for the annual @entity64 pilgrimage in october			0
the pilgrimage involves millions of @entity65 making the journey to the holy cities of @entity68 and @entity69 in @entity2			2
however , officials will not be issuing @entity64 visas to anyone from @entity18 , @entity73 and @entity32 due to the @entity9 outbreak and the potential for its spread during a festival in which millions travel together in close proximity			1
the country is already battling an outbreak of @entity81 ( @entity81 ) , which has infected hundreds in the past few months			0
meanwhile , the @entity82 has pledged up to $ 200 million in emergency funding to help @entity7 tackle the spread of @entity9 , as hopes grow an experimental new ' miracle ' cure can stem the death toll			1
@entity89 , president of the @entity82 , said the injection of funds would pay for urgently needed medical supplies , salaries for staff and other vital materials in the struggling health systems of @entity73 , @entity32 and @entity18			1
@entity18 health workers speak to people on the streets of @entity40 to educate them about the deadly virus health workers , travelling by motorbike , with others inside a truck , as they attempt to educate people about the spread of the disease @entity108 , head of care personnel , wears a headset under his ventilated plastic suit so that he can communicate with his co-workers at the university hospital during a simulation exercise for a possible infection with a dangerous virus such as @entity9 in @entity117 , @entity118 however , the emergence of an experimental new drug given to the two @entity122 @entity9 patients has raised the possibility a medical breakthrough has been made for a disease which has no previously known cure or vaccine			1
news of the treatment - which has never before been used on humans - comes as the death toll reaches 887 , with more than 1,600 confirmed cases in what is the worst outbreak in the four decade history of @entity9			1
the treatment , called @entity136 , is made by @entity137 of @entity138			1
the serum is created by infecting an animal with the disease then harvesting the antibodies the animals ' bodies create to fight it off			1
it was reported the two @entity122 aid workers , @entity148 , 59 , and dr @entity149 , 33 , used serum taken from infected mice			0
a source told @entity155 dr @entity149 's condition took a serious turn for the worse and he was quickly issued with a dose of the medication			0
he made a ' miraculous ' improvement within the space of an hour and was able to board his plane to the @entity122 the next morning			0
@entity136 is the experimental new drug which was administered to the two @entity122 citizens who contracted @entity9			1
produced by @entity137 of @entity138 , the serum is created by infecting an animal with the disease then harvesting the animal 's immune system antibodies which its body creates to fight it			2
it is a type of drug known as a ' monoclonal antibody ' , and before this use , it had only been tested on monkeys			0
unfortunately , there is very little of the radical new drug available and it has not yet undergone the usual safety tests of other drugs			0
times of @entity138 reported a company spokesperson as saying : ' @entity136 was first identified as a drug candidate in january 2014 and has not yet been evaluated for safety in humans			2
as such , very little of the drug is currently available			0
' @entity186 and its partners are co-operating with appropriate government agencies to increase production as quickly as possible			0
' remarkably , @entity136 is grown in specially modified leaves of tobacco			2
@entity137 has contracted a @entity194 tobacco plant to help produce the serum			0
the plants must be ' infected ' with a type of protein , which over time , the plant goes on to reproduce itself			0
after a week or so , it has made enough of the protein to turn into a useable drug which can be extracted			0
mrs @entity148 was also given the treatment , but required a second dose before she showed signs of improvement			0
the $ 200m in @entity82 funding has been earmarked to help contain @entity9 and prevent the spreading to neighbouring countries			1
however , there are fears it is already too late			0
a doctor has now become the second confirmed case of @entity9 in @entity214 after helping to treat a @entity122 businessman who died from the disease			1
authorities have been monitoring anyone who came into close contact with @entity220 , a @entity32 and @entity122 citizen who died of @entity9 in @entity221 last month shortly after arriving at the airport			1
the second confirmed case was a doctor who looked after him			0
there are now a suspected eight cases of @entity9 in @entity214 , all of whom came into contact with mr @entity220			1
health commissioner @entity231 also said a further six people who had made contact with @entity220 had been quarantined but were not showing symptoms			2
back to the @entity234 : ebola patient @entity148 , a missionary from @entity235 , has left @entity32 on a plane bound for @entity237 , @entity238 recovering : dr @entity149 , seen here with his wife @entity241 , is improving at @entity242 , after receiving a dose of an experimental serum the spread of @entity9 in @entity7 's most populous country is an alarming setback as officials across the region battle to stop the spread of the disease			1
the emergence of a second case also raises serious concerns about the infection control practices in @entity214 , and also raise the spectre that more cases could emerge			2
it can take up to 21 days after exposure to the virus for symptoms to appear			0
they include fever , sore throat , muscle pains and headaches			0
often nausea , vomiting and diarrhea follow , along with severe internal and external bleeding in advanced stages of the disease			0
doctors in @entity214 had been monitoring people who cam into contact with @entity220 , a @entity32 - @entity122 citizen who died last month			1
there are now eight suspected cases doctors and other health workers on the front lines of the @entity9 crisis have been among the most vulnerable to infection as they are in direct physical contact with patients			1
ms @entity148 , who was volunteering as a hygenist in @entity9 decontamination units , has now landed in the @entity122 , where she is expected to head to @entity238 's @entity242 where dr @entity149 has already been taken			2
the two both contracted @entity9 after working on the same medical mission team treating victims of the virus around @entity31 , @entity32			1
meanwhile , a third @entity122 has been taken into isolation at @entity293 's @entity292 showing symptoms of @entity9			2
the patient arrived at the hospital ’s emergency room early on monday morning with ‘ a high fever and gastrointestinal symptoms , ’ according to a statement			0
however the @entity301 has since released a statement stating that the patient is unlikely to have the deadly disease			2
a leading @entity305 scientist has also claimed we may have seen the peak of the epidemic			0
@entity309 , a professor at the @entity310 , said @entity73 had already seen the worst of the outbreak , according to @entity313			2
' this is the largest outbreak of @entity9 that so far has been recorded			0
the numbers are increasing in @entity18 but they appear to have peaked in @entity73 where the epidemic first started , ' he said .			1

@entity2 health ministry confirms it is testing businessman for disease
@entity82 pledges up to $ 200 million to help stop @entity9 epidemic
however , new medicine @entity136 ' miraculously ' improved condition of patient
@entity136 is made from the antibodies of animals infected with the disease
