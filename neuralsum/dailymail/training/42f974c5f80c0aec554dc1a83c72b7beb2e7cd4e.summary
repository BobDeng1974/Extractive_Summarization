@entity0 are stepping up interest in @entity3 right - back @entity2			1
manager @entity4 has admired the 19 - year - old for some time and has had favourable scouting reports throughout the season			0
although he has bought @entity8 from @entity9 , he is allowing @entity10 to leave and that will vacate room for @entity13			0
manager @entity25 believes he can find better players than some of the ones he has sold but will be sorry to lose @entity13 who he has had good reports on			1
@entity25 wants a goalkeeper also			2
he is reluctant to pay the £ 12 - 15m @entity31 have quoted for @entity32 while @entity33 want at least £ 8m for @entity34			0
that has pushed @entity36 and @entity38 keeper @entity37 into the frame who is also on @entity0 's list if they fail to sign @entity42 from @entity43			1
wheels in motion : @entity0 want @entity45 goalkeeper @entity42 with @entity3 potential after @entity37 @entity0 are holding out hope they can persuade @entity48 to join them from @entity49 despite @entity51 's interest			1
@entity49 also maintain that @entity52 have asked to be kept informed			0
