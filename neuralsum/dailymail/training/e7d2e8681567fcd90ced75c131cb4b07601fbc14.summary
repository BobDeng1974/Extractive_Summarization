@entity0 says his team will improve in 2015 after claiming that it is ' nearly impossible ' that they will have as many injury problems in the next 12 months			1
the @entity4 have been struck with crisis after crisis this season , as key players in all positions have suffered injuries , something that @entity0 puts down to so many of his stars taking part in the @entity14			1
but the @entity16 boss is adamant that , with a full squad , his side will be better in the coming year			1
@entity0 claims his team will be better in 2015 if they avoid as many injuries as in the previous year @entity21 is one of 13 @entity16 first - team stars who have had serious injury worries this season @entity24 has been out since october , but should return in the new year as @entity16 's crisis begins to lift thirteen members of the @entity16 first team squad have had significant injuries this season : @entity30 ( hip ) , @entity32 ( thigh ) , @entity34 ( ankle ) , @entity36 ( thigh ) , @entity38 ( @entity39 )			1
@entity40 ( calf ) , @entity21 ( ankle ) , @entity24 ( knee ) , @entity44 ( knee / groin ) , @entity46 ( hamstring ) , @entity48 ( various ) , @entity49 ( foot ) , @entity51 ( calf ) ' i feel it is nearly impossible that we will have the same bad luck on the injury front that we had in 2014 , ' said @entity0 ' what is explainable in 2014 is that it was after the @entity14 and we had many players injured because they played in the @entity14			1
' three members of the @entity16 squad won the @entity14 with @entity63 , but of that trio only @entity64 has been able to hold down a first - team place			1
@entity24 suffered a dip in form before picking up a serious injury in october , while @entity70 has failed to break into the first team this season			0
@entity24 was one of several @entity16 players who were involved deep into last summer 's @entity14 per @entity64 ( centre ) has looked off the pace this season after winning the @entity14 in @entity76 @entity70 ( bottom left ) and @entity24 ( top right ) have both also struggled since winning the @entity14 ' i feel we were very , very unlucky with the injuries we got , ' continued @entity0			1
' with the number of injuries we ’ve had , we survived quite well			0
' but i believe , hopefully in the second part of the season , we ’ll have more stability , especially defensively , to be more consistent			0
' @entity16 's injury problems are beginning to ease , with @entity44 and @entity89 fit again , while @entity38 returned against @entity90 on sunday			2
@entity44 could feature against @entity91 on @entity92 having been on the bench following his recovery from a groin problem , although striker @entity96 , who scored against @entity90 , will need to be assessed before the game			0
@entity96 will need a late fitness test after being withdrawn late on against @entity90 on sunday @entity44 , who was on the bench at @entity100 , could make a first team return after injury midfielder @entity46 is not just match fit as he continues to recover from a hamstring injury , but @entity104 playmaker @entity89 should return having been rested			0
' @entity46 is not available yet , there is no setback , but it is a bit slower than i expected it to be , ' added @entity0			2
' because he had a setback last year , we have to be very cautious with his thigh - he was out for three months , so we have to be a bit more cautious than we would like to be			0
' @entity0 accepts it is a difficult balance to keep all of his players fresh over the hectic @entity117 schedule and also not lose the dynamic of the team			2
@entity89 scored on his first start of the season on @entity122 , and should be fit for @entity92 @entity38 returned against @entity90 but @entity46 is still short of match fitness ' rotation is a sensitive subject because you can destabilise your team with too much rotation , so you have to find the right numbers of rotating the team , ' said @entity0			1
' overall , you want to keep the balance of your team and as well refresh sometimes in the positions where players are a bit tired			0
' @entity16 could move back into the top four above @entity91 with victory on friday , and could close up on @entity136 , whom they now trail by only three points			0
@entity0 said : ' you give your best and if there is a weakness in front of you , you want to take advantage of it			2
' i do n't know if there will be any weakness in front of us , but what i know is that we can give our best until the end of the season to have a chance to do it			0

@entity0 says injuries have *harmed* his side 's chances this season
@entity0 *suggests* the @entity14 could be an explanation for problems
but @entity4 boss hopeful that the worst is behind for his club
