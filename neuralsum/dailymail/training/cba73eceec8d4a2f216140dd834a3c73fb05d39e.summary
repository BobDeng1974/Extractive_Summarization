twelve months ago @entity0 was a happy , healthy five - year - old who found it easy to run around and enjoyed playing with her friends			1
today she has more than doubled her weight to 44 kilograms and is putting on an average of a kilogram per week due to hypothalamic obesity , caused by treatment she received for a life - threatening brain tumour			1
the little girl from @entity11 , @entity12 is wheelchair - bound most of the time as she struggles to ' stand in one spot for more than a minute ' , her mum @entity9 told @entity15			0
@entity0 , 6 , has doubled her body weight since she underwent surgery for a brain tumor in january it also means she is constantly hungry , due to the signals being transmitted from her brain to her stomach			1
' she cries a lot , she gets cranky , she gets grumpy and she 'll stare into space , ' ms @entity9 said			2
' she 'll be playing a game and she 'll say " dad i do n't want to think about food " , ' her dad @entity26 added			0
when they took their eldest daughter to hospital in january of this year with concerns about her thyroid , they were devastated when told she had actually developed a brain tumour			2
when the day of the appointment came @entity0 had been suffering from a ' massive headache ' for two days and a scan was done as a precautionary measure			0
@entity0 ( centre ) here with her dad @entity26 ( left ) , mum @entity9 ( top right ) and younger sister @entity41 , 4 , ( bottom right ) is suffering with this extra weight gain the six - year - old ( second from left ) is pictured here at christmas time last year with her family before her surgery she weighed 21 kilos , but now weighs 44 kilos and is continuing to put on weight the six - year - old , here with mum ms @entity9 , is gaining on average a kilo each week ' the ct scan found a tennis ball sized tumor ' , mr @entity26 revealed			1
@entity0 had surgery the same month and her parents said the fallout from the operation could have been ' blindness , seizures and even death '			0
while their daughter was in intensive care recovering from the procedure to remove the tumour , ' @entity9 started to look into what other complications there could be ' , mr @entity26 said			1
' she ( @entity9 ) was in hospital asking the doctors about this increased chance of weight gain ' , he continued , before adding that through their research he and ms @entity9 had discovered there was an 85 per cent chance of @entity0 developing weight problems			1
now , nine months later , @entity0 , 6 , is still gaining weight - almost a kilogram every week - with no sign of it slowing			1
@entity0 , pictured left on sunday and right before her surgery , now spends much of her time in a wheelchair @entity0 suffers from severe knee and ankle pain and struggles to walk for more than a few minutes the youngster had a tumor the size of a tennis ball removed in january , after it was discovered by chance she is constantly hungry as the messages from her brain to her stomach ' it 's ten months later and we have a child that is morbidly obese at six , ' ms @entity9 said			1
' we do have to use the wheelchair to get around , she has severe knee and ankle pain			0
she ca n't stand on the spot for more than a minute			0
' this struggle can also be isolating for @entity0 at school , as she ca n't join her classmates sitting on the floor when they 're reading , and instead must sit on a chair up the back			0
breakfast : a bowl of cereal and a piece of toast with a spread on it morning tea : a handful of nuts lunch : a sandwich and a salad afternoon tea : a piece of fruit or some nuts dinner : vegetable soup with some rice , followed by a yoghurt @entity0 's diet is very tightly controlled by her parents , and she is fed only small portions of very healthy food each day to slow her weight gain down			2
' @entity0 's weight has nothing to do with diet , her body became hardwired ... her body is telling her she is starving ' , ms @entity9 said			1
' @entity0 is very disciplined , there 's other conditions where children have no control and they simply eat what they see or go searching for food , ' her father added			0
' she does n't eat unless we actually allow her to			0
she will sit there and cry but she wo n't actually go searching for food			0
' her stomach is full , but her brain is hungry			0
her brain is saying eat eat eat , ' he continued			0
though the toughest part for ms @entity9 and mr @entity26 has been trying to get @entity0 specialised treatment in @entity154			1
' we have found it difficult to see someone - it 's not considered an emergency so when you ring a specialist they just slot you in to their books ' , mr @entity26 said			1
@entity0 's family are desperately trying to get expert medical help for their daughter her parents have been conducting their own research , and have contacted medical experts overseas			2
@entity0 is pictured here before her surgery the couple have been conducting a lot of research during the 12 weeks they 've been waiting for @entity0 to see someone , and have even reached out to researchers overseas			0
one @entity180 specialist responded to their five page long list of questions to him with an equally detailed answer , and @entity0 's parents believe they need to enlist the help of international medical experts if they want to combat their daughter 's rare condition			1
' some children are very lucky and they do reach a stablisation after a few months , we have n't and see no signs of this happening yet for @entity0 , ' ms @entity9 said			1
' in my mind and my husbands mind this is ultimately a life - threatening condition and we need help			0
' @entity0 , here with sister @entity41 , needs someone who is willing to do some extra work to help their daughter however ms @entity9 and mr @entity26 were adamant that the doctors that had been treating their daughter in @entity154 were at no fault , but their situation was particularly complex			1
' we understand their position , we know that it 's difficult and it might be outside is a lot of people 's expertise , ' mr @entity26 said			2
' what @entity0 needs is someone who is prepared to do some extra work and someone who 's willing to get out of their comfort zone , ' he added			0
@entity0 does n't fit the mold for many people suffering from hypothalamic obesity , and a plan needs to be put in place according to her parents			2
though ms @entity9 said there was one thing she was thankful for out of this ordeal her daughter has gone through			2
' she does n't have yet - thank god - have any understanding that she is obese			0
' ' i hope that by the time she 's old enough , or in the next few months , we will find a solution for her that will help that , ' ms @entity9 added			2
