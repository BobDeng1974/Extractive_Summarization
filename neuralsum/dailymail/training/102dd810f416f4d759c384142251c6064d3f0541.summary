cover - up claims : former mp and @entity3 presidency candidate @entity2 at the party 's conference in @entity6 last week a leading candidate for the @entity3 presidency was yesterday accused of helping cover up @entity10 ’s vile catalogue of child sex abuse			1
@entity2 , who succeeded @entity10 as mp for @entity13 , allegedly ordered her pa to destroy several pages of notes containing a stream of allegations against the paedophile			1
they detailed a litany of abuse at the @entity25 children ’s home in @entity13 , which closed in the mid- 1990s			1
the @entity14 , @entity26 , said she had taken the notes during a 1996 telephone conversation with a former manager of the home , @entity28			1
mr @entity28 had contacted miss @entity2 ’s office in @entity13 as claims of widespread abuse had begun to emerge at the home , where boys as young as ten had been raped			1
he claimed that @entity10 knew of abuse at the school and that it was being covered up by both the home and the local authority			1
but miss @entity26 said her boss did not want to meet mr @entity28 and instructed her to get rid of the notes			2
‘ i was surprised when @entity2 said to me , “ do n’t put the notes in the bin			1
destroy them ” , ’ said miss @entity26			0
‘ i think i took them home and put them on my fire , ’ she said			0
‘ it was the only occasion i can remember when @entity2 or i did not act on a piece of constituency work , which is why it stuck in my memory			2
’ @entity2 , who was mp for @entity13 from 1992 to 1997 , is one of four @entity3 hoping to take over from @entity50 as president of the party			1
last night she denied all knowledge of the claims			0
she told @entity55 she had no recollection of notes detailing child abuse allegations that were written or destroyed by a staff member			1
and she said she did not remember being approached by mr @entity28 , who was a former social worker at @entity25			0
earlier this year , the politician told the @entity61 how she had heard ‘ inklings of rumours ’ about @entity10 ’s involvement in child abuse – but did nothing about it as she thought the stories were spread by political opponents			1
the scale of the abuse was revealed in a book earlier this year by @entity73 , the current mp for @entity13			1
he said : ‘ i am very distressed by this revelation , particularly as i repeatedly tried to contact @entity2 to hear her side of the story for our book on @entity10			1
she never returned my calls and now i know why			0
‘ if @entity2 had acted on the information she was given in 1996 then she could have saved lives as some of the abused boys have subsequently gone on to commit suicide			2
‘ for years victims have been ignored and @entity2 had an opportunity to make a difference and champion their cause			2
the scale of his abuse was revealed in a book earlier this year ‘ but she was too afraid to stand up to @entity10 and that ’s why she ’s not fit to be anywhere near frontline politics , especially not as the next @entity3 president			1
’ the @entity55 reported yesterday that @entity26 , who worked for the former mp between 1995 and 1997 , said she took three or four pages of notes from a long telephone conversation with mr @entity28 in 1996			2
miss @entity26 revealed that when she was first offered a job in miss @entity2 ’s office , she had to be personally interviewed by @entity10			1
‘ it was like the 1950s			0
everything had to go through @entity10 , but he was n’t even a councillor , ’ she said			0
the scale of @entity10 's abuse was revealed in a book by current @entity13 mp @entity73 ( pictured ) miss @entity26 said she left her job after miss @entity2 lost her seat in 1997 and went on to become an mep for the @entity111 until she stood down in 2012			1
she was not entitled to redundancy pay , but miss @entity2 gave her £ 1,000 from her own pocket			0
she said she told the police about the conversations – but does not know if they were acted upon			0
she added : ‘ @entity2 is essentially a good person			0
i am sure that if she had been forced to look into these allegations , she would have been horrified ... but at the end of the day she is a politician and may not have felt comfortable taking on @entity10			2
’ mr @entity28 was responsible for passing a dossier of evidence to the police which eventually saw the school shut down in the 1990s			0
he told the @entity55 that he had arranged visits with @entity2 but they were always cancelled			2
‘ she never got back to me			0
the shame is that many abuse victims could have been helped if @entity2 and many others had taken the abuse at @entity25 seriously at that point , ’ he added			2
last night miss @entity2 said : ‘ i have no recollection whatsoever of anybody contacting me about allegations against @entity10 or child abuse at @entity25 school			1
‘ if anyone had come to me with serious allegations like that i would obviously have acted upon it			0
’ yesterday , at the @entity3 conference in @entity6 , president @entity50 appeared to joke about the party ’s slew of sex scandals			0
he said : ‘ of course there are some parts of the job i am happy to pass on			0
the next time any of you get caught with your pants around your ankles , the media can call someone else to make a comment			0
