by @entity0 the husband of one of the founders of @entity4 has launched his latest bid to run for @entity6 after buying a home in a competitive district in @entity9			1
@entity10 was @entity13 's college roommates when he launched the social network and now @entity10 ' husband @entity15 is using his new - found connections to upstate @entity9 to try to win a spot in @entity6			1
speculation has surrounded @entity15 since he and @entity10 helped lead the charge for marriage equality in @entity9 , but the campaign became official sunday night when a @entity23 ad announced his bid during the @entity25			1
@entity9 issues : @entity15 , seen here with senator @entity35 , worked to help the state pass same sex marriage critiques of his carpet - bagger approach first came when he and @entity10 bought a $ 5million estate in @entity41 , @entity9 , only to spend more time in a different district once it became clear that he would have a tough time winning the @entity45 nomination in that area			1
in 2010 , republicans @entity47 and @entity49 were elected to the 18th and 19th districts respectively			0
after just one term , @entity47 was ousted by @entity52 , a gay @entity53 who parallels @entity15 in his political beliefs making the prospect of fighting against one another less appealing			2
the @entity56 profiled the power couple in july and described how they first bought an 80 - acre estate in @entity41 - which was in the @entity59 and only an hour 's drive to their loft in @entity63 - and then later bought a property an hour further away in @entity65 - in the 19th district			1
the couple still own all three properties - the $ 5million estate in @entity41 , the $ 4,9million loft in @entity63 and the $ 2million home in @entity65			2
in his campaign video , @entity15 touts the work that he has done with local industries through @entity75 which he founded to help fund small businesses			2
he explains that he was born in @entity77 but makes no mention about the various moves throughout the state			0
' i love the @entity82 , it 's where i 'm building my home , my family , and my business , ' he said in the video			0
he also says that part of his motivation for the campaign is that he wants to ' reduce the interest in money and special interests in politics ' but pointedly omits any mention of his husband			0
power players : @entity15 has been making a name for himself in political circles , seen here with @entity101 senatorial candidate @entity100 , @entity102 and her husband @entity103 , who owns the @entity104 @entity10 has an estimated worth of $ 500million and now runs @entity106 magazine after having bought it last year			1
the price @entity10 paid for the majority stake in the storied media company was not publicly disclosed			2
the couple have been known to open their purse strings when it comes to things they care about , including their lavish wedding last july			0
they had the formal ceremony at the home in @entity41 , but then held a much bigger reception at @entity121 in @entity122			0
while the @entity41 ceremony only included 75 of their closest friends and family members , the @entity124 reception was extended to include 400 of their nearest and dearest including both @entity130 from @entity9 and media moguls like @entity132 and @entity10 ' old pal @entity13			1
though @entity15 's personal knowledge of the 19th district may be something he is building , he and @entity10 have been working within the realms of @entity9 state politics for years at this point			1
first attempt : the couple first purchased this $ 5million home in @entity41 , @entity9 ( pictured ) , but once it became clear that @entity15 would not win in that district they bought another house further upstate sleek : their latest property - a $ 2million two - bedroom in @entity65 - means that they are residents of @entity9 's @entity151 and on sunday @entity15 announced his candidacy in the @entity6 race for that area he has worked for a same - sex marriage group called @entity156 to marry since 2011 and the couple have raised thousands of dollars for governor @entity158			1
now @entity15 is officially trying to unseat @entity49 , the @entity159 congressman who has represented the 19th district since 2010 after being elected during a wave of @entity163 popularity			1
' one thing is clear , this race will test the hypothesis of whether congressional seats can be bought , ' @entity49 's spokeswoman @entity164 told @entity169 in a statement			0
' this comes as no surprise			0
he purchased a multimillion dollar home in our district in january , filed to run for @entity6 in february , and then cleared up his voter registration problems a few months later			2
he 's been raising money from wealthy friends while at the same time touting an economic plan that boils down to loaning his potential constituents money			0
' lavish : the well - connected couple invited 400 people to their july 2012 wedding at @entity124 in @entity122 ( their cake pictured at right and @entity15 seen at left from his campaign video )			0

@entity15 , 27 , is running for @entity6 in @entity9 's 19th district
@entity15 is married to @entity10 who helped his college roommate @entity13 launch @entity4 back when they were at @entity193
@entity10 , who is worth an estimated $ 500m , and @entity15 have bought three *multi-million* dollar properties in @entity9
