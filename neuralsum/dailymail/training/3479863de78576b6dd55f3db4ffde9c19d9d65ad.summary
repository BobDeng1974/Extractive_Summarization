he had it all to lose : @entity2 put his reputation and popularity at @entity5 on the line ahead of his second coming , as three words prayed on his mind : never go back			1
@entity2 could have looked through the history and run a mile when @entity5 made their move again			1
he would have seen plenty of examples , flashing like warning lights , of managers who fell way short when returning with ambition of recapturing former glories			1
no matter how much you think it will be as it was before , things never go to plan			2
i first realised that when i was a 12 - year - old staunch @entity24 and @entity23 returned to @entity25 in 1990			2
@entity23 struggled on his return to @entity24 , pictured in a 4 - 0 defeat at @entity28 in 1998 during his third stint , and a 4 - 1 loss to @entity31 ( right ) at @entity32 as far as i was concerned , @entity23 had the @entity33			2
@entity34 and @entity24 were the perfect match			2
i was adamant those days out at @entity32 and the trophies of his first reign would be on the agenda once more			2
what could go wrong ? plenty , as it turned out			2
his second spell fell way short of expectations , while his third , in 1997 - 98 , saw @entity24 avoid relegation on the final day of the season			2
he never got near another trophy			2
i played under @entity48 when he had his second attempt at managing @entity50			2
he was unfortunate to lose his job , particularly after we won the @entity53 and reached the @entity55 final in 2012 , but the difficulties we experienced in the @entity57 put things in context			2
@entity61 columnist @entity60 pictured with @entity48 after @entity50 's @entity55 final loss @entity48 was eventually replaced by former @entity64 boss @entity63 at the end of the 2012 season many supporters looked at @entity48 standing in the dugout and expected to see his team play breath - taking football as @entity50 did in 1987 - 88			1
@entity71 moves on and it could never have been as good as it had been before			2
@entity48 ’s situation , though , was not unique			2
an architect of the great @entity77 side that ruled in the early 1990s , where his successes included an astonishing 4 - 0 win over @entity80 in the 1994 @entity82 final , he returned to the @entity83 in 1997			2
@entity77 lost the @entity86 final , finished 10th in @entity87 and @entity74 called it the ' worst mistake he had ever made '			0
similarly , @entity90 ’s return to @entity80 in 2002 - 03 was awful			0
he was sacked within five months with the club languishing in 12th place			0
@entity74 and @entity93 celebrate after @entity77 won their fifth @entity82 in some style @entity96 supporters championed for the return of @entity98 in 2008 after his successful first stint but @entity98 resigned in september 2008 after just eight months back in charge of the club @entity90 's return to @entity80 in 2002 was a disaster and he was sacked after only five months the romance , the adulation and memories are a powerful mix. @entity98 hoped he would rekindle it with @entity96 in 2008 , @entity103 has wanted to go back to @entity50 ever since he left in 2010			1
emotion makes you think there will be no difference second time around			0
reality , however , tells you something different			0
so while @entity5 appointed the biggest managerial name in the world , there was no guarantee that there would be a sudden transformation in their fortunes			1
so what @entity2 has done over the last 18 months is shining example of why he is a serial winner , a demonstration of his talent			1
@entity5 , it needs pointing out , had n’t been in a title race since they won it under @entity128 in 2010 , finishing second , nine points adrift ( 10 - 11 ) , sixth ( 11 - 12 ) and third ( 12 - 13 )			1
the championship had become the city of @entity133 ’s property , with @entity50 getting closer than anybody to wrestling it away			0
the main action at the end of the campaign had been going on without @entity5			1
@entity2 appeared in high spirits during his pre-match @entity5 press conference on friday @entity5 are unbeaten in all competitions this season and their last defeat came back in april we wo n’t be saying that next may			1
@entity145 are the only ones who can halt @entity2 ’s juggernaut			1
he went into the season knowing his job would be on the line if he failed to win anything but no other manager can deliver so impressively under such pressure			0
@entity2 , of course , has a luxury that some managers do n’t			1
@entity5 are a wealthy club and have the capacity to pay big fees and wages			1
that was also the case in 2004			1
but @entity164 football has changed in the last decade and @entity5 no longer have the transfer market all their own way			1
their position at the top of the table , however , is not based purely on a chequebook , as the net spends since @entity2 returned of @entity172 ( £ 179.9million ) , @entity145 ( £ 113.8m ) , @entity28 ( £ 86.3m ) and @entity50 ( £ 64.4m ) show			1
@entity5 ’s net spend in the last three windows , for contrast , is £ 65.4m			1
true , he wo n’t baulk at paying a big transfer fee but , whenever he does , @entity2 gets it right			1
look at @entity179 , who has fitted in with ease			1
@entity181 , who @entity2 calls ' a giant ' , is another , as is @entity183			1
with @entity183 last season , @entity5 would have been champions			1
@entity179 , in action against @entity186 in @entity5 's 3 - 0 win on wednesday , has been a revelation this term @entity181 was brought back in january and @entity183 a summer arrival from @entity191 part of @entity2 ’s magic is the ability to get more out of players who are already at the club when he arrives			1
@entity197 , @entity198 and @entity199 were the first examples , @entity201 and @entity202 providing the evidence this time			0
he also has them playing a completely different brand			0
who would have expected @entity2 to include players like @entity202 , @entity179 and @entity208 in the same team ? @entity5 are still physically strong but now they move the ball with style and at speed			1
what makes this transition even more impressive is that he has been able phase out key figures such as @entity217 , @entity198 and @entity218 , with minimal fuss and no disruption to results			0
it has been so seamless , it is like he has never been away			0
@entity2 has constructed a complete team , one that could go through the season unbeaten , and his influence means they are the only @entity164 club with a chance of winning the @entity82 this year			1
given his record in the heavyweight games , it would be a brave man to bet against him			0
top players find fast track to dugout it was interesting to see @entity237 make the statement that @entity239 will certainly return to @entity28 to work in the future			0
@entity63 also said something similar about @entity242 having a role on the coaching staff at @entity50 one day and it left me thinking : is this the only way to keep top players in the game once their playing careers are over ? it looks like that is now the reality			0
in the past , there would have been an apprenticeship to serve when you started out as a coach			0
you would work your way up through the lower leagues , as @entity260 did			0
now what @entity237 and @entity63 are suggesting seems a great way to learn , rather than dropping down			0
@entity239 has been touted for another return to @entity28 on the coaching staff after spending his entire playing career with @entity50 , will @entity242 continue as a coach ? i am not being elitist saying that			0
i used to wonder how i would cope if i started out managing at a lower - league club that i knew nothing about			0
who would you buy ? would you have an assistant who knew that level of the game ? how long would you get in the job ? that is why this assistant role will be attractive to @entity239 and @entity242 , as it has been for @entity279			0
they would have chance to learn away from the firing line , dealing with good players at a club they know and have instant respect			0
but once in the role — or when thinking about the offer — there is a big question , as @entity237 highlighted : are you prepared to sacrifice your life for the job ? the truth is that the wealth in the game means players are not being forced into roles after playing			1
they can pick and choose			0
this week i 'm looking forward to : watching @entity299 and @entity300 try to stop super @entity301 there is no harder task for a defender in the @entity57 at present than trying to shackle @entity305			0
he is in a run of form like the one @entity309 enjoyed last season and he looks like scoring every time he steps on the pitch , so @entity24 ’s defenders will have their work cut out trying to contain the striker of the moment			0
@entity300 ( centre ) looks bemused after @entity24 concede a costly goal against @entity320 at @entity25 @entity305 ( right ) wheels away after scoring against @entity322 during his virtuoso outing on @entity324 @entity299 and @entity300 have been stalwarts at @entity25 and shared an excellent partnership for more than five years but , this season , @entity24 have been conceding more goals than normal and their performances have come under scrutiny			0
the best @entity24 performances in recent times have come on the back of them being difficult to break down and if @entity336 ’s side are going to leave the @entity337 with a positive result , then @entity299 and @entity300 will have to be back to their old selves .			0

it needs pointing out that @entity5 have not been in a title race since 2010
as in 2004 , @entity5 have the luxury of wealth , but @entity164 football has changed and they no longer have the transfer market all their own way
and whenever @entity2 gets the chequebook out he gets it right *...* just look at the signings of @entity179 , @entity181 and @entity183
he has constructed a complete team , one that could go unbeaten this term
