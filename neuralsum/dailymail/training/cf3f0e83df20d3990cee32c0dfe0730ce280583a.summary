@entity0 has received a patent for a technology that could revolutionise searching - as well as giving the search engine unprecedented knowledge about the world			1
humans have an innate ability , thanks to our eyes and brain , to look at any object - from a cat to a lamp to a river - bank - and recognise it and catalogue it			0
this is far less easy for computers to do - but @entity0 may be about to change that , thanks to its patent for ' automatic large scale video object recognition '			2
indexing the world : @entity0 has received a patent for technology that could identify and tag objects according to indicators such as colour , movement and features the patent describes technology that can scan a video - for instance the thousands of hours uploaded to @entity34 each day - and then pick out landmarks , objects and context , helping it to tag and categorise it			1
for instance , you could have your photo taken outside @entity43 in @entity44 , or film a short video outside @entity44 's most - famous clock , upload it to @entity0 , and without giving any more data , @entity0 could tag your video with ' @entity43 ' and ' @entity44 '			1
the patent could signal a revolution in how we use the internet , especially if the technology becomes embedded in smartphones - but is likely to cause a lot of concern over privacy issues			0
civil liberty groups have already warned that this could provide @entity0 with a wealth of personal detail about your private life			2
@entity62 has already captured a wealth of images through van - based cameras - and analysis of this data could tell the search engine even more about the world with @entity34 being the biggest video destination on the @entity78 , ' @entity76 ' streaming live video from people 's sunglasses , and @entity74 phones spreading across the world , @entity0 may soon have eyes all over the planet - and for the first time , understand what it is seeing			1
@entity0 states it plans to have an ' object name repository ' containing 50,000 objects to help it mix and match			2
this may range from a variety of items , from the simple , such as landmarks , to quite specific identifiers			0
for instance , @entity92 gives the example that if the database contains the ears of a cat , it will help @entity0 pick out cats in any video , which is useful as one thing the @entity78 has in abundance is videos of cats			1
in the patent , @entity0 said : ' conventional systems rely on direct human input to provide object exemplars explicitly labeled as representing the object , such as a set of images known to include , for example , dogs , based on prior human examination			0
' however , such human input is expensive , time - consuming , and can not scale up to handle very large data sets comprising hundreds of thousands of objects and millions of images			0
' @entity118 , director of privacy and civil liberties campaign group @entity120 , said : ' yet again this looks like users losing control of what happens to their data			1
' if information about your location is instantly added to photos , not only does it alert people to where you are it means @entity0 can associate your identity with even more information , like where you â€™ve visited and whether you have pets			0
' this kind of service should be opt - in and @entity0 should absolutely not be using it to harvest more data about us if people do not clearly give their consent			0

@entity0 will be able to scan any video or image and pick out objects
search engine will be able to index all the *un-tagged* data on the internet
civil liberties group warns of privacy concerns as @entity0 gets smarter and smarter
