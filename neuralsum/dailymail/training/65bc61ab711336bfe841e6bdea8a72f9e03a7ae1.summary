@entity1 chairman @entity0 confirmed on saturday that legendary @entity3 striker @entity2 has applied to become the next manager of the @entity6 club			1
speaking before the 4 - 0 defeat to @entity8 which left his side very much rooted to the foot of the @entity12 table , @entity0 revealed the @entity14 winner is among the list of candidates to succeed @entity17 , who was sacked earlier this week along with his director of football father , @entity18			1
‘ i can not believe the quality of applicants , ’ @entity0 said			1
that response , five years ago , would never have happened and it would n’t have happened two years ago			0
‘ the credit for putting @entity1 on the map goes back to @entity18 and @entity17 and i ’d like to thank them for that			1
the calibre of applicant has been really good			0
’ @entity2 is a managerial rookie but the former @entity40 and @entity41 striker helped @entity42 for @entity25 in this summer ’s @entity43 and is keen to get involved in management in @entity45			1
former @entity47 manager @entity46 has also been linked with the post , as has one - time @entity49 and @entity51 boss @entity50			1
‘ @entity50 certainly was a motivator ( at @entity49 ) , he did a wonderful job there , ’ added @entity0			1
‘ he has an affiliation with the @entity56			0
experience : @entity2 ( centre ) has never managed but he has worked alongside @entity42 ( left ) at @entity25 ‘ an affiliation with the @entity56 is really important and that they understand what our area is about			2
’ meanwhile , @entity1 ’s caretaker boss @entity64 , who was @entity17 ’ assistant , admitted the sacking of the man who guided the @entity69 to the @entity70 in 2010 had taken its toll on the players as they were humbled by @entity8			1
after a @entity77 header , a @entity75 double and @entity74 ’s strike had consigned his side to defeat , @entity79 said : ‘ it ’s not been an easy week for anyone involved with the club and its not ended any better			0
‘ you have to give credit to @entity8 , they were the better team			0
interested : former @entity47 manager @entity46 ( left ) and @entity87 boss @entity50 have applied ‘ a difficult week took its toll			1
the players have shown me great respect in the last two days and prepared for this as well as they could			0
' they all gave 100 per cent , but we got well beaten			0
it ’s very different to replace a manager who has done as much for a club like ours			0
i do n’t know who is coming in to replace @entity17			2
that is up to the chairman			2
’ @entity75 , who netted both goals from the spot , revealed he fancies his chances against any goalkeeper from 12 yards - because he gets tips from @entity107 1 @entity108 , who himself saved a penalty from @entity111 at 3 - 0			0
@entity75 said : ‘ i practice penalties with @entity108 and we can take tips from each other			0
’ spell in @entity115 : @entity2 played for @entity116 for a year during an illustrious career for club and country			2
