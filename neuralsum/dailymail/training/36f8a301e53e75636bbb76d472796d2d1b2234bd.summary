by @entity0 @entity1 was made aware of an alleged plot by @entity4 extremists to infiltrate a number of schools in the @entity8 area , reports today suggest fears over an alleged extremist plot to infiltrate a number of @entity8 schools were raised to then prime minister @entity14 20 years ago , reports suggest			1
the leaders of three schools in @entity8 , @entity17 , are said to have written to education ministers and mr @entity14 over their concerns regarding extremist group @entity20 in the 1990s			1
@entity22 , a former governor at @entity23 , even had a @entity25 meeting with the education minister @entity26 , it is claimed			1
mr @entity22 today told @entity27 : ' ( @entity29 plot ) reveals something , something that is true			1
' it reveals a mess that the city council has not been able to check - the development of this whole infiltration of this ceding in of governors of one particular ideology			0
' they are not people who have the welfare of these children at heart			0
' mr @entity22 resigned from his role at the school after 25 years in 2013 when it was taken over by the @entity47 - which is headed by @entity48			2
mr @entity48 is accused of attempting to convert secular , state - funded schools to @entity4			1
however , mr @entity51 's claims have been questioned by other senior members of staff at the school @entity56 , another former governor , said : ' @entity22 never expressed any concerns , never asked " why have you joined the governing body ? " ' i 'm quite concerned that he can actually say there was a mass movement to go into governing bodies			1
i certainly have n't experienced it at @entity23 , or another school i was governor at			2
' a @entity67 spokesperson said : ' there is absolutely no place for extremism in schools			0
' since 2010 we have taken a number of steps to strengthen our capability to deal with extremism in schools , including setting up a dedicated counter extremism unit within the @entity67			0
' we have also worked with @entity79 to strengthen inspectors ' capacity to identify and report on extremism in schools			2
' @entity79 has inspected a number of schools in the light of recent allegations and will report to the secretary of state shortly			2
retired senior police officer @entity89 has been asked by the @entity88 to make a full enquiry into @entity8 schools and will report back this summer			1
' the claims come as three schools inspected over the alleged @entity29 plot by hard - line @entity95 have been given a clean bill of health by @entity79			1
@entity99 , an @entity100 in @entity101 , @entity102 , and @entity100 , were all given good or outstanding ratings by the education watchdog			1
the schools then published their results letters today - which concluded children - safeguarding standards were being met by the all of the institutions			0
@entity22 , a former governor at @entity23 , claims he and officials from two other schools wrote to education ministers in the 90s raising their concerns over extremist group @entity116 - @entity20 the schools are the first to publish the results of their inspections after the education secretary @entity120 sent @entity79 in over the @entity29 allegations			1
in all , 21 schools have been inspected after the so - called letter - now widely believed to be a hoax - referred to an alleged plot by hard - line @entity95 to seize control of governing boards in the city , dubbed @entity130			1
meanwhile today , @entity47 ( @entity131 ) which has been the focus of the most damning allegations , issued a statement criticising ' leaks ' of other unpublished @entity136 being reported in the media , stating it was causing ' unwarranted and unnecessary concern ' for children and parents			0
for its part , @entity141 , which runs three other city schools , has denied any wrong - doing , with trust chairman @entity48 calling the allegations ' a witch - hunt '			0
whatever the truth of the original letter , alleging the existence of a five - point plan to seize control of school governing boards by seeding them with hard - line @entity4 governors , the fall - out caused mr @entity120 in april to appoint as education commissioner @entity89 , the former head of the @entity156 ’s counter-terror unit			2
a separate over-arching report by the head of @entity79 and chief inspector of schools sir @entity161 is now expected to be published next week , along with any remaining @entity79 reports for the individual schools concerned			2
the @entity165 mp for @entity167 @entity166 , where many of the schools being probed are located , said the volume of leaks from those reports meant the entire investigation risked a descent into ' complete shambles ' , calling on the @entity67 ( @entity67 ) and @entity79 to publish their findings immediately			2
the man accused of masterminding the @entity29 plot , @entity48			2
mr @entity22 says he left @entity23 after it was taken over by @entity47 , which is headed by mr @entity48 inspectors wrote to the three schools which today published their results on may 12			1
at @entity99 in @entity101 inspectors sent in by mr @entity120 found children safeguarding requirements were being met , praising leadership and governance under executive principal @entity187 as ' outstanding '			0
headteacher of @entity102 , @entity189 , was told there were ' effective safeguarding procedures ' in his classrooms , while leadership and governance was also ' outstanding '			0
@entity22 , former governor at @entity23 at @entity100 , inspectors found governance and leadership to be ' good ' adding students were ' well informed ' both about other cultures and the risks of extremism and bullying , concluding pupils at the academy were well - rounded and believed it was ' acceptable to be different '			1
at @entity102 , inspectors praised the high level of tolerance , stating in their letter to the head : ' a major strength of the school is that students value the differences between people of different beliefs , race and backgrounds			0
' this has been achieved through a balanced curriculum for religious education and wide - ranging opportunities for personal development			0
' inspectors thought the school so good it went on to criticise local education authority @entity224 because ' it has not done enough to help the school share its good practice with other schools in the city '			2
at nearby @entity230 , students were found to be tolerant and well - behaved while there was consistently “ strong leadership ” from headteacher @entity233			0
inspectors concluded : ' they ( students ) know about risks related to religious extremism , sexual health , drug misuse , use of the internet and social media and different forms of bullying			0
' students are taught to respect the things that make people different such as sexual orientation , appearance , ability and race			0
the @entity250 in @entity8 - which is alleged to have been infiltrated by @entity4 extremists who are attempting to change the school			1
it has received the most scrutiny of the 21 schools alleged to be involved ' students say that it is acceptable to be different at the academy			0
' @entity79 added the ' executive headteacher , and key members of the board of governors , have provided a strong lead on issues of religious extremism '			0
numerous media reports , quoting anonymous sources , have claimed @entity79 is poised to place several @entity8 schools into special measures after inspections sparked by an unsigned letter purporting to contain details of the alleged takeover plot			1
claims have also emerged that concerns about the management of a school embroiled in the row were first raised with council officials as early as 2008			0
the @entity29 letter , which was unsigned , undated and first sent to council officials and teaching unions late last year , has sparked several separate investigations including by @entity224 and @entity284			0
meanwhile , @entity47 which runs @entity285 , @entity286 and @entity23 , said it would not comment on speculative and ' highly irresponsible ' reports in the media based on @entity79 reports which had not yet been published			1
highlighting the academic success of @entity141 ’s students , the trust said : ' if the inspectors who carried out both inspections at @entity285 have ignored these achievements then we have to conclude that they are working to a different set of criteria than is normally used for an @entity79 inspection			0
' the so - called @entity29 plot first came to light earlier this year			2
@entity67 inspectors were ordered into @entity250 in @entity8 along with its sister schools , @entity23 and @entity304 , after a letter dubbed ' @entity29 ' - now thought to be a hoax - was uncovered			1
it allegedly outlined a plot by @entity4 hardliners to drive moderate headteachers out of schools			1
whistleblowers at @entity141 have claimed the school is in the hands of a group of extremists who infiltrated the governing body			0
it is alleged girls at the school were forced to sit at the back of the classroom and @entity324 pupils forced to teach themselves at the state school			0
the letter prompted separate ongoing investigations by both the @entity67 ( @entity67 ) and @entity79 in to the school and several others in the area			2
police , the government and school inspectors are thought to be investigating alleged attempts by radicals to seize control of 20 schools in the city after claims of plot emerged in march			1
the @entity67 has also appointed its own education commissioner , the former head of the @entity156 ’s counter-terrorism unit @entity89 for the investigation			0
yesterday , six schools at the centre of an alleged @entity347 takeover plot are facing radical reform and even closure after being officially judged as failing , it emerged last night			1
a three - month inquiry has found the @entity8 schools did too little to protect children from extremism and female staff were intimidated			1
one of the six , @entity23 , was rated ‘ inadequate ’ in every criteria			0
a leaked copy of its @entity79 report says ‘ staff views are polarised ’ about leadership and that sex and relationships education has not been delivered properly			2
however , three were today given ' outstanding ' or ' good ' results by the education watchdog .			1

fears over plot to infiltrate @entity8 schools raised in 90s , it is claimed
three schools said to have written to @entity14 and education ministers
claims of @entity22 , former official at @entity23 , *disputed* today
three other schools in area given ' good ' or ' outstanding ' ratings by @entity79
